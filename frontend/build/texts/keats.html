<a id='line_177'>LIFE OF KEATS</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>Of all the great poets of the early nineteenth century--Wordsworth,</a>
<a id='line_181'>Coleridge, Scott, Byron, Shelley, Keats--John Keats was the last born</a>
<a id='line_182'>and the first to die. The length of his life was not one-third that of</a>
<a id='line_183'>Wordsworth, who was born twenty-five years before him and outlived him</a>
<a id='line_184'>by twenty-nine. Yet before his tragic death at twenty-six Keats had</a>
<a id='line_185'>produced a body of poetry of such extraordinary power and promise that</a>
<a id='line_186'>the world has sometimes been tempted, in its regret for what he might</a>
<a id='line_187'>have done had he lived, to lose sight of the superlative merit of what</a>
<a id='line_188'>he actually accomplished.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>The three years of his poetic career, during which he published three</a>
<a id='line_191'>small volumes of poetry, show a development at the same time rapid and</a>
<a id='line_192'>steady, and a gradual but complete abandonment of almost every fault and</a>
<a id='line_193'>weakness. It would probably be impossible, in the history of literature,</a>
<a id='line_194'>to find such another instance of the 'growth of a poet's mind'.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>The last of these three volumes, which is here reprinted, was published</a>
<a id='line_197'>in 1820, when it 'had good success among the literary people and . . . a</a>
<a id='line_198'>moderate sale'. It contains the flower of his poetic production and is</a>
<a id='line_199'>perhaps, altogether, one of the most marvellous volumes ever issued from</a>
<a id='line_200'>the press.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>But in spite of the maturity of Keats's work when he was twenty-five, he</a>
<a id='line_203'>had been in no sense a precocious child. Born in 1795 in the city of</a>
<a id='line_204'>London, the son of a livery-stable keeper, he was brought up amid</a>
<a id='line_205'>surroundings and influences by no means calculated to awaken poetic</a>
<a id='line_206'>genius.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>He was the eldest of five--four boys, one of whom died in infancy, and a</a>
<a id='line_209'>girl younger than all; and he and his brothers George and Tom were</a>
<a id='line_210'>educated at a private school at Enfield. Here John was at first</a>
<a id='line_211'>distinguished more for fighting than for study, whilst his bright,</a>
<a id='line_212'>brave, generous nature made him popular with masters and boys.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>Soon after he had begun to go to school his father died, and when he was</a>
<a id='line_215'>fifteen the children lost their mother too. Keats was passionately</a>
<a id='line_216'>devoted to his mother; during her last illness he would sit up all night</a>
<a id='line_217'>with her, give her her medicine, and even cook her food himself. At her</a>
<a id='line_218'>death he was brokenhearted.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>The children were now put under the care of two guardians, one of whom,</a>
<a id='line_221'>Mr. Abbey, taking the sole responsibility, immediately removed John from</a>
<a id='line_222'>school and apprenticed him for five years to a surgeon at Edmonton.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>Whilst thus employed Keats spent all his leisure time in reading, for</a>
<a id='line_225'>which he had developed a great enthusiasm during his last two years at</a>
<a id='line_226'>school. There he had devoured every book that came in his way,</a>
<a id='line_227'>especially rejoicing in stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient</a>
<a id='line_228'>Greece. At Edmonton he was able to continue his studies by borrowing</a>
<a id='line_229'>books from his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, the son of his</a>
<a id='line_230'>schoolmaster, and he often went over to Enfield to change his books and</a>
<a id='line_231'>to discuss those which he had been reading. On one of these occasions</a>
<a id='line_232'>Cowden Clarke introduced him to Spenser, to whom so many poets have owed</a>
<a id='line_233'>their first inspiration that he has been called 'the poets' poet'; and</a>
<a id='line_234'>it was then, apparently, that Keats was first prompted to write.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>When he was nineteen, a year before his apprenticeship came to an end,</a>
<a id='line_237'>he quarrelled with his master, left him, and continued his training in</a>
<a id='line_238'>London as a student at St. Thomas's Hospital and Guy's. Gradually,</a>
<a id='line_239'>however, during the months that followed, though he was an industrious</a>
<a id='line_240'>and able medical student, Keats came to realize that poetry was his true</a>
<a id='line_241'>vocation; and as soon as he was of age, in spite of the opposition of</a>
<a id='line_242'>his guardian, he decided to abandon the medical profession and devote</a>
<a id='line_243'>his life to literature.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>If Mr. Abbey was unsympathetic Keats was not without encouragement from</a>
<a id='line_246'>others. His brothers always believed in him whole-heartedly, and his</a>
<a id='line_247'>exceptionally lovable nature had won him many friends. Amongst these</a>
<a id='line_248'>friends two men older than himself, each famous in his own sphere, had</a>
<a id='line_249'>special influence upon him.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>One of them, Leigh Hunt, was something of a poet himself and a pleasant</a>
<a id='line_252'>prose-writer. His encouragement did much to stimulate Keats's genius,</a>
<a id='line_253'>but his direct influence on his poetry was wholly bad. Leigh Hunt's was</a>
<a id='line_254'>not a deep nature; his poetry is often trivial and sentimental, and his</a>
<a id='line_255'>easy conversational style is intolerable when applied to a great theme.</a>
<a id='line_256'>To this man's influence, as well as to the surroundings of his youth,</a>
<a id='line_257'>are doubtless due the occasional flaws of taste in Keats's early work.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>The other, Haydon, was an artist of mediocre creative talent but great</a>
<a id='line_260'>aims and amazing belief in himself. He had a fine critical faculty which</a>
<a id='line_261'>was shown in his appreciation of the Elgin marbles, in opposition to the</a>
<a id='line_262'>most respected authorities of his day. Mainly through his insistence</a>
<a id='line_263'>they were secured for the nation which thus owes him a boundless debt of</a>
<a id='line_264'>gratitude. He helped to guide and direct Keats's taste by his</a>
<a id='line_265'>enthusiastic exposition of these masterpieces of Greek sculpture.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>In 1817 Keats published his first volume of poems, including 'Sleep and</a>
<a id='line_268'>Poetry' and the well-known lines 'I stood tiptoe upon a little hill'.</a>
<a id='line_269'>With much that is of the highest poetic value, many memorable lines and</a>
<a id='line_270'>touches of his unique insight into nature, the volume yet showed</a>
<a id='line_271'>considerable immaturity. It contained indeed, if we except one perfect</a>
<a id='line_272'>sonnet, rather a series of experiments than any complete and finished</a>
<a id='line_273'>work. There were abundant faults for those who liked to look for them,</a>
<a id='line_274'>though there were abundant beauties too; and the critics and the public</a>
<a id='line_275'>chose rather to concentrate their attention on the former. The volume</a>
<a id='line_276'>was therefore anything but a success; but Keats was not discouraged, for</a>
<a id='line_277'>he saw many of his own faults more clearly than did his critics, and</a>
<a id='line_278'>felt his power to outgrow them.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>Immediately after this Keats went to the Isle of Wight and thence to</a>
<a id='line_281'>Margate that he might study and write undisturbed. On May 10th he wrote</a>
<a id='line_282'>to Haydon--'I never quite despair, and I read Shakespeare--indeed I</a>
<a id='line_283'>shall, I think, never read any other book much'. We have seen Keats</a>
<a id='line_284'>influenced by Spenser and by Leigh Hunt: now, though his love for</a>
<a id='line_285'>Spenser continued, Shakespeare's had become the dominant influence.</a>
<a id='line_286'>Gradually he came too under the influence of Wordsworth's philosophy of</a>
<a id='line_287'>poetry and life, and later his reading of Milton affected his style to</a>
<a id='line_288'>some extent, but Shakespeare's influence was the widest, deepest and</a>
<a id='line_289'>most lasting, though it is the hardest to define. His study of other</a>
<a id='line_290'>poets left traces upon his work in turns of phrase or turns of thought:</a>
<a id='line_291'>Shakespeare permeated his whole being, and his influence is to be</a>
<a id='line_292'>detected not in a resemblance of style, for Shakespeare can have no</a>
<a id='line_293'>imitators, but in a broadening view of life, and increased humanity.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>No poet could have owed his education more completely to the English</a>
<a id='line_296'>poets than did John Keats. His knowledge of Latin was slight--he knew no</a>
<a id='line_297'>Greek, and even the classical stories which he loved and constantly</a>
<a id='line_298'>used, came to him almost entirely through the medium of Elizabethan</a>
<a id='line_299'>translations and allusions. In this connexion it is interesting to read</a>
<a id='line_300'>his first fine sonnet, in which he celebrates his introduction to the</a>
<a id='line_301'>greatest of Greek poets in the translation of the rugged and forcible</a>
<a id='line_302'>Elizabethan, George Chapman:--</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>     _On first looking into Chapman's Homer._</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>     Much have I travelled in the realms of gold,</a>
<a id='line_307'>     And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;</a>
<a id='line_308'>     Round many western islands have I been</a>
<a id='line_309'>     Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.</a>
<a id='line_310'>     Oft of one wide expanse had I been told</a>
<a id='line_311'>     That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;</a>
<a id='line_312'>     Yet did I never breathe its pure serene</a>
<a id='line_313'>     Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:</a>
<a id='line_314'>     Then felt I like some watcher of the skies</a>
<a id='line_315'>     When a new planet swims into his ken;</a>
<a id='line_316'>     Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes</a>
<a id='line_317'>     He stared at the Pacific--and all his men</a>
<a id='line_318'>     Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--</a>
<a id='line_319'>     Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>Of the work upon which he was now engaged, the narrative-poem of</a>
<a id='line_322'>_Endymion_, we may give his own account to his little sister Fanny in a</a>
<a id='line_323'>letter dated September 10th, 1817:--</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>'Perhaps you might like to know what I am writing about. I will tell</a>
<a id='line_326'>you. Many years ago there was a young handsome Shepherd who fed his</a>
<a id='line_327'>flocks on a Mountain's Side called Latmus--he was a very contemplative</a>
<a id='line_328'>sort of a Person and lived solitary among the trees and Plains little</a>
<a id='line_329'>thinking that such a beautiful Creature as the Moon was growing mad in</a>
<a id='line_330'>Love with him.--However so it was; and when he was asleep she used to</a>
<a id='line_331'>come down from heaven and admire him excessively for a long time; and at</a>
<a id='line_332'>last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of</a>
<a id='line_333'>that high Mountain Latmus while he was a dreaming--but I dare say you</a>
<a id='line_334'>have read this and all the other beautiful tales which have come down</a>
<a id='line_335'>from the ancient times of that beautiful Greece.'</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>On his return to London he and his brother Tom, always delicate and now</a>
<a id='line_338'>quite an invalid, took lodgings at Hampstead. Here Keats remained for</a>
<a id='line_339'>some time, harassed by the illness of his brother and of several of his</a>
<a id='line_340'>friends; and in June he was still further depressed by the departure of</a>
<a id='line_341'>his brother George to try his luck in America.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>In April, 1818, _Endymion_ was finished. Keats was by no means</a>
<a id='line_344'>satisfied with it but preferred to publish it as it was, feeling it to</a>
<a id='line_345'>be 'as good as I had power to make it by myself'.--'I will write</a>
<a id='line_346'>independently' he says to his publisher--'I have written independently</a>
<a id='line_347'>_without judgment_. I may write independently and _with judgment_</a>
<a id='line_348'>hereafter. In _Endymion_ I leaped headlong into the sea, and thereby</a>
<a id='line_349'>have become better acquainted with the soundings, the quicksands, and</a>
<a id='line_350'>the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore, and piped a silly</a>
<a id='line_351'>pipe, and took tea and comfortable advice.' He published it with a</a>
<a id='line_352'>preface modestly explaining to the public his own sense of its</a>
<a id='line_353'>imperfection. Nevertheless a storm of abuse broke upon him from the</a>
<a id='line_354'>critics who fastened upon all the faults of the poem--the diffuseness of</a>
<a id='line_355'>the story, its occasional sentimentality and the sometimes fantastic</a>
<a id='line_356'>coinage of words,[xiii:1] and ignored the extraordinary beauties of</a>
<a id='line_357'>which it is full.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>Directly after the publication of _Endymion_, and before the appearance</a>
<a id='line_360'>of these reviews, Keats started with a friend, Charles Brown, for a</a>
<a id='line_361'>walking tour in Scotland. They first visited the English lakes and</a>
<a id='line_362'>thence walked to Dumfries, where they saw the house of Burns and his</a>
<a id='line_363'>grave. They entered next the country of Meg Merrilies, and from</a>
<a id='line_364'>Kirkcudbrightshire crossed over to Ireland for a few days. On their</a>
<a id='line_365'>return they went north as far as Argyleshire, whence they sailed to</a>
<a id='line_366'>Staffa and saw Fingal's cave, which, Keats wrote, 'for solemnity and</a>
<a id='line_367'>grandeur far surpasses the finest Cathedral.' They then crossed Scotland</a>
<a id='line_368'>through Inverness, and Keats returned home by boat from Cromarty.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>His letters home are at first full of interest and enjoyment, but a</a>
<a id='line_371'>'slight sore throat', contracted in 'a most wretched walk of</a>
<a id='line_372'>thirty-seven miles across the Isle of Mull', proved very troublesome and</a>
<a id='line_373'>finally cut short his holiday. This was the beginning of the end. There</a>
<a id='line_374'>was consumption in the family: Tom was dying of it; and the cold, wet,</a>
<a id='line_375'>and over-exertion of his Scotch tour seems to have developed the fatal</a>
<a id='line_376'>tendency in Keats himself.</a>
<a id='line_377'></a>
<a id='line_378'>From this time forward he was never well, and no good was done to either</a>
<a id='line_379'>his health or spirits by the task which now awaited him of tending on</a>
<a id='line_380'>his dying brother. For the last two or three months of 1818, until</a>
<a id='line_381'>Tom's death in December, he scarcely left the bedside, and it was well</a>
<a id='line_382'>for him that his friend, Charles Armitage Brown, was at hand to help and</a>
<a id='line_383'>comfort him after the long strain. Brown persuaded Keats at once to</a>
<a id='line_384'>leave the house, with its sad associations, and to come and live with</a>
<a id='line_385'>him.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>Before long poetry absorbed Keats again; and the first few months of</a>
<a id='line_388'>1819 were the most fruitful of his life. Besides working at _Hyperion_,</a>
<a id='line_389'>which he had begun during Tom's illness, he wrote _The Eve of St.</a>
<a id='line_390'>Agnes_, _The Eve of St. Mark_, _La Belle Dame Sans Merci_, and nearly</a>
<a id='line_391'>all his famous odes.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>Troubles however beset him. His friend Haydon was in difficulties and</a>
<a id='line_394'>tormenting him, poor as he was, to lend him money; the state of his</a>
<a id='line_395'>throat gave serious cause for alarm; and, above all, he was consumed by</a>
<a id='line_396'>an unsatisfying passion for the daughter of a neighbour, Mrs. Brawne.</a>
<a id='line_397'>She had rented Brown's house whilst they were in Scotland, and had now</a>
<a id='line_398'>moved to a street near by. Miss Fanny Brawne returned his love, but she</a>
<a id='line_399'>seems never to have understood his nature or his needs. High-spirited</a>
<a id='line_400'>and fond of pleasure she did not apparently allow the thought of her</a>
<a id='line_401'>invalid lover to interfere much with her enjoyment of life. She would</a>
<a id='line_402'>not, however, abandon her engagement, and she probably gave him all</a>
<a id='line_403'>which it was in her nature to give. Ill-health made him, on the other</a>
<a id='line_404'>hand, morbidly dissatisfied and suspicious; and, as a result of his</a>
<a id='line_405'>illness and her limitations, his love throughout brought him</a>
<a id='line_406'>restlessness and torment rather than peace and comfort.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>Towards the end of July he went to Shanklin and there, in collaboration</a>
<a id='line_409'>with Brown, wrote a play, _Otho the Great_. Brown tells us how they used</a>
<a id='line_410'>to sit, one on either side of a table, he sketching out the scenes and</a>
<a id='line_411'>handing each one, as the outline was finished, to Keats to write. As</a>
<a id='line_412'>Keats never knew what was coming it was quite impossible that the</a>
<a id='line_413'>characters should be adequately conceived, or that the drama should be a</a>
<a id='line_414'>united whole. Nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising</a>
<a id='line_415'>in it. It should not be forgotten that Keats's 'greatest ambition' was,</a>
<a id='line_416'>in his own words, 'the writing of a few fine plays'; and, with the</a>
<a id='line_417'>increasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows, there is no reason</a>
<a id='line_418'>to suppose that, had he lived, he would not have fulfilled it.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>At Shanklin, moreover, he had begun to write _Lamia_, and he continued</a>
<a id='line_421'>it at Winchester. Here he stayed until the middle of October, excepting</a>
<a id='line_422'>a few days which he spent in London to arrange about the sending of some</a>
<a id='line_423'>money to his brother in America. George had been unsuccessful in his</a>
<a id='line_424'>commercial enterprises, and Keats, in view of his family's ill-success,</a>
<a id='line_425'>determined temporarily to abandon poetry, and by reviewing or journalism</a>
<a id='line_426'>to support himself and earn money to help his brother. Then, when he</a>
<a id='line_427'>could afford it, he would return to poetry.</a>
<a id='line_428'></a>
<a id='line_429'>Accordingly he came back to London, but his health was breaking down,</a>
<a id='line_430'>and with it his resolution. He tried to re-write _Hyperion_, which he</a>
<a id='line_431'>felt had been written too much under the influence of Milton and in 'the</a>
<a id='line_432'>artist's humour'. The same independence of spirit which he had shown in</a>
<a id='line_433'>the publication of _Endymion_ urged him now to abandon a work the style</a>
<a id='line_434'>of which he did not feel to be absolutely his own. The re-cast he wrote</a>
<a id='line_435'>in the form of a vision, calling it _The Fall of Hyperion_, and in so</a>
<a id='line_436'>doing he added much to his conception of the meaning of the story. In no</a>
<a id='line_437'>poem does he show more of the profoundly philosophic spirit which</a>
<a id='line_438'>characterizes many of his letters. But it was too late; his power was</a>
<a id='line_439'>failing and, in spite of the beauty and interest of some of his</a>
<a id='line_440'>additions, the alterations are mostly for the worse.</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>Whilst _The Fall of Hyperion_ occupied his evenings his mornings were</a>
<a id='line_443'>spent over a satirical fairy-poem, _The Cap and Bells_, in the metre of</a>
<a id='line_444'>the _Faerie Queene_. This metre, however, was ill-suited to the subject;</a>
<a id='line_445'>satire was not natural to him, and the poem has little intrinsic merit.</a>
<a id='line_446'></a>
<a id='line_447'>Neither this nor the re-cast of _Hyperion_ was finished when, in</a>
<a id='line_448'>February, 1820, he had an attack of illness in which the first definite</a>
<a id='line_449'>symptom of consumption appeared. Brown tells how he came home on the</a>
<a id='line_450'>evening of Thursday, February 3rd, in a state of high fever, chilled</a>
<a id='line_451'>from having ridden outside the coach on a bitterly cold day. 'He mildly</a>
<a id='line_452'>and instantly yielded to my request that he should go to bed . . . On</a>
<a id='line_453'>entering the cold sheets, before his head was on the pillow, he slightly</a>
<a id='line_454'>coughed, and I heard him say--"that is blood from my mouth". I went</a>
<a id='line_455'>towards him: he was examining a single drop of blood upon the sheet.</a>
<a id='line_456'>"Bring me the candle, Brown, and let me see this blood." After regarding</a>
<a id='line_457'>it steadfastly he looked up in my face with a calmness of expression</a>
<a id='line_458'>that I can never forget, and said, "I know the colour of that blood;--it</a>
<a id='line_459'>is arterial blood; I cannot be deceived in that colour; that drop of</a>
<a id='line_460'>blood is my death warrant;--I must die."'</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>He lived for another year, but it was one long dying: he himself called</a>
<a id='line_463'>it his 'posthumous life'.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>Keats was one of the most charming of letter-writers. He had that rare</a>
<a id='line_466'>quality of entering sympathetically into the mind of the friend to whom</a>
<a id='line_467'>he was writing, so that his letters reveal to us much of the character</a>
<a id='line_468'>of the recipient as well as of the writer. In the long journal-letters</a>
<a id='line_469'>which he wrote to his brother and sister-in-law in America he is</a>
<a id='line_470'>probably most fully himself, for there he is with the people who knew</a>
<a id='line_471'>him best and on whose understanding and sympathy he could rely. But in</a>
<a id='line_472'>none is the beauty of his character more fully revealed than in those to</a>
<a id='line_473'>his little sister Fanny, now seventeen years old, and living with their</a>
<a id='line_474'>guardian, Mr. Abbey. He had always been very anxious that they should</a>
<a id='line_475'>'become intimately acquainted, in order', as he says, 'that I may not</a>
<a id='line_476'>only, as you grow up, love you as my only Sister, but confide in you as</a>
<a id='line_477'>my dearest friend.' In his most harassing times he continued to write to</a>
<a id='line_478'>her, directing her reading, sympathizing in her childish troubles, and</a>
<a id='line_479'>constantly thinking of little presents to please her. Her health was to</a>
<a id='line_480'>him a matter of paramount concern, and in his last letters to her we</a>
<a id='line_481'>find him reiterating warnings to take care of herself--'You must be</a>
<a id='line_482'>careful always to wear warm clothing not only in Frost but in a</a>
<a id='line_483'>Thaw.'--'Be careful to let no fretting injure your health as I have</a>
<a id='line_484'>suffered it--health is the greatest of blessings--with _health_ and</a>
<a id='line_485'>_hope_ we should be content to live, and so you will find as you grow</a>
<a id='line_486'>older.' The constant recurrence of this thought becomes, in the light of</a>
<a id='line_487'>his own sufferings, almost unbearably pathetic.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>During the first months of his illness Keats saw through the press his</a>
<a id='line_490'>last volume of poetry, of which this is a reprint. The praise which it</a>
<a id='line_491'>received from reviewers and public was in marked contrast to the</a>
<a id='line_492'>scornful reception of his earlier works, and would have augured well for</a>
<a id='line_493'>the future. But Keats was past caring much for poetic fame. He dragged</a>
<a id='line_494'>on through the summer, with rallies and relapses, tormented above all by</a>
<a id='line_495'>the thought that death would separate him from the woman he loved. Only</a>
<a id='line_496'>Brown, of all his friends, knew what he was suffering, and it seems that</a>
<a id='line_497'>he only knew fully after they were parted.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>The doctors warned Keats that a winter in England would kill him, so in</a>
<a id='line_500'>September, 1820, he left London for Naples, accompanied by a young</a>
<a id='line_501'>artist, Joseph Severn, one of his many devoted friends. Shelley, who</a>
<a id='line_502'>knew him slightly, invited him to stay at Pisa, but Keats refused. He</a>
<a id='line_503'>had never cared for Shelley, though Shelley seems to have liked him,</a>
<a id='line_504'>and, in his invalid state, he naturally shrank from being a burden to a</a>
<a id='line_505'>mere acquaintance.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>It was as they left England, off the coast of Dorsetshire, that Keats</a>
<a id='line_508'>wrote his last beautiful sonnet on a blank leaf of his folio copy of</a>
<a id='line_509'>Shakespeare, facing _A Lover's Complaint_:--</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>     Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art--</a>
<a id='line_512'>     Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,</a>
<a id='line_513'>     And watching, with eternal lids apart,</a>
<a id='line_514'>     Like Nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,</a>
<a id='line_515'>     The moving waters at their priest-like task</a>
<a id='line_516'>     Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,</a>
<a id='line_517'>     Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask</a>
<a id='line_518'>     Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--</a>
<a id='line_519'>     No--yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,</a>
<a id='line_520'>     Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,</a>
<a id='line_521'>     To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,</a>
<a id='line_522'>     Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,</a>
<a id='line_523'>     Still, still to hear her tender taken breath,</a>
<a id='line_524'>     And so live ever--or else swoon to death.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>The friends reached Rome, and there Keats, after a brief rally, rapidly</a>
<a id='line_527'>became worse. Severn nursed him with desperate devotion, and of Keats's</a>
<a id='line_528'>sweet considerateness and patience he could never say enough. Indeed</a>
<a id='line_529'>such was the force and lovableness of Keats's personality that though</a>
<a id='line_530'>Severn lived fifty-eight years longer it was for the rest of his life a</a>
<a id='line_531'>chief occupation to write and draw his memories of his friend.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>On February 23rd, 1821, came the end for which Keats had begun to long.</a>
<a id='line_534'>He died peacefully in Severn's arms. On the 26th he was buried in the</a>
<a id='line_535'>beautiful little Protestant cemetery of which Shelley said that it 'made</a>
<a id='line_536'>one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a</a>
<a id='line_537'>place'.</a>
<a id='line_538'></a>
<a id='line_539'>Great indignation was felt at the time by those who attributed his</a>
<a id='line_540'>death, in part at least, to the cruel treatment which he had received</a>
<a id='line_541'>from the critics. Shelley, in _Adonais_, withered them with his scorn,</a>
<a id='line_542'>and Byron, in _Don Juan_, had his gibe both at the poet and at his</a>
<a id='line_543'>enemies. But we know now how mistaken they were. Keats, in a normal</a>
<a id='line_544'>state of mind and body, was never unduly depressed by harsh or unfair</a>
<a id='line_545'>criticism. 'Praise or blame,' he wrote, 'has but a momentary effect on</a>
<a id='line_546'>the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic</a>
<a id='line_547'>on his own works,' and this attitude he consistently maintained</a>
<a id='line_548'>throughout his poetic career. No doubt the sense that his genius was</a>
<a id='line_549'>unappreciated added something to the torment of mind which he suffered</a>
<a id='line_550'>in Rome, and on his death-bed he asked that on his tombstone should be</a>
<a id='line_551'>inscribed the words 'Here lies one whose name was writ in water'. But it</a>
<a id='line_552'>was apparently not said in bitterness, and the rest of the</a>
<a id='line_553'>inscription[xxiii:1] expresses rather the natural anger of his friends</a>
<a id='line_554'>at the treatment he had received than the mental attitude of the poet</a>
<a id='line_555'>himself.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>Fully to understand him we must read his poetry with the commentary of</a>
<a id='line_558'>his letters which reveal in his character elements of humour,</a>
<a id='line_559'>clear-sighted wisdom, frankness, strength, sympathy and tolerance. So</a>
<a id='line_560'>doing we shall enter into the mind and heart of the friend who, speaking</a>
<a id='line_561'>for many, described Keats as one 'whose genius I did not, and do not,</a>
<a id='line_562'>more fully admire than I entirely loved the man'.</a>

<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>  Upon a time, before the faery broods</a>
<a id='line_623'>  Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,</a>
<a id='line_624'>  Before King Oberon's bright diadem,</a>
<a id='line_625'>  Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,</a>
<a id='line_626'>  Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns</a>
<a id='line_627'>  From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,</a>
<a id='line_628'>  The ever-smitten Hermes empty left</a>
<a id='line_629'>  His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft:</a>
<a id='line_630'>  From high Olympus had he stolen light,</a>
<a id='line_631'>  On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight           10</a>
<a id='line_632'>  Of his great summoner, and made retreat</a>
<a id='line_633'>  Into a forest on the shores of Crete.</a>
<a id='line_634'>  For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt</a>
<a id='line_635'>  A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;</a>
<a id='line_636'>  At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured</a>
<a id='line_637'>  Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored.</a>
<a id='line_638'>  Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,</a>
<a id='line_639'>  And in those meads where sometime she might haunt,</a>
<a id='line_640'>  Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,</a>
<a id='line_641'>  Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose.               20</a>
<a id='line_642'>  Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!</a>
<a id='line_643'>  So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat</a>
<a id='line_644'>  Burnt from his winged heels to either ear,</a>
<a id='line_645'>  That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,</a>
<a id='line_646'>  Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,</a>
<a id='line_647'>  Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.</a>
<a id='line_648'>  From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,</a>
<a id='line_649'>  Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,</a>
<a id='line_650'>  And wound with many a river to its head,</a>
<a id='line_651'>  To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed:      30</a>
<a id='line_652'>  In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,</a>
<a id='line_653'>  And so he rested, on the lonely ground,</a>
<a id='line_654'>  Pensive, and full of painful jealousies</a>
<a id='line_655'>  Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.</a>
<a id='line_656'>  There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,</a>
<a id='line_657'>  Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys</a>
<a id='line_658'>  All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake:</a>
<a id='line_659'>  "When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!</a>
<a id='line_660'>  When move in a sweet body fit for life,</a>
<a id='line_661'>  And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife                 40</a>
<a id='line_662'>  Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!"</a>
<a id='line_663'>  The God, dove-footed, glided silently</a>
<a id='line_664'>  Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,</a>
<a id='line_665'>  The taller grasses and full-flowering weed,</a>
<a id='line_666'>  Until he found a palpitating snake,</a>
<a id='line_667'>  Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'>    She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,</a>
<a id='line_670'>  Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;</a>
<a id='line_671'>  Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,</a>
<a id='line_672'>  Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;                 50</a>
<a id='line_673'>  And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,</a>
<a id='line_674'>  Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed</a>
<a id='line_675'>  Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries--</a>
<a id='line_676'>  So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries,</a>
<a id='line_677'>  She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf,</a>
<a id='line_678'>  Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.</a>
<a id='line_679'>  Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire</a>
<a id='line_680'>  Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar:</a>
<a id='line_681'>  Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!</a>
<a id='line_682'>  She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete:        60</a>
<a id='line_683'>  And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there</a>
<a id='line_684'>  But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?</a>
<a id='line_685'>  As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air.</a>
<a id='line_686'>  Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake</a>
<a id='line_687'>  Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love's sake,</a>
<a id='line_688'>  And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,</a>
<a id='line_689'>  Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>    "Fair Hermes, crown'd with feathers, fluttering light,</a>
<a id='line_692'>  I had a splendid dream of thee last night:</a>
<a id='line_693'>  I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold,                     70</a>
<a id='line_694'>  Among the Gods, upon Olympus old,</a>
<a id='line_695'>  The only sad one; for thou didst not hear</a>
<a id='line_696'>  The soft, lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear,</a>
<a id='line_697'>  Nor even Apollo when he sang alone,</a>
<a id='line_698'>  Deaf to his throbbing throat's long, long melodious moan.</a>
<a id='line_699'>  I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes,</a>
<a id='line_700'>  Break amorous through the clouds, as morning breaks,</a>
<a id='line_701'>  And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart,</a>
<a id='line_702'>  Strike for the Cretan isle; and here thou art!</a>
<a id='line_703'>  Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid?"                80</a>
<a id='line_704'>  Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd</a>
<a id='line_705'>  His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired:</a>
<a id='line_706'>  "Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent, surely high inspired!</a>
<a id='line_707'>  Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes,</a>
<a id='line_708'>  Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise,</a>
<a id='line_709'>  Telling me only where my nymph is fled,--</a>
<a id='line_710'>  Where she doth breathe!" "Bright planet, thou hast said,"</a>
<a id='line_711'>  Return'd the snake, "but seal with oaths, fair God!"</a>
<a id='line_712'>  "I swear," said Hermes, "by my serpent rod,</a>
<a id='line_713'>  And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown!"                 90</a>
<a id='line_714'>  Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms blown.</a>
<a id='line_715'>  Then thus again the brilliance feminine:</a>
<a id='line_716'>  "Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine,</a>
<a id='line_717'>  Free as the air, invisibly, she strays</a>
<a id='line_718'>  About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days</a>
<a id='line_719'>  She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet</a>
<a id='line_720'>  Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet;</a>
<a id='line_721'>  From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,</a>
<a id='line_722'>  She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen:</a>
<a id='line_723'>  And by my power is her beauty veil'd                        100</a>
<a id='line_724'>  To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd</a>
<a id='line_725'>  By the love-glances of unlovely eyes,</a>
<a id='line_726'>  Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear'd Silenus' sighs.</a>
<a id='line_727'>  Pale grew her immortality, for woe</a>
<a id='line_728'>  Of all these lovers, and she grieved so</a>
<a id='line_729'>  I took compassion on her, bade her steep</a>
<a id='line_730'>  Her hair in weird syrops, that would keep</a>
<a id='line_731'>  Her loveliness invisible, yet free</a>
<a id='line_732'>  To wander as she loves, in liberty.</a>
<a id='line_733'>  Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone,                  110</a>
<a id='line_734'>  If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon!"</a>
<a id='line_735'>  Then, once again, the charmed God began</a>
<a id='line_736'>  An oath, and through the serpent's ears it ran</a>
<a id='line_737'>  Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian.</a>
<a id='line_738'>  Ravish'd, she lifted her Circean head,</a>
<a id='line_739'>  Blush'd a live damask, and swift-lisping said,</a>
<a id='line_740'>  "I was a woman, let me have once more</a>
<a id='line_741'>  A woman's shape, and charming as before.</a>
<a id='line_742'>  I love a youth of Corinth--O the bliss!</a>
<a id='line_743'>  Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is.          120</a>
<a id='line_744'>  Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,</a>
<a id='line_745'>  And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now."</a>
<a id='line_746'>  The God on half-shut feathers sank serene,</a>
<a id='line_747'>  She breath'd upon his eyes, and swift was seen</a>
<a id='line_748'>  Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.</a>
<a id='line_749'>  It was no dream; or say a dream it was,</a>
<a id='line_750'>  Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass</a>
<a id='line_751'>  Their pleasures in a long immortal dream.</a>
<a id='line_752'>  One warm, flush'd moment, hovering, it might seem</a>
<a id='line_753'>  Dash'd by the wood-nymph's beauty, so he burn'd;            130</a>
<a id='line_754'>  Then, lighting on the printless verdure, turn'd</a>
<a id='line_755'>  To the swoon'd serpent, and with languid arm,</a>
<a id='line_756'>  Delicate, put to proof the lythe Caducean charm.</a>
<a id='line_757'>  So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent</a>
<a id='line_758'>  Full of adoring tears and blandishment,</a>
<a id='line_759'>  And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane,</a>
<a id='line_760'>  Faded before him, cower'd, nor could restrain</a>
<a id='line_761'>  Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower</a>
<a id='line_762'>  That faints into itself at evening hour:</a>
<a id='line_763'>  But the God fostering her chilled hand,                     140</a>
<a id='line_764'>  She felt the warmth, her eyelids open'd bland,</a>
<a id='line_765'>  And, like new flowers at morning song of bees,</a>
<a id='line_766'>  Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees.</a>
<a id='line_767'>  Into the green-recessed woods they flew;</a>
<a id='line_768'>  Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>    Left to herself, the serpent now began</a>
<a id='line_771'>  To change; her elfin blood in madness ran,</a>
<a id='line_772'>  Her mouth foam'd, and the grass, therewith besprent,</a>
<a id='line_773'>  Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent;</a>
<a id='line_774'>  Her eyes in torture fix'd, and anguish drear,               150</a>
<a id='line_775'>  Hot, glaz'd, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear,</a>
<a id='line_776'>  Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks, without one cooling tear.</a>
<a id='line_777'>  The colours all inflam'd throughout her train,</a>
<a id='line_778'>  She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain:</a>
<a id='line_779'>  A deep volcanian yellow took the place</a>
<a id='line_780'>  Of all her milder-mooned body's grace;</a>
<a id='line_781'>  And, as the lava ravishes the mead,</a>
<a id='line_782'>  Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede;</a>
<a id='line_783'>  Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,</a>
<a id='line_784'>  Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars:            160</a>
<a id='line_785'>  So that, in moments few, she was undrest</a>
<a id='line_786'>  Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,</a>
<a id='line_787'>  And rubious-argent: of all these bereft,</a>
<a id='line_788'>  Nothing but pain and ugliness were left.</a>
<a id='line_789'>  Still shone her crown; that vanish'd, also she</a>
<a id='line_790'>  Melted and disappear'd as suddenly;</a>
<a id='line_791'>  And in the air, her new voice luting soft,</a>
<a id='line_792'>  Cried, "Lycius! gentle Lycius!"--Borne aloft</a>
<a id='line_793'>  With the bright mists about the mountains hoar</a>
<a id='line_794'>  These words dissolv'd: Crete's forests heard no more.       170</a>
<a id='line_795'></a>
<a id='line_796'>    Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright,</a>
<a id='line_797'>  A full-born beauty new and exquisite?</a>
<a id='line_798'>  She fled into that valley they pass o'er</a>
<a id='line_799'>  Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore;</a>
<a id='line_800'>  And rested at the foot of those wild hills,</a>
<a id='line_801'>  The rugged founts of the Peræan rills,</a>
<a id='line_802'>  And of that other ridge whose barren back</a>
<a id='line_803'>  Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack,</a>
<a id='line_804'>  South-westward to Cleone. There she stood</a>
<a id='line_805'>  About a young bird's flutter from a wood,                   180</a>
<a id='line_806'>  Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread,</a>
<a id='line_807'>  By a clear pool, wherein she passioned</a>
<a id='line_808'>  To see herself escap'd from so sore ills,</a>
<a id='line_809'>  While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.</a>
<a id='line_810'></a>
<a id='line_811'>    Ah, happy Lycius!--for she was a maid</a>
<a id='line_812'>  More beautiful than ever twisted braid,</a>
<a id='line_813'>  Or sigh'd, or blush'd, or on spring-flowered lea</a>
<a id='line_814'>  Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy:</a>
<a id='line_815'>  A virgin purest lipp'd, yet in the lore</a>
<a id='line_816'>  Of love deep learned to the red heart's core:               190</a>
<a id='line_817'>  Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain</a>
<a id='line_818'>  To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;</a>
<a id='line_819'>  Define their pettish limits, and estrange</a>
<a id='line_820'>  Their points of contact, and swift counterchange;</a>
<a id='line_821'>  Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart</a>
<a id='line_822'>  Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;</a>
<a id='line_823'>  As though in Cupid's college she had spent</a>
<a id='line_824'>  Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,</a>
<a id='line_825'>  And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>    Why this fair creature chose so fairily                   200</a>
<a id='line_828'>  By the wayside to linger, we shall see;</a>
<a id='line_829'>  But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse</a>
<a id='line_830'>  And dream, when in the serpent prison-house,</a>
<a id='line_831'>  Of all she list, strange or magnificent:</a>
<a id='line_832'>  How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;</a>
<a id='line_833'>  Whether to faint Elysium, or where</a>
<a id='line_834'>  Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair</a>
<a id='line_835'>  Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair;</a>
<a id='line_836'>  Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine,</a>
<a id='line_837'>  Stretch'd out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine;           210</a>
<a id='line_838'>  Or where in Pluto's gardens palatine</a>
<a id='line_839'>  Mulciber's columns gleam in far piazzian line.</a>
<a id='line_840'>  And sometimes into cities she would send</a>
<a id='line_841'>  Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend;</a>
<a id='line_842'>  And once, while among mortals dreaming thus,</a>
<a id='line_843'>  She saw the young Corinthian Lycius</a>
<a id='line_844'>  Charioting foremost in the envious race,</a>
<a id='line_845'>  Like a young Jove with calm uneager face,</a>
<a id='line_846'>  And fell into a swooning love of him.</a>
<a id='line_847'>  Now on the moth-time of that evening dim                    220</a>
<a id='line_848'>  He would return that way, as well she knew,</a>
<a id='line_849'>  To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew</a>
<a id='line_850'>  The eastern soft wind, and his galley now</a>
<a id='line_851'>  Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow</a>
<a id='line_852'>  In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle</a>
<a id='line_853'>  Fresh anchor'd; whither he had been awhile</a>
<a id='line_854'>  To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there</a>
<a id='line_855'>  Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare.</a>
<a id='line_856'>  Jove heard his vows, and better'd his desire;</a>
<a id='line_857'>  For by some freakful chance he made retire                  230</a>
<a id='line_858'>  From his companions, and set forth to walk,</a>
<a id='line_859'>  Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:</a>
<a id='line_860'>  Over the solitary hills he fared,</a>
<a id='line_861'>  Thoughtless at first, but ere eve's star appeared</a>
<a id='line_862'>  His phantasy was lost, where reason fades,</a>
<a id='line_863'>  In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades.</a>
<a id='line_864'>  Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near--</a>
<a id='line_865'>  Close to her passing, in indifference drear,</a>
<a id='line_866'>  His silent sandals swept the mossy green;</a>
<a id='line_867'>  So neighbour'd to him, and yet so unseen                    240</a>
<a id='line_868'>  She stood: he pass'd, shut up in mysteries,</a>
<a id='line_869'>  His mind wrapp'd like his mantle, while her eyes</a>
<a id='line_870'>  Follow'd his steps, and her neck regal white</a>
<a id='line_871'>  Turn'd--syllabling thus, "Ah, Lycius bright,</a>
<a id='line_872'>  And will you leave me on the hills alone?</a>
<a id='line_873'>  Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown."</a>
<a id='line_874'>  He did; not with cold wonder fearingly,</a>
<a id='line_875'>  But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice;</a>
<a id='line_876'>  For so delicious were the words she sung,</a>
<a id='line_877'>  It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long:            250</a>
<a id='line_878'>  And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up,</a>
<a id='line_879'>  Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup,</a>
<a id='line_880'>  And still the cup was full,--while he, afraid</a>
<a id='line_881'>  Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid</a>
<a id='line_882'>  Due adoration, thus began to adore;</a>
<a id='line_883'>  Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so sure:</a>
<a id='line_884'>  "Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess, see</a>
<a id='line_885'>  Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee!</a>
<a id='line_886'>  For pity do not this sad heart belie--</a>
<a id='line_887'>  Even as thou vanishest so I shall die.                      260</a>
<a id='line_888'>  Stay! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay!</a>
<a id='line_889'>  To thy far wishes will thy streams obey:</a>
<a id='line_890'>  Stay! though the greenest woods be thy domain,</a>
<a id='line_891'>  Alone they can drink up the morning rain:</a>
<a id='line_892'>  Though a descended Pleiad, will not one</a>
<a id='line_893'>  Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune</a>
<a id='line_894'>  Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine?</a>
<a id='line_895'>  So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine</a>
<a id='line_896'>  Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst fade</a>
<a id='line_897'>  Thy memory will waste me to a shade:--                      270</a>
<a id='line_898'>  For pity do not melt!"--"If I should stay,"</a>
<a id='line_899'>  Said Lamia, "here, upon this floor of clay,</a>
<a id='line_900'>  And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough,</a>
<a id='line_901'>  What canst thou say or do of charm enough</a>
<a id='line_902'>  To dull the nice remembrance of my home?</a>
<a id='line_903'>  Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam</a>
<a id='line_904'>  Over these hills and vales, where no joy is,--</a>
<a id='line_905'>  Empty of immortality and bliss!</a>
<a id='line_906'>  Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know</a>
<a id='line_907'>  That finer spirits cannot breathe below                     280</a>
<a id='line_908'>  In human climes, and live: Alas! poor youth,</a>
<a id='line_909'>  What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe</a>
<a id='line_910'>  My essence? What serener palaces,</a>
<a id='line_911'>  Where I may all my many senses please,</a>
<a id='line_912'>  And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease?</a>
<a id='line_913'>  It cannot be--Adieu!" So said, she rose</a>
<a id='line_914'>  Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose</a>
<a id='line_915'>  The amorous promise of her lone complain,</a>
<a id='line_916'>  Swoon'd, murmuring of love, and pale with pain.</a>
<a id='line_917'>  The cruel lady, without any show                            290</a>
<a id='line_918'>  Of sorrow for her tender favourite's woe,</a>
<a id='line_919'>  But rather, if her eyes could brighter be,</a>
<a id='line_920'>  With brighter eyes and slow amenity,</a>
<a id='line_921'>  Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh</a>
<a id='line_922'>  The life she had so tangled in her mesh:</a>
<a id='line_923'>  And as he from one trance was wakening</a>
<a id='line_924'>  Into another, she began to sing,</a>
<a id='line_925'>  Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,</a>
<a id='line_926'>  A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres,</a>
<a id='line_927'>  While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting</a>
<a id='line_928'>      fires.                                                  300</a>
<a id='line_929'>  And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone,</a>
<a id='line_930'>  As those who, safe together met alone</a>
<a id='line_931'>  For the first time through many anguish'd days,</a>
<a id='line_932'>  Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise</a>
<a id='line_933'>  His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,</a>
<a id='line_934'>  For that she was a woman, and without</a>
<a id='line_935'>  Any more subtle fluid in her veins</a>
<a id='line_936'>  Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains</a>
<a id='line_937'>  Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his.</a>
<a id='line_938'>  And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss               310</a>
<a id='line_939'>  Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said,</a>
<a id='line_940'>  She dwelt but half retir'd, and there had led</a>
<a id='line_941'>  Days happy as the gold coin could invent</a>
<a id='line_942'>  Without the aid of love; yet in content</a>
<a id='line_943'>  Till she saw him, as once she pass'd him by,</a>
<a id='line_944'>  Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully</a>
<a id='line_945'>  At Venus' temple porch, 'mid baskets heap'd</a>
<a id='line_946'>  Of amorous herbs and flowers, newly reap'd</a>
<a id='line_947'>  Late on that eve, as 'twas the night before</a>
<a id='line_948'>  The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more,                 320</a>
<a id='line_949'>  But wept alone those days, for why should she adore?</a>
<a id='line_950'>  Lycius from death awoke into amaze,</a>
<a id='line_951'>  To see her still, and singing so sweet lays;</a>
<a id='line_952'>  Then from amaze into delight he fell</a>
<a id='line_953'>  To hear her whisper woman's lore so well;</a>
<a id='line_954'>  And every word she spake entic'd him on</a>
<a id='line_955'>  To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known.</a>
<a id='line_956'>  Let the mad poets say whate'er they please</a>
<a id='line_957'>  Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses,</a>
<a id='line_958'>  There is not such a treat among them all,                   330</a>
<a id='line_959'>  Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,</a>
<a id='line_960'>  As a real woman, lineal indeed</a>
<a id='line_961'>  From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.</a>
<a id='line_962'>  Thus gentle Lamia judg'd, and judg'd aright,</a>
<a id='line_963'>  That Lycius could not love in half a fright,</a>
<a id='line_964'>  So threw the goddess off, and won his heart</a>
<a id='line_965'>  More pleasantly by playing woman's part,</a>
<a id='line_966'>  With no more awe than what her beauty gave,</a>
<a id='line_967'>  That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save.</a>
<a id='line_968'>  Lycius to all made eloquent reply,                          340</a>
<a id='line_969'>  Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh;</a>
<a id='line_970'>  And last, pointing to Corinth, ask'd her sweet,</a>
<a id='line_971'>  If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet.</a>
<a id='line_972'>  The way was short, for Lamia's eagerness</a>
<a id='line_973'>  Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease</a>
<a id='line_974'>  To a few paces; not at all surmised</a>
<a id='line_975'>  By blinded Lycius, so in her comprized.</a>
<a id='line_976'>  They pass'd the city gates, he knew not how,</a>
<a id='line_977'>  So noiseless, and he never thought to know.</a>
<a id='line_978'></a>
<a id='line_979'>    As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all,                   350</a>
<a id='line_980'>  Throughout her palaces imperial,</a>
<a id='line_981'>  And all her populous streets and temples lewd,</a>
<a id='line_982'>  Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd,</a>
<a id='line_983'>  To the wide-spreaded night above her towers.</a>
<a id='line_984'>  Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours,</a>
<a id='line_985'>  Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white,</a>
<a id='line_986'>  Companion'd or alone; while many a light</a>
<a id='line_987'>  Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals,</a>
<a id='line_988'>  And threw their moving shadows on the walls,</a>
<a id='line_989'>  Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade               360</a>
<a id='line_990'>  Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonnade.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>    Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,</a>
<a id='line_993'>  Her fingers he press'd hard, as one came near</a>
<a id='line_994'>  With curl'd gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald crown,</a>
<a id='line_995'>  Slow-stepp'd, and robed in philosophic gown:</a>
<a id='line_996'>  Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past,</a>
<a id='line_997'>  Into his mantle, adding wings to haste,</a>
<a id='line_998'>  While hurried Lamia trembled: "Ah," said he,</a>
<a id='line_999'>  "Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully?</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew?"--               370</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  "I'm wearied," said fair Lamia: "tell me who</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  His features:--Lycius! wherefore did you blind</a>
<a id='line_1004'>  Yourself from his quick eyes?" Lycius replied,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  "'Tis Apollonius sage, my trusty guide</a>
<a id='line_1006'>  And good instructor; but to-night he seems</a>
<a id='line_1007'>  The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams."</a>
<a id='line_1008'></a>
<a id='line_1009'>    While yet he spake they had arrived before</a>
<a id='line_1010'>  A pillar'd porch, with lofty portal door,</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow               380</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  Reflected in the slabbed steps below,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>  Mild as a star in water; for so new,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>  And so unsullied was the marble hue,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>  So through the crystal polish, liquid fine,</a>
<a id='line_1016'>  Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  Could e'er have touch'd there. Sounds Æolian</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  Breath'd from the hinges, as the ample span</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown</a>
<a id='line_1020'>  Some time to any, but those two alone,</a>
<a id='line_1021'>  And a few Persian mutes, who that same year                 390</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  Were seen about the markets: none knew where</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  They could inhabit; the most curious</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  Were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house:</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  And but the flitter-winged verse must tell,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  For truth's sake, what woe afterwards befel,</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>  Shut from the busy world of more incredulous.</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>PART II.</a>
<a id='line_1032'></a>
<a id='line_1033'>  Love in a hut, with water and a crust,</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  Is--Love, forgive us!--cinders, ashes, dust;</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  Love in a palace is perhaps at last</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  More grievous torment than a hermit's fast:--</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  That is a doubtful tale from faery land,</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  Hard for the non-elect to understand.</a>
<a id='line_1039'>  Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down,</a>
<a id='line_1040'>  He might have given the moral a fresh frown,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  Or clench'd it quite: but too short was their bliss</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss.   10</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare</a>
<a id='line_1044'>  Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  Hover'd and buzz'd his wings, with fearful roar,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  Above the lintel of their chamber door,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.</a>
<a id='line_1048'></a>
<a id='line_1049'>    For all this came a ruin: side by side</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  They were enthroned, in the even tide,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  Upon a couch, near to a curtaining</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  Whose airy texture, from a golden string,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  Floated into the room, and let appear                        20</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  Unveil'd the summer heaven, blue and clear,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  Betwixt two marble shafts:--there they reposed,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  Saving a tythe which love still open kept,</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  That they might see each other while they almost slept;</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  When from the slope side of a suburb hill,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  Deafening the swallow's twitter, came a thrill</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  Of trumpets--Lycius started--the sounds fled,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  But left a thought, a buzzing in his head.</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  For the first time, since first he harbour'd in              30</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  That purple-lined palace of sweet sin,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  Into the noisy world almost forsworn.</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  The lady, ever watchful, penetrant,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  Saw this with pain, so arguing a want</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  Of something more, more than her empery</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  Of joys; and she began to moan and sigh</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  Because he mused beyond her, knowing well</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  That but a moment's thought is passion's passing bell.</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  "Why do you sigh, fair creature?" whisper'd he:              40</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  "Why do you think?" return'd she tenderly:</a>
<a id='line_1075'>  "You have deserted me;--where am I now?</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow:</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  No, no, you have dismiss'd me; and I go</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so."</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  He answer'd, bending to her open eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  Where he was mirror'd small in paradise,</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  "My silver planet, both of eve and morn!</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  While I am striving how to fill my heart                     50</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  With deeper crimson, and a double smart?</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  How to entangle, trammel up and snare</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  Ay, a sweet kiss--you see your mighty woes.</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  My thoughts! shall I unveil them? Listen then!</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  What mortal hath a prize, that other men</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  May be confounded and abash'd withal,</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice                     60</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice.</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  While through the thronged streets your bridal car</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  Wheels round its dazzling spokes."--The lady's cheek</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  Trembled; she nothing said, but, pale and meek,</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  Of sorrows at his words; at last with pain</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  To change his purpose. He thereat was stung,</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim                     70</a>
<a id='line_1104'>  Her wild and timid nature to his aim:</a>
<a id='line_1105'>  Besides, for all his love, in self despite,</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  Against his better self, he took delight</a>
<a id='line_1107'>  Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new.</a>
<a id='line_1108'>  His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue</a>
<a id='line_1109'>  Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible</a>
<a id='line_1110'>  In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.</a>
<a id='line_1111'>  Fine was the mitigated fury, like</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  Apollo's presence when in act to strike</a>
<a id='line_1113'>  The serpent--Ha, the serpent! certes, she                    80</a>
<a id='line_1114'>  Was none. She burnt, she lov'd the tyranny,</a>
<a id='line_1115'>  And, all subdued, consented to the hour</a>
<a id='line_1116'>  When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  "Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my truth,</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  I have not ask'd it, ever thinking thee</a>
<a id='line_1120'>  Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>  As still I do. Hast any mortal name,</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  Fit appellation for this dazzling frame?</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth,                  90</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth?"</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  "I have no friends," said Lamia, "no, not one;</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  My presence in wide Corinth hardly known:</a>
<a id='line_1127'>  My parents' bones are in their dusty urns</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>  Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me,</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  And I neglect the holy rite for thee.</a>
<a id='line_1131'>  Even as you list invite your many guests;</a>
<a id='line_1132'>  But if, as now it seems, your vision rests</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  With any pleasure on me, do not bid                         100</a>
<a id='line_1134'>  Old Apollonius--from him keep me hid."</a>
<a id='line_1135'>  Lycius, perplex'd at words so blind and blank,</a>
<a id='line_1136'>  Made close inquiry; from whose touch she shrank,</a>
<a id='line_1137'>  Feigning a sleep; and he to the dull shade</a>
<a id='line_1138'>  Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>    It was the custom then to bring away</a>
<a id='line_1141'>  The bride from home at blushing shut of day,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>  Veil'd, in a chariot, heralded along</a>
<a id='line_1143'>  By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song,</a>
<a id='line_1144'>  With other pageants: but this fair unknown                  110</a>
<a id='line_1145'>  Had not a friend. So being left alone,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  (Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)</a>
<a id='line_1147'>  And knowing surely she could never win</a>
<a id='line_1148'>  His foolish heart from its mad pompousness,</a>
<a id='line_1149'>  She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress</a>
<a id='line_1150'>  The misery in fit magnificence.</a>
<a id='line_1151'>  She did so, but 'tis doubtful how and whence</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  Came, and who were her subtle servitors.</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  About the halls, and to and from the doors,</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  There was a noise of wings, till in short space             120</a>
<a id='line_1155'>  The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace.</a>
<a id='line_1156'>  A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone</a>
<a id='line_1157'>  Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan</a>
<a id='line_1158'>  Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade.</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  Of palm and plantain, met from either side,</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  High in the midst, in honour of the bride:</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  Two palms and then two plantains, and so on,</a>
<a id='line_1163'>  From either side their stems branch'd one to one</a>
<a id='line_1164'>  All down the aisled place; and beneath all                  130</a>
<a id='line_1165'>  There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall.</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  So canopied, lay an untasted feast</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest,</a>
<a id='line_1168'>  Silently paced about, and as she went,</a>
<a id='line_1169'>  In pale contented sort of discontent,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>  Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich</a>
<a id='line_1171'>  The fretted splendour of each nook and niche.</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first,</a>
<a id='line_1173'>  Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees,                   140</a>
<a id='line_1175'>  And with the larger wove in small intricacies.</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  Approving all, she faded at self-will,</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  And shut the chamber up, close, hush'd and still,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  Complete and ready for the revels rude,</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.</a>
<a id='line_1180'></a>
<a id='line_1181'>    The day appear'd, and all the gossip rout.</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  O senseless Lycius! Madman! wherefore flout</a>
<a id='line_1183'>  The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister'd hours,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>  And show to common eyes these secret bowers?</a>
<a id='line_1185'>  The herd approach'd; each guest, with busy brain,           150</a>
<a id='line_1186'>  Arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain,</a>

<a id='line_1188'>  Remember'd it from childhood all complete</a>
<a id='line_1189'>  Without a gap, yet ne'er before had seen</a>
<a id='line_1190'>  That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne;</a>
<a id='line_1191'>  So in they hurried all, maz'd, curious and keen:</a>
<a id='line_1192'>  Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,</a>
<a id='line_1193'>  And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere;</a>
<a id='line_1194'>  'Twas Apollonius: something too he laugh'd,</a>
<a id='line_1195'>  As though some knotty problem, that had daft                160</a>
<a id='line_1196'>  His patient thought, had now begun to thaw,</a>
<a id='line_1197'>  And solve and melt:--'twas just as he foresaw.</a>
<a id='line_1198'></a>
<a id='line_1199'>    He met within the murmurous vestibule</a>
<a id='line_1200'>  His young disciple. "'Tis no common rule,</a>

<a id='line_1203'>  With an unbidden presence the bright throng</a>
<a id='line_1204'>  Of younger friends; yet must I do this wrong,</a>
<a id='line_1205'>  And you forgive me." Lycius blush'd, and led</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  The old man through the inner doors broad-spread;           170</a>
<a id='line_1207'>  With reconciling words and courteous mien</a>
<a id='line_1208'>  Turning into sweet milk the sophist's spleen.</a>
<a id='line_1209'></a>
<a id='line_1210'>    Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room,</a>
<a id='line_1211'>  Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume:</a>
<a id='line_1212'>  Before each lucid pannel fuming stood</a>
<a id='line_1213'>  A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood,</a>
<a id='line_1214'>  Each by a sacred tripod held aloft,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>  Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft</a>
<a id='line_1216'>  Wool-woofed carpets: fifty wreaths of smoke</a>
<a id='line_1217'>  From fifty censers their light voyage took                  180</a>
<a id='line_1218'>  To the high roof, still mimick'd as they rose</a>
<a id='line_1219'>  Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous.</a>
<a id='line_1220'>  Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats insphered,</a>
<a id='line_1221'>  High as the level of a man's breast rear'd</a>
<a id='line_1222'>  On libbard's paws, upheld the heavy gold</a>
<a id='line_1223'>  Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told</a>
<a id='line_1224'>  Of Ceres' horn, and, in huge vessels, wine</a>
<a id='line_1225'>  Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine.</a>
<a id='line_1226'>  Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood,</a>
<a id='line_1227'>  Each shrining in the midst the image of a God.              190</a>

<a id='line_1233'>  Pour'd on his hair, they all mov'd to the feast</a>
<a id='line_1234'>  In white robes, and themselves in order placed</a>

<a id='line_1236'>  Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>

<a id='line_1243'>  Louder they talk, and louder come the strains</a>

<a id='line_1245'>  The space, the splendour of the draperies,</a>
<a id='line_1246'>  The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer,</a>
<a id='line_1247'>  Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear,</a>

<a id='line_1249'>  And every soul from human trammels freed,                   210</a>
<a id='line_1250'>  No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine,</a>

<a id='line_1279'></a>
<a id='line_1280'>    By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place,</a>
<a id='line_1281'>  Scarce saw in all the room another face,                    240</a>
<a id='line_1282'>  Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took</a>
<a id='line_1283'>  Full brimm'd, and opposite sent forth a look</a>
<a id='line_1284'>  'Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance</a>

<a id='line_1287'>  Had fix'd his eye, without a twinkle or stir</a>
<a id='line_1288'>  Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride,</a>
<a id='line_1289'>  Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet pride.</a>
<a id='line_1290'>  Lycius then press'd her hand, with devout touch,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>  As pale it lay upon the rosy couch:                         250</a>
<a id='line_1292'>  'Twas icy, and the cold ran through his veins;</a>
<a id='line_1293'>  Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart.</a>
<a id='line_1295'>  "Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start?</a>
<a id='line_1296'>  Know'st thou that man?" Poor Lamia answer'd not.</a>
<a id='line_1297'>  He gaz'd into her eyes, and not a jot</a>
<a id='line_1298'>  Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal:</a>
<a id='line_1299'>  More, more he gaz'd: his human senses reel:</a>
<a id='line_1300'>  Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs;</a>
<a id='line_1301'>  There was no recognition in those orbs.                     260</a>
<a id='line_1302'>  "Lamia!" he cried--and no soft-toned reply.</a>
<a id='line_1303'>  The many heard, and the loud revelry</a>

<a id='line_1305'>  The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths.</a>
<a id='line_1306'>  By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased;</a>
<a id='line_1307'>  A deadly silence step by step increased,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>  Until it seem'd a horrid presence there,</a>
<a id='line_1309'>  And not a man but felt the terror in his hair.</a>
<a id='line_1310'>  "Lamia!" he shriek'd; and nothing but the shriek</a>
<a id='line_1311'>  With its sad echo did the silence break.                    270</a>
<a id='line_1312'>  "Begone, foul dream!" he cried, gazing again</a>
<a id='line_1313'>  In the bride's face, where now no azure vein</a>
<a id='line_1314'>  Wander'd on fair-spaced temples; no soft bloom</a>
<a id='line_1315'>  Misted the cheek; no passion to illume</a>
<a id='line_1316'>  The deep-recessed vision:--all was blight;</a>
<a id='line_1317'>  Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white.</a>
<a id='line_1318'>  "Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man!</a>

<a id='line_1331'>  My sweet bride withers at their potency."                   290</a>
<a id='line_1332'>  "Fool!" said the sophist, in an under-tone</a>
<a id='line_1333'>  Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan</a>
<a id='line_1334'>  From Lycius answer'd, as heart-struck and lost,</a>
<a id='line_1335'>  He sank supine beside the aching ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1336'>  "Fool! Fool!" repeated he, while his eyes still</a>
<a id='line_1337'>  Relented not, nor mov'd; "from every ill</a>
<a id='line_1338'>  Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day,</a>
<a id='line_1339'>  And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?"</a>
<a id='line_1340'>  Then Lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye,</a>
<a id='line_1341'>  Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly,               300</a>
<a id='line_1342'>  Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well</a>
<a id='line_1343'>  As her weak hand could any meaning tell,</a>
<a id='line_1344'>  Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so,</a>
<a id='line_1345'>  He look'd and look'd again a level--No!</a>
<a id='line_1346'>  "A Serpent!" echoed he; no sooner said,</a>
<a id='line_1347'>  Than with a frightful scream she vanished:</a>
<a id='line_1348'>  And Lycius' arms were empty of delight,</a>
<a id='line_1349'>  As were his limbs of life, from that same night.</a>
<a id='line_1350'>  On the high couch he lay!--his friends came round--</a>
<a id='line_1351'>  Supported him--no pulse, or breath they found,              310</a>

<a id='line_3238'>  Not so much life as on a summer's day</a>
<a id='line_3239'>  Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,</a>
<a id='line_3240'>  But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.             10</a>
<a id='line_3241'>  A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more</a>
<a id='line_3242'>  By reason of his fallen divinity</a>
<a id='line_3243'>  Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds</a>
<a id='line_3244'>  Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.</a>
<a id='line_3245'></a>
<a id='line_3246'>    Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,</a>
<a id='line_3247'>  No further than to where his feet had stray'd,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>  And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground</a>
<a id='line_3249'>  His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,</a>

<a id='line_3252'>  His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.</a>
<a id='line_3253'></a>
<a id='line_3254'>    It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;</a>
<a id='line_3255'>  But there came one, who with a kindred hand</a>
<a id='line_3256'>  Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low</a>
<a id='line_3257'>  With reverence, though to one who knew it not.</a>
<a id='line_3258'>  She was a Goddess of the infant world;</a>
<a id='line_3259'>  By her in stature the tall Amazon</a>
<a id='line_3260'>  Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en</a>

<a id='line_3263'>  Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,</a>
<a id='line_3264'>  Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>  When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.</a>
<a id='line_3266'>  But oh! how unlike marble was that face:</a>
<a id='line_3267'>  How beautiful, if sorrow had not made</a>
<a id='line_3268'>  Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.</a>
<a id='line_3269'>  There was a listening fear in her regard,</a>
<a id='line_3270'>  As if calamity had but begun;</a>
<a id='line_3271'>  As if the vanward clouds of evil days</a>
<a id='line_3272'>  Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear                  40</a>
<a id='line_3273'>  Was with its stored thunder labouring up.</a>
<a id='line_3274'>  One hand she press'd upon that aching spot</a>
<a id='line_3275'>  Where beats the human heart, as if just there,</a>
<a id='line_3276'>  Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:</a>
<a id='line_3277'>  The other upon Saturn's bended neck</a>
<a id='line_3278'>  She laid, and to the level of his ear</a>
<a id='line_3279'>  Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake</a>
<a id='line_3280'>  In solemn tenour and deep organ tone:</a>
<a id='line_3281'>  Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue</a>
<a id='line_3282'>  Would come in these like accents; O how frail                50</a>
<a id='line_3283'>  To that large utterance of the early Gods!</a>
<a id='line_3284'>  "Saturn, look up!--though wherefore, poor old King?</a>
<a id='line_3285'>  I have no comfort for thee, no not one:</a>
<a id='line_3286'>  I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'</a>

<a id='line_3289'>  And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,</a>
<a id='line_3290'>  Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air</a>
<a id='line_3291'>  Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.</a>
<a id='line_3292'>  Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,                   60</a>
<a id='line_3293'>  Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;</a>
<a id='line_3294'>  And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands</a>
<a id='line_3295'>  Scorches and burns our once serene domain.</a>
<a id='line_3296'>  O aching time! O moments big as years!</a>
<a id='line_3297'>  All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>  And press it so upon our weary griefs</a>
<a id='line_3299'>  That unbelief has not a space to breathe.</a>
<a id='line_3300'>  Saturn, sleep on:--O thoughtless, why did I</a>
<a id='line_3301'>  Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?</a>
<a id='line_3302'>  Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?                        70</a>
<a id='line_3303'>  Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."</a>
<a id='line_3304'></a>
<a id='line_3305'>    As when, upon a tranced summer-night,</a>
<a id='line_3306'>  Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,</a>
<a id='line_3307'>  Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,</a>
<a id='line_3308'>  Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,</a>
<a id='line_3309'>  Save from one gradual solitary gust</a>
<a id='line_3310'>  Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,</a>
<a id='line_3311'>  As if the ebbing air had but one wave;</a>
<a id='line_3312'>  So came these words and went; the while in tears</a>
<a id='line_3313'>  She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,           80</a>
<a id='line_3314'>  Just where her falling hair might be outspread</a>
<a id='line_3315'>  A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.</a>
<a id='line_3316'>  One moon, with alteration slow, had shed</a>
<a id='line_3317'>  Her silver seasons four upon the night,</a>
<a id='line_3318'>  And still these two were postured motionless,</a>

<a id='line_3320'>  The frozen God still couchant on the earth,</a>
<a id='line_3321'>  And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:</a>
<a id='line_3322'>  Until at length old Saturn lifted up</a>
<a id='line_3323'>  His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,                    90</a>
<a id='line_3324'>  And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,</a>
<a id='line_3325'>  And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,</a>
<a id='line_3326'>  As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard</a>
<a id='line_3327'>  Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:</a>
<a id='line_3328'>  "O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,</a>
<a id='line_3329'>  Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;</a>
<a id='line_3330'>  Look up, and let me see our doom in it;</a>
<a id='line_3331'>  Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape</a>
<a id='line_3332'>  Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice</a>
<a id='line_3333'>  Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,                 100</a>
<a id='line_3334'>  Naked and bare of its great diadem,</a>
<a id='line_3335'>  Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power</a>
<a id='line_3336'>  To make me desolate? whence came the strength?</a>
<a id='line_3337'>  How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,</a>
<a id='line_3338'>  While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?</a>
<a id='line_3339'>  But it is so; and I am smother'd up,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>  And buried from all godlike exercise</a>
<a id='line_3341'>  Of influence benign on planets pale,</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  Of admonitions to the winds and seas,</a>
<a id='line_3343'>  Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,                    110</a>
<a id='line_3344'>  And all those acts which Deity supreme</a>
<a id='line_3345'>  Doth ease its heart of love in.--I am gone</a>
<a id='line_3346'>  Away from my own bosom: I have left</a>
<a id='line_3347'>  My strong identity, my real self,</a>
<a id='line_3348'>  Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit</a>
<a id='line_3349'>  Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!</a>
<a id='line_3350'>  Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round</a>
<a id='line_3351'>  Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;</a>
<a id='line_3352'>  Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;</a>
<a id='line_3353'>  Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.--                 120</a>
<a id='line_3354'>  Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest</a>
<a id='line_3355'>  A certain shape or shadow, making way</a>
<a id='line_3356'>  With wings or chariot fierce to repossess</a>
<a id='line_3357'>  A heaven he lost erewhile: it must--it must</a>
<a id='line_3358'>  Be of ripe progress--Saturn must be King.</a>
<a id='line_3359'>  Yes, there must be a golden victory;</a>
<a id='line_3360'>  There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown</a>
<a id='line_3361'>  Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival</a>
<a id='line_3362'>  Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,</a>
<a id='line_3363'>  Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir                    130</a>
<a id='line_3364'>  Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be</a>
<a id='line_3365'>  Beautiful things made new, for the surprise</a>
<a id='line_3366'>  Of the sky-children; I will give command:</a>
<a id='line_3367'>  Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"</a>
<a id='line_3368'></a>
<a id='line_3369'>    This passion lifted him upon his feet,</a>
<a id='line_3370'>  And made his hands to struggle in the air,</a>
<a id='line_3371'>  His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,</a>
<a id='line_3372'>  His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.</a>
<a id='line_3373'>  He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;</a>
<a id='line_3374'>  A little time, and then again he snatch'd                   140</a>
<a id='line_3375'>  Utterance thus.--"But cannot I create?</a>
<a id='line_3376'>  Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth</a>
<a id='line_3377'>  Another world, another universe,</a>
<a id='line_3378'>  To overbear and crumble this to nought?</a>
<a id='line_3379'>  Where is another chaos? Where?"--That word</a>
<a id='line_3380'>  Found way unto Olympus, and made quake</a>
<a id='line_3381'>  The rebel three.--Thea was startled up,</a>
<a id='line_3382'>  And in her bearing was a sort of hope,</a>
<a id='line_3383'>  As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.</a>
<a id='line_3384'></a>
<a id='line_3385'>    "This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,       150</a>
<a id='line_3386'>  O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;</a>
<a id='line_3387'>  I know the covert, for thence came I hither."</a>
<a id='line_3388'>  Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went</a>
<a id='line_3389'>  With backward footing through the shade a space:</a>
<a id='line_3390'>  He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way</a>
<a id='line_3391'>  Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist</a>
<a id='line_3392'>  Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.</a>
<a id='line_3393'></a>
<a id='line_3394'>    Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,</a>
<a id='line_3395'>  More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,</a>
<a id='line_3396'>  Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:                160</a>
<a id='line_3397'>  The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>  Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,</a>
<a id='line_3399'>  And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.</a>
<a id='line_3400'>  But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept</a>
<a id='line_3401'>  His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;--</a>
<a id='line_3402'>  Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire</a>
<a id='line_3403'>  Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up</a>
<a id='line_3404'>  From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure:</a>
<a id='line_3405'>  For as among us mortals omens drear</a>
<a id='line_3406'>  Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he--                  170</a>
<a id='line_3407'>  Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,</a>
<a id='line_3408'>  Or the familiar visiting of one</a>
<a id='line_3409'>  Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,</a>
<a id='line_3410'>  Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;</a>
<a id='line_3411'>  But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,</a>
<a id='line_3412'>  Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright</a>
<a id='line_3413'>  Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,</a>
<a id='line_3414'>  And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,</a>
<a id='line_3415'>  Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>  Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;                     180</a>
<a id='line_3417'>  And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds</a>
<a id='line_3418'>  Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings,</a>
<a id='line_3419'>  Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,</a>
<a id='line_3420'>  Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard,</a>
<a id='line_3421'>  Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.</a>
<a id='line_3422'>  Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths</a>
<a id='line_3423'>  Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,</a>
<a id='line_3424'>  Instead of sweets, his ample palate took</a>
<a id='line_3425'>  Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick:</a>
<a id='line_3426'>  And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west,                  190</a>
<a id='line_3427'>  After the full completion of fair day,--</a>
<a id='line_3428'>  For rest divine upon exalted couch</a>
<a id='line_3429'>  And slumber in the arms of melody,</a>
<a id='line_3430'>  He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease</a>
<a id='line_3431'>  With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;</a>
<a id='line_3432'>  While far within each aisle and deep recess,</a>
<a id='line_3433'>  His winged minions in close clusters stood,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>  Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men</a>
<a id='line_3435'>  Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,</a>
<a id='line_3436'>  When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.          200</a>
<a id='line_3437'>  Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,</a>
<a id='line_3438'>  Went step for step with Thea through the woods,</a>
<a id='line_3439'>  Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,</a>
<a id='line_3440'>  Came slope upon the threshold of the west;</a>
<a id='line_3441'>  Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope</a>
<a id='line_3442'>  In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,</a>
<a id='line_3443'>  Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet</a>
<a id='line_3444'>  And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;</a>
<a id='line_3445'>  And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,</a>
<a id='line_3446'>  In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,                 210</a>
<a id='line_3447'>  That inlet to severe magnificence</a>
<a id='line_3448'>  Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.</a>
<a id='line_3449'></a>
<a id='line_3450'>    He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;</a>
<a id='line_3451'>  His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,</a>
<a id='line_3452'>  And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,</a>
<a id='line_3453'>  That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours</a>
<a id='line_3454'>  And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,</a>
<a id='line_3455'>  From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,</a>
<a id='line_3456'>  Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,</a>
<a id='line_3457'>  And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,                    220</a>
<a id='line_3458'>  Until he reach'd the great main cupola;</a>
<a id='line_3459'>  There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,</a>
<a id='line_3460'>  And from the basements deep to the high towers</a>
<a id='line_3461'>  Jarr'd his own golden region; and before</a>
<a id='line_3462'>  The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,</a>
<a id='line_3463'>  His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,</a>
<a id='line_3464'>  To this result: "O dreams of day and night!</a>
<a id='line_3465'>  O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!</a>
<a id='line_3466'>  O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!</a>
<a id='line_3467'>  O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools!                230</a>
<a id='line_3468'>  Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why</a>
<a id='line_3469'>  Is my eternal essence thus distraught</a>
<a id='line_3470'>  To see and to behold these horrors new?</a>
<a id='line_3471'>  Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?</a>
<a id='line_3472'>  Am I to leave this haven of my rest,</a>
<a id='line_3473'>  This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,</a>
<a id='line_3474'>  This calm luxuriance of blissful light,</a>
<a id='line_3475'>  These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,</a>
<a id='line_3476'>  Of all my lucent empire? It is left</a>
<a id='line_3477'>  Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.                      240</a>
<a id='line_3478'>  The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,</a>
<a id='line_3479'>  I cannot see--but darkness, death and darkness.</a>
<a id='line_3480'>  Even here, into my centre of repose,</a>
<a id='line_3481'>  The shady visions come to domineer,</a>
<a id='line_3482'>  Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.--</a>
<a id='line_3483'>  Fall!--No, by Tellus and her briny robes!</a>
<a id='line_3484'>  Over the fiery frontier of my realms</a>
<a id='line_3485'>  I will advance a terrible right arm</a>
<a id='line_3486'>  Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,</a>
<a id='line_3487'>  And bid old Saturn take his throne again."--                250</a>
<a id='line_3488'>  He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat</a>
<a id='line_3489'>  Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;</a>
<a id='line_3490'>  For as in theatres of crowded men</a>
<a id='line_3491'>  Hubbub increases more they call out "Hush!"</a>
<a id='line_3492'>  So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale</a>
<a id='line_3493'>  Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;</a>
<a id='line_3494'>  And from the mirror'd level where he stood</a>
<a id='line_3495'>  A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.</a>
<a id='line_3496'>  At this, through all his bulk an agony</a>
<a id='line_3497'>  Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,                260</a>
<a id='line_3498'>  Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular</a>
<a id='line_3499'>  Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd</a>
<a id='line_3500'>  From over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled</a>
<a id='line_3501'>  To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours</a>
<a id='line_3502'>  Before the dawn in season due should blush,</a>
<a id='line_3503'>  He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,</a>
<a id='line_3504'>  Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide</a>
<a id='line_3505'>  Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.</a>
<a id='line_3506'>  The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode</a>
<a id='line_3507'>  Each day from east to west the heavens through,             270</a>
<a id='line_3508'>  Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;</a>
<a id='line_3509'>  Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,</a>
<a id='line_3510'>  But ever and anon the glancing spheres,</a>
<a id='line_3511'>  Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,</a>
<a id='line_3512'>  Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark</a>
<a id='line_3513'>  Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep</a>
<a id='line_3514'>  Up to the zenith,--hieroglyphics old,</a>
<a id='line_3515'>  Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers</a>
<a id='line_3516'>  Then living on the earth, with labouring thought</a>
<a id='line_3517'>  Won from the gaze of many centuries:                        280</a>
<a id='line_3518'>  Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge</a>
<a id='line_3519'>  Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone,</a>
<a id='line_3520'>  Their wisdom long since fled.--Two wings this orb</a>
<a id='line_3521'>  Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,</a>
<a id='line_3522'>  Ever exalted at the God's approach:</a>
<a id='line_3523'>  And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense</a>
<a id='line_3524'>  Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;</a>
<a id='line_3525'>  While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,</a>
<a id='line_3526'>  Awaiting for Hyperion's command.</a>
<a id='line_3527'>  Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne              290</a>
<a id='line_3528'>  And bid the day begin, if but for change.</a>
<a id='line_3529'>  He might not:--No, though a primeval God:</a>
<a id='line_3530'>  The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.</a>
<a id='line_3531'>  Therefore the operations of the dawn</a>
<a id='line_3532'>  Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.</a>
<a id='line_3533'>  Those silver wings expanded sisterly,</a>
<a id='line_3534'>  Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide</a>
<a id='line_3535'>  Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night</a>
<a id='line_3536'>  And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,</a>
<a id='line_3537'>  Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent                     300</a>
<a id='line_3538'>  His spirit to the sorrow of the time;</a>
<a id='line_3539'>  And all along a dismal rack of clouds,</a>
<a id='line_3540'>  Upon the boundaries of day and night,</a>
<a id='line_3541'>  He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.</a>
<a id='line_3542'>  There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars</a>
<a id='line_3543'>  Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice</a>
<a id='line_3544'>  Of Coelus, from the universal space,</a>

<a id='line_3568'>  Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:</a>
<a id='line_3569'>  Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;</a>
<a id='line_3570'>  Actions of rage and passion; even as</a>
<a id='line_3571'>  I see them, on the mortal world beneath,</a>
<a id='line_3572'>  In men who die.--This is the grief, O Son!</a>
<a id='line_3573'>  Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!</a>
<a id='line_3574'>  Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,</a>
<a id='line_3575'>  As thou canst move about, an evident God;</a>
<a id='line_3576'>  And canst oppose to each malignant hour</a>
<a id='line_3577'>  Ethereal presence:--I am but a voice;                       340</a>
<a id='line_3578'>  My life is but the life of winds and tides,</a>
<a id='line_3579'>  No more than winds and tides can I avail:--</a>

<a id='line_3607'>  Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.</a>
<a id='line_3608'>  Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd            10</a>

<a id='line_3616'>  Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.</a>
<a id='line_3617'>  Coeus, and Gyges, and Briareüs,</a>
<a id='line_3618'>  Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,                           20</a>
<a id='line_3619'>  With many more, the brawniest in assault,</a>
<a id='line_3620'>  Were pent in regions of laborious breath;</a>
<a id='line_3621'>  Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep</a>
<a id='line_3622'>  Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs</a>
<a id='line_3623'>  Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;</a>
<a id='line_3624'>  Without a motion, save of their big hearts</a>
<a id='line_3625'>  Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd</a>
<a id='line_3626'>  With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.</a>
<a id='line_3627'>  Mnemosyne was straying in the world;</a>
<a id='line_3628'>  Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;                       30</a>
<a id='line_3629'>  And many else were free to roam abroad,</a>
<a id='line_3630'>  But for the main, here found they covert drear.</a>
<a id='line_3631'>  Scarce images of life, one here, one there,</a>
<a id='line_3632'>  Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque</a>
<a id='line_3633'>  Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,</a>
<a id='line_3634'>  When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,</a>
<a id='line_3635'>  In dull November, and their chancel vault,</a>
<a id='line_3636'>  The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.</a>
<a id='line_3637'>  Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave</a>
<a id='line_3638'>  Or word, or look, or action of despair.                      40</a>
<a id='line_3639'>  Creüs was one; his ponderous iron mace</a>
<a id='line_3640'>  Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock</a>
<a id='line_3641'>  Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.</a>
<a id='line_3642'>  Iäpetus another; in his grasp,</a>
<a id='line_3643'>  A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue</a>
<a id='line_3644'>  Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length</a>
<a id='line_3645'>  Dead; and because the creature could not spit</a>
<a id='line_3646'>  Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.</a>
<a id='line_3647'>  Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,</a>
<a id='line_3648'>  As though in pain; for still upon the flint                  50</a>
<a id='line_3649'>  He ground severe his skull, with open mouth</a>
<a id='line_3650'>  And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him</a>
<a id='line_3651'>  Asia, born of most enormous Caf,</a>
<a id='line_3652'>  Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,</a>
<a id='line_3653'>  Though feminine, than any of her sons:</a>
<a id='line_3654'>  More thought than woe was in her dusky face,</a>
<a id='line_3655'>  For she was prophesying of her glory;</a>
<a id='line_3656'>  And in her wide imagination stood</a>
<a id='line_3657'>  Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,</a>
<a id='line_3658'>  By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.                          60</a>
<a id='line_3659'>  Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,</a>
<a id='line_3660'>  So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk</a>
<a id='line_3661'>  Shed from the broadest of her elephants.</a>
<a id='line_3662'>  Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,</a>
<a id='line_3663'>  Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,</a>
<a id='line_3664'>  Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild</a>
<a id='line_3665'>  As grazing ox unworried in the meads;</a>
<a id='line_3666'>  Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,</a>
<a id='line_3667'>  He meditated, plotted, and even now</a>
<a id='line_3668'>  Was hurling mountains in that second war,                    70</a>
<a id='line_3669'>  Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods</a>
<a id='line_3670'>  To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.</a>
<a id='line_3671'>  Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone</a>
<a id='line_3672'>  Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour'd close</a>
<a id='line_3673'>  Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap</a>
<a id='line_3674'>  Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.</a>
<a id='line_3675'>  In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet</a>
<a id='line_3676'>  Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;</a>
<a id='line_3677'>  No shape distinguishable, more than when</a>
<a id='line_3678'>  Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:         80</a>
<a id='line_3679'>  And many else whose names may not be told.</a>
<a id='line_3680'>  For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,</a>
<a id='line_3681'>  Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt</a>
<a id='line_3682'>  Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd</a>
<a id='line_3683'>  With damp and slippery footing from a depth</a>
<a id='line_3684'>  More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff</a>
<a id='line_3685'>  Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew</a>
<a id='line_3686'>  Till on the level height their steps found ease:</a>
<a id='line_3687'>  Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms</a>
<a id='line_3688'>  Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,                     90</a>
<a id='line_3689'>  And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:</a>
<a id='line_3690'>  There saw she direst strife; the supreme God</a>
<a id='line_3691'>  At war with all the frailty of grief,</a>
<a id='line_3692'>  Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,</a>
<a id='line_3693'>  Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.</a>
<a id='line_3694'>  Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate</a>
<a id='line_3695'>  Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,</a>
<a id='line_3696'>  A disanointing poison: so that Thea,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>  Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass</a>
<a id='line_3698'>  First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.                   100</a>
<a id='line_3699'></a>
<a id='line_3700'>    As with us mortal men, the laden heart</a>
<a id='line_3701'>  Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,</a>
<a id='line_3702'>  When it is nighing to the mournful house</a>
<a id='line_3703'>  Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;</a>
<a id='line_3704'>  So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,</a>
<a id='line_3705'>  Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,</a>
<a id='line_3706'>  But that he met Enceladus's eye,</a>
<a id='line_3707'>  Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once</a>
<a id='line_3708'>  Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,</a>
<a id='line_3709'>  "Titans, behold your God!" at which some groan'd;           110</a>
<a id='line_3710'>  Some started on their feet; some also shouted;</a>
<a id='line_3711'>  Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;</a>
<a id='line_3712'>  And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,</a>
<a id='line_3713'>  Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,</a>
<a id='line_3714'>  Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3715'>  There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines</a>
<a id='line_3716'>  When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise</a>
<a id='line_3717'>  Among immortals when a God gives sign,</a>
<a id='line_3718'>  With hushing finger, how he means to load</a>
<a id='line_3719'>  His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,       120</a>
<a id='line_3720'>  With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:</a>
<a id='line_3721'>  Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;</a>
<a id='line_3722'>  Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,</a>
<a id='line_3723'>  No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,</a>
<a id='line_3724'>  Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom</a>
<a id='line_3725'>  Grew up like organ, that begins anew</a>
<a id='line_3726'>  Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,</a>
<a id='line_3727'>  Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.</a>
<a id='line_3728'>  Thus grew it up--"Not in my own sad breast,</a>
<a id='line_3729'>  Which is its own great judge and searcher out,              130</a>
<a id='line_3730'>  Can I find reason why ye should be thus:</a>
<a id='line_3731'>  Not in the legends of the first of days,</a>
<a id='line_3732'>  Studied from that old spirit-leaved book</a>
<a id='line_3733'>  Which starry Uranus with finger bright</a>
<a id='line_3734'>  Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves</a>
<a id='line_3735'>  Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;--</a>
<a id='line_3736'>  And the which book ye know I ever kept</a>
<a id='line_3737'>  For my firm-based footstool:--Ah, infirm!</a>
<a id='line_3738'>  Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent</a>
<a id='line_3739'>  Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,--                  140</a>
<a id='line_3740'>  At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling</a>
<a id='line_3741'>  One against one, or two, or three, or all</a>
<a id='line_3742'>  Each several one against the other three,</a>
<a id='line_3743'>  As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods</a>
<a id='line_3744'>  Drown both, and press them both against earth's face,</a>
<a id='line_3745'>  Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath</a>
<a id='line_3746'>  Unhinges the poor world;--not in that strife,</a>
<a id='line_3747'>  Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,</a>
<a id='line_3748'>  Can I find reason why ye should be thus:</a>
<a id='line_3749'>  No, no-where can unriddle, though I search,                 150</a>
<a id='line_3750'>  And pore on Nature's universal scroll</a>
<a id='line_3751'>  Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>  The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,</a>
<a id='line_3753'>  Should cower beneath what, in comparison,</a>
<a id='line_3754'>  Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,</a>
<a id='line_3755'>  O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!</a>
<a id='line_3756'>  O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'--Ye groan:</a>
<a id='line_3757'>  Shall I say 'Crouch!'--Ye groan. What can I then?</a>
<a id='line_3758'>  O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!</a>
<a id='line_3759'>  What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,                  160</a>
<a id='line_3760'>  How we can war, how engine our great wrath!</a>
<a id='line_3761'>  O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear</a>
<a id='line_3762'>  Is all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,</a>
<a id='line_3763'>  Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face</a>
<a id='line_3764'>  I see, astonied, that severe content</a>
<a id='line_3765'>  Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"</a>
<a id='line_3766'></a>
<a id='line_3767'>    So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea,</a>
<a id='line_3768'>  Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,</a>
<a id='line_3769'>  But cogitation in his watery shades,</a>
<a id='line_3770'>  Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,                      170</a>
<a id='line_3771'>  In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue</a>
<a id='line_3772'>  Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.</a>
<a id='line_3773'>  "O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,</a>
<a id='line_3774'>  Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!</a>
<a id='line_3775'>  Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,</a>
<a id='line_3776'>  My voice is not a bellows unto ire.</a>
<a id='line_3777'>  Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof</a>
<a id='line_3778'>  How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:</a>
<a id='line_3779'>  And in the proof much comfort will I give,</a>
<a id='line_3780'>  If ye will take that comfort in its truth.                  180</a>
<a id='line_3781'>  We fall by course of Nature's law, not force</a>
<a id='line_3782'>  Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou</a>
<a id='line_3783'>  Hast sifted well the atom-universe;</a>
<a id='line_3784'>  But for this reason, that thou art the King,</a>
<a id='line_3785'>  And only blind from sheer supremacy,</a>
<a id='line_3786'>  One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3787'>  Through which I wandered to eternal truth.</a>
<a id='line_3788'>  And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,</a>
<a id='line_3789'>  So art thou not the last; it cannot be:</a>
<a id='line_3790'>  Thou art not the beginning nor the end.                     190</a>
<a id='line_3791'>  From chaos and parental darkness came</a>
<a id='line_3792'>  Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,</a>
<a id='line_3793'>  That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends</a>
<a id='line_3794'>  Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,</a>
<a id='line_3795'>  And with it light, and light, engendering</a>
<a id='line_3796'>  Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd</a>
<a id='line_3797'>  The whole enormous matter into life.</a>
<a id='line_3798'>  Upon that very hour, our parentage,</a>
<a id='line_3799'>  The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:</a>
<a id='line_3800'>  Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race,                200</a>
<a id='line_3801'>  Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.</a>
<a id='line_3802'>  Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;</a>
<a id='line_3803'>  O folly! for to bear all naked truths,</a>
<a id='line_3804'>  And to envisage circumstance, all calm,</a>
<a id='line_3805'>  That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!</a>
<a id='line_3806'>  As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far</a>
<a id='line_3807'>  Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;</a>
<a id='line_3808'>  And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth</a>
<a id='line_3809'>  In form and shape compact and beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_3810'>  In will, in action free, companionship,                     210</a>
<a id='line_3811'>  And thousand other signs of purer life;</a>
<a id='line_3812'>  So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,</a>
<a id='line_3813'>  A power more strong in beauty, born of us</a>
<a id='line_3814'>  And fated to excel us, as we pass</a>
<a id='line_3815'>  In glory that old Darkness: nor are we</a>
<a id='line_3816'>  Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule</a>
<a id='line_3817'>  Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil</a>
<a id='line_3818'>  Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,</a>
<a id='line_3819'>  And feedeth still, more comely than itself?</a>
<a id='line_3820'>  Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?                   220</a>
<a id='line_3821'>  Or shall the tree be envious of the dove</a>
<a id='line_3822'>  Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings</a>
<a id='line_3823'>  To wander wherewithal and find its joys?</a>
<a id='line_3824'>  We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs</a>
<a id='line_3825'>  Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,</a>
<a id='line_3826'>  But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower</a>
<a id='line_3827'>  Above us in their beauty, and must reign</a>
<a id='line_3828'>  In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law</a>
<a id='line_3829'>  That first in beauty should be first in might:</a>
<a id='line_3830'>  Yea, by that law, another race may drive                    230</a>
<a id='line_3831'>  Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.</a>
<a id='line_3832'>  Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,</a>
<a id='line_3833'>  My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?</a>
<a id='line_3834'>  Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along</a>
<a id='line_3835'>  By noble winged creatures he hath made?</a>
<a id='line_3836'>  I saw him on the calmed waters scud,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>  With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3838'>  That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell</a>
<a id='line_3839'>  To all my empire: farewell sad I took,</a>
<a id='line_3840'>  And hither came, to see how dolorous fate                   240</a>
<a id='line_3841'>  Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best</a>
<a id='line_3842'>  Give consolation in this woe extreme.</a>
<a id='line_3843'>  Receive the truth, and let it be your balm."</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>    Whether through poz'd conviction, or disdain,</a>
<a id='line_3846'>  They guarded silence, when Oceanus</a>
<a id='line_3847'>  Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?</a>
<a id='line_3848'>  But so it was, none answer'd for a space,</a>
<a id='line_3849'>  Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;</a>
<a id='line_3850'>  And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,</a>
<a id='line_3851'>  With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,                 250</a>
<a id='line_3852'>  Thus wording timidly among the fierce:</a>
<a id='line_3853'>  "O Father, I am here the simplest voice,</a>
<a id='line_3854'>  And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,</a>
<a id='line_3855'>  And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,</a>
<a id='line_3856'>  There to remain for ever, as I fear:</a>
<a id='line_3857'>  I would not bode of evil, if I thought</a>
<a id='line_3858'>  So weak a creature could turn off the help</a>
<a id='line_3859'>  Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;</a>
<a id='line_3860'>  Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell</a>
<a id='line_3861'>  Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,                   260</a>
<a id='line_3862'>  And know that we had parted from all hope.</a>
<a id='line_3863'>  I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,</a>
<a id='line_3864'>  Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land</a>
<a id='line_3865'>  Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.</a>
<a id='line_3866'>  Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;</a>
<a id='line_3867'>  Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;</a>
<a id='line_3868'>  So that I felt a movement in my heart</a>
<a id='line_3869'>  To chide, and to reproach that solitude</a>
<a id='line_3870'>  With songs of misery, music of our woes;</a>
<a id='line_3871'>  And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell                   270</a>
<a id='line_3872'>  And murmur'd into it, and made melody--</a>
<a id='line_3873'>  O melody no more! for while I sang,</a>
<a id='line_3874'>  And with poor skill let pass into the breeze</a>
<a id='line_3875'>  The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand</a>
<a id='line_3876'>  Just opposite, an island of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_3877'>  There came enchantment with the shifting wind,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>  That did both drown and keep alive my ears.</a>
<a id='line_3879'>  I threw my shell away upon the sand,</a>
<a id='line_3880'>  And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd</a>
<a id='line_3881'>  With that new blissful golden melody.                       280</a>
<a id='line_3882'>  A living death was in each gush of sounds,</a>
<a id='line_3883'>  Each family of rapturous hurried notes,</a>
<a id='line_3884'>  That fell, one after one, yet all at once,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>  Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:</a>
<a id='line_3886'>  And then another, then another strain,</a>
<a id='line_3887'>  Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,</a>
<a id='line_3888'>  With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,</a>
<a id='line_3889'>  To hover round my head, and make me sick</a>
<a id='line_3890'>  Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,</a>
<a id='line_3891'>  And I was stopping up my frantic ears,                      290</a>
<a id='line_3892'>  When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,</a>
<a id='line_3893'>  A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,</a>
<a id='line_3894'>  And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!</a>
<a id='line_3895'>  The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'</a>
<a id='line_3896'>  I fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!'</a>

<a id='line_3901'></a>
<a id='line_3902'>    So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook           300</a>
<a id='line_3903'>  That, lingering along a pebbled coast,</a>
<a id='line_3904'>  Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,</a>
<a id='line_3905'>  And shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice</a>
<a id='line_3906'>  Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:</a>
<a id='line_3907'>  The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves</a>
<a id='line_3908'>  In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,</a>
<a id='line_3909'>  Came booming thus, while still upon his arm</a>
<a id='line_3910'>  He lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.</a>
<a id='line_3911'>  "Or shall we listen to the over-wise,</a>
<a id='line_3912'>  Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?                         310</a>
<a id='line_3913'>  Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all</a>

<a id='line_3927'>  He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,</a>
<a id='line_3928'>  Still without intermission speaking thus:</a>
<a id='line_3929'>  "Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,</a>
<a id='line_3930'>  And purge the ether of our enemies;</a>
<a id='line_3931'>  How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,</a>

<a id='line_3940'>  Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak:--</a>
<a id='line_3941'>  That was before our brows were taught to frown,</a>
<a id='line_3942'>  Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;                340</a>

<a id='line_3952'>  A pallid gleam across his features stern:</a>
<a id='line_3953'>  Not savage, for he saw full many a God                      350</a>
<a id='line_3954'>  Wroth as himself. He look'd upon them all,</a>
<a id='line_3955'>  And in each face he saw a gleam of light,</a>
<a id='line_3956'>  But splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks</a>
<a id='line_3957'>  Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel</a>
<a id='line_3958'>  When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.</a>
<a id='line_3959'>  In pale and silver silence they remain'd,</a>
<a id='line_3960'>  Till suddenly a splendour, like the morn,</a>
<a id='line_3961'>  Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,</a>
<a id='line_3962'>  All the sad spaces of oblivion,</a>
<a id='line_3963'>  And every gulf, and every chasm old,                        360</a>

<a id='line_3969'>  Now saw the light and made it terrible.</a>
<a id='line_3970'>  It was Hyperion:--a granite peak</a>

<a id='line_4046'>  Which he with eager guess began to read</a>

<a id='line_4155'></a>
<a id='line_4156'>INTRODUCTION TO LAMIA.</a>
<a id='line_4157'></a>
<a id='line_4158'>_Lamia_, like _Endymion_, is written in the heroic couplet, but the</a>
<a id='line_4159'>difference in style is very marked. The influence of Dryden's</a>
<a id='line_4160'>narrative-poems (his translations from Boccaccio and Chaucer) is clearly</a>
<a id='line_4161'>traceable in the metre, style, and construction of the later poem. Like</a>
<a id='line_4162'>Dryden, Keats now makes frequent use of the Alexandrine, or 6-foot line,</a>
<a id='line_4163'>and of the triplet. He has also restrained the exuberance of his</a>
<a id='line_4164'>language and gained force, whilst in imaginative power and felicity of</a>
<a id='line_4165'>diction he surpasses anything of which Dryden was capable. The flaws in</a>
<a id='line_4166'>his style are mainly due to carelessness in the rimes and some</a>
<a id='line_4167'>questionable coining of words. He also occasionally lapses into the</a>
<a id='line_4168'>vulgarity and triviality which marred certain of his early poems.</a>
<a id='line_4169'></a>
<a id='line_4170'>The best he gained from his study of Dryden's _Fables_, a debt perhaps</a>
<a id='line_4171'>to Chaucer rather than to Dryden, was a notable advance in constructive</a>
<a id='line_4172'>power. In _Lamia_ he shows a very much greater sense of proportion and</a>
<a id='line_4173'>power of selection than in his earlier work. There is, as it were, more</a>
<a id='line_4174'>light and shade.</a>
<a id='line_4175'></a>
<a id='line_4176'>Thus we find that whenever the occasion demands it his style rises to</a>
<a id='line_4177'>supreme force and beauty. The metamorphosis of the serpent, the entry</a>
<a id='line_4178'>of Lamia and Lycius into Corinth, the building by Lamia of the Fairy</a>
<a id='line_4179'>Hall, and her final withering under the eye of Apollonius--these are the</a>
<a id='line_4180'>most important points in the story, and the passages in which they are</a>
<a id='line_4181'>described are also the most striking in the poem.</a>
<a id='line_4182'></a>
<a id='line_4183'>The allegorical meaning of the story seems to be, that it is fatal to</a>
<a id='line_4184'>attempt to separate the sensuous and emotional life from the life of</a>
<a id='line_4185'>reason. Philosophy alone is cold and destructive, but the pleasures of</a>
<a id='line_4186'>the senses alone are unreal and unsatisfying. The man who attempts such</a>
<a id='line_4187'>a divorce between the two parts of his nature will fail miserably as did</a>
<a id='line_4188'>Lycius, who, unable permanently to exclude reason, was compelled to face</a>
<a id='line_4189'>the death of his illusions, and could not, himself, survive them.</a>
<a id='line_4190'></a>
<a id='line_4191'>Of the poem Keats himself says, writing to his brother in September,</a>
<a id='line_4192'>1819: 'I have been reading over a part of a short poem I have composed</a>
<a id='line_4193'>lately, called _Lamia_, and I am certain there is that sort of fire in</a>
<a id='line_4194'>it that must take hold of people some way; give them either pleasant or</a>
<a id='line_4195'>unpleasant sensation--what they want is a sensation of some sort.' But</a>
<a id='line_4196'>to the greatest of Keats's critics, Charles Lamb, the poem appealed</a>
<a id='line_4197'>somewhat differently, for he writes, 'More exuberantly rich in imagery</a>
<a id='line_4198'>and painting [than _Isabella_] is the story of _Lamia_. It is of as</a>
<a id='line_4199'>gorgeous stuff as ever romance was composed of,' and, after enumerating</a>
<a id='line_4200'>the most striking pictures in the poem, he adds, '[these] are all that</a>
<a id='line_4201'>fairy-land can do for us.' _Lamia_ struck his imagination, but his heart</a>
<a id='line_4202'>was given to _Isabella_.</a>

<a id='line_4499'>INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA AND THE EVE OF ST. AGNES</a>
<a id='line_4500'></a>
<a id='line_4501'>In _Lamia_ and _Hyperion_, as in _Endymion_, we find Keats inspired by</a>
<a id='line_4502'>classic story, though the inspiration in each case came to him through</a>
<a id='line_4503'>Elizabethan writers. Here, on the other hand, mediaeval legend is his</a>
<a id='line_4504'>inspiration; the 'faery broods' have driven 'nymph and satyr from the</a>
<a id='line_4505'>prosperous woods'. Akin to the Greeks as he was in spirit, in his</a>
<a id='line_4506'>instinctive personification of the lovely manifestations of nature, his</a>
<a id='line_4507'>style and method were really more naturally suited to the portrayal of</a>
<a id='line_4508'>mediaeval scenes, where he found the richness and warmth of colour in</a>
<a id='line_4509'>which his soul delighted.</a>
<a id='line_4510'></a>
<a id='line_4511'>The story of _Isabella_ he took from Boccaccio, an Italian writer of the</a>
<a id='line_4512'>fourteenth century, whose _Decameron_, a collection of one hundred</a>
<a id='line_4513'>stories, has been a store-house of plots for English writers. By</a>
<a id='line_4514'>Boccaccio the tale is very shortly and simply told, being evidently</a>
<a id='line_4515'>interesting to him mainly for its plot. Keats was attracted to it not so</a>
<a id='line_4516'>much by the action as by the passion involved, so that his enlargement</a>
<a id='line_4517'>of it means little elaboration of incident, but very much more dwelling</a>
<a id='line_4518'>on the psychological aspect. That is to say, he does not care so much</a>
<a id='line_4519'>what happens, as what the personages of the poem think and feel.</a>
<a id='line_4520'></a>
<a id='line_4521'>Thus we see that the main incident of the story, the murder of Lorenzo,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>is passed over in a line--'Thus was Lorenzo slain and buried in,' the</a>
<a id='line_4523'>next line, 'There, in that forest, did his great love cease,' bringing</a>
<a id='line_4524'>us back at once from the physical reality of the murder to the thought</a>
<a id='line_4525'>of his love, which is to Keats the central fact of the story.</a>
<a id='line_4526'></a>
<a id='line_4527'>In the delineation of Isabella, her first tender passion of love, her</a>
<a id='line_4528'>agony of apprehension giving way to dull despair, her sudden wakening to</a>
<a id='line_4529'>a brief period of frenzied action, described in stanzas of incomparable</a>
<a id='line_4530'>dramatic force, and the 'peace' which followed when she</a>
<a id='line_4531'></a>
<a id='line_4532'>     Forgot the stars, the moon, the sun,</a>
<a id='line_4533'>     And she forgot the blue above the trees,</a>
<a id='line_4534'>     And she forgot the dells where waters run,</a>
<a id='line_4535'>     And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;</a>
<a id='line_4536'>     She had no knowledge when the day was done,</a>
<a id='line_4537'>     And the new morn she saw not--</a>
<a id='line_4538'></a>
<a id='line_4539'>culminating in the piteous death 'too lone and incomplete'--in the</a>
<a id='line_4540'>delineation of all this Keats shows supreme power and insight.</a>
<a id='line_4541'></a>
<a id='line_4542'>In the conception, too, of the tragic loneliness of Lorenzo's ghost we</a>
<a id='line_4543'>feel that nothing could be changed, added, or taken away.</a>
<a id='line_4544'></a>
<a id='line_4545'>Not quite equally happy are the descriptions of the cruel brothers, and</a>
<a id='line_4546'>of Lorenzo as the young lover. There is a tendency to exaggerate both</a>
<a id='line_4547'>their inhumanity and his gentleness, for purposes of contrast, which</a>
<a id='line_4548'>weakens where it would give strength.</a>
<a id='line_4549'></a>
<a id='line_4550'>_The Eve of St. Agnes_, founded on a popular mediaeval legend, not being</a>
<a id='line_4551'>a tragedy like _Isabella_, cannot be expected to rival it in depth and</a>
<a id='line_4552'>intensity; but in every other poetic quality it equals, where it does</a>
<a id='line_4553'>not surpass, the former poem.</a>
<a id='line_4554'></a>
<a id='line_4555'>To be specially noted is the skilful use which Keats here makes of</a>
<a id='line_4556'>contrast--between the cruel cold without and the warm love within; the</a>
<a id='line_4557'>palsied age of the Bedesman and Angela, and the eager youth of Porphyro</a>
<a id='line_4558'>and Madeline; the noise and revel and the hush of Madeline's bedroom,</a>
<a id='line_4559'>and, as Mr. Colvin has pointed out, in the moonlight which, chill and</a>
<a id='line_4560'>sepulchral when it strikes elsewhere, to Madeline is as a halo of glory,</a>
<a id='line_4561'>an angelic light.</a>
<a id='line_4562'></a>
<a id='line_4563'>A mysterious charm is given to the poem by the way in which Keats endows</a>
<a id='line_4564'>inanimate things with a sort of half-conscious life. The knights and</a>
<a id='line_4565'>ladies of stone arouse the bedesman's shuddering sympathy when he thinks</a>
<a id='line_4566'>of the cold they must be enduring; 'the carven angels' '_star'd_'</a>
<a id='line_4567'>'_eager-eyed_' from the roof of the chapel, and the scutcheon in</a>
<a id='line_4568'>Madeline's window '_blush'd_ with blood of queens and kings'.</a>
<a id='line_4569'></a>
<a id='line_4570'>Keats's characteristic method of description--the way in which, by his</a>
<a id='line_4571'>masterly choice of significant detail, he gives us the whole feeling of</a>
<a id='line_4572'>the situation, is here seen in its perfection. In stanza 1 each line is</a>
<a id='line_4573'>a picture and each picture contributes to the whole effect of painful</a>
<a id='line_4574'>chill. The silence of the sheep, the old man's breath visible in the</a>
<a id='line_4575'>frosty air,--these are things which many people would not notice, but it</a>
<a id='line_4576'>is such little things that make the whole scene real to us.</a>
<a id='line_4577'></a>
<a id='line_4578'>There is another method of description, quite as beautiful in its way,</a>
<a id='line_4579'>which Coleridge adopted with magic effect in _Christabel_. This is to</a>
<a id='line_4580'>use the power of suggestion, to say very little, but that little of a</a>
<a id='line_4581'>kind to awaken the reader's imagination and make him complete the</a>
<a id='line_4582'>picture. For example, we are told of Christabel--</a>
<a id='line_4583'></a>
<a id='line_4584'>     Her gentle limbs did she undress</a>
<a id='line_4585'>     And lay down in her loveliness.</a>
<a id='line_4586'></a>
<a id='line_4587'>Compare this with stanza xxvi of _The Eve of St. Agnes_.</a>
<a id='line_4588'></a>
<a id='line_4589'>That Keats was a master of both ways of obtaining a romantic effect is</a>
<a id='line_4590'>shown by his _La Belle Dame Sans Merci_, considered by some people his</a>
<a id='line_4591'>masterpiece, where the rich detail of _The Eve of St. Agnes_ is replaced</a>
<a id='line_4592'>by reserve and suggestion.</a>
<a id='line_4593'></a>

<a id='line_4990'>See Introduction to _Isabella_ and _The Eve of St. Agnes_, p. 212.</a>
<a id='line_4991'></a>
<a id='line_4992'>St. Agnes was a martyr of the Christian Church who was beheaded just</a>
<a id='line_4993'>outside Rome in 304 because she refused to marry a Pagan, holding</a>
<a id='line_4994'>herself to be a bride of Christ. She was only 13--so small and slender</a>
<a id='line_4995'>that the smallest fetters they could find slipped over her little wrists</a>
<a id='line_4996'>and fell to the ground. But they stripped, tortured, and killed her. A</a>
<a id='line_4997'>week after her death her parents dreamed that they saw her in glory with</a>
<a id='line_4998'>a white lamb, the sign of purity, beside her. Hence she is always</a>
<a id='line_4999'>pictured with lambs (as her name signifies), and to the place of her</a>
<a id='line_5000'>martyrdom two lambs are yearly taken on the anniversary and blessed.</a>
<a id='line_5001'>Then their wool is cut off and woven by the nuns into the archbishop's</a>
<a id='line_5002'>cloak, or pallium (see l. 70).</a>

<a id='line_5197'>MELANCHOLY, AND TO AUTUMN.</a>
<a id='line_5198'></a>
<a id='line_5199'>These four odes, which were all written in 1819, the first three in the</a>
<a id='line_5200'>early months of that year, ought to be considered together, since the</a>
<a id='line_5201'>same strain of thought runs through them all and, taken all together,</a>
<a id='line_5202'>they seem to sum up Keats's philosophy.</a>
<a id='line_5203'></a>
<a id='line_5204'>In all of them the poet looks upon life as it is, and the eternal</a>
<a id='line_5205'>principle of beauty, in the first three seeing them in sharp contrast;</a>
<a id='line_5206'>in the last reconciling them, and leaving us content.</a>
<a id='line_5207'></a>
<a id='line_5208'>The first-written of the four, the _Ode to a Nightingale_, is the most</a>
<a id='line_5209'>passionately human and personal of them all. For Keats wrote it soon</a>
<a id='line_5210'>after the death of his brother Tom, whom he had loved devotedly and</a>
<a id='line_5211'>himself nursed to the end. He was feeling keenly the tragedy of a world</a>
<a id='line_5212'>'where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies', and the song of</a>
<a id='line_5213'>the nightingale, heard in a friend's garden at Hampstead, made him long</a>
<a id='line_5214'>to escape with it from this world of realities and sorrows to the world</a>
<a id='line_5215'>of ideal beauty, which it seemed to him somehow to stand for and</a>
<a id='line_5216'>suggest. He did not think of the nightingale as an individual bird, but</a>
<a id='line_5217'>of its song, which had been beautiful for centuries and would continue</a>
<a id='line_5218'>to be beautiful long after his generation had passed away; and the</a>
<a id='line_5219'>thought of this undying loveliness he contrasted bitterly with our</a>
<a id='line_5220'>feverishly sad and short life. When, by the power of imagination, he had</a>
<a id='line_5221'>left the world behind him and was absorbed in the vision of beauty</a>
<a id='line_5222'>roused by the bird's song, he longed for death rather than a return to</a>
<a id='line_5223'>disillusionment.</a>
<a id='line_5224'></a>
<a id='line_5225'>So in the _Grecian Urn_ he contrasts unsatisfying human life with art,</a>
<a id='line_5226'>which is everlastingly beautiful. The figures on the vase lack one thing</a>
<a id='line_5227'>only--reality,--whilst on the other hand they are happy in not being</a>
<a id='line_5228'>subject to trouble, change, or death. The thought is sad, yet Keats</a>
<a id='line_5229'>closes this ode triumphantly, not, as in _The Nightingale_, on a note of</a>
<a id='line_5230'>disappointment. The beauty of this Greek sculpture, truly felt, teaches</a>
<a id='line_5231'>us that beauty at any rate is real and lasting, and that utter belief in</a>
<a id='line_5232'>beauty is the one thing needful in life.</a>
<a id='line_5233'></a>
<a id='line_5234'>In the _Ode on Melancholy_ Keats, in a more bitter mood, finds the</a>
<a id='line_5235'>presence, in a fleeting world, of eternal beauty the source of the</a>
<a id='line_5236'>deepest melancholy. To encourage your melancholy mood, he tells us, do</a>
<a id='line_5237'>not look on the things counted sad, but on the most beautiful, which are</a>
<a id='line_5238'>only quickly-fading manifestations of the everlasting principle of</a>
<a id='line_5239'>beauty. It is then, when a man most deeply loves the beautiful, when he</a>
<a id='line_5240'>uses his capacities of joy to the utmost, that the full bitterness of</a>
<a id='line_5241'>the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and</a>
<a id='line_5242'>crushes him. If he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much; if</a>
<a id='line_5243'>he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long.</a>
<a id='line_5244'></a>
<a id='line_5245'>But in the ode _To Autumn_ Keats attains to the serenity he has been</a>
<a id='line_5246'>seeking. In this unparalleled description of a richly beautiful autumn</a>
<a id='line_5247'>day he conveys to us all the peace and comfort which his spirit</a>
<a id='line_5248'>receives. He does not philosophize upon the spectacle or draw a moral</a>
<a id='line_5249'>from it, but he shows us how in nature beauty is ever present. To the</a>
<a id='line_5250'>momentary regret for spring he replies with praise of the present hour,</a>
<a id='line_5251'>concluding with an exquisite description of the sounds of autumn--its</a>
<a id='line_5252'>music, as beautiful as that of spring. Hitherto he has lamented the</a>
<a id='line_5253'>insecurity of a man's hold upon the beautiful, though he has never</a>
<a id='line_5254'>doubted the reality of beauty and the worth of its worship to man. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5255'>under the influence of nature, he intuitively knows that beauty once</a>
<a id='line_5256'>seen and grasped is man's possession for ever. He is in much the same</a>
<a id='line_5257'>position that Wordsworth was when he declared that</a>
<a id='line_5258'></a>
<a id='line_5259'>                    Nature never did betray</a>
<a id='line_5260'>     The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,</a>
<a id='line_5261'>     Through all the years of this our life, to lead</a>
<a id='line_5262'>     From joy to joy: for she can so inform</a>
<a id='line_5263'>     The mind that is within us, so impress</a>
<a id='line_5264'>     With quietness and beauty, and so feed</a>
<a id='line_5265'>     With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,</a>
<a id='line_5266'>     Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,</a>
<a id='line_5267'>     Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all</a>
<a id='line_5268'>     The dreary intercourse of daily life,</a>
<a id='line_5269'>     Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb</a>
<a id='line_5270'>     Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold</a>
<a id='line_5271'>     Is full of blessings.</a>
<a id='line_5272'></a>
<a id='line_5273'>This was not the last poem that Keats wrote, but it was the last which</a>
<a id='line_5274'>he wrote in the fulness of his powers. We can scarcely help wishing</a>
<a id='line_5275'>that, beautiful as were some of the productions of his last feverish</a>
<a id='line_5276'>year of life, this perfect ode, expressing so serene and untroubled a</a>
<a id='line_5277'>mood, might have been his last word to the world.</a>

<a id='line_5280'>NOTES ON THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE.</a>
<a id='line_5281'></a>
<a id='line_5282'>In the early months of 1819 Keats was living with his friend Brown at</a>
<a id='line_5283'>Hampstead (Wentworth Place). In April a nightingale built her nest in</a>
<a id='line_5284'>the garden, and Brown writes: 'Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy</a>
<a id='line_5285'>in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table</a>
<a id='line_5286'>to the grass-plot under a plum, where he sat for two or three hours.</a>
<a id='line_5287'>When he came into the house I perceived he had some scraps of paper in</a>
<a id='line_5288'>his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On</a>
<a id='line_5289'>inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his</a>
<a id='line_5290'>poetic feeling on the song of our nightingale. The writing was not well</a>
<a id='line_5291'>legible, and it was difficult to arrange the stanza on so many scraps.</a>
<a id='line_5292'>With his assistance I succeeded, and this was his _Ode to a</a>

<a id='line_5410'></a>
<a id='line_5411'>In one of his long journal-letters to his brother George, Keats writes,</a>
<a id='line_5412'>at the beginning of May, 1819: 'The following poem--the last I have</a>
<a id='line_5413'>written--is the first and the only one with which I have taken even</a>
<a id='line_5414'>moderate pains. I have for the most part dashed off my lines in a hurry.</a>
<a id='line_5415'>This I have done leisurely--I think it reads the more richly for it, and</a>
<a id='line_5416'>will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable</a>
<a id='line_5417'>and healthy spirit. You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a</a>
<a id='line_5418'>goddess before the time of Apuleius the Platonist, who lived after the</a>
<a id='line_5419'>Augustan age, and consequently the goddess was never worshipped or</a>
<a id='line_5420'>sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour, and perhaps never thought</a>
<a id='line_5421'>of in the old religion--I am more orthodox than to let a heathen goddess</a>
<a id='line_5422'>be so neglected.' _The Ode to Psyche_ follows.</a>

<a id='line_5431'>     in an unhappy moment lost him by her own fault, and wandering</a>
<a id='line_5432'>     through the world suffered many evils at the hands of Venus,</a>
<a id='line_5433'>     for whom she must accomplish fearful tasks. But the gods and</a>
<a id='line_5434'>     all nature helped her, and in process of time she was</a>

<a id='line_5483'></a>
<a id='line_5484'>This poem, although so much lighter in spirit, bears a certain relation</a>
<a id='line_5485'>in thought to Keats's other odes. In the _Nightingale_ the tragedy of</a>
<a id='line_5486'>this life made him long to escape, on the wings of imagination, to the</a>
<a id='line_5487'>ideal world of beauty symbolized by the song of the bird. Here finding</a>
<a id='line_5488'>all real things, even the most beautiful, pall upon him, he extols the</a>
<a id='line_5489'>fancy, which can escape from reality and is not tied by place or season</a>
<a id='line_5490'>in its search for new joys. This is, of course, only a passing mood, as</a>
<a id='line_5491'>the extempore character of the poetry indicates. We see more of settled</a>
<a id='line_5492'>conviction in the deeply-meditative _Ode to Autumn_, where he finds the</a>
<a id='line_5493'>ideal in the rich and ever-changing real.</a>

<a id='line_5564'>INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD.</a>
<a id='line_5565'></a>
<a id='line_5566'>Early in 1818 John Hamilton Reynolds, a friend of Keats, sent him two</a>
<a id='line_5567'>sonnets which he had written 'On Robin Hood'. Keats, in his letter of</a>
<a id='line_5568'>thanks, after giving an appreciation of Reynolds's production, says: 'In</a>
<a id='line_5569'>return for your Dish of Filberts, I have gathered a few Catkins, I hope</a>
<a id='line_5570'>they'll look pretty.' Then follow these lines, entitled, 'To J. H. R. in</a>
<a id='line_5571'>answer to his Robin Hood sonnets.' At the end he writes: 'I hope you</a>
<a id='line_5572'>will like them--they are at least written in the spirit of outlawry.'</a>
<a id='line_5573'></a>
<a id='line_5574'>Robin Hood, the outlaw, was a popular hero of the Middle Ages. He was a</a>
<a id='line_5575'>great poacher of deer, brave, chivalrous, generous, full of fun, and</a>
<a id='line_5576'>absolutely without respect for law and order. He robbed the rich to give</a>
<a id='line_5577'>to the poor, and waged ceaseless war against the wealthy prelates of the</a>
<a id='line_5578'>church. Indeed, of his endless practical jokes, the majority were played</a>
<a id='line_5579'>upon sheriffs and bishops. He lived, with his 'merry men', in Sherwood</a>
<a id='line_5580'>Forest, where a hollow tree, said to be his 'larder', is still shown.</a>
<a id='line_5581'></a>
<a id='line_5582'>Innumerable ballads telling of his exploits were composed, the first</a>
<a id='line_5583'>reference to which is in the second edition of Langland's _Piers</a>
<a id='line_5584'>Plowman_, c. 1377. Many of these ballads still survive, but in all these</a>
<a id='line_5585'>traditions it is quite impossible to disentangle fact from fiction.</a>

<a id='line_5696'></a>
<a id='line_5697'>This poem deals with the overthrow of the primaeval order of Gods by</a>
<a id='line_5698'>Jupiter, son of Saturn the old king. There are many versions of the</a>
<a id='line_5699'>fable in Greek mythology, and there are many sources from which it may</a>
<a id='line_5700'>have come to Keats. At school he is said to have known the classical</a>
<a id='line_5701'>dictionary by heart, but his inspiration is more likely to have been due</a>
<a id='line_5702'>to his later reading of the Elizabethan poets, and their translations of</a>
<a id='line_5703'>classic story. One thing is certain, that he did not confine himself to</a>
<a id='line_5704'>any one authority, nor did he consider it necessary to be circumscribed</a>
<a id='line_5705'>by authorities at all. He used, rather than followed, the Greek fable,</a>
<a id='line_5706'>dealing freely with it and giving it his own interpretation.</a>
<a id='line_5707'></a>
<a id='line_5708'>The situation when the poem opens is as follows:--Saturn, king of the</a>
<a id='line_5709'>gods, has been driven from Olympus down into a deep dell, by his son</a>
<a id='line_5710'>Jupiter, who has seized and used his father's weapon, the thunderbolt. A</a>
<a id='line_5711'>similar fate has overtaken nearly all his brethren, who are called by</a>
<a id='line_5712'>Keats Titans and Giants indiscriminately, though in Greek mythology the</a>
<a id='line_5713'>two races are quite distinct. These Titans are the children of Tellus</a>
<a id='line_5714'>and Coelus, the earth and sky, thus representing, as it were, the first</a>
<a id='line_5715'>birth of form and personality from formless nature. Before the</a>
<a id='line_5716'>separation of earth and sky, Chaos, a confusion of the elements of all</a>
<a id='line_5717'>things, had reigned supreme. One only of the Titans, Hyperion the</a>
<a id='line_5718'>sun-god, still keeps his kingdom, and he is about to be superseded by</a>
<a id='line_5719'>young Apollo, the god of light and song.</a>
<a id='line_5720'></a>
<a id='line_5721'>In the second book we hear Oceanus and Clymene his daughter tell how</a>
<a id='line_5722'>both were defeated not by battle or violence, but by the irresistible</a>
<a id='line_5723'>beauty of their dispossessors; and from this Oceanus deduces 'the</a>
<a id='line_5724'>eternal law, that first in beauty should be first in might'. He recalls</a>
<a id='line_5725'>the fact that Saturn himself was not the first ruler, but received his</a>
<a id='line_5726'>kingdom from his parents, the earth and sky, and he prophesies that</a>
<a id='line_5727'>progress will continue in the overthrow of Jove by a yet brighter and</a>
<a id='line_5728'>better order. Enceladus is, however, furious at what he considers a</a>
<a id='line_5729'>cowardly acceptance of their fate, and urges his brethren to resist.</a>
<a id='line_5730'></a>
<a id='line_5731'>In Book I we saw Hyperion, though still a god, distressed by portents,</a>
<a id='line_5732'>and now in Book III we see the rise to divinity of his successor, the</a>
<a id='line_5733'>young Apollo. The poem breaks off short at the moment of Apollo's</a>
<a id='line_5734'>metamorphosis, and how Keats intended to complete it we can never know.</a>
<a id='line_5735'></a>
<a id='line_5736'>It is certain that he originally meant to write an epic in ten books,</a>
<a id='line_5737'>and the publisher's remark[245:1] at the beginning of the 1820 volume</a>
<a id='line_5738'>would lead us to think that he was in the same mind when he wrote the</a>
<a id='line_5739'>poem. This statement, however, must be altogether discounted, as Keats,</a>
<a id='line_5740'>in his copy of the poems, crossed it right out and wrote above, 'I had</a>
<a id='line_5741'>no part in this; I was ill at the time.'</a>
<a id='line_5742'></a>
<a id='line_5743'>Moreover, the last sentence (from 'but' to 'proceeding') he bracketed,</a>
<a id='line_5744'>writing below, 'This is a lie.'</a>
<a id='line_5745'></a>
<a id='line_5746'>This, together with other evidence external and internal, has led Dr. de</a>
<a id='line_5747'>Sélincourt to the conclusion that Keats had modified his plan and, when</a>
<a id='line_5748'>he was writing the poem, intended to conclude it in four books. Of the</a>
<a id='line_5749'>probable contents of the one-and-half unwritten books Mr. de Sélincourt</a>
<a id='line_5750'>writes: 'I conceive that Apollo, now conscious of his divinity, would</a>
<a id='line_5751'>have gone to Olympus, heard from the lips of Jove of his newly-acquired</a>
<a id='line_5752'>supremacy, and been called upon by the rebel three to secure the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_5753'>that awaited him. He would have gone forth to meet Hyperion, who, struck</a>
<a id='line_5754'>by the power of supreme beauty, would have found resistance impossible.</a>
<a id='line_5755'>Critics have inclined to take for granted the supposition that an actual</a>
<a id='line_5756'>battle was contemplated by Keats, but I do not believe that such was, at</a>
<a id='line_5757'>least, his final intention. In the first place, he had the example of</a>
<a id='line_5758'>Milton, whom he was studying very closely, to warn him of its dangers;</a>
<a id='line_5759'>in the second, if Hyperion had been meant to fight he would hardly be</a>
<a id='line_5760'>represented as already, before the battle, shorn of much of his</a>
<a id='line_5761'>strength; thus making the victory of Apollo depend upon his enemy's</a>
<a id='line_5762'>unnatural weakness and not upon his own strength. One may add that a</a>
<a id='line_5763'>combat would have been completely alien to the whole idea of the poem as</a>
<a id='line_5764'>Keats conceived it, and as, in fact, it is universally interpreted from</a>
<a id='line_5765'>the speech of Oceanus in the second book. The resistance of Enceladus</a>
<a id='line_5766'>and the Giants, themselves rebels against an order already established,</a>
<a id='line_5767'>would have been dealt with summarily, and the poem would have closed</a>
<a id='line_5768'>with a description of the new age which had been inaugurated by the</a>
<a id='line_5769'>triumph of the Olympians, and, in particular, of Apollo the god of light</a>
<a id='line_5770'>and song.'</a>
<a id='line_5771'></a>
<a id='line_5772'>The central idea, then, of the poem is that the new age triumphs over</a>
<a id='line_5773'>the old by virtue of its acknowledged superiority--that intellectual</a>
<a id='line_5774'>supremacy makes physical force feel its power and yield. Dignity and</a>
<a id='line_5775'>moral conquest lies, for the conquered, in the capacity to recognize the</a>
<a id='line_5776'>truth and look upon the inevitable undismayed.</a>
<a id='line_5777'></a>
<a id='line_5778'>Keats broke the poem off because it was too 'Miltonic', and it is easy</a>
<a id='line_5779'>to see what he meant. Not only does the treatment of the subject recall</a>
<a id='line_5780'>that of _Paradise Lost_, the council of the fallen gods bearing special</a>
<a id='line_5781'>resemblance to that of the fallen angels in Book II of Milton's epic,</a>
<a id='line_5782'>but in its style and syntax the influence of Milton is everywhere</a>
<a id='line_5783'>apparent. It is to be seen in the restraint and concentration of the</a>
<a id='line_5784'>language, which is in marked contrast to the wordiness of Keats's early</a>
<a id='line_5785'>work, as well as in the constant use of classical constructions,[247:1]</a>
<a id='line_5786'>Miltonic inversions[247:2] and repetitions,[247:3] and in occasional</a>
<a id='line_5787'>reminiscences of actual lines and phrases in _Paradise Lost_.[247:4]</a>
<a id='line_5788'></a>
<a id='line_5789'>In _Hyperion_ we see, too, the influence of the study of Greek</a>
<a id='line_5790'>sculpture upon Keats's mind and art. This study had taught him that the</a>
<a id='line_5791'>highest beauty is not incompatible with definiteness of form and</a>
<a id='line_5792'>clearness of detail. To his romantic appreciation of mystery was now</a>
<a id='line_5793'>added an equal sense of the importance of simplicity, form, and</a>
<a id='line_5794'>proportion, these being, from its nature, inevitable characteristics of</a>
<a id='line_5795'>the art of sculpture. So we see that again and again the figures</a>
<a id='line_5796'>described in _Hyperion_ are like great statues--clear-cut, massive, and</a>
<a id='line_5797'>motionless. Such are the pictures of Saturn and Thea in Book I, and of</a>
<a id='line_5798'>each of the group of Titans at the opening of Book II.</a>
<a id='line_5799'></a>
<a id='line_5800'>Striking too is Keats's very Greek identification of the gods with the</a>
<a id='line_5801'>powers of Nature which they represent. It is this attitude of mind which</a>
<a id='line_5802'>has led some people--Shelley and Landor among them--to declare Keats, in</a>
<a id='line_5803'>spite of his ignorance of the language, the most truly Greek of all</a>
<a id='line_5804'>English poets. Very beautiful instances of this are the sunset and</a>
<a id='line_5805'>sunrise in Book I, when the departure of the sun-god and his return to</a>
<a id='line_5806'>earth are so described that the pictures we see are of an evening and</a>
<a id='line_5807'>morning sky, an angry sunset, and a grey and misty dawn.</a>
<a id='line_5808'></a>
<a id='line_5809'>But neither Miltonic nor Greek is Keats's marvellous treatment of nature</a>
<a id='line_5810'>as he feels, and makes us feel, the magic of its mystery in such a</a>
<a id='line_5811'>picture as that of the</a>
<a id='line_5812'></a>
<a id='line_5813'>                               tall oaks</a>
<a id='line_5814'>     Branch-charmèd by the earnest stars,</a>
<a id='line_5815'></a>

<a id='line_5821'>     In dull November, and their chancel vault,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>     The heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.</a>
<a id='line_5823'></a>
<a id='line_5824'>This Keats, and Keats alone, could do; and his achievement is unique in</a>
<a id='line_5825'>throwing all the glamour of romance over a fragment 'sublime as</a>
<a id='line_5826'>Aeschylus'.</a>
