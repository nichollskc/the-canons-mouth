<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a</a>
<a id='line_4'>declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were</a>
<a id='line_6'>eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 1:3 It seemed good to me</a>
<a id='line_7'>also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very</a>
<a id='line_8'>first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 1:4</a>
<a id='line_9'>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou</a>
<a id='line_10'>hast been instructed.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain</a>
<a id='line_13'>priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the</a>
<a id='line_14'>daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the</a>
<a id='line_17'>commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they</a>
<a id='line_20'>both were now well stricken in years.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office</a>
<a id='line_23'>before God in the order of his course, 1:9 According to the custom of</a>
<a id='line_24'>the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the</a>
<a id='line_25'>temple of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the</a>
<a id='line_28'>time of incense.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the</a>
<a id='line_31'>right side of the altar of incense.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon</a>
<a id='line_34'>him.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer</a>
<a id='line_37'>is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_38'>call his name John.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at</a>
<a id='line_41'>his birth.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink</a>
<a id='line_44'>neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy</a>
<a id='line_45'>Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord</a>
<a id='line_48'>their God.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to</a>
<a id='line_51'>turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to</a>
<a id='line_52'>the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>1:18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for</a>
<a id='line_55'>I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>1:19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand</a>
<a id='line_58'>in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew</a>
<a id='line_59'>thee these glad tidings.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the</a>
<a id='line_62'>day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not</a>
<a id='line_63'>my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>1:21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he</a>
<a id='line_66'>tarried so long in the temple.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>1:22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they</a>
<a id='line_69'>perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned</a>
<a id='line_70'>unto them, and remained speechless.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>1:23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his</a>
<a id='line_73'>ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>1:24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid</a>
<a id='line_76'>herself five months, saying, 1:25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in</a>
<a id='line_77'>the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a</a>
<a id='line_80'>city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man</a>
<a id='line_81'>whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name</a>
<a id='line_82'>was Mary.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>1:28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art</a>
<a id='line_85'>highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>1:29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in</a>
<a id='line_88'>her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found</a>
<a id='line_91'>favour with God.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a</a>
<a id='line_94'>son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:</a>
<a id='line_97'>and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</a>
<a id='line_98'>1:33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his</a>
<a id='line_99'>kingdom there shall be no end.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>1:34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know</a>
<a id='line_102'>not a man?  1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy</a>
<a id='line_103'>Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall</a>
<a id='line_104'>overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of</a>
<a id='line_105'>thee shall be called the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>1:36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son</a>
<a id='line_108'>in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called</a>
<a id='line_109'>barren.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me</a>
<a id='line_114'>according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>1:39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with</a>
<a id='line_117'>haste, into a city of Juda; 1:40 And entered into the house of</a>
<a id='line_118'>Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>1:41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of</a>
<a id='line_121'>Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the</a>
<a id='line_122'>Holy Ghost: 1:42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said,</a>
<a id='line_123'>Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>1:43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come</a>
<a id='line_126'>to me?  1:44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded</a>
<a id='line_127'>in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>1:45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a</a>
<a id='line_130'>performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 1:47 And my spirit</a>
<a id='line_133'>hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>1:48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,</a>
<a id='line_136'>behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>1:49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is</a>
<a id='line_139'>his name.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>1:50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to</a>
<a id='line_142'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>1:51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud</a>
<a id='line_145'>in the imagination of their hearts.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>1:52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of</a>
<a id='line_148'>low degree.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath</a>
<a id='line_151'>sent empty away.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>1:54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</a>
<a id='line_154'>1:55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>1:56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her</a>
<a id='line_157'>own house.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>1:57 Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and</a>
<a id='line_160'>she brought forth a son.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>1:58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed</a>
<a id='line_163'>great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>1:59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to</a>
<a id='line_166'>circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of</a>
<a id='line_167'>his father.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>1:60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called</a>
<a id='line_170'>John.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>1:61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is</a>
<a id='line_173'>called by this name.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>1:62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>1:63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is</a>
<a id='line_178'>John. And they marvelled all.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>1:64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and</a>
<a id='line_181'>he spake, and praised God.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>1:65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these</a>
<a id='line_184'>sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>1:66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,</a>
<a id='line_187'>saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord</a>
<a id='line_188'>was with him.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>1:67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and</a>
<a id='line_191'>prophesied, saying, 1:68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he</a>
<a id='line_192'>hath visited and redeemed his people, 1:69 And hath raised up an horn</a>
<a id='line_193'>of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; 1:70 As he</a>
<a id='line_194'>spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the</a>
<a id='line_195'>world began: 1:71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from</a>
<a id='line_196'>the hand of all that hate us; 1:72 To perform the mercy promised to</a>
<a id='line_197'>our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; 1:73 The oath which he</a>
<a id='line_198'>sware to our father Abraham, 1:74 That he would grant unto us, that we</a>
<a id='line_199'>being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without</a>
<a id='line_200'>fear, 1:75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of</a>
<a id='line_201'>our life.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>1:76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for</a>
<a id='line_204'>thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 1:77 To</a>
<a id='line_205'>give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their</a>
<a id='line_206'>sins, 1:78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring</a>
<a id='line_207'>from on high hath visited us, 1:79 To give light to them that sit in</a>
<a id='line_208'>darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of</a>
<a id='line_209'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>1:80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the</a>
<a id='line_212'>deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>2:1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree</a>
<a id='line_215'>from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>2:2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of</a>
<a id='line_218'>Syria.)  2:3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>2:4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,</a>
<a id='line_221'>into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;</a>
<a id='line_222'>(because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 2:5 To be taxed</a>
<a id='line_223'>with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>2:6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were</a>
<a id='line_226'>accomplished that she should be delivered.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>2:7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in</a>
<a id='line_229'>swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room</a>
<a id='line_230'>for them in the inn.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,</a>
<a id='line_233'>keeping watch over their flock by night.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>2:9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of</a>
<a id='line_236'>the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>2:10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you</a>
<a id='line_239'>good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,</a>
<a id='line_242'>which is Christ the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>2:12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped</a>
<a id='line_245'>in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>2:13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly</a>
<a id='line_248'>host praising God, and saying, 2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and</a>
<a id='line_249'>on earth peace, good will toward men.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>2:15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into</a>
<a id='line_252'>heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto</a>
<a id='line_253'>Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord</a>
<a id='line_254'>hath made known unto us.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>2:16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the</a>
<a id='line_257'>babe lying in a manger.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>2:17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying</a>
<a id='line_260'>which was told them concerning this child.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>2:18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were</a>
<a id='line_263'>told them by the shepherds.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>2:19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>2:20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all</a>
<a id='line_268'>the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>2:21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the</a>
<a id='line_271'>child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel</a>
<a id='line_272'>before he was conceived in the womb.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>2:22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of</a>
<a id='line_275'>Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him</a>
<a id='line_276'>to the Lord; 2:23 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male</a>
<a id='line_277'>that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 2:24 And to</a>
<a id='line_278'>offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the</a>
<a id='line_279'>Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>2:25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon;</a>
<a id='line_282'>and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of</a>
<a id='line_283'>Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>2:26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should</a>
<a id='line_286'>not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>2:27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents</a>
<a id='line_289'>brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</a>
<a id='line_290'>2:28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 2:29</a>
<a id='line_291'>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy</a>
<a id='line_292'>word: 2:30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 2:31 Which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_293'>prepared before the face of all people; 2:32 A light to lighten the</a>
<a id='line_294'>Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>2:33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were</a>
<a id='line_297'>spoken of him.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_300'>this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and</a>
<a id='line_301'>for a sign which shall be spoken against; 2:35 (Yea, a sword shall</a>
<a id='line_302'>pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts</a>
<a id='line_303'>may be revealed.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of</a>
<a id='line_306'>the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an</a>
<a id='line_307'>husband seven years from her virginity; 2:37 And she was a widow of</a>
<a id='line_308'>about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple,</a>
<a id='line_309'>but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>2:38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the</a>
<a id='line_312'>Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in</a>
<a id='line_313'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>2:39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of</a>
<a id='line_316'>the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>2:40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with</a>
<a id='line_319'>wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>2:41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the</a>
<a id='line_322'>passover.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>2:42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after</a>
<a id='line_325'>the custom of the feast.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>2:43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child</a>
<a id='line_328'>Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not</a>
<a id='line_329'>of it.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>2:44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s</a>
<a id='line_332'>journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>2:45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_335'>seeking him.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>2:46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the</a>
<a id='line_338'>temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and</a>
<a id='line_339'>asking them questions.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>2:47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and</a>
<a id='line_342'>answers.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>2:48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto</a>
<a id='line_345'>him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I</a>
<a id='line_346'>have sought thee sorrowing.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>2:49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not</a>
<a id='line_349'>that I must be about my Father’s business?  2:50 And they understood</a>
<a id='line_350'>not the saying which he spake unto them.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject</a>
<a id='line_353'>unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God</a>
<a id='line_356'>and man.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius</a>
<a id='line_359'>Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,</a>
<a id='line_360'>and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of</a>
<a id='line_361'>Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 3:2 Annas and</a>
<a id='line_362'>Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the</a>
<a id='line_363'>son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>3:3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the</a>
<a id='line_366'>baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; 3:4 As it is written</a>
<a id='line_367'>in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of</a>
<a id='line_368'>one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his</a>
<a id='line_369'>paths straight.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>3:5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be</a>
<a id='line_372'>brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough</a>
<a id='line_373'>ways shall be made smooth; 3:6 And all flesh shall see the salvation</a>
<a id='line_374'>of God.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>3:7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of</a>
<a id='line_377'>him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the</a>
<a id='line_378'>wrath to come?  3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance,</a>
<a id='line_379'>and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:</a>
<a id='line_380'>for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up</a>
<a id='line_381'>children unto Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>3:9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every</a>
<a id='line_384'>tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and</a>
<a id='line_385'>cast into the fire.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>3:10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?  3:11 He</a>
<a id='line_388'>answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart</a>
<a id='line_389'>to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>3:12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_392'>Master, what shall we do?  3:13 And he said unto them, Exact no more</a>
<a id='line_393'>than that which is appointed you.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>3:14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall</a>
<a id='line_396'>we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse</a>
<a id='line_397'>any falsely; and be content with your wages.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>3:15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their</a>
<a id='line_400'>hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 3:16 John</a>
<a id='line_401'>answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but</a>
<a id='line_402'>one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy</a>
<a id='line_403'>to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:</a>
<a id='line_404'>3:17 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,</a>
<a id='line_405'>and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn</a>
<a id='line_406'>with fire unquenchable.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>3:18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the</a>
<a id='line_409'>people.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>3:19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his</a>
<a id='line_412'>brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</a>
<a id='line_413'>3:20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that</a>
<a id='line_416'>Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 3:22</a>
<a id='line_417'>And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him,</a>
<a id='line_418'>and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in</a>
<a id='line_419'>thee I am well pleased.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>3:23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being</a>

<a id='line_456'>4:1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and</a>
<a id='line_457'>was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 4:2 Being forty days</a>
<a id='line_458'>tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when</a>
<a id='line_459'>they were ended, he afterward hungered.</a>
<a id='line_460'></a>
<a id='line_461'>4:3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command</a>
<a id='line_462'>this stone that it be made bread.</a>
<a id='line_463'></a>
<a id='line_464'>4:4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not</a>
<a id='line_465'>live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</a>
<a id='line_466'></a>
<a id='line_467'>4:5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto</a>
<a id='line_468'>him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>4:6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and</a>
<a id='line_471'>the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I</a>
<a id='line_472'>will I give it.</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>4:7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>4:8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:</a>
<a id='line_477'>for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only</a>
<a id='line_478'>shalt thou serve.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>4:9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the</a>
<a id='line_481'>temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself</a>
<a id='line_482'>down from hence: 4:10 For it is written, He shall give his angels</a>
<a id='line_483'>charge over thee, to keep thee: 4:11 And in their hands they shall</a>
<a id='line_484'>bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>4:12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_487'>tempt the Lord thy God.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>4:13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from</a>
<a id='line_490'>him for a season.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>4:14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and</a>
<a id='line_493'>there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>4:15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as</a>
<a id='line_498'>his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and</a>
<a id='line_499'>stood up for to read.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>4:17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.</a>
<a id='line_502'>And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was</a>
<a id='line_503'>written, 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath</a>
<a id='line_504'>anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal</a>
<a id='line_505'>the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and</a>
<a id='line_506'>recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are</a>
<a id='line_507'>bruised, 4:19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_508'></a>
<a id='line_509'>4:20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and</a>
<a id='line_510'>sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were</a>
<a id='line_511'>fastened on him.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>4:21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture</a>
<a id='line_514'>fulfilled in your ears.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>4:22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words</a>
<a id='line_517'>which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s</a>
<a id='line_518'>son?  4:23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this</a>
<a id='line_519'>proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in</a>
<a id='line_520'>Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>4:24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his</a>
<a id='line_523'>own country.</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>4:25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days</a>
<a id='line_526'>of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when</a>
<a id='line_527'>great famine was throughout all the land; 4:26 But unto none of them</a>
<a id='line_528'>was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that</a>
<a id='line_529'>was a widow.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>4:27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the</a>
<a id='line_532'>prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>4:28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were</a>
<a id='line_535'>filled with wrath, 4:29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city,</a>
<a id='line_536'>and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built,</a>
<a id='line_537'>that they might cast him down headlong.</a>
<a id='line_538'></a>
<a id='line_539'>4:30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way, 4:31 And</a>
<a id='line_540'>came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the</a>
<a id='line_541'>sabbath days.</a>
<a id='line_542'></a>
<a id='line_543'>4:32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with</a>
<a id='line_544'>power.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>4:33 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an</a>
<a id='line_547'>unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 4:34 Saying, Let us</a>
<a id='line_548'>alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou</a>
<a id='line_549'>come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.</a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'>4:35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of</a>
<a id='line_552'>him.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him,</a>
<a id='line_555'>and hurt him not.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>4:36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,</a>
<a id='line_558'>What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the</a>
<a id='line_559'>unclean spirits, and they come out.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>4:37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country</a>
<a id='line_562'>round about.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>4:38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s</a>
<a id='line_565'>house.</a>
<a id='line_566'></a>
<a id='line_567'>And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they</a>
<a id='line_568'>besought him for her.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>4:39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:</a>
<a id='line_571'>and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>4:40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with</a>
<a id='line_574'>divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every</a>
<a id='line_575'>one of them, and healed them.</a>
<a id='line_576'></a>
<a id='line_577'>4:41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou</a>
<a id='line_578'>art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to</a>
<a id='line_579'>speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</a>
<a id='line_580'></a>
<a id='line_581'>4:42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:</a>
<a id='line_582'>and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he</a>
<a id='line_583'>should not depart from them.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>4:43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other</a>
<a id='line_586'>cities also: for therefore am I sent.</a>
<a id='line_587'></a>
<a id='line_588'>4:44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>5:1 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear</a>
<a id='line_591'>the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 5:2 And saw two</a>
<a id='line_592'>ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them,</a>
<a id='line_593'>and were washing their nets.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>5:3 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and</a>
<a id='line_596'>prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat</a>
<a id='line_597'>down, and taught the people out of the ship.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>5:4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into</a>
<a id='line_600'>the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>5:5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the</a>
<a id='line_603'>night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let</a>
<a id='line_604'>down the net.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>5:6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of</a>
<a id='line_607'>fishes: and their net brake.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>5:7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other</a>
<a id='line_610'>ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled</a>
<a id='line_611'>both the ships, so that they began to sink.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>5:8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,</a>
<a id='line_614'>Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>5:9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught</a>
<a id='line_617'>of the fishes which they had taken: 5:10 And so was also James, and</a>
<a id='line_618'>John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus</a>
<a id='line_619'>said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>5:11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all,</a>
<a id='line_622'>and followed him.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>5:12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man</a>
<a id='line_625'>full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him,</a>
<a id='line_626'>saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</a>
<a id='line_627'></a>
<a id='line_628'>5:13 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be</a>
<a id='line_629'>thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</a>
<a id='line_630'></a>
<a id='line_631'>5:14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to</a>
<a id='line_632'>the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded,</a>
<a id='line_633'>for a testimony unto them.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>5:15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great</a>
<a id='line_636'>multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their</a>
<a id='line_637'>infirmities.</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>5:16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that</a>
<a id='line_642'>there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were</a>
<a id='line_643'>come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the</a>
<a id='line_644'>power of the Lord was present to heal them.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>5:18 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a</a>
<a id='line_647'>palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before</a>
<a id='line_648'>him.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>5:19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in</a>
<a id='line_651'>because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him</a>
<a id='line_652'>down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>5:20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are</a>
<a id='line_655'>forgiven thee.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>5:21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is</a>
<a id='line_658'>this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</a>
<a id='line_659'>5:22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto</a>
<a id='line_660'>them, What reason ye in your hearts?  5:23 Whether is easier, to say,</a>
<a id='line_661'>Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?  5:24 But that</a>
<a id='line_662'>ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</a>
<a id='line_663'>(he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take</a>
<a id='line_664'>up thy couch, and go into thine house.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>5:25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon</a>
<a id='line_667'>he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'>5:26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled</a>
<a id='line_670'>with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>5:27 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named</a>
<a id='line_673'>Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow</a>
<a id='line_674'>me.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>5:28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</a>
<a id='line_677'></a>
<a id='line_678'>5:29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a</a>
<a id='line_679'>great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>5:30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,</a>
<a id='line_682'>saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?  5:31 And</a>
<a id='line_683'>Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a</a>
<a id='line_684'>physician; but they that are sick.</a>
<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>5:32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>5:33 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,</a>
<a id='line_689'>and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but</a>
<a id='line_690'>thine eat and drink?  5:34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the</a>
<a id='line_691'>children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</a>
<a id='line_692'>5:35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away</a>
<a id='line_693'>from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>5:36 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of</a>
<a id='line_696'>a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a</a>
<a id='line_697'>rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the</a>
<a id='line_698'>old.</a>
<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>5:37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine</a>
<a id='line_701'>will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</a>
<a id='line_702'></a>
<a id='line_703'>5:38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are</a>
<a id='line_704'>preserved.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>5:39 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for</a>
<a id='line_707'>he saith, The old is better.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>6:1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he</a>
<a id='line_710'>went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of</a>
<a id='line_711'>corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.</a>
<a id='line_712'></a>
<a id='line_713'>6:2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which</a>
<a id='line_714'>is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?  6:3 And Jesus answering them</a>
<a id='line_715'>said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself</a>
<a id='line_716'>was an hungred, and they which were with him; 6:4 How he went into the</a>
<a id='line_717'>house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to</a>
<a id='line_718'>them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the</a>
<a id='line_719'>priests alone?  6:5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord</a>
<a id='line_720'>also of the sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_721'></a>
<a id='line_722'>6:6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into</a>
<a id='line_723'>the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was</a>
<a id='line_724'>withered.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>6:7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal</a>
<a id='line_727'>on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>6:8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the</a>
<a id='line_730'>withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and</a>
<a id='line_731'>stood forth.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>6:9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful</a>
<a id='line_734'>on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to</a>
<a id='line_735'>destroy it?  6:10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto</a>
<a id='line_736'>the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was</a>
<a id='line_737'>restored whole as the other.</a>
<a id='line_738'></a>
<a id='line_739'>6:11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another</a>
<a id='line_740'>what they might do to Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_741'></a>
<a id='line_742'>6:12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a</a>
<a id='line_743'>mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>6:13 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of</a>
<a id='line_746'>them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 6:14 Simon, (whom</a>
<a id='line_747'>he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip</a>
<a id='line_748'>and Bartholomew, 6:15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,</a>
<a id='line_749'>and Simon called Zelotes, 6:16 And Judas the brother of James, and</a>
<a id='line_750'>Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.</a>
<a id='line_751'></a>
<a id='line_752'>6:17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the</a>
<a id='line_753'>company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all</a>
<a id='line_754'>Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which</a>
<a id='line_755'>came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 6:18 And they</a>
<a id='line_756'>that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.</a>
<a id='line_757'></a>
<a id='line_758'>6:19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went</a>
<a id='line_759'>virtue out of him, and healed them all.</a>
<a id='line_760'></a>
<a id='line_761'>6:20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be</a>
<a id='line_762'>ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>6:21 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed</a>
<a id='line_765'>are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>6:22 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall</a>
<a id='line_768'>separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out</a>
<a id='line_769'>your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>6:23 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your</a>
<a id='line_772'>reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers</a>
<a id='line_773'>unto the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>6:24 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your</a>
<a id='line_776'>consolation.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>6:25 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you</a>
<a id='line_779'>that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</a>
<a id='line_780'></a>
<a id='line_781'>6:26 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did</a>
<a id='line_782'>their fathers to the false prophets.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them</a>
<a id='line_785'>which hate you, 6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them</a>
<a id='line_786'>which despitefully use you.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the</a>
<a id='line_789'>other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat</a>
<a id='line_790'>also.</a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh</a>
<a id='line_793'>away thy goods ask them not again.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them</a>
<a id='line_796'>likewise.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for</a>
<a id='line_799'>sinners also love those that love them.</a>
<a id='line_800'></a>
<a id='line_801'>6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have</a>
<a id='line_802'>ye?  for sinners also do even the same.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank</a>
<a id='line_805'>have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for</a>
<a id='line_808'>nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the</a>
<a id='line_809'>children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the</a>
<a id='line_810'>evil.</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_815'>not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 6:38 Give, and it</a>
<a id='line_816'>shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken</a>
<a id='line_817'>together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with</a>
<a id='line_818'>the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you</a>
<a id='line_819'>again.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>6:39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?</a>
<a id='line_822'>shall they not both fall into the ditch?  6:40 The disciple is not</a>
<a id='line_823'>above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his</a>
<a id='line_824'>master.</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>
<a id='line_826'>6:41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but</a>
<a id='line_827'>perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  6:42 Either how</a>
<a id='line_828'>canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that</a>
<a id='line_829'>is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in</a>
<a id='line_830'>thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine</a>
<a id='line_831'>own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is</a>
<a id='line_832'>in thy brother’s eye.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>6:43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a</a>
<a id='line_835'>corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</a>
<a id='line_836'></a>
<a id='line_837'>6:44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do</a>
<a id='line_838'>not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>6:45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth</a>
<a id='line_841'>that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his</a>
<a id='line_842'>heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the</a>
<a id='line_843'>heart his mouth speaketh.</a>
<a id='line_844'></a>
<a id='line_845'>6:46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I</a>
<a id='line_846'>say?  6:47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth</a>
<a id='line_847'>them, I will shew you to whom he is like: 6:48 He is like a man which</a>
<a id='line_848'>built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock:</a>
<a id='line_849'>and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house,</a>
<a id='line_850'>and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>6:49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a</a>
<a id='line_853'>foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did</a>
<a id='line_854'>beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house</a>
<a id='line_855'>was great.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>7:1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the</a>
<a id='line_858'>people, he entered into Capernaum.</a>
<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>7:2 And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was</a>
<a id='line_861'>sick, and ready to die.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>7:3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the</a>
<a id='line_864'>Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'>7:4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,</a>
<a id='line_867'>That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 7:5 For he loveth our</a>
<a id='line_868'>nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</a>
<a id='line_869'></a>
<a id='line_870'>7:6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the</a>
<a id='line_871'>house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord,</a>
<a id='line_872'>trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter</a>
<a id='line_873'>under my roof: 7:7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come</a>
<a id='line_874'>unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</a>
<a id='line_875'></a>
<a id='line_876'>7:8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_877'>and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he</a>
<a id='line_878'>cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>7:9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him</a>
<a id='line_881'>about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I</a>
<a id='line_882'>have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>7:10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the</a>
<a id='line_885'>servant whole that had been sick.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>7:11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city</a>
<a id='line_888'>called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</a>
<a id='line_889'></a>
<a id='line_890'>7:12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was</a>
<a id='line_891'>a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a</a>
<a id='line_892'>widow: and much people of the city was with her.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>7:13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said</a>
<a id='line_895'>unto her, Weep not.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>7:14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood</a>
<a id='line_898'>still.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</a>
<a id='line_901'></a>
<a id='line_902'>7:15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered</a>
<a id='line_903'>him to his mother.</a>
<a id='line_904'></a>
<a id='line_905'>7:16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,</a>
<a id='line_906'>That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited</a>
<a id='line_907'>his people.</a>
<a id='line_908'></a>
<a id='line_909'>7:17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and</a>
<a id='line_910'>throughout all the region round about.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>7:18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</a>
<a id='line_913'></a>
<a id='line_914'>7:19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to</a>
<a id='line_915'>Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</a>
<a id='line_916'>7:20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath</a>
<a id='line_917'>sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we</a>
<a id='line_918'>for another?  7:21 And in that same hour he cured many of their</a>
<a id='line_919'>infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were</a>
<a id='line_920'>blind he gave sight.</a>
<a id='line_921'></a>
<a id='line_922'>7:22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John</a>
<a id='line_923'>what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame</a>
<a id='line_924'>walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to</a>
<a id='line_925'>the poor the gospel is preached.</a>
<a id='line_926'></a>
<a id='line_927'>7:23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>7:24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak</a>
<a id='line_930'>unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness</a>
<a id='line_931'>for to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?  7:25 But what went ye out</a>
<a id='line_932'>for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they which are</a>
<a id='line_933'>gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>7:26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,</a>
<a id='line_936'>and much more than a prophet.</a>
<a id='line_937'></a>
<a id='line_938'>7:27 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger</a>
<a id='line_939'>before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>7:28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is</a>
<a id='line_942'>not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in</a>
<a id='line_943'>the kingdom of God is greater than he.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>7:29 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified</a>
<a id='line_946'>God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against</a>
<a id='line_949'>themselves, being not baptized of him.</a>
<a id='line_950'></a>
<a id='line_951'>7:31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this</a>
<a id='line_952'>generation? and to what are they like?  7:32 They are like unto</a>
<a id='line_953'>children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and</a>
<a id='line_954'>saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have</a>
<a id='line_955'>mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>7:33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;</a>
<a id='line_958'>and ye say, He hath a devil.</a>
<a id='line_959'></a>
<a id='line_960'>7:34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a</a>
<a id='line_961'>gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</a>
<a id='line_962'>7:35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>7:36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.</a>
<a id='line_965'>And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>7:37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she</a>
<a id='line_968'>knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an</a>
<a id='line_969'>alabaster box of ointment, 7:38 And stood at his feet behind him</a>
<a id='line_970'>weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with</a>
<a id='line_971'>the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the</a>
<a id='line_972'>ointment.</a>
<a id='line_973'></a>
<a id='line_974'>7:39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake</a>
<a id='line_975'>within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have</a>
<a id='line_976'>known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she</a>
<a id='line_977'>is a sinner.</a>
<a id='line_978'></a>
<a id='line_979'>7:40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say</a>
<a id='line_980'>unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</a>
<a id='line_981'></a>
<a id='line_982'>7:41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed</a>
<a id='line_983'>five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</a>
<a id='line_984'></a>
<a id='line_985'>7:42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.</a>
<a id='line_986'>Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?  7:43 Simon</a>
<a id='line_987'>answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.</a>
<a id='line_988'></a>
<a id='line_989'>And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>7:44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this</a>
<a id='line_992'>woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my</a>
<a id='line_993'>feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the</a>
<a id='line_994'>hairs of her head.</a>
<a id='line_995'></a>
<a id='line_996'>7:45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in</a>
<a id='line_997'>hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</a>
<a id='line_998'></a>
<a id='line_999'>7:46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath</a>
<a id='line_1000'>anointed my feet with ointment.</a>
<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>7:47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are</a>
<a id='line_1003'>forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same</a>
<a id='line_1004'>loveth little.</a>
<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>7:48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</a>
<a id='line_1007'></a>
<a id='line_1008'>7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within</a>
<a id='line_1009'>themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  7:50 And he said to</a>
<a id='line_1010'>the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</a>
<a id='line_1011'></a>
<a id='line_1012'>8:1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city</a>
<a id='line_1013'>and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1014'>God: and the twelve were with him, 8:2 And certain women, which had</a>
<a id='line_1015'>been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene,</a>
<a id='line_1016'>out of whom went seven devils, 8:3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza</a>
<a id='line_1017'>Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto</a>
<a id='line_1018'>him of their substance.</a>
<a id='line_1019'></a>
<a id='line_1020'>8:4 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him</a>
<a id='line_1021'>out of every city, he spake by a parable: 8:5 A sower went out to sow</a>
<a id='line_1022'>his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was</a>
<a id='line_1023'>trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>8:6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it</a>
<a id='line_1026'>withered away, because it lacked moisture.</a>
<a id='line_1027'></a>
<a id='line_1028'>8:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and</a>
<a id='line_1029'>choked it.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>8:8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an</a>
<a id='line_1032'>hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath</a>
<a id='line_1033'>ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_1034'></a>
<a id='line_1035'>8:9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</a>
<a id='line_1036'>8:10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the</a>
<a id='line_1037'>kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not</a>
<a id='line_1038'>see, and hearing they might not understand.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</a>
<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'>8:12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,</a>
<a id='line_1043'>and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe</a>
<a id='line_1044'>and be saved.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>8:13 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and</a>
<a id='line_1048'>in time of temptation fall away.</a>
<a id='line_1049'></a>
<a id='line_1050'>8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have</a>
<a id='line_1051'>heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of</a>
<a id='line_1052'>this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</a>
<a id='line_1053'></a>
<a id='line_1054'>8:15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good</a>
<a id='line_1055'>heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with</a>
<a id='line_1056'>patience.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>8:16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they</a>
<a id='line_1060'>which enter in may see the light.</a>
<a id='line_1061'></a>
<a id='line_1062'>8:17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither</a>
<a id='line_1063'>any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>8:18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall</a>
<a id='line_1066'>be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that</a>
<a id='line_1067'>which he seemeth to have.</a>
<a id='line_1068'></a>
<a id='line_1069'>8:19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come</a>
<a id='line_1070'>at him for the press.</a>
<a id='line_1071'></a>
<a id='line_1072'>8:20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy</a>
<a id='line_1073'>brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>8:21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are</a>
<a id='line_1076'>these which hear the word of God, and do it.</a>
<a id='line_1077'></a>
<a id='line_1078'>8:22 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship</a>
<a id='line_1079'>with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the</a>
<a id='line_1080'>other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</a>
<a id='line_1081'></a>
<a id='line_1082'>8:23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of</a>
<a id='line_1083'>wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in</a>
<a id='line_1084'>jeopardy.</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>8:24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we</a>
<a id='line_1087'>perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the</a>
<a id='line_1088'>water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</a>
<a id='line_1089'></a>
<a id='line_1090'>8:25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid</a>
<a id='line_1091'>wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he</a>
<a id='line_1092'>commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</a>
<a id='line_1093'></a>
<a id='line_1094'>8:26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over</a>
<a id='line_1095'>against Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>8:27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a</a>
<a id='line_1098'>certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither</a>
<a id='line_1099'>abode in any house, but in the tombs.</a>
<a id='line_1100'></a>
<a id='line_1101'>8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and</a>
<a id='line_1102'>with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son</a>
<a id='line_1103'>of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>8:29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.</a>
<a id='line_1106'>For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains</a>
<a id='line_1107'>and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil</a>
<a id='line_1108'>into the wilderness.)  8:30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy</a>
<a id='line_1109'>name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</a>
<a id='line_1110'></a>
<a id='line_1111'>8:31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out</a>
<a id='line_1112'>into the deep.</a>
<a id='line_1113'></a>
<a id='line_1114'>8:32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the</a>
<a id='line_1115'>mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter</a>
<a id='line_1116'>into them. And he suffered them.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>8:33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:</a>
<a id='line_1119'>and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were</a>
<a id='line_1120'>choked.</a>
<a id='line_1121'></a>
<a id='line_1122'>8:34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went</a>
<a id='line_1123'>and told it in the city and in the country.</a>
<a id='line_1124'></a>
<a id='line_1125'>8:35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and</a>
<a id='line_1126'>found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the</a>
<a id='line_1127'>feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1128'></a>
<a id='line_1129'>8:36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was</a>
<a id='line_1130'>possessed of the devils was healed.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>8:37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round</a>
<a id='line_1133'>about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great</a>
<a id='line_1134'>fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>8:38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him</a>
<a id='line_1137'>that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 8:39</a>
<a id='line_1138'>Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done</a>
<a id='line_1139'>unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole</a>
<a id='line_1140'>city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1141'></a>
<a id='line_1142'>8:40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people</a>
<a id='line_1143'>gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</a>
<a id='line_1144'></a>
<a id='line_1145'>8:41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of</a>
<a id='line_1146'>the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that</a>
<a id='line_1147'>he would come into his house: 8:42 For he had one only daughter, about</a>
<a id='line_1148'>twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people</a>
<a id='line_1149'>thronged him.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had</a>
<a id='line_1152'>spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>8:44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and</a>
<a id='line_1154'>immediately her issue of blood stanched.</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they</a>
<a id='line_1157'>that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press</a>
<a id='line_1158'>thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  8:46 And Jesus said, Somebody</a>
<a id='line_1159'>hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,</a>
<a id='line_1162'>and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the</a>
<a id='line_1163'>people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed</a>
<a id='line_1164'>immediately.</a>
<a id='line_1165'></a>
<a id='line_1166'>8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith</a>
<a id='line_1167'>hath made thee whole; go in peace.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>8:49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the</a>
<a id='line_1170'>synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not</a>
<a id='line_1171'>the Master.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>8:50 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:</a>
<a id='line_1174'>believe only, and she shall be made whole.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>8:51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,</a>
<a id='line_1177'>save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the</a>
<a id='line_1178'>maiden.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not</a>
<a id='line_1181'>dead, but sleepeth.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</a>
<a id='line_1184'></a>
<a id='line_1185'>8:54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,</a>
<a id='line_1186'>saying, Maid, arise.</a>
<a id='line_1187'></a>
<a id='line_1188'>8:55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he</a>
<a id='line_1189'>commanded to give her meat.</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>8:56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they</a>
<a id='line_1192'>should tell no man what was done.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>9:1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power</a>
<a id='line_1195'>and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>9:2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the</a>
<a id='line_1198'>sick.</a>
<a id='line_1199'></a>
<a id='line_1200'>9:3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither</a>
<a id='line_1201'>staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two</a>
<a id='line_1202'>coats apiece.</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>9:4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence</a>
<a id='line_1205'>depart.</a>
<a id='line_1206'></a>
<a id='line_1207'>9:5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,</a>
<a id='line_1208'>shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</a>
<a id='line_1209'></a>
<a id='line_1210'>9:6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the</a>
<a id='line_1211'>gospel, and healing every where.</a>
<a id='line_1212'></a>
<a id='line_1213'>9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he</a>
<a id='line_1214'>was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen</a>
<a id='line_1215'>from the dead; 9:8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of</a>
<a id='line_1216'>others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</a>
<a id='line_1217'></a>
<a id='line_1218'>9:9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I</a>
<a id='line_1219'>hear such things? And he desired to see him.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>9:10 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they</a>
<a id='line_1222'>had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert</a>
<a id='line_1223'>place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>9:11 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received</a>
<a id='line_1226'>them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that</a>
<a id='line_1227'>had need of healing.</a>
<a id='line_1228'></a>
<a id='line_1229'>9:12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and</a>
<a id='line_1230'>said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the</a>
<a id='line_1231'>towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are</a>
<a id='line_1232'>here in a desert place.</a>
<a id='line_1233'></a>
<a id='line_1234'>9:13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We</a>
<a id='line_1235'>have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and</a>
<a id='line_1236'>buy meat for all this people.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>9:14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his</a>
<a id='line_1239'>disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>
<a id='line_1241'>9:15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.</a>
<a id='line_1242'></a>
<a id='line_1243'>9:16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up</a>
<a id='line_1244'>to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to</a>
<a id='line_1245'>set before the multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1246'></a>
<a id='line_1247'>9:17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of</a>
<a id='line_1248'>fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</a>
<a id='line_1249'></a>
<a id='line_1250'>9:18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were</a>
<a id='line_1251'>with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</a>
<a id='line_1252'>9:19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and</a>
<a id='line_1253'>others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</a>
<a id='line_1254'></a>
<a id='line_1255'>9:20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering</a>
<a id='line_1256'>said, The Christ of God.</a>
<a id='line_1257'></a>
<a id='line_1258'>9:21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man</a>
<a id='line_1259'>that thing; 9:22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and</a>
<a id='line_1260'>be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain,</a>
<a id='line_1261'>and be raised the third day.</a>
<a id='line_1262'></a>
<a id='line_1263'>9:23 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him</a>
<a id='line_1264'>deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</a>
<a id='line_1265'></a>
<a id='line_1266'>9:24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever</a>
<a id='line_1267'>will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</a>
<a id='line_1268'></a>
<a id='line_1269'>9:25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and</a>
<a id='line_1270'>lose himself, or be cast away?  9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of</a>
<a id='line_1271'>me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he</a>
<a id='line_1272'>shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy</a>
<a id='line_1273'>angels.</a>
<a id='line_1274'></a>
<a id='line_1275'>9:27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which</a>
<a id='line_1276'>shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1277'></a>
<a id='line_1278'>9:28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he</a>
<a id='line_1279'>took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</a>
<a id='line_1280'></a>
<a id='line_1281'>9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and</a>
<a id='line_1282'>his raiment was white and glistering.</a>
<a id='line_1283'></a>
<a id='line_1284'>9:30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and</a>
<a id='line_1285'>Elias: 9:31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he</a>
<a id='line_1286'>should accomplish at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>9:32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and</a>
<a id='line_1289'>when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood</a>
<a id='line_1290'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_1291'></a>
<a id='line_1292'>9:33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto</a>
<a id='line_1293'>Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three</a>
<a id='line_1294'>tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not</a>
<a id='line_1295'>knowing what he said.</a>
<a id='line_1296'></a>
<a id='line_1297'>9:34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them:</a>
<a id='line_1298'>and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</a>
<a id='line_1299'></a>
<a id='line_1300'>9:35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my</a>
<a id='line_1301'>beloved Son: hear him.</a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'>9:36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept</a>
<a id='line_1304'>it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they</a>
<a id='line_1305'>had seen.</a>
<a id='line_1306'></a>
<a id='line_1307'>9:37 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come</a>
<a id='line_1308'>down from the hill, much people met him.</a>
<a id='line_1309'></a>
<a id='line_1310'>9:38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I</a>
<a id='line_1311'>beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</a>
<a id='line_1312'></a>
<a id='line_1313'>9:39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it</a>
<a id='line_1314'>teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth</a>
<a id='line_1315'>from him.</a>
<a id='line_1316'></a>
<a id='line_1317'>9:40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</a>
<a id='line_1318'></a>
<a id='line_1319'>9:41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,</a>
<a id='line_1320'>how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</a>
<a id='line_1321'></a>
<a id='line_1322'>9:42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare</a>
<a id='line_1323'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1324'></a>
<a id='line_1325'>And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and</a>
<a id='line_1326'>delivered him again to his father.</a>
<a id='line_1327'></a>
<a id='line_1328'>9:43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while</a>
<a id='line_1329'>they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto</a>
<a id='line_1330'>his disciples, 9:44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for</a>
<a id='line_1331'>the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,</a>
<a id='line_1334'>that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>9:46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be</a>
<a id='line_1337'>greatest.</a>
<a id='line_1338'></a>
<a id='line_1339'>9:47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>and set him by him, 9:48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive</a>
<a id='line_1341'>this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me</a>
<a id='line_1342'>receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the</a>
<a id='line_1343'>same shall be great.</a>
<a id='line_1344'></a>
<a id='line_1345'>9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils</a>
<a id='line_1346'>in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>9:50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not</a>
<a id='line_1349'>against us is for us.</a>
<a id='line_1350'></a>
<a id='line_1351'>9:51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be</a>
<a id='line_1352'>received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 9:52 And</a>
<a id='line_1353'>sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a</a>
<a id='line_1354'>village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'>9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he</a>
<a id='line_1357'>would go to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1358'></a>
<a id='line_1359'>9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume</a>
<a id='line_1361'>them, even as Elias did?  9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and</a>
<a id='line_1362'>said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to</a>
<a id='line_1365'>save them. And they went to another village.</a>
<a id='line_1366'></a>
<a id='line_1367'>9:57 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man</a>
<a id='line_1368'>said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>9:58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air</a>
<a id='line_1371'>have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</a>
<a id='line_1372'></a>
<a id='line_1373'>9:59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me</a>
<a id='line_1374'>first to go and bury my father.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>9:60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou</a>
<a id='line_1377'>and preach the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>9:61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first</a>
<a id='line_1380'>go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</a>
<a id='line_1381'></a>
<a id='line_1382'>9:62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the</a>
<a id='line_1383'>plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1384'></a>
<a id='line_1385'>10:1 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and</a>
<a id='line_1386'>sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,</a>
<a id='line_1387'>whither he himself would come.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>10:2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the</a>
<a id='line_1390'>labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he</a>
<a id='line_1391'>would send forth labourers into his harvest.</a>
<a id='line_1392'></a>
<a id='line_1393'>10:3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>10:4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by</a>
<a id='line_1396'>the way.</a>
<a id='line_1397'></a>
<a id='line_1398'>10:5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this</a>
<a id='line_1399'>house.</a>
<a id='line_1400'></a>
<a id='line_1401'>10:6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it:</a>
<a id='line_1402'>if not, it shall turn to you again.</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>10:7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as</a>
<a id='line_1405'>they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house</a>
<a id='line_1406'>to house.</a>
<a id='line_1407'></a>
<a id='line_1408'>10:8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such</a>
<a id='line_1409'>things as are set before you: 10:9 And heal the sick that are therein,</a>
<a id='line_1410'>and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'>10:10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go</a>
<a id='line_1413'>your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, 10:11 Even the</a>
<a id='line_1414'>very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against</a>
<a id='line_1415'>you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is</a>
<a id='line_1416'>come nigh unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1417'></a>
<a id='line_1418'>10:12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day</a>
<a id='line_1419'>for Sodom, than for that city.</a>
<a id='line_1420'></a>
<a id='line_1421'>10:13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the</a>
<a id='line_1422'>mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in</a>
<a id='line_1423'>you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and</a>
<a id='line_1424'>ashes.</a>
<a id='line_1425'></a>
<a id='line_1426'>10:14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the</a>
<a id='line_1427'>judgment, than for you.</a>
<a id='line_1428'></a>
<a id='line_1429'>10:15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be</a>
<a id='line_1430'>thrust down to hell.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>10:16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you</a>
<a id='line_1433'>despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</a>
<a id='line_1434'></a>
<a id='line_1435'>10:17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the</a>
<a id='line_1436'>devils are subject unto us through thy name.</a>
<a id='line_1437'></a>
<a id='line_1438'>10:18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from</a>
<a id='line_1439'>heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1440'></a>
<a id='line_1441'>10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and</a>
<a id='line_1442'>scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by</a>
<a id='line_1443'>any means hurt you.</a>
<a id='line_1444'></a>
<a id='line_1445'>10:20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are</a>
<a id='line_1446'>subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written</a>
<a id='line_1447'>in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1448'></a>
<a id='line_1449'>10:21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O</a>
<a id='line_1450'>Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from</a>
<a id='line_1451'>the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so,</a>
<a id='line_1452'>Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</a>
<a id='line_1453'></a>
<a id='line_1454'>10:22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth</a>
<a id='line_1455'>who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son,</a>
<a id='line_1456'>and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</a>
<a id='line_1457'></a>
<a id='line_1458'>10:23 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,</a>
<a id='line_1459'>Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: 10:24 For I</a>
<a id='line_1460'>tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those</a>
<a id='line_1461'>things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things</a>
<a id='line_1462'>which ye hear, and have not heard them.</a>
<a id='line_1463'></a>
<a id='line_1464'>10:25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1465'>Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  10:26 He said unto</a>
<a id='line_1466'>him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?  10:27 And he</a>
<a id='line_1467'>answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</a>
<a id='line_1468'>and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy</a>
<a id='line_1469'>mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</a>
<a id='line_1470'></a>
<a id='line_1471'>10:28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and</a>
<a id='line_1472'>thou shalt live.</a>
<a id='line_1473'></a>
<a id='line_1474'>10:29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is</a>
<a id='line_1475'>my neighbour?  10:30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down</a>
<a id='line_1476'>from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him</a>
<a id='line_1477'>of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</a>
<a id='line_1478'></a>
<a id='line_1479'>10:31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and</a>
<a id='line_1480'>when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</a>
<a id='line_1481'></a>
<a id='line_1482'>10:32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked</a>
<a id='line_1483'>on him, and passed by on the other side.</a>
<a id='line_1484'></a>
<a id='line_1485'>10:33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and</a>
<a id='line_1486'>when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 10:34 And went to him, and</a>
<a id='line_1487'>bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own</a>
<a id='line_1488'>beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</a>
<a id='line_1489'></a>
<a id='line_1490'>10:35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and</a>
<a id='line_1491'>gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and</a>
<a id='line_1492'>whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</a>
<a id='line_1493'></a>
<a id='line_1494'>10:36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him</a>
<a id='line_1495'>that fell among the thieves?  10:37 And he said, He that shewed mercy</a>
<a id='line_1496'>on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</a>
<a id='line_1497'></a>
<a id='line_1498'>10:38 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a</a>
<a id='line_1499'>certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into</a>
<a id='line_1500'>her house.</a>
<a id='line_1501'></a>
<a id='line_1502'>10:39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,</a>
<a id='line_1503'>and heard his word.</a>
<a id='line_1504'></a>
<a id='line_1505'>10:40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and</a>
<a id='line_1506'>said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve</a>
<a id='line_1507'>alone?  bid her therefore that she help me.</a>
<a id='line_1508'></a>
<a id='line_1509'>10:41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art</a>
<a id='line_1510'>careful and troubled about many things: 10:42 But one thing is</a>
<a id='line_1511'>needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken</a>
<a id='line_1512'>away from her.</a>
<a id='line_1513'></a>
<a id='line_1514'>11:1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to</a>
<a id='line_1516'>pray, as John also taught his disciples.</a>
<a id='line_1517'></a>
<a id='line_1518'>11:2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in</a>
<a id='line_1519'>heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as</a>
<a id='line_1520'>in heaven, so in earth.</a>
<a id='line_1521'></a>
<a id='line_1522'>11:3 Give us day by day our daily bread.</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>11:4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is</a>
<a id='line_1525'>indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from</a>
<a id='line_1526'>evil.</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>11:5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and</a>
<a id='line_1529'>shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three</a>
<a id='line_1530'>loaves; 11:6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I</a>
<a id='line_1531'>have nothing to set before him?  11:7 And he from within shall answer</a>
<a id='line_1532'>and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are</a>
<a id='line_1533'>with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.</a>
<a id='line_1534'></a>
<a id='line_1535'>11:8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he</a>
<a id='line_1536'>is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give</a>
<a id='line_1537'>him as many as he needeth.</a>
<a id='line_1538'></a>
<a id='line_1539'>11:9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye</a>
<a id='line_1540'>shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1541'></a>
<a id='line_1542'>11:10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh</a>
<a id='line_1543'>findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</a>
<a id='line_1544'></a>
<a id='line_1545'>11:11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he</a>
<a id='line_1546'>give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a</a>
<a id='line_1547'>serpent?  11:12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a</a>
<a id='line_1548'>scorpion?  11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts</a>
<a id='line_1549'>unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the</a>
<a id='line_1550'>Holy Spirit to them that ask him?  11:14 And he was casting out a</a>
<a id='line_1551'>devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone</a>
<a id='line_1552'>out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>11:15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub</a>
<a id='line_1555'>the chief of the devils.</a>
<a id='line_1556'></a>
<a id='line_1557'>11:16 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1558'></a>
<a id='line_1559'>11:17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1560'>divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided</a>
<a id='line_1561'>against a house falleth.</a>
<a id='line_1562'></a>
<a id='line_1563'>11:18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1564'>stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</a>
<a id='line_1565'></a>
<a id='line_1566'>11:19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast</a>
<a id='line_1567'>them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</a>
<a id='line_1568'></a>
<a id='line_1569'>11:20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the</a>
<a id='line_1570'>kingdom of God is come upon you.</a>
<a id='line_1571'></a>
<a id='line_1572'>11:21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in</a>
<a id='line_1573'>peace: 11:22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_1574'>overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted,</a>
<a id='line_1575'>and divideth his spoils.</a>
<a id='line_1576'></a>
<a id='line_1577'>11:23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not</a>
<a id='line_1578'>with me scattereth.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>11:24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through</a>
<a id='line_1581'>dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return</a>
<a id='line_1582'>unto my house whence I came out.</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>11:25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</a>
<a id='line_1585'></a>
<a id='line_1586'>11:26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked</a>
<a id='line_1587'>than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state</a>
<a id='line_1588'>of that man is worse than the first.</a>
<a id='line_1589'></a>
<a id='line_1590'>11:27 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman</a>
<a id='line_1591'>of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the</a>
<a id='line_1592'>womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</a>
<a id='line_1593'></a>
<a id='line_1594'>11:28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of</a>
<a id='line_1595'>God, and keep it.</a>
<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>11:29 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to</a>
<a id='line_1598'>say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no</a>
<a id='line_1599'>sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</a>
<a id='line_1600'></a>
<a id='line_1601'>11:30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the</a>
<a id='line_1602'>Son of man be to this generation.</a>
<a id='line_1603'></a>
<a id='line_1604'>11:31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost</a>
<a id='line_1606'>parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a</a>
<a id='line_1607'>greater than Solomon is here.</a>
<a id='line_1608'></a>
<a id='line_1609'>11:32 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this</a>
<a id='line_1610'>generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching</a>
<a id='line_1611'>of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</a>
<a id='line_1612'></a>
<a id='line_1613'>11:33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret</a>
<a id='line_1614'>place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which</a>
<a id='line_1615'>come in may see the light.</a>
<a id='line_1616'></a>
<a id='line_1617'>11:34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is</a>
<a id='line_1618'>single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is</a>
<a id='line_1619'>evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</a>
<a id='line_1620'></a>
<a id='line_1621'>11:35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not</a>
<a id='line_1622'>darkness.</a>
<a id='line_1623'></a>
<a id='line_1624'>11:36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part</a>
<a id='line_1625'>dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of</a>
<a id='line_1626'>a candle doth give thee light.</a>
<a id='line_1627'></a>
<a id='line_1628'>11:37 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with</a>
<a id='line_1629'>him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>11:38 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first</a>
<a id='line_1632'>washed before dinner.</a>
<a id='line_1633'></a>
<a id='line_1634'>11:39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the</a>
<a id='line_1635'>outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of</a>
<a id='line_1636'>ravening and wickedness.</a>
<a id='line_1637'></a>
<a id='line_1638'>11:40 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that</a>
<a id='line_1639'>which is within also?  11:41 But rather give alms of such things as ye</a>
<a id='line_1640'>have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1641'></a>
<a id='line_1642'>11:42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all</a>
<a id='line_1643'>manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these</a>
<a id='line_1644'>ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</a>
<a id='line_1645'></a>
<a id='line_1646'>11:43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the</a>
<a id='line_1647'>synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>11:44 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as</a>
<a id='line_1650'>graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware</a>
<a id='line_1651'>of them.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>11:45 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,</a>
<a id='line_1654'>thus saying thou reproachest us also.</a>
<a id='line_1655'></a>
<a id='line_1656'>11:46 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with</a>
<a id='line_1657'>burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens</a>
<a id='line_1658'>with one of your fingers.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>11:47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and</a>
<a id='line_1661'>your fathers killed them.</a>
<a id='line_1662'></a>
<a id='line_1663'>11:48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:</a>
<a id='line_1664'>for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</a>
<a id='line_1665'></a>
<a id='line_1666'>11:49 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets</a>
<a id='line_1667'>and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: 11:50</a>
<a id='line_1668'>That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation</a>
<a id='line_1669'>of the world, may be required of this generation; 11:51 From the blood</a>
<a id='line_1670'>of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar</a>
<a id='line_1671'>and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this</a>
<a id='line_1672'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_1673'></a>
<a id='line_1674'>11:52 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of</a>
<a id='line_1675'>knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering</a>
<a id='line_1676'>in ye hindered.</a>
<a id='line_1677'></a>
<a id='line_1678'>11:53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the</a>
<a id='line_1679'>Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of</a>
<a id='line_1680'>many things: 11:54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something</a>
<a id='line_1681'>out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>12:1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an</a>
<a id='line_1684'>innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon</a>
<a id='line_1685'>another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of</a>
<a id='line_1686'>the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither</a>
<a id='line_1689'>hid, that shall not be known.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>12:3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in</a>
<a id='line_1692'>the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall</a>
<a id='line_1693'>be proclaimed upon the housetops.</a>
<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>12:4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill</a>
<a id='line_1696'>the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</a>
<a id='line_1697'></a>
<a id='line_1698'>12:5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after</a>
<a id='line_1699'>he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear</a>
<a id='line_1700'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them</a>
<a id='line_1703'>is forgotten before God?  12:7 But even the very hairs of your head</a>
<a id='line_1704'>are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many</a>
<a id='line_1705'>sparrows.</a>
<a id='line_1706'></a>
<a id='line_1707'>12:8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him</a>
<a id='line_1708'>shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 12:9 But</a>
<a id='line_1709'>he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of</a>
<a id='line_1710'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1711'></a>
<a id='line_1712'>12:10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it</a>
<a id='line_1713'>shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy</a>
<a id='line_1714'>Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</a>
<a id='line_1715'></a>
<a id='line_1716'>12:11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto</a>
<a id='line_1717'>magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1718'>answer, or what ye shall say: 12:12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you</a>
<a id='line_1719'>in the same hour what ye ought to say.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>12:13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my</a>
<a id='line_1722'>brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>12:14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over</a>
<a id='line_1725'>you?  12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of</a>
<a id='line_1726'>covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the</a>
<a id='line_1727'>things which he possesseth.</a>
<a id='line_1728'></a>
<a id='line_1729'>12:16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a</a>
<a id='line_1730'>certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 12:17 And he thought</a>
<a id='line_1731'>within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where</a>
<a id='line_1732'>to bestow my fruits?  12:18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull</a>
<a id='line_1733'>down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my</a>
<a id='line_1734'>fruits and my goods.</a>
<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up</a>
<a id='line_1737'>for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</a>
<a id='line_1738'></a>
<a id='line_1739'>12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be</a>
<a id='line_1740'>required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1741'>provided?  12:21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is</a>
<a id='line_1742'>not rich toward God.</a>
<a id='line_1743'></a>
<a id='line_1744'>12:22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take</a>
<a id='line_1745'>no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>what ye shall put on.</a>
<a id='line_1747'></a>
<a id='line_1748'>12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>12:24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which</a>
<a id='line_1751'>neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more</a>
<a id='line_1752'>are ye better than the fowls?  12:25 And which of you with taking</a>
<a id='line_1753'>thought can add to his stature one cubit?  12:26 If ye then be not</a>
<a id='line_1754'>able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the</a>
<a id='line_1755'>rest?  12:27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they</a>
<a id='line_1756'>spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was</a>
<a id='line_1757'>not arrayed like one of these.</a>
<a id='line_1758'></a>
<a id='line_1759'>12:28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>O ye of little faith?  12:29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or</a>
<a id='line_1762'>what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>12:30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and</a>
<a id='line_1765'>your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</a>
<a id='line_1766'></a>
<a id='line_1767'>12:31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things</a>
<a id='line_1768'>shall be added unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1769'></a>
<a id='line_1770'>12:32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to</a>
<a id='line_1771'>give you the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_1772'></a>
<a id='line_1773'>12:33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which</a>
<a id='line_1774'>wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no</a>
<a id='line_1775'>thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</a>
<a id='line_1776'></a>
<a id='line_1777'>12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</a>
<a id='line_1778'></a>
<a id='line_1779'>12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 12:36</a>
<a id='line_1780'>And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will</a>
<a id='line_1781'>return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may</a>
<a id='line_1782'>open unto him immediately.</a>
<a id='line_1783'></a>
<a id='line_1784'>12:37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall</a>
<a id='line_1785'>find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and</a>
<a id='line_1786'>make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>12:38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third</a>
<a id='line_1789'>watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</a>
<a id='line_1790'></a>
<a id='line_1791'>12:39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what</a>
<a id='line_1792'>hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have</a>
<a id='line_1793'>suffered his house to be broken through.</a>
<a id='line_1794'></a>
<a id='line_1795'>12:40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour</a>
<a id='line_1796'>when ye think not.</a>
<a id='line_1797'></a>
<a id='line_1798'>12:41 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto</a>
<a id='line_1799'>us, or even to all?  12:42 And the Lord said, Who then is that</a>
<a id='line_1800'>faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his</a>
<a id='line_1801'>household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?  12:43</a>
<a id='line_1802'>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so</a>
<a id='line_1803'>doing.</a>
<a id='line_1804'></a>
<a id='line_1805'>12:44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all</a>
<a id='line_1806'>that he hath.</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>12:45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his</a>
<a id='line_1809'>coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to</a>
<a id='line_1810'>eat and drink, and to be drunken; 12:46 The lord of that servant will</a>
<a id='line_1811'>come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is</a>
<a id='line_1812'>not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his</a>
<a id='line_1813'>portion with the unbelievers.</a>
<a id='line_1814'></a>
<a id='line_1815'>12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not</a>
<a id='line_1816'>himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many</a>
<a id='line_1817'>stripes.</a>
<a id='line_1818'></a>
<a id='line_1819'>12:48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,</a>
<a id='line_1820'>shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given,</a>
<a id='line_1821'>of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of</a>
<a id='line_1822'>him they will ask the more.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be</a>
<a id='line_1825'>already kindled?  12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and</a>
<a id='line_1826'>how am I straitened till it be accomplished!  12:51 Suppose ye that I</a>
<a id='line_1827'>am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:</a>
<a id='line_1828'>12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>three against two, and two against three.</a>
<a id='line_1830'></a>
<a id='line_1831'>12:53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against</a>
<a id='line_1832'>the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against</a>
<a id='line_1833'>the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the</a>
<a id='line_1834'>daughter in law against her mother in law.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>12:54 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of</a>
<a id='line_1837'>the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.</a>
<a id='line_1838'></a>
<a id='line_1839'>12:55 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;</a>
<a id='line_1840'>and it cometh to pass.</a>
<a id='line_1841'></a>
<a id='line_1842'>12:56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the</a>
<a id='line_1843'>earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?  12:57 Yea, and</a>
<a id='line_1844'>why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?  12:58 When thou</a>
<a id='line_1845'>goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale</a>
<a id='line_1847'>thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>officer cast thee into prison.</a>
<a id='line_1849'></a>
<a id='line_1850'>12:59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid</a>
<a id='line_1851'>the very last mite.</a>
<a id='line_1852'></a>
<a id='line_1853'>13:1 There were present at that season some that told him of the</a>
<a id='line_1854'>Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>13:2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these</a>
<a id='line_1857'>Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they</a>
<a id='line_1858'>suffered such things?  13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye</a>
<a id='line_1859'>shall all likewise perish.</a>
<a id='line_1860'></a>
<a id='line_1861'>13:4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew</a>
<a id='line_1862'>them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_1863'>Jerusalem?  13:5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all</a>
<a id='line_1864'>likewise perish.</a>
<a id='line_1865'></a>
<a id='line_1866'>13:6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted</a>
<a id='line_1867'>in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</a>
<a id='line_1868'></a>
<a id='line_1869'>13:7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these</a>
<a id='line_1870'>three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut</a>
<a id='line_1871'>it down; why cumbereth it the ground?  13:8 And he answering said unto</a>
<a id='line_1872'>him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and</a>
<a id='line_1873'>dung it: 13:9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that</a>
<a id='line_1874'>thou shalt cut it down.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>13:10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_1877'></a>
<a id='line_1878'>13:11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity</a>
<a id='line_1879'>eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up</a>
<a id='line_1880'>herself.</a>
<a id='line_1881'></a>
<a id='line_1882'>13:12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>13:13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made</a>
<a id='line_1886'>straight, and glorified God.</a>
<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>13:14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the</a>
<a id='line_1890'>people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them</a>
<a id='line_1891'>therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</a>
<a id='line_1892'></a>
<a id='line_1893'>13:15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not</a>
<a id='line_1894'>each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall,</a>
<a id='line_1895'>and lead him away to watering?  13:16 And ought not this woman, being</a>
<a id='line_1896'>a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen</a>
<a id='line_1897'>years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?  13:17 And when he</a>
<a id='line_1898'>had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the</a>
<a id='line_1899'>people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</a>
<a id='line_1900'></a>
<a id='line_1901'>13:18 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and</a>
<a id='line_1902'>whereunto shall I resemble it?  13:19 It is like a grain of mustard</a>
<a id='line_1903'>seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and</a>
<a id='line_1904'>waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of</a>
<a id='line_1905'>it.</a>
<a id='line_1906'></a>
<a id='line_1907'>13:20 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</a>
<a id='line_1908'>13:21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures</a>
<a id='line_1909'>of meal, till the whole was leavened.</a>
<a id='line_1910'></a>
<a id='line_1911'>13:22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and</a>
<a id='line_1912'>journeying toward Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1913'></a>
<a id='line_1914'>13:23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And</a>
<a id='line_1915'>he said unto them, 13:24 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for</a>
<a id='line_1916'>many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</a>
<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>13:25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to</a>
<a id='line_1919'>the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door,</a>
<a id='line_1920'>saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto</a>
<a id='line_1921'>you, I know you not whence ye are: 13:26 Then shall ye begin to say,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our</a>
<a id='line_1923'>streets.</a>
<a id='line_1924'></a>
<a id='line_1925'>13:27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;</a>
<a id='line_1926'>depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_1927'></a>
<a id='line_1928'>13:28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see</a>
<a id='line_1929'>Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1930'>God, and you yourselves thrust out.</a>
<a id='line_1931'></a>
<a id='line_1932'>13:29 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from</a>
<a id='line_1933'>the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1934'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1935'></a>
<a id='line_1936'>13:30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are</a>
<a id='line_1937'>first which shall be last.</a>
<a id='line_1938'></a>
<a id='line_1939'>13:31 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto</a>
<a id='line_1940'>him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.</a>
<a id='line_1941'></a>
<a id='line_1942'>13:32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast</a>
<a id='line_1943'>out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I</a>
<a id='line_1944'>shall be perfected.</a>
<a id='line_1945'></a>
<a id='line_1946'>13:33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day</a>
<a id='line_1947'>following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1948'></a>
<a id='line_1949'>13:34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest</a>
<a id='line_1950'>them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy</a>
<a id='line_1951'>children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and</a>
<a id='line_1952'>ye would not!  13:35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and</a>
<a id='line_1953'>verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when</a>
<a id='line_1954'>ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>14:1 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the</a>
<a id='line_1957'>chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched</a>
<a id='line_1958'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1959'></a>
<a id='line_1960'>14:2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the</a>
<a id='line_1961'>dropsy.</a>
<a id='line_1962'></a>
<a id='line_1963'>14:3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1964'>Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?  14:4 And they held their</a>
<a id='line_1965'>peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; 14:5 And</a>
<a id='line_1966'>answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen</a>
<a id='line_1967'>into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</a>
<a id='line_1968'>14:6 And they could not answer him again to these things.</a>
<a id='line_1969'></a>
<a id='line_1970'>14:7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he</a>
<a id='line_1971'>marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1972'></a>
<a id='line_1973'>14:8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the</a>
<a id='line_1974'>highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;</a>
<a id='line_1975'>14:9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man</a>
<a id='line_1976'>place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.</a>
<a id='line_1977'></a>
<a id='line_1978'>14:10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;</a>
<a id='line_1979'>that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go</a>
<a id='line_1980'>up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that</a>
<a id='line_1981'>sit at meat with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>14:11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that</a>
<a id='line_1984'>humbleth himself shall be exalted.</a>
<a id='line_1985'></a>
<a id='line_1986'>14:12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a</a>
<a id='line_1987'>dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither</a>
<a id='line_1988'>thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again,</a>
<a id='line_1989'>and a recompence be made thee.</a>
<a id='line_1990'></a>
<a id='line_1991'>14:13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the</a>
<a id='line_1992'>lame, the blind: 14:14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot</a>
<a id='line_1993'>recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of</a>
<a id='line_1994'>the just.</a>
<a id='line_1995'></a>
<a id='line_1996'>14:15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these</a>
<a id='line_1997'>things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the</a>
<a id='line_1998'>kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1999'></a>
<a id='line_2000'>14:16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and</a>
<a id='line_2001'>bade many: 14:17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them</a>
<a id='line_2002'>that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.</a>
<a id='line_2003'></a>
<a id='line_2004'>14:18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first</a>
<a id='line_2005'>said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go</a>
<a id='line_2006'>and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</a>
<a id='line_2007'></a>
<a id='line_2008'>14:19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to</a>
<a id='line_2009'>prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</a>
<a id='line_2010'></a>
<a id='line_2011'>14:20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot</a>
<a id='line_2012'>come.</a>
<a id='line_2013'></a>
<a id='line_2014'>14:21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the</a>
<a id='line_2015'>master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly</a>
<a id='line_2016'>into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor,</a>
<a id='line_2017'>and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.</a>
<a id='line_2018'></a>
<a id='line_2019'>14:22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,</a>
<a id='line_2020'>and yet there is room.</a>
<a id='line_2021'></a>
<a id='line_2022'>14:23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and</a>
<a id='line_2023'>hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</a>
<a id='line_2024'></a>
<a id='line_2025'>14:24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden</a>
<a id='line_2026'>shall taste of my supper.</a>
<a id='line_2027'></a>
<a id='line_2028'>14:25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and</a>
<a id='line_2029'>said unto them, 14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea,</a>
<a id='line_2031'>and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</a>
<a id='line_2032'></a>
<a id='line_2033'>14:27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot</a>
<a id='line_2034'>be my disciple.</a>
<a id='line_2035'></a>
<a id='line_2036'>14:28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down</a>
<a id='line_2037'>first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</a>
<a id='line_2038'>14:29 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able</a>
<a id='line_2039'>to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, 14:30 Saying, This</a>
<a id='line_2040'>man began to build, and was not able to finish.</a>
<a id='line_2041'></a>
<a id='line_2042'>14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth</a>
<a id='line_2043'>not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to</a>
<a id='line_2044'>meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?  14:32 Or else,</a>
<a id='line_2045'>while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and</a>
<a id='line_2046'>desireth conditions of peace.</a>
<a id='line_2047'></a>
<a id='line_2048'>14:33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that</a>
<a id='line_2049'>he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</a>
<a id='line_2050'></a>
<a id='line_2051'>14:34 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith</a>
<a id='line_2052'>shall it be seasoned?  14:35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet</a>
<a id='line_2053'>for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let</a>
<a id='line_2054'>him hear.</a>
<a id='line_2055'></a>
<a id='line_2056'>15:1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear</a>
<a id='line_2057'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2058'></a>
<a id='line_2059'>15:2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man</a>
<a id='line_2060'>receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</a>
<a id='line_2061'></a>
<a id='line_2062'>15:3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 15:4 What man of</a>
<a id='line_2063'>you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave</a>
<a id='line_2064'>the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is</a>
<a id='line_2065'>lost, until he find it?  15:5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it</a>
<a id='line_2066'>on his shoulders, rejoicing.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>15:6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and</a>
<a id='line_2069'>neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my</a>
<a id='line_2070'>sheep which was lost.</a>
<a id='line_2071'></a>
<a id='line_2072'>15:7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one</a>
<a id='line_2073'>sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>which need no repentance.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>15:8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one</a>
<a id='line_2077'>piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek</a>
<a id='line_2078'>diligently till she find it?  15:9 And when she hath found it, she</a>
<a id='line_2079'>calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with</a>
<a id='line_2080'>me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.</a>
<a id='line_2081'></a>
<a id='line_2082'>15:10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_2083'>angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</a>
<a id='line_2084'></a>
<a id='line_2085'>15:11 And he said, A certain man had two sons: 15:12 And the younger</a>
<a id='line_2086'>of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that</a>
<a id='line_2087'>falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.</a>
<a id='line_2088'></a>
<a id='line_2089'>15:13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his</a>
<a id='line_2091'>substance with riotous living.</a>
<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>15:14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that</a>
<a id='line_2094'>land; and he began to be in want.</a>
<a id='line_2095'></a>
<a id='line_2096'>15:15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and</a>
<a id='line_2097'>he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</a>
<a id='line_2098'></a>
<a id='line_2099'>15:16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the</a>
<a id='line_2100'>swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</a>
<a id='line_2101'></a>
<a id='line_2102'>15:17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of</a>
<a id='line_2103'>my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</a>
<a id='line_2104'>15:18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,</a>
<a id='line_2105'>I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, 15:19 And am no more</a>
<a id='line_2106'>worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</a>
<a id='line_2107'></a>
<a id='line_2108'>15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a</a>
<a id='line_2109'>great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and</a>
<a id='line_2110'>fell on his neck, and kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_2111'></a>
<a id='line_2112'>15:21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,</a>
<a id='line_2113'>and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</a>
<a id='line_2114'></a>
<a id='line_2115'>15:22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,</a>
<a id='line_2116'>and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</a>
<a id='line_2117'>15:23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,</a>
<a id='line_2118'>and be merry: 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he</a>
<a id='line_2119'>was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</a>
<a id='line_2120'></a>
<a id='line_2121'>15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh</a>
<a id='line_2122'>to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>15:26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things</a>
<a id='line_2125'>meant.</a>
<a id='line_2126'></a>
<a id='line_2127'>15:27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath</a>
<a id='line_2128'>killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</a>
<a id='line_2129'></a>
<a id='line_2130'>15:28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father</a>
<a id='line_2131'>out, and intreated him.</a>
<a id='line_2132'></a>
<a id='line_2133'>15:29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I</a>
<a id='line_2134'>serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and</a>
<a id='line_2135'>yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my</a>
<a id='line_2136'>friends: 15:30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath</a>
<a id='line_2137'>devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted</a>
<a id='line_2138'>calf.</a>
<a id='line_2139'></a>
<a id='line_2140'>15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I</a>
<a id='line_2141'>have is thine.</a>
<a id='line_2142'></a>
<a id='line_2143'>15:32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy</a>
<a id='line_2144'>brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</a>
<a id='line_2145'></a>
<a id='line_2146'>16:1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich</a>
<a id='line_2147'>man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he</a>
<a id='line_2148'>had wasted his goods.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>16:2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this</a>
<a id='line_2151'>of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no</a>
<a id='line_2152'>longer steward.</a>
<a id='line_2153'></a>
<a id='line_2154'>16:3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my</a>
<a id='line_2155'>lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am</a>
<a id='line_2156'>ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_2157'></a>
<a id='line_2158'>16:4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the</a>
<a id='line_2159'>stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</a>
<a id='line_2160'></a>
<a id='line_2161'>16:5 So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him, and said</a>
<a id='line_2162'>unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?  16:6 And he said,</a>
<a id='line_2163'>An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and</a>
<a id='line_2164'>sit down quickly, and write fifty.</a>
<a id='line_2165'></a>
<a id='line_2166'>16:7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An</a>
<a id='line_2167'>hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and</a>
<a id='line_2168'>write fourscore.</a>
<a id='line_2169'></a>
<a id='line_2170'>16:8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done</a>
<a id='line_2171'>wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser</a>
<a id='line_2172'>than the children of light.</a>
<a id='line_2173'></a>
<a id='line_2174'>16:9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of</a>
<a id='line_2175'>unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into</a>
<a id='line_2176'>everlasting habitations.</a>
<a id='line_2177'></a>
<a id='line_2178'>16:10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in</a>
<a id='line_2179'>much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</a>
<a id='line_2180'></a>
<a id='line_2181'>16:11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous</a>
<a id='line_2182'>mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  16:12 And if</a>
<a id='line_2183'>ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall</a>
<a id='line_2184'>give you that which is your own?  16:13 No servant can serve two</a>
<a id='line_2185'>masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else</a>
<a id='line_2186'>he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God</a>
<a id='line_2187'>and mammon.</a>
<a id='line_2188'></a>
<a id='line_2189'>16:14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these</a>
<a id='line_2190'>things: and they derided him.</a>
<a id='line_2191'></a>
<a id='line_2192'>16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves</a>
<a id='line_2193'>before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly</a>
<a id='line_2194'>esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</a>
<a id='line_2195'></a>
<a id='line_2196'>16:16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the</a>
<a id='line_2197'>kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</a>
<a id='line_2198'></a>
<a id='line_2199'>16:17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle</a>
<a id='line_2200'>of the law to fail.</a>
<a id='line_2201'></a>
<a id='line_2202'>16:18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,</a>
<a id='line_2203'>committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from</a>
<a id='line_2204'>her husband committeth adultery.</a>
<a id='line_2205'></a>
<a id='line_2206'>16:19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and</a>
<a id='line_2207'>fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 16:20 And there was a</a>
<a id='line_2208'>certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of</a>
<a id='line_2209'>sores, 16:21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from</a>
<a id='line_2210'>the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</a>
<a id='line_2211'></a>
<a id='line_2212'>16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by</a>
<a id='line_2213'>the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was</a>
<a id='line_2214'>buried; 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and</a>
<a id='line_2215'>seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</a>
<a id='line_2216'></a>
<a id='line_2217'>16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and</a>
<a id='line_2218'>send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool</a>
<a id='line_2219'>my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</a>
<a id='line_2220'></a>
<a id='line_2221'>16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime</a>
<a id='line_2222'>receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now</a>
<a id='line_2223'>he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</a>
<a id='line_2224'></a>
<a id='line_2225'>16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf</a>
<a id='line_2226'>fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither</a>
<a id='line_2227'>can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</a>
<a id='line_2228'></a>
<a id='line_2229'>16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest</a>
<a id='line_2230'>send him to my father’s house: 16:28 For I have five brethren; that he</a>
<a id='line_2231'>may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</a>
<a id='line_2232'></a>
<a id='line_2233'>16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let</a>
<a id='line_2234'>them hear them.</a>
<a id='line_2235'></a>
<a id='line_2236'>16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from</a>
<a id='line_2237'>the dead, they will repent.</a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'>16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,</a>
<a id='line_2240'>neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_2241'></a>
<a id='line_2242'>17:1 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that</a>
<a id='line_2243'>offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!  17:2 It</a>
<a id='line_2244'>were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and</a>
<a id='line_2245'>he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little</a>
<a id='line_2246'>ones.</a>
<a id='line_2247'></a>
<a id='line_2248'>17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,</a>
<a id='line_2249'>rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</a>
<a id='line_2250'></a>
<a id='line_2251'>17:4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven</a>
<a id='line_2252'>times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2253'>forgive him.</a>
<a id='line_2254'></a>
<a id='line_2255'>17:5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</a>
<a id='line_2256'></a>
<a id='line_2257'>17:6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye</a>
<a id='line_2258'>might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and</a>
<a id='line_2259'>be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</a>
<a id='line_2260'></a>
<a id='line_2261'>17:7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,</a>
<a id='line_2262'>will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and</a>
<a id='line_2263'>sit down to meat?  17:8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready</a>
<a id='line_2264'>wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten</a>
<a id='line_2265'>and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?  17:9 Doth he</a>
<a id='line_2266'>thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?</a>
<a id='line_2267'>I trow not.</a>
<a id='line_2268'></a>
<a id='line_2269'>17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which</a>
<a id='line_2270'>are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done</a>
<a id='line_2271'>that which was our duty to do.</a>
<a id='line_2272'></a>
<a id='line_2273'>17:11 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed</a>
<a id='line_2274'>through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_2275'></a>
<a id='line_2276'>17:12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men</a>
<a id='line_2277'>that were lepers, which stood afar off: 17:13 And they lifted up their</a>
<a id='line_2278'>voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</a>
<a id='line_2279'></a>
<a id='line_2280'>17:14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto</a>
<a id='line_2281'>the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were</a>
<a id='line_2282'>cleansed.</a>
<a id='line_2283'></a>
<a id='line_2284'>17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,</a>
<a id='line_2285'>and with a loud voice glorified God, 17:16 And fell down on his face</a>
<a id='line_2286'>at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</a>
<a id='line_2287'></a>
<a id='line_2288'>17:17 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where</a>
<a id='line_2289'>are the nine?  17:18 There are not found that returned to give glory</a>
<a id='line_2290'>to God, save this stranger.</a>
<a id='line_2291'></a>
<a id='line_2292'>17:19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made</a>
<a id='line_2293'>thee whole.</a>
<a id='line_2294'></a>
<a id='line_2295'>17:20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_2296'>God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh</a>
<a id='line_2297'>not with observation: 17:21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo</a>
<a id='line_2298'>there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</a>
<a id='line_2299'></a>
<a id='line_2300'>17:22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye</a>
<a id='line_2301'>shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2302'>not see it.</a>
<a id='line_2303'></a>
<a id='line_2304'>17:23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after</a>
<a id='line_2305'>them, nor follow them.</a>
<a id='line_2306'></a>
<a id='line_2307'>17:24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under</a>
<a id='line_2308'>heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the</a>
<a id='line_2309'>Son of man be in his day.</a>
<a id='line_2310'></a>
<a id='line_2311'>17:25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this</a>
<a id='line_2312'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_2313'></a>
<a id='line_2314'>17:26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the</a>
<a id='line_2315'>days of the Son of man.</a>
<a id='line_2316'></a>
<a id='line_2317'>17:27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in</a>
<a id='line_2318'>marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood</a>
<a id='line_2319'>came, and destroyed them all.</a>
<a id='line_2320'></a>
<a id='line_2321'>17:28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they</a>
<a id='line_2322'>drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 17:29 But</a>
<a id='line_2323'>the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone</a>
<a id='line_2324'>from heaven, and destroyed them all.</a>
<a id='line_2325'></a>
<a id='line_2326'>17:30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is</a>
<a id='line_2327'>revealed.</a>
<a id='line_2328'></a>
<a id='line_2329'>17:31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff</a>
<a id='line_2330'>in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in</a>
<a id='line_2331'>the field, let him likewise not return back.</a>
<a id='line_2332'></a>
<a id='line_2333'>17:32 Remember Lot’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_2334'></a>
<a id='line_2335'>17:33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and</a>
<a id='line_2336'>whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</a>
<a id='line_2337'></a>
<a id='line_2338'>17:34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the</a>
<a id='line_2339'>one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</a>
<a id='line_2340'></a>
<a id='line_2341'>17:35 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,</a>
<a id='line_2342'>and the other left.</a>
<a id='line_2343'></a>
<a id='line_2344'>17:36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the</a>
<a id='line_2345'>other left.</a>
<a id='line_2346'></a>
<a id='line_2347'>17:37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said</a>
<a id='line_2348'>unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be</a>
<a id='line_2349'>gathered together.</a>
<a id='line_2350'></a>
<a id='line_2351'>18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought</a>
<a id='line_2352'>always to pray, and not to faint; 18:2 Saying, There was in a city a</a>
<a id='line_2353'>judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: 18:3 And there was</a>
<a id='line_2354'>a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine</a>
<a id='line_2355'>adversary.</a>
<a id='line_2356'></a>
<a id='line_2357'>18:4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within</a>
<a id='line_2358'>himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 18:5 Yet because this</a>
<a id='line_2359'>widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming</a>
<a id='line_2360'>she weary me.</a>
<a id='line_2361'></a>
<a id='line_2362'>18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</a>
<a id='line_2363'></a>
<a id='line_2364'>18:7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night</a>
<a id='line_2365'>unto him, though he bear long with them?  18:8 I tell you that he will</a>
<a id='line_2366'>avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall</a>
<a id='line_2367'>he find faith on the earth?  18:9 And he spake this parable unto</a>
<a id='line_2368'>certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and</a>
<a id='line_2369'>despised others: 18:10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the</a>
<a id='line_2370'>one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</a>
<a id='line_2371'></a>
<a id='line_2372'>18:11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank</a>
<a id='line_2373'>thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,</a>
<a id='line_2374'>adulterers, or even as this publican.</a>
<a id='line_2375'></a>
<a id='line_2376'>18:12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</a>
<a id='line_2377'></a>
<a id='line_2378'>18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much</a>
<a id='line_2379'>as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be</a>
<a id='line_2380'>merciful to me a sinner.</a>
<a id='line_2381'></a>
<a id='line_2382'>18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather</a>
<a id='line_2383'>than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased;</a>
<a id='line_2384'>and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</a>
<a id='line_2385'></a>
<a id='line_2386'>18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch</a>
<a id='line_2387'>them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</a>
<a id='line_2388'></a>
<a id='line_2389'>18:16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children</a>
<a id='line_2390'>to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_2391'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2392'></a>
<a id='line_2393'>18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_2394'>of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</a>
<a id='line_2395'></a>
<a id='line_2396'>18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I</a>
<a id='line_2397'>do to inherit eternal life?  18:19 And Jesus said unto him, Why</a>
<a id='line_2398'>callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</a>
<a id='line_2399'></a>
<a id='line_2400'>18:20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not</a>
<a id='line_2401'>kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and</a>
<a id='line_2402'>thy mother.</a>
<a id='line_2403'></a>
<a id='line_2404'>18:21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</a>
<a id='line_2405'></a>
<a id='line_2406'>18:22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest</a>
<a id='line_2407'>thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor,</a>
<a id='line_2408'>and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</a>
<a id='line_2409'></a>
<a id='line_2410'>18:23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very</a>
<a id='line_2411'>rich.</a>
<a id='line_2412'></a>
<a id='line_2413'>18:24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How</a>
<a id='line_2414'>hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</a>
<a id='line_2415'>18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than</a>
<a id='line_2416'>for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>18:26 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?  18:27 And</a>
<a id='line_2419'>he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with</a>
<a id='line_2420'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2421'></a>
<a id='line_2422'>18:28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</a>
<a id='line_2423'></a>
<a id='line_2424'>18:29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man</a>
<a id='line_2425'>that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,</a>
<a id='line_2426'>for the kingdom of God’s sake, 18:30 Who shall not receive manifold</a>
<a id='line_2427'>more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</a>
<a id='line_2428'></a>
<a id='line_2429'>18:31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we</a>
<a id='line_2430'>go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets</a>
<a id='line_2431'>concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>18:32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be</a>
<a id='line_2434'>mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 18:33 And they shall</a>
<a id='line_2435'>scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise</a>
<a id='line_2436'>again.</a>
<a id='line_2437'></a>
<a id='line_2438'>18:34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was</a>
<a id='line_2439'>hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>18:35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a</a>
<a id='line_2442'>certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 18:36 And hearing the</a>
<a id='line_2443'>multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</a>
<a id='line_2444'></a>
<a id='line_2445'>18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</a>
<a id='line_2446'></a>
<a id='line_2447'>18:38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on</a>
<a id='line_2448'>me.</a>
<a id='line_2449'></a>
<a id='line_2450'>18:39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his</a>
<a id='line_2451'>peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on</a>
<a id='line_2452'>me.</a>
<a id='line_2453'></a>
<a id='line_2454'>18:40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and</a>
<a id='line_2455'>when he was come near, he asked him, 18:41 Saying, What wilt thou that</a>
<a id='line_2456'>I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</a>
<a id='line_2457'></a>
<a id='line_2458'>18:42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved</a>
<a id='line_2459'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_2460'></a>
<a id='line_2461'>18:43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,</a>
<a id='line_2462'>glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto</a>
<a id='line_2463'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2464'></a>
<a id='line_2465'>19:1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_2466'></a>
<a id='line_2467'>19:2 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief</a>
<a id='line_2468'>among the publicans, and he was rich.</a>
<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>19:3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the</a>
<a id='line_2471'>press, because he was little of stature.</a>
<a id='line_2472'></a>
<a id='line_2473'>19:4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see</a>
<a id='line_2474'>him: for he was to pass that way.</a>
<a id='line_2475'></a>
<a id='line_2476'>19:5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and</a>
<a id='line_2477'>said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must</a>
<a id='line_2478'>abide at thy house.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>19:6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</a>
<a id='line_2481'></a>
<a id='line_2482'>19:7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone</a>
<a id='line_2483'>to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</a>
<a id='line_2484'></a>
<a id='line_2485'>19:8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the</a>
<a id='line_2486'>half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing</a>
<a id='line_2487'>from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</a>
<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>19:9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this</a>
<a id='line_2490'>house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_2491'></a>
<a id='line_2492'>19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was</a>
<a id='line_2493'>lost.</a>
<a id='line_2494'></a>
<a id='line_2495'>19:11 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,</a>
<a id='line_2496'>because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the</a>
<a id='line_2497'>kingdom of God should immediately appear.</a>
<a id='line_2498'></a>
<a id='line_2499'>19:12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to</a>
<a id='line_2500'>receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</a>
<a id='line_2501'></a>
<a id='line_2502'>19:13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,</a>
<a id='line_2503'>and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</a>
<a id='line_2504'></a>
<a id='line_2505'>19:14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,</a>
<a id='line_2506'>saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</a>
<a id='line_2507'></a>
<a id='line_2508'>19:15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received</a>
<a id='line_2509'>the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2510'>to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man</a>
<a id='line_2511'>had gained by trading.</a>
<a id='line_2512'></a>
<a id='line_2513'>19:16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten</a>
<a id='line_2514'>pounds.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>19:17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2517'>been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</a>
<a id='line_2518'></a>
<a id='line_2519'>19:18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five</a>
<a id='line_2520'>pounds.</a>
<a id='line_2521'></a>
<a id='line_2522'>19:19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</a>
<a id='line_2523'></a>
<a id='line_2524'>19:20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which</a>
<a id='line_2525'>I have kept laid up in a napkin: 19:21 For I feared thee, because thou</a>
<a id='line_2526'>art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and</a>
<a id='line_2527'>reapest that thou didst not sow.</a>
<a id='line_2528'></a>
<a id='line_2529'>19:22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,</a>
<a id='line_2530'>thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up</a>
<a id='line_2531'>that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 19:23 Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_2532'>then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might</a>
<a id='line_2533'>have required mine own with usury?  19:24 And he said unto them that</a>
<a id='line_2534'>stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten</a>
<a id='line_2535'>pounds.</a>
<a id='line_2536'></a>
<a id='line_2537'>19:25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)  19:26 For I</a>
<a id='line_2538'>say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from</a>
<a id='line_2539'>him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</a>
<a id='line_2540'></a>
<a id='line_2541'>19:27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over</a>
<a id='line_2542'>them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</a>
<a id='line_2543'></a>
<a id='line_2544'>19:28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to</a>
<a id='line_2545'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2546'></a>
<a id='line_2547'>19:29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and</a>
<a id='line_2548'>Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his</a>
<a id='line_2549'>disciples, 19:30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in</a>
<a id='line_2550'>the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet</a>
<a id='line_2551'>never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</a>
<a id='line_2552'></a>
<a id='line_2553'>19:31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say</a>
<a id='line_2554'>unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</a>
<a id='line_2555'></a>
<a id='line_2556'>19:32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had</a>
<a id='line_2557'>said unto them.</a>
<a id='line_2558'></a>
<a id='line_2559'>19:33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto</a>
<a id='line_2560'>them, Why loose ye the colt?  19:34 And they said, The Lord hath need</a>
<a id='line_2561'>of him.</a>
<a id='line_2562'></a>
<a id='line_2563'>19:35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon</a>
<a id='line_2564'>the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</a>
<a id='line_2565'></a>
<a id='line_2566'>19:36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</a>
<a id='line_2567'></a>
<a id='line_2568'>19:37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount</a>
<a id='line_2569'>of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and</a>
<a id='line_2570'>praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had</a>
<a id='line_2571'>seen; 19:38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2572'>Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>19:39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto</a>
<a id='line_2575'>him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</a>
<a id='line_2576'></a>
<a id='line_2577'>19:40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these</a>
<a id='line_2578'>should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>19:41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</a>
<a id='line_2581'>19:42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy</a>
<a id='line_2582'>day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from</a>
<a id='line_2583'>thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2584'></a>
<a id='line_2585'>19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast</a>
<a id='line_2586'>a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every</a>
<a id='line_2587'>side, 19:44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children</a>
<a id='line_2588'>within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;</a>
<a id='line_2589'>because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</a>
<a id='line_2590'></a>
<a id='line_2591'>19:45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that</a>
<a id='line_2592'>sold therein, and them that bought; 19:46 Saying unto them, It is</a>
<a id='line_2593'>written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of</a>
<a id='line_2594'>thieves.</a>
<a id='line_2595'></a>
<a id='line_2596'>19:47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the</a>
<a id='line_2597'>scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 19:48 And</a>
<a id='line_2598'>could not find what they might do: for all the people were very</a>
<a id='line_2599'>attentive to hear him.</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>20:1 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the</a>
<a id='line_2602'>people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and</a>
<a id='line_2603'>the scribes came upon him with the elders, 20:2 And spake unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2604'>saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is</a>
<a id='line_2605'>he that gave thee this authority?  20:3 And he answered and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2606'>them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: 20:4 The baptism</a>
<a id='line_2607'>of John, was it from heaven, or of men?  20:5 And they reasoned with</a>
<a id='line_2608'>themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why</a>
<a id='line_2609'>then believed ye him not?  20:6 But and if we say, Of men; all the</a>
<a id='line_2610'>people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</a>
<a id='line_2611'></a>
<a id='line_2612'>20:7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</a>
<a id='line_2613'></a>
<a id='line_2614'>20:8 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I</a>
<a id='line_2615'>do these things.</a>
<a id='line_2616'></a>
<a id='line_2617'>20:9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man</a>
<a id='line_2618'>planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a</a>
<a id='line_2619'>far country for a long time.</a>
<a id='line_2620'></a>
<a id='line_2621'>20:10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they</a>
<a id='line_2622'>should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat</a>
<a id='line_2623'>him, and sent him away empty.</a>
<a id='line_2624'></a>
<a id='line_2625'>20:11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and</a>
<a id='line_2626'>entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</a>
<a id='line_2627'></a>
<a id='line_2628'>20:12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast</a>
<a id='line_2629'>him out.</a>
<a id='line_2630'></a>
<a id='line_2631'>20:13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send</a>
<a id='line_2632'>my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</a>
<a id='line_2633'></a>
<a id='line_2634'>20:14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_2635'>saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance</a>
<a id='line_2636'>may be ours.</a>
<a id='line_2637'></a>
<a id='line_2638'>20:15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What</a>
<a id='line_2639'>therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?  20:16 He shall</a>
<a id='line_2640'>come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to</a>
<a id='line_2641'>others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</a>
<a id='line_2642'></a>
<a id='line_2643'>20:17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,</a>
<a id='line_2644'>The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of</a>
<a id='line_2645'>the corner?  20:18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be</a>
<a id='line_2646'>broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</a>
<a id='line_2647'></a>
<a id='line_2648'>20:19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to</a>
<a id='line_2649'>lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that</a>
<a id='line_2650'>he had spoken this parable against them.</a>
<a id='line_2651'></a>
<a id='line_2652'>20:20 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign</a>
<a id='line_2653'>themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so</a>
<a id='line_2654'>they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>20:21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and</a>
<a id='line_2657'>teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but</a>
<a id='line_2658'>teachest the way of God truly: 20:22 Is it lawful for us to give</a>
<a id='line_2659'>tribute unto Caesar, or no?  20:23 But he perceived their craftiness,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?  20:24 Shew me a penny. Whose</a>
<a id='line_2661'>image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.</a>
<a id='line_2662'></a>
<a id='line_2663'>20:25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things</a>
<a id='line_2664'>which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.</a>
<a id='line_2665'></a>
<a id='line_2666'>20:26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and</a>
<a id='line_2667'>they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</a>
<a id='line_2668'></a>
<a id='line_2669'>20:27 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there</a>
<a id='line_2670'>is any resurrection; and they asked him, 20:28 Saying, Master, Moses</a>
<a id='line_2671'>wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die</a>
<a id='line_2672'>without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up</a>
<a id='line_2673'>seed unto his brother.</a>
<a id='line_2674'></a>
<a id='line_2675'>20:29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,</a>
<a id='line_2676'>and died without children.</a>
<a id='line_2677'></a>
<a id='line_2678'>20:30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</a>
<a id='line_2679'></a>
<a id='line_2680'>20:31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and</a>
<a id='line_2681'>they left no children, and died.</a>
<a id='line_2682'></a>
<a id='line_2683'>20:32 Last of all the woman died also.</a>
<a id='line_2684'></a>
<a id='line_2685'>20:33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for</a>
<a id='line_2686'>seven had her to wife.</a>
<a id='line_2687'></a>
<a id='line_2688'>20:34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world</a>
<a id='line_2689'>marry, and are given in marriage: 20:35 But they which shall be</a>
<a id='line_2690'>accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the</a>
<a id='line_2691'>dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 20:36 Neither can they</a>
<a id='line_2692'>die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children</a>
<a id='line_2693'>of God, being the children of the resurrection.</a>
<a id='line_2694'></a>
<a id='line_2695'>20:37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,</a>
<a id='line_2696'>when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and</a>
<a id='line_2697'>the God of Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_2698'></a>
<a id='line_2699'>20:38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live</a>
<a id='line_2700'>unto him.</a>
<a id='line_2701'></a>
<a id='line_2702'>20:39 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2703'>well said.</a>
<a id='line_2704'></a>
<a id='line_2705'>20:40 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</a>
<a id='line_2706'></a>
<a id='line_2707'>20:41 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?</a>
<a id='line_2708'>20:42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said</a>
<a id='line_2709'>unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 20:43 Till I make thine</a>
<a id='line_2710'>enemies thy footstool.</a>
<a id='line_2711'></a>
<a id='line_2712'>20:44 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?  20:45</a>
<a id='line_2713'>Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</a>
<a id='line_2714'>20:46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and</a>
<a id='line_2715'>love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the</a>
<a id='line_2716'>synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; 20:47 Which devour widows’</a>
<a id='line_2717'>houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive</a>
<a id='line_2718'>greater damnation.</a>
<a id='line_2719'></a>
<a id='line_2720'>21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into</a>
<a id='line_2721'>the treasury.</a>
<a id='line_2722'></a>
<a id='line_2723'>21:2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two</a>
<a id='line_2724'>mites.</a>
<a id='line_2725'></a>
<a id='line_2726'>21:3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath</a>
<a id='line_2727'>cast in more than they all: 21:4 For all these have of their abundance</a>
<a id='line_2728'>cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in</a>
<a id='line_2729'>all the living that she had.</a>
<a id='line_2730'></a>
<a id='line_2731'>21:5 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly</a>
<a id='line_2732'>stones and gifts, he said, 21:6 As for these things which ye behold,</a>
<a id='line_2733'>the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone</a>
<a id='line_2734'>upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</a>
<a id='line_2735'></a>
<a id='line_2736'>21:7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things</a>
<a id='line_2737'>be?  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</a>
<a id='line_2738'>21:8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall</a>
<a id='line_2739'>come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye</a>
<a id='line_2740'>not therefore after them.</a>
<a id='line_2741'></a>
<a id='line_2742'>21:9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:</a>
<a id='line_2743'>for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and</a>
<a id='line_2744'>by.</a>
<a id='line_2745'></a>
<a id='line_2746'>21:10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and</a>
<a id='line_2747'>kingdom against kingdom: 21:11 And great earthquakes shall be in</a>
<a id='line_2748'>divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and</a>
<a id='line_2749'>great signs shall there be from heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2750'></a>
<a id='line_2751'>21:12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and</a>
<a id='line_2752'>persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons,</a>
<a id='line_2753'>being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_2754'></a>
<a id='line_2755'>21:13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>21:14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what</a>
<a id='line_2758'>ye shall answer: 21:15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which</a>
<a id='line_2759'>all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</a>
<a id='line_2760'></a>
<a id='line_2761'>21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and</a>
<a id='line_2762'>kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to</a>
<a id='line_2763'>death.</a>
<a id='line_2764'></a>
<a id='line_2765'>21:17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_2766'></a>
<a id='line_2767'>21:18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</a>
<a id='line_2768'></a>
<a id='line_2769'>21:19 In your patience possess ye your souls.</a>
<a id='line_2770'></a>
<a id='line_2771'>21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know</a>
<a id='line_2772'>that the desolation thereof is nigh.</a>
<a id='line_2773'></a>
<a id='line_2774'>21:21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let</a>
<a id='line_2775'>them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that</a>
<a id='line_2776'>are in the countries enter thereinto.</a>
<a id='line_2777'></a>
<a id='line_2778'>21:22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are</a>
<a id='line_2779'>written may be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>21:23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give</a>
<a id='line_2782'>suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land,</a>
<a id='line_2783'>and wrath upon this people.</a>
<a id='line_2784'></a>
<a id='line_2785'>21:24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led</a>
<a id='line_2786'>away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of</a>
<a id='line_2787'>the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_2788'></a>
<a id='line_2789'>21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the</a>
<a id='line_2790'>stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the</a>
<a id='line_2791'>sea and the waves roaring; 21:26 Men’s hearts failing them for fear,</a>
<a id='line_2792'>and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for</a>
<a id='line_2793'>the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</a>
<a id='line_2794'></a>
<a id='line_2795'>21:27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with</a>
<a id='line_2796'>power and great glory.</a>
<a id='line_2797'></a>
<a id='line_2798'>21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and</a>
<a id='line_2799'>lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</a>
<a id='line_2800'></a>
<a id='line_2801'>21:29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the</a>
<a id='line_2802'>trees; 21:30 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own</a>
<a id='line_2803'>selves that summer is now nigh at hand.</a>
<a id='line_2804'></a>
<a id='line_2805'>21:31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye</a>
<a id='line_2806'>that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</a>
<a id='line_2807'></a>
<a id='line_2808'>21:32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till</a>
<a id='line_2809'>all be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_2810'></a>
<a id='line_2811'>21:33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass</a>
<a id='line_2812'>away.</a>
<a id='line_2813'></a>
<a id='line_2814'>21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be</a>
<a id='line_2815'>overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,</a>
<a id='line_2816'>and so that day come upon you unawares.</a>
<a id='line_2817'></a>
<a id='line_2818'>21:35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face</a>
<a id='line_2819'>of the whole earth.</a>
<a id='line_2820'></a>
<a id='line_2821'>21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted</a>
<a id='line_2822'>worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to</a>
<a id='line_2823'>stand before the Son of man.</a>
<a id='line_2824'></a>
<a id='line_2825'>21:37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night</a>
<a id='line_2826'>he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of</a>
<a id='line_2827'>Olives.</a>
<a id='line_2828'></a>
<a id='line_2829'>21:38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the</a>
<a id='line_2830'>temple, for to hear him.</a>
<a id='line_2831'></a>
<a id='line_2832'>22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the</a>
<a id='line_2833'>Passover.</a>
<a id='line_2834'></a>
<a id='line_2835'>22:2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him;</a>
<a id='line_2836'>for they feared the people.</a>
<a id='line_2837'></a>
<a id='line_2838'>22:3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the</a>
<a id='line_2839'>number of the twelve.</a>
<a id='line_2840'></a>
<a id='line_2841'>22:4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and</a>
<a id='line_2842'>captains, how he might betray him unto them.</a>
<a id='line_2843'></a>
<a id='line_2844'>22:5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</a>
<a id='line_2845'></a>
<a id='line_2846'>22:6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them</a>
<a id='line_2847'>in the absence of the multitude.</a>
<a id='line_2848'></a>
<a id='line_2849'>22:7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be</a>
<a id='line_2850'>killed.</a>
<a id='line_2851'></a>
<a id='line_2852'>22:8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the</a>
<a id='line_2853'>passover, that we may eat.</a>
<a id='line_2854'></a>
<a id='line_2855'>22:9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?  22:10</a>
<a id='line_2856'>And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city,</a>
<a id='line_2857'>there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him</a>
<a id='line_2858'>into the house where he entereth in.</a>
<a id='line_2859'></a>
<a id='line_2860'>22:11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith</a>
<a id='line_2861'>unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover</a>
<a id='line_2862'>with my disciples?  22:12 And he shall shew you a large upper room</a>
<a id='line_2863'>furnished: there make ready.</a>
<a id='line_2864'></a>
<a id='line_2865'>22:13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made</a>
<a id='line_2866'>ready the passover.</a>
<a id='line_2867'></a>
<a id='line_2868'>22:14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles</a>
<a id='line_2869'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_2870'></a>
<a id='line_2871'>22:15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this</a>
<a id='line_2872'>passover with you before I suffer: 22:16 For I say unto you, I will</a>
<a id='line_2873'>not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_2874'></a>
<a id='line_2875'>22:17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and</a>
<a id='line_2876'>divide it among yourselves: 22:18 For I say unto you, I will not drink</a>
<a id='line_2877'>of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</a>
<a id='line_2878'></a>
<a id='line_2879'>22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto</a>
<a id='line_2880'>them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in</a>
<a id='line_2881'>remembrance of me.</a>
<a id='line_2882'></a>
<a id='line_2883'>22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new</a>
<a id='line_2884'>testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</a>
<a id='line_2885'></a>
<a id='line_2886'>22:21 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the</a>
<a id='line_2887'>table.</a>
<a id='line_2888'></a>
<a id='line_2889'>22:22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe</a>
<a id='line_2890'>unto that man by whom he is betrayed!  22:23 And they began to enquire</a>
<a id='line_2891'>among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</a>
<a id='line_2892'></a>
<a id='line_2893'>22:24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be</a>
<a id='line_2894'>accounted the greatest.</a>
<a id='line_2895'></a>
<a id='line_2896'>22:25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise</a>
<a id='line_2897'>lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are</a>
<a id='line_2898'>called benefactors.</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>
<a id='line_2900'>22:26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let</a>
<a id='line_2901'>him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</a>
<a id='line_2902'></a>
<a id='line_2903'>22:27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that</a>
<a id='line_2904'>serveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he</a>
<a id='line_2905'>that serveth.</a>
<a id='line_2906'></a>
<a id='line_2907'>22:28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</a>
<a id='line_2908'></a>
<a id='line_2909'>22:29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed</a>
<a id='line_2910'>unto me; 22:30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_2911'>and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2912'></a>
<a id='line_2913'>22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to</a>
<a id='line_2914'>have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 22:32 But I have prayed for</a>
<a id='line_2915'>thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen</a>
<a id='line_2916'>thy brethren.</a>
<a id='line_2917'></a>
<a id='line_2918'>22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both</a>
<a id='line_2919'>into prison, and to death.</a>
<a id='line_2920'></a>
<a id='line_2921'>22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this</a>
<a id='line_2922'>day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</a>
<a id='line_2923'></a>
<a id='line_2924'>22:35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,</a>
<a id='line_2925'>and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2926'></a>
<a id='line_2927'>22:36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him</a>
<a id='line_2928'>take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him</a>
<a id='line_2929'>sell his garment, and buy one.</a>
<a id='line_2930'></a>
<a id='line_2931'>22:37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be</a>
<a id='line_2932'>accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for</a>
<a id='line_2933'>the things concerning me have an end.</a>
<a id='line_2934'></a>
<a id='line_2935'>22:38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said</a>
<a id='line_2936'>unto them, It is enough.</a>
<a id='line_2937'></a>
<a id='line_2938'>22:39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of</a>
<a id='line_2939'>Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</a>
<a id='line_2940'></a>
<a id='line_2941'>22:40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye</a>
<a id='line_2942'>enter not into temptation.</a>
<a id='line_2943'></a>
<a id='line_2944'>22:41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled</a>
<a id='line_2945'>down, and prayed, 22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove</a>
<a id='line_2946'>this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</a>
<a id='line_2947'></a>
<a id='line_2948'>22:43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening</a>
<a id='line_2949'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2950'></a>
<a id='line_2951'>22:44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat</a>
<a id='line_2952'>was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_2953'></a>
<a id='line_2954'>22:45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,</a>
<a id='line_2955'>he found them sleeping for sorrow, 22:46 And said unto them, Why sleep</a>
<a id='line_2956'>ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</a>
<a id='line_2957'></a>
<a id='line_2958'>22:47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was</a>
<a id='line_2959'>called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto</a>
<a id='line_2960'>Jesus to kiss him.</a>
<a id='line_2961'></a>
<a id='line_2962'>22:48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man</a>
<a id='line_2963'>with a kiss?  22:49 When they which were about him saw what would</a>
<a id='line_2964'>follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</a>
<a id='line_2965'>22:50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut</a>
<a id='line_2966'>off his right ear.</a>
<a id='line_2967'></a>
<a id='line_2968'>22:51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched</a>
<a id='line_2969'>his ear, and healed him.</a>
<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>22:52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the</a>
<a id='line_2972'>temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as</a>
<a id='line_2973'>against a thief, with swords and staves?  22:53 When I was daily with</a>
<a id='line_2974'>you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is</a>
<a id='line_2975'>your hour, and the power of darkness.</a>
<a id='line_2976'></a>
<a id='line_2977'>22:54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high</a>
<a id='line_2978'>priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.</a>
<a id='line_2979'></a>
<a id='line_2980'>22:55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_2981'>were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</a>
<a id='line_2982'></a>
<a id='line_2983'>22:56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and</a>
<a id='line_2984'>earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</a>
<a id='line_2985'></a>
<a id='line_2986'>22:57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</a>
<a id='line_2987'></a>
<a id='line_2988'>22:58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art</a>
<a id='line_2989'>also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</a>
<a id='line_2990'></a>
<a id='line_2991'>22:59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently</a>
<a id='line_2992'>affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is</a>
<a id='line_2993'>a Galilaean.</a>
<a id='line_2994'></a>
<a id='line_2995'>22:60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And</a>
<a id='line_2996'>immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</a>
<a id='line_2997'></a>
<a id='line_2998'>22:61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered</a>
<a id='line_2999'>the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>thou shalt deny me thrice.</a>
<a id='line_3001'></a>
<a id='line_3002'>22:62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>22:63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</a>
<a id='line_3005'></a>
<a id='line_3006'>22:64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,</a>
<a id='line_3007'>and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?  22:65 And</a>
<a id='line_3008'>many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>22:66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the</a>
<a id='line_3011'>chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their</a>
<a id='line_3012'>council, saying, 22:67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto</a>
<a id='line_3013'>them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 22:68 And if I also ask you,</a>
<a id='line_3014'>ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</a>
<a id='line_3015'></a>
<a id='line_3016'>22:69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the</a>
<a id='line_3017'>power of God.</a>
<a id='line_3018'></a>
<a id='line_3019'>22:70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said</a>
<a id='line_3020'>unto them, Ye say that I am.</a>
<a id='line_3021'></a>
<a id='line_3022'>22:71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we</a>
<a id='line_3023'>ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'>23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</a>
<a id='line_3026'></a>
<a id='line_3027'>23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow</a>
<a id='line_3028'>perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar,</a>
<a id='line_3029'>saying that he himself is Christ a King.</a>
<a id='line_3030'></a>
<a id='line_3031'>23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And</a>
<a id='line_3032'>he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</a>
<a id='line_3033'></a>
<a id='line_3034'>23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find</a>
<a id='line_3035'>no fault in this man.</a>
<a id='line_3036'></a>
<a id='line_3037'>23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</a>
<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a</a>
<a id='line_3041'>Galilaean.</a>
<a id='line_3042'></a>
<a id='line_3043'>23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s</a>
<a id='line_3044'>jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_3045'>at that time.</a>
<a id='line_3046'></a>
<a id='line_3047'>23:8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was</a>
<a id='line_3048'>desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things</a>
<a id='line_3049'>of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</a>
<a id='line_3050'></a>
<a id='line_3051'>23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him</a>
<a id='line_3052'>nothing.</a>
<a id='line_3053'></a>
<a id='line_3054'>23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused</a>
<a id='line_3055'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,</a>
<a id='line_3058'>and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</a>
<a id='line_3059'></a>
<a id='line_3060'>23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:</a>
<a id='line_3061'>for before they were at enmity between themselves.</a>
<a id='line_3062'></a>
<a id='line_3063'>23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and</a>
<a id='line_3064'>the rulers and the people, 23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this</a>
<a id='line_3065'>man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having</a>
<a id='line_3066'>examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching</a>
<a id='line_3067'>those things whereof ye accuse him: 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I</a>
<a id='line_3068'>sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</a>
<a id='line_3069'></a>
<a id='line_3070'>23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</a>
<a id='line_3073'>23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and</a>
<a id='line_3074'>release unto us Barabbas: 23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in</a>
<a id='line_3075'>the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)  23:20 Pilate</a>
<a id='line_3076'>therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</a>
<a id='line_3077'></a>
<a id='line_3078'>23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</a>
<a id='line_3079'></a>
<a id='line_3080'>23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he</a>
<a id='line_3081'>done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise</a>
<a id='line_3082'>him, and let him go.</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might</a>
<a id='line_3085'>be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests</a>
<a id='line_3086'>prevailed.</a>
<a id='line_3087'></a>
<a id='line_3088'>23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</a>
<a id='line_3089'></a>
<a id='line_3090'>23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was</a>
<a id='line_3091'>cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to</a>
<a id='line_3092'>their will.</a>
<a id='line_3093'></a>
<a id='line_3094'>23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a</a>
<a id='line_3095'>Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,</a>
<a id='line_3096'>that he might bear it after Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_3097'></a>
<a id='line_3098'>23:27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,</a>
<a id='line_3099'>which also bewailed and lamented him.</a>
<a id='line_3100'></a>
<a id='line_3101'>23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep</a>
<a id='line_3102'>not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,</a>
<a id='line_3105'>Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps</a>
<a id='line_3106'>which never gave suck.</a>
<a id='line_3107'></a>
<a id='line_3108'>23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and</a>
<a id='line_3109'>to the hills, Cover us.</a>
<a id='line_3110'></a>
<a id='line_3111'>23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done</a>
<a id='line_3112'>in the dry?  23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led</a>
<a id='line_3113'>with him to be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_3114'></a>
<a id='line_3115'>23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,</a>
<a id='line_3116'>there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,</a>
<a id='line_3117'>and the other on the left.</a>
<a id='line_3118'></a>
<a id='line_3119'>23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what</a>
<a id='line_3120'>they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</a>
<a id='line_3121'></a>
<a id='line_3122'>23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them</a>
<a id='line_3123'>derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be</a>
<a id='line_3124'>Christ, the chosen of God.</a>
<a id='line_3125'></a>
<a id='line_3126'>23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering</a>
<a id='line_3127'>him vinegar, 23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save</a>
<a id='line_3128'>thyself.</a>
<a id='line_3129'></a>
<a id='line_3130'>23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of</a>
<a id='line_3131'>Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</a>
<a id='line_3132'></a>
<a id='line_3133'>23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,</a>
<a id='line_3134'>saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>
<a id='line_3136'>23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear</a>
<a id='line_3137'>God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?  23:41 And we indeed</a>
<a id='line_3138'>justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath</a>
<a id='line_3139'>done nothing amiss.</a>
<a id='line_3140'></a>
<a id='line_3141'>23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into</a>
<a id='line_3142'>thy kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_3143'></a>
<a id='line_3144'>23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt</a>
<a id='line_3145'>thou be with me in paradise.</a>
<a id='line_3146'></a>
<a id='line_3147'>23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over</a>
<a id='line_3148'>all the earth until the ninth hour.</a>
<a id='line_3149'></a>
<a id='line_3150'>23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in</a>
<a id='line_3151'>the midst.</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,</a>
<a id='line_3154'>into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up</a>
<a id='line_3155'>the ghost.</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,</a>
<a id='line_3158'>saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</a>
<a id='line_3159'></a>
<a id='line_3160'>23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding</a>
<a id='line_3161'>the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</a>
<a id='line_3162'></a>
<a id='line_3163'>23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from</a>
<a id='line_3164'>Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</a>
<a id='line_3165'></a>
<a id='line_3166'>23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he</a>
<a id='line_3167'>was a good man, and a just: 23:51 (The same had not consented to the</a>
<a id='line_3168'>counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews:</a>
<a id='line_3169'>who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_3170'></a>
<a id='line_3171'>23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_3172'></a>
<a id='line_3173'>23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a</a>
<a id='line_3174'>sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</a>
<a id='line_3175'></a>
<a id='line_3176'>23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</a>
<a id='line_3177'></a>
<a id='line_3178'>23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed</a>
<a id='line_3179'>after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</a>
<a id='line_3180'></a>
<a id='line_3181'>23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested</a>
<a id='line_3182'>the sabbath day according to the commandment.</a>
<a id='line_3183'></a>
<a id='line_3184'>24:1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,</a>
<a id='line_3185'>they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had</a>
<a id='line_3186'>prepared, and certain others with them.</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
<a id='line_3188'>24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</a>
<a id='line_3189'></a>
<a id='line_3190'>24:3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_3191'></a>
<a id='line_3192'>24:4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,</a>
<a id='line_3193'>behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 24:5 And as they</a>
<a id='line_3194'>were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto</a>
<a id='line_3195'>them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?  24:6 He is not here, but</a>
<a id='line_3196'>is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</a>
<a id='line_3197'>24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful</a>
<a id='line_3198'>men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</a>
<a id='line_3199'></a>
<a id='line_3200'>24:8 And they remembered his words, 24:9 And returned from the</a>
<a id='line_3201'>sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the</a>
<a id='line_3202'>rest.</a>
<a id='line_3203'></a>
<a id='line_3204'>24:10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,</a>
<a id='line_3205'>and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the</a>
<a id='line_3206'>apostles.</a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'>24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed</a>
<a id='line_3209'>them not.</a>
<a id='line_3210'></a>
<a id='line_3211'>24:12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,</a>
<a id='line_3212'>he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed,</a>
<a id='line_3213'>wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</a>
<a id='line_3214'></a>
<a id='line_3215'>24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called</a>
<a id='line_3216'>Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</a>
<a id='line_3217'></a>
<a id='line_3218'>24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</a>
<a id='line_3219'></a>
<a id='line_3220'>24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and</a>
<a id='line_3221'>reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</a>
<a id='line_3222'></a>
<a id='line_3223'>24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</a>
<a id='line_3224'></a>
<a id='line_3225'>24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these</a>
<a id='line_3226'>that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?  24:18 And the</a>
<a id='line_3227'>one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou</a>
<a id='line_3228'>only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are</a>
<a id='line_3229'>come to pass there in these days?  24:19 And he said unto them, What</a>
<a id='line_3230'>things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which</a>
<a id='line_3231'>was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</a>
<a id='line_3232'>24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be</a>
<a id='line_3233'>condemned to death, and have crucified him.</a>
<a id='line_3234'></a>
<a id='line_3235'>24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed</a>
<a id='line_3236'>Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these</a>
<a id='line_3237'>things were done.</a>
<a id='line_3238'></a>
<a id='line_3239'>24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,</a>
<a id='line_3240'>which were early at the sepulchre; 24:23 And when they found not his</a>
<a id='line_3241'>body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels,</a>
<a id='line_3242'>which said that he was alive.</a>
<a id='line_3243'></a>
<a id='line_3244'>24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</a>
<a id='line_3246'></a>
<a id='line_3247'>24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe</a>
<a id='line_3248'>all that the prophets have spoken: 24:26 Ought not Christ to have</a>
<a id='line_3249'>suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?  24:27 And</a>
<a id='line_3250'>beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all</a>
<a id='line_3251'>the scriptures the things concerning himself.</a>
<a id='line_3252'></a>
<a id='line_3253'>24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he</a>
<a id='line_3254'>made as though he would have gone further.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'>24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is</a>
<a id='line_3257'>toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with</a>
<a id='line_3258'>them.</a>
<a id='line_3259'></a>
<a id='line_3260'>24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread,</a>
<a id='line_3261'>and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</a>
<a id='line_3262'></a>
<a id='line_3263'>24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished</a>
<a id='line_3264'>out of their sight.</a>
<a id='line_3265'></a>
<a id='line_3266'>24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,</a>
<a id='line_3267'>while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the</a>
<a id='line_3268'>scriptures?  24:33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to</a>
<a id='line_3269'>Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were</a>
<a id='line_3270'>with them, 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared</a>
<a id='line_3271'>to Simon.</a>
<a id='line_3272'></a>
<a id='line_3273'>24:35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was</a>
<a id='line_3274'>known of them in breaking of bread.</a>
<a id='line_3275'></a>
<a id='line_3276'>24:36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_3277'>them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</a>
<a id='line_3278'></a>
<a id='line_3279'>24:37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they</a>
<a id='line_3280'>had seen a spirit.</a>
<a id='line_3281'></a>
<a id='line_3282'>24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts</a>
<a id='line_3283'>arise in your hearts?  24:39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I</a>
<a id='line_3284'>myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as</a>
<a id='line_3285'>ye see me have.</a>
<a id='line_3286'></a>
<a id='line_3287'>24:40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his</a>
<a id='line_3288'>feet.</a>
<a id='line_3289'></a>
<a id='line_3290'>24:41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said</a>
<a id='line_3291'>unto them, Have ye here any meat?  24:42 And they gave him a piece of</a>
<a id='line_3292'>a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</a>
<a id='line_3293'></a>
<a id='line_3294'>24:43 And he took it, and did eat before them.</a>
<a id='line_3295'></a>
<a id='line_3296'>24:44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto</a>
<a id='line_3297'>you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in</a>
<a id='line_3299'>the psalms, concerning me.</a>
<a id='line_3300'></a>
<a id='line_3301'>24:45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand</a>
<a id='line_3302'>the scriptures, 24:46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus</a>
<a id='line_3303'>it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</a>
<a id='line_3304'>24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in</a>
<a id='line_3305'>his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3306'></a>
<a id='line_3307'>24:48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</a>
<a id='line_3308'></a>
<a id='line_3309'>24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry</a>
<a id='line_3310'>ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on</a>
<a id='line_3311'>high.</a>
<a id='line_3312'></a>
<a id='line_3313'>24:50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his</a>
<a id='line_3314'>hands, and blessed them.</a>
<a id='line_3315'></a>
<a id='line_3316'>24:51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from</a>
<a id='line_3317'>them, and carried up into heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3318'></a>
<a id='line_3319'>24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great</a>
<a id='line_3320'>joy: 24:53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing</a>
<a id='line_3321'>God. Amen.</a>
