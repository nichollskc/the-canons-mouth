                    <a id='line_0'>The General Epistle of Jude</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them</a>
<a id='line_4'>that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,</a>
<a id='line_5'>and called: 1:2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common</a>
<a id='line_8'>salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you</a>
<a id='line_9'>that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once</a>
<a id='line_10'>delivered unto the saints.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of</a>
<a id='line_13'>old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of</a>
<a id='line_14'>our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our</a>
<a id='line_15'>Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:5 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,</a>
<a id='line_18'>how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_19'>afterward destroyed them that believed not.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their</a>
<a id='line_22'>own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness</a>
<a id='line_23'>unto the judgment of the great day.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like</a>
<a id='line_26'>manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange</a>
<a id='line_27'>flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of</a>
<a id='line_28'>eternal fire.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise</a>
<a id='line_31'>dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he</a>
<a id='line_34'>disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a</a>
<a id='line_35'>railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but</a>
<a id='line_38'>what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they</a>
<a id='line_39'>corrupt themselves.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran</a>
<a id='line_42'>greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the</a>
<a id='line_43'>gainsaying of Core.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with</a>
<a id='line_46'>you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water,</a>
<a id='line_47'>carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit,</a>
<a id='line_48'>twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 1:13 Raging waves of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_49'>foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the</a>
<a id='line_50'>blackness of darkness for ever.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,</a>
<a id='line_53'>saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 1:15</a>
<a id='line_54'>To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly</a>
<a id='line_55'>among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly</a>
<a id='line_56'>committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have</a>
<a id='line_57'>spoken against him.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;</a>
<a id='line_60'>and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having menâ€™s persons in</a>
<a id='line_61'>admiration because of advantage.</a>
<a id='line_62'></a>
<a id='line_63'>1:17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of</a>
<a id='line_64'>the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 1:18 How that they told you</a>
<a id='line_65'>there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their</a>
<a id='line_66'>own ungodly lusts.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>1:19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the</a>
<a id='line_69'>Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,</a>
<a id='line_72'>praying in the Holy Ghost, 1:21 Keep yourselves in the love of God,</a>
<a id='line_73'>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>1:22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23 And others</a>
<a id='line_76'>save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment</a>
<a id='line_77'>spotted by the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>1:24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to</a>
<a id='line_80'>present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding</a>
<a id='line_81'>joy, 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,</a>
<a id='line_82'>dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</a>
