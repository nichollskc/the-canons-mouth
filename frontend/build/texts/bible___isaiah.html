<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning</a>
<a id='line_4'>Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,</a>
<a id='line_5'>kings of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken,</a>
<a id='line_8'>I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled</a>
<a id='line_9'>against me.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but</a>
<a id='line_12'>Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of</a>
<a id='line_15'>evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_16'>they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone</a>
<a id='line_17'>away backward.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:5 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more:</a>
<a id='line_20'>the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness</a>
<a id='line_23'>in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not</a>
<a id='line_24'>been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:7 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your</a>
<a id='line_27'>land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as</a>
<a id='line_28'>overthrown by strangers.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a</a>
<a id='line_31'>lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>1:9 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we</a>
<a id='line_34'>should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the</a>
<a id='line_37'>law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?</a>
<a id='line_40'>saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat</a>
<a id='line_41'>of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of</a>
<a id='line_42'>lambs, or of he goats.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your</a>
<a id='line_45'>hand, to tread my courts?  1:13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense</a>
<a id='line_46'>is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of</a>
<a id='line_47'>assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn</a>
<a id='line_48'>meeting.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are</a>
<a id='line_51'>a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from</a>
<a id='line_54'>you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are</a>
<a id='line_55'>full of blood.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from</a>
<a id='line_58'>before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 1:17 Learn to do well; seek</a>
<a id='line_59'>judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the</a>
<a id='line_60'>widow.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your</a>
<a id='line_63'>sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red</a>
<a id='line_64'>like crimson, they shall be as wool.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</a>
<a id='line_67'>1:20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:</a>
<a id='line_68'>for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>1:21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of</a>
<a id='line_71'>judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>1:22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 1:23 Thy</a>
<a id='line_74'>princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth</a>
<a id='line_75'>gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless,</a>
<a id='line_76'>neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>1:24 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of</a>
<a id='line_79'>Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine</a>
<a id='line_80'>enemies: 1:25 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away</a>
<a id='line_81'>thy dross, and take away all thy tin: 1:26 And I will restore thy</a>
<a id='line_82'>judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning:</a>
<a id='line_83'>afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the</a>
<a id='line_84'>faithful city.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>1:27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with</a>
<a id='line_87'>righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>1:28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall</a>
<a id='line_90'>be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>1:29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and</a>
<a id='line_93'>ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>1:30 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that</a>
<a id='line_96'>hath no water.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>1:31 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark,</a>
<a id='line_99'>and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and</a>
<a id='line_102'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>2:2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_105'>the LORD’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and</a>
<a id='line_106'>shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>2:3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the</a>
<a id='line_109'>mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will</a>
<a id='line_110'>teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion</a>
<a id='line_111'>shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>2:4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many</a>
<a id='line_114'>people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their</a>
<a id='line_115'>spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against</a>
<a id='line_116'>nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the</a>
<a id='line_119'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,</a>
<a id='line_122'>because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like</a>
<a id='line_123'>the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of</a>
<a id='line_124'>strangers.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>2:7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any</a>
<a id='line_127'>end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is</a>
<a id='line_128'>there any end of their chariots: 2:8 Their land also is full of idols;</a>
<a id='line_129'>they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers</a>
<a id='line_130'>have made: 2:9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man</a>
<a id='line_131'>humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>2:10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the</a>
<a id='line_134'>LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of</a>
<a id='line_137'>men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that</a>
<a id='line_138'>day.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:12 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is</a>
<a id='line_141'>proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be</a>
<a id='line_142'>brought low: 2:13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high</a>
<a id='line_143'>and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 2:14 And upon all the</a>
<a id='line_144'>high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up, 2:15 And</a>
<a id='line_145'>upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 2:16 And upon all</a>
<a id='line_146'>the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness</a>
<a id='line_149'>of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that</a>
<a id='line_150'>day.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>2:18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>2:19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves</a>
<a id='line_155'>of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty,</a>
<a id='line_156'>when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>2:20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols</a>
<a id='line_159'>of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles</a>
<a id='line_160'>and to the bats; 2:21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the</a>
<a id='line_161'>tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of</a>
<a id='line_162'>his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>2:22 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein</a>
<a id='line_165'>is he to be accounted of ?  3:1 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_166'>hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the</a>
<a id='line_167'>staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>3:2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,</a>
<a id='line_170'>and the prudent, and the ancient, 3:3 The captain of fifty, and the</a>
<a id='line_171'>honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the</a>
<a id='line_172'>eloquent orator.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:4 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule</a>
<a id='line_175'>over them.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>3:5 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every</a>
<a id='line_178'>one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against</a>
<a id='line_179'>the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his</a>
<a id='line_182'>father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this</a>
<a id='line_183'>ruin be under thy hand: 3:7 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will</a>
<a id='line_184'>not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make</a>
<a id='line_185'>me not a ruler of the people.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>3:8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue</a>
<a id='line_188'>and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his</a>
<a id='line_189'>glory.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>3:9 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they</a>
<a id='line_192'>declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for</a>
<a id='line_193'>they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>3:10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they</a>
<a id='line_196'>shall eat the fruit of their doings.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>3:11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of</a>
<a id='line_199'>his hands shall be given him.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule</a>
<a id='line_202'>over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and</a>
<a id='line_203'>destroy the way of thy paths.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>3:13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>3:14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his</a>
<a id='line_208'>people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard;</a>
<a id='line_209'>the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>3:15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the</a>
<a id='line_212'>faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>3:16 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are</a>
<a id='line_215'>haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking</a>
<a id='line_216'>and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 3:17</a>
<a id='line_217'>Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the</a>
<a id='line_218'>daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>3:18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling</a>
<a id='line_221'>ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires</a>
<a id='line_222'>like the moon, 3:19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</a>
<a id='line_223'>3:20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,</a>
<a id='line_224'>and the tablets, and the earrings, 3:21 The rings, and nose jewels,</a>
<a id='line_225'>3:22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the</a>
<a id='line_226'>wimples, and the crisping pins, 3:23 The glasses, and the fine linen,</a>
<a id='line_227'>and the hoods, and the vails.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>3:24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there</a>
<a id='line_230'>shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well</a>
<a id='line_231'>set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;</a>
<a id='line_232'>and burning instead of beauty.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>3:25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>3:26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate</a>
<a id='line_237'>shall sit upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>4:1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We</a>
<a id='line_240'>will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be</a>
<a id='line_241'>called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>4:2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and</a>
<a id='line_244'>glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for</a>
<a id='line_245'>them that are escaped of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>4:3 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he</a>
<a id='line_248'>that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that</a>
<a id='line_249'>is written among the living in Jerusalem: 4:4 When the Lord shall have</a>
<a id='line_250'>washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged</a>
<a id='line_251'>the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_252'>judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>4:5 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion,</a>
<a id='line_255'>and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of</a>
<a id='line_256'>a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>4:6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from</a>
<a id='line_259'>the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and</a>
<a id='line_260'>from rain.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>5:1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching</a>
<a id='line_263'>his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</a>
<a id='line_264'>5:2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted</a>
<a id='line_265'>it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and</a>
<a id='line_266'>also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring</a>
<a id='line_267'>forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>5:3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I</a>
<a id='line_270'>pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>5:4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not</a>
<a id='line_273'>done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth</a>
<a id='line_274'>grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  5:5 And now go to; I will tell</a>
<a id='line_275'>you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof,</a>
<a id='line_276'>and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it</a>
<a id='line_277'>shall be trodden down: 5:6 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be</a>
<a id='line_278'>pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will</a>
<a id='line_279'>also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_282'>the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but</a>
<a id='line_283'>behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>5:8 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,</a>
<a id='line_286'>till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_287'>the earth!  5:9 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many</a>
<a id='line_288'>houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>5:10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of</a>
<a id='line_291'>an homer shall yield an ephah.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>5:11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may</a>
<a id='line_294'>follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame</a>
<a id='line_295'>them!  5:12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and</a>
<a id='line_296'>wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_297'>neither consider the operation of his hands.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>5:13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no</a>
<a id='line_300'>knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude</a>
<a id='line_301'>dried up with thirst.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>5:14 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth</a>
<a id='line_304'>without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp,</a>
<a id='line_305'>and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>5:15 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall</a>
<a id='line_308'>be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: 5:16 But the</a>
<a id='line_309'>LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall</a>
<a id='line_310'>be sanctified in righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>5:17 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste</a>
<a id='line_313'>places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>5:18 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as</a>
<a id='line_316'>it were with a cart rope: 5:19 That say, Let him make speed, and</a>
<a id='line_317'>hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_318'>One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!  5:20 Woe unto</a>
<a id='line_319'>them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light,</a>
<a id='line_320'>and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for</a>
<a id='line_321'>bitter!  5:21 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and</a>
<a id='line_322'>prudent in their own sight!  5:22 Woe unto them that are mighty to</a>
<a id='line_323'>drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: 5:23 Which</a>
<a id='line_324'>justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the</a>
<a id='line_325'>righteous from him!  5:24 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble,</a>
<a id='line_326'>and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as</a>
<a id='line_327'>rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have</a>
<a id='line_328'>cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the</a>
<a id='line_329'>Holy One of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>5:25 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,</a>
<a id='line_332'>and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten</a>
<a id='line_333'>them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the</a>
<a id='line_334'>midst of the streets.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched</a>
<a id='line_337'>out still.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>5:26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will</a>
<a id='line_340'>hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come</a>
<a id='line_341'>with speed swiftly: 5:27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them;</a>
<a id='line_342'>none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins</a>
<a id='line_343'>be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: 5:28 Whose arrows</a>
<a id='line_344'>are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be</a>
<a id='line_345'>counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 5:29 Their</a>
<a id='line_346'>roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea,</a>
<a id='line_347'>they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away</a>
<a id='line_348'>safe, and none shall deliver it.</a>
<a id='line_349'></a>
<a id='line_350'>5:30 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of</a>
<a id='line_351'>the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_352'>and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>6:1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon</a>
<a id='line_355'>a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>6:2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain</a>
<a id='line_358'>he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with</a>
<a id='line_359'>twain he did fly.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>6:3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the</a>
<a id='line_362'>LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>6:4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,</a>
<a id='line_365'>and the house was filled with smoke.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>6:5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of</a>
<a id='line_368'>unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:</a>
<a id='line_369'>for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>6:6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his</a>
<a id='line_372'>hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 6:7 And he</a>
<a id='line_373'>laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and</a>
<a id='line_374'>thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>6:8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and</a>
<a id='line_377'>who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>6:9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but</a>
<a id='line_380'>understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</a>
<a id='line_381'></a>
<a id='line_382'>6:10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and</a>
<a id='line_383'>shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their</a>
<a id='line_384'>ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>6:11 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be</a>
<a id='line_387'>wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be</a>
<a id='line_388'>utterly desolate, 6:12 And the LORD have removed men far away, and</a>
<a id='line_389'>there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>6:13 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be</a>
<a id='line_392'>eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when</a>
<a id='line_393'>they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance</a>
<a id='line_394'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>7:1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son</a>
<a id='line_397'>of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the</a>
<a id='line_398'>son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war</a>
<a id='line_399'>against it, but could not prevail against it.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>7:2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate</a>
<a id='line_402'>with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as</a>
<a id='line_403'>the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>7:3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou,</a>
<a id='line_406'>and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool</a>
<a id='line_407'>in the highway of the fuller’s field; 7:4 And say unto him, Take heed,</a>
<a id='line_408'>and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of</a>
<a id='line_409'>these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,</a>
<a id='line_410'>and of the son of Remaliah.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>7:5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil</a>
<a id='line_413'>counsel against thee, saying, 7:6 Let us go up against Judah, and vex</a>
<a id='line_414'>it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the</a>
<a id='line_415'>midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: 7:7 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It</a>
<a id='line_416'>shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>7:8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is</a>
<a id='line_419'>Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken,</a>
<a id='line_420'>that it be not a people.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>7:9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is</a>
<a id='line_423'>Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be</a>
<a id='line_424'>established.</a>
<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>7:10 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 7:11 Ask thee a</a>
<a id='line_427'>sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height</a>
<a id='line_428'>above.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>7:12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>7:13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing</a>
<a id='line_433'>for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?  7:14 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_434'>the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall</a>
<a id='line_435'>conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>7:15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the</a>
<a id='line_438'>evil, and choose the good.</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>7:16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose</a>
<a id='line_441'>the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her</a>
<a id='line_442'>kings.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>7:17 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy</a>
<a id='line_445'>father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim</a>
<a id='line_446'>departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>7:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss</a>
<a id='line_449'>for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and</a>
<a id='line_450'>for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>7:19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate</a>
<a id='line_453'>valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon</a>
<a id='line_454'>all bushes.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>7:20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,</a>
<a id='line_457'>namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head,</a>
<a id='line_458'>and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>7:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a</a>
<a id='line_461'>young cow, and two sheep; 7:22 And it shall come to pass, for the</a>
<a id='line_462'>abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter</a>
<a id='line_463'>and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>7:23 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be,</a>
<a id='line_466'>where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall</a>
<a id='line_467'>even be for briers and thorns.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>7:24 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the</a>
<a id='line_470'>land shall become briers and thorns.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>7:25 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there</a>
<a id='line_473'>shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be</a>
<a id='line_474'>for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>8:1 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write</a>
<a id='line_477'>in it with a man’s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>8:2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,</a>
<a id='line_480'>and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>8:3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>8:4 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and</a>
<a id='line_487'>my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be</a>
<a id='line_488'>taken away before the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>8:5 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 8:6 Forasmuch as this</a>
<a id='line_491'>people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in</a>
<a id='line_492'>Rezin and Remaliah’s son; 8:7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth</a>
<a id='line_493'>up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king</a>
<a id='line_494'>of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his</a>
<a id='line_495'>channels, and go over all his banks: 8:8 And he shall pass through</a>
<a id='line_496'>Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck;</a>
<a id='line_497'>and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy</a>
<a id='line_498'>land, O Immanuel.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>8:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in</a>
<a id='line_501'>pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye</a>
<a id='line_502'>shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in</a>
<a id='line_503'>pieces.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>8:10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the</a>
<a id='line_506'>word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>8:11 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed</a>
<a id='line_509'>me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, 8:12 Say</a>
<a id='line_510'>ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A</a>
<a id='line_511'>confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>8:13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and</a>
<a id='line_514'>let him be your dread.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>8:14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and</a>
<a id='line_517'>for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for</a>
<a id='line_518'>a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>8:15 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and</a>
<a id='line_521'>be snared, and be taken.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>8:17 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the</a>
<a id='line_526'>house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>8:18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for</a>
<a id='line_529'>signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth</a>
<a id='line_530'>in mount Zion.</a>
<a id='line_531'></a>
<a id='line_532'>8:19 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have</a>
<a id='line_533'>familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should</a>
<a id='line_534'>not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?  8:20 To</a>
<a id='line_535'>the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this</a>
<a id='line_536'>word, it is because there is no light in them.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>8:21 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it</a>
<a id='line_539'>shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret</a>
<a id='line_540'>themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>8:22 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and</a>
<a id='line_543'>darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.</a>
<a id='line_544'></a>
<a id='line_545'>9:1 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,</a>
<a id='line_546'>when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the</a>
<a id='line_547'>land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the</a>
<a id='line_548'>way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>9:2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they</a>
<a id='line_551'>that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the</a>
<a id='line_552'>light shined.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>9:3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they</a>
<a id='line_555'>joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice</a>
<a id='line_556'>when they divide the spoil.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>9:4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his</a>
<a id='line_559'>shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>9:5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and</a>
<a id='line_562'>garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of</a>
<a id='line_563'>fire.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the</a>
<a id='line_566'>government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called</a>
<a id='line_567'>Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The</a>
<a id='line_568'>Prince of Peace.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>9:7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,</a>
<a id='line_571'>upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to</a>
<a id='line_572'>establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for</a>
<a id='line_573'>ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>9:8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.</a>
<a id='line_576'></a>
<a id='line_577'>9:9 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of</a>
<a id='line_578'>Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, 9:10 The bricks</a>
<a id='line_579'>are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are</a>
<a id='line_580'>cut down, but we will change them into cedars.</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>9:11 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against</a>
<a id='line_583'>him, and join his enemies together; 9:12 The Syrians before, and the</a>
<a id='line_584'>Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For</a>
<a id='line_585'>all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out</a>
<a id='line_586'>still.</a>
<a id='line_587'></a>
<a id='line_588'>9:13 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do</a>
<a id='line_589'>they seek the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_590'></a>
<a id='line_591'>9:14 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch</a>
<a id='line_592'>and rush, in one day.</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>9:15 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that</a>
<a id='line_595'>teacheth lies, he is the tail.</a>
<a id='line_596'></a>
<a id='line_597'>9:16 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that</a>
<a id='line_598'>are led of them are destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>9:17 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither</a>
<a id='line_601'>shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an</a>
<a id='line_602'>hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all</a>
<a id='line_603'>this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out</a>
<a id='line_604'>still.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>9:18 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers</a>
<a id='line_607'>and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they</a>
<a id='line_608'>shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>9:19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and</a>
<a id='line_611'>the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his</a>
<a id='line_612'>brother.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>9:20 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he</a>
<a id='line_615'>shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they</a>
<a id='line_616'>shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 9:21 Manasseh, Ephraim;</a>
<a id='line_617'>and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For</a>
<a id='line_618'>all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out</a>
<a id='line_619'>still.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>10:1 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write</a>
<a id='line_622'>grievousness which they have prescribed; 10:2 To turn aside the needy</a>
<a id='line_623'>from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people,</a>

<a id='line_1250'>20:3 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked</a>

<a id='line_1252'>Ethiopia; 20:4 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians</a>
<a id='line_1253'>prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and</a>
<a id='line_1254'>barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.</a>

<a id='line_1256'>20:5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their</a>

<a id='line_1262'>desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it</a>

<a id='line_1265'>21:2 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer</a>

<a id='line_1285'>watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 21:9</a>
<a id='line_1286'>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.</a>

<a id='line_1294'></a>
<a id='line_1295'>21:11 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,</a>
<a id='line_1296'>what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?  21:12 The watchman</a>
<a id='line_1297'>said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire,</a>

<a id='line_1307'>the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</a>
<a id='line_1308'></a>
<a id='line_1309'>21:16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to</a>

<a id='line_1323'></a>
<a id='line_1324'>22:4 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour</a>

<a id='line_1332'>22:6 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and</a>

<a id='line_1345'>22:10 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses</a>

<a id='line_1760'>the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried</a>

<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>28:17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the</a>

<a id='line_1767'></a>
<a id='line_1768'>28:18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your</a>

<a id='line_1779'>28:21 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be</a>

<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>28:27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,</a>

<a id='line_1864'>made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that</a>
<a id='line_1865'>framed it, He had no understanding?  29:17 Is it not yet a very little</a>
<a id='line_1866'>while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the</a>
<a id='line_1867'>fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?  29:18 And in that day</a>
<a id='line_1868'>shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind</a>

<a id='line_1986'>as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to</a>
<a id='line_1987'>sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle</a>

<a id='line_1990'>30:29 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is</a>

<a id='line_2014'>neither seek the LORD!  31:2 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil,</a>
<a id='line_2015'>and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of</a>

<a id='line_2017'></a>
<a id='line_2018'>31:3 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,</a>

<a id='line_2028'></a>
<a id='line_2029'>31:5 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;</a>

<a id='line_2039'></a>
<a id='line_2040'>31:8 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man;</a>

<a id='line_2043'></a>
<a id='line_2044'>31:9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his</a>

<a id='line_2292'></a>
<a id='line_2293'>36:1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that</a>
<a id='line_2294'>Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of</a>
<a id='line_2295'>Judah, and took them.</a>
<a id='line_2296'></a>
<a id='line_2297'>36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_2298'>unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of</a>
<a id='line_2299'>the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.</a>
<a id='line_2300'></a>
<a id='line_2301'>36:3 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over</a>
<a id='line_2302'>the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.</a>
<a id='line_2303'></a>
<a id='line_2304'>36:4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_2305'>the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein</a>
<a id='line_2306'>thou trustest?  36:5 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words)</a>
<a id='line_2307'>I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that</a>
<a id='line_2308'>thou rebellest against me?  36:6 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of</a>
<a id='line_2309'>this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his</a>
<a id='line_2310'>hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in</a>
<a id='line_2311'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2312'></a>
<a id='line_2313'>36:7 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not</a>
<a id='line_2314'>he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and</a>
<a id='line_2315'>said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</a>
<a id='line_2316'>36:8 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of</a>
<a id='line_2317'>Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on</a>
<a id='line_2318'>thy part to set riders upon them.</a>
<a id='line_2319'></a>
<a id='line_2320'>36:9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least</a>
<a id='line_2321'>of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and</a>
<a id='line_2322'>for horsemen?  36:10 And am I now come up without the LORD against</a>
<a id='line_2323'>this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this</a>
<a id='line_2324'>land, and destroy it.</a>
<a id='line_2325'></a>
<a id='line_2326'>36:11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I</a>
<a id='line_2327'>pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand</a>
<a id='line_2328'>it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the</a>
<a id='line_2329'>people that are on the wall.</a>
<a id='line_2330'></a>
<a id='line_2331'>36:12 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to</a>
<a id='line_2332'>thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit</a>
<a id='line_2333'>upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own</a>
<a id='line_2334'>piss with you?  36:13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud</a>
<a id='line_2335'>voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great</a>
<a id='line_2336'>king, the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_2337'></a>
<a id='line_2338'>36:14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall</a>
<a id='line_2339'>not be able to deliver you.</a>
<a id='line_2340'></a>
<a id='line_2341'>36:15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_2342'>LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the</a>
<a id='line_2343'>hand of the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_2344'></a>
<a id='line_2345'>36:16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,</a>
<a id='line_2346'>Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye</a>
<a id='line_2347'>every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye</a>
<a id='line_2348'>every one the waters of his own cistern; 36:17 Until I come and take</a>
<a id='line_2349'>you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land</a>
<a id='line_2350'>of bread and vineyards.</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>36:18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver</a>
<a id='line_2353'>us.</a>
<a id='line_2354'></a>
<a id='line_2355'>Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand</a>
<a id='line_2356'>of the king of Assyria?  36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and</a>
<a id='line_2357'>Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered</a>
<a id='line_2358'>Samaria out of my hand?  36:20 Who are they among all the gods of</a>
<a id='line_2359'>these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the</a>
<a id='line_2360'>LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?  36:21 But they held</a>
<a id='line_2361'>their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment</a>
<a id='line_2362'>was, saying, Answer him not.</a>
<a id='line_2363'></a>
<a id='line_2364'>36:22 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the</a>
<a id='line_2365'>household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the</a>
<a id='line_2366'>recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words</a>
<a id='line_2367'>of Rabshakeh.</a>
<a id='line_2368'></a>
<a id='line_2369'>37:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent</a>
<a id='line_2370'>his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the</a>
<a id='line_2371'>house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2372'></a>
<a id='line_2373'>37:2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the</a>
<a id='line_2374'>scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto</a>
<a id='line_2375'>Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</a>
<a id='line_2376'></a>
<a id='line_2377'>37:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of</a>
<a id='line_2378'>trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to</a>
<a id='line_2379'>the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</a>
<a id='line_2380'></a>
<a id='line_2381'>37:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom</a>
<a id='line_2382'>the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God,</a>
<a id='line_2383'>and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard:</a>
<a id='line_2384'>wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.</a>
<a id='line_2385'></a>
<a id='line_2386'>37:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</a>
<a id='line_2387'></a>
<a id='line_2388'>37:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,</a>
<a id='line_2389'>Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</a>
<a id='line_2391'></a>
<a id='line_2392'>37:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword</a>
<a id='line_2394'>in his own land.</a>
<a id='line_2395'></a>
<a id='line_2396'>37:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring</a>
<a id='line_2397'>against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</a>
<a id='line_2398'></a>
<a id='line_2399'>37:9 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come</a>
<a id='line_2400'>forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers</a>
<a id='line_2401'>to Hezekiah, saying, 37:10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of</a>
<a id='line_2402'>Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee,</a>
<a id='line_2403'>saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of</a>
<a id='line_2404'>Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_2405'></a>
<a id='line_2406'>37:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to</a>
<a id='line_2407'>all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</a>
<a id='line_2408'>37:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers</a>
<a id='line_2409'>have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of</a>
<a id='line_2410'>Eden which were in Telassar?  37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and</a>
<a id='line_2411'>the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and</a>
<a id='line_2412'>Ivah?  37:14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_2413'>messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the</a>
<a id='line_2414'>LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2415'></a>
<a id='line_2416'>37:15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 37:16 O LORD of</a>
<a id='line_2417'>hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art</a>
<a id='line_2418'>the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2419'>made heaven and earth.</a>
<a id='line_2420'></a>
<a id='line_2421'>37:17 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2422'>and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to</a>
<a id='line_2423'>reproach the living God.</a>
<a id='line_2424'></a>
<a id='line_2425'>37:18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the</a>
<a id='line_2426'>nations, and their countries, 37:19 And have cast their gods into the</a>
<a id='line_2427'>fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and</a>
<a id='line_2428'>stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</a>
<a id='line_2429'></a>
<a id='line_2430'>37:20 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all</a>
<a id='line_2431'>the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou</a>
<a id='line_2432'>only.</a>
<a id='line_2433'></a>
<a id='line_2434'>37:21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus</a>
<a id='line_2435'>saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against</a>
<a id='line_2436'>Sennacherib king of Assyria: 37:22 This is the word which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2437'>hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath</a>
<a id='line_2438'>despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_2439'>hath shaken her head at thee.</a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>37:23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast</a>
<a id='line_2442'>thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against</a>
<a id='line_2443'>the Holy One of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2444'></a>
<a id='line_2445'>37:24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By</a>
<a id='line_2446'>the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the</a>
<a id='line_2447'>mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall</a>
<a id='line_2448'>cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter</a>
<a id='line_2449'>into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.</a>
<a id='line_2450'></a>
<a id='line_2451'>37:25 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet</a>
<a id='line_2452'>have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</a>
<a id='line_2453'></a>
<a id='line_2454'>37:26 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient</a>
<a id='line_2455'>times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou</a>
<a id='line_2456'>shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.</a>
<a id='line_2457'></a>
<a id='line_2458'>37:27 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were</a>
<a id='line_2459'>dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as</a>
<a id='line_2460'>the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted</a>
<a id='line_2461'>before it be grown up.</a>
<a id='line_2462'></a>
<a id='line_2463'>37:28 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and</a>
<a id='line_2464'>thy rage against me.</a>
<a id='line_2465'></a>
<a id='line_2466'>37:29 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into</a>
<a id='line_2467'>mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in</a>
<a id='line_2468'>thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</a>
<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>37:30 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such</a>
<a id='line_2471'>as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the</a>
<a id='line_2472'>same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and</a>
<a id='line_2473'>eat the fruit thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2474'></a>
<a id='line_2475'>37:31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall</a>
<a id='line_2476'>again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: 37:32 For out of</a>
<a id='line_2477'>Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount</a>
<a id='line_2478'>Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>37:33 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He</a>
<a id='line_2481'>shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come</a>
<a id='line_2482'>before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</a>
<a id='line_2483'></a>
<a id='line_2484'>37:34 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall</a>
<a id='line_2485'>not come into this city, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2486'></a>
<a id='line_2487'>37:35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and</a>
<a id='line_2488'>for my servant David’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_2489'></a>
<a id='line_2490'>37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of</a>
<a id='line_2491'>the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they</a>
<a id='line_2492'>arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</a>
<a id='line_2493'></a>
<a id='line_2494'>37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,</a>
<a id='line_2495'>and dwelt at Nineveh.</a>
<a id='line_2496'></a>
<a id='line_2497'>37:38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of</a>
<a id='line_2498'>Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with</a>
<a id='line_2499'>the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon</a>
<a id='line_2500'>his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2501'></a>
<a id='line_2502'>38:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the</a>
<a id='line_2503'>prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_2504'>the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</a>
<a id='line_2505'></a>
<a id='line_2506'>38:2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto</a>
<a id='line_2507'>the LORD, 38:3 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I</a>
<a id='line_2508'>have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have</a>
<a id='line_2509'>done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</a>
<a id='line_2510'></a>
<a id='line_2511'>38:4 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 38:5 Go, and</a>
<a id='line_2512'>say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I</a>
<a id='line_2513'>have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto</a>
<a id='line_2514'>thy days fifteen years.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>38:6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king</a>
<a id='line_2517'>of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</a>
<a id='line_2518'></a>
<a id='line_2519'>38:7 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2520'>will do this thing that he hath spoken; 38:8 Behold, I will bring</a>
<a id='line_2521'>again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of</a>
<a id='line_2522'>Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which</a>
<a id='line_2523'>degrees it was gone down.</a>
<a id='line_2524'></a>
<a id='line_2525'>38:9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and</a>
<a id='line_2526'>was recovered of his sickness: 38:10 I said in the cutting off of my</a>
<a id='line_2527'>days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the</a>
<a id='line_2528'>residue of my years.</a>
<a id='line_2529'></a>
<a id='line_2530'>38:11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of</a>
<a id='line_2531'>the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the</a>
<a id='line_2532'>world.</a>
<a id='line_2533'></a>
<a id='line_2534'>38:12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s</a>
<a id='line_2535'>tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with</a>
<a id='line_2536'>pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</a>
<a id='line_2537'></a>
<a id='line_2538'>38:13 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all</a>
<a id='line_2539'>my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</a>
<a id='line_2540'></a>
<a id='line_2541'>38:14 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a</a>
<a id='line_2542'>dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed;</a>
<a id='line_2543'>undertake for me.</a>
<a id='line_2544'></a>
<a id='line_2545'>38:15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath</a>
<a id='line_2546'>done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</a>
<a id='line_2547'></a>
<a id='line_2548'>38:16 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the</a>
<a id='line_2549'>life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</a>
<a id='line_2550'></a>
<a id='line_2551'>38:17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love</a>
<a id='line_2552'>to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast</a>
<a id='line_2553'>all my sins behind thy back.</a>
<a id='line_2554'></a>
<a id='line_2555'>38:18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee:</a>
<a id='line_2556'>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</a>
<a id='line_2557'></a>
<a id='line_2558'>38:19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:</a>
<a id='line_2559'>the father to the children shall make known thy truth.</a>
<a id='line_2560'></a>
<a id='line_2561'>38:20 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs</a>
<a id='line_2562'>to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of</a>
<a id='line_2563'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2564'></a>
<a id='line_2565'>38:21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it</a>
<a id='line_2566'>for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.</a>
<a id='line_2567'></a>
<a id='line_2568'>38:22 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to</a>
<a id='line_2569'>the house of the LORD?  39:1 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of</a>
<a id='line_2570'>Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for</a>
<a id='line_2571'>he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</a>
<a id='line_2572'></a>
<a id='line_2573'>39:2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his</a>
<a id='line_2574'>precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the</a>
<a id='line_2575'>precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was</a>
<a id='line_2576'>found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his</a>
<a id='line_2577'>dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</a>
<a id='line_2578'></a>
<a id='line_2579'>39:3 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2580'>him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And</a>
<a id='line_2581'>Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from</a>
<a id='line_2582'>Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_2583'></a>
<a id='line_2584'>39:4 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah</a>
<a id='line_2585'>answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing</a>
<a id='line_2586'>among my treasures that I have not shewed them.</a>
<a id='line_2587'></a>
<a id='line_2588'>39:5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:</a>
<a id='line_2589'>39:6 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that</a>
<a id='line_2590'>which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be</a>
<a id='line_2591'>carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2592'></a>
<a id='line_2593'>39:7 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2594'>beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace</a>
<a id='line_2595'>of the king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_2596'></a>
<a id='line_2597'>39:8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which</a>
<a id='line_2598'>thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth</a>
<a id='line_2599'>in my days.</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>40:1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</a>
<a id='line_2602'></a>
<a id='line_2603'>40:2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her</a>
<a id='line_2604'>warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath</a>

<a id='line_2610'>40:4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall</a>

<a id='line_2613'>all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken</a>
<a id='line_2614'>it.</a>
<a id='line_2615'></a>
<a id='line_2616'>40:6 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is</a>

<a id='line_2620'></a>
<a id='line_2621'>40:8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God</a>

<a id='line_2627'>Judah, Behold your God!  40:10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with</a>

<a id='line_2638'>balance?  40:13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his</a>
<a id='line_2639'>counsellor hath taught him?  40:14 With whom took he counsel, and who</a>
<a id='line_2640'>instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him</a>
<a id='line_2641'>knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?  40:15 Behold,</a>
<a id='line_2642'>the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small</a>

<a id='line_3062'>that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;</a>
<a id='line_3063'>44:26 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the</a>
<a id='line_3064'>counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be</a>
<a id='line_3065'>inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will</a>
<a id='line_3066'>raise up the decayed places thereof: 44:27 That saith to the deep, Be</a>
<a id='line_3067'>dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 44:28 That saith of Cyrus, He is my</a>
<a id='line_3068'>shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_3069'>Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</a>
<a id='line_3070'></a>
<a id='line_3071'>45:1 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I</a>
<a id='line_3072'>have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins</a>
<a id='line_3073'>of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall</a>
<a id='line_3074'>not be shut; 45:2 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places</a>
<a id='line_3075'>straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder</a>
<a id='line_3076'>the bars of iron: 45:3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness,</a>
<a id='line_3077'>and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the</a>
<a id='line_3078'>LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3079'></a>
<a id='line_3080'>45:4 For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even</a>
<a id='line_3081'>called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not</a>
<a id='line_3082'>known me.</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>45:5 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me:</a>
<a id='line_3085'>I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 45:6 That they may know</a>
<a id='line_3086'>from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none</a>
<a id='line_3087'>beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.</a>
<a id='line_3088'></a>
<a id='line_3089'>45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create</a>
<a id='line_3090'>evil: I the LORD do all these things.</a>
<a id='line_3091'></a>
<a id='line_3092'>45:8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down</a>
<a id='line_3093'>righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation,</a>
<a id='line_3094'>and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>45:9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd</a>
<a id='line_3097'>strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that</a>
<a id='line_3098'>fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?  45:10</a>
<a id='line_3099'>Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to</a>
<a id='line_3100'>the woman, What hast thou brought forth?  45:11 Thus saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3101'>the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come</a>
<a id='line_3102'>concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>45:12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my</a>
<a id='line_3105'>hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I</a>
<a id='line_3106'>commanded.</a>
<a id='line_3107'></a>
<a id='line_3108'>45:13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his</a>

<a id='line_3110'>price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_3111'></a>
<a id='line_3112'>45:14 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of</a>
<a id='line_3113'>Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto</a>
<a id='line_3114'>thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains</a>
<a id='line_3115'>they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall</a>
<a id='line_3116'>make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there</a>
<a id='line_3117'>is none else, there is no God.</a>
<a id='line_3118'></a>
<a id='line_3119'>45:15 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the</a>
<a id='line_3120'>Saviour.</a>
<a id='line_3121'></a>
<a id='line_3122'>45:16 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they</a>
<a id='line_3123'>shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.</a>
<a id='line_3124'></a>
<a id='line_3125'>45:17 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting</a>
<a id='line_3126'>salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.</a>
<a id='line_3127'></a>
<a id='line_3128'>45:18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself</a>
<a id='line_3129'>that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created</a>
<a id='line_3130'>it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there</a>
<a id='line_3131'>is none else.</a>
<a id='line_3132'></a>
<a id='line_3133'>45:19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I</a>
<a id='line_3134'>said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak</a>
<a id='line_3135'>righteousness, I declare things that are right.</a>
<a id='line_3136'></a>
<a id='line_3137'>45:20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are</a>
<a id='line_3138'>escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of</a>
<a id='line_3139'>their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</a>
<a id='line_3140'></a>
<a id='line_3141'>45:21 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel</a>
<a id='line_3142'>together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it</a>
<a id='line_3143'>from that time?  have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside</a>
<a id='line_3144'>me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.</a>
<a id='line_3145'></a>
<a id='line_3146'>45:22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I</a>
<a id='line_3147'>am God, and there is none else.</a>
<a id='line_3148'></a>
<a id='line_3149'>45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in</a>
<a id='line_3150'>righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall</a>
<a id='line_3151'>bow, every tongue shall swear.</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>45:24 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and</a>
<a id='line_3154'>strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed</a>
<a id='line_3155'>against him shall be ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>45:25 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall</a>
<a id='line_3158'>glory.</a>

<a id='line_3160'>46:1 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts,</a>
<a id='line_3161'>and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a</a>
<a id='line_3162'>burden to the weary beast.</a>
<a id='line_3163'></a>
<a id='line_3164'>46:2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the</a>
<a id='line_3165'>burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.</a>
<a id='line_3166'></a>
<a id='line_3167'>46:3 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the</a>
<a id='line_3168'>house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are</a>
<a id='line_3169'>carried from the womb: 46:4 And even to your old age I am he; and even</a>
<a id='line_3170'>to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I</a>
<a id='line_3171'>will carry, and will deliver you.</a>
<a id='line_3172'></a>
<a id='line_3173'>46:5 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that</a>
<a id='line_3174'>we may be like?  46:6 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh</a>
<a id='line_3175'>silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god:</a>
<a id='line_3176'>they fall down, yea, they worship.</a>
<a id='line_3177'></a>
<a id='line_3178'>46:7 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in</a>
<a id='line_3179'>his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea,</a>

<a id='line_3181'>trouble.</a>
<a id='line_3182'></a>
<a id='line_3183'>46:8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O</a>
<a id='line_3184'>ye transgressors.</a>
<a id='line_3185'></a>
<a id='line_3186'>46:9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is</a>
<a id='line_3187'>none else; I am God, and there is none like me, 46:10 Declaring the</a>
<a id='line_3188'>end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not</a>
<a id='line_3189'>yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my</a>
<a id='line_3190'>pleasure: 46:11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that</a>
<a id='line_3191'>executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will</a>
<a id='line_3192'>also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.</a>
<a id='line_3193'></a>
<a id='line_3194'>46:12 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from</a>
<a id='line_3195'>righteousness: 46:13 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be</a>
<a id='line_3196'>far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation</a>
<a id='line_3197'>in Zion for Israel my glory.</a>
<a id='line_3198'></a>
<a id='line_3199'>47:1 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit</a>
<a id='line_3200'>on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for</a>
<a id='line_3201'>thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</a>
<a id='line_3202'></a>
<a id='line_3203'>47:2 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare</a>

<a id='line_3206'>47:3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I</a>

<a id='line_3209'>47:4 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One</a>

<a id='line_3211'></a>
<a id='line_3212'>47:5 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the</a>
<a id='line_3213'>Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</a>
<a id='line_3214'></a>
<a id='line_3215'>47:6 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and</a>
<a id='line_3216'>given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the</a>

<a id='line_3218'></a>
<a id='line_3219'>47:7 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst</a>

<a id='line_3222'></a>
<a id='line_3223'>47:8 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that</a>

<a id='line_3226'>of children: 47:9 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment</a>
<a id='line_3227'>in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon</a>
<a id='line_3228'>thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for</a>
<a id='line_3229'>the great abundance of thine enchantments.</a>
<a id='line_3230'></a>
<a id='line_3231'>47:10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None</a>
<a id='line_3232'>seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and</a>
<a id='line_3233'>thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.</a>
<a id='line_3234'></a>
<a id='line_3235'>47:11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from</a>

<a id='line_3238'>which thou shalt not know.</a>
<a id='line_3239'></a>
<a id='line_3240'>47:12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy</a>
<a id='line_3241'>sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou</a>
<a id='line_3242'>shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.</a>
<a id='line_3243'></a>
<a id='line_3244'>47:13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the</a>
<a id='line_3245'>astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up,</a>
<a id='line_3246'>and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_3247'></a>
<a id='line_3248'>47:14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they</a>

<a id='line_3252'>47:15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even</a>

<a id='line_3254'>quarter; none shall save thee.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'>48:1 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of</a>
<a id='line_3257'>Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by</a>
<a id='line_3258'>the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not</a>
<a id='line_3259'>in truth, nor in righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_3260'></a>
<a id='line_3261'>48:2 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves</a>

<a id='line_3263'></a>
<a id='line_3264'>48:3 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they</a>
<a id='line_3265'>went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_3266'>and they came to pass.</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
<a id='line_3268'>48:4 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron</a>
<a id='line_3269'>sinew, and thy brow brass; 48:5 I have even from the beginning</a>
<a id='line_3270'>declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest</a>
<a id='line_3271'>thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and</a>
<a id='line_3272'>my molten image, hath commanded them.</a>
<a id='line_3273'></a>
<a id='line_3274'>48:6 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have</a>

<a id='line_3277'></a>
<a id='line_3278'>48:7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the</a>
<a id='line_3279'>day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I</a>
<a id='line_3280'>knew them.</a>
<a id='line_3281'></a>
<a id='line_3282'>48:8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that</a>
<a id='line_3283'>time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal</a>
<a id='line_3284'>very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</a>
<a id='line_3285'></a>
<a id='line_3286'>48:9 For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise</a>
<a id='line_3287'>will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</a>
<a id='line_3288'></a>
<a id='line_3289'>48:10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen</a>

<a id='line_3291'></a>
<a id='line_3292'>48:11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how</a>

<a id='line_3294'></a>
<a id='line_3295'>48:12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am</a>
<a id='line_3296'>the first, I also am the last.</a>
<a id='line_3297'></a>
<a id='line_3298'>48:13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my</a>
<a id='line_3299'>right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand</a>

<a id='line_3301'></a>
<a id='line_3302'>48:14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath</a>
<a id='line_3303'>declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his</a>

<a id='line_3305'></a>
<a id='line_3306'>48:15 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought</a>

<a id='line_3308'></a>
<a id='line_3309'>48:16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret</a>
<a id='line_3310'>from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the</a>
<a id='line_3311'>Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</a>
<a id='line_3312'></a>
<a id='line_3313'>48:17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am</a>
<a id='line_3314'>the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by</a>
<a id='line_3315'>the way that thou shouldest go.</a>
<a id='line_3316'></a>
<a id='line_3317'>48:18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy</a>
<a id='line_3318'>peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</a>
<a id='line_3319'>48:19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy</a>
<a id='line_3320'>bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off</a>

<a id='line_3322'></a>
<a id='line_3323'>48:20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice</a>
<a id='line_3324'>of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the</a>
<a id='line_3325'>earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_3326'></a>
<a id='line_3327'>48:21 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he</a>
<a id='line_3328'>caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock</a>
<a id='line_3329'>also, and the waters gushed out.</a>
<a id='line_3330'></a>
<a id='line_3331'>48:22 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.</a>
<a id='line_3332'></a>
<a id='line_3333'>49:1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The</a>
<a id='line_3334'>LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath</a>
<a id='line_3335'>he made mention of my name.</a>
<a id='line_3336'></a>
<a id='line_3337'>49:2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of</a>
<a id='line_3338'>his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver</a>
<a id='line_3339'>hath he hid me; 49:3 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>in whom I will be glorified.</a>
<a id='line_3341'></a>
<a id='line_3342'>49:4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength</a>
<a id='line_3343'>for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_3344'>my work with my God.</a>
<a id='line_3345'></a>
<a id='line_3346'>49:5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his</a>
<a id='line_3347'>servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered,</a>
<a id='line_3348'>yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be</a>
<a id='line_3349'>my strength.</a>
<a id='line_3350'></a>
<a id='line_3351'>49:6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my</a>
<a id='line_3352'>servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved</a>
<a id='line_3353'>of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that</a>
<a id='line_3354'>thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</a>

<a id='line_3356'>49:7 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to</a>

<a id='line_3414'>Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my</a>

<a id='line_3418'>49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy</a>

<a id='line_3426'>delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and</a>

<a id='line_3434'>50:1 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother’s</a>

<a id='line_3558'>them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we</a>
<a id='line_3559'>may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the</a>

<a id='line_3592'></a>
<a id='line_3593'>52:10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the</a>

<a id='line_3610'>for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which</a>

<a id='line_3616'>when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</a>
<a id='line_3617'></a>
<a id='line_3618'>53:3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and</a>
<a id='line_3619'>acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he</a>

<a id='line_3621'></a>
<a id='line_3622'>53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we</a>
<a id='line_3623'>did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</a>
<a id='line_3624'></a>
<a id='line_3625'>53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our</a>

<a id='line_3628'></a>
<a id='line_3629'>53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to</a>

<a id='line_3631'></a>
<a id='line_3632'>53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his</a>

<a id='line_3635'></a>
<a id='line_3636'>53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare</a>

<a id='line_3638'>the transgression of my people was he stricken.</a>
<a id='line_3639'></a>
<a id='line_3640'>53:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his</a>

<a id='line_3643'></a>
<a id='line_3644'>53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:</a>
<a id='line_3645'>when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his</a>

<a id='line_3647'>prosper in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_3648'></a>
<a id='line_3649'>53:11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:</a>
<a id='line_3650'>by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall</a>

<a id='line_3652'></a>
<a id='line_3653'>53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he</a>

<a id='line_3681'>54:7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies</a>

<a id='line_3909'>58:9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry,</a>

<a id='line_3915'>satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be</a>
<a id='line_3916'>like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail</a>
<a id='line_3917'>not.</a>
<a id='line_3918'></a>
<a id='line_3919'>58:12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:</a>

<a id='line_3923'></a>
<a id='line_3924'>58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy</a>

<a id='line_3937'></a>
<a id='line_3938'>59:3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with</a>

<a id='line_3959'>goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein</a>
<a id='line_3960'>shall not know peace.</a>
<a id='line_3961'></a>
<a id='line_3962'>59:9 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake</a>
<a id='line_3963'>us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we</a>
<a id='line_3964'>walk in darkness.</a>
<a id='line_3965'></a>
<a id='line_3966'>59:10 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had</a>
<a id='line_3967'>no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate</a>

<a id='line_3969'></a>
<a id='line_3970'>59:11 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for</a>

<a id='line_3973'>59:12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins</a>
<a id='line_3974'>testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our</a>
<a id='line_3975'>iniquities, we know them; 59:13 In transgressing and lying against the</a>
<a id='line_3976'>LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt,</a>
<a id='line_3977'>conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</a>
<a id='line_3978'></a>
<a id='line_3979'>59:14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar</a>
<a id='line_3980'>off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</a>
<a id='line_3981'></a>
<a id='line_3982'>59:15 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh</a>
<a id='line_3983'>himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there</a>
<a id='line_3984'>was no judgment.</a>
<a id='line_3985'></a>
<a id='line_3986'>59:16 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no</a>
<a id='line_3987'>intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his</a>
<a id='line_3988'>righteousness, it sustained him.</a>
<a id='line_3989'></a>
<a id='line_3990'>59:17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of</a>
<a id='line_3991'>salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for</a>
<a id='line_3992'>clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</a>
<a id='line_3993'></a>
<a id='line_3994'>59:18 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his</a>

<a id='line_3996'>recompence.</a>
<a id='line_3997'></a>
<a id='line_3998'>59:19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his</a>
<a id='line_3999'>glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a</a>

<a id='line_4001'></a>
<a id='line_4002'>59:20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn</a>

<a id='line_4167'>the which thou hast laboured: 62:9 But they that have gathered it</a>

<a id='line_4190'>in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be</a>

<a id='line_4192'></a>
<a id='line_4193'>63:4 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my</a>

<a id='line_4199'></a>
<a id='line_4200'>63:6 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them</a>

<a id='line_4202'></a>
<a id='line_4203'>63:7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises</a>

<a id='line_4206'>on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of</a>
<a id='line_4207'>his lovingkindnesses.</a>
<a id='line_4208'></a>
<a id='line_4209'>63:8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not</a>

<a id='line_4212'>63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his</a>

<a id='line_4215'></a>
<a id='line_4216'>63:10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was</a>
<a id='line_4217'>turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</a>
<a id='line_4218'></a>
<a id='line_4219'>63:11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,</a>
<a id='line_4220'>saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the</a>
<a id='line_4221'>shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within</a>
<a id='line_4222'>him?  63:12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious</a>
<a id='line_4223'>arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting</a>
<a id='line_4224'>name?  63:13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the</a>
<a id='line_4225'>wilderness, that they should not stumble?  63:14 As a beast goeth down</a>
<a id='line_4226'>into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst</a>
<a id='line_4227'>thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</a>
<a id='line_4228'></a>
<a id='line_4229'>63:15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy</a>
<a id='line_4230'>holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the</a>
<a id='line_4231'>sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they</a>
<a id='line_4232'>restrained?  63:16 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be</a>
<a id='line_4233'>ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our</a>
<a id='line_4234'>father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.</a>
<a id='line_4235'></a>
<a id='line_4236'>63:17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened</a>
<a id='line_4237'>our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_4238'>thine inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_4239'></a>
<a id='line_4240'>63:18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while:</a>
<a id='line_4241'>our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</a>
<a id='line_4242'></a>

<a id='line_4249'>thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at</a>
<a id='line_4250'>thy presence!  64:3 When thou didst terrible things which we looked</a>
<a id='line_4251'>not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'>64:4 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor</a>

<a id='line_4256'></a>
<a id='line_4257'>64:5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those</a>

<a id='line_4261'>64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses</a>
<a id='line_4262'>are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities,</a>
<a id='line_4263'>like the wind, have taken us away.</a>
<a id='line_4264'></a>
<a id='line_4265'>64:7 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up</a>
<a id='line_4266'>himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and</a>
<a id='line_4267'>hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.</a>
<a id='line_4268'></a>
<a id='line_4269'>64:8 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou</a>
<a id='line_4270'>our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</a>
<a id='line_4271'></a>
<a id='line_4272'>64:9 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for</a>
<a id='line_4273'>ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</a>
<a id='line_4274'></a>
<a id='line_4275'>64:10 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_4276'>Jerusalem a desolation.</a>
<a id='line_4277'></a>
<a id='line_4278'>64:11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised</a>
<a id='line_4279'>thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid</a>
<a id='line_4280'>waste.</a>
<a id='line_4281'></a>
<a id='line_4282'>64:12 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_4283'>hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?  65:1 I am sought of them</a>
<a id='line_4284'>that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said,</a>
<a id='line_4285'>Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</a>
<a id='line_4286'></a>
<a id='line_4287'>65:2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,</a>
<a id='line_4288'>which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;</a>
<a id='line_4289'>65:3 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that</a>
<a id='line_4290'>sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 65:4</a>
<a id='line_4291'>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat</a>
<a id='line_4292'>swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</a>
<a id='line_4293'>65:5 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier</a>
<a id='line_4294'>than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the</a>
<a id='line_4295'>day.</a>
<a id='line_4296'></a>
<a id='line_4297'>65:6 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but</a>
<a id='line_4298'>will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 65:7 Your</a>
<a id='line_4299'>iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the</a>
<a id='line_4300'>LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me</a>
<a id='line_4301'>upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their</a>
<a id='line_4302'>bosom.</a>
<a id='line_4303'></a>
<a id='line_4304'>65:8 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and</a>
<a id='line_4305'>one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for</a>
<a id='line_4306'>my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</a>
<a id='line_4307'></a>
<a id='line_4308'>65:9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an</a>
<a id='line_4309'>inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my</a>
<a id='line_4310'>servants shall dwell there.</a>
<a id='line_4311'></a>
<a id='line_4312'>65:10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a</a>
<a id='line_4313'>place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</a>
<a id='line_4314'></a>
<a id='line_4315'>65:11 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy</a>
<a id='line_4316'>mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the</a>
<a id='line_4317'>drink offering unto that number.</a>
<a id='line_4318'></a>
<a id='line_4319'>65:12 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow</a>
<a id='line_4320'>down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when</a>
<a id='line_4321'>I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did</a>
<a id='line_4322'>choose that wherein I delighted not.</a>
<a id='line_4323'></a>
<a id='line_4324'>65:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall</a>
<a id='line_4325'>eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye</a>
<a id='line_4326'>shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_4327'>ashamed: 65:14 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye</a>
<a id='line_4328'>shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</a>
<a id='line_4329'></a>
<a id='line_4330'>65:15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the</a>
<a id='line_4331'>Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name: 65:16</a>
<a id='line_4332'>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the</a>
<a id='line_4333'>God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God</a>
<a id='line_4334'>of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they</a>
<a id='line_4335'>are hid from mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4336'></a>
<a id='line_4337'>65:17 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the</a>
<a id='line_4338'>former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</a>
<a id='line_4339'></a>
<a id='line_4340'>65:18 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,</a>
<a id='line_4341'>behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</a>
<a id='line_4342'></a>
<a id='line_4343'>65:19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the</a>
<a id='line_4344'>voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of</a>
<a id='line_4345'>crying.</a>
<a id='line_4346'></a>
<a id='line_4347'>65:20 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man</a>
<a id='line_4348'>that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred</a>
<a id='line_4349'>years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be</a>
<a id='line_4350'>accursed.</a>
<a id='line_4351'></a>
<a id='line_4352'>65:21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall</a>
<a id='line_4353'>plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</a>
<a id='line_4354'></a>
<a id='line_4355'>65:22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,</a>
<a id='line_4356'>and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people,</a>
<a id='line_4357'>and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</a>
<a id='line_4358'></a>
<a id='line_4359'>65:23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for</a>
<a id='line_4360'>they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with</a>
<a id='line_4361'>them.</a>
<a id='line_4362'></a>
<a id='line_4363'>65:24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;</a>
<a id='line_4364'>and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</a>
<a id='line_4365'></a>
<a id='line_4366'>65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall</a>
<a id='line_4367'>eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They</a>
<a id='line_4368'>shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4369'></a>
<a id='line_4370'>66:1 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my</a>
<a id='line_4371'>footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the</a>
<a id='line_4372'>place of my rest?  66:2 For all those things hath mine hand made, and</a>
<a id='line_4373'>all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I</a>
<a id='line_4374'>look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth</a>
<a id='line_4375'>at my word.</a>
<a id='line_4376'></a>
<a id='line_4377'>66:3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth</a>
<a id='line_4378'>a lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation,</a>
<a id='line_4379'>as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, as if he</a>
<a id='line_4380'>blessed an idol.</a>
<a id='line_4381'></a>
<a id='line_4382'>Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in</a>
<a id='line_4383'>their abominations.</a>
<a id='line_4384'></a>
<a id='line_4385'>66:4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears</a>
<a id='line_4386'>upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they</a>
<a id='line_4387'>did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in</a>
<a id='line_4388'>which I delighted not.</a>
<a id='line_4389'></a>
<a id='line_4390'>66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your</a>
<a id='line_4391'>brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said,</a>
<a id='line_4392'>Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they</a>
<a id='line_4393'>shall be ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_4394'></a>
<a id='line_4395'>66:6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice</a>
<a id='line_4396'>of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_4397'></a>
<a id='line_4398'>66:7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,</a>
<a id='line_4399'>she was delivered of a man child.</a>
<a id='line_4400'></a>
<a id='line_4401'>66:8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the</a>
<a id='line_4402'>earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at</a>
<a id='line_4403'>once?  for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</a>
<a id='line_4404'></a>
<a id='line_4405'>66:9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith</a>
<a id='line_4406'>the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy</a>
<a id='line_4407'>God.</a>
<a id='line_4408'></a>
<a id='line_4409'>66:10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that</a>
<a id='line_4410'>love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 66:11</a>
<a id='line_4411'>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her</a>
<a id='line_4412'>consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the</a>
<a id='line_4413'>abundance of her glory.</a>
<a id='line_4414'></a>
<a id='line_4415'>66:12 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like</a>
<a id='line_4416'>a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then</a>
<a id='line_4417'>shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon</a>
<a id='line_4418'>her knees.</a>
<a id='line_4419'></a>
<a id='line_4420'>66:13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye</a>
<a id='line_4421'>shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4422'></a>
<a id='line_4423'>66:14 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones</a>
<a id='line_4424'>shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known</a>
<a id='line_4425'>toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_4426'></a>
<a id='line_4427'>66:15 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots</a>
<a id='line_4428'>like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with</a>
<a id='line_4429'>flames of fire.</a>
<a id='line_4430'></a>
<a id='line_4431'>66:16 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh:</a>
<a id='line_4432'>and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</a>
<a id='line_4433'></a>
<a id='line_4434'>66:17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the</a>
<a id='line_4435'>gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the</a>
<a id='line_4436'>abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the</a>
<a id='line_4437'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4438'></a>
<a id='line_4439'>66:18 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I</a>
<a id='line_4440'>will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my</a>
<a id='line_4441'>glory.</a>
<a id='line_4442'></a>
<a id='line_4443'>66:19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that</a>
<a id='line_4444'>escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw</a>
<a id='line_4445'>the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not</a>
<a id='line_4446'>heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my</a>
<a id='line_4447'>glory among the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_4448'></a>
<a id='line_4449'>66:20 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the</a>
<a id='line_4450'>LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters,</a>
<a id='line_4451'>and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_4452'>saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean</a>
<a id='line_4453'>vessel into the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4454'></a>
<a id='line_4455'>66:21 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith</a>
<a id='line_4456'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4457'></a>
<a id='line_4458'>66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,</a>
<a id='line_4459'>shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your</a>
<a id='line_4460'>name remain.</a>
<a id='line_4461'></a>
<a id='line_4462'>66:23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,</a>
<a id='line_4463'>and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship</a>
<a id='line_4464'>before me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4465'></a>
<a id='line_4466'>66:24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men</a>
<a id='line_4467'>that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die,</a>
<a id='line_4468'>neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring</a>
<a id='line_4469'>unto all flesh.</a>
