<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>      When Justinian ascended the throne, about fifty years after the</a>
<a id='line_11'>      fall of the Western empire, the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals</a>
<a id='line_12'>      had obtained a solid, and, as it might seem, a legal</a>
<a id='line_13'>      establishment both in Europe and Africa. The titles, which Roman</a>
<a id='line_14'>      victory had inscribed, were erased with equal justice by the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      sword of the Barbarians; and their successful rapine derived a</a>
<a id='line_16'>      more venerable sanction from time, from treaties, and from the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      oaths of fidelity, already repeated by a second or third</a>
<a id='line_18'>      generation of obedient subjects. Experience and Christianity had</a>
<a id='line_19'>      refuted the superstitious hope, that Rome was founded by the gods</a>
<a id='line_20'>      to reign forever over the nations of the earth. But the proud</a>
<a id='line_21'>      claim of perpetual and indefeasible dominion, which her soldiers</a>
<a id='line_22'>      could no longer maintain, was firmly asserted by her statesmen</a>
<a id='line_23'>      and lawyers, whose opinions have been sometimes revived and</a>
<a id='line_24'>      propagated in the modern schools of jurisprudence. After Rome</a>
<a id='line_25'>      herself had been stripped of the Imperial purple, the princes of</a>
<a id='line_26'>      Constantinople assumed the sole and sacred sceptre of the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      monarchy; demanded, as their rightful inheritance, the provinces</a>
<a id='line_28'>      which had been subdued by the consuls, or possessed by the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      Caesars; and feebly aspired to deliver their faithful subjects of</a>
<a id='line_30'>      the West from the usurpation of heretics and Barbarians. The</a>
<a id='line_31'>      execution of this splendid design was in some degree reserved for</a>
<a id='line_32'>      Justinian. During the five first years of his reign, he</a>
<a id='line_33'>      reluctantly waged a costly and unprofitable war against the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Persians; till his pride submitted to his ambition, and he</a>
<a id='line_35'>      purchased at the price of four hundred and forty thousand pounds</a>
<a id='line_36'>      sterling, the benefit of a precarious truce, which, in the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      language of both nations, was dignified with the appellation of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      the endless peace. The safety of the East enabled the emperor to</a>
<a id='line_39'>      employ his forces against the Vandals; and the internal state of</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Africa afforded an honorable motive, and promised a powerful</a>
<a id='line_41'>      support, to the Roman arms. 1</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>      1 (return) [ The complete series of the Vandal war is related by</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Procopius in a regular and elegant narrative, (l. i. c. 9—25, l.</a>
<a id='line_45'>      ii. c. 1—13,) and happy would be my lot, could I always tread in</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the footsteps of such a guide. From the entire and diligent</a>
<a id='line_47'>      perusal of the Greek text, I have a right to pronounce that the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      Latin and French versions of Grotius and Cousin may not be</a>
<a id='line_49'>      implicitly trusted; yet the president Cousin has been often</a>
<a id='line_50'>      praised, and Hugo Grotius was the first scholar of a learned</a>
<a id='line_51'>      age.]</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>      According to the testament of the founder, the African kingdom</a>
<a id='line_54'>      had lineally descended to Hilderic, the eldest of the Vandal</a>
<a id='line_55'>      princes. A mild disposition inclined the son of a tyrant, the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      grandson of a conqueror, to prefer the counsels of clemency and</a>
<a id='line_57'>      peace; and his accession was marked by the salutary edict, which</a>
<a id='line_58'>      restored two hundred bishops to their churches, and allowed the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      free profession of the Athanasian creed. 2 But the Catholics</a>
<a id='line_60'>      accepted, with cold and transient gratitude, a favor so</a>
<a id='line_61'>      inadequate to their pretensions, and the virtues of Hilderic</a>
<a id='line_62'>      offended the prejudices of his countrymen. The Arian clergy</a>
<a id='line_63'>      presumed to insinuate that he had renounced the faith, and the</a>
<a id='line_64'>      soldiers more loudly complained that he had degenerated from the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      courage, of his ancestors. His ambassadors were suspected of a</a>
<a id='line_66'>      secret and disgraceful negotiation in the Byzantine court; and</a>
<a id='line_67'>      his general, the Achilles, 3 as he was named, of the Vandals,</a>
<a id='line_68'>      lost a battle against the naked and disorderly Moors. The public</a>
<a id='line_69'>      discontent was exasperated by Gelimer, whose age, descent, and</a>
<a id='line_70'>      military fame, gave him an apparent title to the succession: he</a>
<a id='line_71'>      assumed, with the consent of the nation, the reins of government;</a>
<a id='line_72'>      and his unfortunate sovereign sunk without a struggle from the</a>
<a id='line_73'>      throne to a dungeon, where he was strictly guarded with a</a>
<a id='line_74'>      faithful counsellor, and his unpopular nephew the Achilles of the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      Vandals. But the indulgence which Hilderic had shown to his</a>
<a id='line_76'>      Catholic subjects had powerfully recommended him to the favor of</a>
<a id='line_77'>      Justinian, who, for the benefit of his own sect, could</a>
<a id='line_78'>      acknowledge the use and justice of religious toleration: their</a>
<a id='line_79'>      alliance, while the nephew of Justin remained in a private</a>
<a id='line_80'>      station, was cemented by the mutual exchange of gifts and</a>
<a id='line_81'>      letters; and the emperor Justinian asserted the cause of royalty</a>
<a id='line_82'>      and friendship. In two successive embassies, he admonished the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      usurper to repent of his treason, or to abstain, at least, from</a>
<a id='line_84'>      any further violence which might provoke the displeasure of God</a>
<a id='line_85'>      and of the Romans; to reverence the laws of kindred and</a>
<a id='line_86'>      succession, and to suffer an infirm old man peaceably to end his</a>
<a id='line_87'>      days, either on the throne of Carthage or in the palace of</a>
<a id='line_88'>      Constantinople. The passions, or even the prudence, of Gelimer</a>
<a id='line_89'>      compelled him to reject these requests, which were urged in the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      haughty tone of menace and command; and he justified his ambition</a>
<a id='line_91'>      in a language rarely spoken in the Byzantine court, by alleging</a>
<a id='line_92'>      the right of a free people to remove or punish their chief</a>
<a id='line_93'>      magistrate, who had failed in the execution of the kingly office.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>      After this fruitless expostulation, the captive monarch was more</a>
<a id='line_96'>      rigorously treated, his nephew was deprived of his eyes, and the</a>
<a id='line_97'>      cruel Vandal, confident in his strength and distance, derided the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      vain threats and slow preparations of the emperor of the East.</a>
<a id='line_99'>      Justinian resolved to deliver or revenge his friend, Gelimer to</a>
<a id='line_100'>      maintain his usurpation; and the war was preceded, according to</a>
<a id='line_101'>      the practice of civilized nations, by the most solemn</a>
<a id='line_102'>      protestations, that each party was sincerely desirous of peace.</a>

<a id='line_117'>      the name of Achilles might be famous and popular even among the</a>
<a id='line_118'>      illiterate Barbarians.]</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>      The report of an African war was grateful only to the vain and</a>
<a id='line_121'>      idle populace of Constantinople, whose poverty exempted them from</a>
<a id='line_122'>      tribute, and whose cowardice was seldom exposed to military</a>
<a id='line_123'>      service. But the wiser citizens, who judged of the future by the</a>
<a id='line_124'>      past, revolved in their memory the immense loss, both of men and</a>
<a id='line_125'>      money, which the empire had sustained in the expedition of</a>
<a id='line_126'>      Basiliscus. The troops, which, after five laborious campaigns,</a>
<a id='line_127'>      had been recalled from the Persian frontier, dreaded the sea, the</a>
<a id='line_128'>      climate, and the arms of an unknown enemy. The ministers of the</a>
<a id='line_129'>      finances computed, as far as they might compute, the demands of</a>
<a id='line_130'>      an African war; the taxes which must be found and levied to</a>
<a id='line_131'>      supply those insatiate demands; and the danger, lest their own</a>
<a id='line_132'>      lives, or at least their lucrative employments, should be made</a>
<a id='line_133'>      responsible for the deficiency of the supply. Inspired by such</a>
<a id='line_134'>      selfish motives, (for we may not suspect him of any zeal for the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      public good,) John of Cappadocia ventured to oppose in full</a>
<a id='line_136'>      council the inclinations of his master. He confessed, that a</a>
<a id='line_137'>      victory of such importance could not be too dearly purchased; but</a>
<a id='line_138'>      he represented in a grave discourse the certain difficulties and</a>
<a id='line_139'>      the uncertain event. “You undertake,” said the praefect, “to</a>
<a id='line_140'>      besiege Carthage: by land, the distance is not less than one</a>
<a id='line_141'>      hundred and forty days’ journey; on the sea, a whole year 4 must</a>
<a id='line_142'>      elapse before you can receive any intelligence from your fleet.</a>
<a id='line_143'>      If Africa should be reduced, it cannot be preserved without the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      additional conquest of Sicily and Italy. Success will impose the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      obligations of new labors; a single misfortune will attract the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      Barbarians into the heart of your exhausted empire.” Justinian</a>
<a id='line_147'>      felt the weight of this salutary advice; he was confounded by the</a>
<a id='line_148'>      unwonted freedom of an obsequious servant; and the design of the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      war would perhaps have been relinquished, if his courage had not</a>
<a id='line_150'>      been revived by a voice which silenced the doubts of profane</a>
<a id='line_151'>      reason. “I have seen a vision,” cried an artful or fanatic bishop</a>
<a id='line_152'>      of the East. “It is the will of Heaven, O emperor! that you</a>
<a id='line_153'>      should not abandon your holy enterprise for the deliverance of</a>
<a id='line_154'>      the African church. The God of battles will march before your</a>
<a id='line_155'>      standard, and disperse your enemies, who are the enemies of his</a>
<a id='line_156'>      Son.” The emperor, might be tempted, and his counsellors were</a>
<a id='line_157'>      constrained, to give credit to this seasonable revelation: but</a>
<a id='line_158'>      they derived more rational hope from the revolt, which the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      adherents of Hilderic or Athanasius had already excited on the</a>
<a id='line_160'>      borders of the Vandal monarchy. Pudentius, an African subject,</a>
<a id='line_161'>      had privately signified his loyal intentions, and a small</a>
<a id='line_162'>      military aid restored the province of Tripoli to the obedience of</a>
<a id='line_163'>      the Romans. The government of Sardinia had been intrusted to</a>
<a id='line_164'>      Godas, a valiant Barbarian he suspended the payment of tribute,</a>
<a id='line_165'>      disclaimed his allegiance to the usurper, and gave audience to</a>
<a id='line_166'>      the emissaries of Justinian, who found him master of that</a>
<a id='line_167'>      fruitful island, at the head of his guards, and proudly invested</a>
<a id='line_168'>      with the ensigns of royalty. The forces of the Vandals were</a>
<a id='line_169'>      diminished by discord and suspicion; the Roman armies were</a>
<a id='line_170'>      animated by the spirit of Belisarius; one of those heroic names</a>
<a id='line_171'>      which are familiar to every age and to every nation.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>      4 (return) [ A year—absurd exaggeration! The conquest of Africa</a>
<a id='line_174'>      may be dated A. D 533, September 14. It is celebrated by</a>
<a id='line_175'>      Justinian in the preface to his Institutes, which were published</a>
<a id='line_176'>      November 21 of the same year. Including the voyage and return,</a>
<a id='line_177'>      such a computation might be truly applied to our Indian empire.]</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>      The Africanus of new Rome was born, and perhaps educated, among</a>
<a id='line_180'>      the Thracian peasants, 5 without any of those advantages which</a>
<a id='line_181'>      had formed the virtues of the elder and younger Scipio; a noble</a>
<a id='line_182'>      origin, liberal studies, and the emulation of a free state.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>      The silence of a loquacious secretary may be admitted, to prove</a>
<a id='line_185'>      that the youth of Belisarius could not afford any subject of</a>
<a id='line_186'>      praise: he served, most assuredly with valor and reputation,</a>
<a id='line_187'>      among the private guards of Justinian; and when his patron became</a>
<a id='line_188'>      emperor, the domestic was promoted to military command. After a</a>
<a id='line_189'>      bold inroad into Persarmenia, in which his glory was shared by a</a>
<a id='line_190'>      colleague, and his progress was checked by an enemy, Belisarius</a>
<a id='line_191'>      repaired to the important station of Dara, where he first</a>
<a id='line_192'>      accepted the service of Procopius, the faithful companion, and</a>
<a id='line_193'>      diligent historian, of his exploits. 6 The Mirranes of Persia</a>
<a id='line_194'>      advanced, with forty thousand of her best troops, to raze the</a>
<a id='line_195'>      fortifications of Dara; and signified the day and the hour on</a>
<a id='line_196'>      which the citizens should prepare a bath for his refreshment,</a>
<a id='line_197'>      after the toils of victory. He encountered an adversary equal to</a>
<a id='line_198'>      himself, by the new title of General of the East; his superior in</a>
<a id='line_199'>      the science of war, but much inferior in the number and quality</a>
<a id='line_200'>      of his troops, which amounted only to twenty-five thousand Romans</a>
<a id='line_201'>      and strangers, relaxed in their discipline, and humbled by recent</a>
<a id='line_202'>      disasters. As the level plain of Dara refused all shelter to</a>
<a id='line_203'>      stratagem and ambush, Belisarius protected his front with a deep</a>
<a id='line_204'>      trench, which was prolonged at first in perpendicular, and</a>
<a id='line_205'>      afterwards in parallel, lines, to cover the wings of cavalry</a>
<a id='line_206'>      advantageously posted to command the flanks and rear of the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      enemy. When the Roman centre was shaken, their well-timed and</a>
<a id='line_208'>      rapid charge decided the conflict: the standard of Persia fell;</a>
<a id='line_209'>      the immortals fled; the infantry threw away their bucklers, and</a>
<a id='line_210'>      eight thousand of the vanquished were left on the field of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      battle. In the next campaign, Syria was invaded on the side of</a>
<a id='line_212'>      the desert; and Belisarius, with twenty thousand men, hastened</a>
<a id='line_213'>      from Dara to the relief of the province. During the whole summer,</a>
<a id='line_214'>      the designs of the enemy were baffled by his skilful</a>
<a id='line_215'>      dispositions: he pressed their retreat, occupied each night their</a>
<a id='line_216'>      camp of the preceding day, and would have secured a bloodless</a>
<a id='line_217'>      victory, if he could have resisted the impatience of his own</a>
<a id='line_218'>      troops. Their valiant promise was faintly supported in the hour</a>
<a id='line_219'>      of battle; the right wing was exposed by the treacherous or</a>
<a id='line_220'>      cowardly desertion of the Christian Arabs; the Huns, a veteran</a>
<a id='line_221'>      band of eight hundred warriors, were oppressed by superior</a>
<a id='line_222'>      numbers; the flight of the Isaurians was intercepted; but the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      Roman infantry stood firm on the left; for Belisarius himself,</a>
<a id='line_224'>      dismounting from his horse, showed them that intrepid despair was</a>
<a id='line_225'>      their only safety. 611 They turned their backs to the Euphrates,</a>
<a id='line_226'>      and their faces to the enemy: innumerable arrows glanced without</a>
<a id='line_227'>      effect from the compact and shelving order of their bucklers; an</a>
<a id='line_228'>      impenetrable line of pikes was opposed to the repeated assaults</a>
<a id='line_229'>      of the Persian cavalry; and after a resistance of many hours, the</a>
<a id='line_230'>      remaining troops were skilfully embarked under the shadow of the</a>
<a id='line_231'>      night. The Persian commander retired with disorder and disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_232'>      to answer a strict account of the lives of so many soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_233'>      which he had consumed in a barren victory. But the fame of</a>
<a id='line_234'>      Belisarius was not sullied by a defeat, in which he alone had</a>
<a id='line_235'>      saved his army from the consequences of their own rashness: the</a>
<a id='line_236'>      approach of peace relieved him from the guard of the eastern</a>
<a id='line_237'>      frontier, and his conduct in the sedition of Constantinople amply</a>
<a id='line_238'>      discharged his obligations to the emperor. When the African war</a>
<a id='line_239'>      became the topic of popular discourse and secret deliberation,</a>
<a id='line_240'>      each of the Roman generals was apprehensive, rather than</a>
<a id='line_241'>      ambitious, of the dangerous honor; but as soon as Justinian had</a>
<a id='line_242'>      declared his preference of superior merit, their envy was</a>
<a id='line_243'>      rekindled by the unanimous applause which was given to the choice</a>
<a id='line_244'>      of Belisarius. The temper of the Byzantine court may encourage a</a>
<a id='line_245'>      suspicion, that the hero was darkly assisted by the intrigues of</a>
<a id='line_246'>      his wife, the fair and subtle Antonina, who alternately enjoyed</a>
<a id='line_247'>      the confidence, and incurred the hatred, of the empress Theodora.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>      The birth of Antonina was ignoble; she descended from a family of</a>
<a id='line_250'>      charioteers; and her chastity has been stained with the foulest</a>
<a id='line_251'>      reproach. Yet she reigned with long and absolute power over the</a>
<a id='line_252'>      mind of her illustrious husband; and if Antonina disdained the</a>

<a id='line_301'>      dependence. From a laudable desire to assert the dignity of his</a>

<a id='line_304'>      heavy-armed warriors of antiquity, and maliciously observed, that</a>

<a id='line_306'>      “Such contempt might perhaps be due to the naked youths who</a>
<a id='line_307'>      appeared on foot in the fields of Troy, and lurking behind a</a>

<a id='line_313'>      their legs, and their bodies are guarded by a coat of mail. On</a>
<a id='line_314'>      their right side hangs a quiver, a sword on their left, and their</a>
<a id='line_315'>      hand is accustomed to wield a lance or javelin in closer combat.</a>
<a id='line_316'>      Their bows are strong and weighty; they shoot in every possible</a>

<a id='line_318'>      to either flank; and as they are taught to draw the bow-string</a>
<a id='line_319'>      not to the breast, but to the right ear, firm indeed must be the</a>
<a id='line_320'>      armor that can resist the rapid violence of their shaft.” Five</a>
<a id='line_321'>      hundred transports, navigated by twenty thousand mariners of</a>
<a id='line_322'>      Egypt, Cilicia, and Ionia, were collected in the harbor of</a>

<a id='line_324'>      thirty, the largest at five hundred, tons; and the fair average</a>
<a id='line_325'>      will supply an allowance, liberal, but not profuse, of about one</a>

<a id='line_366'>      In the seventh year of the reign of Justinian, and about the time</a>
<a id='line_367'>      of the summer solstice, the whole fleet of six hundred ships was</a>
<a id='line_368'>      ranged in martial pomp before the gardens of the palace. The</a>
<a id='line_369'>      patriarch pronounced his benediction, the emperor signified his</a>

<a id='line_372'>      explored, with anxious curiosity, the omens of misfortune and</a>

<a id='line_374'>      Belisarius waited five days to receive some Thracian horses, a</a>
<a id='line_375'>      military gift of his sovereign. From thence the fleet pursued</a>
<a id='line_376'>      their course through the midst of the Propontis; but as they</a>
<a id='line_377'>      struggled to pass the Straits of the Hellespont, an unfavorable</a>
<a id='line_378'>      wind detained them four days at Abydus, where the general</a>
<a id='line_379'>      exhibited a memorable lesson of firmness and severity. Two of the</a>
<a id='line_380'>      Huns, who in a drunken quarrel had slain one of their</a>
<a id='line_381'>      fellow-soldiers, were instantly shown to the army suspended on a</a>
<a id='line_382'>      lofty gibbet. The national indignity was resented by their</a>
<a id='line_383'>      countrymen, who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire, and</a>
<a id='line_384'>      asserted the free privilege of Scythia, where a small fine was</a>
<a id='line_385'>      allowed to expiate the hasty sallies of intemperance and anger.</a>
<a id='line_386'>      Their complaints were specious, their clamors were loud, and the</a>
<a id='line_387'>      Romans were not averse to the example of disorder and impunity.</a>
<a id='line_388'>      But the rising sedition was appeased by the authority and</a>
<a id='line_389'>      eloquence of the general: and he represented to the assembled</a>
<a id='line_390'>      troops the obligation of justice, the importance of discipline,</a>
<a id='line_391'>      the rewards of piety and virtue, and the unpardonable guilt of</a>
<a id='line_392'>      murder, which, in his apprehension, was aggravated rather than</a>
<a id='line_393'>      excused by the vice of intoxication. 11 In the navigation from</a>
<a id='line_394'>      the Hellespont to Peloponnesus, which the Greeks, after the siege</a>
<a id='line_395'>      of Troy, had performed in four days, 12 the fleet of Belisarius</a>
<a id='line_396'>      was guided in their course by his master-galley, conspicuous in</a>
<a id='line_397'>      the day by the redness of the sails, and in the night by the</a>
<a id='line_398'>      torches blazing from the mast head. It was the duty of the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      pilots, as they steered between the islands, and turned the Capes</a>
<a id='line_400'>      of Malea and Taenarium, to preserve the just order and regular</a>
<a id='line_401'>      intervals of such a multitude of ships: as the wind was fair and</a>
<a id='line_402'>      moderate, their labors were not unsuccessful, and the troops were</a>
<a id='line_403'>      safely disembarked at Methone on the Messenian coast, to repose</a>
<a id='line_404'>      themselves for a while after the fatigues of the sea. In this</a>
<a id='line_405'>      place they experienced how avarice, invested with authority, may</a>
<a id='line_406'>      sport with the lives of thousands which are bravely exposed for</a>
<a id='line_407'>      the public service. According to military practice, the bread or</a>
<a id='line_408'>      biscuit of the Romans was twice prepared in the oven, and the</a>
<a id='line_409'>      diminution of one fourth was cheerfully allowed for the loss of</a>
<a id='line_410'>      weight. To gain this miserable profit, and to save the expense of</a>
<a id='line_411'>      wood, the praefect John of Cappadocia had given orders that the</a>
<a id='line_412'>      flour should be slightly baked by the same fire which warmed the</a>
<a id='line_413'>      baths of Constantinople; and when the sacks were opened, a soft</a>
<a id='line_414'>      and mouldy paste was distributed to the army. Such unwholesome</a>
<a id='line_415'>      food, assisted by the heat of the climate and season, soon</a>
<a id='line_416'>      produced an epidemical disease, which swept away five hundred</a>
<a id='line_417'>      soldiers. Their health was restored by the diligence of</a>
<a id='line_418'>      Belisarius, who provided fresh bread at Methone, and boldly</a>
<a id='line_419'>      expressed his just and humane indignation; the emperor heard his</a>
<a id='line_420'>      complaint; the general was praised but the minister was not</a>
<a id='line_421'>      punished. From the port of Methone, the pilots steered along the</a>
<a id='line_422'>      western coast of Peloponnesus, as far as the Isle of Zacynthus,</a>
<a id='line_423'>      or Zante, before they undertook the voyage (in their eyes a most</a>
<a id='line_424'>      arduous voyage) of one hundred leagues over the Ionian Sea. As</a>
<a id='line_425'>      the fleet was surprised by a calm, sixteen days were consumed in</a>
<a id='line_426'>      the slow navigation; and even the general would have suffered the</a>
<a id='line_427'>      intolerable hardship of thirst, if the ingenuity of Antonina had</a>
<a id='line_428'>      not preserved the water in glass bottles, which she buried deep</a>
<a id='line_429'>      in the sand in a part of the ship impervious to the rays of the</a>
<a id='line_430'>      sun. At length the harbor of Caucana, 13 on the southern side of</a>
<a id='line_431'>      Sicily, afforded a secure and hospitable shelter. The Gothic</a>
<a id='line_432'>      officers who governed the island in the name of the daughter and</a>
<a id='line_433'>      grandson of Theodoric, obeyed their imprudent orders, to receive</a>
<a id='line_434'>      the troops of Justinian like friends and allies: provisions were</a>

<a id='line_437'>      and designs of the Vandals. His intelligence determined</a>
<a id='line_438'>      Belisarius to hasten his operations, and his wise impatience was</a>
<a id='line_439'>      seconded by the winds. The fleet lost sight of Sicily, passed</a>
<a id='line_440'>      before the Isle of Malta, discovered the capes of Africa, ran</a>
<a id='line_441'>      along the coast with a strong gale from the north-east, and</a>

<a id='line_502'>      Romans. The next morning, some of the neighboring gardens were</a>
<a id='line_503'>      pillaged; and Belisarius, after chastising the offenders,</a>
<a id='line_504'>      embraced the slight occasion, but the decisive moment, of</a>
<a id='line_505'>      inculcating the maxims of justice, moderation, and genuine</a>
<a id='line_506'>      policy. “When I first accepted the commission of subduing Africa,</a>
<a id='line_507'>      I depended much less,” said the general, “on the numbers, or even</a>
<a id='line_508'>      the bravery of my troops, than on the friendly disposition of the</a>
<a id='line_509'>      natives, and their immortal hatred to the Vandals. You alone can</a>
<a id='line_510'>      deprive me of this hope; if you continue to extort by rapine what</a>
<a id='line_511'>      might be purchased for a little money, such acts of violence will</a>
<a id='line_512'>      reconcile these implacable enemies, and unite them in a just and</a>
<a id='line_513'>      holy league against the invaders of their country.” These</a>
<a id='line_514'>      exhortations were enforced by a rigid discipline, of which the</a>
<a id='line_515'>      soldiers themselves soon felt and praised the salutary effects.</a>
<a id='line_516'>      The inhabitants, instead of deserting their houses, or hiding</a>
<a id='line_517'>      their corn, supplied the Romans with a fair and liberal market:</a>
<a id='line_518'>      the civil officers of the province continued to exercise their</a>
<a id='line_519'>      functions in the name of Justinian: and the clergy, from motives</a>
<a id='line_520'>      of conscience and interest, assiduously labored to promote the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      cause of a Catholic emperor. The small town of Sullecte, 17 one</a>
<a id='line_522'>      day’s journey from the camp, had the honor of being foremost to</a>
<a id='line_523'>      open her gates, and to resume her ancient allegiance: the larger</a>
<a id='line_524'>      cities of Leptis and Adrumetum imitated the example of loyalty as</a>
<a id='line_525'>      soon as Belisarius appeared; and he advanced without opposition</a>
<a id='line_526'>      as far as Grasse, a palace of the Vandal kings, at the distance</a>
<a id='line_527'>      of fifty miles from Carthage. The weary Romans indulged</a>
<a id='line_528'>      themselves in the refreshment of shady groves, cool fountains,</a>
<a id='line_529'>      and delicious fruits; and the preference which Procopius allows</a>
<a id='line_530'>      to these gardens over any that he had seen, either in the East or</a>
<a id='line_531'>      West, may be ascribed either to the taste, or the fatigue, of the</a>
<a id='line_532'>      historian. In three generations, prosperity and a warm climate</a>
<a id='line_533'>      had dissolved the hardy virtue of the Vandals, who insensibly</a>
<a id='line_534'>      became the most luxurious of mankind. In their villas and</a>

<a id='line_539'>      robes loosely flowing, after the fashion of the Medes, were</a>

<a id='line_565'>      constantly awake and active against his unseen enemies, by whom,</a>
<a id='line_566'>      in every place, and at every hour, he might be suddenly attacked.</a>
<a id='line_567'>      An officer of confidence and merit, John the Armenian, led the</a>

<a id='line_571'>      moved each day about twelve miles, and lodged in the evening in</a>
<a id='line_572'>      strong camps, or in friendly towns. The near approach of the</a>
<a id='line_573'>      Romans to Carthage filled the mind of Gelimer with anxiety and</a>
<a id='line_574'>      terror. He prudently wished to protract the war till his brother,</a>
<a id='line_575'>      with his veteran troops, should return from the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_576'>      Sardinia; and he now lamented the rash policy of his ancestors,</a>
<a id='line_577'>      who, by destroying the fortifications of Africa, had left him</a>
<a id='line_578'>      only the dangerous resource of risking a battle in the</a>
<a id='line_579'>      neighborhood of his capital. The Vandal conquerors, from their</a>
<a id='line_580'>      original number of fifty thousand, were multiplied, without</a>
<a id='line_581'>      including their women and children, to one hundred and sixty</a>
<a id='line_582'>      thousand fighting men: 1811 and such forces, animated with valor</a>
<a id='line_583'>      and union, might have crushed, at their first landing, the feeble</a>
<a id='line_584'>      and exhausted bands of the Roman general. But the friends of the</a>
<a id='line_585'>      captive king were more inclined to accept the invitations, than</a>
<a id='line_586'>      to resist the progress, of Belisarius; and many a proud Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_587'>      disguised his aversion to war under the more specious name of his</a>
<a id='line_588'>      hatred to the usurper. Yet the authority and promises of Gelimer</a>
<a id='line_589'>      collected a formidable army, and his plans were concerted with</a>
<a id='line_590'>      some degree of military skill. An order was despatched to his</a>
<a id='line_591'>      brother Ammatas, to collect all the forces of Carthage, and to</a>
<a id='line_592'>      encounter the van of the Roman army at the distance of ten miles</a>
<a id='line_593'>      from the city: his nephew Gibamund, with two thousand horse, was</a>
<a id='line_594'>      destined to attack their left, when the monarch himself, who</a>
<a id='line_595'>      silently followed, should charge their rear, in a situation which</a>
<a id='line_596'>      excluded them from the aid or even the view of their fleet. But</a>
<a id='line_597'>      the rashness of Ammatas was fatal to himself and his country. He</a>
<a id='line_598'>      anticipated the hour of the attack, outstripped his tardy</a>
<a id='line_599'>      followers, and was pierced with a mortal wound, after he had</a>
<a id='line_600'>      slain with his own hand twelve of his boldest antagonists. His</a>
<a id='line_601'>      Vandals fled to Carthage; the highway, almost ten miles, was</a>
<a id='line_602'>      strewed with dead bodies; and it seemed incredible that such</a>
<a id='line_603'>      multitudes could be slaughtered by the swords of three hundred</a>
<a id='line_604'>      Romans. The nephew of Gelimer was defeated, after a slight</a>
<a id='line_605'>      combat, by the six hundred Massagetae: they did not equal the</a>
<a id='line_606'>      third part of his numbers; but each Scythian was fired by the</a>
<a id='line_607'>      example of his chief, who gloriously exercised the privilege of</a>
<a id='line_608'>      his family, by riding, foremost and alone, to shoot the first</a>
<a id='line_609'>      arrow against the enemy. In the mean while, Gelimer himself,</a>
<a id='line_610'>      ignorant of the event, and misguided by the windings of the</a>
<a id='line_611'>      hills, inadvertently passed the Roman army, and reached the scene</a>
<a id='line_612'>      of action where Ammatas had fallen. He wept the fate of his</a>
<a id='line_613'>      brother and of Carthage, charged with irresistible fury the</a>
<a id='line_614'>      advancing squadrons, and might have pursued, and perhaps decided,</a>
<a id='line_615'>      the victory, if he had not wasted those inestimable moments in</a>
<a id='line_616'>      the discharge of a vain, though pious, duty to the dead. While</a>
<a id='line_617'>      his spirit was broken by this mournful office, he heard the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      trumpet of Belisarius, who, leaving Antonina and his infantry in</a>
<a id='line_619'>      the camp, pressed forwards with his guards and the remainder of</a>
<a id='line_620'>      the cavalry to rally his flying troops, and to restore the</a>
<a id='line_621'>      fortune of the day. Much room could not be found, in this</a>
<a id='line_622'>      disorderly battle, for the talents of a general; but the king</a>
<a id='line_623'>      fled before the hero; and the Vandals, accustomed only to a</a>
<a id='line_624'>      Moorish enemy, were incapable of withstanding the arms and</a>
<a id='line_625'>      discipline of the Romans. Gelimer retired with hasty steps</a>
<a id='line_626'>      towards the desert of Numidia: but he had soon the consolation of</a>
<a id='line_627'>      learning that his private orders for the execution of Hilderic</a>
<a id='line_628'>      and his captive friends had been faithfully obeyed. The tyrant’s</a>
<a id='line_629'>      revenge was useful only to his enemies. The death of a lawful</a>
<a id='line_630'>      prince excited the compassion of his people; his life might have</a>
<a id='line_631'>      perplexed the victorious Romans; and the lieutenant of Justinian,</a>
<a id='line_632'>      by a crime of which he was innocent, was relieved from the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      painful alternative of forfeiting his honor or relinquishing his</a>

<a id='line_645'>      As soon as the tumult had subsided, the several parts of the army</a>
<a id='line_646'>      informed each other of the accidents of the day; and Belisarius</a>
<a id='line_647'>      pitched his camp on the field of victory, to which the tenth</a>
<a id='line_648'>      mile-stone from Carthage had applied the Latin appellation of</a>
<a id='line_649'>      Decimus. From a wise suspicion of the stratagems and resources of</a>
<a id='line_650'>      the Vandals, he marched the next day in order of battle, halted</a>
<a id='line_651'>      in the evening before the gates of Carthage, and allowed a night</a>
<a id='line_652'>      of repose, that he might not, in darkness and disorder, expose</a>
<a id='line_653'>      the city to the license of the soldiers, or the soldiers</a>
<a id='line_654'>      themselves to the secret ambush of the city. But as the fears of</a>
<a id='line_655'>      Belisarius were the result of calm and intrepid reason, he was</a>
<a id='line_656'>      soon satisfied that he might confide, without danger, in the</a>
<a id='line_657'>      peaceful and friendly aspect of the capital. Carthage blazed with</a>
<a id='line_658'>      innumerable torches, the signals of the public joy; the chain was</a>
<a id='line_659'>      removed that guarded the entrance of the port; the gates were</a>
<a id='line_660'>      thrown open, and the people, with acclamations of gratitude,</a>
<a id='line_661'>      hailed and invited their Roman deliverers. The defeat of the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      Vandals, and the freedom of Africa, were announced to the city on</a>
<a id='line_663'>      the eve of St. Cyprian, when the churches were already adorned</a>
<a id='line_664'>      and illuminated for the festival of the martyr whom three</a>
<a id='line_665'>      centuries of superstition had almost raised to a local deity. The</a>
<a id='line_666'>      Arians, conscious that their reign had expired, resigned the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      temple to the Catholics, who rescued their saint from profane</a>
<a id='line_668'>      hands, performed the holy rites, and loudly proclaimed the creed</a>
<a id='line_669'>      of Athanasius and Justinian. One awful hour reversed the fortunes</a>
<a id='line_670'>      of the contending parties. The suppliant Vandals, who had so</a>
<a id='line_671'>      lately indulged the vices of conquerors, sought an humble refuge</a>
<a id='line_672'>      in the sanctuary of the church; while the merchants of the East</a>
<a id='line_673'>      were delivered from the deepest dungeon of the palace by their</a>
<a id='line_674'>      affrighted keeper, who implored the protection of his captives,</a>
<a id='line_675'>      and showed them, through an aperture in the wall, the sails of</a>
<a id='line_676'>      the Roman fleet. After their separation from the army, the naval</a>
<a id='line_677'>      commanders had proceeded with slow caution along the coast till</a>
<a id='line_678'>      they reached the Hermaean promontory, and obtained the first</a>
<a id='line_679'>      intelligence of the victory of Belisarius. Faithful to his</a>
<a id='line_680'>      instructions, they would have cast anchor about twenty miles from</a>
<a id='line_681'>      Carthage, if the more skilful seamen had not represented the</a>
<a id='line_682'>      perils of the shore, and the signs of an impending tempest. Still</a>
<a id='line_683'>      ignorant of the revolution, they declined, however, the rash</a>
<a id='line_684'>      attempt of forcing the chain of the port; and the adjacent harbor</a>
<a id='line_685'>      and suburb of Mandracium were insulted only by the rapine of a</a>
<a id='line_686'>      private officer, who disobeyed and deserted his leaders. But the</a>
<a id='line_687'>      Imperial fleet, advancing with a fair wind, steered through the</a>
<a id='line_688'>      narrow entrance of the Goletta, and occupied, in the deep and</a>
<a id='line_689'>      capacious lake of Tunis, a secure station about five miles from</a>
<a id='line_690'>      the capital. 19 No sooner was Belisarius informed of their</a>
<a id='line_691'>      arrival, than he despatched orders that the greatest part of the</a>
<a id='line_692'>      mariners should be immediately landed to join the triumph, and to</a>
<a id='line_693'>      swell the apparent numbers, of the Romans. Before he allowed them</a>
<a id='line_694'>      to enter the gates of Carthage, he exhorted them, in a discourse</a>
<a id='line_695'>      worthy of himself and the occasion, not to disgrace the glory of</a>
<a id='line_696'>      their arms; and to remember that the Vandals had been the</a>
<a id='line_697'>      tyrants, but that they were the deliverers, of the Africans, who</a>
<a id='line_698'>      must now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate subjects</a>
<a id='line_699'>      of their common sovereign. The Romans marched through the streets</a>
<a id='line_700'>      in close ranks prepared for battle if an enemy had appeared: the</a>
<a id='line_701'>      strict order maintained by the general imprinted on their minds</a>
<a id='line_702'>      the duty of obedience; and in an age in which custom and impunity</a>
<a id='line_703'>      almost sanctified the abuse of conquest, the genius of one man</a>
<a id='line_704'>      repressed the passions of a victorious army. The voice of menace</a>
<a id='line_705'>      and complaint was silent; the trade of Carthage was not</a>
<a id='line_706'>      interrupted; while Africa changed her master and her government,</a>
<a id='line_707'>      the shops continued open and busy; and the soldiers, after</a>
<a id='line_708'>      sufficient guards had been posted, modestly departed to the</a>
<a id='line_709'>      houses which were allotted for their reception. Belisarius fixed</a>
<a id='line_710'>      his residence in the palace; seated himself on the throne of</a>
<a id='line_711'>      Genseric; accepted and distributed the Barbaric spoil; granted</a>
<a id='line_712'>      their lives to the suppliant Vandals; and labored to repair the</a>
<a id='line_713'>      damage which the suburb of Mandracium had sustained in the</a>
<a id='line_714'>      preceding night. At supper he entertained his principal officers</a>
<a id='line_715'>      with the form and magnificence of a royal banquet. 20 The victor</a>
<a id='line_716'>      was respectfully served by the captive officers of the household;</a>
<a id='line_717'>      and in the moments of festivity, when the impartial spectators</a>
<a id='line_718'>      applauded the fortune and merit of Belisarius, his envious</a>
<a id='line_719'>      flatterers secretly shed their venom on every word and gesture</a>
<a id='line_720'>      which might alarm the suspicions of a jealous monarch. One day</a>
<a id='line_721'>      was given to these pompous scenes, which may not be despised as</a>
<a id='line_722'>      useless, if they attracted the popular veneration; but the active</a>
<a id='line_723'>      mind of Belisarius, which in the pride of victory could suppose a</a>
<a id='line_724'>      defeat, had already resolved that the Roman empire in Africa</a>
<a id='line_725'>      should not depend on the chance of arms, or the favor of the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      people. The fortifications of Carthage 2011 had alone been</a>
<a id='line_727'>      exempted from the general proscription; but in the reign of</a>
<a id='line_728'>      ninety-five years they were suffered to decay by the thoughtless</a>

<a id='line_756'>      That unfortunate monarch, after the loss of his capital, applied</a>
<a id='line_757'>      himself to collect the remains of an army scattered, rather than</a>
<a id='line_758'>      destroyed, by the preceding battle; and the hopes of pillage</a>
<a id='line_759'>      attracted some Moorish bands to the standard of Gelimer. He</a>
<a id='line_760'>      encamped in the fields of Bulla, four days’ journey from</a>
<a id='line_761'>      Carthage; insulted the capital, which he deprived of the use of</a>
<a id='line_762'>      an aqueduct; proposed a high reward for the head of every Roman;</a>
<a id='line_763'>      affected to spare the persons and property of his African</a>
<a id='line_764'>      subjects, and secretly negotiated with the Arian sectaries and</a>
<a id='line_765'>      the confederate Huns. Under these circumstances, the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_766'>      Sardinia served only to aggravate his distress: he reflected,</a>
<a id='line_767'>      with the deepest anguish, that he had wasted, in that useless</a>
<a id='line_768'>      enterprise, five thousand of his bravest troops; and he read,</a>
<a id='line_769'>      with grief and shame, the victorious letters of his brother Zano,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      2012 who expressed a sanguine confidence that the king, after the</a>
<a id='line_771'>      example of their ancestors, had already chastised the rashness of</a>
<a id='line_772'>      the Roman invader. “Alas! my brother,” replied Gelimer, “Heaven</a>
<a id='line_773'>      has declared against our unhappy nation. While you have subdued</a>
<a id='line_774'>      Sardinia, we have lost Africa. No sooner did Belisarius appear</a>
<a id='line_775'>      with a handful of soldiers, than courage and prosperity deserted</a>
<a id='line_776'>      the cause of the Vandals. Your nephew Gibamund, your brother</a>
<a id='line_777'>      Ammatas, have been betrayed to death by the cowardice of their</a>
<a id='line_778'>      followers. Our horses, our ships, Carthage itself, and all</a>
<a id='line_779'>      Africa, are in the power of the enemy. Yet the Vandals still</a>
<a id='line_780'>      prefer an ignominious repose, at the expense of their wives and</a>
<a id='line_781'>      children, their wealth and liberty. Nothing now remains, except</a>
<a id='line_782'>      the fields of Bulla, and the hope of your valor. Abandon</a>
<a id='line_783'>      Sardinia; fly to our relief; restore our empire, or perish by our</a>
<a id='line_784'>      side.” On the receipt of this epistle, Zano imparted his grief to</a>
<a id='line_785'>      the principal Vandals; but the intelligence was prudently</a>
<a id='line_786'>      concealed from the natives of the island. The troops embarked in</a>
<a id='line_787'>      one hundred and twenty galleys at the port of Caghari, cast</a>
<a id='line_788'>      anchor the third day on the confines of Mauritania, and hastily</a>
<a id='line_789'>      pursued their march to join the royal standard in the camp of</a>
<a id='line_790'>      Bulla. Mournful was the interview: the two brothers embraced;</a>
<a id='line_791'>      they wept in silence; no questions were asked of the Sardinian</a>
<a id='line_792'>      victory; no inquiries were made of the African misfortunes: they</a>
<a id='line_793'>      saw before their eyes the whole extent of their calamities; and</a>
<a id='line_794'>      the absence of their wives and children afforded a melancholy</a>
<a id='line_795'>      proof that either death or captivity had been their lot. The</a>
<a id='line_796'>      languid spirit of the Vandals was at length awakened and united</a>
<a id='line_797'>      by the entreaties of their king, the example of Zano, and the</a>
<a id='line_798'>      instant danger which threatened their monarchy and religion. The</a>
<a id='line_799'>      military strength of the nation advanced to battle; and such was</a>
<a id='line_800'>      the rapid increase, that before their army reached Tricameron,</a>
<a id='line_801'>      about twenty miles from Carthage, they might boast, perhaps with</a>
<a id='line_802'>      some exaggeration, that they surpassed, in a tenfold proportion,</a>
<a id='line_803'>      the diminutive powers of the Romans. But these powers were under</a>
<a id='line_804'>      the command of Belisarius; and, as he was conscious of their</a>
<a id='line_805'>      superior merit, he permitted the Barbarians to surprise him at an</a>
<a id='line_806'>      unseasonable hour. The Romans were instantly under arms; a</a>
<a id='line_807'>      rivulet covered their front; the cavalry formed the first line,</a>
<a id='line_808'>      which Belisarius supported in the centre, at the head of five</a>
<a id='line_809'>      hundred guards; the infantry, at some distance, was posted in the</a>
<a id='line_810'>      second line; and the vigilance of the general watched the</a>
<a id='line_811'>      separate station and ambiguous faith of the Massagetae, who</a>
<a id='line_812'>      secretly reserved their aid for the conquerors. The historian has</a>
<a id='line_813'>      inserted, and the reader may easily supply, the speeches 21 of</a>
<a id='line_814'>      the commanders, who, by arguments the most apposite to their</a>
<a id='line_815'>      situation, inculcated the importance of victory, and the contempt</a>
<a id='line_816'>      of life. Zano, with the troops which had followed him to the</a>
<a id='line_817'>      conquest of Sardinia, was placed in the centre; and the throne of</a>
<a id='line_818'>      Genseric might have stood, if the multitude of Vandals had</a>
<a id='line_819'>      imitated their intrepid resolution. Casting away their lances and</a>
<a id='line_820'>      missile weapons, they drew their swords, and expected the charge:</a>
<a id='line_821'>      the Roman cavalry thrice passed the rivulet; they were thrice</a>
<a id='line_822'>      repulsed; and the conflict was firmly maintained, till Zano fell,</a>
<a id='line_823'>      and the standard of Belisarius was displayed. Gelimer retreated</a>
<a id='line_824'>      to his camp; the Huns joined the pursuit; and the victors</a>
<a id='line_825'>      despoiled the bodies of the slain. Yet no more than fifty Romans,</a>
<a id='line_826'>      and eight hundred Vandals were found on the field of battle; so</a>
<a id='line_827'>      inconsiderable was the carnage of a day, which extinguished a</a>
<a id='line_828'>      nation, and transferred the empire of Africa. In the evening</a>
<a id='line_829'>      Belisarius led his infantry to the attack of the camp; and the</a>
<a id='line_830'>      pusillanimous flight of Gelimer exposed the vanity of his recent</a>
<a id='line_831'>      declarations, that to the vanquished, death was a relief, life a</a>
<a id='line_832'>      burden, and infamy the only object of terror. His departure was</a>
<a id='line_833'>      secret; but as soon as the Vandals discovered that their king had</a>
<a id='line_834'>      deserted them, they hastily dispersed, anxious only for their</a>
<a id='line_835'>      personal safety, and careless of every object that is dear or</a>
<a id='line_836'>      valuable to mankind. The Romans entered the camp without</a>
<a id='line_837'>      resistance; and the wildest scenes of disorder were veiled in the</a>
<a id='line_838'>      darkness and confusion of the night. Every Barbarian who met</a>
<a id='line_839'>      their swords was inhumanly massacred; their widows and daughters,</a>
<a id='line_840'>      as rich heirs, or beautiful concubines, were embraced by the</a>
<a id='line_841'>      licentious soldiers; and avarice itself was almost satiated with</a>
<a id='line_842'>      the treasures of gold and silver, the accumulated fruits of</a>
<a id='line_843'>      conquest or economy in a long period of prosperity and peace. In</a>
<a id='line_844'>      this frantic search, the troops, even of Belisarius, forgot their</a>
<a id='line_845'>      caution and respect. Intoxicated with lust and rapine, they</a>
<a id='line_846'>      explored, in small parties, or alone, the adjacent fields, the</a>
<a id='line_847'>      woods, the rocks, and the caverns, that might possibly conceal</a>
<a id='line_848'>      any desirable prize: laden with booty, they deserted their ranks,</a>
<a id='line_849'>      and wandered without a guide, on the high road to Carthage; and</a>
<a id='line_850'>      if the flying enemies had dared to return, very few of the</a>
<a id='line_851'>      conquerors would have escaped. Deeply sensible of the disgrace</a>
<a id='line_852'>      and danger, Belisarius passed an apprehensive night on the field</a>
<a id='line_853'>      of victory: at the dawn of day, he planted his standard on a</a>
<a id='line_854'>      hill, recalled his guardians and veterans, and gradually restored</a>
<a id='line_855'>      the modesty and obedience of the camp. It was equally the concern</a>
<a id='line_856'>      of the Roman general to subdue the hostile, and to save the</a>
<a id='line_857'>      prostrate, Barbarian; and the suppliant Vandals, who could be</a>
<a id='line_858'>      found only in churches, were protected by his authority,</a>
<a id='line_859'>      disarmed, and separately confined, that they might neither</a>
<a id='line_860'>      disturb the public peace, nor become the victims of popular</a>
<a id='line_861'>      revenge. After despatching a light detachment to tread the</a>
<a id='line_862'>      footsteps of Gelimer, he advanced, with his whole army, about ten</a>
<a id='line_863'>      days’ march, as far as Hippo Regius, which no longer possessed</a>
<a id='line_864'>      the relics of St. Augustin. 22 The season, and the certain</a>
<a id='line_865'>      intelligence that the Vandal had fled to an inaccessible country</a>
<a id='line_866'>      of the Moors, determined Belisarius to relinquish the vain</a>
<a id='line_867'>      pursuit, and to fix his winter quarters at Carthage. From thence</a>
<a id='line_868'>      he despatched his principal lieutenant, to inform the emperor,</a>
<a id='line_869'>      that in the space of three months he had achieved the conquest of</a>

<a id='line_904'>      in looser geography may be confounded with the modern Algiers,</a>
<a id='line_905'>      was situate thirty days’ march to the westward of Carthage: by</a>
<a id='line_906'>      land, the road was infested by the Moors; but the sea was open,</a>
<a id='line_907'>      and the Romans were now masters of the sea. An active and</a>
<a id='line_908'>      discreet tribune sailed as far as the Straits, where he occupied</a>
<a id='line_909'>      Septem or Ceuta, 23 which rises opposite to Gibraltar on the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      African coast; that remote place was afterwards adorned and</a>
<a id='line_911'>      fortified by Justinian; and he seems to have indulged the vain</a>
<a id='line_912'>      ambition of extending his empire to the columns of Hercules. He</a>
<a id='line_913'>      received the messengers of victory at the time when he was</a>
<a id='line_914'>      preparing to publish the Pandects of the Roman laws; and the</a>
<a id='line_915'>      devout or jealous emperor celebrated the divine goodness, and</a>
<a id='line_916'>      confessed, in silence, the merit of his successful general. 24</a>
<a id='line_917'>      Impatient to abolish the temporal and spiritual tyranny of the</a>
<a id='line_918'>      Vandals, he proceeded, without delay, to the full establishment</a>
<a id='line_919'>      of the Catholic church. Her jurisdiction, wealth, and immunites,</a>
<a id='line_920'>      perhaps the most essential part of episcopal religion, were</a>
<a id='line_921'>      restored and amplified with a liberal hand; the Arian worship was</a>
<a id='line_922'>      suppressed; the Donatist meetings were proscribed; 25 and the</a>
<a id='line_923'>      synod of Carthage, by the voice of two hundred and seventeen</a>
<a id='line_924'>      bishops, 26 applauded the just measure of pious retaliation. On</a>
<a id='line_925'>      such an occasion, it may not be presumed, that many orthodox</a>
<a id='line_926'>      prelates were absent; but the comparative smallness of their</a>
<a id='line_927'>      number, which in ancient councils had been twice or even thrice</a>
<a id='line_928'>      multiplied, most clearly indicates the decay both of the church</a>
<a id='line_929'>      and state. While Justinian approved himself the defender of the</a>
<a id='line_930'>      faith, he entertained an ambitious hope, that his victorious</a>
<a id='line_931'>      lieutenant would speedily enlarge the narrow limits of his</a>
<a id='line_932'>      dominion to the space which they occupied before the invasion of</a>
<a id='line_933'>      the Moors and Vandals; and Belisarius was instructed to establish</a>
<a id='line_934'>      five dukes or commanders in the convenient stations of Tripoli,</a>
<a id='line_935'>      Leptis, Cirta, Caesarea, and Sardinia, and to compute the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      military force of palatines or borderers that might be sufficient</a>
<a id='line_937'>      for the defence of Africa. The kingdom of the Vandals was not</a>
<a id='line_938'>      unworthy of the presence of a Praetorian praefect; and four</a>
<a id='line_939'>      consulars, three presidents, were appointed to administer the</a>
<a id='line_940'>      seven provinces under his civil jurisdiction. The number of their</a>
<a id='line_941'>      subordinate officers, clerks, messengers, or assistants, was</a>
<a id='line_942'>      minutely expressed; three hundred and ninety-six for the praefect</a>
<a id='line_943'>      himself, fifty for each of his vicegerents; and the rigid</a>
<a id='line_944'>      definition of their fees and salaries was more effectual to</a>
<a id='line_945'>      confirm the right than to prevent the abuse. These magistrates</a>
<a id='line_946'>      might be oppressive, but they were not idle; and the subtile</a>
<a id='line_947'>      questions of justice and revenue were infinitely propagated under</a>
<a id='line_948'>      the new government, which professed to revive the freedom and</a>
<a id='line_949'>      equity of the Roman republic. The conqueror was solicitous to</a>
<a id='line_950'>      extract a prompt and plentiful supply from his African subjects;</a>
<a id='line_951'>      and he allowed them to claim, even in the third degree, and from</a>
<a id='line_952'>      the collateral line, the houses and lands of which their families</a>
<a id='line_953'>      had been unjustly despoiled by the Vandals. After the departure</a>

<a id='line_1002'>      important charge and, after a bold attempt to scale the mountain,</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      in which he lost a hundred and ten soldiers, Pharas expected,</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      during a winter siege, the operation of distress and famine on</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      the mind of the Vandal king. From the softest habits of pleasure,</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      from the unbounded command of industry and wealth, he was reduced</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      to share the poverty of the Moors, 29 supportable only to</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      themselves by their ignorance of a happier condition. In their</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      rude hovels, of mud and hurdles, which confined the smoke and</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      excluded the light, they promiscuously slept on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      perhaps on a sheep-skin, with their wives, their children, and</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      their cattle. Sordid and scanty were their garments; the use of</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      bread and wine was unknown; and their oaten or barley cakes,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      imperfectly baked in the ashes, were devoured almost in a crude</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      state, by the hungry savages. The health of Gelimer must have</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      sunk under these strange and unwonted hardships, from whatsoever</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      cause they had been endured; but his actual misery was imbittered</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      by the recollection of past greatness, the daily insolence of his</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      protectors, and the just apprehension, that the light and venal</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      Moors might be tempted to betray the rights of hospitality. The</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      knowledge of his situation dictated the humane and friendly</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      epistle of Pharas. “Like yourself,” said the chief of the Heruli,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      “I am an illiterate Barbarian, but I speak the language of plain</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      sense and an honest heart. Why will you persist in hopeless</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      obstinacy? Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      The love of freedom and abhorrence of slavery? Alas! my dearest</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      Gelimer, are you not already the worst of slaves, the slave of</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      the vile nation of the Moors? Would it not be preferable to</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      sustain at Constantinople a life of poverty and servitude, rather</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      than to reign the undoubted monarch of the mountain of Papua? Do</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      you think it a disgrace to be the subject of Justinian?</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      Belisarius is his subject; and we ourselves, whose birth is not</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      inferior to your own, are not ashamed of our obedience to the</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      Roman emperor. That generous prince will grant you a rich</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      inheritance of lands, a place in the senate, and the dignity of</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      patrician: such are his gracious intentions, and you may depend</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      with full assurance on the word of Belisarius. So long as Heaven</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      has condemned us to suffer, patience is a virtue; but if we</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      reject the proffered deliverance, it degenerates into blind and</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      stupid despair.” “I am not insensible” replied the king of the</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      Vandals, “how kind and rational is your advice. But I cannot</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      persuade myself to become the slave of an unjust enemy, who has</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      deserved my implacable hatred. Him I had never injured either by</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      word or deed: yet he has sent against me, I know not from whence,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      a certain Belisarius, who has cast me headlong from the throne</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      into his abyss of misery. Justinian is a man; he is a prince;</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      does he not dread for himself a similar reverse of fortune? I can</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      write no more: my grief oppresses me. Send me, I beseech you, my</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      dear Pharas, send me, a lyre, 30 a sponge, and a loaf of bread.”</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      From the Vandal messenger, Pharas was informed of the motives of</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      this singular request. It was long since the king of Africa had</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      tasted bread; a defluxion had fallen on his eyes, the effect of</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      fatigue or incessant weeping; and he wished to solace the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      melancholy hours, by singing to the lyre the sad story of his own</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      misfortunes. The humanity of Pharas was moved; he sent the three</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      extraordinary gifts; but even his humanity prompted him to</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      redouble the vigilance of his guard, that he might sooner compel</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      his prisoner to embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      but salutary to himself. The obstinacy of Gelimer at length</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      yielded to reason and necessity; the solemn assurances of safety</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      and honorable treatment were ratified in the emperor’s name, by</a>

<a id='line_1063'>      descended from the mountain. The first public interview was in</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      one of the suburbs of Carthage; and when the royal captive</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      accosted his conqueror, he burst into a fit of laughter. The</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      crowd might naturally believe, that extreme grief had deprived</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      Gelimer of his senses: but in this mournful state, unseasonable</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers, that the vain and</a>

<a id='line_1104'>      silence was the result of jealousy rather than of confidence. An</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      honorable alternative, of remaining in the province, or of</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      returning to the capital, was indeed submitted to the discretion</a>

<a id='line_1109'>      resign his head, erect his standard, or confound his enemies by</a>

<a id='line_1113'>      at Constantinople preceded any certain account of his departure</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      from the port of Carthage. Such unsuspecting loyalty removed the</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      apprehensions of Justinian; envy was silenced and inflamed by the</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      public gratitude; and the third Africanus obtained the honors of</a>

<a id='line_1119'>      reserved for the auspicious arms of the Caesars. From the palace</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      of Belisarius, the procession was conducted through the principal</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      streets to the hippodrome; and this memorable day seemed to</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      avenge the injuries of Genseric, and to expiate the shame of the</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      Romans. The wealth of nations was displayed, the trophies of</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      martial or effeminate luxury; rich armor, golden thrones, and the</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      chariots of state which had been used by the Vandal queen; the</a>

<a id='line_1131'>      the noblest Vandals reluctantly exposed their lofty stature and</a>

<a id='line_1133'>      purple robe, and still maintained the majesty of a king. Not a</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      tear escaped from his eyes, not a sigh was heard; but his pride</a>

<a id='line_1136'>      Solomon, 33 which he repeatedly pronounced, Vanity! vanity! all</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      is vanity! Instead of ascending a triumphal car drawn by four</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      horses or elephants, the modest conqueror marched on foot at the</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      head of his brave companions; his prudence might decline an honor</a>

<a id='line_1151'>      trained to servitude, the genius of Belisarius must have secretly</a>

<a id='line_1153'>      year, and the day of his inauguration resembled the pomp of a</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      second triumph: his curule chair was borne aloft on the shoulders</a>

<a id='line_1182'>      Although Theodatus descended from a race of heroes, he was</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      ignorant of the art, and averse to the dangers, of war. Although</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      he had studied the writings of Plato and Tully, philosophy was</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      incapable of purifying his mind from the basest passions, avarice</a>

<a id='line_1188'>      that of a nation, which already disdained their unworthy</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      sovereign. Astonished by the recent example of Gelimer, he saw</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      himself dragged in chains through the streets of Constantinople:</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      the terrors which Belisarius inspired were heightened by the</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      eloquence of Peter, the Byzantine ambassador; and that bold and</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      subtle advocate persuaded him to sign a treaty, too ignominious</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      to become the foundation of a lasting peace. It was stipulated,</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      that in the acclamations of the Roman people, the name of the</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      emperor should be always proclaimed before that of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      king; and that as often as the statue of Theodatus was erected in</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      brass on marble, the divine image of Justinian should be placed</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      on its right hand. Instead of conferring, the king of Italy was</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      reduced to solicit, the honors of the senate; and the consent of</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      the emperor was made indispensable before he could execute,</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      against a priest or senator, the sentence either of death or</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      confiscation. The feeble monarch resigned the possession of</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      Sicily; offered, as the annual mark of his dependence, a crown of</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      gold of the weight of three hundred pounds; and promised to</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      supply, at the requisition of his sovereign, three thousand</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      Gothic auxiliaries, for the service of the empire. Satisfied with</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      these extraordinary concessions, the successful agent of</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      Justinian hastened his journey to Constantinople; but no sooner</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      had he reached the Alban villa, 60 than he was recalled by the</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      anxiety of Theodatus; and the dialogue which passed between the</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      king and the ambassador deserves to be represented in its</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      original simplicity. “Are you of opinion that the emperor will</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      ratify this treaty? Perhaps. If he refuses, what consequence will</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      ensue? War. Will such a war, be just or reasonable? Most</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      assuredly: every to his character. What is your meaning? You are</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      a philosopher—Justinian is emperor of the Romans: it would all</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      become the disciple of Plato to shed the blood of thousands in</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      his private quarrel: the successor of Augustus should vindicate</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      his rights, and recover by arms the ancient provinces of his</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      empire.” This reasoning might not convince, but it was sufficient</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      to alarm and subdue the weakness of Theodatus; and he soon</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      descended to his last offer, that for the poor equivalent of a</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      pension of forty-eight thousand pounds sterling, he would resign</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      the kingdom of the Goths and Italians, and spend the remainder of</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      his days in the innocent pleasures of philosophy and agriculture.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>      Both treaties were intrusted to the hands of the ambassador, on</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      the frail security of an oath not to produce the second till the</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      first had been positively rejected. The event may be easily</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      foreseen: Justinian required and accepted the abdication of the</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      Gothic king. His indefatigable agent returned from Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      to Ravenna, with ample instructions; and a fair epistle, which</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      praised the wisdom and generosity of the royal philosopher,</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      granted his pension, with the assurance of such honors as a</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      subject and a Catholic might enjoy; and wisely referred the final</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      execution of the treaty to the presence and authority of</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      Belisarius. But in the interval of suspense, two Roman generals,</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      who had entered the province of Dalmatia, were defeated and slain</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      by the Gothic troops. From blind and abject despair, Theodatus</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      capriciously rose to groundless and fatal presumption, 61 and</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      dared to receive, with menace and contempt, the ambassador of</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      Justinian; who claimed his promise, solicited the allegiance of</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      his subjects, and boldly asserted the inviolable privilege of his</a>

<a id='line_1302'>      audience to the deputies of the people, who exhorted him to</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      disregard a conquest unworthy of his arms, to seek the Gothic</a>

<a id='line_1306'>      “When I treat with my enemies,” replied the Roman chief, with a</a>

<a id='line_1309'>      peace and freedom, such as Sicily now enjoys.” The impatience of</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      delay urged him to grant the most liberal terms; his honor</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      secured their performance: but Naples was divided into two</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      factions; and the Greek democracy was inflamed by their orators,</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      who, with much spirit and some truth, represented to the</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      multitude that the Goths would punish their defection, and that</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      Belisarius himself must esteem their loyalty and valor. Their</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      deliberations, however, were not perfectly free: the city was</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      commanded by eight hundred Barbarians, whose wives and children</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      were detained at Ravenna as the pledge of their fidelity; and</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      even the Jews, who were rich and numerous, resisted, with</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      desperate enthusiasm, the intolerant laws of Justinian. In a much</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      later period, the circumference of Naples 67 measured only two</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      thousand three hundred and sixty three paces: 68 the</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      fortifications were defended by precipices or the sea; when the</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      aqueducts were intercepted, a supply of water might be drawn from</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      wells and fountains; and the stock of provisions was sufficient</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      to consume the patience of the besiegers. At the end of twenty</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      days, that of Belisarius was almost exhausted, and he had</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      reconciled himself to the disgrace of abandoning the siege, that</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      he might march, before the winter season, against Rome and the</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      Gothic king. But his anxiety was relieved by the bold curiosity</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      of an Isaurian, who explored the dry channel of an aqueduct, and</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      secretly reported, that a passage might be perforated to</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      introduce a file of armed soldiers into the heart of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      When the work had been silently executed, the humane general</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      risked the discovery of his secret by a last and fruitless</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      admonition of the impending danger. In the darkness of the night,</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      four hundred Romans entered the aqueduct, raised themselves by a</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      rope, which they fastened to an olive-tree, into the house or</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      garden of a solitary matron, sounded their trumpets, surprised</a>

<a id='line_1341'>      all sides scaled the walls, and burst open the gates of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      Every crime which is punished by social justice was practised as</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      the rights of war; the Huns were distinguished by cruelty and</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      sacrilege, and Belisarius alone appeared in the streets and</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      churches of Naples to moderate the calamities which he predicted.</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      “The gold and silver,” he repeatedly exclaimed, “are the just</a>

<a id='line_1437'>      the wishes, of the Romans. But a momentary enthusiasm of religion</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      and patriotism was kindled in their minds. They furiously</a>

<a id='line_1442'>      and, without reflecting, that Italy must sink into a province of</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      Constantinople, they fondly hailed the restoration of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      emperor as a new aera of freedom and prosperity. The deputies of</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      the pope and clergy, of the senate and people, invited the</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      lieutenant of Justinian to accept their voluntary allegiance, and</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      to enter the city, whose gates would be thrown open for his</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      reception. As soon as Belisarius had fortified his new conquests,</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      Naples and Cumae, he advanced about twenty miles to the banks of</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      the Vulturnus, contemplated the decayed grandeur of Capua, and</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      halted at the separation of the Latin and Appian ways. The work</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      of the censor, after the incessant use of nine centuries, still</a>

<a id='line_1456'>      however, preferred the Latin way, which, at a distance from the</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      sea and the marshes, skirted in a space of one hundred and twenty</a>

<a id='line_1515'>      their country; and such were their numbers, that, after an army</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      had been detached for the relief of Dalmatia, one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      fifty thousand fighting men marched under the royal standard.</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      According to the degrees of rank or merit, the Gothic king</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      distributed arms and horses, rich gifts, and liberal promises; he</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      moved along the Flaminian way, declined the useless sieges of</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      Perusia and Spoleto, respected he impregnable rock of Narni, and</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      arrived within two miles of Rome at the foot of the Milvian</a>

<a id='line_1524'>      Belisarius had computed the value of the twenty days which must</a>

<a id='line_1526'>      consternation of the soldiers of the tower, who either fled or</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      deserted, disappointed his hopes, and betrayed his person into</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      the most imminent danger. At the head of one thousand horse, the</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      Roman general sallied from the Flaminian gate to mark the ground</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      of an advantageous position, and to survey the camp of the</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      Barbarians; but while he still believed them on the other side of</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      the Tyber, he was suddenly encompassed and assaulted by their</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      numerous squadrons. The fate of Italy depended on his life; and</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      the deserters pointed to the conspicuous horse a bay, 75 with a</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      white face, which he rode on that memorable day. “Aim at the bay</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      horse,” was the universal cry. Every bow was bent, every javelin</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      was directed, against that fatal object, and the command was</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      repeated and obeyed by thousands who were ignorant of its real</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      motive. The bolder Barbarians advanced to the more honorable</a>

<a id='line_1541'>      graced the fall of Visandus, the standard-bearer, 76 who</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      maintained his foremost station, till he was pierced with</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      thirteen wounds, perhaps by the hand of Belisarius himself. The</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      Roman general was strong, active, and dexterous; on every side he</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      discharged his weighty and mortal strokes: his faithful guards</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      imitated his valor, and defended his person; and the Goths, after</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      the loss of a thousand men, fled before the arms of a hero. They</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      were rashly pursued to their camp; and the Romans, oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      multitudes, made a gradual, and at length a precipitate retreat</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      to the gates of the city: the gates were shut against the</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      fugitives; and the public terror was increased, by the report</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      that Belisarius was slain. His countenance was indeed disfigured</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      by sweat, dust, and blood; his voice was hoarse, his strength was</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      almost exhausted; but his unconquerable spirit still remained; he</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      imparted that spirit to his desponding companions; and their last</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      desperate charge was felt by the flying Barbarians, as if a new</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      army, vigorous and entire, had been poured from the city. The</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      Flaminian gate was thrown open to a real triumph; but it was not</a>

<a id='line_1721'>      described the ancient rite like a poet and an antiquarian.]</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      Eighteen days were employed by the besiegers, to provide all the</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      instruments of attack which antiquity had invented. Fascines were</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      prepared to fill the ditches, scaling-ladders to ascend the</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      walls. The largest trees of the forest supplied the timbers of</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      four battering-rams: their heads were armed with iron; they were</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      suspended by ropes, and each of them was worked by the labor of</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      fifty men. The lofty wooden turrets moved on wheels or rollers,</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      and formed a spacious platform of the level of the rampart. On</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      the morning of the nineteenth day, a general attack was made from</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      the Praenestine gate to the Vatican: seven Gothic columns, with</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      their military engines, advanced to the assault; and the Romans,</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      who lined the ramparts, listened with doubt and anxiety to the</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      cheerful assurances of their commander. As soon as the enemy</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      approached the ditch, Belisarius himself drew the first arrow;</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      and such was his strength and dexterity, that he transfixed the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      foremost of the Barbarian leaders.</a>
<a id='line_1738'></a>
<a id='line_1739'>      A shout of applause and victory was reechoed along the wall. He</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      drew a second arrow, and the stroke was followed with the same</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      success and the same acclamation. The Roman general then gave the</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      word, that the archers should aim at the teams of oxen; they were</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      instantly covered with mortal wounds; the towers which they drew</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      remained useless and immovable, and a single moment disconcerted</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      the laborious projects of the king of the Goths. After this</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      disappointment, Vitiges still continued, or feigned to continue,</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      the assault of the Salarian gate, that he might divert the</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      attention of his adversary, while his principal forces more</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      strenuously attacked the Praenestine gate and the sepulchre of</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      Hadrian, at the distance of three miles from each other. Near the</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      former, the double walls of the Vivarium 85 were low or broken;</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      the fortifications of the latter were feebly guarded: the vigor</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      of the Goths was excited by the hope of victory and spoil; and if</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      a single post had given way, the Romans, and Rome itself, were</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      irrecoverably lost. This perilous day was the most glorious in</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      the life of Belisarius. Amidst tumult and dismay, the whole plan</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      of the attack and defence was distinctly present to his mind; he</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      observed the changes of each instant, weighed every possible</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      advantage, transported his person to the scenes of danger, and</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      communicated his spirit in calm and decisive orders. The contest</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      was fiercely maintained from the morning to the evening; the</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      Goths were repulsed on all sides; and each Roman might boast that</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      he had vanquished thirty Barbarians, if the strange disproportion</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      of numbers were not counterbalanced by the merit of one man.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      Thirty thousand Goths, according to the confession of their own</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      chiefs, perished in this bloody action; and the multitude of the</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      wounded was equal to that of the slain. When they advanced to the</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      assault, their close disorder suffered not a javelin to fall</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      without effect; and as they retired, the populace of the city</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      joined the pursuit, and slaughtered, with impunity, the backs of</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      their flying enemies. Belisarius instantly sallied from the</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      gates; and while the soldiers chanted his name and victory, the</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      hostile engines of war were reduced to ashes. Such was the loss</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      and consternation of the Goths, that, from this day, the siege of</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      Rome degenerated into a tedious and indolent blockade; and they</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      were incessantly harassed by the Roman general, who, in frequent</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      skirmishes, destroyed above five thousand of their bravest</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      troops. Their cavalry was unpractised in the use of the bow;</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      their archers served on foot; and this divided force was</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      incapable of contending with their adversaries, whose lances and</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      arrows, at a distance, or at hand, were alike formidable. The</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      consummate skill of Belisarius embraced the favorable</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      opportunities; and as he chose the ground and the moment, as he</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      pressed the charge or sounded the retreat, 86 the squadrons which</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      he detached were seldom unsuccessful. These partial advantages</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      diffused an impatient ardor among the soldiers and people, who</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      began to feel the hardships of a siege, and to disregard the</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      dangers of a general engagement. Each plebeian conceived himself</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      to be a hero, and the infantry, who, since the decay of</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      discipline, were rejected from the line of battle, aspired to the</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      ancient honors of the Roman legion. Belisarius praised the spirit</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      of his troops, condemned their presumption, yielded to their</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      clamors, and prepared the remedies of a defeat, the possibility</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      of which he alone had courage to suspect. In the quarter of the</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      Vatican, the Romans prevailed; and if the irreparable moments had</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      not been wasted in the pillage of the camp, they might have</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      occupied the Milvian bridge, and charged in the rear of the</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      Gothic host. On the other side of the Tyber, Belisarius advanced</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      from the Pincian and Salarian gates. But his army, four thousand</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      soldiers perhaps, was lost in a spacious plain; they were</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      encompassed and oppressed by fresh multitudes, who continually</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      relieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians. The valiant leaders</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      of the infantry were unskilled to conquer; they died: the retreat</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      (a hasty retreat) was covered by the prudence of the general, and</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      the victors started back with affright from the formidable aspect</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      of an armed rampart. The reputation of Belisarius was unsullied</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      by a defeat; and the vain confidence of the Goths was not less</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      serviceable to his designs than the repentance and modesty of the</a>

<a id='line_1827'>      IV.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>      From the moment that Belisarius had determined to sustain a</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      siege, his assiduous care provided Rome against the danger of</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      famine, more dreadful than the Gothic arms. An extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      supply of corn was imported from Sicily: the harvests of Campania</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      and Tuscany were forcibly swept for the use of the city; and the</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      rights of private property were infringed by the strong plea of</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      the public safety. It might easily be foreseen that the enemy</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      would intercept the aqueducts; and the cessation of the</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      water-mills was the first inconvenience, which was speedily</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      removed by mooring large vessels, and fixing mill-stones in the</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      current of the river. The stream was soon embarrassed by the</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      trunks of trees, and polluted with dead bodies; yet so effectual</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      were the precautions of the Roman general, that the waters of the</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      Tyber still continued to give motion to the mills and drink to</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      the inhabitants: the more distant quarters were supplied from</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      domestic wells; and a besieged city might support, without</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      impatience, the privation of her public baths. A large portion of</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      Rome, from the Praenestine gate to the church of St. Paul, was</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      never invested by the Goths; their excursions were restrained by</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      the activity of the Moorish troops: the navigation of the Tyber,</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      and the Latin, Appian, and Ostian ways, were left free and</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      unmolested for the introduction of corn and cattle, or the</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      retreat of the inhabitants, who sought refuge in Campania or</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      Sicily. Anxious to relieve himself from a useless and devouring</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      multitude, Belisarius issued his peremptory orders for the</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      instant departure of the women, the children, and slaves;</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      required his soldiers to dismiss their male and female</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      attendants, and regulated their allowance that one moiety should</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      be given in provisions, and the other in money. His foresight was</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      justified by the increase of the public distress, as soon as the</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      Goths had occupied two important posts in the neighborhood of</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      Rome. By the loss of the port, or, as it is now called, the city</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      of Porto, he was deprived of the country on the right of the</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      Tyber, and the best communication with the sea; and he reflected,</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      with grief and anger, that three hundred men, could he have</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      spared such a feeble band, might have defended its impregnable</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      works. Seven miles from the capital, between the Appian and the</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      Latin ways, two principal aqueducts crossing, and again crossing</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      each other: enclosed within their solid and lofty arches a</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      fortified space, 87 where Vitiges established a camp of seven</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      thousand Goths to intercept the convoy of Sicily and Campania.</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      The granaries of Rome were insensibly exhausted, the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      country had been wasted with fire and sword; such scanty supplies</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      as might yet be obtained by hasty excursions were the reward of</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      valor, and the purchase of wealth: the forage of the horses, and</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      the bread of the soldiers, never failed: but in the last months</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      of the siege, the people were exposed to the miseries of</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      scarcity, unwholesome food, 88 and contagious disorders.</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      Belisarius saw and pitied their sufferings; but he had foreseen,</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      and he watched the decay of their loyalty, and the progress of</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      their discontent. Adversity had awakened the Romans from the</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      dreams of grandeur and freedom, and taught them the humiliating</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      lesson, that it was of small moment to their real happiness,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      whether the name of their master was derived from the Gothic or</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      the Latin language. The lieutenant of Justinian listened to their</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      just complaints, but he rejected with disdain the idea of flight</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      or capitulation; repressed their clamorous impatience for battle;</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      amused them with the prospect of a sure and speedy relief; and</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      secured himself and the city from the effects of their despair or</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      treachery. Twice in each month he changed the station of the</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      officers to whom the custody of the gates was committed: the</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      various precautions of patroles, watch words, lights, and music,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      were repeatedly employed to discover whatever passed on the</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      ramparts; out-guards were posted beyond the ditch, and the trusty</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      vigilance of dogs supplied the more doubtful fidelity of mankind.</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      A letter was intercepted, which assured the king of the Goths</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      that the Asinarian gate, adjoining to the Lateran church, should</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      be secretly opened to his troops. On the proof or suspicion of</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      treason, several senators were banished, and the pope Sylverius</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      was summoned to attend the representative of his sovereign, at</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      his head-quarters in the Pincian palace. 89 The ecclesiastics,</a>

<a id='line_1963'>      these conquests will be more disgraceful than their acquisition</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      was glorious. Hitherto we have successfully fought against the</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      multitudes of the Barbarians, but their multitudes may finally</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      prevail. Victory is the gift of Providence, but the reputation of</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      kings and generals depends on the success or the failure of their</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      designs. Permit me to speak with freedom: if you wish that we</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      should live, send us subsistence; if you desire that we should</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      conquer, send us arms, horses, and men. The Romans have received</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      us as friends and deliverers: but in our present distress, they</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      will be either betrayed by their confidence, or we shall be</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      oppressed by their treachery and hatred. For myself, my life is</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      consecrated to your service: it is yours to reflect, whether my</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      death in this situation will contribute to the glory and</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      prosperity of your reign.” Perhaps that reign would have been</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      equally prosperous if the peaceful master of the East had</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      abstained from the conquest of Africa and Italy: but as Justinian</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      was ambitious of fame, he made some efforts (they were feeble and</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      languid) to support and rescue his victorious general. A</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      reenforcement of sixteen hundred Sclavonians and Huns was led by</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      Martin and Valerian; and as they reposed during the winter season</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      in the harbors of Greece, the strength of the men and horses was</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      not impaired by the fatigues of a sea-voyage; and they</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      distinguished their valor in the first sally against the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      besiegers. About the time of the summer solstice, Euthalius</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      landed at Terracina with large sums of money for the payment of</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      the troops: he cautiously proceeded along the Appian way, and</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      this convoy entered Rome through the gate Capena, 92 while</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      Belisarius, on the other side, diverted the attention of the</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      Goths by a vigorous and successful skirmish. These seasonable</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      aids, the use and reputation of which were dexterously managed by</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      the Roman general, revived the courage, or at least the hopes, of</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      the soldiers and people. The historian Procopius was despatched</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      with an important commission to collect the troops and provisions</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      which Campania could furnish, or Constantinople had sent; and the</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      secretary of Belisarius was soon followed by Antonina herself, 93</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      who boldly traversed the posts of the enemy, and returned with</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      the Oriental succors to the relief of her husband and the</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      besieged city. A fleet of three thousand Isaurians cast anchor in</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      the Bay of Naples and afterwards at Ostia. Above two thousand</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      horse, of whom a part were Thracians, landed at Tarentum; and,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      after the junction of five hundred soldiers of Campania, and a</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      train of wagons laden with wine and flour, they directed their</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      march on the Appian way, from Capua to the neighborhood of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      The forces that arrived by land and sea were united at the mouth</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      of the Tyber. Antonina convened a council of war: it was resolved</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      to surmount, with sails and oars, the adverse stream of the</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      river; and the Goths were apprehensive of disturbing, by any rash</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      hostilities, the negotiation to which Belisarius had craftily</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      listened. They credulously believed that they saw no more than</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      the vanguard of a fleet and army, which already covered the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      Ionian Sea and the plains of Campania; and the illusion was</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      supported by the haughty language of the Roman general, when he</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      gave audience to the ambassadors of Vitiges. After a specious</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      discourse to vindicate the justice of his cause, they declared,</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      that, for the sake of peace, they were disposed to renounce the</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      possession of Sicily. “The emperor is not less generous,” replied</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      his lieutenant, with a disdainful smile, “in return for a gift</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      which you no longer possess: he presents you with an ancient</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      province of the empire; he resigns to the Goths the sovereignty</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      of the British island.” Belisarius rejected with equal firmness</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      and contempt the offer of a tribute; but he allowed the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      ambassadors to seek their fate from the mouth of Justinian</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      himself; and consented, with seeming reluctance, to a truce of</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      three months, from the winter solstice to the equinox of spring.</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      Prudence might not safely trust either the oaths or hostages of</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      the Barbarians, and the conscious superiority of the Roman chief</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      was expressed in the distribution of his troops. As soon as fear</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      or hunger compelled the Goths to evacuate Alba, Porto, and</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      Centumcellae, their place was instantly supplied; the garrisons</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      of Narni, Spoleto, and Perusia, were reenforced, and the seven</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      camps of the besiegers were gradually encompassed with the</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      calamities of a siege. The prayers and pilgrimage of Datius,</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      bishop of Milan, were not without effect; and he obtained one</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      thousand Thracians and Isaurians, to assist the revolt of Liguria</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      against her Arian tyrant. At the same time, John the Sanguinary,</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      94 the nephew of Vitalian, was detached with two thousand chosen</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      horse, first to Alba, on the Fucine Lake, and afterwards to the</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      frontiers of Picenum, on the Hadriatic Sea. “In the province,”</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      said Belisarius, “the Goths have deposited their families and</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      treasures, without a guard or the suspicion of danger. Doubtless</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      they will violate the truce: let them feel your presence, before</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      they hear of your motions. Spare the Italians; suffer not any</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      fortified places to remain hostile in your rear; and faithfully</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      reserve the spoil for an equal and common partition. It would not</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      be reasonable,” he added with a laugh, “that whilst we are</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      toiling to the destruction of the drones, our more fortunate</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      brethren should rifle and enjoy the honey.”</a>

<a id='line_2063'>      The whole nation of the Ostrogoths had been assembled for the</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      attack, and was almost entirely consumed in the siege of Rome. If</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      any credit be due to an intelligent spectator, one third at least</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      of their enormous host was destroyed, in frequent and bloody</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      combats under the walls of the city. The bad fame and pernicious</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      qualities of the summer air might already be imputed to the decay</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      of agriculture and population; and the evils of famine and</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      pestilence were aggravated by their own licentiousness, and the</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      unfriendly disposition of the country. While Vitiges struggled</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      with his fortune, while he hesitated between shame and ruin, his</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      retreat was hastened by domestic alarms. The king of the Goths</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      was informed by trembling messengers, that John the Sanguinary</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      spread the devastations of war from the Apennine to the</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      Hadriatic; that the rich spoils and innumerable captives of</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      Picenum were lodged in the fortifications of Rimini; and that</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      this formidable chief had defeated his uncle, insulted his</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      capital, and seduced, by secret correspondence, the fidelity of</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      his wife, the imperious daughter of Amalasontha. Yet, before he</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      retired, Vitiges made a last effort, either to storm or to</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      surprise the city. A secret passage was discovered in one of the</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      aqueducts; two citizens of the Vatican were tempted by bribes to</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      intoxicate the guards of the Aurelian gate; an attack was</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      meditated on the walls beyond the Tyber, in a place which was not</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      fortified with towers; and the Barbarians advanced, with torches</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      and scaling-ladders, to the assault of the Pincian gate. But</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      every attempt was defeated by the intrepid vigilance of</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      Belisarius and his band of veterans, who, in the most perilous</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      moments, did not regret the absence of their companions; and the</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      Goths, alike destitute of hope and subsistence, clamorously urged</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      their departure before the truce should expire, and the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      cavalry should again be united. One year and nine days after the</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      commencement of the siege, an army, so lately strong and</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      triumphant, burnt their tents, and tumultuously repassed the</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      Milvian bridge. They repassed not with impunity: their thronging</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      multitudes, oppressed in a narrow passage, were driven headlong</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      into the Tyber, by their own fears and the pursuit of the enemy;</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      and the Roman general, sallying from the Pincian gate, inflicted</a>
<a id='line_2100'>      a severe and disgraceful wound on their retreat. The slow length</a>
<a id='line_2101'>      of a sickly and desponding host was heavily dragged along the</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      Flaminian way; from whence the Barbarians were sometimes</a>
<a id='line_2103'>      compelled to deviate, lest they should encounter the hostile</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      garrisons that guarded the high road to Rimini and Ravenna. Yet</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      so powerful was this flying army, that Vitiges spared ten</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      thousand men for the defence of the cities which he was most</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      solicitous to preserve, and detached his nephew Uraias, with an</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      adequate force, for the chastisement of rebellious Milan. At the</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      head of his principal army, he besieged Rimini, only thirty-three</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      miles distant from the Gothic capital. A feeble rampart, and a</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      shallow ditch, were maintained by the skill and valor of John the</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      Sanguinary, who shared the danger and fatigue of the meanest</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      soldier, and emulated, on a theatre less illustrious, the</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      military virtues of his great commander. The towers and</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      battering-engines of the Barbarians were rendered useless; their</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      attacks were repulsed; and the tedious blockade, which reduced</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      the garrison to the last extremity of hunger, afforded time for</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      the union and march of the Roman forces. A fleet, which had</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      surprised Ancona, sailed along the coast of the Hadriatic, to the</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      relief of the besieged city. The eunuch Narses landed in Picenum</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      with two thousand Heruli and five thousand of the bravest troops</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      of the East. The rock of the Apennine was forced; ten thousand</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      veterans moved round the foot of the mountains, under the command</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      of Belisarius himself; and a new army, whose encampment blazed</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      with innumerable lights, appeared to advance along the Flaminian</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      way. Overwhelmed with astonishment and despair, the Goths</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      abandoned the siege of Rimini, their tents, their standards, and</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      their leaders; and Vitiges, who gave or followed the example of</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      flight, never halted till he found a shelter within the walls and</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      morasses of Ravenna. To these walls, and to some fortresses</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      destitute of any mutual support, the Gothic monarchy was now</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      reduced. The provinces of Italy had embraced the party of the</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      emperor and his army, gradually recruited to the number of twenty</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      thousand men, must have achieved an easy and rapid conquest, if</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      their invincible powers had not been weakened by the discord of</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      the Roman chiefs. Before the end of the siege, an act of blood,</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      ambiguous and indiscreet, sullied the fair fame of Belisarius.</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      Presidius, a loyal Italian, as he fled from Ravenna to Rome, was</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      rudely stopped by Constantine, the military governor of Spoleto,</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      and despoiled, even in a church, of two daggers richly inlaid</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      with gold and precious stones. As soon as the public danger had</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      subsided, Presidius complained of the loss and injury: his</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      complaint was heard, but the order of restitution was disobeyed</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      by the pride and avarice of the offender. Exasperated by the</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      delay, Presidius boldly arrested the general’s horse as he passed</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      through the forum; and, with the spirit of a citizen, demanded</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      the common benefit of the Roman laws. The honor of Belisarius was</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      engaged; he summoned a council; claimed the obedience of his</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      subordinate officer; and was provoked, by an insolent reply, to</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      call hastily for the presence of his guards. Constantine, viewing</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      their entrance as the signal of death, drew his sword, and rushed</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      on the general, who nimbly eluded the stroke, and was protected</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      by his friends; while the desperate assassin was disarmed,</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      dragged into a neighboring chamber, and executed, or rather</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      murdered, by the guards, at the arbitrary command of Belisarius.</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      95 In this hasty act of violence, the guilt of Constantine was no</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      longer remembered; the despair and death of that valiant officer</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      were secretly imputed to the revenge of Antonina; and each of his</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      colleagues, conscious of the same rapine, was apprehensive of the</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      same fate. The fear of a common enemy suspended the effects of</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      their envy and discontent; but in the confidence of approaching</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      victory, they instigated a powerful rival to oppose the conqueror</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      of Rome and Africa. From the domestic service of the palace, and</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      the administration of the private revenue, Narses the eunuch was</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      suddenly exalted to the head of an army; and the spirit of a</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      hero, who afterwards equalled the merit and glory of Belisarius,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      served only to perplex the operations of the Gothic war. To his</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      prudent counsels, the relief of Rimini was ascribed by the</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      leaders of the discontented faction, who exhorted Narses to</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      assume an independent and separate command. The epistle of</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      Justinian had indeed enjoined his obedience to the general; but</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      the dangerous exception, “as far as may be advantageous to the</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      public service,” reserved some freedom of judgment to the</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      discreet favorite, who had so lately departed from the sacred and</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      familiar conversation of his sovereign. In the exercise of this</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      doubtful right, the eunuch perpetually dissented from the</a>
<a id='line_2177'>      opinions of Belisarius; and, after yielding with reluctance to</a>
<a id='line_2178'>      the siege of Urbino, he deserted his colleague in the night, and</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      marched away to the conquest of the Aemilian province. The fierce</a>
<a id='line_2180'>      and formidable bands of the Heruli were attached to the person of</a>
<a id='line_2181'>      Narses; 96 ten thousand Romans and confederates were persuaded to</a>
<a id='line_2182'>      march under his banners; every malcontent  embraced the fair</a>
<a id='line_2183'>      opportunity of revenging his private or imaginary wrongs; and the</a>
<a id='line_2184'>      remaining troops of Belisarius were divided and dispersed from</a>
<a id='line_2185'>      the garrisons of Sicily to the shores of the Hadriatic. His skill</a>
<a id='line_2186'>      and perseverance overcame every obstacle: Urbino was taken, the</a>
<a id='line_2187'>      sieges of Faesulae Orvieto, and Auximum, were undertaken and</a>
<a id='line_2188'>      vigorously prosecuted; and the eunuch Narses was at length</a>
<a id='line_2189'>      recalled to the domestic cares of the palace. All dissensions</a>
<a id='line_2190'>      were healed, and all opposition was subdued, by the temperate</a>
<a id='line_2191'>      authority of the Roman general, to whom his enemies could not</a>
<a id='line_2192'>      refuse their esteem; and Belisarius inculcated the salutary</a>
<a id='line_2193'>      lesson that the forces of the state should compose one body, and</a>
<a id='line_2194'>      be animated by one soul. But in the interval of discord, the</a>
<a id='line_2195'>      Goths were permitted to breathe; an important season was lost,</a>
<a id='line_2196'>      Milan was destroyed, and the northern provinces of Italy were</a>
<a id='line_2197'>      afflicted by an inundation of the Franks.</a>

<a id='line_2223'>      Theodebert of Austrasia, the most powerful and warlike of the</a>

<a id='line_2237'>      precious spoil, was resigned to the Burgundians; and the houses,</a>

<a id='line_2253'>      dangerous allies. Till he had secured the passage of the Po on</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      the bridge of Pavia, the grandson of Clovis dissembled his</a>

<a id='line_2260'>      Barbarians, whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of</a>

<a id='line_2262'>      Genoa, not yet constructed of marble, is particularly enumerated;</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      and the deaths of thousands, according to the regular practice of</a>

<a id='line_2265'>      sacrifices of women and children, which were performed with</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      impunity in the camp of the most Christian king. If it were not a</a>

<a id='line_2270'>      left destitute of bread or wine, reduced to drink the waters of</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      the Po, and to feed on the flesh of distempered cattle. The</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      dysentery swept away one third of their army; and the clamors of</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      his subjects, who were impatient to pass the Alps, disposed</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      Theodebert to listen with respect to the mild exhortations of</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      Belisarius. The memory of this inglorious and destructive warfare</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      was perpetuated on the medals of Gaul; and Justinian, without</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      unsheathing his sword, assumed the title of conqueror of the</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      Franks. The Merovingian prince was offended by the vanity of the</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      emperor; he affected to pity the fallen fortunes of the Goths;</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      and his insidious offer of a federal union was fortified by the</a>

<a id='line_2347'>      intercepted by one of his guards, who lost, in that pious office,</a>

<a id='line_2349'>      warriors, with those of Faesulae and the Cottian Alps, were among</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      the last who maintained their independence; and their gallant</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      resistance, which almost tired the patience, deserved the esteem,</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      of the conqueror. His prudence refused to subscribe the safe</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      conduct which they asked, to join their brethren of Ravenna; but</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      they saved, by an honorable capitulation, one moiety at least of</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      their wealth, with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      their estates, or enlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      wars. The multitudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      far surpassed the number of the Roman troops; but neither prayers</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      nor defiance, nor the extreme danger of his most faithful</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      subjects, could tempt the Gothic king beyond the fortifications</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      of Ravenna. These fortifications were, indeed, impregnable to the</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      assaults of art or violence; and when Belisarius invested the</a>
<a id='line_2363'>      capital, he was soon convinced that famine only could tame the</a>
<a id='line_2364'>      stubborn spirit of the Barbarians. The sea, the land, and the</a>
<a id='line_2365'>      channels of the Po, were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2366'>      general; and his morality extended the rights of war to the</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      practice of poisoning the waters, 105 and secretly firing the</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      granaries 106 of a besieged city. 107 While he pressed the</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      blockade of Ravenna, he was surprised by the arrival of two</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      ambassadors from Constantinople, with a treaty of peace, which</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      Justinian had imprudently signed, without deigning to consult the</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      author of his victory. By this disgraceful and precarious</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      agreement, Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided, and the</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      provinces beyond the Po were left with the regal title to the</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      successor of Theodoric. The ambassadors were eager to accomplish</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      their salutary commission; the captive Vitiges accepted, with</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      transport, the unexpected offer of a crown; honor was less</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      prevalent among the Goths, than the want and appetite of food;</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      and the Roman chiefs, who murmured at the continuance of the war,</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      professed implicit submission to the commands of the emperor. If</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      Belisarius had possessed only the courage of a soldier, the</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      envious counsels; but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      the magnanimity of a statesman, to sustain alone the danger and</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      merit of generous disobedience. Each of his officers gave a</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      written opinion that the siege of Ravenna was impracticable and</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      hopeless: the general then rejected the treaty of partition, and</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      declared his own resolution of leading Vitiges in chains to the</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      feet of Justinian. The Goths retired with doubt and dismay: this</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      peremptory refusal deprived them of the only signature which they</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      could trust, and filled their minds with a just apprehension,</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of their</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      deplorable state. They compared the fame and fortune of</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      Belisarius with the weakness of their ill-fated king; and the</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      comparison suggested an extraordinary project, to which Vitiges,</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      with apparent resignation, was compelled to acquiesce. Partition</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      would ruin the strength, exile would disgrace the honor, of the</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      nation; but they offered their arms, their treasures, and the</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      fortifications of Ravenna, if Belisarius would disclaim the</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      authority of a master, accept the choice of the Goths, and</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      assume, as he had deserved, the kingdom of Italy. If the false</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      lustre of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      subject, his prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      Barbarians, and his rational ambition would prefer the safe and</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      honorable station of a Roman general. Even the patience and</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      seeming satisfaction with which he entertained a proposal of</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      treason, might be susceptible of a malignant interpretation. But</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own rectitude;</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      he entered into a dark and crooked path, as it might lead to the</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      voluntary submission of the Goths; and his dexterous policy</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes,</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      without engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      treaty which he secretly abhorred. The day of the surrender of</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      Ravenna was stipulated by the Gothic ambassadors: a fleet, laden</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      with provisions, sailed as a welcome guest into the deepest</a>

<a id='line_2417'>      of Italy; and Belisarius, without meeting an enemy, triumphantly</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      marched through the streets of an impregnable city. 108 The</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      Romans were astonished by their success; the multitudes of tall</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      and robust Barbarians were confounded by the image of their own</a>

<a id='line_2487'>      the Gothic war was no longer worthy of his presence: a gracious</a>
<a id='line_2488'>      sovereign was impatient to reward his services, and to consult</a>
<a id='line_2489'>      his wisdom; and he alone was capable of defending the East</a>

<a id='line_2491'>      the suspicion, accepted the excuse, embarked at Ravenna his</a>
<a id='line_2492'>      spoils and trophies; and proved, by his ready obedience, that</a>
<a id='line_2493'>      such an abrupt removal from the government of Italy was not less</a>
<a id='line_2494'>      unjust than it might have been indiscreet. The emperor received</a>
<a id='line_2495'>      with honorable courtesy both Vitiges and his more noble consort;</a>

<a id='line_2500'>      majesty of the throne, and promised to shed their blood in the</a>
<a id='line_2501'>      service of their benefactor. Justinian deposited in the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_2502'>      palace the treasures of the Gothic monarchy. A flattering senate</a>
<a id='line_2503'>      was sometime admitted to gaze on the magnificent spectacle; but</a>
<a id='line_2504'>      it was enviously secluded from the public view: and the conqueror</a>
<a id='line_2505'>      of Italy renounced, without a murmur, perhaps without a sigh, the</a>
<a id='line_2506'>      well-earned honors of a second triumph. His glory was indeed</a>
<a id='line_2507'>      exalted above all external pomp; and the faint and hollow praises</a>
<a id='line_2508'>      of the court were supplied, even in a servile age, by the respect</a>
<a id='line_2509'>      and admiration of his country. Whenever he appeared in the</a>
<a id='line_2510'>      streets and public places of Constantinople, Belisarius attracted</a>
<a id='line_2511'>      and satisfied the eyes of the people. His lofty stature and</a>
<a id='line_2512'>      majestic countenance fulfilled their expectations of a hero; the</a>
<a id='line_2513'>      meanest of his fellow-citizens were emboldened by his gentle and</a>
<a id='line_2514'>      gracious demeanor; and the martial train which attended his</a>
<a id='line_2515'>      footsteps left his person more accessible than in a day of</a>
<a id='line_2516'>      battle. Seven thousand horsemen, matchless for beauty and valor,</a>
<a id='line_2517'>      were maintained in the service, and at the private expense, of</a>
<a id='line_2518'>      the general. 111 Their prowess was always conspicuous in single</a>
<a id='line_2519'>      combats, or in the foremost ranks; and both parties confessed</a>
<a id='line_2520'>      that in the siege of Rome, the guards of Belisarius had alone</a>
<a id='line_2521'>      vanquished the Barbarian host. Their numbers were continually</a>
<a id='line_2522'>      augmented by the bravest and most faithful of the enemy; and his</a>
<a id='line_2523'>      fortunate captives, the Vandals, the Moors, and the Goths,</a>
<a id='line_2524'>      emulated the attachment of his domestic followers. By the union</a>
<a id='line_2525'>      of liberality and justice, he acquired the love of the soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      without alienating the affections of the people. The sick and</a>
<a id='line_2527'>      wounded were relieved with medicines and money; and still more</a>
<a id='line_2528'>      efficaciously, by the healing visits and smiles of their</a>
<a id='line_2529'>      commander. The loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly</a>
<a id='line_2530'>      repaired, and each deed of valor was rewarded by the rich and</a>
<a id='line_2531'>      honorable gifts of a bracelet or a collar, which were rendered</a>
<a id='line_2532'>      more precious by the judgment of Belisarius. He was endeared to</a>
<a id='line_2533'>      the husbandmen by the peace and plenty which they enjoyed under</a>
<a id='line_2534'>      the shadow of his standard. Instead of being injured, the country</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      was enriched by the march of the Roman armies; and such was the</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      rigid discipline of their camp, that not an apple was gathered</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      from the tree, not a path could be traced in the fields of corn.</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      Belisarius was chaste and sober. In the license of a military</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      life, none could boast that they had seen him intoxicated with</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      wine: the most beautiful captives of Gothic or Vandal race were</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      offered to his embraces; but he turned aside from their charms,</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      and the husband of Antonina was never suspected of violating the</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      laws of conjugal fidelity. The spectator and historian of his</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      exploits has observed, that amidst the perils of war, he was</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      daring without rashness, prudent without fear, slow or rapid</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      according to the exigencies of the moment; that in the deepest</a>
<a id='line_2547'>      distress he was animated by real or apparent hope, but that he</a>
<a id='line_2548'>      was modest and humble in the most prosperous fortune. By these</a>
<a id='line_2549'>      virtues, he equalled or excelled the ancient masters of the</a>
<a id='line_2550'>      military art. Victory, by sea and land, attended his arms. He</a>
<a id='line_2551'>      subdued Africa, Italy, and the adjacent islands; led away</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      captives the successors of Genseric and Theodoric; filled</a>
<a id='line_2553'>      Constantinople with the spoils of their palaces; and in the space</a>
<a id='line_2554'>      of six years recovered half the provinces of the Western empire.</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      In his fame and merit, in wealth and power, he remained without a</a>
<a id='line_2556'>      rival, the first of the Roman subjects; the voice of envy could</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      only magnify his dangerous importance; and the emperor might</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      applaud his own discerning spirit, which had discovered and</a>

<a id='line_2579'>      reluctantly confess, that the fame, and even the virtue, of</a>
<a id='line_2580'>      Belisarius, were polluted by the lust and cruelty of his wife;</a>
<a id='line_2581'>      and that hero deserved an appellation which may not drop from the</a>
<a id='line_2582'>      pen of the decent historian. The mother of Antonina 112 was a</a>
<a id='line_2583'>      theatrical prostitute, and both her father and grandfather</a>
<a id='line_2584'>      exercised, at Thessalonica and Constantinople, the vile, though</a>
<a id='line_2585'>      lucrative, profession of charioteers. In the various situations</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      of their fortune she became the companion, the enemy, the</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      servant, and the favorite of the empress Theodora: these loose</a>
<a id='line_2588'>      and ambitious females had been connected by similar pleasures;</a>
<a id='line_2589'>      they were separated by the jealousy of vice, and at length</a>
<a id='line_2590'>      reconciled by the partnership of guilt. Before her marriage with</a>
<a id='line_2591'>      Belisarius, Antonina had one husband and many lovers: Photius,</a>
<a id='line_2592'>      the son of her former nuptials, was of an age to distinguish</a>
<a id='line_2593'>      himself at the siege of Naples; and it was not till the autumn of</a>
<a id='line_2594'>      her age and beauty 113 that she indulged a scandalous attachment</a>
<a id='line_2595'>      to a Thracian youth. Theodosius had been educated in the Eunomian</a>
<a id='line_2596'>      heresy; the African voyage was consecrated by the baptism and</a>
<a id='line_2597'>      auspicious name of the first soldier who embarked; and the</a>
<a id='line_2598'>      proselyte was adopted into the family of his spiritual parents,</a>
<a id='line_2599'>      114 Belisarius and Antonina. Before they touched the shores of</a>
<a id='line_2600'>      Africa, this holy kindred degenerated into sensual love: and as</a>
<a id='line_2601'>      Antonina soon overleaped the bounds of modesty and caution, the</a>
<a id='line_2602'>      Roman general was alone ignorant of his own dishonor. During</a>
<a id='line_2603'>      their residence at Carthage, he surprised the two lovers in a</a>
<a id='line_2604'>      subterraneous chamber, solitary, warm, and almost naked. Anger</a>
<a id='line_2605'>      flashed from his eyes. “With the help of this young man,” said</a>
<a id='line_2606'>      the unblushing Antonina, “I was secreting our most precious</a>
<a id='line_2607'>      effects from the knowledge of Justinian.” The youth resumed his</a>
<a id='line_2608'>      garments, and the pious husband consented to disbelieve the</a>
<a id='line_2609'>      evidence of his own senses. From this pleasing and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_2610'>      voluntary delusion, Belisarius was awakened at Syracuse, by the</a>
<a id='line_2611'>      officious information of Macedonia; and that female attendant,</a>
<a id='line_2612'>      after requiring an oath for her security, produced two</a>
<a id='line_2613'>      chamberlains, who, like herself, had often beheld the adulteries</a>
<a id='line_2614'>      of Antonina. A hasty flight into Asia saved Theodosius from the</a>
<a id='line_2615'>      justice of an injured husband, who had signified to one of his</a>
<a id='line_2616'>      guards the order of his death; but the tears of Antonina, and her</a>
<a id='line_2617'>      artful seductions, assured the credulous hero of her innocence:</a>
<a id='line_2618'>      and he stooped, against his faith and judgment, to abandon those</a>
<a id='line_2619'>      imprudent friends, who had presumed to accuse or doubt the</a>
<a id='line_2620'>      chastity of his wife. The revenge of a guilty woman is implacable</a>
<a id='line_2621'>      and bloody: the unfortunate Macedonia, with the two witnesses,</a>
<a id='line_2622'>      were secretly arrested by the minister of her cruelty; their</a>
<a id='line_2623'>      tongues were cut out, their bodies were hacked into small pieces,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>      and their remains were cast into the Sea of Syracuse. A rash</a>
<a id='line_2625'>      though judicious saying of Constantine, “I would sooner have</a>
<a id='line_2626'>      punished the adulteress than the boy,” was deeply remembered by</a>
<a id='line_2627'>      Antonina; and two years afterwards, when despair had armed that</a>
<a id='line_2628'>      officer against his general, her sanguinary advice decided and</a>
<a id='line_2629'>      hastened his execution. Even the indignation of Photius was not</a>
<a id='line_2630'>      forgiven by his mother; the exile of her son prepared the recall</a>
<a id='line_2631'>      of her lover; and Theodosius condescended to accept the pressing</a>
<a id='line_2632'>      and humble invitation of the conqueror of Italy. In the absolute</a>
<a id='line_2633'>      direction of his household, and in the important commissions of</a>
<a id='line_2634'>      peace and war, 115 the favorite youth most rapidly acquired a</a>
<a id='line_2635'>      fortune of four hundred thousand pounds sterling; and after their</a>
<a id='line_2636'>      return to Constantinople, the passion of Antonina, at least,</a>
<a id='line_2637'>      continued ardent and unabated. But fear, devotion, and lassitude</a>
<a id='line_2638'>      perhaps, inspired Theodosius with more serious thoughts. He</a>
<a id='line_2639'>      dreaded the busy scandal of the capital, and the indiscreet</a>
<a id='line_2640'>      fondness of the wife of Belisarius; escaped from her embraces,</a>
<a id='line_2641'>      and retiring to Ephesus, shaved his head, and took refuge in the</a>
<a id='line_2642'>      sanctuary of a monastic life. The despair of the new Ariadne</a>
<a id='line_2643'>      could scarcely have been excused by the death of her husband. She</a>
<a id='line_2644'>      wept, she tore her hair, she filled the palace with her cries;</a>
<a id='line_2645'>      “she had lost the dearest of friends, a tender, a faithful, a</a>
<a id='line_2646'>      laborious friend!” But her warm entreaties, fortified by the</a>
<a id='line_2647'>      prayers of Belisarius, were insufficient to draw the holy monk</a>
<a id='line_2648'>      from the solitude of Ephesus. It was not till the general moved</a>
<a id='line_2649'>      forward for the Persian war, that Theodosius could be tempted to</a>
<a id='line_2650'>      return to Constantinople; and the short interval before the</a>

<a id='line_2683'>      the camp beyond the Tigris. Enraged by his own wrongs, and by the</a>
<a id='line_2684'>      dishonor of his blood, he cast away in his turn the sentiments of</a>
<a id='line_2685'>      nature, and revealed to Belisarius the turpitude of a woman who</a>
<a id='line_2686'>      had violated all the duties of a mother and a wife. From the</a>
<a id='line_2687'>      surprise and indignation of the Roman general, his former</a>
<a id='line_2688'>      credulity appears to have been sincere: he embraced the knees of</a>
<a id='line_2689'>      the son of Antonina, adjured him to remember his obligations</a>
<a id='line_2690'>      rather than his birth, and confirmed at the altar their holy vows</a>
<a id='line_2691'>      of revenge and mutual defence. The dominion of Antonina was</a>
<a id='line_2692'>      impaired by absence; and when she met her husband, on his return</a>
<a id='line_2693'>      from the Persian confines, Belisarius, in his first and transient</a>
<a id='line_2694'>      emotions, confined her person, and threatened her life. Photius</a>
<a id='line_2695'>      was more resolved to punish, and less prompt to pardon: he flew</a>
<a id='line_2696'>      to Ephesus; extorted from a trusty eunuch of his mother the full</a>
<a id='line_2697'>      confession of her guilt; arrested Theodosius and his treasures in</a>
<a id='line_2698'>      the church of St. John the Apostle, and concealed his captives,</a>
<a id='line_2699'>      whose execution was only delayed, in a secure and sequestered</a>
<a id='line_2700'>      fortress of Cilicia. Such a daring outrage against public justice</a>
<a id='line_2701'>      could not pass with impunity; and the cause of Antonina was</a>
<a id='line_2702'>      espoused by the empress, whose favor she had deserved by the</a>
<a id='line_2703'>      recent services of the disgrace of a praefect, and the exile and</a>
<a id='line_2704'>      murder of a pope. At the end of the campaign, Belisarius was</a>
<a id='line_2705'>      recalled; he complied, as usual, with the Imperial mandate. His</a>
<a id='line_2706'>      mind was not prepared for rebellion: his obedience, however</a>
<a id='line_2707'>      adverse to the dictates of honor, was consonant to the wishes of</a>
<a id='line_2708'>      his heart; and when he embraced his wife, at the command, and</a>
<a id='line_2709'>      perhaps in the presence, of the empress, the tender husband was</a>
<a id='line_2710'>      disposed to forgive or to be forgiven. The bounty of Theodora</a>
<a id='line_2711'>      reserved for her companion a more precious favor. “I have found,”</a>
<a id='line_2712'>      she said, “my dearest patrician, a pearl of inestimable value; it</a>
<a id='line_2713'>      has not yet been viewed by any mortal eye; but the sight and the</a>
<a id='line_2714'>      possession of this jewel are destined for my friend.” 1161 As</a>
<a id='line_2715'>      soon as the curiosity and impatience of Antonina were kindled,</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      the door of a bed-chamber was thrown open, and she beheld her</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      lover, whom the diligence of the eunuchs had discovered in his</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      secret prison. Her silent wonder burst into passionate</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      exclamations of gratitude and joy, and she named Theodora her</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      queen, her benefactress, and her savior. The monk of Ephesus was</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      nourished in the palace with luxury and ambition; but instead of</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      assuming, as he was promised, the command of the Roman armies,</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      Theodosius expired in the first fatigues of an amorous interview.</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      1162 The grief of Antonina could only be assuaged by the</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      sufferings of her son. A youth of consular rank, and a sickly</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      constitution, was punished, without a trial, like a malefactor</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      and a slave: yet such was the constancy of his mind, that Photius</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      sustained the tortures of the scourge and the rack, 1163 without</a>
<a id='line_2729'>      violating the faith which he had sworn to Belisarius. After this</a>
<a id='line_2730'>      fruitless cruelty, the son of Antonina, while his mother feasted</a>
<a id='line_2731'>      with the empress, was buried in her subterraneous prisons, which</a>
<a id='line_2732'>      admitted not the distinction of night and day. He twice escaped</a>
<a id='line_2733'>      to the most venerable sanctuaries of Constantinople, the churches</a>
<a id='line_2734'>      of St. Sophia, and of the Virgin: but his tyrants were insensible</a>
<a id='line_2735'>      of religion as of pity; and the helpless youth, amidst the</a>
<a id='line_2736'>      clamors of the clergy and people, was twice dragged from the</a>
<a id='line_2737'>      altar to the dungeon. His third attempt was more successful. At</a>
<a id='line_2738'>      the end of three years, the prophet Zachariah, or some mortal</a>
<a id='line_2739'>      friend, indicated the means of an escape: he eluded the spies and</a>
<a id='line_2740'>      guards of the empress, reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      embraced the profession of a monk; and the abbot Photius was</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      employed, after the death of Justinian, to reconcile and regulate</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      the churches of Egypt. The son of Antonina suffered all that an</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      enemy can inflict: her patient husband imposed on himself the</a>
<a id='line_2745'>      more exquisite misery of violating his promise and deserting his</a>
<a id='line_2746'>      friend.</a>

<a id='line_2767'>      In the succeeding campaign, Belisarius was again sent against the</a>
<a id='line_2768'>      Persians: he saved the East, but he offended Theodora, and</a>
<a id='line_2769'>      perhaps the emperor himself. The malady of Justinian had</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      countenanced the rumor of his death; and the Roman general, on</a>
<a id='line_2771'>      the supposition of that probable event spoke the free language of</a>
<a id='line_2772'>      a citizen and a soldier. His colleague Buzes, who concurred in</a>
<a id='line_2773'>      the same sentiments, lost his rank, his liberty, and his health,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      by the persecution of the empress: but the disgrace of Belisarius</a>
<a id='line_2775'>      was alleviated by the dignity of his own character, and the</a>
<a id='line_2776'>      influence of his wife, who might wish to humble, but could not</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      desire to ruin, the partner of her fortunes. Even his removal was</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      colored by the assurance, that the sinking state of Italy would</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      be retrieved by the single presence of its conqueror.</a>
<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>      But no sooner had he returned, alone and defenceless, than a</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      hostile commission was sent to the East, to seize his treasures</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      and criminate his actions; the guards and veterans, who followed</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      his private banner, were distributed among the chiefs of the</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      army, and even the eunuchs presumed to cast lots for the</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      partition of his martial domestics. When he passed with a small</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      and sordid retinue through the streets of Constantinople, his</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      forlorn appearance excited the amazement and compassion of the</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      people. Justinian and Theodora received him with cold</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      ingratitude; the servile crowd, with insolence and contempt; and</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      in the evening he retired with trembling steps to his deserted</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      palace. An indisposition, feigned or real, had confined Antonina</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      to her apartment; and she walked disdainfully silent in the</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      adjacent portico, while Belisarius threw himself on his bed, and</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      expected, in an agony of grief and terror, the death which he had</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      so often braved under the walls of Rome. Long after sunset a</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      messenger was announced from the empress: he opened, with anxious</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      curiosity, the letter which contained the sentence of his fate.</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      “You cannot be ignorant how much you have deserved my</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      displeasure. I am not insensible of the services of Antonina. To</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      her merits and intercession I have granted your life, and permit</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      you to retain a part of your treasures, which might be justly</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      forfeited to the state. Let your gratitude, where it is due, be</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      displayed, not in words, but in your future behavior.” I know not</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      how to believe or to relate the transports with which the hero is</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      said to have received this ignominious pardon. He fell prostrate</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      before his wife, he kissed the feet of his savior, and he</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      devoutly promised to live the grateful and submissive slave of</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      Antonina. A fine of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      sterling was levied on the fortunes of Belisarius; and with the</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      office of count, or master of the royal stables, he accepted the</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      conduct of the Italian war. At his departure from Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_2813'>      his friends, and even the public, were persuaded that as soon as</a>
<a id='line_2814'>      he regained his freedom, he would renounce his dissimulation, and</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      that his wife, Theodora, and perhaps the emperor himself, would</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      be sacrificed to the just revenge of a virtuous rebel. Their</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      hopes were deceived; and the unconquerable patience and loyalty</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      of Belisarius appear either below or above the character of a</a>
