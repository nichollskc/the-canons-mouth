                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according</a>
<a id='line_4'>to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which</a>
<a id='line_5'>is after godliness; 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that</a>
<a id='line_6'>cannot lie, promised before the world began; 1:3 But hath in due times</a>
<a id='line_7'>manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me</a>
<a id='line_8'>according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 1:4 To Titus, mine</a>
<a id='line_9'>own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the</a>
<a id='line_10'>Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in</a>
<a id='line_13'>order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as</a>
<a id='line_14'>I had appointed thee: 1:6 If any be blameless, the husband of one</a>
<a id='line_15'>wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not</a>
<a id='line_18'>selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given</a>
<a id='line_19'>to filthy lucre; 1:8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men,</a>
<a id='line_20'>sober, just, holy, temperate; 1:9 Holding fast the faithful word as he</a>
<a id='line_21'>hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort</a>
<a id='line_22'>and to convince the gainsayers.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,</a>
<a id='line_25'>specially they of the circumcision: 1:11 Whose mouths must be stopped,</a>
<a id='line_26'>who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for</a>
<a id='line_27'>filthy lucre’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The</a>
<a id='line_30'>Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they</a>
<a id='line_33'>may be sound in the faith; 1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and</a>
<a id='line_34'>commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled</a>
<a id='line_37'>and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is</a>
<a id='line_38'>defiled.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,</a>
<a id='line_41'>being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>2:1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 2:2 That</a>
<a id='line_44'>the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity,</a>
<a id='line_45'>in patience.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh</a>
<a id='line_48'>holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good</a>
<a id='line_49'>things; 2:4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love</a>
<a id='line_50'>their husbands, to love their children, 2:5 To be discreet, chaste,</a>
<a id='line_51'>keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word</a>
<a id='line_52'>of God be not blasphemed.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>2:6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>2:7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine</a>
<a id='line_57'>shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, 2:8 Sound speech, that</a>
<a id='line_58'>cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be</a>
<a id='line_59'>ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>2:9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to</a>
<a id='line_62'>please them well in all things; not answering again; 2:10 Not</a>
<a id='line_63'>purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the</a>
<a id='line_64'>doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all</a>
<a id='line_67'>men, 2:12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we</a>
<a id='line_68'>should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</a>
<a id='line_69'>2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the</a>
<a id='line_70'>great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 2:14 Who gave himself for us,</a>
<a id='line_71'>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a</a>
<a id='line_72'>peculiar people, zealous of good works.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>2:15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.</a>
<a id='line_75'>Let no man despise thee.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>3:1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to</a>
<a id='line_78'>obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 3:2 To speak evil of</a>
<a id='line_79'>no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all</a>
<a id='line_80'>men.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>3:3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,</a>
<a id='line_83'>deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and</a>
<a id='line_84'>envy, hateful, and hating one another.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>3:4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man</a>
<a id='line_87'>appeared, 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but</a>
<a id='line_88'>according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,</a>
<a id='line_89'>and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 3:6 Which he shed on us abundantly</a>
<a id='line_90'>through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 3:7 That being justified by his</a>
<a id='line_91'>grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>3:8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou</a>
<a id='line_94'>affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be</a>
<a id='line_95'>careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable</a>
<a id='line_96'>unto men.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>3:9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and</a>
<a id='line_99'>strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>3:10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition</a>
<a id='line_102'>reject; 3:11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth,</a>
<a id='line_103'>being condemned of himself.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>3:12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to</a>
<a id='line_106'>come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>3:13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently,</a>
<a id='line_109'>that nothing be wanting unto them.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>3:14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary</a>
<a id='line_112'>uses, that they be not unfruitful.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>3:15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the</a>
<a id='line_115'>faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</a>
