<a id='line_4'>INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>  O there is blessing in this gentle breeze,</a>
<a id='line_8'>  A visitant that while it fans my cheek</a>
<a id='line_9'>  Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings</a>
<a id='line_10'>  From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.</a>
<a id='line_11'>  Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come                       5</a>
<a id='line_12'>  To none more grateful than to me; escaped</a>
<a id='line_13'>  From the vast city, [A] where I long had pined</a>
<a id='line_14'>  A discontented sojourner: now free,</a>
<a id='line_15'>  Free as a bird to settle where I will.</a>
<a id='line_16'>  What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale                        10</a>
<a id='line_17'>  Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove</a>
<a id='line_18'>  Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream</a>
<a id='line_19'>  Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?</a>
<a id='line_20'>  The earth is all before me. [B] With a heart</a>
<a id='line_21'>  Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,                              15</a>
<a id='line_22'>  I look about; and should the chosen guide</a>
<a id='line_23'>  Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,</a>
<a id='line_24'>  I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!</a>
<a id='line_25'>  Trances of thought and mountings of the mind</a>
<a id='line_26'>  Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,                                20</a>
<a id='line_27'>  That burthen of my own unnatural self,</a>
<a id='line_28'>  The heavy weight of many a weary day [C]</a>
<a id='line_29'>  Not mine, and such as were not made for me.</a>
<a id='line_30'>  Long months of peace (if such bold word accord</a>
<a id='line_31'>  With any promises of human life),                                   25</a>
<a id='line_32'>  Long months of ease and undisturbed delight</a>
<a id='line_33'>  Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,</a>
<a id='line_34'>  By road or pathway, or through trackless field,</a>
<a id='line_35'>  Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing</a>
<a id='line_36'>  Upon the river point me out my course?                              30</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>    Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail</a>
<a id='line_39'>  But for a gift that consecrates the joy?</a>
<a id='line_40'>  For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven</a>
<a id='line_41'>  Was blowing on my body, felt within</a>
<a id='line_42'>  A correspondent breeze, that gently moved                           35</a>
<a id='line_43'>  With quickening virtue, but is now become</a>
<a id='line_44'>  A tempest, a redundant energy,</a>
<a id='line_45'>  Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,</a>
<a id='line_46'>  And their congenial powers, that, while they join</a>
<a id='line_47'>  In breaking up a long-continued frost,                              40</a>
<a id='line_48'>  Bring with them vernal promises, the hope</a>
<a id='line_49'>  Of active days urged on by flying hours,--</a>
<a id='line_50'>  Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought</a>
<a id='line_51'>  Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,</a>
<a id='line_52'>  Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!                             45</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>    Thus far, O Friend! [D] did I, not used to make</a>
<a id='line_55'>  A present joy the matter of a song,</a>
<a id='line_56'>  Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains</a>
<a id='line_57'>  That would not be forgotten, and are here</a>
<a id='line_58'>  Recorded: to the open fields I told                                 50</a>
<a id='line_59'>  A prophecy: poetic numbers came</a>
<a id='line_60'>  Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe</a>
<a id='line_61'>  A renovated spirit singled out,</a>
<a id='line_62'>  Such hope was mine, for holy services.</a>
<a id='line_63'>  My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's                  55</a>
<a id='line_64'>  Internal echo of the imperfect sound;</a>
<a id='line_65'>  To both I listened, drawing from them both</a>
<a id='line_66'>  A cheerful confidence in things to come.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>    Content and not unwilling now to give</a>
<a id='line_69'>  A respite to this passion, I paced on                               60</a>
<a id='line_70'>  With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,</a>
<a id='line_71'>  To a green shady place, [E] where down I sate</a>
<a id='line_72'>  Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice,</a>
<a id='line_73'>  And settling into gentler happiness.</a>
<a id='line_74'>  'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,                           65</a>
<a id='line_75'>  With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun</a>
<a id='line_76'>  Two hours declined towards the west; a day</a>
<a id='line_77'>  With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,</a>
<a id='line_78'>  And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove</a>
<a id='line_79'>  A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts                         70</a>
<a id='line_80'>  Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made</a>
<a id='line_81'>  Of a known Vale, [F] whither my feet should turn,</a>
<a id='line_82'>  Nor rest till they had reached the very door</a>
<a id='line_83'>  Of the one cottage [G] which methought I saw.</a>
<a id='line_84'>  No picture of mere memory ever looked                               75</a>
<a id='line_85'>  So fair; and while upon the fancied scene</a>
<a id='line_86'>  I gazed with growing love, a higher power</a>
<a id='line_87'>  Than Fancy gave assurance of some work</a>
<a id='line_88'>  Of glory there forthwith to be begun,</a>
<a id='line_89'>  Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,                     80</a>
<a id='line_90'>  Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,</a>
<a id='line_91'>  Save when, amid the stately groves of oaks,</a>
<a id='line_92'>  Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup</a>
<a id='line_93'>  Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once</a>
<a id='line_94'>  To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.                   85</a>
<a id='line_95'>  From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun</a>
<a id='line_96'>  Had almost touched the horizon; casting then</a>
<a id='line_97'>  A backward glance upon the curling cloud</a>
<a id='line_98'>  Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;</a>
<a id='line_99'>  Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,                                     90</a>
<a id='line_100'>  But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,</a>
<a id='line_101'>  Even with the chance equipment of that hour,</a>
<a id='line_102'>  The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale. [F]</a>
<a id='line_103'>  It was a splendid evening, and my soul</a>
<a id='line_104'>  Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked                    95</a>
<a id='line_105'>  Ã†olian visitations; but the harp</a>
<a id='line_106'>  Was soon defrauded, and the banded host</a>
<a id='line_107'>  Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,</a>
<a id='line_108'>  And lastly utter silence! "Be it so;</a>
<a id='line_109'>  Why think of any thing but present good?" [H]                      100</a>
<a id='line_110'>  So, like a home-bound labourer I pursued</a>
<a id='line_111'>  My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed</a>
<a id='line_112'>  Mild influence; nor left in me one wish</a>
<a id='line_113'>  Again to bend the Sabbath of that time</a>
<a id='line_114'>  To a servile yoke. What need of many words?                        105</a>
<a id='line_115'>  A pleasant loitering journey, through three days</a>
<a id='line_116'>  Continued, brought me to my hermitage, [I]</a>
<a id='line_117'>  I spare to tell of what ensued, the life</a>
<a id='line_118'>  In common things--the endless store of things,</a>
<a id='line_119'>  Rare, or at least so seeming, every day                            110</a>
<a id='line_120'>  Found all about me in one neighbourhood--</a>
<a id='line_121'>  The self-congratulation, and, from morn</a>
<a id='line_122'>  To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene. [K]</a>
<a id='line_123'>  But speedily an earnest longing rose</a>
<a id='line_124'>  To brace myself to some determined aim,                            115</a>
<a id='line_125'>  Reading or thinking; either to lay up</a>
<a id='line_126'>  New stores, or rescue from decay the old</a>
<a id='line_127'>  By timely interference: and therewith</a>
<a id='line_128'>  Came hopes still higher, that with outward life</a>
<a id='line_129'>  I might endue some airy phantasies                                 120</a>
<a id='line_130'>  That had been floating loose about for years,</a>
<a id='line_131'>  And to such beings temperately deal forth</a>
<a id='line_132'>  The many feelings that oppressed my heart.</a>
<a id='line_133'>  That hope hath been discouraged; welcome light</a>
<a id='line_134'>  Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear                        125</a>
<a id='line_135'>  And mock me with a sky that ripens not</a>
<a id='line_136'>  Into a steady morning: if my mind,</a>
<a id='line_137'>  Remembering the bold promise of the past,</a>
<a id='line_138'>  Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,</a>
<a id='line_139'>  Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds                     130</a>
<a id='line_140'>  Impediments from day to day renewed.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>    And now it would content me to yield up</a>
<a id='line_143'>  Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts</a>
<a id='line_144'>  Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!</a>
<a id='line_145'>  The Poet, gentle creature as he is,                                135</a>
<a id='line_146'>  Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times;</a>
<a id='line_147'>  His fits when he is neither sick nor well,</a>
<a id='line_148'>  Though no distress be near him but his own</a>
<a id='line_149'>  Unmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased</a>
<a id='line_150'>  While she as duteous as the mother dove                            140</a>
<a id='line_151'>  Sits brooding, lives not always to that end,</a>
<a id='line_152'>  But like the innocent bird, hath goadings on</a>
<a id='line_153'>  That drive her as in trouble through the groves; [L]</a>
<a id='line_154'>  With me is now such passion, to be blamed</a>
<a id='line_155'>  No otherwise than as it lasts too long.                            145</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>    When, as becomes a man who would prepare</a>
<a id='line_158'>  For such an arduous work, I through myself</a>
<a id='line_159'>  Make rigorous inquisition, the report</a>
<a id='line_160'>  Is often cheering; for I neither seem</a>
<a id='line_161'>  To lack that first great gift, the vital soul,                     150</a>
<a id='line_162'>  Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sort</a>
<a id='line_163'>  Of Elements and Agents, Under-powers,</a>
<a id='line_164'>  Subordinate helpers of the living mind:</a>
<a id='line_165'>  Nor am I naked of external things,</a>
<a id='line_166'>  Forms, images, nor numerous other aids                             155</a>
<a id='line_167'>  Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil</a>
<a id='line_168'>  And needful to build up a Poet's praise.</a>
<a id='line_169'>  Time, place, and manners do I seek, and these</a>
<a id='line_170'>  Are found in plenteous store, but nowhere such</a>
<a id='line_171'>  As may be singled out with steady choice;                          160</a>
<a id='line_172'>  No little band of yet remembered names</a>
<a id='line_173'>  Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope</a>
<a id='line_174'>  To summon back from lonesome banishment,</a>
<a id='line_175'>  And make them dwellers in the hearts of men</a>
<a id='line_176'>  Now living, or to live in future years.                            165</a>
<a id='line_177'>  Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking</a>
<a id='line_178'>  Proud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,</a>
<a id='line_179'>  Will settle on some British theme, some old</a>
<a id='line_180'>  Romantic tale by Milton left unsung;</a>
<a id='line_181'>  More often turning to some gentle place                            170</a>
<a id='line_182'>  Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipe</a>
<a id='line_183'>  To shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,</a>
<a id='line_184'>  Amid reposing knights by a river side</a>
<a id='line_185'>  Or fountain, listen to the grave reports</a>
<a id='line_186'>  Of dire enchantments faced and overcome                            175</a>
<a id='line_187'>  By the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,</a>
<a id='line_188'>  Where spear encountered spear, and sword with sword</a>
<a id='line_189'>  Fought, as if conscious of the blazonry</a>
<a id='line_190'>  That the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;</a>
<a id='line_191'>  Whence inspiration for a song that winds                           180</a>
<a id='line_192'>  Through ever changing scenes of votive quest</a>
<a id='line_193'>  Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid</a>
<a id='line_194'>  To patient courage and unblemished truth,</a>
<a id='line_195'>  To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,</a>
<a id='line_196'>  And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.                   185</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate</a>
<a id='line_198'>  How vanquished Mithridates northward passed,</a>
<a id='line_199'>  And, hidden in the cloud of years, became</a>
<a id='line_200'>  Odin, the Father of a race by whom</a>
<a id='line_201'>  Perished the Roman Empire: [M] how the friends                     190</a>
<a id='line_202'>  And followers of Sertorius, [N] out of Spain</a>
<a id='line_203'>  Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles, [O]</a>
<a id='line_204'>  And left their usages, their arts and laws,</a>
<a id='line_205'>  To disappear by a slow gradual death,</a>
<a id='line_206'>  To dwindle and to perish one by one,                               195</a>
<a id='line_207'>  Starved in those narrow bounds: [P] but not the soul</a>
<a id='line_208'>  Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years</a>
<a id='line_209'>  Survived, and, when the European came</a>
<a id='line_210'>  With skill and power that might not be withstood,</a>
<a id='line_211'>  Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold                          200</a>
<a id='line_212'>  And wasted down by glorious death that race</a>
<a id='line_213'>  Of natural heroes: or I would record</a>
<a id='line_214'>  How, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,</a>
<a id='line_215'>  Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,</a>
<a id='line_216'>  Suffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,                     205</a>
<a id='line_217'>  How that one Frenchman, [Q] through continued force</a>
<a id='line_218'>  Of meditation on the inhuman deeds</a>
<a id='line_219'>  Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles,</a>
<a id='line_220'>  Went single in his ministry across</a>
<a id='line_221'>  The Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,                           210</a>
<a id='line_222'>  But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about</a>
<a id='line_223'>  Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought</a>
<a id='line_224'>  Help at his need in Dalecarlia's mines: [R]</a>
<a id='line_225'>  How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name</a>
<a id='line_226'>  Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,                        215</a>
<a id='line_227'>  All over his dear Country; [S] left the deeds</a>
<a id='line_228'>  Of Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,</a>
<a id='line_229'>  To people the steep rocks and river banks,</a>
<a id='line_230'>  Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul</a>
<a id='line_231'>  Of independence and stern liberty.                                 220</a>
<a id='line_232'>  Sometimes it suits me better to invent</a>
<a id='line_233'>  A tale from my own heart, more near akin</a>
<a id='line_234'>  To my own passions and habitual thoughts;</a>
<a id='line_235'>  Some variegated story, in the main</a>
<a id='line_236'>  Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts                       225</a>
<a id='line_237'>  Before the very sun that brightens it,</a>
<a id='line_238'>  Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,</a>
<a id='line_239'>  My best and favourite aspiration, mounts</a>
<a id='line_240'>  With yearning toward some philosophic song</a>
<a id='line_241'>  Of Truth that cherishes our daily life;                            230</a>
<a id='line_242'>  With meditations passionate from deep</a>
<a id='line_243'>  Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse [T]</a>
<a id='line_244'>  Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre; [U]</a>
<a id='line_245'>  But from this awful burthen I full soon</a>
<a id='line_246'>  Take refuge and beguile myself with trust                          235</a>
<a id='line_247'>  That mellower years will bring a riper mind</a>
<a id='line_248'>  And clearer insight. Thus my days are past</a>
<a id='line_249'>  In contradiction; with no skill to part</a>
<a id='line_250'>  Vague longing, haply bred by want of power,</a>
<a id='line_251'>  From paramount impulse not to be withstood,                        240</a>
<a id='line_252'>  A timorous capacity from prudence,</a>
<a id='line_253'>  From circumspection, infinite delay.</a>
<a id='line_254'>  Humility and modest awe themselves</a>
<a id='line_255'>  Betray me, serving often for a cloak</a>
<a id='line_256'>  To a more subtle selfishness; that now                             245</a>
<a id='line_257'>  Locks every function up in blank reserve,</a>
<a id='line_258'>  Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye</a>
<a id='line_259'>  That with intrusive restlessness beats off</a>
<a id='line_260'>  Simplicity and self-presented truth.</a>
<a id='line_261'>  Ah! better far than this, to stray about                           250</a>
<a id='line_262'>  Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,</a>
<a id='line_263'>  And ask no record of the hours, resigned</a>
<a id='line_264'>  To vacant musing, unreproved neglect</a>
<a id='line_265'>  Of all things, and deliberate holiday.</a>
<a id='line_266'>  Far better never to have heard the name                            255</a>
<a id='line_267'>  Of zeal and just ambition, than to live</a>
<a id='line_268'>  Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour</a>

<a id='line_272'>  This is my lot; for either still I find</a>
<a id='line_273'>  Some imperfection in the chosen theme,</a>

<a id='line_277'>  In listlessness from vain perplexity,</a>
<a id='line_278'>  Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,</a>

<a id='line_281'>                             Was it for this</a>
<a id='line_282'>  That one, the fairest of all rivers, [V] loved                     270</a>
<a id='line_283'>  To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,</a>
<a id='line_284'>  And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,</a>

<a id='line_286'>  That flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,</a>
<a id='line_287'>  O Derwent! winding among grassy holms                              275</a>
<a id='line_288'>  Where I was looking on, a babe in arms,</a>
<a id='line_289'>  Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_290'>  To more than infant softness, giving me</a>
<a id='line_291'>  Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind</a>
<a id='line_292'>  A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm                            280</a>
<a id='line_293'>  That Nature breathes among the hills and groves?</a>
<a id='line_294'>  When he had left the mountains and received</a>

<a id='line_297'>  Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed                       285</a>
<a id='line_298'>  Along the margin of our terrace walk; [X]</a>
<a id='line_299'>  A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.</a>
<a id='line_300'>  Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,</a>
<a id='line_301'>  In a small mill-race severed from his stream,</a>
<a id='line_302'>  Made one long bathing of a summer's day;                           290</a>
<a id='line_303'>  Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again</a>
<a id='line_304'>  Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured</a>
<a id='line_305'>  The sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves</a>
<a id='line_306'>  Of yellow ragwort; or when rock and hill,</a>
<a id='line_307'>  The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,                     295</a>
<a id='line_308'>  Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone</a>
<a id='line_309'>  Beneath the sky, as if I had been born</a>
<a id='line_310'>  On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut</a>
<a id='line_311'>  Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport</a>
<a id='line_312'>  A naked savage, in the thunder shower.                             300</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>    Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up</a>
<a id='line_315'>  Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:</a>
<a id='line_316'>  Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less</a>
<a id='line_317'>  In that beloved Vale to which erelong</a>
<a id='line_318'>  We were transplanted [Y]--there were we let loose                  305</a>
<a id='line_319'>  For sports of wider range. Ere I had told</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Ten birth-days, [Z] when among the mountain slopes</a>
<a id='line_321'>  Frost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped</a>
<a id='line_322'>  The last autumnal crocus, [a] 'twas my joy</a>
<a id='line_323'>  With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung                       310</a>
<a id='line_324'>  To range the open heights where woodcocks run</a>
<a id='line_325'>  Along the smooth green turf. [b] Through half the night,</a>
<a id='line_326'>  Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied</a>
<a id='line_327'>  That anxious visitation;--moon and stars</a>
<a id='line_328'>  Were shining o'er my head. I was alone,                            315</a>
<a id='line_329'>  And seemed to be a trouble to the peace</a>
<a id='line_330'>  That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befel</a>
<a id='line_331'>  In these night wanderings, that a strong desire</a>
<a id='line_332'>  O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird</a>
<a id='line_333'>  Which was the captive of another's toil                            320</a>
<a id='line_334'>  Became my prey; and when the deed was done</a>
<a id='line_335'>  I heard among the solitary hills</a>
<a id='line_336'>  Low breathings coming after me, and sounds</a>
<a id='line_337'>  Of undistinguishable motion, steps</a>
<a id='line_338'>  Almost as silent as the turf they trod.                            325</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>  Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale, [c]</a>
<a id='line_341'>  Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird</a>
<a id='line_342'>  Had in high places built her lodge; though mean</a>
<a id='line_343'>  Our object and inglorious, yet the end</a>
<a id='line_344'>  Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung                              330</a>
<a id='line_345'>  Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass</a>
<a id='line_346'>  And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock</a>
<a id='line_347'>  But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)</a>
<a id='line_348'>  Suspended by the blast that blew amain,</a>
<a id='line_349'>  Shouldering the naked crag, [d] oh, at that time                    335</a>
<a id='line_350'>  While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,</a>
<a id='line_351'>  With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind</a>
<a id='line_352'>  Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky</a>
<a id='line_353'>  Of earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>    Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows                         340</a>
<a id='line_356'>  Like harmony in music; there is a dark</a>
<a id='line_357'>  Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles</a>
<a id='line_358'>  Discordant elements, makes them cling together</a>
<a id='line_359'>  In one society. How strange that all</a>
<a id='line_360'>  The terrors, pains, and early miseries,                             345</a>
<a id='line_361'>  Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused</a>
<a id='line_362'>  Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,</a>
<a id='line_363'>  And that a needful part, in making up</a>
<a id='line_364'>  The calm existence that is mine when I</a>
<a id='line_365'>  Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!                             350</a>
<a id='line_366'>  Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;</a>
<a id='line_367'>  Whether her fearless visitings, or those</a>
<a id='line_368'>  That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light</a>
<a id='line_369'>  Opening the peaceful clouds; or she may use</a>
<a id='line_370'>  Severer interventions, ministry                                     355</a>
<a id='line_371'>  More palpable, as best might suit her aim.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>    One summer evening (led by her) I found</a>
<a id='line_374'>  A little boat tied to a willow tree</a>
<a id='line_375'>  Within a rocky cave, [e] its usual home.</a>
<a id='line_376'>  Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in                      360</a>
<a id='line_377'>  Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth</a>
<a id='line_378'>  And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice</a>
<a id='line_379'>  Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;</a>
<a id='line_380'>  Leaving behind her still, on either side,</a>
<a id='line_381'>  Small circles glittering idly in the moon,                          365</a>
<a id='line_382'>  Until they melted all into one track</a>
<a id='line_383'>  Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,</a>
<a id='line_384'>  Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point</a>
<a id='line_385'>  With an unswerving line, I fixed my view</a>
<a id='line_386'>  Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,                                  370</a>
<a id='line_387'>  The horizon's utmost boundary; far above</a>
<a id='line_388'>  Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.</a>
<a id='line_389'>  She was an elfin pinnace; lustily</a>
<a id='line_390'>  I dipped my oars into the silent lake,</a>
<a id='line_391'>  And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat                             375</a>
<a id='line_392'>  Went heaving through the water like a swan;</a>
<a id='line_393'>  When, from behind that craggy steep till then</a>
<a id='line_394'>  The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,</a>
<a id='line_395'>  As if with voluntary power instinct</a>
<a id='line_396'>  Upreared its head. [f] I struck and struck again,                   380</a>
<a id='line_397'>  And growing still in stature the grim shape</a>
<a id='line_398'>  Towered up between me and the stars, and still,</a>
<a id='line_399'>  For so it seemed, with purpose of its own</a>
<a id='line_400'>  And measured motion like a living thing,</a>
<a id='line_401'>  Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,                      385</a>
<a id='line_402'>  And through the silent water stole my way</a>
<a id='line_403'>  Back to the covert of the willow tree;</a>
<a id='line_404'>  There in her mooring-place I left my bark,--</a>
<a id='line_405'>  And through the meadows homeward went, in grave</a>
<a id='line_406'>  And serious mood; but after I had seen                              390</a>
<a id='line_407'>  That spectacle, for many days, my brain</a>
<a id='line_408'>  Worked with a dim and undetermined sense</a>
<a id='line_409'>  Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_410'>  There hung a darkness, call it solitude</a>
<a id='line_411'>  Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes                              395</a>
<a id='line_412'>  Remained, no pleasant images of trees,</a>
<a id='line_413'>  Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;</a>
<a id='line_414'>  But huge and mighty forms, that do not live</a>
<a id='line_415'>  Like living men, moved slowly through the mind</a>
<a id='line_416'>  By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.                            400</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>    Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!</a>
<a id='line_419'>  Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought,</a>
<a id='line_420'>  That givest to forms and images a breath</a>
<a id='line_421'>  And everlasting motion, not in vain</a>
<a id='line_422'>  By day or star-light thus from my first dawn                        405</a>
<a id='line_423'>  Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me</a>
<a id='line_424'>  The passions that build up our human soul;</a>
<a id='line_425'>  Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,</a>
<a id='line_426'>  But with high objects, with enduring things--</a>
<a id='line_427'>  With life and nature, purifying thus                                410</a>
<a id='line_428'>  The elements of feeling and of thought,</a>
<a id='line_429'>  And sanctifying, by such discipline,</a>
<a id='line_430'>  Both pain and fear, until we recognise</a>
<a id='line_431'>  A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.</a>
<a id='line_432'>  Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me                            415</a>
<a id='line_433'>  With stinted kindness. In November days,</a>
<a id='line_434'>  When vapours rolling down the valley made</a>
<a id='line_435'>  A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods</a>
<a id='line_436'>  At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,</a>
<a id='line_437'>  When, by the margin of the trembling lake,                          420</a>
<a id='line_438'>  Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went</a>
<a id='line_439'>  In solitude, such intercourse was mine;</a>
<a id='line_440'>  Mine was it in the fields both day and night,</a>
<a id='line_441'>  And by the waters, all the summer long.</a>
<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>    And in the frosty season, when the sun                            425</a>
<a id='line_444'>  Was set, and visible for many a mile</a>
<a id='line_445'>  The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,</a>
<a id='line_446'>  I heeded not their summons: happy time</a>
<a id='line_447'>  It was indeed for all of us--for me</a>
<a id='line_448'>  It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud                            430</a>
<a id='line_449'>  The village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,</a>
<a id='line_450'>  Proud and exulting like an untired horse</a>
<a id='line_451'>  That cares not for his home. All shod with steel,</a>
<a id='line_452'>  We hissed along the polished ice in games</a>
<a id='line_453'>  Confederate, imitative of the chase                                 435</a>
<a id='line_454'>  And woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,</a>
<a id='line_455'>  The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.</a>
<a id='line_456'>  So through the darkness and the cold we flew,</a>
<a id='line_457'>  And not a voice was idle; with the din</a>
<a id='line_458'>  Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;                                 440</a>
<a id='line_459'>  The leafless trees and every icy crag</a>
<a id='line_460'>  Tinkled like iron; [g] while far distant hills</a>
<a id='line_461'>  Into the tumult sent an alien sound</a>
<a id='line_462'>  Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars</a>
<a id='line_463'>  Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west                      445</a>
<a id='line_464'>  The orange sky of evening died away.</a>
<a id='line_465'>  Not seldom from the uproar I retired</a>
<a id='line_466'>  Into a silent bay, or sportively</a>
<a id='line_467'>  Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,</a>
<a id='line_468'>  To cut across the reflex of a star                                  450</a>
<a id='line_469'>  That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed</a>
<a id='line_470'>  Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,</a>
<a id='line_471'>  When we had given our bodies to the wind,</a>
<a id='line_472'>  And all the shadowy banks on either side</a>
<a id='line_473'>  Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still                  455</a>
<a id='line_474'>  The rapid line of motion, then at once</a>
<a id='line_475'>  Have I, reclining back upon my heels,</a>
<a id='line_476'>  Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs</a>
<a id='line_477'>  Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled</a>
<a id='line_478'>  With visible motion her diurnal round!                              460</a>
<a id='line_479'>  Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,</a>
<a id='line_480'>  Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched</a>
<a id='line_481'>  Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep. [h]</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>    Ye Presences of Nature in the sky</a>

<a id='line_485'>  And Souls of lonely places! can I think</a>
<a id='line_486'>  A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed</a>
<a id='line_487'>  Such ministry, when ye through many a year</a>

<a id='line_489'>  On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,                       470</a>
<a id='line_490'>  Impressed upon all forms the characters</a>
<a id='line_491'>  Of danger or desire; and thus did make</a>
<a id='line_492'>  The surface of the universal earth</a>
<a id='line_493'>  With triumph and delight, with hope and fear,</a>
<a id='line_494'>  Work like a sea?</a>
<a id='line_495'>    Not uselessly employed,                                           475</a>
<a id='line_496'>  Might I pursue this theme through every change</a>
<a id='line_497'>  Of exercise and play, to which the year</a>
<a id='line_498'>  Did summon us in his delightful round.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>    We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven</a>
<a id='line_501'>  Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours;                          480</a>
<a id='line_502'>  Nor saw a band in happiness and joy</a>
<a id='line_503'>  Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.</a>
<a id='line_504'>  I could record with no reluctant voice</a>
<a id='line_505'>  The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers</a>
<a id='line_506'>  With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,                    485</a>
<a id='line_507'>  True symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong</a>
<a id='line_508'>  And unreproved enchantment led us on</a>
<a id='line_509'>  By rocks and pools shut out from every star,</a>

<a id='line_511'>  Among the windings hid of mountain brooks. [i]                      490</a>
<a id='line_512'>  --Unfading recollections! at this hour</a>

<a id='line_518'>  Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly</a>

<a id='line_603'>  Of shining water, gathering as it seemed</a>
<a id='line_604'>  Through every hair-breadth in that field of light</a>
<a id='line_605'>  New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.                          580</a>
<a id='line_606'></a>
<a id='line_607'>    Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy</a>
<a id='line_608'>  Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits</a>
<a id='line_609'>  Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss</a>
<a id='line_610'>  Which, like a tempest, works along the blood</a>

<a id='line_612'>  Gleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earth</a>
<a id='line_613'>  And common face of Nature spake to me</a>
<a id='line_614'>  Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,</a>
<a id='line_615'>  By chance collisions and quaint accidents</a>
<a id='line_616'>  (Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed                        590</a>
<a id='line_617'>  Of evil-minded fairies), yet not vain</a>
<a id='line_618'>  Nor profitless, if haply they impressed</a>
<a id='line_619'>  Collateral objects and appearances,</a>
<a id='line_620'>  Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep</a>
<a id='line_621'>  Until maturer seasons called them forth                             595</a>

<a id='line_623'>--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight</a>
<a id='line_624'>  Wearied itself out of the memory,</a>
<a id='line_625'>  The scenes which were a witness of that joy</a>
<a id='line_626'>  Remained in their substantial lineaments                            600</a>
<a id='line_627'>  Depicted on the brain, and to the eye</a>
<a id='line_628'>  Were visible, a daily sight; and thus</a>
<a id='line_629'>  By the impressive discipline of fear,</a>
<a id='line_630'>  By pleasure and repeated happiness,</a>

<a id='line_633'>  Of things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,</a>
<a id='line_634'>  So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,</a>
<a id='line_635'>  Though yet the day was distant, did become</a>
<a id='line_636'>  Habitually dear, and all their forms                                610</a>
<a id='line_637'>  And changeful colours by invisible links</a>

<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>                                   I began</a>

<a id='line_647'>  With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.</a>
<a id='line_648'>  Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch                     620</a>
<a id='line_649'>  Invigorating thoughts from former years;</a>
<a id='line_650'>  Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,</a>

<a id='line_671'>  I choose it rather at this time, than work</a>

<a id='line_682'>[Footnote A: On the authority of the poet's nephew, and others, the</a>
<a id='line_683'>"city" here referred to has invariably been supposed to be Goslar, where</a>
<a id='line_684'>he spent the winter of 1799. Goslar, however, is as unlike a "vast city"</a>
<a id='line_685'>as it is possible to conceive. Wordsworth could have walked from end to</a>
<a id='line_686'>end of it in ten minutes.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>One would think he was rather referring to London, but there is no</a>
<a id='line_689'>evidence to show that he visited the metropolis in the spring of 1799.</a>
<a id='line_690'>The lines which follow about "the open fields" (l. 50) are certainly</a>
<a id='line_691'>more appropriate to a journey from London to Sockburn, than from Goslar</a>
<a id='line_692'>to Gottingen; and what follows, the "green shady place" of l. 62, the</a>

<a id='line_861'>[Footnote d: As there are no "naked crags" with "half-inch fissures in</a>

<a id='line_881'></a>
<a id='line_882'>[Footnote f: The "craggy steep till then the horizon's bound," is</a>

<a id='line_888'>beyond the craggy ridge of Loughrigg the mass of Nab-Scar, and Rydal</a>

<a id='line_919'>[Footnote k: The pupils in the Hawkshead school, in Wordsworth's time,</a>
<a id='line_920'>boarded in the houses of village dames. Wordsworth lived with one Anne</a>
<a id='line_921'>Tyson, for whom he ever afterwards cherished the warmest regard, and</a>
<a id='line_922'>whose simple character he has immortalised. (See especially in the</a>
<a id='line_923'>fourth book of 'The Prelude', p. 187, etc.) Wordsworth lived in her</a>
<a id='line_924'>cottage at Hawkshead during nine eventful years. It still remains</a>
<a id='line_925'>externally unaltered, and little, if at all, changed in the interior. It</a>
<a id='line_926'>may be reached through a picturesque archway, near the principal inn of</a>
<a id='line_927'>the village (The Lion); and is on the right of a small open yard, which</a>
<a id='line_928'>is entered through this archway. To the left, a lane leads westwards to</a>
<a id='line_929'>the open country. It is a humble dwelling of two storeys. The floor of</a>
<a id='line_930'>the basement flat-paved with the blue flags of Coniston slate--is not</a>
<a id='line_931'>likely to have been changed since Wordsworth's time. The present door</a>
<a id='line_932'>with its "latch" (see book ii. l. 339), is probably the same as that</a>
<a id='line_933'>referred to in the poem, as in use in 1776, and onwards. For further</a>

<a id='line_1032'>  Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  The simple ways in which my childhood walked;</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  Those chiefly that first led me to the love</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet                        5</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  Was in its birth, sustained as might befal</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  By nourishment that came unsought; for still</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  From week to week, from month to month, we lived</a>
<a id='line_1039'>  A round of tumult. Duly were our games</a>
<a id='line_1040'>  Prolonged in summer till the day-light failed:                      10</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  No chair remained before the doors; the bench</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  The labourer, and the old man who had sate</a>
<a id='line_1044'>  A later lingerer; yet the revelry</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  Continued and the loud uproar: at last,                             15</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  Ah! is there one who ever has been young,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride                         20</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  One is there, though the wisest and the best</a>

<a id='line_1054'>  Union that cannot be;--who would not give,</a>

<a id='line_1056'>  The eagerness of infantine desire?</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  A tranquillising spirit presses now</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  On my corporeal frame, so wide appears</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  The vacancy between me and those days</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,                       30</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  That, musing on them, often do I seem</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  And of some other Being. A rude mass</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  Of native rock, left midway in the square</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  Of our small market village, was the goal                           35</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  Or centre of these sports; [A] and when, returned</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  After long absence, thither I repaired,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,                    40</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  That more than one of you will think with me</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  From whom the stone was named, who there had sate,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>  And watched her table with its huckster's wares                     45</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  Assiduous, through the length of sixty years.</a>
<a id='line_1077'></a>
<a id='line_1078'>    We ran a boisterous course; the year span round</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  With giddy motion. But the time approached</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  That brought with it a regular desire</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms                        50</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  Of Nature were collaterally attached</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  To every scheme of holiday delight</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  And every boyish sport, less grateful else</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  And languidly pursued.</a>
<a id='line_1086'>                         When summer came,</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,                           55</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  To sweep, along the plain of Windermere</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  With rival oars; [B] and the selected bourne</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  Was now an Island musical with birds</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown                           60</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  With lilies of the valley like a field; [C]</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  And now a third small Island, where survived</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  In solitude the ruins of a shrine</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  Daily with chaunted rites. [D] In such a race                       65</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  So ended, disappointment could be none,</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  And the vain-glory of superior skill,                               70</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  Were tempered; thus was gradually produced</a>
<a id='line_1104'>  A quiet independence of the heart;</a>
<a id='line_1105'>  And to my Friend who knows me I may add,</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  Fearless of blame, that hence for future days</a>
<a id='line_1107'>  Ensued a diffidence and modesty,                                    75</a>
<a id='line_1108'>  And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,</a>
<a id='line_1109'>  The self-sufficing power of Solitude.</a>
<a id='line_1110'></a>
<a id='line_1111'>    Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  More than we wished we knew the blessing then</a>
<a id='line_1113'>  Of vigorous hunger--hence corporeal strength                        80</a>
<a id='line_1114'>  Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude</a>
<a id='line_1115'>  A little weekly stipend, and we lived</a>
<a id='line_1116'>  Through three divisions of the quartered year</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  In penniless poverty. But now to school</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  From the half-yearly holidays returned,                             85</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  We came with weightier purses, that sufficed</a>
<a id='line_1120'>  To furnish treats more costly than the Dame</a>
<a id='line_1121'>  Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  Or in the woods, or by a river side                                 90</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  Or shady fountains, while among the leaves</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.</a>
<a id='line_1127'>  Nor is my aim neglected if I tell</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  How sometimes, in the length of those half-years,                   95</a>
<a id='line_1129'>  We from our funds drew largely;--proud to curb,</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;</a>
<a id='line_1131'>  And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud</a>
<a id='line_1132'>  Supplied our want, we haply might employ</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound                           100</a>

<a id='line_1143'>  From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers                          110</a>

<a id='line_1148'></a>
<a id='line_1149'>    Our steeds remounted and the summons given,                      115</a>

<a id='line_1151'>  In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  And the stone-abbot, [H] and that single wren</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  Of the old church, that--though from recent showers                120</a>
<a id='line_1155'>  The earth was comfortless, and touched by faint</a>

<a id='line_1157'>  And respirations, from the roofless walls</a>
<a id='line_1158'>  The shuddering ivy dripped large drops--yet still</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird                       125</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  Sang to herself, that there I could have made</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  To hear such music. Through the walls we flew</a>
<a id='line_1163'>  And down the valley, and, a circuit made</a>
<a id='line_1164'>  In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth                   130</a>
<a id='line_1165'>  We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  And that still spirit shed from evening air!</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt</a>
<a id='line_1168'>  Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed</a>
<a id='line_1169'>  Along the sides of the steep hills, or when                        135</a>
<a id='line_1170'>  Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea</a>
<a id='line_1171'>  We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>    Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  Within the crescent of a pleasant bay, [I]</a>
<a id='line_1175'>  A tavern stood; [K] no homely-featured house,                      140</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.</a>
<a id='line_1180'>  In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built                       145</a>
<a id='line_1181'>  On the large island, had this dwelling been</a>

<a id='line_1186'>  Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged</a>
<a id='line_1187'>  The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight</a>

<a id='line_1189'>  Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear</a>
<a id='line_1190'>  With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay                          155</a>
<a id='line_1191'>  Upon a slope surmounted by a plain</a>
<a id='line_1192'>  Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood</a>
<a id='line_1193'>  A grove, with gleams of water through the trees</a>
<a id='line_1194'>  And over the tree-tops; [M] nor did we want</a>
<a id='line_1195'>  Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.                        160</a>
<a id='line_1196'>  There, while through half an afternoon we played</a>
<a id='line_1197'>  On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed</a>
<a id='line_1198'>  Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee</a>
<a id='line_1199'>  Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,</a>
<a id='line_1200'>  When in our pinnace we returned at leisure                         165</a>
<a id='line_1201'>  Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach</a>
<a id='line_1202'>  Of some small island steered our course with one,</a>
<a id='line_1203'>  The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there, [N]</a>
<a id='line_1204'>  And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute</a>
<a id='line_1205'>  Alone upon the rock--oh, then, the calm                            170</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  And dead still water lay upon my mind</a>
<a id='line_1207'>  Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,</a>
<a id='line_1208'>  Never before so beautiful, sank down</a>
<a id='line_1209'>  Into my heart, and held me like a dream!</a>
<a id='line_1210'>  Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus                         175</a>
<a id='line_1211'>  Daily the common range of visible things</a>
<a id='line_1212'>  Grew dear to me: already I began</a>

<a id='line_1220'>  The western mountain [P] touch his setting orb,                    185</a>
<a id='line_1221'>  In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess</a>
<a id='line_1222'>  Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow</a>
<a id='line_1223'>  For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.</a>
<a id='line_1224'>  And, from like feelings, humble though intense,</a>
<a id='line_1225'>  To patriotic and domestic love                                     190</a>

<a id='line_1248'>  Science appears but what in truth she is,</a>

<a id='line_1278'>  No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:</a>
<a id='line_1279'>  Along his infant veins are interfused</a>
<a id='line_1280'>  The gravitation and the filial bond</a>
<a id='line_1281'>  Of nature that connect him with the world.</a>
<a id='line_1282'>  Is there a flower, to which he points with hand                    245</a>
<a id='line_1283'>  Too weak to gather it, already love</a>
<a id='line_1284'>  Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him</a>
<a id='line_1285'>  Hath beautified that flower; already shades</a>
<a id='line_1286'>  Of pity cast from inward tenderness</a>
<a id='line_1287'>  Do fall around him upon aught that bears                           250</a>
<a id='line_1288'>  Unsightly marks of violence or harm.</a>
<a id='line_1289'>  Emphatically such a Being lives,</a>
<a id='line_1290'>  Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>  An inmate of this active universe.</a>
<a id='line_1292'>  For feeling has to him imparted power                              255</a>
<a id='line_1293'>  That through the growing faculties of sense</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  Doth like an agent of the one great Mind</a>

<a id='line_1298'>  Poetic spirit of our human life,</a>

<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>                         From early days,                            265</a>
<a id='line_1305'>  Beginning not long after that first time</a>
<a id='line_1306'>  In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch</a>
<a id='line_1307'>  I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>  I have endeavoured to display the means</a>
<a id='line_1309'>  Whereby this infant sensibility,                                   270</a>
<a id='line_1310'>  Great birthright of our being, was in me</a>
<a id='line_1311'>  Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path</a>
<a id='line_1312'>  More difficult before me; and I fear</a>
<a id='line_1313'>  That in its broken windings we shall need</a>
<a id='line_1314'>  The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:                         275</a>
<a id='line_1315'>  For now a trouble came into my mind</a>
<a id='line_1316'>  From unknown causes. I was left alone</a>
<a id='line_1317'>  Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.</a>
<a id='line_1318'>  The props of my affections were removed,</a>
<a id='line_1319'>  And yet the building stood, as if sustained                        280</a>
<a id='line_1320'>  By its own spirit! All that I beheld</a>
<a id='line_1321'>  Was dear, and hence to finer influxes</a>
<a id='line_1322'>  The mind lay open to a more exact</a>
<a id='line_1323'>  And close communion. Many are our joys</a>
<a id='line_1324'>  In youth, but oh! what happiness to live                           285</a>
<a id='line_1325'>  When every hour brings palpable access</a>
<a id='line_1326'>  Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,</a>
<a id='line_1327'>  And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,</a>
<a id='line_1328'>  And every season wheresoe'er I moved</a>
<a id='line_1329'>  Unfolded transitory qualities,                                     290</a>
<a id='line_1330'>  Which, but for this most watchful power of love,</a>
<a id='line_1331'>  Had been neglected; left a register</a>
<a id='line_1332'>  Of permanent relations, else unknown.</a>
<a id='line_1333'>  Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude</a>
<a id='line_1334'>  More active even than "best society"--[T]                          295</a>
<a id='line_1335'>  Society made sweet as solitude</a>
<a id='line_1336'>  By silent inobtrusive sympathies--</a>
<a id='line_1337'>  And gentle agitations of the mind</a>
<a id='line_1338'>  From manifold distinctions, difference</a>
<a id='line_1339'>  Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,                 300</a>
<a id='line_1340'>  No difference is, and hence, from the same source,</a>
<a id='line_1341'>  Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>  Under the quiet stars, and at that time</a>
<a id='line_1343'>  Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound</a>
<a id='line_1344'>  To breathe an elevated mood, by form                               305</a>
<a id='line_1345'>  Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,</a>
<a id='line_1346'>  If the night blackened with a coming storm,</a>
<a id='line_1347'>  Beneath some rock, listening to notes that are</a>
<a id='line_1348'>  The ghostly language of the ancient earth,</a>
<a id='line_1349'>  Or make their dim abode in distant winds.                          310</a>
<a id='line_1350'>  Thence did I drink the visionary power;</a>
<a id='line_1351'>  And deem not profitless those fleeting moods</a>

<a id='line_1355'>  Remembering how she felt, but what she felt</a>
<a id='line_1356'>  Remembering not, retains an obscure sense</a>
<a id='line_1357'>  Of possible sublimity, whereto</a>
<a id='line_1358'>  With growing faculties she doth aspire,</a>
<a id='line_1359'>  With faculties still growing, feeling still                        320</a>
<a id='line_1360'>  That whatsoever point they gain, they yet</a>
<a id='line_1361'>  Have something to pursue.</a>
<a id='line_1362'></a>
<a id='line_1363'>                                  And not alone,</a>

<a id='line_1370'>  A virtue not its own. My morning walks</a>

<a id='line_1378'>  Both silent to each other, at this time</a>
<a id='line_1379'>  We live as if those hours had never been.</a>
<a id='line_1380'>  Nor seldom did I lift--our cottage latch [X]</a>

<a id='line_1385'>  At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,</a>

<a id='line_1705'></a>
<a id='line_1706'>  It was a dreary morning when the wheels</a>
<a id='line_1707'>  Rolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds,</a>
<a id='line_1708'>  And nothing cheered our way till first we saw</a>
<a id='line_1709'>  The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  Turrets and pinnacles in answering files,                            5</a>
<a id='line_1711'>  Extended high above a dusky grove, [A]</a>
<a id='line_1712'></a>
<a id='line_1713'>    Advancing, we espied upon the road</a>
<a id='line_1714'>  A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap,</a>
<a id='line_1715'>  Striding along as if o'ertasked by Time,</a>
<a id='line_1716'>  Or covetous of exercise and air;                                    10</a>
<a id='line_1717'>  He passed--nor was I master of my eyes</a>
<a id='line_1718'>  Till he was left an arrow's flight behind.</a>
<a id='line_1719'>  As near and nearer to the spot we drew,</a>
<a id='line_1720'>  It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.</a>
<a id='line_1721'>  Onward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,                         15</a>
<a id='line_1722'>  While crossing Magdalene Bridge, a glimpse of Cam;</a>
<a id='line_1723'>  And at the 'Hoop' alighted, famous Inn. [B]</a>
<a id='line_1724'></a>
<a id='line_1725'>    My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;</a>
<a id='line_1726'>  Some friends I had, acquaintances who there</a>
<a id='line_1727'>  Seemed friends, poor simple school-boys, now hung round             20</a>
<a id='line_1728'>  With honour and importance: in a world</a>
<a id='line_1729'>  Of welcome faces up and down I roved;</a>
<a id='line_1730'>  Questions, directions, warnings and advice,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>  Flowed in upon me, from all sides; fresh day</a>
<a id='line_1732'>  Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed                           25</a>
<a id='line_1733'>  A man of business and expense, and went</a>
<a id='line_1734'>  From shop to shop about my own affairs,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>  To Tutor or to Tailor, as befel,</a>
<a id='line_1736'>  From street to street with loose and careless mind.</a>
<a id='line_1737'></a>
<a id='line_1738'>    I was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roamed                       30</a>
<a id='line_1739'>  Delighted through the motley spectacle;</a>
<a id='line_1740'>  Gowns, grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,</a>
<a id='line_1741'>  Courts, cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:</a>
<a id='line_1742'>  Migration strange for a stripling of the hills,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>  A northern villager.</a>
<a id='line_1744'>                         As if the change                             35</a>
<a id='line_1745'>  Had waited on some Fairy's wand, at once</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  Behold me rich in monies, and attired</a>
<a id='line_1747'>  In splendid garb, with hose of silk, and hair</a>
<a id='line_1748'>  Powdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen.</a>
<a id='line_1749'>  My lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by,                              40</a>
<a id='line_1750'>  With other signs of manhood that supplied</a>
<a id='line_1751'>  The lack of beard.--The weeks went roundly on,</a>
<a id='line_1752'>  With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,</a>
<a id='line_1753'>  Smooth housekeeping within, and all without</a>
<a id='line_1754'>  Liberal, and suiting gentleman's array.                             45</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>    The Evangelist St. John my patron was:</a>
<a id='line_1757'>  Three Gothic courts are his, and in the first</a>
<a id='line_1758'>  Was my abiding-place, a nook obscure; [C]</a>
<a id='line_1759'>  Right underneath, the College kitchens made</a>
<a id='line_1760'>  A humming sound, less tuneable than bees,                           50</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  But hardly less industrious; with shrill notes</a>
<a id='line_1762'>  Of sharp command and scolding intermixed.</a>
<a id='line_1763'>  Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,</a>
<a id='line_1764'>  Who never let the quarters, night or day,</a>
<a id='line_1765'>  Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours                        55</a>
<a id='line_1766'>  Twice over with a male and female voice.</a>
<a id='line_1767'>  Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;</a>
<a id='line_1768'>  And from my pillow, looking forth by light</a>
<a id='line_1769'>  Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold</a>
<a id='line_1770'>  The antechapel where the statue stood                               60</a>
<a id='line_1771'>  Of Newton with his prism and silent face,</a>
<a id='line_1772'>  The marble index of a mind for ever</a>
<a id='line_1773'>  Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>    Of College labours, of the Lecturer's room</a>
<a id='line_1776'>  All studded round, as thick as chairs could stand,                  65</a>
<a id='line_1777'>  With loyal students faithful to their books,</a>
<a id='line_1778'>  Half-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,</a>
<a id='line_1779'>  And honest dunces--of important days,</a>
<a id='line_1780'>  Examinations, when the man was weighed</a>
<a id='line_1781'>  As in a balance! of excessive hopes,                                70</a>
<a id='line_1782'>  Tremblings withal and commendable fears,</a>
<a id='line_1783'>  Small jealousies, and triumphs good or bad,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>  Let others that know more speak as they know.</a>
<a id='line_1785'>  Such glory was but little sought by me,</a>
<a id='line_1786'>  And little won. Yet from the first crude days                       75</a>
<a id='line_1787'>  Of settling time in this untried abode,</a>
<a id='line_1788'>  I was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_1789'>  Wishing to hope without a hope, some fears</a>
<a id='line_1790'>  About my future worldly maintenance,</a>
<a id='line_1791'>  And, more than all, a strangeness in the mind,                      80</a>
<a id='line_1792'>  A feeling that I was not for that hour,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>  Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast down?</a>
<a id='line_1794'>  For (not to speak of Reason and her pure</a>
<a id='line_1795'>  Reflective acts to fix the moral law</a>
<a id='line_1796'>  Deep in the conscience, nor of Christian Hope,                      85</a>
<a id='line_1797'>  Bowing her head before her sister Faith</a>
<a id='line_1798'>  As one far mightier), hither I had come,</a>
<a id='line_1799'>  Bear witness Truth, endowed with holy powers</a>
<a id='line_1800'>  And faculties, whether to work or feel.</a>
<a id='line_1801'>  Oft when the dazzling show no longer new                            90</a>
<a id='line_1802'>  Had ceased to dazzle, ofttimes did I quit</a>
<a id='line_1803'>  My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,</a>
<a id='line_1804'>  And as I paced alone the level fields</a>
<a id='line_1805'>  Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime</a>
<a id='line_1806'>  With which I had been conversant, the mind                          95</a>
<a id='line_1807'>  Drooped not; but there into herself returning,</a>
<a id='line_1808'>  With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.</a>
<a id='line_1809'>  At least I more distinctly recognised</a>
<a id='line_1810'>  Her native instincts: let me dare to speak</a>
<a id='line_1811'>  A higher language, say that now I felt                             100</a>
<a id='line_1812'>  What independent solaces were mine,</a>
<a id='line_1813'>  To mitigate the injurious sway of place</a>
<a id='line_1814'>  Or circumstance, how far soever changed</a>
<a id='line_1815'>  In youth, or to be changed in manhood's prime;</a>
<a id='line_1816'>  Or for the few who shall be called to look                         105</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  On the long shadows in our evening years,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>  Ordained precursors to the night of death.</a>
<a id='line_1819'>  As if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained,</a>
<a id='line_1820'>  I looked for universal things; perused</a>
<a id='line_1821'>  The common countenance of earth and sky:                           110</a>
<a id='line_1822'>  Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;</a>
<a id='line_1824'>  And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed</a>
<a id='line_1825'>  By the proud name she bears--the name of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  I called on both to teach me what they might;                      115</a>
<a id='line_1827'>  Or turning the mind in upon herself</a>
<a id='line_1828'>  Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_1829'>  And spread them with a wider creeping; felt</a>
<a id='line_1830'>  Incumbencies more awful, visitings</a>
<a id='line_1831'>  Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,                              120</a>
<a id='line_1832'>  That tolerates the indignities of Time,</a>
<a id='line_1833'>  And, from the centre of Eternity</a>
<a id='line_1834'>  All finite motions overruling, lives</a>
<a id='line_1835'>  In glory immutable. But peace! enough</a>
<a id='line_1836'>  Here to record that I was mounting now                             125</a>
<a id='line_1837'>  To such community with highest truth--</a>
<a id='line_1838'>  A track pursuing, not untrod before,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>  From strict analogies by thought supplied</a>
<a id='line_1840'>  Or consciousnesses not to be subdued.</a>
<a id='line_1841'>  To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,                      130</a>
<a id='line_1842'>  Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,</a>
<a id='line_1843'>  I gave a moral life: I saw them feel,</a>
<a id='line_1844'>  Or linked them to some feeling: the great mass</a>
<a id='line_1845'>  Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all</a>
<a id='line_1846'>  That I beheld respired with inward meaning.                        135</a>
<a id='line_1847'>  Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love</a>
<a id='line_1848'>  Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on</a>
<a id='line_1849'>  From transitory passion, unto this</a>
<a id='line_1850'>  I was as sensitive as waters are</a>
<a id='line_1851'>  To the sky's influence in a kindred mood                           140</a>
<a id='line_1852'>  Of passion; was obedient as a lute</a>
<a id='line_1853'>  That waits upon the touches of the wind.</a>
<a id='line_1854'>  Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich--</a>
<a id='line_1855'>  I had a world about me--'twas my own;</a>
<a id='line_1856'>  I made it, for it only lived to me,                                145</a>
<a id='line_1857'>  And to the God who sees into the heart.</a>
<a id='line_1858'>  Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed</a>
<a id='line_1859'>  By outward gestures and by visible looks:</a>
<a id='line_1860'>  Some called it madness--so indeed it was,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>  If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,                         150</a>
<a id='line_1862'>  If steady moods of thoughtfulness matured</a>
<a id='line_1863'>  To inspiration, sort with such a name;</a>
<a id='line_1864'>  If prophecy be madness; if things viewed</a>
<a id='line_1865'>  By poets in old time, and higher up</a>
<a id='line_1866'>  By the first men, earth's first inhabitants,                       155</a>
<a id='line_1867'>  May in these tutored days no more be seen</a>
<a id='line_1868'>  With undisordered sight. But leaving this,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>  It was no madness, for the bodily eye</a>
<a id='line_1870'>  Amid my strongest workings evermore</a>
<a id='line_1871'>  Was searching out the lines of difference                          160</a>
<a id='line_1872'>  As they lie hid in all external forms,</a>
<a id='line_1873'>  Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye</a>
<a id='line_1874'>  Which from a tree, a stone, a withered leaf,</a>
<a id='line_1875'>  To the broad ocean and the azure heavens</a>
<a id='line_1876'>  Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,                         165</a>
<a id='line_1877'>  Could find no surface where its power might sleep;</a>
<a id='line_1878'>  Which spake perpetual logic to my soul,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>  And by an unrelenting agency</a>
<a id='line_1880'>  Did bind my feelings even as in a chain.</a>
<a id='line_1881'></a>
<a id='line_1882'>    And here, O Friend! have I retraced my life                      170</a>
<a id='line_1883'>  Up to an eminence, and told a tale</a>
<a id='line_1884'>  Of matters which not falsely may be called</a>
<a id='line_1885'>  The glory of my youth. Of genius, power,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>  Creation and divinity itself</a>
<a id='line_1887'>  I have been speaking, for my theme has been                        175</a>
<a id='line_1888'>  What passed within me. Not of outward things</a>
<a id='line_1889'>  Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>  Symbols or actions, but of my own heart</a>
<a id='line_1891'>  Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind.</a>
<a id='line_1892'>  O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,                        180</a>
<a id='line_1893'>  And what they do within themselves while yet</a>
<a id='line_1894'>  The yoke of earth is new to them, the world</a>
<a id='line_1895'>  Nothing but a wild field where they were sown.</a>
<a id='line_1896'>  This is, in truth, heroic argument,</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  This genuine prowess, which I wished to touch                      185</a>
<a id='line_1898'>  With hand however weak, but in the main</a>
<a id='line_1899'>  It lies far hidden from the reach of words.</a>
<a id='line_1900'>  Points have we all of us within our souls</a>
<a id='line_1901'>  Where all stand single; this I feel, and make</a>
<a id='line_1902'>  Breathings for incommunicable powers;                              190</a>
<a id='line_1903'>  But is not each a memory to himself?</a>
<a id='line_1904'>  And, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  I am not heartless, for there's not a man</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  And feels not what an empire we inherit                            195</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  As natural beings in the strength of Nature.</a>
<a id='line_1909'></a>
<a id='line_1910'>    No more: for now into a populous plain</a>
<a id='line_1911'>  We must descend. A Traveller I am,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  Whose tale is only of himself; even so,</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt                           200</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  To follow, and if thou, my honoured Friend!</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  Who in these thoughts art ever at my side,</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps.</a>
<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>    It hath been told, that when the first delight</a>
<a id='line_1919'>  That flashed upon me from this novel show                          205</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  Had failed, the mind returned into herself;</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  Yet true it is, that I had made a change</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  In climate, and my nature's outward coat</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  Changed also slowly and insensibly.</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts                            210</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  Of loneliness gave way to empty noise</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  And superficial pastimes; now and then</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  Forced labour, and more frequently forced hopes;</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  And, worst of all, a treasonable growth</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  Of indecisive judgments, that impaired                             215</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  And shook the mind's simplicity.--And yet</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  This was a gladsome time. Could I behold--</a>
<a id='line_1932'>  Who, less insensible than sodden clay</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>  Could have beheld,--with undelighted heart,                        220</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  So many happy youths, so wide and fair</a>
<a id='line_1936'>  A congregation in its budding-time</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once</a>
<a id='line_1938'>  So many divers samples from the growth</a>
<a id='line_1939'>  Of life's sweet season--could have seen unmoved                    225</a>
<a id='line_1940'>  That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers</a>
<a id='line_1941'>  Decking the matron temples of a place</a>
<a id='line_1942'>  So famous through the world? To me, at least,</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,</a>
<a id='line_1944'>  Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped,                    230</a>
<a id='line_1945'>  And independent musings pleased me so</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  That spells seemed on me when I was alone,</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  Yet could I only cleave to solitude</a>
<a id='line_1948'>  In lonely places; if a throng was near</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  That way I leaned by nature; for my heart                          235</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  Was social, and loved idleness and joy.</a>
<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>    Not seeking those who might participate</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs,</a>
<a id='line_1955'>  Even with myself divided such delight,                             240</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed</a>

<a id='line_2216'>  Who only misses what I missed, who falls                           495</a>
<a id='line_2217'>  No lower than I fell.</a>
<a id='line_2218'></a>
<a id='line_2219'>                           I did not love,</a>
<a id='line_2220'>  Judging not ill perhaps, the timid course</a>
<a id='line_2221'>  Of our scholastic studies; could have wished</a>
<a id='line_2222'>  To see the river flow with ampler range</a>
<a id='line_2223'>  And freer pace; but more, far more, I grieved                      500</a>
<a id='line_2224'>  To see displayed among an eager few,</a>
<a id='line_2225'>  Who in the field of contest persevered,</a>
<a id='line_2226'>  Passions unworthy of youth's generous heart</a>
<a id='line_2227'>  And mounting spirit, pitiably repaid,</a>
<a id='line_2228'>  When so disturbed, whatever palms are won.                         505</a>
<a id='line_2229'>  From these I turned to travel with the shoal</a>
<a id='line_2230'>  Of more unthinking natures, easy minds</a>
<a id='line_2231'>  And pillowy; yet not wanting love that makes</a>
<a id='line_2232'>  The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps,</a>
<a id='line_2233'>  And wisdom and the pledges interchanged                            510</a>
<a id='line_2234'>  With our own inner being are forgot.</a>
<a id='line_2235'></a>
<a id='line_2236'>    Yet was this deep vacation not given up</a>
<a id='line_2237'>  To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood</a>
<a id='line_2238'>  In my own mind remote from social life,</a>
<a id='line_2239'>  (At least from what we commonly so name,)                          515</a>
<a id='line_2240'>  Like a lone shepherd on a promontory</a>
<a id='line_2241'>  Who lacking occupation looks far forth</a>
<a id='line_2242'>  Into the boundless sea, and rather makes</a>
<a id='line_2243'>  Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,</a>
<a id='line_2244'>  That this first transit from the smooth delights                   520</a>
<a id='line_2245'>  And wild outlandish walks of simple youth</a>
<a id='line_2246'>  To something that resembles an approach</a>
<a id='line_2247'>  Towards human business, to a privileged world</a>
<a id='line_2248'>  Within a world, a midway residence</a>
<a id='line_2249'>  With all its intervenient imagery,                                 525</a>
<a id='line_2250'>  Did better suit my visionary mind,</a>
<a id='line_2251'>  Far better, than to have been bolted forth;</a>
<a id='line_2252'>  Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way</a>
<a id='line_2253'>  Among the conflicts of substantial life;</a>
<a id='line_2254'>  By a more just gradation did lead on                               530</a>
<a id='line_2255'>  To higher things; more naturally matured,</a>
<a id='line_2256'>  For permanent possession, better fruits,</a>
<a id='line_2257'>  Whether of truth or virtue, to ensue.</a>
<a id='line_2258'>  In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,</a>
<a id='line_2259'>  With playful zest of fancy did we note                             535</a>
<a id='line_2260'>  (How could we less?) the manners and the ways</a>
<a id='line_2261'>  Of those who lived distinguished by the badge</a>
<a id='line_2262'>  Of good or ill report; or those with whom</a>
<a id='line_2263'>  By frame of Academic discipline</a>
<a id='line_2264'>  We were perforce connected, men whose sway                         540</a>
<a id='line_2265'>  And known authority of office served</a>
<a id='line_2266'>  To set our minds on edge, and did no more.</a>
<a id='line_2267'>  Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,</a>
<a id='line_2268'>  Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring</a>
<a id='line_2269'>  Of the grave Elders, men unsecured, grotesque                      545</a>
<a id='line_2270'>  In character, tricked out like aged trees</a>
<a id='line_2271'>  Which through the lapse of their infirmity</a>
<a id='line_2272'>  Give ready place to any random seed</a>

<a id='line_2274'></a>
<a id='line_2275'>    Here on my view, confronting vividly                             550</a>
<a id='line_2276'>  Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left,</a>
<a id='line_2277'>  Appeared a different aspect of old age;</a>
<a id='line_2278'>  How different! yet both distinctly marked,</a>
<a id='line_2279'>  Objects embossed to catch the general eye,</a>
<a id='line_2280'>  Or portraitures for special use designed,                          555</a>
<a id='line_2281'>  As some might seem, so aptly do they serve</a>
<a id='line_2282'>  To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments--</a>
<a id='line_2283'>  That book upheld as with maternal care</a>
<a id='line_2284'>  When she would enter on her tender scheme</a>
<a id='line_2285'>  Of teaching comprehension with delight,                            560</a>
<a id='line_2286'>  And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2287'></a>
<a id='line_2288'>    The surfaces of artificial life</a>
<a id='line_2289'>  And manners finely wrought, the delicate race</a>
<a id='line_2290'>  Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down</a>
<a id='line_2291'>  Through that state arras woven with silk and gold;                 565</a>
<a id='line_2292'>  This wily interchange of snaky hues,</a>
<a id='line_2293'>  Willingly or unwillingly revealed,</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  I neither knew nor cared for; and as such</a>
<a id='line_2295'>  Were wanting here, I took what might be found</a>
<a id='line_2296'>  Of less elaborate fabric. At this day                              570</a>
<a id='line_2297'>  I smile, in many a mountain solitude</a>
<a id='line_2298'>  Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks</a>
<a id='line_2299'>  Of character, in points of wit as broad,</a>
<a id='line_2300'>  As aught by wooden images performed</a>
<a id='line_2301'>  For entertainment of the gaping crowd                              575</a>
<a id='line_2302'>  At wake or fair. And oftentimes do flit</a>
<a id='line_2303'>  Remembrances before me of old men--</a>
<a id='line_2304'>  Old humourists, who have been long in their graves,</a>
<a id='line_2305'>  And having almost in my mind put off</a>
<a id='line_2306'>  Their human names, have into phantoms passed                       580</a>
<a id='line_2307'>  Of texture midway between life and books.</a>
<a id='line_2308'></a>
<a id='line_2309'>    I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note</a>
<a id='line_2310'>  That here in dwarf proportions were expressed</a>
<a id='line_2311'>  The limbs of the great world; its eager strifes</a>
<a id='line_2312'>  Collaterally pourtrayed, as in mock fight,                         585</a>
<a id='line_2313'>  A tournament of blows, some hardly dealt</a>
<a id='line_2314'>  Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er</a>

<a id='line_2316'>  An artless rustic's notice, this way less,</a>
<a id='line_2317'>  More that way, was not wasted upon me--590</a>
<a id='line_2318'>  And yet the spectacle may well demand</a>
<a id='line_2319'>  A more substantial name, no mimic show,</a>
<a id='line_2320'>  Itself a living part of a live whole,</a>
<a id='line_2321'>  A creek in the vast sea; for, all degrees</a>
<a id='line_2322'>  And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise                 595</a>
<a id='line_2323'>  Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms</a>
<a id='line_2324'>  Retainers won away from solid good;</a>
<a id='line_2325'>  And here was Labour, his own bond-slave; Hope,</a>
<a id='line_2326'>  That never set the pains against the prize;</a>
<a id='line_2327'>  Idleness halting with his weary clog,                              600</a>

<a id='line_2329'>  And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;</a>
<a id='line_2330'>  Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray;</a>
<a id='line_2331'>  Feuds, factions, flatteries, enmity, and guile</a>
<a id='line_2332'>  Murmuring submission, and bald government,                         605</a>

<a id='line_2413'>illustrates the above and other passages of this book. It was written</a>
<a id='line_2414'>from Forncett, on the 26th of June, 1791. She is speaking of her two</a>
<a id='line_2415'>brothers, William and Christopher. Of Christopher she says:</a>
<a id='line_2416'></a>
<a id='line_2417'>  "His abilities, though not so great, perhaps, as his brother's, may be</a>
<a id='line_2418'>  of more use to him, as he has not fixed his mind upon any particular</a>
<a id='line_2419'>  species of reading or conceived an aversion to any. He is not fond of</a>
<a id='line_2420'>  mathematics, but has resolution sufficient to study them; because it</a>
<a id='line_2421'>  will be impossible for him to obtain a fellowship without them.</a>
<a id='line_2422'>  William lost the chance, indeed the certainty, of a fellowship, by not</a>
<a id='line_2423'>  combating his inclinations. He gave way to his natural dislike to</a>
<a id='line_2424'>  studies so dry as many parts of the mathematics, consequently could</a>
<a id='line_2425'>  not succeed in Cambridge. He reads Italian, Spanish, French, Greek,</a>
<a id='line_2426'>  Latin, and English; but never opens a mathematical book.... Do not</a>
<a id='line_2427'>  think from what I have said that he reads not at all; for he does read</a>
<a id='line_2428'>  a great deal, and not only poetry, in these languages he is acquainted</a>

<a id='line_2460'>  Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_2461'>  With exultation, at my feet I saw</a>
<a id='line_2462'>  Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,</a>
<a id='line_2463'>  A universe of Nature's fairest forms</a>
<a id='line_2464'>  Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,                          10</a>
<a id='line_2465'>  Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.</a>
<a id='line_2466'>  I bounded down the hill shouting amain</a>

<a id='line_2500'>  The rooms, the court, the garden were not left</a>
<a id='line_2501'>  Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat</a>
<a id='line_2502'>  Round the stone table under the dark pine, [K]</a>
<a id='line_2503'>  Friendly to studious or to festive hours;</a>
<a id='line_2504'>  Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,                            50</a>
<a id='line_2505'>  The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed</a>
<a id='line_2506'>  Within our garden, [L] found himself at once,</a>
<a id='line_2507'>  As if by trick insidious and unkind,</a>
<a id='line_2508'>  Stripped of his voice [M] and left to dimple down</a>
<a id='line_2509'>  (Without an effort and without a will)                              55</a>
<a id='line_2510'>  A channel paved by man's officious care. [N]</a>
<a id='line_2511'>  I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,</a>
<a id='line_2512'>  And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, [O]</a>
<a id='line_2513'>  "Ha," quoth I, "pretty prisoner, are you there!"</a>
<a id='line_2514'>  Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,                     60</a>
<a id='line_2515'>  "An emblem here behold of thy own life;</a>
<a id='line_2516'>  In its late course of even days with all</a>
<a id='line_2517'>  Their smooth enthralment;" but the heart was full,</a>
<a id='line_2518'>  Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame</a>
<a id='line_2519'>  Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;                           65</a>
<a id='line_2520'>  I willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.</a>
<a id='line_2521'>--The face of every neighbour whom I met</a>
<a id='line_2522'>  Was like a volume to me; some were hailed</a>
<a id='line_2523'>  Upon the road, some busy at their work,</a>
<a id='line_2524'>  Unceremonious greetings interchanged                                70</a>
<a id='line_2525'>  With half the length of a long field between.</a>
<a id='line_2526'>  Among my schoolfellows I scattered round</a>
<a id='line_2527'>  Like recognitions, but with some constraint</a>
<a id='line_2528'>  Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>  But with more shame, for my habiliments,                            75</a>
<a id='line_2530'>  The transformation wrought by gay attire.</a>
<a id='line_2531'>  Not less delighted did I take my place</a>
<a id='line_2532'>  At our domestic table: and, [P] dear Friend</a>
<a id='line_2533'>  In this endeavour simply to relate</a>
<a id='line_2534'>  A Poet's history, may I leave untold                                80</a>
<a id='line_2535'>  The thankfulness with which I laid me down</a>
<a id='line_2536'>  In my accustomed bed, more welcome now</a>
<a id='line_2537'>  Perhaps than if it had been more desired</a>
<a id='line_2538'>  Or been more often thought of with regret;</a>
<a id='line_2539'>  That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind                          85</a>
<a id='line_2540'>  Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft</a>
<a id='line_2541'>  Had lain awake on summer nights to watch</a>
<a id='line_2542'>  The moon in splendour couched among the leaves</a>
<a id='line_2543'>  Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood; [Q]</a>
<a id='line_2544'>  Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro                    90</a>
<a id='line_2545'>  In the dark summit of the waving tree</a>
<a id='line_2546'>  She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.</a>
<a id='line_2547'></a>
<a id='line_2548'>    Among the favourites whom it pleased me well</a>
<a id='line_2549'>  To see again, was one by ancient right</a>
<a id='line_2550'>  Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;                           95</a>
<a id='line_2551'>  By birth and call of nature pre-ordained</a>
<a id='line_2552'>  To hunt the badger and unearth the fox</a>
<a id='line_2553'>  Among the impervious crags, but having been</a>
<a id='line_2554'>  From youth our own adopted, he had passed</a>
<a id='line_2555'>  Into a gentler service. And when first                             100</a>
<a id='line_2556'>  The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day</a>
<a id='line_2557'>  Along my veins I kindled with the stir,</a>
<a id='line_2558'>  The fermentation, and the vernal heat</a>
<a id='line_2559'>  Of poesy, affecting private shades</a>
<a id='line_2560'>  Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used                          105</a>
<a id='line_2561'>  To watch me, an attendant and a friend,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>  Obsequious to my steps early and late,</a>
<a id='line_2563'>  Though often of such dilatory walk</a>
<a id='line_2564'>  Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.</a>
<a id='line_2565'>  A hundred times when, roving high and low                          110</a>
<a id='line_2566'>  I have been harassed with the toil of verse,</a>
<a id='line_2567'>  Much pains and little progress, and at once</a>
<a id='line_2568'>  Some lovely Image in the song rose up</a>
<a id='line_2569'>  Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;</a>
<a id='line_2570'>  Then have I darted forwards to let                                 115</a>
<a id='line_2571'>  My hand upon his back with stormy joy,</a>
<a id='line_2572'>  Caressing him again and yet again.</a>
<a id='line_2573'>  And when at evening on the public way</a>
<a id='line_2574'>  I sauntered, like a river murmuring</a>
<a id='line_2575'>  And talking to itself when all things                              120</a>
<a id='line_2576'>  Are still, the creature trotted on before;</a>
<a id='line_2577'>  Such was his custom; but whene'er he met</a>
<a id='line_2578'>  A passenger approaching, he would turn</a>
<a id='line_2579'>  To give me timely notice, and straightway,</a>
<a id='line_2580'>  Grateful for that admonishment, I                                  125</a>
<a id='line_2581'>  My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air</a>
<a id='line_2582'>  And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced</a>
<a id='line_2583'>  To give and take a greeting that might save</a>
<a id='line_2584'>  My name from piteous rumours, such as wait</a>
<a id='line_2585'>  On men suspected to be crazed in brain.                            130</a>
<a id='line_2586'></a>
<a id='line_2587'>  Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved--</a>
<a id='line_2588'>  Regretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,</a>
<a id='line_2589'>  But they were richly laden with all good,</a>
<a id='line_2590'>  And cannot be remembered but with thanks</a>
<a id='line_2591'>  And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart--135</a>
<a id='line_2592'>  Those walks in all their freshness now came back</a>
<a id='line_2593'>  Like a returning Spring. When first I made</a>
<a id='line_2594'>  Once more the circuit of our little lake,</a>
<a id='line_2595'>  If ever happiness hath lodged with man,</a>
<a id='line_2596'>  That day consummate happiness was mine,                            140</a>
<a id='line_2597'>  Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.</a>
<a id='line_2598'>  The sun was set, or setting, when I left</a>
<a id='line_2599'>  Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on</a>
<a id='line_2600'>  A sober hour, not winning or serene,</a>
<a id='line_2601'>  For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;                         145</a>
<a id='line_2602'>  But as a face we love is sweetest then</a>
<a id='line_2603'>  When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look</a>
<a id='line_2604'>  It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart</a>
<a id='line_2605'>  Have fulness in herself; even so with me</a>
<a id='line_2606'>  It fared that evening. Gently did my soul                          150</a>
<a id='line_2607'>  Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood</a>
<a id='line_2608'>  Naked, as in the presence of her God.</a>
<a id='line_2609'>  While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch</a>
<a id='line_2610'>  A heart that had not been disconsolate:</a>
<a id='line_2611'>  Strength came where weakness was not known to be,                  155</a>
<a id='line_2612'>  At least not felt; and restoration came</a>
<a id='line_2613'>  Like an intruder knocking at the door</a>
<a id='line_2614'>  Of unacknowledged weariness. I took</a>
<a id='line_2615'>  The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.</a>
<a id='line_2616'>--Of that external scene which round me lay,                       160</a>
<a id='line_2617'>  Little, in this abstraction, did I see;</a>
<a id='line_2618'>  Remembered less; but I had inward hopes</a>
<a id='line_2619'>  And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,</a>
<a id='line_2620'>  Conversed with promises, had glimmering views</a>
<a id='line_2621'>  How life pervades the undecaying mind;                             165</a>
<a id='line_2622'>  How the immortal soul with God-like power</a>
<a id='line_2623'>  Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep</a>
<a id='line_2624'>  That time can lay upon her; how on earth,</a>
<a id='line_2625'>  Man, if he do but live within the light</a>
<a id='line_2626'>  Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad                           170</a>
<a id='line_2627'>  His being armed with strength that cannot fail.</a>
<a id='line_2628'>  Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love</a>
<a id='line_2629'>  Of innocence, and holiday repose;</a>
<a id='line_2630'>  And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir</a>
<a id='line_2631'>  Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end                            175</a>
<a id='line_2632'>  At last, or glorious, by endurance won.</a>
<a id='line_2633'>  Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down</a>
<a id='line_2634'>  Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes</a>
<a id='line_2635'>  And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread</a>
<a id='line_2636'>  With darkness, and before a rippling breeze                        180</a>
<a id='line_2637'>  The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,</a>
<a id='line_2638'>  And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,</a>
<a id='line_2639'>  Around me from among the hazel leaves,</a>
<a id='line_2640'>  Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,</a>
<a id='line_2641'>  Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,                            185</a>
<a id='line_2642'>  Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,</a>
<a id='line_2643'>  The off and on companion of my walk;</a>
<a id='line_2644'>  And such, at times, believing them to be,</a>
<a id='line_2645'>  I turned my head to look if he were there;</a>
<a id='line_2646'>  Then into solemn thought I passed once more.                       190</a>
<a id='line_2647'></a>
<a id='line_2648'>  A freshness also found I at this time</a>
<a id='line_2649'>  In human Life, the daily life of those</a>
<a id='line_2650'>  Whose occupations really I loved;</a>
<a id='line_2651'>  The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise</a>
<a id='line_2652'>  Changed like a garden in the heat of spring                        195</a>
<a id='line_2653'>  After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit</a>
<a id='line_2654'>  The things which were the same and yet appeared</a>
<a id='line_2655'>  Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,</a>
<a id='line_2656'>  A narrow Vale where each was known to all,</a>
<a id='line_2657'>  'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind                           200</a>
<a id='line_2658'>  To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,</a>
<a id='line_2659'>  Where an old man had used to sit alone,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>  Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left</a>
<a id='line_2661'>  In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet</a>
<a id='line_2662'>  Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;                       205</a>
<a id='line_2663'>  And growing girls whose beauty, filched away</a>
<a id='line_2664'>  With all its pleasant promises, was gone</a>
<a id='line_2665'>  To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.</a>
<a id='line_2666'></a>
<a id='line_2667'>    Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>  And often looking round was moved to smiles                        210</a>
<a id='line_2669'>  Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;</a>
<a id='line_2670'>  I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_2671'>  Of those plain-living people now observed</a>
<a id='line_2672'>  With clearer knowledge; with another eye</a>
<a id='line_2673'>  I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,                              215</a>
<a id='line_2674'>  The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,</a>
<a id='line_2675'>  This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;</a>
<a id='line_2676'>  Saw her go forth to church or other work</a>
<a id='line_2677'>  Of state, equipped in monumental trim;</a>
<a id='line_2678'>  Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),                      220</a>
<a id='line_2679'>  A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers</a>
<a id='line_2680'>  Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,</a>
<a id='line_2681'>  Affectionate without disquietude,</a>
<a id='line_2682'>  Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less</a>
<a id='line_2683'>  Her clear though shallow stream of piety                           225</a>
<a id='line_2684'>  That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;</a>
<a id='line_2685'>  With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read</a>
<a id='line_2686'>  Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,</a>
<a id='line_2687'>  And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep</a>
<a id='line_2688'>  And made of it a pillow for her head.                              230</a>
<a id='line_2689'></a>
<a id='line_2690'>    Nor less do I remember to have felt,</a>
<a id='line_2691'>  Distinctly manifested at this time,</a>
<a id='line_2692'>  A human-heartedness about my love</a>
<a id='line_2693'>  For objects hitherto the absolute wealth</a>
<a id='line_2694'>  Of my own private being and no more:                               235</a>
<a id='line_2695'>  Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit</a>
<a id='line_2696'>  Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,</a>
<a id='line_2697'>  Might love in individual happiness.</a>
<a id='line_2698'>  But now there opened on me other thoughts</a>
<a id='line_2699'>  Of change, congratulation or regret,                               240</a>
<a id='line_2700'>  A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;</a>
<a id='line_2701'>  The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,</a>
<a id='line_2702'>  The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts--</a>
<a id='line_2703'>  White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,</a>
<a id='line_2704'>  Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,                         245</a>
<a id='line_2705'>  Acquaintances of every little child,</a>
<a id='line_2706'>  And Jupiter, my own beloved star!</a>
<a id='line_2707'>  Whatever shadings of mortality,</a>
<a id='line_2708'>  Whatever imports from the world of death</a>
<a id='line_2709'>  Had come among these objects heretofore,                           250</a>
<a id='line_2710'>  Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,</a>
<a id='line_2711'>  Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings</a>
<a id='line_2712'>  Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way</a>
<a id='line_2713'>  In later youth to yearnings of a love</a>
<a id='line_2714'>  Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.                                 255</a>
<a id='line_2715'></a>
<a id='line_2716'>    As one who hangs down-bending from the side</a>
<a id='line_2717'>  Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast</a>
<a id='line_2718'>  Of a still water, solacing himself</a>
<a id='line_2719'>  With such discoveries as his eye can make</a>
<a id='line_2720'>  Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,                             260</a>
<a id='line_2721'>  Sees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers.</a>
<a id='line_2722'>  Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,</a>
<a id='line_2723'>  Yet often is perplexed and cannot part</a>
<a id='line_2724'>  The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,</a>
<a id='line_2725'>  Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth                       265</a>
<a id='line_2726'>  Of the clear flood, from things which there abide</a>
<a id='line_2727'>  In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam</a>
<a id='line_2728'>  Of his own image, by a sun-beam now,</a>
<a id='line_2729'>  And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,</a>
<a id='line_2730'>  Impediments that make his task more sweet;                         270</a>
<a id='line_2731'>  Such pleasant office have we long pursued</a>
<a id='line_2732'>  Incumbent o'er the surface of past time</a>
<a id='line_2733'>  With like success, nor often have appeared</a>
<a id='line_2734'>  Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned</a>
<a id='line_2735'>  Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!                    275</a>
<a id='line_2736'>  Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite</a>
<a id='line_2737'>  Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,</a>
<a id='line_2738'>  There was an inner falling off--I loved,</a>
<a id='line_2739'>  Loved deeply all that had been loved before,</a>
<a id='line_2740'>  More deeply even than ever: but a swarm                            280</a>
<a id='line_2741'>  Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,</a>
<a id='line_2742'>  And feast and dance, and public revelry,</a>
<a id='line_2743'>  And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,</a>
<a id='line_2744'>  Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,</a>
<a id='line_2745'>  Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh                         285</a>
<a id='line_2746'>  Of manliness and freedom) all conspired</a>
<a id='line_2747'>  To lure my mind from firm habitual quest</a>
<a id='line_2748'>  Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal</a>
<a id='line_2749'>  And damp those yearnings which had once been mine--</a>
<a id='line_2750'>  A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up                           290</a>
<a id='line_2751'>  To his own eager thoughts. It would demand</a>
<a id='line_2752'>  Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,</a>
<a id='line_2753'>  To paint these vanities, and how they wrought</a>
<a id='line_2754'>  In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.</a>
<a id='line_2755'>  It seemed the very garments that I wore                            295</a>
<a id='line_2756'>  Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream</a>
<a id='line_2757'>  Of self-forgetfulness.</a>
<a id='line_2758'>                         Yes, that heartless chase</a>
<a id='line_2759'>  Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange</a>
<a id='line_2760'>  For books and nature at that early age.</a>
<a id='line_2761'>  'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained                   300</a>
<a id='line_2762'>  Of character or life; but at that time,</a>
<a id='line_2763'>  Of manners put to school I took small note,</a>
<a id='line_2764'>  And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.</a>
<a id='line_2765'>  Far better had it been to exalt the mind</a>
<a id='line_2766'>  By solitary study, to uphold                                       305</a>
<a id='line_2767'>  Intense desire through meditative peace;</a>
<a id='line_2768'>  And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,</a>
<a id='line_2769'>  The memory of one particular hour</a>
<a id='line_2770'>  Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng</a>
<a id='line_2771'>  Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,                   310</a>
<a id='line_2772'>  A medley of all tempers, I had passed</a>
<a id='line_2773'>  The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>  With din of instruments and shuffling feet,</a>
<a id='line_2775'>  And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,</a>
<a id='line_2776'>  And unaimed prattle flying up and down; [R]                        315</a>
<a id='line_2777'>  Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there</a>
<a id='line_2778'>  Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,</a>
<a id='line_2779'>  Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,</a>
<a id='line_2780'>  And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,</a>
<a id='line_2781'>  The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky                       320</a>
<a id='line_2782'>  Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse</a>
<a id='line_2783'>  And open field, through which the pathway wound,</a>
<a id='line_2784'>  And homeward led my steps. Magnificent</a>
<a id='line_2785'>  The morning rose, in memorable pomp,</a>
<a id='line_2786'>  Glorious as e'er I had beheld--in front,                           325</a>
<a id='line_2787'>  The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,</a>
<a id='line_2788'>  The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,</a>
<a id='line_2789'>  Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;</a>
<a id='line_2790'>  And in the meadows and the lower grounds</a>
<a id='line_2791'>  Was all the sweetness of a common dawn--330</a>
<a id='line_2792'>  Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, [S]</a>
<a id='line_2793'>  And labourers going forth to till the fields.</a>
<a id='line_2794'>  Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim</a>
<a id='line_2795'>  My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows</a>
<a id='line_2796'>  Were then made for me; bond unknown to me                          335</a>
<a id='line_2797'>  Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,</a>
<a id='line_2798'>  A dedicated Spirit. On I walked</a>
<a id='line_2799'>  In thankful blessedness, which yet survives. [T]</a>
<a id='line_2800'></a>
<a id='line_2801'>    Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time</a>
<a id='line_2802'>  A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,                            340</a>
<a id='line_2803'>  Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;</a>
<a id='line_2804'>  Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,</a>
<a id='line_2805'>  Consorting in one mansion unreproved.</a>
<a id='line_2806'>  The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,</a>

<a id='line_2808'>  That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts</a>
<a id='line_2809'>  Transient and idle, lacked not intervals</a>
<a id='line_2810'>  When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time</a>
<a id='line_2811'>  Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself</a>
<a id='line_2812'>  Conformity as just as that of old                                  350</a>
<a id='line_2813'>  To the end and written spirit of God's works,</a>

<a id='line_2816'></a>
<a id='line_2817'>    When from our better selves we have too long</a>
<a id='line_2818'>  Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,                      355</a>
<a id='line_2819'>  Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,</a>
<a id='line_2820'>  How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;</a>
<a id='line_2821'>  How potent a mere image of her sway;</a>
<a id='line_2822'>  Most potent when impressed upon the mind</a>

<a id='line_2824'>  Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;</a>
<a id='line_2825'>  Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot</a>

<a id='line_2827'>  Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top</a>
<a id='line_2828'>  Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;                           365</a>
<a id='line_2829'>  Or as the soul of that great Power is met</a>
<a id='line_2830'>  Sometimes embodied on a public road,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>  When, for the night deserted, it assumes</a>
<a id='line_2832'>  A character of quiet more profound</a>

<a id='line_2834'>                      Once, when those summer months                 370</a>
<a id='line_2835'>  Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show</a>
<a id='line_2836'>  Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,</a>
<a id='line_2837'>  Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced</a>
<a id='line_2838'>  That--after I had left a flower-decked room</a>
<a id='line_2839'>  (Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived                       375</a>
<a id='line_2840'>  To a late hour), and spirits overwrought</a>
<a id='line_2841'>  Were making night do penance for a day</a>
<a id='line_2842'>  Spent in a round of strenuous idleness--[U]</a>
<a id='line_2843'>  My homeward course led up a long ascent,</a>
<a id='line_2844'>  Where the road's watery surface, to the top                        380</a>
<a id='line_2845'>  Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon</a>
<a id='line_2846'>  And bore the semblance of another stream</a>
<a id='line_2847'>  Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook</a>
<a id='line_2848'>  That murmured in the vale. [V] All else was still;</a>
<a id='line_2849'>  No living thing appeared in earth or air,                          385</a>
<a id='line_2850'>  And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,</a>
<a id='line_2851'>  Sound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,</a>
<a id='line_2852'>  Shown by a sudden turning of the road,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>  So near that, slipping back into the shade</a>
<a id='line_2854'>  Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,                        390</a>
<a id='line_2855'>  Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,</a>
<a id='line_2856'>  A span above man's common measure, tall,</a>
<a id='line_2857'>  Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man</a>
<a id='line_2858'>  Was never seen before by night or day.</a>
<a id='line_2859'>  Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth                    395</a>
<a id='line_2860'>  Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>  A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken</a>
<a id='line_2862'>  That he was clothed in military garb,</a>
<a id='line_2863'>  Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,</a>
<a id='line_2864'>  No dog attending, by no staff sustained,                           400</a>
<a id='line_2865'>  He stood, and in his very dress appeared</a>
<a id='line_2866'>  A desolation, a simplicity,</a>
<a id='line_2867'>  To which the trappings of a gaudy world</a>
<a id='line_2868'>  Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,</a>
<a id='line_2869'>  Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain                          405</a>
<a id='line_2870'>  Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form</a>
<a id='line_2871'>  Kept the same awful steadiness--at his feet</a>
<a id='line_2872'>  His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame</a>
<a id='line_2873'>  Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length</a>
<a id='line_2874'>  Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,                            410</a>
<a id='line_2875'>  I left the shady nook where I had stood</a>
<a id='line_2876'>  And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place</a>
<a id='line_2877'>  He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm</a>
<a id='line_2878'>  In measured gesture lifted to his head</a>
<a id='line_2879'>  Returned my salutation; then resumed                               415</a>
<a id='line_2880'>  His station as before; and when I asked</a>
<a id='line_2881'>  His history, the veteran, in reply,</a>
<a id='line_2882'>  Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,</a>
<a id='line_2883'>  And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,</a>
<a id='line_2884'>  A stately air of mild indifference,                                420</a>
<a id='line_2885'>  He told in few plain words a soldier's tale--</a>
<a id='line_2886'>  That in the Tropic Islands he had served,</a>
<a id='line_2887'>  Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past:</a>
<a id='line_2888'>  That on his landing he had been dismissed,</a>
<a id='line_2889'>  And now was travelling towards his native home.                    425</a>
<a id='line_2890'>  This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with me."</a>
<a id='line_2891'>  He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up</a>
<a id='line_2892'>  An oaken staff by me yet unobserved--</a>
<a id='line_2893'>  A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand</a>
<a id='line_2894'>  And lay till now neglected in the grass.                           430</a>
<a id='line_2895'>  Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared</a>
<a id='line_2896'>  To travel without pain, and I beheld,</a>
<a id='line_2897'>  With an astonishment but ill suppressed,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>  His ghostly figure moving at my side;</a>
<a id='line_2899'>  Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear                      435</a>
<a id='line_2900'>  To turn from present hardships to the past,</a>
<a id='line_2901'>  And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,</a>
<a id='line_2902'>  Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,</a>
<a id='line_2903'>  On what he might himself have seen or felt.</a>
<a id='line_2904'>  He all the while was in demeanour calm,                            440</a>
<a id='line_2905'>  Concise in answer; solemn and sublime</a>
<a id='line_2906'>  He might have seemed, but that in all he said</a>
<a id='line_2907'>  There was a strange half-absence, as of one</a>
<a id='line_2908'>  Knowing too well the importance of his theme,</a>
<a id='line_2909'>  But feeling it no longer. Our discourse                            445</a>
<a id='line_2910'>  Soon ended, and together on we passed</a>
<a id='line_2911'>  In silence through a wood gloomy and still.</a>
<a id='line_2912'>  Up-turning, then, along an open field,</a>
<a id='line_2913'>  We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,</a>
<a id='line_2914'>  And earnestly to charitable care                                   450</a>
<a id='line_2915'>  Commended him as a poor friendless man,</a>
<a id='line_2916'>  Belated and by sickness overcome.</a>
<a id='line_2917'>  Assured that now the traveller would repose</a>
<a id='line_2918'>  In comfort, I entreated that henceforth</a>
<a id='line_2919'>  He would not linger in the public ways,                            455</a>
<a id='line_2920'>  But ask for timely furtherance and help</a>
<a id='line_2921'>  Such as his state required. At this reproof,</a>
<a id='line_2922'>  With the same ghastly mildness in his look,</a>
<a id='line_2923'>  He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_2924'>  And in the eye of him who passes me!"                              460</a>
<a id='line_2925'></a>
<a id='line_2926'>    The cottage door was speedily unbarred,</a>
<a id='line_2927'>  And now the soldier touched his hat once more</a>
<a id='line_2928'>  With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,</a>
<a id='line_2929'>  Whose tone bespake reviving interests</a>
<a id='line_2930'>  Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned                        465</a>
<a id='line_2931'>  The farewell blessing of the patient man,</a>
<a id='line_2932'>  And so we parted. Back I cast a look,</a>
<a id='line_2933'>  And lingered near the door a little space,</a>
<a id='line_2934'>  Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.</a>

<a id='line_2977'>[Footnote H: Anne Tyson seems to have removed from Hawkshead village to</a>
<a id='line_2978'>Colthouse, on the opposite side of the Vale, and lived there for some</a>
<a id='line_2979'>time before her death. Along with Dr. Cradock I examined the Parish</a>
<a id='line_2980'>Registers of Hawkshead in the autumn of 1882, and we found the following</a>
<a id='line_2981'>entry belonging to the year 1796.</a>
<a id='line_2982'></a>
<a id='line_2983'>  "Anne Tyson of Colthouse, widow, died May 25th buried 28th, in</a>
<a id='line_2984'>  Churchyard, aged 83."</a>
<a id='line_2985'></a>
<a id='line_2986'>Her removal to Colthouse is confirmed, in a curious way, by a</a>
<a id='line_2987'>reminiscence of William Wordsworth's (the poet's son), who told me that</a>
<a id='line_2988'>if asked where the dame's house was, he would have pointed to a spot on</a>
<a id='line_2989'>the eastern side of the valley, and out of the village altogether; his</a>
<a id='line_2990'>father having taken him from Rydal Mount to Hawkshead when a mere boy,</a>
<a id='line_2991'>and pointed out that spot. Doubtless Wordsworth took his son to the</a>
<a id='line_2992'>cottage at Colthouse, where Anne Tyson died, as the earlier abode in</a>
<a id='line_2993'>Hawkshead village is well known, and its site is indisputable.--Ed.]</a>

<a id='line_3015'>brook" "within our garden" boxed, which gives the name of Flag Street to</a>
<a id='line_3016'>one of the alleys of Hawkshead.</a>
<a id='line_3017'></a>
<a id='line_3018'>  "Persons have visited the cottage," wrote Dr. Cradock, "without</a>
<a id='line_3019'>  discovering it; and yet it is not forty yards distant, and is still</a>
<a id='line_3020'>  exactly as described. On the opposite side of the lane leading to the</a>
<a id='line_3021'>  cottage, and a few steps above it, is a narrow passage through some</a>
<a id='line_3022'>  new stone buildings. On emerging from this, you meet a small garden,</a>
<a id='line_3023'>  the farther side of which is bounded by the brook, confined on both</a>
<a id='line_3024'>  sides by larger flags, and also covered by flags of the same Coniston</a>
<a id='line_3025'>  formation, through the interstices of which you may see and hear the</a>
<a id='line_3026'>  stream running freely. The upper flags are now used as a footpath, and</a>
<a id='line_3027'>  lead by another passage back into the village. No doubt the garden has</a>
<a id='line_3028'>  been reduced in size, by the use of that part of it fronting the lane</a>
<a id='line_3029'>  for building purposes. The stream, before it enters the area of</a>
<a id='line_3030'>  buildings and gardens, is open by the lane side, and seemingly comes</a>

<a id='line_3035'>The house adjoining this garden was not Dame Tyson's but a Mr. Watson's.</a>
<a id='line_3036'>Possibly, however, some of the boys had free access to the latter, so</a>
<a id='line_3037'>that Wordsworth could speak of it as "our garden;" or, Dame Tyson may</a>

<a id='line_3074'>traced out in the Hawkshead district, I am indebted to Mr. Rawnsley for</a>
<a id='line_3075'>the following note:</a>
<a id='line_3076'></a>
<a id='line_3077'>  "From the village, nay, from the poet's very door when he lived at</a>
<a id='line_3078'>  Anne Tyson's, a good path leads on, past the vicarage, quite to its</a>
<a id='line_3079'>  upland place of birth. It has eaten its way deeply into the soil; in</a>
<a id='line_3080'>  one place there is a series of still pools, that overflow and fall</a>
<a id='line_3081'>  into others, with quiet sound; at other spots, it is bustling and</a>
<a id='line_3082'>  busy. Fine timber is found on either side of it, the roots of the</a>
<a id='line_3083'>  trees often laid bare by the passing current. In one or two places by</a>
<a id='line_3084'>  the side of this beck, and beneath the shadow of lofty oaks, may be</a>
<a id='line_3085'>  found boulder stones, grey and moss-covered. Birds make hiding-places</a>
<a id='line_3086'>  for themselves in these oak and hazel bushes by the stream. Following</a>
<a id='line_3087'>  it up, we find it receives, at a tiny ford, the tribute of another</a>
<a id='line_3088'>  stream from the north-west, and comes down between the adjacent hills</a>
<a id='line_3089'>  (well wooded to the summit) from meadows of short-cropped grass, and</a>
<a id='line_3090'>  to these from the open moorland, where it takes its rise. Every</a>
<a id='line_3091'>  conceivable variety of beauty of sound and sight in streamlet life is</a>
<a id='line_3092'>  found as we follow the course of this Town Beck. We owe much of</a>
<a id='line_3093'>  Wordsworth's intimate acquaintance with streamlet beauty to it."</a>

<a id='line_3107'>Wordsworth's bedroom must have been that on the proper left, with the</a>

<a id='line_3225'></a>
<a id='line_3226'>    One day, when from my lips a like complaint                       50</a>
<a id='line_3227'>  Had fallen in presence of a studious friend,</a>
<a id='line_3228'>  He with a smile made answer, that in truth</a>
<a id='line_3229'>  'Twas going far to seek disquietude;</a>
<a id='line_3230'>  But on the front of his reproof confessed</a>
<a id='line_3231'>  That he himself had oftentimes given way                            55</a>
<a id='line_3232'>  To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,</a>
<a id='line_3233'>  That once in the stillness of a summer's noon,</a>
<a id='line_3234'>  While I was seated in a rocky cave</a>
<a id='line_3235'>  By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,</a>
<a id='line_3236'>  The famous history of the errant knight                             60</a>
<a id='line_3237'>  Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts</a>
<a id='line_3238'>  Beset me, and to height unusual rose,</a>
<a id='line_3239'>  While listlessly I sate, and, having closed</a>
<a id='line_3240'>  The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.</a>
<a id='line_3241'>  On poetry and geometric truth,                                      65</a>
<a id='line_3242'>  And their high privilege of lasting life,</a>
<a id='line_3243'>  From all internal injury exempt,</a>
<a id='line_3244'>  I mused, upon these chiefly: and at length,</a>
<a id='line_3245'>  My senses yielding to the sultry air,</a>
<a id='line_3246'>  Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream.                         70</a>
<a id='line_3247'>  I saw before me stretched a boundless plain</a>
<a id='line_3248'>  Of sandy wilderness, all black and void,</a>
<a id='line_3249'>  And as I looked around, distress and fear</a>
<a id='line_3250'>  Came creeping over me, when at my side,</a>
<a id='line_3251'>  Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared                         75</a>
<a id='line_3252'>  Upon a dromedary, mounted high.</a>
<a id='line_3253'>  He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:</a>
<a id='line_3254'>  A lance he bore, and underneath one arm</a>
<a id='line_3255'>  A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell</a>
<a id='line_3256'>  Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight                            80</a>
<a id='line_3257'>  Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide</a>
<a id='line_3258'>  Was present, one who with unerring skill</a>
<a id='line_3259'>  Would through the desert lead me; and while yet</a>
<a id='line_3260'>  I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight</a>
<a id='line_3261'>  Which the new-comer carried through the waste                       85</a>
<a id='line_3262'>  Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone</a>
<a id='line_3263'>  (To give it in the language of the dream)</a>
<a id='line_3264'>  Was "Euclid's Elements;" and "This," said he,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>  "Is something of more worth;" and at the word</a>
<a id='line_3266'>  Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,                   90</a>
<a id='line_3267'>  In colour so resplendent, with command</a>
<a id='line_3268'>  That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,</a>
<a id='line_3269'>  And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,</a>
<a id='line_3270'>  Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,</a>
<a id='line_3271'>  A loud prophetic blast of harmony;                                  95</a>
<a id='line_3272'>  An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold</a>
<a id='line_3273'>  Destruction to the children of the earth</a>
<a id='line_3274'>  By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased</a>
<a id='line_3275'>  The song, than the Arab with calm look declared</a>
<a id='line_3276'>  That all would come to pass of which the voice                     100</a>
<a id='line_3277'>  Had given forewarning, and that he himself</a>
<a id='line_3278'>  Was going then to bury those two books:</a>
<a id='line_3279'>  The one that held acquaintance with the stars,</a>
<a id='line_3280'>  And wedded soul to soul in purest bond</a>
<a id='line_3281'>  Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;                           105</a>
<a id='line_3282'>  The other that was a god, yea many gods,</a>
<a id='line_3283'>  Had voices more than all the winds, with power</a>
<a id='line_3284'>  To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,</a>
<a id='line_3285'>  Through every clime, the heart of human kind.</a>
<a id='line_3286'>  While this was uttering, strange as it may seem,                   110</a>
<a id='line_3287'>  I wondered not, although I plainly saw</a>
<a id='line_3288'>  The one to be a stone, the other a shell;</a>
<a id='line_3289'>  Nor doubted once but that they both were books,</a>
<a id='line_3290'>  Having a perfect faith in all that passed.</a>
<a id='line_3291'>  Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt                          115</a>
<a id='line_3292'>  To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed</a>
<a id='line_3293'>  To share his enterprise, he hurried on</a>
<a id='line_3294'>  Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,</a>
<a id='line_3295'>  For oftentimes he cast a backward look,</a>
<a id='line_3296'>  Grasping his twofold treasure.--Lance in rest,                     120</a>
<a id='line_3297'>  He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now</a>
<a id='line_3298'>  He, to my fancy, had become the knight</a>
<a id='line_3299'>  Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,</a>
<a id='line_3300'>  But was an Arab of the desert too;</a>
<a id='line_3301'>  Of these was neither, and was both at once.                        125</a>
<a id='line_3302'>  His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;</a>
<a id='line_3303'>  And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_3304'>  Saw, over half the wilderness diffused,</a>
<a id='line_3305'>  A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:</a>
<a id='line_3306'>  "It is," said he, "the waters of the deep                          130</a>
<a id='line_3307'>  Gathering upon us;" quickening then the pace</a>
<a id='line_3308'>  Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,</a>
<a id='line_3309'>  He left me: I called after him aloud;</a>
<a id='line_3310'>  He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge</a>
<a id='line_3311'>  Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,                       135</a>
<a id='line_3312'>  Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,</a>
<a id='line_3313'>  With the fleet waters of a drowning world</a>
<a id='line_3314'>  In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,</a>
<a id='line_3315'>  And saw the sea before me, and the book,</a>
<a id='line_3316'>  In which I had been reading, at my side. [D]                       140</a>
<a id='line_3317'></a>
<a id='line_3318'>    Full often, taking from the world of sleep</a>
<a id='line_3319'>  This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,</a>
<a id='line_3320'>  This semi-Quixote, I to him have given</a>
<a id='line_3321'>  A substance, fancied him a living man,</a>

<a id='line_3450'>  Had no presumption, no such jealousy,</a>

<a id='line_3554'>  And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands                     370</a>

<a id='line_3560'>  Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,</a>

<a id='line_3565'>  Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung</a>
<a id='line_3566'>  Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise</a>

<a id='line_3582'>  Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies! [L]</a>
<a id='line_3583'>  Even now appears before the mind's clear eye</a>
<a id='line_3584'>  That self-same village church; I see her sit</a>

<a id='line_3586'>  On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy</a>
<a id='line_3587'>  Who slumbers at her feet,--forgetful, too,</a>
<a id='line_3588'>  Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,</a>
<a id='line_3589'>  And listening only to the gladsome sounds</a>
<a id='line_3590'>  That, from the rural school ascending, [M] play                    405</a>

<a id='line_3594'>  We might have fed upon a fatter soil</a>
<a id='line_3595'>  Of arts and letters--but be that forgiven)--410</a>
<a id='line_3596'>  A race of real children; not too wise,</a>
<a id='line_3597'>  Too learned, or too good; [N] but wanton, fresh,</a>
<a id='line_3598'>  And bandied up and down by love and hate;</a>
<a id='line_3599'>  Not unresentful where self-justified;</a>
<a id='line_3600'>  Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;                    415</a>
<a id='line_3601'>  Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;</a>
<a id='line_3602'>  Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft</a>
<a id='line_3603'>  Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight</a>
<a id='line_3604'>  Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not</a>
<a id='line_3605'>  In happiness to the happiest upon earth.                           420</a>
<a id='line_3606'>  Simplicity in habit, truth in speech,</a>
<a id='line_3607'>  Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;</a>
<a id='line_3608'>  May books and Nature be their early joy!</a>
<a id='line_3609'>  And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name--</a>
<a id='line_3610'>  Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!                      425</a>
<a id='line_3611'></a>
<a id='line_3612'>    Well do I call to mind the very week</a>
<a id='line_3613'>  When I was first intrusted to the care</a>
<a id='line_3614'>  Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,</a>
<a id='line_3615'>  And brooks [O] were like a dream of novelty</a>
<a id='line_3616'>  To my half-infant thoughts; that very week,                        430</a>
<a id='line_3617'>  While I was roving up and down alone,</a>
<a id='line_3618'>  Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross</a>
<a id='line_3619'>  One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,</a>
<a id='line_3620'>  Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:</a>
<a id='line_3621'>  Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom                      435</a>
<a id='line_3622'>  Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore</a>
<a id='line_3623'>  A heap of garments, as if left by one</a>
<a id='line_3624'>  Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched,</a>
<a id='line_3625'>  But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake</a>
<a id='line_3626'>  Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,                      440</a>
<a id='line_3627'>  And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped</a>
<a id='line_3628'>  The breathless stillness. [P] The succeeding day,</a>
<a id='line_3629'>  Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale</a>
<a id='line_3630'>  Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked</a>
<a id='line_3631'>  In passive expectation from the shore,                             445</a>
<a id='line_3632'>  While from a boat others hung o'er the deep,</a>
<a id='line_3633'>  Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.</a>
<a id='line_3634'>  At last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene</a>
<a id='line_3635'>  Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright</a>
<a id='line_3636'>  Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape                       450</a>
<a id='line_3637'>  Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,</a>
<a id='line_3638'>  Young as I was, a child not nine years old,</a>
<a id='line_3639'>  Possessed me, for my inner eye had seen</a>
<a id='line_3640'>  Such sights before, among the shining streams</a>
<a id='line_3641'>  Of faÃ«ry land, the forest of romance.                              455</a>
<a id='line_3642'>  Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle</a>
<a id='line_3643'>  With decoration of ideal grace;</a>
<a id='line_3644'>  A dignity, a smoothness, like the works</a>
<a id='line_3645'>  Of Grecian art, and purest poesy.</a>
<a id='line_3646'></a>
<a id='line_3647'>    A precious treasure had I long possessed,                        460</a>
<a id='line_3648'>  A little yellow, canvas-covered book,</a>
<a id='line_3649'>  A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;</a>
<a id='line_3650'>  And, from companions in a new abode,</a>
<a id='line_3651'>  When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine</a>
<a id='line_3652'>  Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry--465</a>
<a id='line_3653'>  That there were four large volumes, laden all</a>
<a id='line_3654'>  With kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,</a>
<a id='line_3655'>  A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,</a>
<a id='line_3656'>  With one not richer than myself, I made</a>
<a id='line_3657'>  A covenant that each should lay aside                              470</a>
<a id='line_3658'>  The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,</a>
<a id='line_3659'>  Till our joint savings had amassed enough</a>
<a id='line_3660'>  To make this book our own. Through several months,</a>
<a id='line_3661'>  In spite of all temptation, we preserved</a>
<a id='line_3662'>  Religiously that vow; but firmness failed,                         475</a>
<a id='line_3663'>  Nor were we ever masters of our wish.</a>
<a id='line_3664'></a>
<a id='line_3665'>    And when thereafter to my father's house</a>
<a id='line_3666'>  The holidays returned me, there to find</a>
<a id='line_3667'>  That golden store of books which I had left,</a>
<a id='line_3668'>  What joy was mine! How often in the course                         480</a>
<a id='line_3669'>  Of those glad respites, though a soft west wind</a>
<a id='line_3670'>  Ruffled the waters to the angler's wish</a>
<a id='line_3671'>  For a whole day together, have I lain</a>
<a id='line_3672'>  Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,</a>
<a id='line_3673'>  On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,                         485</a>
<a id='line_3674'>  And there have read, devouring as I read,</a>
<a id='line_3675'>  Defrauding the day's glory, desperate!</a>
<a id='line_3676'>  Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,</a>
<a id='line_3677'>  Such as an idler deals with in his shame,</a>
<a id='line_3678'>  I to the sport betook myself again.                                490</a>
<a id='line_3679'></a>
<a id='line_3680'>    A gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,</a>
<a id='line_3681'>  And o'er the heart of man: invisibly</a>
<a id='line_3682'>  It comes, to works of unreproved delight,</a>
<a id='line_3683'>  And tendency benign, directing those</a>
<a id='line_3684'>  Who care not, know not, think not what they do.                    495</a>
<a id='line_3685'>  The tales that charm away the wakeful night</a>
<a id='line_3686'>  In Araby, romances; legends penned</a>
<a id='line_3687'>  For solace by dim light of monkish lamps;</a>
<a id='line_3688'>  Fictions, for ladies of their love, devised</a>
<a id='line_3689'>  By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun                      500</a>
<a id='line_3690'>  By the dismantled warrior in old age,</a>
<a id='line_3691'>  Out of the bowels of those very schemes</a>
<a id='line_3692'>  In which his youth did first extravagate;</a>
<a id='line_3693'>  These spread like day, and something in the shape</a>
<a id='line_3694'>  Of these will live till man shall be no more.                      505</a>
<a id='line_3695'>  Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,</a>

<a id='line_3698'>  That hath more power than all the elements.</a>
<a id='line_3699'>  I guess not what this tells of Being past,                         510</a>

<a id='line_3708'>  Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,</a>

<a id='line_3736'></a>
<a id='line_3737'>                                   I am sad                          545</a>
<a id='line_3738'>  At thought of raptures now for ever flown; [R]</a>
<a id='line_3739'>  Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad</a>

<a id='line_3742'>  Did never fail to entrance me, and are now                         550</a>
<a id='line_3743'>  Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre</a>
<a id='line_3744'>  Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years</a>
<a id='line_3745'>  Or less I might have seen, when first my mind</a>
<a id='line_3746'>  With conscious pleasure opened to the charm</a>
<a id='line_3747'>  Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet                        555</a>
<a id='line_3748'>  For their own _sakes_, a passion, and a power;</a>
<a id='line_3749'>  And phrases pleased me chosen for delight,</a>
<a id='line_3750'>  For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roads</a>
<a id='line_3751'>  Yet unfrequented, while the morning light</a>
<a id='line_3752'>  Was yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad                         560</a>
<a id='line_3753'>  With a dear friend, [S] and for the better part</a>
<a id='line_3754'>  Of two delightful hours we strolled along</a>
<a id='line_3755'>  By the still borders of the misty lake, [T]</a>
<a id='line_3756'>  Repeating favourite verses with one voice,</a>
<a id='line_3757'>  Or conning more, as happy as the birds                             565</a>
<a id='line_3758'>  That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,</a>
<a id='line_3759'>  Lifted above the ground by airy fancies,</a>
<a id='line_3760'>  More bright than madness or the dreams of wine;</a>
<a id='line_3761'>  And, though full oft the objects of our love</a>
<a id='line_3762'>  Were false, and in their splendour overwrought, [U]                570</a>
<a id='line_3763'>  Yet was there surely then no vulgar power</a>
<a id='line_3764'>  Working within us,--nothing less, in truth,</a>
<a id='line_3765'>  Than that most noble attribute of man,</a>
<a id='line_3766'>  Though yet untutored and inordinate,</a>
<a id='line_3767'>  That wish for something loftier, more adorned,                     575</a>
<a id='line_3768'>  Than is the common aspect, daily garb,</a>
<a id='line_3769'>  Of human life. What wonder, then, if sounds</a>
<a id='line_3770'>  Of exultation echoed through the groves!</a>
<a id='line_3771'>  For, images, and sentiments, and words,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>  And everything encountered or pursued                              580</a>
<a id='line_3773'>  In that delicious world of poesy,</a>

<a id='line_3905'>    Of these was neither, and was both at once.'</a>
<a id='line_3906'></a>
<a id='line_3907'>  This is absolutely true, and was one of the earliest complaints made a</a>
<a id='line_3908'>  century and a half ago, when Spaniards began to criticise their one</a>
<a id='line_3909'>  great book. They could not tell at times whether Don Quixote was</a>

<a id='line_3912'>    'A bed of glittering light'</a>
<a id='line_3913'></a>
<a id='line_3914'>  is a delightful description of the attitude of Don Quixote's mind</a>

<a id='line_3916'></a>
<a id='line_3917'>    'It is,' said he, 'the waters of the deep</a>
<a id='line_3918'>    Gathering upon us.'</a>
<a id='line_3919'></a>
<a id='line_3920'>  "It was, of course, only the mirage; but this he changed to suit his</a>
<a id='line_3921'>  own purpose into the 'waters of the deep,' as he changed the row of</a>
<a id='line_3922'>  Castilian wind-mills into giants, and the roar of the fulling mills</a>
<a id='line_3923'>  into the din of war.</a>
<a id='line_3924'></a>
<a id='line_3925'>  "Wordsworth is now awake from his dream, but turning all he saw in it</a>
<a id='line_3926'>  into a reality, as only the poet can, he feels that</a>
<a id='line_3927'></a>
<a id='line_3928'>    'Reverence was due to a being thus employed;</a>
<a id='line_3929'>    And thought that, _in the blind and awful lair</a>
<a id='line_3930'>    Of such a madness, reason did lie couched._'</a>
<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>  Here again is a most profound description of the creation of</a>
<a id='line_3933'>  Cervantes. Don Quixote was mad, but his was a madness that proceeded</a>
<a id='line_3934'>  from that 'blind and awful lair,' a disordered stomach, rather than</a>
<a id='line_3935'>  from an injured brain. Had Don Quixote not forsaken the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_3936'>  the chase and early rising, if he had not taken to eating chestnuts at</a>
<a id='line_3937'>  night, cold spiced meat, together with onions and 'ollas podridas',</a>
<a id='line_3938'>  then proceeding to read exciting, unnatural tales of love and war, he</a>
<a id='line_3939'>  would not have gone mad.</a>
<a id='line_3940'></a>
<a id='line_3941'>  "But his reason only lay 'couched,' not overthrown. Only give him a</a>
<a id='line_3942'>  dose of the balsam of Fierabras, his reason shall spring out of its</a>
<a id='line_3943'>  lair, like a lion from out its hiding-place, as indeed it did; and you</a>
<a id='line_3944'>  then have that wonderful piece of rhetoric, which describes the army</a>
<a id='line_3945'>  of Alifanfaron in the eighteenth chapter, Part I.</a>

<a id='line_3971'>[Footnote F: Wordsworth's earliest teachers, before he was sent to</a>
<a id='line_3972'>Hawkshead School, were his mother and the Rev. Mr. Gilbanks at</a>
<a id='line_3973'>Cockermouth, and Mrs. Anne Birkett at Penrith. His mother and Dame</a>
<a id='line_3974'>Birkett taught him to read, and trained his infant memory. Mr. Gilbanks</a>
<a id='line_3975'>also gave him elementary instruction; while his father made him commit</a>
<a id='line_3976'>to memory portions of the English poets. At Hawkshead he read English</a>
<a id='line_3977'>literature, learned Latin and Mathematics, and wrote both English and</a>
<a id='line_3978'>Latin verse. There was little or no method, and no mechanical or</a>
<a id='line_3979'>artificial drill in his early education. Though he was taught both</a>
<a id='line_3980'>languages and mathematics he was left as free to range the "happy</a>
<a id='line_3981'>pastures" of literature, as to range the Hawkshead woods on autumn</a>
<a id='line_3982'>nights in pursuit of woodcocks. It is likely that the reference in the</a>
<a id='line_3983'>above passage is to his education both in childhood and in youth,</a>
<a id='line_3984'>although specially to the former. In his 'Autobiographical Memoranda',</a>
<a id='line_3985'>Wordsworth says,</a>
<a id='line_3986'></a>
<a id='line_3987'>  "Of my earliest days at School I have little to say, but that they</a>
<a id='line_3988'>  were very happy ones, chiefly because I was left at liberty, then and</a>
<a id='line_3989'>  in the vacations, to read whatever books I liked. For example, I read</a>
<a id='line_3990'>  all Fielding's works, 'Don Quixote',  'Gil Blas', and any part of</a>
<a id='line_3991'>  Swift that I liked; 'Gulliver's Travels' and the 'Tale of a Tub' being</a>

<a id='line_3994'>As Wordsworth alludes to Coleridge's education, along with his own, "in</a>

<a id='line_3996'>Coleridge's early time at the vicarage of Ottery St. Mary's, Devonshire,</a>
<a id='line_3997'>and at the Grammar School there, as well as at Christ's Hospital in</a>

<a id='line_4043'>time. The main school-room is on the ground floor. One small chamber on</a>
<a id='line_4044'>the first floor was used, in the end of last century, by the head</a>
<a id='line_4045'>master, as a private class-room, for teaching a few advanced pupils. In</a>
<a id='line_4046'>another is a small library, formed in part by the donations of the</a>
<a id='line_4047'>scholars; it having been a custom for each pupil to present a volume on</a>
<a id='line_4048'>leaving the school, or to send one afterwards. Very probably one of the</a>
<a id='line_4049'>volumes now in the library was presented by Wordsworth. There are</a>
<a id='line_4050'>several which were presented by his school-fellows, during the years in</a>
<a id='line_4051'>which Wordsworth was at Hawkshead. The master, in 1877, promised me that</a>
<a id='line_4052'>he would search through his somewhat musty treasures, to see if he could</a>
<a id='line_4053'>discover a book with the poet's autograph; but I never heard of his</a>
<a id='line_4054'>success. On the wall of the room containing the library is a tablet,</a>
<a id='line_4055'>recording the names of several masters. There also, in an old oak chest,</a>

<a id='line_4177'>  Internally from academic cares;</a>
<a id='line_4178'>  Yet independent study seemed a course</a>
<a id='line_4179'>  Of hardy disobedience toward friends</a>
<a id='line_4180'>  And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.</a>
<a id='line_4181'>  This spurious virtue, rather let it bear                            30</a>
<a id='line_4182'>  A name it now deserves, this cowardice,</a>
<a id='line_4183'>  Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love</a>
<a id='line_4184'>  Of freedom which encouraged me to turn</a>
<a id='line_4185'>  From regulations even of my own</a>
<a id='line_4186'>  As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell--35</a>
<a id='line_4187'>  Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then</a>
<a id='line_4188'>  And at a later season, or preserved;</a>
<a id='line_4189'>  What love of nature, what original strength</a>
<a id='line_4190'>  Of contemplation, what intuitive truths,</a>
<a id='line_4191'>  The deepest and the best, what keen research,                       40</a>
<a id='line_4192'>  Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?</a>
<a id='line_4193'></a>
<a id='line_4194'>  The Poet's soul was with me at that time;</a>
<a id='line_4195'>  Sweet meditations, the still overflow</a>
<a id='line_4196'>  Of present happiness, while future years</a>
<a id='line_4197'>  Lacked not anticipations, tender dreams,                            45</a>
<a id='line_4198'>  No few of which have since been realised;</a>
<a id='line_4199'>  And some remain, hopes for my future life.</a>
<a id='line_4200'>  Four years and thirty, told this very week, [D]</a>
<a id='line_4201'>  Have I been now a sojourner on earth,</a>
<a id='line_4202'>  By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me                                 50</a>
<a id='line_4203'>  Life's morning radiance hath not left the hills,</a>
<a id='line_4204'>  Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days</a>
<a id='line_4205'>  Which also first emboldened me to trust</a>
<a id='line_4206'>  With firmness, hitherto but lightly touched</a>
<a id='line_4207'>  By such a daring thought, that I might leave                        55</a>
<a id='line_4208'>  Some monument behind me which pure hearts</a>
<a id='line_4209'>  Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness,</a>
<a id='line_4210'>  Maintained even by the very name and thought</a>
<a id='line_4211'>  Of printed books and authorship, began</a>
<a id='line_4212'>  To melt away; and further, the dread awe                            60</a>
<a id='line_4213'>  Of mighty names was softened down and seemed</a>
<a id='line_4214'>  Approachable, admitting fellowship</a>
<a id='line_4215'>  Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now,</a>
<a id='line_4216'>  Though not familiarly, my mind put on,</a>
<a id='line_4217'>  Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.                       65</a>
<a id='line_4218'></a>
<a id='line_4219'>    All winter long, whenever free to choose,</a>
<a id='line_4220'>  Did I by night frequent the College groves</a>
<a id='line_4221'>  And tributary walks; the last, and oft</a>
<a id='line_4222'>  The only one, who had been lingering there</a>
<a id='line_4223'>  Through hours of silence, till the porter's bell,                   70</a>
<a id='line_4224'>  A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,</a>
<a id='line_4225'>  Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice,</a>
<a id='line_4226'>  Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,</a>
<a id='line_4227'>  Inviting shades of opportune recess,</a>
<a id='line_4228'>  Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood                               75</a>
<a id='line_4229'>  Unpeaceful in itself. A single tree</a>
<a id='line_4230'>  With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,</a>
<a id='line_4231'>  Grew there; [E] an ash which Winter for himself</a>
<a id='line_4232'>  Decked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:</a>
<a id='line_4233'>  Up from the ground, and almost to the top,                          80</a>
<a id='line_4234'>  The trunk and every master branch were green</a>
<a id='line_4235'>  With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs</a>
<a id='line_4236'>  And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds</a>
<a id='line_4237'>  That hung in yellow tassels, while the air</a>
<a id='line_4238'>  Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood                     85</a>
<a id='line_4239'>  Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree</a>
<a id='line_4240'>  Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere</a>
<a id='line_4241'>  Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance</a>
<a id='line_4242'>  May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self</a>
<a id='line_4243'>  Could have more tranquil visions in his youth,                      90</a>
<a id='line_4244'>  Or could more bright appearances create</a>
<a id='line_4245'>  Of human forms with superhuman powers,</a>
<a id='line_4246'>  Than I beheld loitering on calm clear nights</a>
<a id='line_4247'>  Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth.</a>
<a id='line_4248'></a>
<a id='line_4249'>    On the vague reading of a truant youth [F]                        95</a>

<a id='line_4253'>  And yet the books which then I valued most</a>

<a id='line_4260'>  I was a better judge of thoughts than words,</a>
<a id='line_4261'>  Misled in estimating words, not only</a>

<a id='line_4266'>  To carry meaning to the natural heart;</a>
<a id='line_4267'>  To tell us what is passion, what is truth,</a>
<a id='line_4268'>  What reason, what simplicity and sense.</a>
<a id='line_4269'></a>
<a id='line_4270'>    Yet may we not entirely overlook                                 115</a>
<a id='line_4271'>  The pleasure gathered from the rudiments</a>

<a id='line_4274'>  No farther than the threshold, [G] there I found</a>
<a id='line_4275'>  Both elevation and composed delight:                               120</a>
<a id='line_4276'>  With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleased</a>
<a id='line_4277'>  With its own struggles, did I meditate</a>
<a id='line_4278'>  On the relation those abstractions bear</a>

<a id='line_4280'>  Those immaterial agents bowed their heads                          125</a>
<a id='line_4281'>  Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;</a>
<a id='line_4282'>  From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,</a>
<a id='line_4283'>  From system on to system without end.</a>
<a id='line_4284'></a>
<a id='line_4285'>    More frequently from the same source I drew</a>
<a id='line_4286'>  A pleasure quiet and profound, a sense                             130</a>
<a id='line_4287'>  Of permanent and universal sway,</a>
<a id='line_4288'>  And paramount belief; there, recognised</a>
<a id='line_4289'>  A type, for finite natures, of the one</a>
<a id='line_4290'>  Supreme Existence, the surpassing life</a>
<a id='line_4291'>  Which--to the boundaries of space and time,                        135</a>
<a id='line_4292'>  Of melancholy space and doleful time,</a>
<a id='line_4293'>  Superior, and incapable of change,</a>

<a id='line_4296'>  And silence did await upon these thoughts                          140</a>

<a id='line_4302'>  To land a single volume, saved by chance,                          145</a>
<a id='line_4303'>  A treatise of Geometry, he wont,</a>
<a id='line_4304'>  Although of food and clothing destitute,</a>
<a id='line_4305'>  And beyond common wretchedness depressed,</a>
<a id='line_4306'>  To part from company and take this book</a>
<a id='line_4307'>  (Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)                     150</a>
<a id='line_4308'>  To spots remote, and draw his diagrams</a>
<a id='line_4309'>  With a long staff upon the sand, and thus</a>
<a id='line_4310'>  Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost</a>
<a id='line_4311'>  Forget his feeling: so (if like effect</a>

<a id='line_4316'>  Of those abstractions to a mind beset</a>
<a id='line_4317'>  With images, and haunted by herself,                               160</a>
<a id='line_4318'>  And specially delightful unto me</a>
<a id='line_4319'>  Was that clear synthesis built up aloft</a>
<a id='line_4320'>  So gracefully; even then when it appeared</a>
<a id='line_4321'>  Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy</a>
<a id='line_4322'>  To sense embodied: not the thing it is                             165</a>
<a id='line_4323'>  In verity, an independent world,</a>
<a id='line_4324'>  Created out of pure intelligence.</a>
<a id='line_4325'></a>
<a id='line_4326'>    Such dispositions then were mine unearned</a>
<a id='line_4327'>  By aught, I fear, of genuine desert--</a>
<a id='line_4328'>  Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.                 170</a>
<a id='line_4329'>  And not to leave the story of that time</a>
<a id='line_4330'>  Imperfect, with these habits must be joined,</a>
<a id='line_4331'>  Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that loved</a>
<a id='line_4332'>  A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,</a>
<a id='line_4333'>  The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring; [H]               175</a>
<a id='line_4334'>  A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice</a>
<a id='line_4335'>  And inclination mainly, and the mere</a>
<a id='line_4336'>  Redundancy of youth's contentedness.</a>
<a id='line_4337'>--To time thus spent, add multitudes of hours</a>

<a id='line_4439'>  When thou wert thither guided. [Z] From the heart</a>
<a id='line_4440'>  Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest,</a>
<a id='line_4441'>  And didst sit down in temperance and peace,                        280</a>
<a id='line_4442'>  A rigorous student. [a] What a stormy course</a>
<a id='line_4443'>  Then followed. [b] Oh! it is a pang that calls</a>
<a id='line_4444'>  For utterance, to think what easy change</a>
<a id='line_4445'>  Of circumstances might to thee have spared</a>
<a id='line_4446'>  A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,                         285</a>
<a id='line_4447'>  For ever withered. Through this retrospect</a>
<a id='line_4448'>  Of my collegiate life I still have had</a>
<a id='line_4449'>  Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place</a>
<a id='line_4450'>  Present before my eyes, have played with times</a>
<a id='line_4451'>  And accidents as children do with cards,                           290</a>
<a id='line_4452'>  Or as a man, who, when his house is built,</a>
<a id='line_4453'>  A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,</a>
<a id='line_4454'>  As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,</a>
<a id='line_4455'>  Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought</a>
<a id='line_4456'>  Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,                         295</a>
<a id='line_4457'>  And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,</a>
<a id='line_4458'>  Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse</a>
<a id='line_4459'>  Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms</a>
<a id='line_4460'>  Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out</a>
<a id='line_4461'>  From things well-matched or ill, and words for things,             300</a>
<a id='line_4462'>  The self-created sustenance of a mind</a>
<a id='line_4463'>  Debarred from Nature's living images,</a>
<a id='line_4464'>  Compelled to be a life unto herself,</a>
<a id='line_4465'>  And unrelentingly possessed by thirst</a>
<a id='line_4466'>  Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,                         305</a>
<a id='line_4467'>  Ah! surely not in singleness of heart</a>
<a id='line_4468'>  Should I have seen the light of evening fade</a>
<a id='line_4469'>  From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,</a>
<a id='line_4470'>  Even at that early time, needs must I trust</a>
<a id='line_4471'>  In the belief, that my maturer age,                                310</a>
<a id='line_4472'>  My calmer habits, and more steady voice,</a>
<a id='line_4473'>  Would with an influence benign have soothed,</a>
<a id='line_4474'>  Or chased away, the airy wretchedness</a>
<a id='line_4475'>  That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod</a>
<a id='line_4476'>  A march of glory, which doth put to shame                          315</a>
<a id='line_4477'>  These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else</a>
<a id='line_4478'>  Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought</a>
<a id='line_4479'>  That ever harboured in the breast of man.</a>
<a id='line_4480'></a>
<a id='line_4481'>    A passing word erewhile did lightly touch</a>
<a id='line_4482'>  On wanderings of my own, that now embraced                         320</a>
<a id='line_4483'>  With livelier hope a region wider far.</a>
<a id='line_4484'></a>
<a id='line_4485'>    When the third summer freed us from restraint,</a>
<a id='line_4486'>  A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer, [c]</a>
<a id='line_4487'>  Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,</a>
<a id='line_4488'>  And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,                     325</a>
<a id='line_4489'>  Bound to the distant Alps. [d] A hardy slight</a>
<a id='line_4490'>  Did this unprecedented course imply</a>
<a id='line_4491'>  Of college studies and their set rewards;</a>
<a id='line_4492'>  Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me</a>

<a id='line_4494'>  The censures, and ill-omening of those</a>
<a id='line_4495'>  To whom my worldly interests were dear.</a>
<a id='line_4496'>  But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>  And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,</a>
<a id='line_4498'>  Had given a charter to irregular hopes.                            335</a>
<a id='line_4499'>  In any age of uneventful calm</a>
<a id='line_4500'>  Among the nations, surely would my heart</a>
<a id='line_4501'>  Have been possessed by similar desire;</a>

<a id='line_4503'>  France standing on the top of golden hours, [e]                    340</a>
<a id='line_4504'>  And human nature seeming born again. [f]</a>
<a id='line_4505'></a>
<a id='line_4506'>    Lightly equipped, [g] and but a few brief looks</a>
<a id='line_4507'>  Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore</a>
<a id='line_4508'>  From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced</a>
<a id='line_4509'>  To land at Calais on the very eve                                  345</a>
<a id='line_4510'>  Of that great federal day; [h] and there we saw,</a>
<a id='line_4511'>  In a mean city, and among a few,</a>
<a id='line_4512'>  How bright a face is worn when joy of one</a>
<a id='line_4513'>  Is joy for tens of millions. [h] Southward thence</a>
<a id='line_4514'>  We held our way, direct through hamlets, towns, [i]                350</a>
<a id='line_4515'>  Gaudy with reliques of that festival,</a>
<a id='line_4516'>  Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,</a>
<a id='line_4517'>  And window-garlands. On the public roads,</a>
<a id='line_4518'>  And, once, three days successively, through paths</a>
<a id='line_4519'>  By which our toilsome journey was abridged, [k]                    355</a>
<a id='line_4520'>  Among sequestered villages we walked</a>
<a id='line_4521'>  And found benevolence and blessedness</a>
<a id='line_4522'>  Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring</a>
<a id='line_4523'>  Hath left no corner of the land untouched:</a>
<a id='line_4524'>  Where elms for many and many a league in files                     360</a>
<a id='line_4525'>  With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads</a>
<a id='line_4526'>  Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads, [m]</a>
<a id='line_4527'>  For ever near us as we paced along:</a>
<a id='line_4528'>  How sweet at such a time, with such delight</a>
<a id='line_4529'>  On every side, in prime of youthful strength,                      365</a>
<a id='line_4530'>  To feed a Poet's tender melancholy</a>
<a id='line_4531'>  And fond conceit of sadness, with the sound</a>

<a id='line_4533'>  The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,</a>
<a id='line_4534'>  Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw                           370</a>
<a id='line_4535'>  Dances of liberty, and, in late hours</a>
<a id='line_4536'>  Of darkness, dances in the open air</a>
<a id='line_4537'>  Deftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on</a>
<a id='line_4538'>  Might waste their breath in chiding.</a>
<a id='line_4539'>                                       Under hills--</a>
<a id='line_4540'>  The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,                        375</a>
<a id='line_4541'>  Upon the bosom of the gentle SaÃ´ne</a>
<a id='line_4542'>  We glided forward with the flowing stream, [n]</a>
<a id='line_4543'>  Swift Rhone! thou wert the _wings_ on which we cut</a>
<a id='line_4544'>  A winding passage with majestic ease</a>

<a id='line_4546'>  Those woods and farms and orchards did present</a>
<a id='line_4547'>  And single cottages and lurking towns,</a>
<a id='line_4548'>  Reach after reach, succession without end</a>
<a id='line_4549'>  Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair</a>
<a id='line_4550'>  Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along,                    385</a>
<a id='line_4551'>  Clustered together with a merry crowd</a>
<a id='line_4552'>  Of those emancipated, a blithe host</a>
<a id='line_4553'>  Of travellers, chiefly delegates returning</a>
<a id='line_4554'>  From the great spousals newly solemnised</a>
<a id='line_4555'>  At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.                       390</a>
<a id='line_4556'>  Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;</a>
<a id='line_4557'>  Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,</a>
<a id='line_4558'>  And with their swords flourished as if to fight</a>
<a id='line_4559'>  The saucy air. In this proud company</a>
<a id='line_4560'>  We landed--took with them our evening meal,                        395</a>
<a id='line_4561'>  Guests welcome almost as the angels were</a>
<a id='line_4562'>  To Abraham of old. The supper done,</a>
<a id='line_4563'>  With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts</a>
<a id='line_4564'>  We rose at signal given, and formed a ring</a>
<a id='line_4565'>  And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;               400</a>
<a id='line_4566'>  All hearts were open, every tongue was loud</a>
<a id='line_4567'>  With amity and glee; we bore a name</a>
<a id='line_4568'>  Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,</a>
<a id='line_4569'>  And hospitably did they give us hail,</a>
<a id='line_4570'>  As their forerunners in a glorious course;                         405</a>
<a id='line_4571'>  And round and round the board we danced again.</a>
<a id='line_4572'>  With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed</a>
<a id='line_4573'>  At early dawn. The monastery bells</a>
<a id='line_4574'>  Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;</a>
<a id='line_4575'>  The rapid river flowing without noise,                             410</a>
<a id='line_4576'>  And each uprising or receding spire</a>
<a id='line_4577'>  Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals</a>
<a id='line_4578'>  Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew</a>
<a id='line_4579'>  By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave</a>
<a id='line_4580'>  Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,                 415</a>
<a id='line_4581'>  Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued</a>
<a id='line_4582'>  Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set</a>
<a id='line_4583'>  Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there</a>
<a id='line_4584'>  Rested within an awful _solitude_: [p]</a>

<a id='line_4586'>  Of soul-affecting _solitude_ appeared</a>
<a id='line_4587'>  That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,</a>

<a id='line_4589'>  Arms flashing, and a military glare</a>
<a id='line_4590'>  Of riotous men commissioned to expel                               425</a>
<a id='line_4591'>  The blameless inmates, and belike subvert</a>
<a id='line_4592'>  That frame of social being, which so long</a>
<a id='line_4593'>  Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things</a>
<a id='line_4594'>  In silence visible and perpetual calm.</a>
<a id='line_4595'></a>
<a id='line_4596'>--"Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!"--The voice                 430</a>

<a id='line_4696'>  That had usurped upon a living thought</a>
<a id='line_4697'>  That never more could be. The wondrous Vale</a>
<a id='line_4698'>  Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon</a>
<a id='line_4699'>  With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,                        530</a>
<a id='line_4700'>  A motionless array of mighty waves,</a>
<a id='line_4701'>  Five rivers broad and vast, [z] made rich amends,</a>
<a id='line_4702'>  And reconciled us to realities;</a>
<a id='line_4703'>  There small birds warble from the leafy trees,</a>
<a id='line_4704'>  The eagle soars high in the element,                               535</a>
<a id='line_4705'>  There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,</a>
<a id='line_4706'>  The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,</a>
<a id='line_4707'>  While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,</a>
<a id='line_4708'>  Descending from the mountain to make sport</a>
<a id='line_4709'>  Among the cottages by beds of flowers.                             540</a>
<a id='line_4710'></a>
<a id='line_4711'>    Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,</a>
<a id='line_4712'>  Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state</a>
<a id='line_4713'>  Of intellect and heart. With such a book</a>
<a id='line_4714'>  Before our eyes, we could not choose but read</a>
<a id='line_4715'>  Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain                          545</a>
<a id='line_4716'>  And universal reason of mankind,</a>
<a id='line_4717'>  The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side</a>
<a id='line_4718'>  Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone</a>
<a id='line_4719'>  Each with his humour, could we fail to abound</a>
<a id='line_4720'>  In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:                        550</a>
<a id='line_4721'>  Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,</a>
<a id='line_4722'>  And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,</a>
<a id='line_4723'>  And sober posies of funereal flowers,</a>
<a id='line_4724'>  Gathered among those solitudes sublime</a>
<a id='line_4725'>  From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,                            555</a>
<a id='line_4726'>  Did sweeten many a meditative hour.</a>
<a id='line_4727'></a>
<a id='line_4728'>    Yet still in me with those soft luxuries</a>
<a id='line_4729'>  Mixed something of stem mood, an under-thirst</a>
<a id='line_4730'>  Of vigour seldom utterly allayed.</a>
<a id='line_4731'>  And from that source how different a sadness                       560</a>
<a id='line_4732'>  Would issue, let one incident make known.</a>
<a id='line_4733'>  When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb</a>
<a id='line_4734'>  Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, [Aa]</a>
<a id='line_4735'>  Following a band of muleteers, we reached</a>
<a id='line_4736'>  A halting-place, where all together took                           565</a>
<a id='line_4737'>  Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,</a>
<a id='line_4738'>  Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,</a>
<a id='line_4739'>  Then paced the beaten downward way that led</a>
<a id='line_4740'>  Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;</a>
<a id='line_4741'>  The only track now visible was one                                 570</a>
<a id='line_4742'>  That from the torrent's further brink held forth</a>
<a id='line_4743'>  Conspicuous invitation to ascend</a>
<a id='line_4744'>  A lofty mountain. After brief delay</a>
<a id='line_4745'>  Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,</a>
<a id='line_4746'>  And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears                       575</a>
<a id='line_4747'>  Intruded, for we failed to overtake</a>
<a id='line_4748'>  Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,</a>
<a id='line_4749'>  While every moment added doubt to doubt,</a>
<a id='line_4750'>  A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned</a>
<a id='line_4751'>  That to the spot which had perplexed us first                      580</a>
<a id='line_4752'>  We must descend, and there should find the road,</a>
<a id='line_4753'>  Which in the stony channel of the stream</a>
<a id='line_4754'>  Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;</a>
<a id='line_4755'>  And, that our future course, all plain to sight,</a>
<a id='line_4756'>  Was downwards, with the current of that stream.                    585</a>
<a id='line_4757'>  Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,</a>
<a id='line_4758'>  For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,</a>
<a id='line_4759'>  We questioned him again, and yet again;</a>
<a id='line_4760'>  But every word that from the peasant's lips</a>
<a id='line_4761'>  Came in reply, translated by our feelings,                         590</a>
<a id='line_4762'>  Ended in this,--'that we had crossed the Alps'.</a>
<a id='line_4763'></a>
<a id='line_4764'>    Imagination--here the Power so called</a>
<a id='line_4765'>  Through sad incompetence of human speech,</a>
<a id='line_4766'>  That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss</a>
<a id='line_4767'>  Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,                            595</a>
<a id='line_4768'>  At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;</a>
<a id='line_4769'>  Halted without an effort to break through;</a>
<a id='line_4770'>  But to my conscious soul I now can say--</a>
<a id='line_4771'>  "I recognise thy glory:" in such strength</a>
<a id='line_4772'>  Of usurpation, when the light of sense                             600</a>
<a id='line_4773'>  Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed</a>
<a id='line_4774'>  The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,</a>
<a id='line_4775'>  There harbours; whether we be young or old,</a>
<a id='line_4776'>  Our destiny, our being's heart and home,</a>
<a id='line_4777'>  Is with infinitude, and only there;                                605</a>
<a id='line_4778'>  With hope it is, hope that can never die,</a>
<a id='line_4779'>  Effort, and expectation, and desire,</a>
<a id='line_4780'>  And something evermore about to be.</a>
<a id='line_4781'>  Under such banners militant, the soul</a>
<a id='line_4782'>  Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils                     610</a>
<a id='line_4783'>  That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts</a>
<a id='line_4784'>  That are their own perfection and reward,</a>
<a id='line_4785'>  Strong in herself and in beatitude</a>
<a id='line_4786'>  That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile</a>
<a id='line_4787'>  Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds                         615</a>
<a id='line_4788'>  To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.</a>
<a id='line_4789'></a>
<a id='line_4790'>    The melancholy slackening that ensued</a>
<a id='line_4791'>  Upon those tidings by the peasant given</a>
<a id='line_4792'>  Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,</a>
<a id='line_4793'>  And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,                620</a>
<a id='line_4794'>  Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road [1]</a>
<a id='line_4795'>  Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait, [Bb]</a>
<a id='line_4796'>  And with them did we journey several hours</a>
<a id='line_4797'>  At a slow pace. [2] The immeasurable height</a>
<a id='line_4798'>  Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,                            625</a>
<a id='line_4799'>  The stationary blasts of waterfalls,</a>
<a id='line_4800'>  And in the narrow rent at every turn</a>
<a id='line_4801'>  Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_4802'>  The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,</a>
<a id='line_4803'>  The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,                       630</a>
<a id='line_4804'>  Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side</a>
<a id='line_4805'>  As if a voice were in them, the sick sight</a>
<a id='line_4806'>  And giddy prospect of the raving stream,</a>
<a id='line_4807'>  The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,</a>
<a id='line_4808'>  Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--635</a>
<a id='line_4809'>  Were all like workings of one mind, the features</a>
<a id='line_4810'>  Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;</a>
<a id='line_4811'>  Characters of the great Apocalypse,</a>
<a id='line_4812'>  The types and symbols of Eternity,</a>
<a id='line_4813'>  Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.                    640</a>
<a id='line_4814'></a>
<a id='line_4815'>    That night our lodging was a house that stood</a>
<a id='line_4816'>  Alone within the valley, at a point</a>
<a id='line_4817'>  Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelled</a>
<a id='line_4818'>  The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;</a>
<a id='line_4819'>  A dreary mansion, large beyond all need, [Cc]                      645</a>
<a id='line_4820'>  With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunned</a>
<a id='line_4821'>  By noise of waters, making innocent sleep</a>
<a id='line_4822'>  Lie melancholy among weary bones.</a>
<a id='line_4823'></a>
<a id='line_4824'>    Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,</a>
<a id='line_4825'>  Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified                          650</a>
<a id='line_4826'>  Into a lordly river, broad and deep,</a>
<a id='line_4827'>  Dimpling along in silent majesty,</a>
<a id='line_4828'>  With mountains for its neighbours, and in view</a>
<a id='line_4829'>  Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,</a>
<a id='line_4830'>  And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake, [Dd]                        655</a>
<a id='line_4831'>  Fit resting-place for such a visitant.</a>
<a id='line_4832'>  Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4833'>  How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,</a>
<a id='line_4834'>  Bask in the sunshine of the memory;</a>
<a id='line_4835'>  And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth                          660</a>
<a id='line_4836'>  Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth</a>
<a id='line_4837'>  Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake</a>
<a id='line_4838'>  Of thee, thy chestnut woods, [Ee] and garden plots</a>
<a id='line_4839'>  Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;</a>
<a id='line_4840'>  Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,                  665</a>
<a id='line_4841'>  Winding from house to house, from town to town,</a>
<a id='line_4842'>  Sole link that binds them to each other; [Ff] walks,</a>
<a id='line_4843'>  League after league, and cloistral avenues,</a>
<a id='line_4844'>  Where silence dwells if music be not there:</a>
<a id='line_4845'>  While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,                          670</a>
<a id='line_4846'>  Through fond ambition of that hour I strove</a>
<a id='line_4847'>  To chant your praise; [Gg] nor can approach you now</a>
<a id='line_4848'>  Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,</a>
<a id='line_4849'>  Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art</a>
<a id='line_4850'>  May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze                         675</a>
<a id='line_4851'>  Or sunbeam over your domain I passed</a>
<a id='line_4852'>  In motion without pause; but ye have left</a>
<a id='line_4853'>  Your beauty with me, a serene accord</a>
<a id='line_4854'>  Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed</a>
<a id='line_4855'>  In their submissiveness with power as sweet                        680</a>
<a id='line_4856'>  And gracious, almost might I dare to say,</a>
<a id='line_4857'>  As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,</a>
<a id='line_4858'>  Or the remembrance of a generous deed,</a>
<a id='line_4859'>  Or mildest visitations of pure thought,</a>
<a id='line_4860'>  When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked                         685</a>
<a id='line_4861'>  Religiously, in silent blessedness;</a>
<a id='line_4862'>  Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.</a>
<a id='line_4863'></a>
<a id='line_4864'>    With those delightful pathways we advanced,</a>
<a id='line_4865'>  For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,</a>
<a id='line_4866'>  That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed                       690</a>
<a id='line_4867'>  A character more stern. The second night,</a>
<a id='line_4868'>  From sleep awakened, and misled by sound</a>
<a id='line_4869'>  Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes</a>
<a id='line_4870'>  Whose import then we had not learned, we rose</a>
<a id='line_4871'>  By moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,                      695</a>
<a id='line_4872'>  And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,</a>
<a id='line_4873'>  Along the winding margin of the lake,</a>
<a id='line_4874'>  Led, as before, we should behold the scene</a>
<a id='line_4875'>  Hushed in profound repose. We left the town</a>
<a id='line_4876'>  Of Gravedona [Hh] with this hope; but soon                         700</a>
<a id='line_4877'>  Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,</a>
<a id='line_4878'>  And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.</a>
<a id='line_4879'>  An open place it was, and overlooked,</a>
<a id='line_4880'>  From high, the sullen water far beneath,</a>
<a id='line_4881'>  On which a dull red image of the moon                              705</a>
<a id='line_4882'>  Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form</a>
<a id='line_4883'>  Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour</a>
<a id='line_4884'>  We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night</a>
<a id='line_4885'>  Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock</a>
<a id='line_4886'>  At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,                    710</a>
<a id='line_4887'>  But _could not_ sleep, tormented by the stings</a>
<a id='line_4888'>  Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,</a>
<a id='line_4889'>  Filled all the woods; the cry of unknown birds;</a>
<a id='line_4890'>  The mountains more by blackness visible</a>
<a id='line_4891'>  And their own size, than any outward light;                        715</a>
<a id='line_4892'>  The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock</a>
<a id='line_4893'>  That told, with unintelligible voice,</a>
<a id='line_4894'>  The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,</a>
<a id='line_4895'>  And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,</a>
<a id='line_4896'>  That did not leave us free from personal fear;                     720</a>
<a id='line_4897'>  And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set</a>
<a id='line_4898'>  Before us, while she still was high in heaven;--</a>
<a id='line_4899'>  These were our food; and such a summer's night [Ii]</a>
<a id='line_4900'>  Followed that pair of golden days that shed</a>
<a id='line_4901'>  On Como's Lake, and all that round it lay,                         725</a>
<a id='line_4902'>  Their fairest, softest, happiest influence.</a>
<a id='line_4903'></a>
<a id='line_4904'>    But here I must break off, and bid farewell</a>
<a id='line_4905'>  To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught</a>
<a id='line_4906'>  With some untried adventure, in a course</a>
<a id='line_4907'>  Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow                        730</a>
<a id='line_4908'>  Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone</a>
<a id='line_4909'>  Be mentioned as a parting word, that not</a>
<a id='line_4910'>  In hollow exultation, dealing out</a>
<a id='line_4911'>  Hyperboles of praise comparative;</a>
<a id='line_4912'>  Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;                           735</a>
<a id='line_4913'>  Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind</a>
<a id='line_4914'>  Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner</a>
<a id='line_4915'>  On outward forms--did we in presence stand</a>
<a id='line_4916'>  Of that magnificent region. On the front</a>
<a id='line_4917'>  Of this whole Song is written that my heart                        740</a>
<a id='line_4918'>  Must, in such Temple, needs have offered up</a>
<a id='line_4919'>  A different worship. Finally, whate'er</a>
<a id='line_4920'>  I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream</a>
<a id='line_4921'>  That flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,</a>
<a id='line_4922'>  Confederate with the current of the soul,                          745</a>
<a id='line_4923'>  To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,</a>
<a id='line_4924'>  In its degree of power, administered</a>
<a id='line_4925'>  To grandeur or to tenderness,--to the one</a>
<a id='line_4926'>  Directly, but to tender thoughts by means</a>
<a id='line_4927'>  Less often instantaneous in effect;                                750</a>
<a id='line_4928'>  Led me to these by paths that, in the main,</a>
<a id='line_4929'>  Were more circuitous, but not less sure</a>
<a id='line_4930'>  Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_4931'></a>
<a id='line_4932'>    Oh, most belovÃ¨d Friend! a glorious time,</a>
<a id='line_4933'>  A happy time that was; triumphant looks                            755</a>
<a id='line_4934'>  Were then the common language of all eyes;</a>
<a id='line_4935'>  As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed</a>
<a id='line_4936'>  Their great expectancy: the fife of war</a>
<a id='line_4937'>  Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,</a>
<a id='line_4938'>  A black-bird's whistle in a budding grove.                         760</a>
<a id='line_4939'>  We left the Swiss exulting in the fate</a>
<a id='line_4940'>  Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast</a>
<a id='line_4941'>  Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,</a>
<a id='line_4942'>  We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret [Kk]</a>
<a id='line_4943'>  For battle in the cause of Liberty.                                765</a>
<a id='line_4944'>  A stripling, scarcely of the household then</a>
<a id='line_4945'>  Of social life, I looked upon these things</a>
<a id='line_4946'>  As from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,</a>
<a id='line_4947'>  Was touched, but with no intimate concern;</a>
<a id='line_4948'>  I seemed to move along them, as a bird                             770</a>
<a id='line_4949'>  Moves through the air, or as a fish pursues</a>
<a id='line_4950'>  Its sport, or feeds in its proper element;</a>
<a id='line_4951'>  I wanted not that joy, I did not need</a>
<a id='line_4952'>  Such help; the ever-living universe,</a>
<a id='line_4953'>  Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,                   775</a>
<a id='line_4954'>  And the independent spirit of pure youth</a>

<a id='line_5417'>  Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze</a>

<a id='line_5419'>  A glad preamble to this Verse: [B] I sang</a>
<a id='line_5420'>  Aloud, with fervour irresistible                                     5</a>
<a id='line_5421'>  Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,</a>
<a id='line_5422'>  From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side</a>
<a id='line_5423'>  To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth</a>
<a id='line_5424'>  (So willed the Muse) a less impetuous stream,</a>
<a id='line_5425'>  That flowed awhile with unabating strength,                         10</a>
<a id='line_5426'>  Then stopped for years; not audible again</a>
<a id='line_5427'>  Before last primrose-time, [C] Beloved Friend!</a>
<a id='line_5428'>  The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts</a>
<a id='line_5429'>  On thy departure to a foreign land [D]</a>
<a id='line_5430'>  Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.                     15</a>
<a id='line_5431'>  Through the whole summer have I been at rest, [E]</a>
<a id='line_5432'>  Partly from voluntary holiday,</a>
<a id='line_5433'>  And part through outward hindrance. But I heard,</a>
<a id='line_5434'>  After the hour of sunset yester-even,</a>
<a id='line_5435'>  Sitting within doors between light and dark,                        20</a>
<a id='line_5436'>  A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near</a>
<a id='line_5437'>  My threshold,--minstrels from the distant woods</a>
<a id='line_5438'>  Sent in on Winter's service, to announce,</a>
<a id='line_5439'>  With preparation artful and benign,</a>
<a id='line_5440'>  That the rough lord had left the surly North                        25</a>
<a id='line_5441'>  On his accustomed journey. The delight,</a>
<a id='line_5442'>  Due to this timely notice, unawares</a>
<a id='line_5443'>  Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,</a>
<a id='line_5444'>  "Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be</a>
<a id='line_5445'>  Associates, and, unscared by blustering winds,                      30</a>
<a id='line_5446'>  Will chant together." Thereafter, as the shades</a>
<a id='line_5447'>  Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied</a>
<a id='line_5448'>  A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume</a>
<a id='line_5449'>  Or canopy of yet unwithered fern,</a>
<a id='line_5450'>  Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen                           35</a>
<a id='line_5451'>  Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here</a>
<a id='line_5452'>  No less than sound had done before; the child</a>
<a id='line_5453'>  Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,</a>
<a id='line_5454'>  The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,</a>
<a id='line_5455'>  Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir                       40</a>
<a id='line_5456'>  Of Winter that had warbled at my door,</a>
<a id='line_5457'>  And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.</a>
<a id='line_5458'></a>
<a id='line_5459'>    The last night's genial feeling overflowed</a>
<a id='line_5460'>  Upon this morning, and my favourite grove,</a>
<a id='line_5461'>  Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft, [F]                      45</a>
<a id='line_5462'>  As if to make the strong wind visible,</a>
<a id='line_5463'>  Wakes in me agitations like its own,</a>
<a id='line_5464'>  A spirit friendly to the Poet's task,</a>
<a id='line_5465'>  Which we will now resume with lively hope,</a>
<a id='line_5466'>  Nor checked by aught of tamer argument                              50</a>
<a id='line_5467'>  That lies before us, needful to be told.</a>
<a id='line_5468'></a>
<a id='line_5469'>    Returned from that excursion, [G] soon I bade</a>
<a id='line_5470'>  Farewell for ever to the sheltered seats [H]</a>
<a id='line_5471'>  Of gownÃ¨d students, quitted hall and bower,</a>
<a id='line_5472'>  And every comfort of that privileged ground,                        55</a>
<a id='line_5473'>  Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among</a>
<a id='line_5474'>  The unfenced regions of society.</a>
<a id='line_5475'></a>
<a id='line_5476'>    Yet, undetermined to what course of life</a>
<a id='line_5477'>  I should adhere, and seeming to possess</a>

<a id='line_5479'>  At full command, to London first I turned, [I]</a>
<a id='line_5480'>  In no disturbance of excessive hope,</a>
<a id='line_5481'>  By personal ambition unenslaved,</a>
<a id='line_5482'>  Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,</a>
<a id='line_5483'>  From dangerous passions free. Three years had flown [K]             65</a>
<a id='line_5484'>  Since I had felt in heart and soul the shock</a>
<a id='line_5485'>  Of the huge town's first presence, and had paced</a>
<a id='line_5486'>  Her endless streets, a transient visitant: [K]</a>
<a id='line_5487'>  Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankind</a>
<a id='line_5488'>  Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly,                            70</a>
<a id='line_5489'>  And life and labour seem but one, I filled</a>
<a id='line_5490'>  An idler's place; an idler well content</a>
<a id='line_5491'>  To have a house (what matter for a home?)</a>
<a id='line_5492'>  That owned him; living cheerfully abroad</a>
<a id='line_5493'>  With unchecked fancy ever on the stir,                              75</a>
<a id='line_5494'>  And all my young affections out of doors.</a>
<a id='line_5495'></a>
<a id='line_5496'>    There was a time when whatsoe'er is feigned</a>

<a id='line_5503'>  Among Tartarian wilds--fell short, far short,</a>
<a id='line_5504'>  Of what my fond simplicity believed                                 85</a>
<a id='line_5505'>  And thought of London--held me by a chain</a>
<a id='line_5506'>  Less strong of wonder and obscure delight.</a>
<a id='line_5507'>  Whether the bolt of childhood's Fancy shot</a>
<a id='line_5508'>  For me beyond its ordinary mark,</a>
<a id='line_5509'>  'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys                        90</a>

<a id='line_5513'>  After short absence, curiously I scanned</a>

<a id='line_5515'>  From disappointment, not to find some change</a>
<a id='line_5516'>  In look and air, from that new region brought,</a>
<a id='line_5517'>  As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;</a>
<a id='line_5518'>  And every word he uttered, on my ears</a>
<a id='line_5519'>  Fell flatter than a cagÃ¨d parrot's note,                           100</a>
<a id='line_5520'>  That answers unexpectedly awry,</a>
<a id='line_5521'>  And mocks the prompter's listening. Marvellous things</a>

<a id='line_5524'>  In a Child's heart as fear itself) conceived                       105</a>
<a id='line_5525'>  For my enjoyment. Would that I could now</a>
<a id='line_5526'>  Recal what then I pictured to myself,</a>
<a id='line_5527'>  Of mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,</a>
<a id='line_5528'>  The King, and the King's Palace, and, not last,</a>
<a id='line_5529'>  Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned Lord Mayor:              110</a>
<a id='line_5530'>  Dreams not unlike to those which once begat</a>

<a id='line_5532'>  When he, a friendless and a drooping boy,</a>
<a id='line_5533'>  Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak out</a>
<a id='line_5534'>  Articulate music. [L] Above all, one thought                       115</a>
<a id='line_5535'>  Baffled my understanding: how men lived</a>
<a id='line_5536'>  Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still</a>
<a id='line_5537'>  Strangers, not knowing each the other's name.</a>
<a id='line_5538'></a>

<a id='line_5540'>  Licensed to take the meaning that we love!                         120</a>
<a id='line_5541'>  Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had heard</a>
<a id='line_5542'>  Of your green groves, [M] and wilderness of lamps</a>
<a id='line_5543'>  Dimming the stars, and fireworks magical,</a>

<a id='line_5724'>  I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn</a>
<a id='line_5725'>  From our own ground,--the Maid of Buttermere,--[T]</a>
<a id='line_5726'>  And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife</a>
<a id='line_5727'>  Deserted and deceived, the spoiler came</a>
<a id='line_5728'>  And wooed the artless daughter of the hills,                       300</a>
<a id='line_5729'>  And wedded her, in cruel mockery</a>
<a id='line_5730'>  Of love and marriage bonds. [U] These words to thee</a>
<a id='line_5731'>  Must needs bring back the moment when we first,</a>
<a id='line_5732'>  Ere the broad world rang with the maiden's name,</a>
<a id='line_5733'>  Beheld her serving at the cottage inn,                             305</a>
<a id='line_5734'>  Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,</a>
<a id='line_5735'>  With admiration of her modest mien</a>
<a id='line_5736'>  And carriage, marked by unexampled grace.</a>
<a id='line_5737'>  We since that time not unfamiliarly</a>
<a id='line_5738'>  Have seen her,--her discretion have observed,                      310</a>
<a id='line_5739'>  Her just opinions, delicate reserve,</a>
<a id='line_5740'>  Her patience, and humility of mind</a>
<a id='line_5741'>  Unspoiled by commendation and the excess</a>
<a id='line_5742'>  Of public notice--an offensive light</a>
<a id='line_5743'>  To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.                               315</a>
<a id='line_5744'></a>
<a id='line_5745'>    From this memorial tribute to my theme</a>
<a id='line_5746'>  I was returning, when, with sundry forms</a>
<a id='line_5747'>  Commingled--shapes which met me in the way</a>
<a id='line_5748'>  That we must tread--thy image rose again,</a>
<a id='line_5749'>  Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace                           320</a>
<a id='line_5750'>  Upon the spot where she was born and reared;</a>
<a id='line_5751'>  Without contamination doth she live</a>
<a id='line_5752'>  In quietness, without anxiety:</a>
<a id='line_5753'>  Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth</a>
<a id='line_5754'>  Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb                            325</a>
<a id='line_5755'>  That, thither driven from some unsheltered place,</a>
<a id='line_5756'>  Rests underneath the little rock-like pile</a>
<a id='line_5757'>  When storms are raging. Happy are they both--</a>
<a id='line_5758'>  Mother and child!--These feelings, in themselves</a>
<a id='line_5759'>  Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think                        330</a>
<a id='line_5760'>  On those ingenuous moments of our youth</a>
<a id='line_5761'>  Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes</a>
<a id='line_5762'>  And sorrows of the world. Those simple days</a>
<a id='line_5763'>  Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,</a>
<a id='line_5764'>  Which yet survive in memory, appears                               335</a>
<a id='line_5765'>  One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,</a>
<a id='line_5766'>  A sportive infant, who, for six months' space,</a>
<a id='line_5767'>  Not more, had been of age to deal about</a>
<a id='line_5768'>  Articulate prattle--Child as beautiful</a>
<a id='line_5769'>  As ever clung around a mother's neck,                              340</a>
<a id='line_5770'>  Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.</a>
<a id='line_5771'>  There, too, conspicuous for stature tall</a>
<a id='line_5772'>  And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood</a>
<a id='line_5773'>  The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,</a>
<a id='line_5774'>  False tints too well accorded with the glare                       345</a>
<a id='line_5775'>  From play-house lustres thrown without reserve</a>
<a id='line_5776'>  On every object near. The Boy had been</a>
<a id='line_5777'>  The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on</a>
<a id='line_5778'>  In whatsoever place, but seemed in this</a>
<a id='line_5779'>  A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.                         350</a>
<a id='line_5780'>  Of lusty vigour, more than infantine</a>
<a id='line_5781'>  He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose</a>
<a id='line_5782'>  Just three parts blown--a cottage-child--if e'er,</a>
<a id='line_5783'>  By cottage-door on breezy mountain side,</a>
<a id='line_5784'>  Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe                        355</a>
<a id='line_5785'>  By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board</a>
<a id='line_5786'>  Decked with refreshments had this child been placed,</a>
<a id='line_5787'>  _His_ little stage in the vast theatre,</a>
<a id='line_5788'>  And there he sate surrounded with a throng</a>
<a id='line_5789'>  Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men                        360</a>
<a id='line_5790'>  And shameless women, treated and caressed;</a>
<a id='line_5791'>  Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,</a>
<a id='line_5792'>  While oaths and laughter and indecent speech</a>
<a id='line_5793'>  Were rife about him as the songs of birds</a>
<a id='line_5794'>  Contending after showers. The mother now                           365</a>
<a id='line_5795'>  Is fading out of memory, but I see</a>
<a id='line_5796'>  The lovely Boy as I beheld him then</a>
<a id='line_5797'>  Among the wretched and the falsely gay,</a>
<a id='line_5798'>  Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged</a>
<a id='line_5799'>  Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells                          370</a>
<a id='line_5800'>  Muttered on black and spiteful instigation</a>
<a id='line_5801'>  Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.</a>
<a id='line_5802'>  Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer</a>
<a id='line_5803'>  Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked</a>
<a id='line_5804'>  By special privilege of Nature's love,                             375</a>
<a id='line_5805'>  Should in his childhood be detained for ever!</a>
<a id='line_5806'>  But with its universal freight the tide</a>
<a id='line_5807'>  Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent,</a>
<a id='line_5808'>  Mary! may now have lived till he could look</a>
<a id='line_5809'>  With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,                        380</a>
<a id='line_5810'>  Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed.</a>
<a id='line_5811'></a>
<a id='line_5812'>  Four rapid years had scarcely then been told [V]</a>
<a id='line_5813'>  Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,</a>
<a id='line_5814'>  I heard, and for the first time in my life,</a>
<a id='line_5815'>  The voice of woman utter blasphemy--385</a>
<a id='line_5816'>  Saw woman as she is, to open shame</a>
<a id='line_5817'>  Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;</a>
<a id='line_5818'>  I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once</a>
<a id='line_5819'>  Thrown in, that from humanity divorced</a>
<a id='line_5820'>  Humanity, splitting the race of man                                390</a>
<a id='line_5821'>  In twain, yet leaving the same outward form.</a>
<a id='line_5822'>  Distress of mind ensued upon the sight</a>
<a id='line_5823'>  And ardent meditation. Later years</a>
<a id='line_5824'>  Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness.</a>
<a id='line_5825'>  Feelings of pure commiseration, grief                              395</a>
<a id='line_5826'>  For the individual and the overthrow</a>
<a id='line_5827'>  Of her soul's beauty; farther I was then</a>
<a id='line_5828'>  But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth</a>
<a id='line_5829'>  The sorrow of the passion stopped me there.</a>
<a id='line_5830'></a>
<a id='line_5831'>  But let me now, less moved, in order take                          400</a>
<a id='line_5832'>  Our argument. Enough is said to show</a>
<a id='line_5833'>  How casual incidents of real life,</a>
<a id='line_5834'>  Observed where pastime only had been sought,</a>
<a id='line_5835'>  Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events</a>
<a id='line_5836'>  And measured passions of the stage, albeit                         405</a>
<a id='line_5837'>  By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.</a>
<a id='line_5838'>  Yet was the theatre my dear delight;</a>
<a id='line_5839'>  The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,</a>
<a id='line_5840'>  And all the mean upholstery of the place,</a>
<a id='line_5841'>  Wanted not animation, when the tide                                410</a>
<a id='line_5842'>  Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast</a>
<a id='line_5843'>  With the ever-shifting figures of the scene,</a>
<a id='line_5844'>  Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame</a>
<a id='line_5845'>  Advanced in radiance through a deep recess</a>
<a id='line_5846'>  Of thick entangled forest, like the moon                           415</a>
<a id='line_5847'>  Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced</a>
<a id='line_5848'>  With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state</a>
<a id='line_5849'>  Of the world's greatness, winding round with train</a>
<a id='line_5850'>  Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;</a>
<a id='line_5851'>  Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling                       420</a>
<a id='line_5852'>  His slender manacles; or romping girl</a>
<a id='line_5853'>  Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,</a>
<a id='line_5854'>  A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up</a>
<a id='line_5855'>  In all the tatters of infirmity</a>
<a id='line_5856'>  All loosely put together, hobbled in,                              425</a>
<a id='line_5857'>  Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,</a>
<a id='line_5858'>  From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them</a>
<a id='line_5859'>  Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout [W]</a>
<a id='line_5860'>  Of one so overloaded with his years.</a>
<a id='line_5861'>  But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,                    430</a>
<a id='line_5862'>  The antics striving to outstrip each other,</a>
<a id='line_5863'>  Were all received, the least of them not lost,</a>
<a id='line_5864'>  With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,</a>
<a id='line_5865'>  Between the show, and many-headed mass</a>
<a id='line_5866'>  Of the spectators, and each several nook                           435</a>
<a id='line_5867'>  Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly</a>
<a id='line_5868'>  And with what flashes, as it were, the mind</a>
<a id='line_5869'>  Turned this way--that way! sportive and alert</a>
<a id='line_5870'>  And watchful, as a kitten when at play,</a>
<a id='line_5871'>  While winds are eddying round her, among straws                    440</a>
<a id='line_5872'>  And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!</a>
<a id='line_5873'>  Romantic almost, looked at through a space,</a>
<a id='line_5874'>  How small, of intervening years! For then,</a>
<a id='line_5875'>  Though surely no mean progress had been made</a>
<a id='line_5876'>  In meditations holy and sublime,                                   445</a>
<a id='line_5877'>  Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss</a>
<a id='line_5878'>  Of novelty survived for scenes like these;</a>
<a id='line_5879'>  Enjoyment haply handed down from times</a>
<a id='line_5880'>  When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn</a>
<a id='line_5881'>  Tricked out for that proud use, if I perchance                     450</a>
<a id='line_5882'>  Caught, on a summer evening through a chink</a>
<a id='line_5883'>  In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse</a>
<a id='line_5884'>  Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was</a>
<a id='line_5885'>  Gladdened me more than if I had been led</a>
<a id='line_5886'>  Into a dazzling cavern of romance,                                 455</a>
<a id='line_5887'>  Crowded with Genii busy among works</a>
<a id='line_5888'>  Not to be looked at by the common sun.</a>
<a id='line_5889'></a>
<a id='line_5890'>  The matter that detains us now may seem,</a>
<a id='line_5891'>  To many, neither dignified enough</a>

<a id='line_5893'>  Who, looking inward, have observed the ties</a>
<a id='line_5894'>  That bind the perishable hours of life</a>
<a id='line_5895'>  Each to the other, and the curious props</a>
<a id='line_5896'>  By which the world of memory and thought</a>
<a id='line_5897'>  Exists and is sustained. More lofty themes,                        465</a>
<a id='line_5898'>  Such as at least do wear a prouder face,</a>
<a id='line_5899'>  Solicit our regard; but when I think</a>
<a id='line_5900'>  Of these, I feel the imaginative power</a>
<a id='line_5901'>  Languish within me; even then it slept,</a>
<a id='line_5902'>  When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart                      470</a>
<a id='line_5903'>  Was more than full; amid my sobs and tears</a>
<a id='line_5904'>  It slept, even in the pregnant season of youth.</a>
<a id='line_5905'>  For though I was most passionately moved</a>
<a id='line_5906'>  And yielded to all changes of the scene</a>
<a id='line_5907'>  With an obsequious promptness, yet the storm                       475</a>
<a id='line_5908'>  Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;</a>
<a id='line_5909'>  Save when realities of act and mien,</a>

<a id='line_5911'>  In harmony amid the Poet's world,</a>
<a id='line_5912'>  Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth                           480</a>
<a id='line_5913'>  By power of contrast, made me recognise,</a>
<a id='line_5914'>  As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,</a>
<a id='line_5915'>  And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,</a>
<a id='line_5916'>  When, having closed the mighty Shakespeare's page,</a>
<a id='line_5917'>  I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.                       485</a>

<a id='line_5919'>  Pass we from entertainments, that are such</a>
<a id='line_5920'>  Professedly, to others titled higher,</a>
<a id='line_5921'>  Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,</a>
<a id='line_5922'>  More near akin to those than names imply,--</a>

<a id='line_5927'>  When one among the prime of these rose up,--</a>
<a id='line_5928'>  One, of whose name from childhood we had heard                     495</a>
<a id='line_5929'>  Familiarly, a household term, like those,</a>
<a id='line_5930'>  The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old</a>

<a id='line_5943'>  Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,                             510</a>
<a id='line_5944'>  Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.</a>
<a id='line_5945'></a>
<a id='line_5946'>    Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced</a>

<a id='line_5948'>  Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,</a>
<a id='line_5949'>  Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,                       515</a>

<a id='line_5956'>  The younger brethren of the grove. But some--</a>
<a id='line_5957'>  While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,</a>
<a id='line_5958'>  Against all systems built on abstract rights,</a>
<a id='line_5959'>  Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims                               525</a>
<a id='line_5960'>  Of Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;</a>
<a id='line_5961'>  Declares the vital power of social ties</a>
<a id='line_5962'>  Endeared by Custom; and with high disdain,</a>

<a id='line_5969'>  With ominous change, which, night by night, provoked               535</a>
<a id='line_5970'>  Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;</a>
<a id='line_5971'>  But memorable moments intervened,</a>
<a id='line_5972'>  When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove's brain,</a>
<a id='line_5973'>  Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,</a>
<a id='line_5974'>  Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one                        540</a>
<a id='line_5975'>  In ancient story versed, whose breast had heaved</a>
<a id='line_5976'>  Under the weight of classic eloquence,</a>

<a id='line_5978'></a>
<a id='line_5979'>    Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail</a>
<a id='line_5980'>  To achieve its higher triumph. Not unfelt                          545</a>
<a id='line_5981'>  Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard</a>
<a id='line_5982'>  The awful truths delivered thence by tongues</a>
<a id='line_5983'>  Endowed with various power to search the soul;</a>
<a id='line_5984'>  Yet ostentation, domineering, oft</a>
<a id='line_5985'>  Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!--550</a>
<a id='line_5986'>  There have I seen a comely bachelor,</a>
<a id='line_5987'>  Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascend</a>
<a id='line_5988'>  His rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,</a>
<a id='line_5989'>  And, in a tone elaborately low</a>
<a id='line_5990'>  Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze                      555</a>
<a id='line_5991'>  A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,</a>
<a id='line_5992'>  From time to time, into an orifice</a>
<a id='line_5993'>  Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,</a>
<a id='line_5994'>  And only not invisible, again</a>
<a id='line_5995'>  Open it out, diffusing thence a smile                              560</a>
<a id='line_5996'>  Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.</a>
<a id='line_5997'>  Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,</a>
<a id='line_5998'>  Moses, and he who penned, the other day,</a>
<a id='line_5999'>  The Death of Abel, [Z] Shakespeare, and the Bard</a>
<a id='line_6000'>  Whose genius spangled o'er a gloomy theme                          565</a>

<a id='line_6005'>  To entwine the crook of eloquence that helped                      570</a>
<a id='line_6006'>  This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the plains,</a>
<a id='line_6007'>  To rule and guide his captivated flock.</a>

<a id='line_6010'>  Leaving a thousand others, that, in hall,</a>
<a id='line_6011'>  Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,                              575</a>
<a id='line_6012'>  In public room or private, park or street,</a>
<a id='line_6013'>  Each fondly reared on his own pedestal,</a>
<a id='line_6014'>  Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,</a>
<a id='line_6015'>  Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,</a>
<a id='line_6016'>  And all the strife of singularity,                                 580</a>
<a id='line_6017'>  Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense--</a>
<a id='line_6018'>  Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,</a>
<a id='line_6019'>  There is no end. Such candidates for regard,</a>
<a id='line_6020'>  Although well pleased to be where they were found,</a>
<a id='line_6021'>  I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,                           585</a>
<a id='line_6022'>  Nor made unto myself a secret boast</a>
<a id='line_6023'>  Of reading them with quick and curious eye;</a>
<a id='line_6024'>  But, as a common produce, things that are</a>
<a id='line_6025'>  To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them</a>
<a id='line_6026'>  Such willing note, as, on some errand bound                        590</a>
<a id='line_6027'>  That asks not speed, a Traveller might bestow</a>
<a id='line_6028'>  On sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,</a>
<a id='line_6029'>  Or daisies swarming through the fields of June.</a>
<a id='line_6030'></a>
<a id='line_6031'>    But foolishness and madness in parade,</a>
<a id='line_6032'>  Though most at home in this their dear domain,                     595</a>
<a id='line_6033'>  Are scattered everywhere, no rarities,</a>
<a id='line_6034'>  Even to the rudest novice of the Schools.</a>
<a id='line_6035'>  Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keep</a>
<a id='line_6036'>  In memory, those individual sights</a>
<a id='line_6037'>  Of courage, or integrity, or truth,                                600</a>
<a id='line_6038'>  Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,</a>
<a id='line_6039'>  Appeared more touching. One will I select;</a>
<a id='line_6040'>  A Father--for he bore that sacred name--</a>
<a id='line_6041'>  Him saw I, sitting in an open square,</a>
<a id='line_6042'>  Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,                              605</a>
<a id='line_6043'>  Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced</a>
<a id='line_6044'>  A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate</a>
<a id='line_6045'>  This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched</a>
<a id='line_6046'>  Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought</a>
<a id='line_6047'>  For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air.                      610</a>
<a id='line_6048'>  Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,</a>
<a id='line_6049'>  He took no heed; but in his brawny arms</a>
<a id='line_6050'>  (The Artificer was to the elbow bare,</a>
<a id='line_6051'>  And from his work this moment had been stolen)</a>
<a id='line_6052'>  He held the child, and, bending over it,                           615</a>
<a id='line_6053'>  As if he were afraid both of the sun</a>
<a id='line_6054'>  And of the air, which he had come to seek,</a>
<a id='line_6055'>  Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.</a>
<a id='line_6056'></a>
<a id='line_6057'>    As the black storm upon the mountain top</a>
<a id='line_6058'>  Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so                             620</a>
<a id='line_6059'>  That huge fermenting mass of human-kind</a>
<a id='line_6060'>  Serves as a solemn back-ground, or relief,</a>
<a id='line_6061'>  To single forms and objects, whence they draw,</a>
<a id='line_6062'>  For feeling and contemplative regard,</a>
<a id='line_6063'>  More than inherent liveliness and power.                           625</a>
<a id='line_6064'>  How oft, amid those overflowing streets,</a>
<a id='line_6065'>  Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said</a>
<a id='line_6066'>  Unto myself, "The face of every one</a>
<a id='line_6067'>  That passes by me is a mystery!"</a>
<a id='line_6068'>  Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed                  630</a>
<a id='line_6069'>  By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,</a>
<a id='line_6070'>  Until the shapes before my eyes became</a>
<a id='line_6071'>  A second-sight procession, such as glides</a>
<a id='line_6072'>  Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;</a>
<a id='line_6073'>  And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond                       635</a>
<a id='line_6074'>  The reach of common indication, lost</a>
<a id='line_6075'>  Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten</a>
<a id='line_6076'>  Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)</a>
<a id='line_6077'>  Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,</a>
<a id='line_6078'>  Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest                      640</a>
<a id='line_6079'>  Wearing a written paper, to explain</a>
<a id='line_6080'>  His story, whence he came, and who he was.</a>
<a id='line_6081'>  Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round</a>
<a id='line_6082'>  As with the might of waters; an apt type</a>
<a id='line_6083'>  This label seemed of the utmost we can know,                       645</a>
<a id='line_6084'>  Both of ourselves and of the universe;</a>
<a id='line_6085'>  And, on the shape of that unmoving man,</a>
<a id='line_6086'>  His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,</a>
<a id='line_6087'>  As if admonished from another world.</a>
<a id='line_6088'></a>
<a id='line_6089'>    Though reared upon the base of outward things,                   650</a>
<a id='line_6090'>  Structures like these the excited spirit mainly</a>
<a id='line_6091'>  Builds for herself; scenes different there are,</a>
<a id='line_6092'>  Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,</a>
<a id='line_6093'>  Possession of the faculties,--the peace</a>
<a id='line_6094'>  That comes with night; the deep solemnity                          655</a>
<a id='line_6095'>  Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,</a>
<a id='line_6096'>  When the great tide of human life stands still;</a>
<a id='line_6097'>  The business of the day to come, unborn,</a>
<a id='line_6098'>  Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;</a>
<a id='line_6099'>  The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,                     660</a>
<a id='line_6100'>  Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and sounds</a>
<a id='line_6101'>  Unfrequent as in deserts; at late hours</a>
<a id='line_6102'>  Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains</a>
<a id='line_6103'>  Are falling hard, with people yet astir,</a>

<a id='line_6410'>  What sounds are those, Helvellyn, that [1] are heard</a>
<a id='line_6411'>  Up to thy summit, through the depth of air</a>
<a id='line_6412'>  Ascending, as if distance had the power</a>
<a id='line_6413'>  To make the sounds more audible? What crowd</a>
<a id='line_6414'>  Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green? [2]                    5</a>
<a id='line_6415'>  Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee,</a>
<a id='line_6416'>  Though but a little family of men,</a>
<a id='line_6417'>  Shepherds and tillers of the ground--betimes</a>
<a id='line_6418'>  Assembled with their children and their wives,</a>
<a id='line_6419'>  And here and there a stranger interspersed.                         10</a>
<a id='line_6420'>  They hold a rustic fair--a festival,</a>
<a id='line_6421'>  Such as, on this side now, and now on that, [3]</a>
<a id='line_6422'>  Repeated through his tributary vales,</a>
<a id='line_6423'>  Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,</a>
<a id='line_6424'>  Sees annually, [A] if clouds towards either ocean                   15</a>
<a id='line_6425'>  Blown from their favourite resting-place, or mists</a>
<a id='line_6426'>  Dissolved, have left him [4] an unshrouded head.</a>
<a id='line_6427'>  Delightful day it is for all who dwell</a>
<a id='line_6428'>  In this secluded glen, and eagerly</a>
<a id='line_6429'>  They give it welcome. [5] Long ere heat of noon,                    20</a>
<a id='line_6430'>  From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep [6]</a>
<a id='line_6431'>  Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.</a>
<a id='line_6432'>  The heifer lows, uneasy at the voice</a>
<a id='line_6433'>  Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.</a>
<a id='line_6434'>  Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;                      25</a>
<a id='line_6435'>  A lame man or a blind, the one to beg,</a>
<a id='line_6436'>  The other to make music; hither, too,</a>
<a id='line_6437'>  From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,</a>
<a id='line_6438'>  Of hawker's wares--books, pictures, combs, and pins--</a>
<a id='line_6439'>  Some aged woman finds her way again,                                30</a>
<a id='line_6440'>  Year after year, a punctual visitant!</a>
<a id='line_6441'>  There also stands a speech-maker by rote,</a>
<a id='line_6442'>  Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show;</a>
<a id='line_6443'>  And in the lapse of many years may come [7]</a>
<a id='line_6444'>  Prouder itinerant, mountebank, or he                                35</a>
<a id='line_6445'>  Whose wonders in a covered wain lie hid.</a>
<a id='line_6446'>  But one there is, [8] the loveliest of them all,</a>
<a id='line_6447'>  Some sweet lass of the valley, looking out</a>
<a id='line_6448'>  For gains, and who that sees her would not buy?</a>
<a id='line_6449'>  Fruits of her father's orchard, are her wares,                      40</a>
<a id='line_6450'>  And with the ruddy produce, she walks round [9]</a>
<a id='line_6451'>  Among the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamed</a>
<a id='line_6452'>  Of her new office, [10] blushing restlessly.</a>
<a id='line_6453'>  The children now are rich, for the old to-day</a>
<a id='line_6454'>  Are generous as the young; and, if content                          45</a>
<a id='line_6455'>  With looking on, some ancient wedded pair</a>
<a id='line_6456'>  Sit in the shade together, while they gaze,</a>
<a id='line_6457'>  "A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,</a>
<a id='line_6458'>  The days departed start again to life,</a>
<a id='line_6459'>  And all the scenes of childhood reappear,                           50</a>
<a id='line_6460'>  Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun</a>
<a id='line_6461'>  To him who slept at noon and wakes at eve." [B]</a>
<a id='line_6462'>  Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,</a>
<a id='line_6463'>  Spreading from young to old, from old to young,</a>
<a id='line_6464'>  And no one seems to want his share.--Immense [11]                   55</a>
<a id='line_6465'>  Is the recess, the circumambient world</a>
<a id='line_6466'>  Magnificent, by which they are embraced:</a>
<a id='line_6467'>  They move about upon the soft green turf: [12]</a>

<a id='line_6469'>  And all that they can further or obstruct! [13]                     60</a>
<a id='line_6470'>  Through utter weakness pitiably dear,</a>
<a id='line_6471'>  As tender infants are: and yet how great!</a>
<a id='line_6472'>  For all things serve them: them the morning light</a>
<a id='line_6473'>  Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;</a>
<a id='line_6474'>  And them the silent rocks, which now from high                      65</a>
<a id='line_6475'>  Look down upon them; the reposing clouds;</a>
<a id='line_6476'>  The wild brooks prattling from [14] invisible haunts;</a>
<a id='line_6477'>  And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir</a>

<a id='line_6501'>  Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth</a>

<a id='line_6517'>  His comforts, native occupations, cares,</a>
<a id='line_6518'>  Cheerfully led to individual ends</a>
<a id='line_6519'>  Or social, and still followed by a train</a>
<a id='line_6520'>  Unwooed, unthought-of even--simplicity,</a>
<a id='line_6521'>  And beauty, and inevitable grace.                                  110</a>
<a id='line_6522'></a>
<a id='line_6523'>  Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowers</a>

<a id='line_6543'>  Left, even to us toiling in this late day,</a>
<a id='line_6544'>  A bright tradition of the golden age; [K]</a>
<a id='line_6545'>  Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses</a>
<a id='line_6546'>  Sequestered, handed down among themselves</a>
<a id='line_6547'>  Felicity, in Grecian song renowned; [L]                            135</a>
<a id='line_6548'>  Nor such as--when an adverse fate had driven,</a>

<a id='line_6558'>  Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far</a>
<a id='line_6559'>  Their May-bush [O], and along the streets in flocks</a>
<a id='line_6560'>  Parading with a song of taunting rhymes,</a>
<a id='line_6561'>  Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;</a>
<a id='line_6562'>  Had also heard, from those who yet remembered,                     150</a>
<a id='line_6563'>  Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked</a>
<a id='line_6564'>  Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; [O] and of youths,</a>
<a id='line_6565'>  Each with his maid, before the sun was up,</a>
<a id='line_6566'>  By annual custom, issuing forth in troops,</a>
<a id='line_6567'>  To drink the waters of some sainted well,                          155</a>
<a id='line_6568'>  And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;</a>
<a id='line_6569'>  But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:</a>
<a id='line_6570'>  The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped</a>

<a id='line_6573'>  Were the unluxuriant produce of a life</a>
<a id='line_6574'>  Intent on little but substantial needs,</a>
<a id='line_6575'>  Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.</a>
<a id='line_6576'>  But images of danger and distress,</a>
<a id='line_6577'>  Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms;                        165</a>
<a id='line_6578'>  Of this I heard, and saw enough to make</a>
<a id='line_6579'>  Imagination restless; nor was free</a>
<a id='line_6580'>  Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales</a>
<a id='line_6581'>  Wanting,--the tragedies of former times,</a>
<a id='line_6582'>  Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks                    170</a>
<a id='line_6583'>  Immutable and overflowing streams,</a>
<a id='line_6584'>  Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.</a>
<a id='line_6585'></a>
<a id='line_6586'>    Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,</a>
<a id='line_6587'>  Long springs and tepid winters, on the banks</a>

<a id='line_6589'>  Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores: [Q]</a>

<a id='line_6592'>  Devoted, on the inviolable stream</a>
<a id='line_6593'>  Of rich Clitumnus [R]; and the goat-herd lived                     180</a>
<a id='line_6594'>  As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows</a>
<a id='line_6595'>  Of cool Lucretilis [S], where the pipe was heard</a>
<a id='line_6596'>  Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks</a>

<a id='line_6602'>  There, for her own delight had Nature framed</a>
<a id='line_6603'>  A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse                         190</a>
<a id='line_6604'>  Of level pasture, islanded with groves</a>
<a id='line_6605'>  And banked with woody risings; but the Plain [T]</a>
<a id='line_6606'>  Endless, here opening widely out, and there</a>
<a id='line_6607'>  Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn</a>
<a id='line_6608'>  And intricate recesses, creek or bay                               195</a>
<a id='line_6609'>  Sheltered within a shelter, where at large</a>
<a id='line_6610'>  The shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home.</a>
<a id='line_6611'>  Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides</a>
<a id='line_6612'>  All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear</a>
<a id='line_6613'>  His flageolet to liquid notes of love                              200</a>
<a id='line_6614'>  Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far.</a>
<a id='line_6615'>  Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space</a>
<a id='line_6616'>  Where passage opens, but the same shall have</a>
<a id='line_6617'>  In turn its visitant, telling there his hours</a>
<a id='line_6618'>  In unlaborious pleasure, with no task                              205</a>
<a id='line_6619'>  More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl</a>
<a id='line_6620'>  For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds,</a>
<a id='line_6621'>  When through the region he pursues at will</a>
<a id='line_6622'>  His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life</a>
<a id='line_6623'>  I saw when, from the melancholy walls                              210</a>
<a id='line_6624'>  Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewed</a>
<a id='line_6625'>  My daily walk along that wide champaign, [U]</a>
<a id='line_6626'>  That, reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,</a>

<a id='line_6628'>  Of the Hercynian forest, [V] Yet, hail to you                      215</a>
<a id='line_6629'>  Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,</a>
<a id='line_6630'>  Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice, [W]</a>
<a id='line_6631'>  Powers of my native region! Ye that seize</a>
<a id='line_6632'>  The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams</a>
<a id='line_6633'>  Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds,                           220</a>
<a id='line_6634'>  That howl so dismally for him who treads</a>
<a id='line_6635'>  Companionless your awful solitudes!</a>
<a id='line_6636'>  There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long</a>
<a id='line_6637'>  To wait upon the storms: of their approach</a>
<a id='line_6638'>  Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives                         225</a>
<a id='line_6639'>  His flock, and thither from the homestead bears</a>
<a id='line_6640'>  A toilsome burden up the craggy ways,</a>
<a id='line_6641'>  And deals it out, their regular nourishment</a>
<a id='line_6642'>  Strewn on the frozen snow. And when the spring</a>
<a id='line_6643'>  Looks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs,                  230</a>
<a id='line_6644'>  And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs</a>
<a id='line_6645'>  Higher and higher, him his office leads</a>
<a id='line_6646'>  To watch their goings, whatsoever track</a>
<a id='line_6647'>  The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home</a>
<a id='line_6648'>  At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun                          235</a>
<a id='line_6649'>  Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat,</a>
<a id='line_6650'>  Than he lies down upon some shining rock,</a>
<a id='line_6651'>  And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,</a>
<a id='line_6652'>  As is their wont, a pittance from strict time,</a>
<a id='line_6653'>  For rest not needed or exchange of love,                           240</a>
<a id='line_6654'>  Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet</a>
<a id='line_6655'>  Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers</a>
<a id='line_6656'>  Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought</a>
<a id='line_6657'>  In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn</a>
<a id='line_6658'>  Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,                     245</a>
<a id='line_6659'>  His staff protending like a hunter's spear,</a>
<a id='line_6660'>  Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag,</a>
<a id='line_6661'>  And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams.</a>

<a id='line_6663'>  Might deign to follow him through what he does                     250</a>
<a id='line_6664'>  Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels,</a>
<a id='line_6665'>  In those vast regions where his service lies,</a>
<a id='line_6666'>  A freeman, wedded to his life of hope</a>
<a id='line_6667'>  And hazard, and hard labour interchanged</a>
<a id='line_6668'>  With that majestic indolence so dear                               255</a>
<a id='line_6669'>  To native man. A rambling school-boy, thus</a>
<a id='line_6670'>  I felt his presence in his own domain,</a>
<a id='line_6671'>  As of a lord and master, or a power,</a>
<a id='line_6672'>  Or genius, under Nature, under God,</a>
<a id='line_6673'>  Presiding; and severest solitude                                   260</a>
<a id='line_6674'>  Had more commanding looks when he was there.</a>
<a id='line_6675'>  When up the lonely brooks on rainy days</a>
<a id='line_6676'>  Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills</a>
<a id='line_6677'>  By mists bewildered, [X] suddenly mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_6678'>  Have glanced upon him distant a few steps,                         265</a>
<a id='line_6679'>  In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,</a>
<a id='line_6680'>  His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped</a>
<a id='line_6681'>  Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow,</a>
<a id='line_6682'>  His form hath flashed upon me, glorified</a>
<a id='line_6683'>  By the deep radiance of the setting sun:                           270</a>
<a id='line_6684'>  Or him have I descried in distant sky,</a>
<a id='line_6685'>  A solitary object and sublime,</a>
<a id='line_6686'>  Above all height! like an aerial cross</a>
<a id='line_6687'>  Stationed alone upon a spiry rock</a>
<a id='line_6688'>  Of the Chartreuse, for worship. [Y] Thus was man                   275</a>
<a id='line_6689'>  Ennobled outwardly before my sight,</a>
<a id='line_6690'>  And thus my heart was early introduced</a>
<a id='line_6691'>  To an unconscious love and reverence</a>
<a id='line_6692'>  Of human nature; hence the human form</a>
<a id='line_6693'>  To me became an index of delight,                                  280</a>
<a id='line_6694'>  Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.</a>
<a id='line_6695'>  Meanwhile this creature--spiritual almost</a>
<a id='line_6696'>  As those of books, but more exalted far;</a>
<a id='line_6697'>  Far more of an imaginative form</a>
<a id='line_6698'>  Than the gay Corin of the groves, [Z] who lives                    285</a>
<a id='line_6699'>  For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,</a>
<a id='line_6700'>  In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst--[Z]</a>
<a id='line_6701'>  Was, for the purposes of kind, a man</a>
<a id='line_6702'>  With the most common; husband, father; learned,</a>
<a id='line_6703'>  Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest                      290</a>
<a id='line_6704'>  From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;</a>
<a id='line_6705'>  Of this I little saw, cared less for it,</a>
<a id='line_6706'>  But something must have felt.</a>
<a id='line_6707'>                               Call ye these appearances</a>
<a id='line_6708'>  Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,</a>
<a id='line_6709'>  This sanctity of Nature given to man,                              295</a>
<a id='line_6710'>  A shadow, a delusion? ye who pore</a>
<a id='line_6711'>  On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;</a>
<a id='line_6712'>  Whose truth is not a motion or a shape</a>
<a id='line_6713'>  Instinct with vital functions, but a block</a>
<a id='line_6714'>  Or waxen image which yourselves have made,                         300</a>
<a id='line_6715'>  And ye adore! But blessed be the God</a>
<a id='line_6716'>  Of Nature and of Man that this was so;</a>
<a id='line_6717'>  That men before my inexperienced eyes</a>
<a id='line_6718'>  Did first present themselves thus purified,</a>
<a id='line_6719'>  Removed, and to a distance that was fit:                           305</a>
<a id='line_6720'>  And so we all of us in some degree</a>
<a id='line_6721'>  Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,</a>
<a id='line_6722'>  And howsoever; were it otherwise,</a>
<a id='line_6723'>  And we found evil fast as we find good</a>
<a id='line_6724'>  In our first years, or think that it is found,                     310</a>
<a id='line_6725'>  How could the innocent heart bear up and live!</a>
<a id='line_6726'>  But doubly fortunate my lot; not here</a>
<a id='line_6727'>  Alone, that something of a better life</a>
<a id='line_6728'>  Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege</a>
<a id='line_6729'>  Of most to move in, but that first I looked                        315</a>
<a id='line_6730'>  At Man through objects that were great or fair;</a>
<a id='line_6731'>  First communed with him by their help. And thus</a>
<a id='line_6732'>  Was founded a sure safeguard and defence</a>
<a id='line_6733'>  Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,</a>
<a id='line_6734'>  Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in                      320</a>
<a id='line_6735'>  On all sides from the ordinary world</a>
<a id='line_6736'>  In which we traffic. Starting from this point</a>
<a id='line_6737'>  I had my face turned toward the truth, began</a>
<a id='line_6738'>  With an advantage furnished by that kind</a>
<a id='line_6739'>  Of prepossession, without which the soul                           325</a>
<a id='line_6740'>  Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,</a>
<a id='line_6741'>  No genuine insight ever comes to her.</a>
<a id='line_6742'>  From the restraint of over-watchful eyes</a>
<a id='line_6743'>  Preserved, I moved about, year after year,</a>
<a id='line_6744'>  Happy, [a] and now most thankful that my walk                      330</a>
<a id='line_6745'>  Was guarded from too early intercourse</a>
<a id='line_6746'>  With the deformities of crowded life,</a>
<a id='line_6747'>  And those ensuing laughters and contempts,</a>
<a id='line_6748'>  Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think</a>
<a id='line_6749'>  With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord,                     335</a>
<a id='line_6750'>  Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_6751'>  Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,</a>
<a id='line_6752'>  That to devotion willingly would rise,</a>
<a id='line_6753'>  Into the temple and the temple's heart.</a>
<a id='line_6754'></a>
<a id='line_6755'>    Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me                    340</a>
<a id='line_6756'>  Thus early took a place pre-eminent;</a>
<a id='line_6757'>  Nature herself was, at this unripe time,</a>
<a id='line_6758'>  But secondary to my own pursuits</a>
<a id='line_6759'>  And animal activities, and all</a>
<a id='line_6760'>  Their trivial pleasures; [b] and when these had drooped            345</a>
<a id='line_6761'>  And gradually expired, and Nature, prized</a>
<a id='line_6762'>  For her own sake, became my joy, even then--[b]</a>
<a id='line_6763'>  And upwards through late youth, until not less</a>
<a id='line_6764'>  Than two-and-twenty summers had been told--[c]</a>
<a id='line_6765'>  Was Man in my affections and regards                               350</a>
<a id='line_6766'>  Subordinate to her, her visible forms</a>
<a id='line_6767'>  And viewless agencies: a passion, she,</a>
<a id='line_6768'>  A rapture often, and immediate love</a>
<a id='line_6769'>  Ever at hand; he, only a delight</a>
<a id='line_6770'>  Occasional, an accidental grace,                                   355</a>
<a id='line_6771'>  His hour being not yet come. Far less had then</a>
<a id='line_6772'>  The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned</a>
<a id='line_6773'>  My spirit to that gentleness of love</a>
<a id='line_6774'>  (Though they had long been carefully observed),</a>
<a id='line_6775'>  Won from me those minute obeisances                                360</a>
<a id='line_6776'>  Of tenderness, [d] which I may number now</a>
<a id='line_6777'>  With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these</a>
<a id='line_6778'>  The light of beauty did not fall in vain,</a>
<a id='line_6779'>  Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.</a>
<a id='line_6780'></a>
<a id='line_6781'>    But when that first poetic faculty                               365</a>
<a id='line_6782'>  Of plain Imagination and severe,</a>
<a id='line_6783'>  No longer a mute influence of the soul,</a>
<a id='line_6784'>  Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call,</a>
<a id='line_6785'>  To try her strength among harmonious words; [e]</a>
<a id='line_6786'>  And to book-notions and the rules of art                           370</a>
<a id='line_6787'>  Did knowingly conform itself; there came</a>
<a id='line_6788'>  Among the simple shapes of human life</a>
<a id='line_6789'>  A wilfulness of fancy and conceit; [e]</a>
<a id='line_6790'>  And Nature and her objects beautified</a>
<a id='line_6791'>  These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,                    375</a>
<a id='line_6792'>  They burnished her. From touch of this new power</a>
<a id='line_6793'>  Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew</a>
<a id='line_6794'>  Beside the well-known charnel-house had then</a>
<a id='line_6795'>  A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,</a>
<a id='line_6796'>  That took his station there for ornament:                          380</a>
<a id='line_6797'>  The dignities of plain occurrence then</a>
<a id='line_6798'>  Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point</a>
<a id='line_6799'>  Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.</a>
<a id='line_6800'>  Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow</a>
<a id='line_6801'>  Of her distress, was known to have turned her steps                385</a>
<a id='line_6802'>  To the cold grave in which her husband slept,</a>
<a id='line_6803'>  One night, or haply more than one, through pain</a>
<a id='line_6804'>  Or half-insensate impotence of mind,</a>
<a id='line_6805'>  The fact was caught at greedily, and there</a>
<a id='line_6806'>  She must be visitant the whole year through,                       390</a>
<a id='line_6807'>  Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.</a>
<a id='line_6808'></a>
<a id='line_6809'>    Through quaint obliquities I might pursue</a>
<a id='line_6810'>  These cravings; when the fox-glove, one by one,</a>
<a id='line_6811'>  Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,</a>
<a id='line_6812'>  Had shed beside the public way its bells,                          395</a>
<a id='line_6813'>  And stood of all dismantled, save the last</a>
<a id='line_6814'>  Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed</a>
<a id='line_6815'>  To bend as doth a slender blade of grass</a>
<a id='line_6816'>  Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,</a>
<a id='line_6817'>  Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still                     400</a>
<a id='line_6818'>  With this last relic, soon itself to fall,</a>
<a id='line_6819'>  Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,</a>
<a id='line_6820'>  All unconcerned by her dejected plight,</a>
<a id='line_6821'>  Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands</a>
<a id='line_6822'>  Gathered the purple cups that round them lay,                      405</a>
<a id='line_6823'>  Strewing the turf's green slope.</a>
<a id='line_6824'>                                  A diamond light</a>
<a id='line_6825'>  (Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote</a>
<a id='line_6826'>  A smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen</a>
<a id='line_6827'>  Sparkling from out a copse-clad bank that rose</a>
<a id='line_6828'>  Fronting our cottage. [f] Oft beside the hearth                    410</a>
<a id='line_6829'>  Seated, with open door, often and long</a>
<a id='line_6830'>  Upon this restless lustre have I gazed,</a>
<a id='line_6831'>  That made my fancy restless as itself.</a>
<a id='line_6832'>  'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield</a>
<a id='line_6833'>  Suspended over a knight's tomb, who lay                            415</a>
<a id='line_6834'>  Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood:</a>
<a id='line_6835'>  An entrance now into some magic cave</a>
<a id='line_6836'>  Or palace built by fairies of the rock;</a>
<a id='line_6837'>  Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant</a>
<a id='line_6838'>  The spectacle, by visiting the spot.                               420</a>
<a id='line_6839'>  Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,</a>
<a id='line_6840'>  Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bred</a>
<a id='line_6841'>  By pure Imagination: busy Power [g]</a>
<a id='line_6842'>  She was, and with her ready pupil turned</a>
<a id='line_6843'>  Instinctively to human passions, then                              425</a>
<a id='line_6844'>  Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm</a>
<a id='line_6845'>  Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich</a>
<a id='line_6846'>  As mine was through the bounty of a grand</a>
<a id='line_6847'>  And lovely region, [h] I had forms distinct</a>
<a id='line_6848'>  To steady me: each airy thought revolved                           430</a>
<a id='line_6849'>  Round a substantial centre, which at once</a>
<a id='line_6850'>  Incited it to motion, and controlled.</a>
<a id='line_6851'>  I did not pine like one in cities bred,</a>
<a id='line_6852'>  As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend! [i]</a>
<a id='line_6853'>  Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams                        435</a>
<a id='line_6854'>  Of sickliness, disjoining, joining, things</a>
<a id='line_6855'>  Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,</a>
<a id='line_6856'>  If, when the woodman languished with disease</a>
<a id='line_6857'>  Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground</a>
<a id='line_6858'>  Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,                           440</a>
<a id='line_6859'>  I called the pangs of disappointed love,</a>
<a id='line_6860'>  And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,</a>
<a id='line_6861'>  To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,</a>
<a id='line_6862'>  If not already from the woods retired</a>
<a id='line_6863'>  To die at home, was haply as I knew,                               445</a>
<a id='line_6864'>  Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,</a>
<a id='line_6865'>  Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful</a>
<a id='line_6866'>  On golden evenings, while the charcoal pile</a>
<a id='line_6867'>  Breathed up its smoke, an image of his ghost</a>
<a id='line_6868'>  Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.                     450</a>
<a id='line_6869'>  Nor shall we not be tending towards that point</a>
<a id='line_6870'>  Of sound humanity to which our Tale</a>
<a id='line_6871'>  Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I shew</a>
<a id='line_6872'>  How Fancy, in a season when she wove</a>
<a id='line_6873'>  Those slender cords, to guide the unconscious Boy                  455</a>
<a id='line_6874'>  For the Man's sake, could feed at Nature's call</a>
<a id='line_6875'>  Some pensive musings which might well beseem</a>
<a id='line_6876'>  Maturer years.</a>
<a id='line_6877'>                A grove there is whose boughs</a>
<a id='line_6878'>  Stretch from the western marge of Thurston-mere, [k]</a>
<a id='line_6879'>  With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides                   460</a>
<a id='line_6880'>  Along the line of low-roofed water, moves</a>
<a id='line_6881'>  As in a cloister. Once--while, in that shade</a>
<a id='line_6882'>  Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light</a>
<a id='line_6883'>  Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed</a>
<a id='line_6884'>  In silent beauty on the naked ridge                                465</a>
<a id='line_6885'>  Of a high eastern hill--thus flowed my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_6886'>  In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:</a>
<a id='line_6887'>  Dear native Regions, [m] wheresoe'er shall close</a>
<a id='line_6888'>  My mortal course, there will I think on you;</a>
<a id='line_6889'>  Dying, will cast on you a backward look;                           470</a>
<a id='line_6890'>  Even as this setting sun (albeit the Vale</a>
<a id='line_6891'>  Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)</a>
<a id='line_6892'>  Doth with the fond remains of his last power</a>
<a id='line_6893'>  Still linger, and a farewell lustre sheds</a>
<a id='line_6894'>  On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.                     475</a>
<a id='line_6895'></a>
<a id='line_6896'>  Enough of humble arguments; recal,</a>
<a id='line_6897'>  My Song! those high emotions which thy voice</a>
<a id='line_6898'>  Has heretofore made known; that bursting forth</a>
<a id='line_6899'>  Of sympathy, inspiring and inspired,</a>
<a id='line_6900'>  When everywhere a vital pulse was felt,                            480</a>
<a id='line_6901'>  And all the several frames of things, like stars,</a>
<a id='line_6902'>  Through every magnitude distinguishable,</a>
<a id='line_6903'>  Shone mutually indebted, or half lost</a>
<a id='line_6904'>  Each in the other's blaze, a galaxy</a>
<a id='line_6905'>  Of life and glory. In the midst stood Man,                         485</a>
<a id='line_6906'>  Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,</a>
<a id='line_6907'>  As, of all visible natures, crown, though born</a>
<a id='line_6908'>  Of dust, and kindred to the worm; a Being,</a>
<a id='line_6909'>  Both in perception and discernment, first</a>
<a id='line_6910'>  In every capability of rapture,                                    490</a>
<a id='line_6911'>  Through the divine effect of power and love;</a>
<a id='line_6912'>  As, more than anything we know, instinct</a>
<a id='line_6913'>  With godhead, and, by reason and by will,</a>
<a id='line_6914'>  Acknowledging dependency sublime.</a>
<a id='line_6915'></a>
<a id='line_6916'>  Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,                      495</a>
<a id='line_6917'>  Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapes</a>
<a id='line_6918'>  Of vice and folly thrust upon my view,</a>

<a id='line_6974'>  The threshold now is overpast, (how strange</a>

<a id='line_6976'>  Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),</a>
<a id='line_6977'>  A weight of ages did at once descend</a>
<a id='line_6978'>  Upon my heart; no thought embodied, no</a>
<a id='line_6979'>  Distinct remembrances, but weight and power,--</a>
<a id='line_6980'>  Power growing under weight: alas! I feel                           555</a>
<a id='line_6981'>  That I am trifling: 'twas a moment's pause,--</a>
<a id='line_6982'>  All that took place within me came and went</a>
<a id='line_6983'>  As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,</a>
<a id='line_6984'>  And grateful memory, as a thing divine.</a>
<a id='line_6985'></a>
<a id='line_6986'>  The curious traveller, who, from open day,                         560</a>
<a id='line_6987'>  Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,</a>
<a id='line_6988'>  The Grotto of Antiparos, [p] or the Den</a>
<a id='line_6989'>  In old time haunted by that Danish Witch,</a>
<a id='line_6990'>  Yordas; [q] he looks around and sees the vault</a>
<a id='line_6991'>  Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,                    565</a>
<a id='line_6992'>  Erelong, the massy roof above his head,</a>
<a id='line_6993'>  That instantly unsettles and recedes,--</a>
<a id='line_6994'>  Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all</a>
<a id='line_6995'>  Commingled, making up a canopy</a>
<a id='line_6996'>  Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape                        570</a>
<a id='line_6997'>  That shift and vanish, change and interchange</a>
<a id='line_6998'>  Like spectres,--ferment silent and sublime!</a>
<a id='line_6999'>  That after a short space works less and less,</a>
<a id='line_7000'>  Till, every effort, every motion gone,</a>
<a id='line_7001'>  The scene before him stands in perfect view                        575</a>
<a id='line_7002'>  Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!--</a>
<a id='line_7003'>  But let him pause awhile, and look again,</a>
<a id='line_7004'>  And a new quickening shall succeed, at first</a>
<a id='line_7005'>  Beginning timidly, then creeping fast,</a>
<a id='line_7006'>  Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass,                     580</a>
<a id='line_7007'>  Busies the eye with images and forms</a>
<a id='line_7008'>  Boldly assembled,--here is shadowed forth</a>
<a id='line_7009'>  From the projections, wrinkles, cavities,</a>
<a id='line_7010'>  A variegated landscape,--there the shape</a>
<a id='line_7011'>  Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail,                             585</a>
<a id='line_7012'>  The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk.</a>
<a id='line_7013'>  Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff:</a>
<a id='line_7014'>  Strange congregation! yet not slow to meet</a>
<a id='line_7015'>  Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.</a>
<a id='line_7016'></a>
<a id='line_7017'>    Even in such sort had I at first been moved,                     590</a>

<a id='line_7021'>  That great emporium, chronicle at once</a>

<a id='line_7030'>  Came, of themselves, or at her call derived</a>

<a id='line_7033'>  Capacious found, or seemed to find, in me                          605</a>
<a id='line_7034'>  A correspondent amplitude of mind;</a>
<a id='line_7035'>  Such is the strength and glory of our youth!</a>
<a id='line_7036'>  The human nature unto which I felt</a>
<a id='line_7037'>  That I belonged, and reverenced with love,</a>
<a id='line_7038'>  Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit                          610</a>
<a id='line_7039'>  Diffused through time and space, with aid derived</a>
<a id='line_7040'>  Of evidence from monuments, erect,</a>
<a id='line_7041'>  Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest</a>
<a id='line_7042'>  In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime</a>
<a id='line_7043'>  Of vanished nations, or more clearly drawn                         615</a>
<a id='line_7044'>  From books and what they picture and record.</a>
<a id='line_7045'></a>
<a id='line_7046'>    'Tis true, the history of our native land,</a>
<a id='line_7047'>  With those of Greece compared and popular Rome,</a>
<a id='line_7048'>  And in our high-wrought modern narratives</a>
<a id='line_7049'>  Stript of their harmonising soul, the life                         620</a>
<a id='line_7050'>  Of manners and familiar incidents,</a>
<a id='line_7051'>  Had never much delighted me. And less</a>
<a id='line_7052'>  Than other intellects had mine been used</a>
<a id='line_7053'>  To lean upon extrinsic circumstance</a>
<a id='line_7054'>  Of record or tradition; but a sense                                625</a>
<a id='line_7055'>  Of what in the Great City had been done</a>
<a id='line_7056'>  And suffered, and was doing, suffering, still,</a>
<a id='line_7057'>  Weighed with me, could support the test of thought;</a>
<a id='line_7058'>  And, in despite of all that had gone by,</a>
<a id='line_7059'>  Or was departing never to return,                                  630</a>
<a id='line_7060'>  There I conversed with majesty and power</a>
<a id='line_7061'>  Like independent natures. Hence the place</a>
<a id='line_7062'>  Was thronged with impregnations like the Wilds</a>
<a id='line_7063'>  In which my early feelings had been nursed--</a>
<a id='line_7064'>  Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns, rocks,                    635</a>
<a id='line_7065'>  And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,</a>
<a id='line_7066'>  Echoes and waterfalls, and pointed crags</a>
<a id='line_7067'>  That into music touch the passing wind.</a>
<a id='line_7068'>  Here then my young imagination found</a>
<a id='line_7069'>  No uncongenial element; could here                                 640</a>
<a id='line_7070'>  Among new objects serve or give command,</a>
<a id='line_7071'>  Even as the heart's occasions might require,</a>
<a id='line_7072'>  To forward reason's else too scrupulous march.</a>
<a id='line_7073'>  The effect was, still more elevated views</a>
<a id='line_7074'>  Of human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,                           645</a>
<a id='line_7075'>  Debasement undergone by body or mind,</a>
<a id='line_7076'>  Nor all the misery forced upon my sight,</a>
<a id='line_7077'>  Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scanned</a>
<a id='line_7078'>  Most feelingly, could overthrow my trust</a>
<a id='line_7079'>  In what we _may_ become; induce belief                             650</a>
<a id='line_7080'>  That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,</a>
<a id='line_7081'>  A solitary, who with vain conceits</a>
<a id='line_7082'>  Had been inspired, and walked about in dreams.</a>
<a id='line_7083'>  From those sad scenes when meditation turned,</a>
<a id='line_7084'>  Lo! every thing that was indeed divine                             655</a>
<a id='line_7085'>  Retained its purity inviolate,</a>
<a id='line_7086'>  Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloom</a>
<a id='line_7087'>  Set off; such opposition as aroused</a>
<a id='line_7088'>  The mind of Adam, yet in Paradise</a>

<a id='line_7093'>  Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.</a>
<a id='line_7094'>  Add also, that among the multitudes                                665</a>

<a id='line_7097'>  Is possible, the unity of man,</a>
<a id='line_7098'>  One spirit over ignorance and vice</a>
<a id='line_7099'>  Predominant, in good and evil hearts;                              670</a>
<a id='line_7100'>  One sense for moral judgments, as one eye</a>
<a id='line_7101'>  For the sun's light. The soul when smitten thus</a>
<a id='line_7102'>  By a sublime _idea_, whencesoe'er</a>
<a id='line_7103'>  Vouchsafed for union or communion, feeds</a>
<a id='line_7104'>  On the pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.                    675</a>
<a id='line_7105'>  Thus from a very early age, O Friend!</a>
<a id='line_7106'>  My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn</a>

<a id='line_7405'>[Footnote f: It is difficult to say where this "smooth rock wet with</a>

<a id='line_7407'>bank fronting Anne Tyson's cottage at Hawkshead. It may have been a rock</a>
<a id='line_7408'>on the wooded slope of the rounded hill that rises west of Cowper</a>
<a id='line_7409'>Ground, north-west of Hawkshead. A rock "wet with springs" existed</a>

<a id='line_7461'>The Fenwick note to this poem is as follows:</a>

<a id='line_7463'>  "The beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself</a>
<a id='line_7464'>  to me while I was resting in a boat along with my companions under the</a>

<a id='line_7466'>  branches from the shore of the promontory upon with stands the</a>
<a id='line_7467'>  ancient, and at that time the more picturesque, Hall of Coniston."</a>
<a id='line_7468'></a>
<a id='line_7469'>There is nothing in either poem definitely to connect "Thurstonmere"</a>
<a id='line_7470'>with Coniston, although their identity is suggested by the Fenwick note.</a>
<a id='line_7471'>I find, however, that Thurston was the ancient name of Coniston; and</a>
<a id='line_7472'>this carries us back to the time of the worship of Thor. (See Lewis's</a>

<a id='line_7548'>  With courage, and new hope risen on our toil</a>
<a id='line_7549'>  Fair greetings to this shapeless eagerness,</a>
<a id='line_7550'>  Whene'er it comes! needful in work so long,                         20</a>
<a id='line_7551'>  Thrice needful to the argument which now</a>
<a id='line_7552'>  Awaits us! Oh, how much unlike the past!</a>
<a id='line_7553'></a>
<a id='line_7554'>   Free as a colt at pasture on the hill,</a>
<a id='line_7555'>  I ranged at large, through London's wide domain,</a>
<a id='line_7556'>  Month after month [A]. Obscurely did I live,                        25</a>
<a id='line_7557'>  Not seeking frequent intercourse with men,</a>
<a id='line_7558'>  By literature, or elegance, or rank,</a>
<a id='line_7559'>  Distinguished. Scarcely was a year thus spent [A]</a>
<a id='line_7560'>  Ere I forsook the crowded solitude,</a>
<a id='line_7561'>  With less regret for its luxurious pomp,                            30</a>
<a id='line_7562'>  And all the nicely-guarded shows of art,</a>
<a id='line_7563'>  Than for the humble book-stalls in the streets,</a>
<a id='line_7564'>  Exposed to eye and hand where'er I turned.</a>
<a id='line_7565'></a>
<a id='line_7566'>    France lured me forth; the realm that I had crossed</a>
<a id='line_7567'>  So lately [B], journeying toward the snow-clad Alps.                35</a>
<a id='line_7568'>  But now, relinquishing the scrip and staff,</a>
<a id='line_7569'>  And all enjoyment which the summer sun</a>
<a id='line_7570'>  Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day</a>
<a id='line_7571'>  With motion constant as his own, I went</a>
<a id='line_7572'>  Prepared to sojourn in a pleasant town, [C]                         40</a>
<a id='line_7573'>  Washed by the current of the stately Loire.</a>
<a id='line_7574'></a>
<a id='line_7575'>    Through Paris lay my readiest course, and there</a>
<a id='line_7576'>  Sojourning a few days, I visited,</a>
<a id='line_7577'>  In haste, each spot of old or recent fame,</a>
<a id='line_7578'>  The latter chiefly; from the field of Mars                          45</a>
<a id='line_7579'>  Down to the suburbs of St. Antony,</a>
<a id='line_7580'>  And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome</a>
<a id='line_7581'>  Of GeneviÃ¨ve [D]. In both her clamorous Halls,</a>
<a id='line_7582'>  The National Synod and the Jacobins,</a>
<a id='line_7583'>  I saw the Revolutionary Power                                       50</a>
<a id='line_7584'>  Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms; [E]</a>
<a id='line_7585'>  The Arcades I traversed, in the Palace huge</a>
<a id='line_7586'>  Of OrlÃ©ans; [F] coasted round and round the line</a>
<a id='line_7587'>  Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop,</a>
<a id='line_7588'>  Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk                        55</a>
<a id='line_7589'>  Of all who had a purpose, or had not;</a>
<a id='line_7590'>  I stared and listened, with a stranger's ears,</a>
<a id='line_7591'>  To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild!</a>
<a id='line_7592'>  And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes,</a>
<a id='line_7593'>  In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look                           60</a>
<a id='line_7594'>  Hope takes, or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear,</a>
<a id='line_7595'>  But seemed there present; and I scanned them all,</a>
<a id='line_7596'>  Watched every gesture uncontrollable,</a>
<a id='line_7597'>  Of anger, and vexation, and despite,</a>
<a id='line_7598'>  All side by side, and struggling face to face,                      65</a>
<a id='line_7599'>  With gaiety and dissolute idleness.</a>
<a id='line_7600'></a>
<a id='line_7601'>    Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust</a>
<a id='line_7602'>  Of the Bastille, I sate in the open sun,</a>
<a id='line_7603'>  And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,</a>
<a id='line_7604'>  And pocketed the relic, [G] in the guise                            70</a>
<a id='line_7605'>  Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth,</a>
<a id='line_7606'>  I looked for something that I could not find,</a>
<a id='line_7607'>  Affecting more emotion than I felt;</a>
<a id='line_7608'>  For 'tis most certain, that these various sights,</a>
<a id='line_7609'>  However potent their first shock, with me                           75</a>
<a id='line_7610'>  Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains</a>
<a id='line_7611'>  Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun, [H]</a>
<a id='line_7612'>  A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hair</a>
<a id='line_7613'>  Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek</a>
<a id='line_7614'>  Pale and bedropped with everflowing tears.                          80</a>
<a id='line_7615'></a>
<a id='line_7616'>  But hence to my more permanent abode</a>
<a id='line_7617'>  I hasten; there, by novelties in speech,</a>
<a id='line_7618'>  Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,</a>
<a id='line_7619'>  And all the attire of ordinary life,</a>
<a id='line_7620'>  Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,                          85</a>
<a id='line_7621'>  I stood, 'mid those concussions, unconcerned,</a>
<a id='line_7622'>  Tranquil almost, and careless as a flower</a>
<a id='line_7623'>  Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub</a>
<a id='line_7624'>  That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,</a>
<a id='line_7625'>  While every bush and tree, the country through,                     90</a>
<a id='line_7626'>  Is shaking to the roots: indifference this</a>
<a id='line_7627'>  Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared</a>
<a id='line_7628'>  With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed</a>
<a id='line_7629'>  Into a theatre, whose stage was filled</a>
<a id='line_7630'>  And busy with an action far advanced.                               95</a>
<a id='line_7631'>  Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read</a>
<a id='line_7632'>  With care, the master pamphlets of the day;</a>
<a id='line_7633'>  Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild</a>
<a id='line_7634'>  Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk</a>
<a id='line_7635'>  And public news; but having never seen                             100</a>
<a id='line_7636'>  A chronicle that might suffice to show</a>
<a id='line_7637'>  Whence the main organs of the public power</a>
<a id='line_7638'>  Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how</a>
<a id='line_7639'>  Accomplished, giving thus unto events</a>
<a id='line_7640'>  A form and body; all things were to me                             105</a>
<a id='line_7641'>  Loose and disjointed, and the affections left</a>
<a id='line_7642'>  Without a vital interest. At that time,</a>
<a id='line_7643'>  Moreover, the first storm was overblown,</a>
<a id='line_7644'>  And the strong hand of outward violence</a>
<a id='line_7645'>  Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear                             110</a>
<a id='line_7646'>  Now in connection with so great a theme</a>
<a id='line_7647'>  To speak (as I must be compelled to do)</a>
<a id='line_7648'>  Of one so unimportant; night by night</a>
<a id='line_7649'>  Did I frequent the formal haunts of men,</a>
<a id='line_7650'>  Whom, in the city, privilege of birth                              115</a>
<a id='line_7651'>  Sequestered from the rest, societies</a>
<a id='line_7652'>  Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;</a>
<a id='line_7653'>  Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse</a>
<a id='line_7654'>  Of good and evil of the time was shunned</a>
<a id='line_7655'>  With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon                  120</a>
<a id='line_7656'>  Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew</a>
<a id='line_7657'>  Into a noisier world, and thus ere long</a>
<a id='line_7658'>  Became a patriot; and my heart was all</a>
<a id='line_7659'>  Given to the people, and my love was theirs.</a>
<a id='line_7660'></a>
<a id='line_7661'>  A band of military Officers,                                       125</a>
<a id='line_7662'>  Then stationed in the city, were the chief</a>
<a id='line_7663'>  Of my associates: some of these wore swords</a>
<a id='line_7664'>  That had been seasoned in the wars, and all</a>
<a id='line_7665'>  Were men well-born; the chivalry of France.</a>
<a id='line_7666'>  In age and temper differing, they had yet                          130</a>
<a id='line_7667'>  One spirit ruling in each heart; alike</a>
<a id='line_7668'>  (Save only one, hereafter to be named) [I]</a>
<a id='line_7669'>  Were bent upon undoing what was done:</a>
<a id='line_7670'>  This was their rest and only hope; therewith</a>
<a id='line_7671'>  No fear had they of bad becoming worse,                            135</a>
<a id='line_7672'>  For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,</a>
<a id='line_7673'>  Or deemed it worth a moment's thought to stir,</a>
<a id='line_7674'>  In any thing, save only as the act</a>
<a id='line_7675'>  Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,</a>
<a id='line_7676'>  Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile                          140</a>
<a id='line_7677'>  He had sate lord in many tender hearts;</a>
<a id='line_7678'>  Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:</a>
<a id='line_7679'>  His temper was quite mastered by the times,</a>
<a id='line_7680'>  And they had blighted him, had eaten away</a>
<a id='line_7681'>  The beauty of his person, doing wrong                              145</a>
<a id='line_7682'>  Alike to body and to mind: his port,</a>
<a id='line_7683'>  Which once had been erect and open, now</a>
<a id='line_7684'>  Was stooping and contracted, and a face,</a>
<a id='line_7685'>  Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts</a>
<a id='line_7686'>  Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed,                        150</a>
<a id='line_7687'>  As much as any that was ever seen,</a>
<a id='line_7688'>  A ravage out of season, made by thoughts</a>
<a id='line_7689'>  Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,</a>
<a id='line_7690'>  That from the press of Paris duly brought</a>
<a id='line_7691'>  Its freight of public news, the fever came,                        155</a>
<a id='line_7692'>  A punctual visitant, to shake this man,</a>
<a id='line_7693'>  Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek</a>
<a id='line_7694'>  Into a thousand colours; while he read,</a>
<a id='line_7695'>  Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch</a>
<a id='line_7696'>  Continually, like an uneasy place                                  160</a>
<a id='line_7697'>  In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour</a>
<a id='line_7698'>  Of universal ferment; mildest men</a>
<a id='line_7699'>  Were agitated; and commotions, strife</a>
<a id='line_7700'>  Of passion and opinion, filled the walls</a>
<a id='line_7701'>  Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.                            165</a>
<a id='line_7702'>  The soil of common life, was, at that time,</a>
<a id='line_7703'>  Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,</a>
<a id='line_7704'>  And not then only, "What a mockery this</a>
<a id='line_7705'>  Of history, the past and that to come!</a>
<a id='line_7706'>  Now do I feel how all men are deceived,                            170</a>
<a id='line_7707'>  Reading of nations and their works, in faith,</a>
<a id='line_7708'>  Faith given to vanity and emptiness;</a>
<a id='line_7709'>  Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect</a>
<a id='line_7710'>  To future times the face of what now is!"</a>
<a id='line_7711'>  The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain                    175</a>
<a id='line_7712'>  Devoured by locusts,--Carra, Gorsas,--add</a>
<a id='line_7713'>  A hundred other names, forgotten now, [K]</a>
<a id='line_7714'>  Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,</a>
<a id='line_7715'>  Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,</a>
<a id='line_7716'>  And felt through every nook of town and field.                     180</a>
<a id='line_7717'></a>
<a id='line_7718'>  Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chief</a>
<a id='line_7719'>  Of my associates stood prepared for flight</a>
<a id='line_7720'>  To augment the band of emigrants in arms [L]</a>
<a id='line_7721'>  Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued</a>
<a id='line_7722'>  With foreign foes mustered for instant war.                        185</a>
<a id='line_7723'>  This was their undisguised intent, and they</a>
<a id='line_7724'>  Were waiting with the whole of their desires</a>
<a id='line_7725'>  The moment to depart.</a>
<a id='line_7726'>                       An Englishman,</a>
<a id='line_7727'>  Born in a land whose very name appeared</a>
<a id='line_7728'>  To license some unruliness of mind;                                190</a>
<a id='line_7729'>  A stranger, with youth's further privilege,</a>
<a id='line_7730'>  And the indulgence that a half-learnt speech</a>
<a id='line_7731'>  Wins from the courteous; I, who had been else</a>
<a id='line_7732'>  Shunned and not tolerated, freely lived</a>
<a id='line_7733'>  With these defenders of the Crown, and talked,                     195</a>
<a id='line_7734'>  And heard their notions; nor did they disdain</a>
<a id='line_7735'>  The wish to bring me over to their cause.</a>
<a id='line_7736'></a>
<a id='line_7737'>    But though untaught by thinking or by books</a>
<a id='line_7738'>  To reason well of polity or law,</a>
<a id='line_7739'>  And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,                       200</a>
<a id='line_7740'>  Of natural rights and civil; and to acts</a>
<a id='line_7741'>  Of nations and their passing interests,</a>
<a id='line_7742'>  (If with unworldly ends and aims compared)</a>
<a id='line_7743'>  Almost indifferent, even the historian's tale</a>
<a id='line_7744'>  Prizing but little otherwise than I prized                         205</a>
<a id='line_7745'>  Tales of the poets, as it made the heart</a>
<a id='line_7746'>  Beat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,</a>
<a id='line_7747'>  Old heroes and their sufferings and their deeds;</a>
<a id='line_7748'>  Yet in the regal sceptre, and the pomp</a>
<a id='line_7749'>  Of orders and degrees, I nothing found                             210</a>
<a id='line_7750'>  Then, or had ever, even in crudest youth,</a>
<a id='line_7751'>  That dazzled me, but rather what I mourned</a>
<a id='line_7752'>  And ill could brook, beholding that the best</a>
<a id='line_7753'>  Ruled not, and feeling that they ought to rule.</a>
<a id='line_7754'></a>
<a id='line_7755'>    For, born in a poor district, and which yet                      215</a>
<a id='line_7756'>  Retaineth more of ancient homeliness,</a>
<a id='line_7757'>  Than any other nook of English ground,</a>
<a id='line_7758'>  It was my fortune scarcely to have seen,</a>
<a id='line_7759'>  Through the whole tenor of my school-day time,</a>
<a id='line_7760'>  The face of one, who, whether boy or man,                          220</a>
<a id='line_7761'>  Was vested with attention or respect</a>
<a id='line_7762'>  Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it least</a>
<a id='line_7763'>  Of many benefits, in later years</a>
<a id='line_7764'>  Derived from academic institutes</a>
<a id='line_7765'>  And rules, that they held something up to view                     225</a>
<a id='line_7766'>  Of a Republic, where all stood thus far</a>
<a id='line_7767'>  Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all</a>
<a id='line_7768'>  In honour, as in one community,</a>
<a id='line_7769'>  Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,</a>
<a id='line_7770'>  Distinction open lay to all that came,                             230</a>
<a id='line_7771'>  And wealth and titles were in less esteem</a>
<a id='line_7772'>  Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry.</a>
<a id='line_7773'>  Add unto this, subservience from the first</a>
<a id='line_7774'>  To presences of God's mysterious power</a>
<a id='line_7775'>  Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty,                             235</a>
<a id='line_7776'>  And fellowship with venerable books,</a>
<a id='line_7777'>  To sanction the proud workings of the soul,</a>
<a id='line_7778'>  And mountain liberty. It could not be</a>
<a id='line_7779'>  But that one tutored thus should look with awe</a>
<a id='line_7780'>  Upon the faculties of man, receive                                 240</a>
<a id='line_7781'>  Gladly the highest promises, and hail,</a>
<a id='line_7782'>  As best, the government of equal rights</a>
<a id='line_7783'>  And individual worth. And hence, O Friend!</a>
<a id='line_7784'>  If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced</a>
<a id='line_7785'>  Less than might well befit my youth, the cause                     245</a>
<a id='line_7786'>  In part lay here, that unto me the events</a>
<a id='line_7787'>  Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course,</a>
<a id='line_7788'>  A gift that was come rather late than soon.</a>
<a id='line_7789'>  No wonder, then, if advocates like these,</a>
<a id='line_7790'>  Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,                         250</a>
<a id='line_7791'>  And stung with injury, at this riper day,</a>
<a id='line_7792'>  Were impotent to make my hopes put on</a>
<a id='line_7793'>  The shape of theirs, my understanding bend</a>
<a id='line_7794'>  In honour to their honour: zeal, which yet</a>
<a id='line_7795'>  Had slumbered, now in opposition burst                             255</a>
<a id='line_7796'>  Forth like a Polar summer: every word</a>
<a id='line_7797'>  They uttered was a dart, by counter-winds</a>
<a id='line_7798'>  Blown back upon themselves; their reason seemed</a>
<a id='line_7799'>  Confusion-stricken by a higher power</a>
<a id='line_7800'>  Than human understanding, their discourse                          260</a>
<a id='line_7801'>  Maimed, spiritless; and, in their weakness strong,</a>
<a id='line_7802'>  I triumphed.</a>
<a id='line_7803'></a>
<a id='line_7804'>               Meantime, day by day, the roads</a>
<a id='line_7805'>  Were crowded with the bravest youth of France, [M]</a>
<a id='line_7806'>  And all the promptest of her spirits, linked</a>
<a id='line_7807'>  In gallant soldiership, and posting on                             265</a>
<a id='line_7808'>  To meet the war upon her frontier bounds.</a>
<a id='line_7809'>  Yet at this very moment do tears start</a>
<a id='line_7810'>  Into mine eyes: I do not say I weep--</a>
<a id='line_7811'>  I wept not then,--but tears have dimmed my sight,</a>
<a id='line_7812'>  In memory of the farewells of that time,                           270</a>
<a id='line_7813'>  Domestic severings, female fortitude</a>
<a id='line_7814'>  At dearest separation, patriot love</a>
<a id='line_7815'>  And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,</a>
<a id='line_7816'>  Encouraged with a martyr's confidence;</a>
<a id='line_7817'>  Even files of strangers merely seen but once,                      275</a>
<a id='line_7818'>  And for a moment, men from far with sound</a>
<a id='line_7819'>  Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread,</a>
<a id='line_7820'>  Entering the city, here and there a face,</a>
<a id='line_7821'>  Or person singled out among the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7822'>  Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;                          280</a>
<a id='line_7823'>  Even by these passing spectacles my heart</a>
<a id='line_7824'>  Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed</a>
<a id='line_7825'>  Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause</a>
<a id='line_7826'>  Good, pure, which no one could stand up against,</a>
<a id='line_7827'>  Who was not lost, abandoned, selfish, proud,                       285</a>
<a id='line_7828'>  Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,</a>
<a id='line_7829'>  Hater perverse of equity and truth.</a>
<a id='line_7830'></a>
<a id='line_7831'>    Among that band of Officers was one,</a>
<a id='line_7832'>  Already hinted at, [N] of other mould--</a>
<a id='line_7833'>  A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,                            290</a>
<a id='line_7834'>  And with an oriental loathing spurned,</a>
<a id='line_7835'>  As of a different caste. A meeker man</a>
<a id='line_7836'>  Than this lived never, nor a more benign,</a>
<a id='line_7837'>  Meek though enthusiastic. Injuries</a>
<a id='line_7838'>  Made _him_ more gracious, and his nature then                      295</a>
<a id='line_7839'>  Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,</a>
<a id='line_7840'>  As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,</a>
<a id='line_7841'>  When foot hath crushed them. He through the events</a>
<a id='line_7842'>  Of that great change wandered in perfect faith,</a>
<a id='line_7843'>  As through a book, an old romance, or tale                         300</a>
<a id='line_7844'>  Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought</a>
<a id='line_7845'>  Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked</a>
<a id='line_7846'>  With the most noble, but unto the poor</a>
<a id='line_7847'>  Among mankind he was in service bound,</a>
<a id='line_7848'>  As by some tie invisible, oaths professed                          305</a>
<a id='line_7849'>  To a religious order. Man he loved</a>
<a id='line_7850'>  As man; and, to the mean and the obscure,</a>
<a id='line_7851'>  And all the homely in their homely works,</a>
<a id='line_7852'>  Transferred a courtesy which had no air</a>
<a id='line_7853'>  Of condescension; but did rather seem                              310</a>
<a id='line_7854'>  A passion and a gallantry, like that</a>
<a id='line_7855'>  Which he, a soldier, in his idler day</a>
<a id='line_7856'>  Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,</a>
<a id='line_7857'>  Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,</a>
<a id='line_7858'>  But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy                            315</a>
<a id='line_7859'>  Diffused around him, while he was intent</a>
<a id='line_7860'>  On works of love or freedom, or revolved</a>
<a id='line_7861'>  Complacently the progress of a cause,</a>
<a id='line_7862'>  Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek</a>
<a id='line_7863'>  And placid, and took nothing from the man                          320</a>
<a id='line_7864'>  That was delightful. Oft in solitude</a>
<a id='line_7865'>  With him did I discourse about the end</a>
<a id='line_7866'>  Of civil government, and its wisest forms;</a>
<a id='line_7867'>  Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,</a>
<a id='line_7868'>  Custom and habit, novelty and change;                              325</a>
<a id='line_7869'>  Of self-respect, and virtue in the few</a>
<a id='line_7870'>  For patrimonial honour set apart,</a>
<a id='line_7871'>  And ignorance in the labouring multitude.</a>
<a id='line_7872'>  For he, to all intolerance indisposed,</a>
<a id='line_7873'>  Balanced these contemplations in his mind;                         330</a>
<a id='line_7874'>  And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped</a>
<a id='line_7875'>  Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment</a>
<a id='line_7876'>  Than later days allowed; carried about me,</a>
<a id='line_7877'>  With less alloy to its integrity,</a>
<a id='line_7878'>  The experience of past ages, as, through help                      335</a>
<a id='line_7879'>  Of books and common life, it makes sure way</a>
<a id='line_7880'>  To youthful minds, by objects over near</a>
<a id='line_7881'>  Not pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled</a>
<a id='line_7882'>  By struggling with the crowd for present ends.</a>
<a id='line_7883'></a>
<a id='line_7884'>    But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find                       340</a>
<a id='line_7885'>  Error without excuse upon the side</a>
<a id='line_7886'>  Of them who strove against us, more delight</a>
<a id='line_7887'>  We took, and let this freely be confessed,</a>
<a id='line_7888'>  In painting to ourselves the miseries</a>
<a id='line_7889'>  Of royal courts, and that voluptuous life                          345</a>
<a id='line_7890'>  Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul</a>
<a id='line_7891'>  The meanest thrives the most; where dignity,</a>
<a id='line_7892'>  True personal dignity, abideth not;</a>
<a id='line_7893'>  A light, a cruel, and vain world cut off</a>
<a id='line_7894'>  From the natural inlets of just sentiment,                         350</a>
<a id='line_7895'>  From lowly sympathy and chastening truth;</a>
<a id='line_7896'>  Where good and evil interchange their names,</a>
<a id='line_7897'>  And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired</a>
<a id='line_7898'>  With vice at home. We added dearest themes--</a>
<a id='line_7899'>  Man and his noble nature, as it is                                 355</a>
<a id='line_7900'>  The gift which God has placed within his power,</a>
<a id='line_7901'>  His blind desires and steady faculties</a>
<a id='line_7902'>  Capable of clear truth, the one to break</a>
<a id='line_7903'>  Bondage, the other to build liberty</a>
<a id='line_7904'>  On firm foundations, making social life,                           360</a>
<a id='line_7905'>  Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,</a>
<a id='line_7906'>  As just in regulation, and as pure</a>
<a id='line_7907'>  As individual in the wise and good.</a>
<a id='line_7908'></a>
<a id='line_7909'>    We summoned up the honourable deeds</a>
<a id='line_7910'>  Of ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,                     365</a>
<a id='line_7911'>  That would be found in all recorded time,</a>
<a id='line_7912'>  Of truth preserved and error passed away;</a>
<a id='line_7913'>  Of single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_7914'>  And how the multitudes of men will feed</a>
<a id='line_7915'>  And fan each other; thought of sects, how keen                     370</a>
<a id='line_7916'>  They are to put the appropriate nature on,</a>
<a id='line_7917'>  Triumphant over every obstacle</a>
<a id='line_7918'>  Of custom, language, country, love, or hate,</a>
<a id='line_7919'>  And what they do and suffer for their creed;</a>
<a id='line_7920'>  How far they travel, and how long endure;                          375</a>
<a id='line_7921'>  How quickly mighty Nations have been formed,</a>
<a id='line_7922'>  From least beginnings; how, together locked</a>
<a id='line_7923'>  By new opinions, scattered tribes have made</a>
<a id='line_7924'>  One body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_7925'>  To aspirations then of our own minds                               380</a>
<a id='line_7926'>  Did we appeal; and, finally, beheld</a>
<a id='line_7927'>  A living confirmation of the whole</a>
<a id='line_7928'>  Before us, in a people from the depth</a>
<a id='line_7929'>  Of shameful imbecility uprisen,</a>
<a id='line_7930'>  Fresh as the morning star. Elate we looked                         385</a>
<a id='line_7931'>  Upon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,</a>
<a id='line_7932'>  Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,</a>
<a id='line_7933'>  And continence of mind, and sense of right,</a>
<a id='line_7934'>  Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.</a>
<a id='line_7935'></a>
<a id='line_7936'>    Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,                             390</a>
<a id='line_7937'>  Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known</a>
<a id='line_7938'>  In the green dales beside our Rotha's stream,</a>
<a id='line_7939'>  Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,</a>
<a id='line_7940'>  To ruminate, with interchange of talk,</a>
<a id='line_7941'>  On rational liberty, and hope in man,                              395</a>
<a id='line_7942'>  Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil--</a>
<a id='line_7943'>  Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse--</a>
<a id='line_7944'>  If nature then be standing on the brink</a>
<a id='line_7945'>  Of some great trial, and we hear the voice</a>
<a id='line_7946'>  Of one devoted, one whom circumstance                              400</a>
<a id='line_7947'>  Hath called upon to embody his deep sense</a>
<a id='line_7948'>  In action, give it outwardly a shape,</a>
<a id='line_7949'>  And that of benediction, to the world.</a>
<a id='line_7950'>  Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,--</a>
<a id='line_7951'>  A hope it is, and a desire; a creed                                405</a>
<a id='line_7952'>  Of zeal, by an authority Divine</a>
<a id='line_7953'>  Sanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death.</a>
<a id='line_7954'>  Such conversation, under Attic shades,</a>
<a id='line_7955'>  Did Dion hold with Plato; [O] ripened thus</a>
<a id='line_7956'>  For a Deliverer's glorious task,--and such                         410</a>
<a id='line_7957'>  He, on that ministry already bound,</a>
<a id='line_7958'>  Held with Eudemus and Timonides, [P]</a>
<a id='line_7959'>  Surrounded by adventurers in arms,</a>
<a id='line_7960'>  When those two vessels with their daring freight,</a>
<a id='line_7961'>  For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,                               415</a>
<a id='line_7962'>  Sailed from Zacynthus,--philosophic war,</a>
<a id='line_7963'>  Led by Philosophers. [Q] With harder fate,</a>
<a id='line_7964'>  Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!</a>
<a id='line_7965'>  Of whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name</a>
<a id='line_7966'>  Stand near the worthiest of Antiquity)                             420</a>
<a id='line_7967'>  Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse,</a>
<a id='line_7968'>  With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:</a>
<a id='line_7969'>  He, on his part, accoutred for the worst.</a>
<a id='line_7970'>  He perished fighting, in supreme command,</a>
<a id='line_7971'>  Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,                             425</a>
<a id='line_7972'>  For liberty, against deluded men,</a>
<a id='line_7973'>  His fellow country-men; and yet most blessed</a>
<a id='line_7974'>  In this, that he the fate of later times</a>
<a id='line_7975'>  Lived not to see, nor what we now behold,</a>
<a id='line_7976'>  Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.                          430</a>
<a id='line_7977'></a>
<a id='line_7978'>  Along that very Loire, with festal mirth</a>
<a id='line_7979'>  Resounding at all hours, and innocent yet</a>
<a id='line_7980'>  Of civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;</a>
<a id='line_7981'>  Or in wide forests of continuous shade,</a>
<a id='line_7982'>  Lofty and over-arched, with open space                             435</a>
<a id='line_7983'>  Beneath the trees, clear footing many a mile--</a>
<a id='line_7984'>  A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,</a>
<a id='line_7985'>  From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,</a>
<a id='line_7986'>  And let remembrance steal to other times,</a>
<a id='line_7987'>  When, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,                      440</a>
<a id='line_7988'>  And smooth as marble or a waveless sea,</a>
<a id='line_7989'>  Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace</a>
<a id='line_7990'>  In sylvan meditation undisturbed;</a>
<a id='line_7991'>  As on the pavement of a Gothic church</a>
<a id='line_7992'>  Walks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,                      445</a>
<a id='line_7993'>  In peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,--</a>
<a id='line_7994'>  Heard, though unseen,--a devious traveller,</a>
<a id='line_7995'>  Retiring or approaching from afar</a>
<a id='line_7996'>  With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs</a>
<a id='line_7997'>  From the hard floor reverberated, then                             450</a>
<a id='line_7998'>  It was Angelica [R] thundering through the woods</a>
<a id='line_7999'>  Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid</a>
<a id='line_8000'>  Erminia, [S] fugitive as fair as she.</a>
<a id='line_8001'>  Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights</a>
<a id='line_8002'>  Joust underneath the trees, that as in storm                       455</a>
<a id='line_8003'>  Rocked high above their heads; anon, the din</a>
<a id='line_8004'>  Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar,</a>
<a id='line_8005'>  In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt</a>
<a id='line_8006'>  Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance</a>
<a id='line_8007'>  Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst,                              460</a>
<a id='line_8008'>  A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall.</a>
<a id='line_8009'>  The width of those huge forests, unto me</a>
<a id='line_8010'>  A novel scene, did often in this way</a>
<a id='line_8011'>  Master my fancy while I wandered on</a>
<a id='line_8012'>  With that revered companion. And sometimes--465</a>
<a id='line_8013'>  When to a convent in a meadow green,</a>
<a id='line_8014'>  By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,</a>
<a id='line_8015'>  And not by reverential touch of Time</a>
<a id='line_8016'>  Dismantled, but by violence abrupt--</a>
<a id='line_8017'>  In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,                        470</a>
<a id='line_8018'>  In spite of real fervour, and of that</a>
<a id='line_8019'>  Less genuine and wrought up within myself--</a>
<a id='line_8020'>  I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,</a>
<a id='line_8021'>  And for the Matin-bell to sound no more</a>
<a id='line_8022'>  Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross                     475</a>
<a id='line_8023'>  High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign</a>
<a id='line_8024'>  (How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!)</a>
<a id='line_8025'>  Of hospitality and peaceful rest.</a>
<a id='line_8026'>  And when the partner of those varied walks</a>
<a id='line_8027'>  Pointed upon occasion to the site                                  480</a>
<a id='line_8028'>  Of Romorentin, home of ancient kings, [T]</a>
<a id='line_8029'>  To the imperial edifice of Blois, [U]</a>
<a id='line_8030'>  Or to that rural castle, name now slipped</a>
<a id='line_8031'>  From my remembrance, where a lady lodged, [V]</a>
<a id='line_8032'>  By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him                       485</a>
<a id='line_8033'>  In chains of mutual passion, from the tower,</a>
<a id='line_8034'>  As a tradition of the country tells,</a>
<a id='line_8035'>  Practised to commune with her royal knight</a>
<a id='line_8036'>  By cressets and love-beacons, intercourse</a>
<a id='line_8037'>  'Twixt her high-seated residence and his                           490</a>
<a id='line_8038'>  Far off at Chambord on the plain beneath; [W]</a>
<a id='line_8039'>  Even here, though less than with the peaceful house</a>
<a id='line_8040'>  Religious, 'mid those frequent monuments</a>
<a id='line_8041'>  Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds,</a>
<a id='line_8042'>  Imagination, potent to inflame                                     495</a>
<a id='line_8043'>  At times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn,</a>
<a id='line_8044'>  Did also often mitigate the force</a>
<a id='line_8045'>  Of civic prejudice, the bigotry,</a>
<a id='line_8046'>  So call it, of a youthful patriot's mind;</a>
<a id='line_8047'>  And on these spots with many gleams I looked                       500</a>
<a id='line_8048'>  Of chivalrous delight. Yet not the less,</a>
<a id='line_8049'>  Hatred of absolute rule, where will of one</a>
<a id='line_8050'>  Is law for all, and of that barren pride</a>
<a id='line_8051'>  In them who, by immunities unjust,</a>
<a id='line_8052'>  Between the sovereign and the people stand,                        505</a>
<a id='line_8053'>  His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold</a>
<a id='line_8054'>  Daily upon me, mixed with pity too</a>
<a id='line_8055'>  And love; for where hope is, there love will be</a>
<a id='line_8056'>  For the abject multitude. And when we chanced</a>
<a id='line_8057'>  One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl,                              510</a>
<a id='line_8058'>  Who crept along fitting her languid gait</a>
<a id='line_8059'>  Unto a heifer's motion, by a cord</a>
<a id='line_8060'>  Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane</a>
<a id='line_8061'>  Its sustenance, while the girl with pallid hands</a>
<a id='line_8062'>  Was busy knitting in a heartless mood                              515</a>

<a id='line_8234'>efforts to influence and elevate Dionysius. Dion withdrew to Athens, and</a>
<a id='line_8235'>lived in close intimacy with Plato, and with Speusippus. The latter</a>
<a id='line_8236'>urged him to return, and deliver Sicily from the tyrant Dionysius, who</a>
<a id='line_8237'>had become unpopular in the island. Dion got some of the Syracusan</a>
<a id='line_8238'>exiles in Greece to join him, and "sailed from Zacynthus," with two</a>
<a id='line_8239'>merchant ships, and about 800 troops. He took Syracuse, and became</a>

<a id='line_8241'>French Revolution who took the place of those of the old regime (record</a>

<a id='line_8364'>  The tender mercies of the dismal wind</a>
<a id='line_8365'>  That bore it--on the plains of Liberty                              15</a>

<a id='line_8370'>  Rajahs and Omrahs [C] in his train, intent                          20</a>

<a id='line_8374'>  Narrowing itself by moments--they, rash men,</a>

<a id='line_8376'>  Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled</a>
<a id='line_8377'>  In terror. Disappointment and dismay</a>
<a id='line_8378'>  Remained for all whose fancies had run wild</a>
<a id='line_8379'>  With evil expectations; confidence</a>
<a id='line_8380'>  And perfect triumph for the better cause.                           30</a>

<a id='line_8390'>  Spared not the empty throne, and in proud haste</a>
<a id='line_8391'>  Assumed the body and venerable name                                 40</a>
<a id='line_8392'>  Of a Republic. [D] Lamentable crimes,</a>
<a id='line_8393'>  'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire work</a>
<a id='line_8394'>  Of massacre, [E] in which the senseless sword</a>
<a id='line_8395'>  Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past,</a>
<a id='line_8396'>  Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,--45</a>
<a id='line_8397'>  Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once!</a>
<a id='line_8398'>  Things that could only show themselves and die.</a>
<a id='line_8399'></a>
<a id='line_8400'>    Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned, [F]</a>
<a id='line_8401'>  And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,</a>
<a id='line_8402'>  The spacious city, and in progress passed                           50</a>
<a id='line_8403'>  The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay,</a>
<a id='line_8404'>  Associate with his children and his wife</a>
<a id='line_8405'>  In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed</a>
<a id='line_8406'>  With roar of cannon by a furious host.</a>
<a id='line_8407'>  I crossed the square (an empty area then!) [G]                      55</a>
<a id='line_8408'>  Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain</a>
<a id='line_8409'>  The dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazed</a>
<a id='line_8410'>  On this and other spots, as doth a man</a>
<a id='line_8411'>  Upon a volume whose contents he knows</a>
<a id='line_8412'>  Are memorable, but from him locked up,                              60</a>
<a id='line_8413'>  Being written in a tongue he cannot read,</a>
<a id='line_8414'>  So that he questions the mute leaves with pain,</a>
<a id='line_8415'>  And half upbraids their silence. But that night</a>
<a id='line_8416'>  I felt most deeply in what world I was,</a>
<a id='line_8417'>  What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.                     65</a>
<a id='line_8418'>  High was my room and lonely, near the roof</a>
<a id='line_8419'>  Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge</a>
<a id='line_8420'>  That would have pleased me in more quiet times;</a>
<a id='line_8421'>  Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.</a>
<a id='line_8422'>  With unextinguished taper I kept watch,                             70</a>
<a id='line_8423'>  Reading at intervals; the fear gone by</a>
<a id='line_8424'>  Pressed on me almost like a fear to come.</a>
<a id='line_8425'>  I thought of those September massacres,</a>
<a id='line_8426'>  Divided from me by one little month,  [H]</a>
<a id='line_8427'>  Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured up                      75</a>
<a id='line_8428'>  From tragic fictions or true history,</a>
<a id='line_8429'>  Remembrances and dim admonishments.</a>
<a id='line_8430'>  The horse is taught his manage, and no star</a>
<a id='line_8431'>  Of wildest course but treads back his own steps;</a>
<a id='line_8432'>  For the spent hurricane the air provides                            80</a>
<a id='line_8433'>  As fierce a successor; the tide retreats</a>
<a id='line_8434'>  But to return out of its hiding-place</a>
<a id='line_8435'>  In the great deep; all things have second-birth;</a>
<a id='line_8436'>  The earthquake is not satisfied at once;</a>
<a id='line_8437'>  And in this way I wrought upon myself,                              85</a>
<a id='line_8438'>  Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,</a>
<a id='line_8439'>  To the whole city, "Sleep no more." The trance</a>
<a id='line_8440'>  Fled with the voice to which it had given birth;</a>
<a id='line_8441'>  But vainly comments of a calmer mind</a>
<a id='line_8442'>  Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness.                        90</a>
<a id='line_8443'>  The place, all hushed and silent as it was,</a>
<a id='line_8444'>  Appeared unfit for the repose of night,</a>
<a id='line_8445'>  Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.</a>
<a id='line_8446'></a>
<a id='line_8447'>    With early morning towards the Palace-walk</a>
<a id='line_8448'>  Of OrlÃ©ans eagerly I turned; as yet                                 95</a>
<a id='line_8449'>  The streets were still; not so those long Arcades;</a>
<a id='line_8450'>  There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,</a>
<a id='line_8451'>  That greeted me on entering, I could hear</a>
<a id='line_8452'>  Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng,</a>
<a id='line_8453'>  Bawling, "Denunciation of the Crimes                               100</a>
<a id='line_8454'>  Of Maximilian Robespierre;" the hand,</a>
<a id='line_8455'>  Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech,</a>
<a id='line_8456'>  The same that had been recently pronounced,</a>
<a id='line_8457'>  When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark</a>
<a id='line_8458'>  Some words of indirect reproof had been                            105</a>
<a id='line_8459'>  Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared</a>
<a id='line_8460'>  The man who had an ill surmise of him</a>
<a id='line_8461'>  To bring his charge in openness; whereat,</a>
<a id='line_8462'>  When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred,</a>
<a id='line_8463'>  In silence of all present, from his seat                           110</a>
<a id='line_8464'>  Louvet walked single through the avenue,</a>
<a id='line_8465'>  And took his station in the Tribune, saying,</a>
<a id='line_8466'>  "I, Robespierre, accuse thee!" [I] Well is known</a>
<a id='line_8467'>  The inglorious issue of that charge, and how</a>
<a id='line_8468'>  He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,                    115</a>
<a id='line_8469'>  The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded,</a>
<a id='line_8470'>  Was left without a follower to discharge</a>
<a id='line_8471'>  His perilous duty, and retire lamenting</a>
<a id='line_8472'>  That Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men</a>
<a id='line_8473'>  Who to themselves are false. [K]</a>
<a id='line_8474'>                  But these are things                               120</a>
<a id='line_8475'>  Of which I speak, only as they were storm</a>
<a id='line_8476'>  Or sunshine to my individual mind,</a>
<a id='line_8477'>  No further. Let me then relate that now--</a>
<a id='line_8478'>  In some sort seeing with my proper eyes</a>
<a id='line_8479'>  That Liberty, and Life, and Death would soon                       125</a>
<a id='line_8480'>  To the remotest corners of the land</a>
<a id='line_8481'>  Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled</a>
<a id='line_8482'>  The capital City; what was struggled for,</a>
<a id='line_8483'>  And by what combatants victory must be won;</a>
<a id='line_8484'>  The indecision on their part whose aim                             130</a>
<a id='line_8485'>  Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those</a>
<a id='line_8486'>  Who in attack or in defence were strong</a>
<a id='line_8487'>  Through their impiety--my inmost soul</a>
<a id='line_8488'>  Was agitated; yea, I could almost</a>
<a id='line_8489'>  Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men,                    135</a>
<a id='line_8490'>  By patient exercise of reason made</a>
<a id='line_8491'>  Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled</a>
<a id='line_8492'>  With zeal expanding in Truth's holy light,</a>
<a id='line_8493'>  The gift of tongues might fall, and power arrive</a>
<a id='line_8494'>  From the four quarters of the winds to do                          140</a>
<a id='line_8495'>  For France, what without help she could not do,</a>
<a id='line_8496'>  A work of honour; think not that to this</a>
<a id='line_8497'>  I added, work of safety: from all doubt</a>
<a id='line_8498'>  Or trepidation for the end of things</a>
<a id='line_8499'>  Far was I, far as angels are from guilt.                           145</a>
<a id='line_8500'></a>
<a id='line_8501'>    Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought</a>
<a id='line_8502'>  Of opposition and of remedies:</a>
<a id='line_8503'>  An insignificant stranger and obscure,</a>
<a id='line_8504'>  And one, moreover, little graced with power</a>
<a id='line_8505'>  Of eloquence even in my native speech,                             150</a>
<a id='line_8506'>  And all unfit for tumult or intrigue,</a>
<a id='line_8507'>  Yet would I at this time with willing heart</a>
<a id='line_8508'>  Have undertaken for a cause so great</a>
<a id='line_8509'>  Service however dangerous. I revolved,</a>
<a id='line_8510'>  How much the destiny of Man had still                              155</a>
<a id='line_8511'>  Hung upon single persons; that there was,</a>
<a id='line_8512'>  Transcendent to all local patrimony,</a>
<a id='line_8513'>  One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;</a>
<a id='line_8514'>  That objects, even as they are great, thereby</a>
<a id='line_8515'>  Do come within the reach of humblest eyes;                         160</a>
<a id='line_8516'>  That Man is only weak through his mistrust</a>
<a id='line_8517'>  And want of hope where evidence divine</a>
<a id='line_8518'>  Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure;</a>
<a id='line_8519'>  Nor did the inexperience of my youth</a>
<a id='line_8520'>  Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong,                         165</a>
<a id='line_8521'>  In hope, and trained to noble aspirations,</a>
<a id='line_8522'>  A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,</a>
<a id='line_8523'>  Is for Society's unreasoning herd</a>
<a id='line_8524'>  A domineering instinct, serves at once</a>
<a id='line_8525'>  For way and guide, a fluent receptacle                             170</a>
<a id='line_8526'>  That gathers up each petty straggling rill</a>
<a id='line_8527'>  And vein of water, glad to be rolled on</a>
<a id='line_8528'>  In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest</a>
<a id='line_8529'>  Is where it ought to be, in self-restraint,</a>
<a id='line_8530'>  In circumspection and simplicity,                                  175</a>
<a id='line_8531'>  Falls rarely in entire discomfiture</a>
<a id='line_8532'>  Below its aim, or meets with, from without,</a>
<a id='line_8533'>  A treachery that foils it or defeats;</a>
<a id='line_8534'>  And, lastly, if the means on human will,</a>
<a id='line_8535'>  Frail human will, dependent should betray                          180</a>
<a id='line_8536'>  Him who too boldly trusted them, I felt</a>
<a id='line_8537'>  That 'mid the loud distractions of the world</a>
<a id='line_8538'>  A sovereign voice subsists within the soul,</a>
<a id='line_8539'>  Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong,</a>
<a id='line_8540'>  Of life and death, in majesty severe                               185</a>
<a id='line_8541'>  Enjoining, as may best promote the aims</a>
<a id='line_8542'>  Of truth and justice, either sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_8543'>  From whatsoever region of our cares</a>

<a id='line_8545'>  Earnest and blind, against the stern decree.                       190</a>
<a id='line_8546'></a>
<a id='line_8547'>  On the other side, I called to mind those truths</a>
<a id='line_8548'>  That are the common-places of the schools--</a>
<a id='line_8549'>  (A theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)</a>
<a id='line_8550'>  Yet, with a revelation's liveliness,</a>
<a id='line_8551'>  In all their comprehensive bearings known                          195</a>
<a id='line_8552'>  And visible to philosophers of old,</a>
<a id='line_8553'>  Men who, to business of the world untrained,</a>

<a id='line_8555'>  And his compeer Aristogiton, [L] known</a>
<a id='line_8556'>  To Brutus--that tyrannic power is weak,                            200</a>
<a id='line_8557'>  Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love,</a>
<a id='line_8558'>  Nor the support of good or evil men</a>
<a id='line_8559'>  To trust in; that the godhead which is ours</a>
<a id='line_8560'>  Can never utterly be charmed or stilled;</a>
<a id='line_8561'>  That nothing hath a natural right to last                          205</a>

<a id='line_8563'>  Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best</a>

<a id='line_8565'></a>
<a id='line_8566'>  Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_8567'>  Strong and perturbed, not doubting at that time                    210</a>
<a id='line_8568'>  But that the virtue of one paramount mind</a>
<a id='line_8569'>  Would have abashed those impious crests--have quelled</a>
<a id='line_8570'>  Outrage and bloody power, and, in despite</a>
<a id='line_8571'>  Of what the People long had been and were</a>
<a id='line_8572'>  Through ignorance and false teaching, sadder proof                 215</a>

<a id='line_8579'>                  In this frame of mind,</a>
<a id='line_8580'>  Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,</a>

<a id='line_8623'>  What, then, were my emotions, when in arms</a>
<a id='line_8624'>  Britain put forth her free-born strength in league,</a>
<a id='line_8625'>  Oh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!                 265</a>
<a id='line_8626'>  Not in my single self alone I found,</a>

<a id='line_8628'>  Change and subversion from that hour. No shock</a>
<a id='line_8629'>  Given to my moral nature had I known</a>
<a id='line_8630'>  Down to that very moment; neither lapse                            270</a>
<a id='line_8631'>  Nor turn of sentiment that might be named</a>
<a id='line_8632'>  A revolution, save at this one time;</a>
<a id='line_8633'>  All else was progress on the self-same path</a>
<a id='line_8634'>  On which, with a diversity of pace,</a>
<a id='line_8635'>  I had been travelling: this a stride at once                       275</a>
<a id='line_8636'>  Into another region. As a light</a>
<a id='line_8637'>  And pliant harebell, swinging in the breeze</a>
<a id='line_8638'>  On some grey rock--its birth-place--so had I</a>
<a id='line_8639'>  Wantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower</a>
<a id='line_8640'>  Of my beloved country, wishing not                                 280</a>
<a id='line_8641'>  A happier fortune than to wither there:</a>
<a id='line_8642'>  Now was I from that pleasant station torn</a>
<a id='line_8643'>  And tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,</a>
<a id='line_8644'>  Yea, afterwards--truth most painful to record!--</a>
<a id='line_8645'>  Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,                                285</a>
<a id='line_8646'>  When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_8647'>  Left without glory on the field, or driven,</a>
<a id='line_8648'>  Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,--</a>
<a id='line_8649'>  Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that,--</a>
<a id='line_8650'>  A conflict of sensations without name,                             290</a>
<a id='line_8651'>  Of which _he_ only, who may love the sight</a>

<a id='line_8653'>  When, in the congregation bending all</a>

<a id='line_8656'>  And, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance</a>

<a id='line_8658'>  Whom no one owned, sate silent; shall I add,</a>
<a id='line_8659'>  Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.</a>
<a id='line_8660'></a>
<a id='line_8661'>  Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear,                 300</a>

<a id='line_8676'></a>

<a id='line_8682'>  Through a whole month of calm and glassy days                      320</a>

<a id='line_8689'>  That voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me</a>

<a id='line_8745'>  Nor could have been, without her blessed name.                     380</a>
<a id='line_8746'>  The illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour</a>
<a id='line_8747'>  Of her composure, felt that agony,</a>
<a id='line_8748'>  And gave it vent in her last words. [U] O Friend!</a>
<a id='line_8749'>  It was a lamentable time for man,</a>
<a id='line_8750'>  Whether a hope had e'er been his or not;                           385</a>
<a id='line_8751'>  A woful time for them whose hopes survived</a>
<a id='line_8752'>  The shock; most woful for those few who still</a>
<a id='line_8753'>  Were flattered, and had trust in human kind:</a>
<a id='line_8754'>  They had the deepest feeling of the grief.</a>
<a id='line_8755'>  Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved:                     390</a>
<a id='line_8756'>  The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,</a>
<a id='line_8757'>  And throttled with an infant godhead's might</a>
<a id='line_8758'>  The snakes about her cradle; that was well,</a>
<a id='line_8759'>  And as it should be; yet no cure for them</a>
<a id='line_8760'>  Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be                   395</a>
<a id='line_8761'>  Hereafter brought in charge against mankind.</a>
<a id='line_8762'>  Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!</a>
<a id='line_8763'>  Were my day-thoughts,--my nights were miserable;</a>
<a id='line_8764'>  Through months, through years, long after the last beat</a>
<a id='line_8765'>  Of those atrocities, the hour of sleep                             400</a>
<a id='line_8766'>  To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,</a>
<a id='line_8767'>  Such ghastly visions had I of despair</a>
<a id='line_8768'>  And tyranny, and implements of death;</a>
<a id='line_8769'>  And innocent victims sinking under fear,</a>
<a id='line_8770'>  And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,                           405</a>
<a id='line_8771'>  Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowds</a>
<a id='line_8772'>  For sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth</a>
<a id='line_8773'>  And levity in dungeons, where the dust</a>
<a id='line_8774'>  Was laid with tears. Then suddenly the scene</a>
<a id='line_8775'>  Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me                       410</a>
<a id='line_8776'>  In long orations, which I strove to plead</a>
<a id='line_8777'>  Before unjust tribunals,--with a voice</a>
<a id='line_8778'>  Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,</a>
<a id='line_8779'>  Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt</a>
<a id='line_8780'>  In the last place of refuge--my own soul.                          415</a>
<a id='line_8781'></a>
<a id='line_8782'>    When I began in youth's delightful prime</a>
<a id='line_8783'>  To yield myself to Nature, when that strong</a>
<a id='line_8784'>  And holy passion overcame me first,</a>
<a id='line_8785'>  Nor day nor night, evening or morn, was free</a>
<a id='line_8786'>  From its oppression. But, O Power Supreme!                         420</a>
<a id='line_8787'>  Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe,</a>
<a id='line_8788'>  Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill</a>
<a id='line_8789'>  The veins that branch through every frame of life,</a>
<a id='line_8790'>  Making man what he is, creature divine,</a>
<a id='line_8791'>  In single or in social eminence,                                   425</a>
<a id='line_8792'>  Above the rest raised infinite ascents</a>
<a id='line_8793'>  When reason that enables him to be</a>
<a id='line_8794'>  Is not sequestered--what a change is here!</a>
<a id='line_8795'>  How different ritual for this after-worship,</a>
<a id='line_8796'>  What countenance to promote this second love!                      430</a>
<a id='line_8797'>  The first was service paid to things which lie</a>
<a id='line_8798'>  Guarded within the bosom of Thy will.</a>
<a id='line_8799'>  Therefore to serve was high beatitude;</a>
<a id='line_8800'>  Tumult was therefore gladness, and the fear</a>
<a id='line_8801'>  Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure,                                435</a>
<a id='line_8802'>  And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.</a>
<a id='line_8803'></a>
<a id='line_8804'>    But as the ancient Prophets, borne aloft</a>
<a id='line_8805'>  In vision, yet constrained by natural laws</a>
<a id='line_8806'>  With them to take a troubled human heart,</a>
<a id='line_8807'>  Wanted not consolations, nor a creed                               440</a>
<a id='line_8808'>  Of reconcilement, then when they denounced,</a>
<a id='line_8809'>  On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss</a>
<a id='line_8810'>  Of their offences, punishment to come;</a>
<a id='line_8811'>  Or saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8812'>  Before them, in some desolated place,                              445</a>
<a id='line_8813'>  The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;</a>
<a id='line_8814'>  So, with devout humility be it said,</a>
<a id='line_8815'>  So, did a portion of that spirit fall</a>
<a id='line_8816'>  On me uplifted from the vantage-ground</a>
<a id='line_8817'>  Of pity and sorrow to a state of being                             450</a>
<a id='line_8818'>  That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw</a>
<a id='line_8819'>  Glimpses of retribution, terrible,</a>
<a id='line_8820'>  And in the order of sublime behests:</a>
<a id='line_8821'>  But, even if that were not, amid the awe</a>
<a id='line_8822'>  Of unintelligible chastisement,                                    455</a>
<a id='line_8823'>  Not only acquiescences of faith</a>
<a id='line_8824'>  Survived, but daring sympathies with power,</a>
<a id='line_8825'>  Motions not treacherous or profane, else why</a>
<a id='line_8826'>  Within the folds of no ungentle breast</a>
<a id='line_8827'>  Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?                      460</a>
<a id='line_8828'>  Wild blasts of music thus could find their way</a>
<a id='line_8829'>  Into the midst of turbulent events;</a>
<a id='line_8830'>  So that worst tempests might be listened to.</a>
<a id='line_8831'>  Then was the truth received into my heart,</a>
<a id='line_8832'>  That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,                       465</a>
<a id='line_8833'>  If from the affliction somewhere do not grow</a>
<a id='line_8834'>  Honour which could not else have been, a faith,</a>
<a id='line_8835'>  An elevation and a sanctity,</a>
<a id='line_8836'>  If new strength be not given nor old restored,</a>
<a id='line_8837'>  The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt                      470</a>
<a id='line_8838'>  Was taken up by scoffers in their pride,</a>
<a id='line_8839'>  Saying, "Behold the harvest that we reap</a>
<a id='line_8840'>  From popular government and equality,"</a>
<a id='line_8841'>  I clearly saw that neither these nor aught</a>
<a id='line_8842'>  Of wild belief engrafted on their names                            475</a>
<a id='line_8843'>  By false philosophy had caused the woe,</a>
<a id='line_8844'>  But a terrific reservoir of guilt</a>
<a id='line_8845'>  And ignorance rilled up from age to age,</a>
<a id='line_8846'>  That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,</a>
<a id='line_8847'>  But burst and spread in deluge through the land.                   480</a>
<a id='line_8848'></a>
<a id='line_8849'>    And as the desert hath green spots, the sea</a>
<a id='line_8850'>  Small islands scattered amid stormy waves,</a>
<a id='line_8851'>  So that disastrous period did not want</a>
<a id='line_8852'>  Bright sprinklings of all human excellence,</a>
<a id='line_8853'>  To which the silver wands of saints in Heaven                      485</a>
<a id='line_8854'>  Might point with rapturous joy. Yet not the less,</a>
<a id='line_8855'>  For those examples in no age surpassed</a>
<a id='line_8856'>  Of fortitude and energy and love,</a>
<a id='line_8857'>  And human nature faithful to herself</a>
<a id='line_8858'>  Under worst trials, was I driven to think                          490</a>
<a id='line_8859'>  Of the glad times when first I traversed France</a>
<a id='line_8860'>  A youthful pilgrim; [V] above all reviewed</a>

<a id='line_8864'>  Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed, [W]</a>
<a id='line_8865'>  I paced, a dear companion at my side,</a>

<a id='line_8874'>  Under the vengeance of her cruel son,</a>
<a id='line_8875'>  As Lear reproached the winds--I could almost</a>

<a id='line_8913'>  Fell from me in my own despite. But now</a>
<a id='line_8914'>  I thought, still traversing that widespread plain,                 545</a>

<a id='line_8916'>  Upon his tombstone, whispering to myself:</a>
<a id='line_8917'>  He loved the Poets, and, if now alive,</a>
<a id='line_8918'>  Would have loved me, as one not destitute</a>
<a id='line_8919'>  Of promise, nor belying the kind hope                              550</a>
<a id='line_8920'>  That he had formed, when I, at his command,</a>
<a id='line_8921'>  Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs. [c]</a>
<a id='line_8922'></a>
<a id='line_8923'>  As I advanced, all that I saw or felt</a>

<a id='line_8929'>  A Romish chapel, [d] where the vested priest</a>
<a id='line_8930'>  Said matins at the hour that suited those                          560</a>

<a id='line_8932'>  Not far from that still ruin all the plain</a>

<a id='line_8934'>  Of vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,</a>
<a id='line_8935'>  Wading beneath the conduct of their guide                          565</a>
<a id='line_8936'>  In loose procession through the shallow stream</a>
<a id='line_8937'>  Of inland waters; the great sea meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_8938'>  Heaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,</a>
<a id='line_8939'>  Longing for skill to paint a scene so bright</a>

<a id='line_8941'>  As he approached, no salutation given</a>
<a id='line_8942'>  In the familiar language of the day,</a>
<a id='line_8943'>  Cried, "Robespierre is dead!"--nor was a doubt,</a>
<a id='line_8944'>  After strict question, left within my mind</a>
<a id='line_8945'>  That he and his supporters all were fallen.                        575</a>
<a id='line_8946'></a>
<a id='line_8947'>    Great was my transport, deep my gratitude</a>

<a id='line_8949'>  Made manifest. "Come now, ye golden times,"</a>
<a id='line_8950'>  Said I forth-pouring on those open sands</a>
<a id='line_8951'>  A hymn of triumph: "as the morning comes                           580</a>
<a id='line_8952'>  From out the bosom of the night, come ye:</a>
<a id='line_8953'>  Thus far our trust is verified; behold!</a>
<a id='line_8954'>  They who with clumsy desperation brought</a>
<a id='line_8955'>  A river of Blood, and preached that nothing else</a>
<a id='line_8956'>  Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might                      585</a>

<a id='line_8963'>  And how through hardships manifold and long</a>
<a id='line_8964'>  The glorious renovation would proceed.</a>
<a id='line_8965'>  Thus interrupted by uneasy bursts</a>

<a id='line_9210'>  From that time forth, [A] Authority in France</a>
<a id='line_9211'>  Put on a milder face; Terror had ceased,</a>
<a id='line_9212'>  Yet every thing was wanting that might give</a>
<a id='line_9213'>  Courage to them who looked for good by light</a>
<a id='line_9214'>  Of rational Experience, for the shoots                               5</a>
<a id='line_9215'>  And hopeful blossoms of a second spring:</a>
<a id='line_9216'>  Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;</a>
<a id='line_9217'>  The Senate's language, and the public acts</a>
<a id='line_9218'>  And measures of the Government, though both</a>
<a id='line_9219'>  Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power                          10</a>
<a id='line_9220'>  To daunt me; in the People was my trust,</a>
<a id='line_9221'>  And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen. [1]</a>
<a id='line_9222'>  I knew that wound external could not take</a>
<a id='line_9223'>  Life from the young Republic; that new foes</a>
<a id='line_9224'>  Would only follow, in the path of shame,                            15</a>
<a id='line_9225'>  Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end</a>
<a id='line_9226'>  Great, universal, irresistible.</a>
<a id='line_9227'>  This intuition led me to confound</a>
<a id='line_9228'>  One victory with another, higher far,--</a>
<a id='line_9229'>  Triumphs of unambitious peace at home,                              20</a>
<a id='line_9230'>  And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still</a>
<a id='line_9231'>  Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought</a>
<a id='line_9232'>  That what was in degree the same was likewise</a>
<a id='line_9233'>  The same in quality,--that, as the worse</a>
<a id='line_9234'>  Of the two spirits then at strife remained                          25</a>
<a id='line_9235'>  Untired, the better, surely, would preserve</a>
<a id='line_9236'>  The heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains,</a>
<a id='line_9237'>  In all conditions of society,</a>
<a id='line_9238'>  Communion more direct and intimate</a>
<a id='line_9239'>  With Nature,--hence, ofttimes, with reason too--30</a>
<a id='line_9240'>  Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then,</a>
<a id='line_9241'>  Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,</a>
<a id='line_9242'>  Had left an interregnum's open space</a>
<a id='line_9243'>  For _her_ to move about in, uncontrolled.</a>
<a id='line_9244'>  Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,                        35</a>
<a id='line_9245'>  Who, by the recent deluge stupified,</a>
<a id='line_9246'>  With their whole souls went culling from the day</a>
<a id='line_9247'>  Its petty promises, to build a tower</a>
<a id='line_9248'>  For their own safety; laughed with my compeers</a>
<a id='line_9249'>  At gravest heads, by enmity to France                               40</a>
<a id='line_9250'>  Distempered, till they found, in every blast</a>
<a id='line_9251'>  Forced from the street-disturbing newsman's horn,</a>
<a id='line_9252'>  For her great cause record or prophecy</a>
<a id='line_9253'>  Of utter ruin. How might we believe</a>
<a id='line_9254'>  That wisdom could, in any shape, come near                          45</a>
<a id='line_9255'>  Men clinging to delusions so insane?</a>
<a id='line_9256'>  And thus, experience proving that no few</a>
<a id='line_9257'>  Of our opinions had been just, we took</a>
<a id='line_9258'>  Like credit to ourselves where less was due,</a>
<a id='line_9259'>  And thought that other notions were as sound,                       50</a>
<a id='line_9260'>  Yea, could not but be right, because we saw</a>
<a id='line_9261'>  That foolish men opposed them.</a>
<a id='line_9262'>                                   To a strain</a>
<a id='line_9263'>  More animated I might here give way,</a>
<a id='line_9264'>  And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>  What in those days, through Britain, was performed                  55</a>
<a id='line_9266'>  To turn _all_ judgments out of their right course;</a>
<a id='line_9267'>  But this is passion over-near ourselves,</a>
<a id='line_9268'>  Reality too close and too intense,</a>
<a id='line_9269'>  And intermixed with something, in my mind,</a>
<a id='line_9270'>  Of scorn and condemnation personal,                                 60</a>
<a id='line_9271'>  That would profane the sanctity of verse.</a>
<a id='line_9272'>  Our Shepherds, this say merely, at that time</a>
<a id='line_9273'>  Acted, or seemed at least to act, like men</a>
<a id='line_9274'>  Thirsting to make the guardian crook of law</a>
<a id='line_9275'>  A tool of murder; [B] they who ruled the State,                     65</a>
<a id='line_9276'>  Though with such awful proof before their eyes</a>
<a id='line_9277'>  That he, who would sow death, reaps death, or worse,</a>
<a id='line_9278'>  And can reap nothing better, child-like longed</a>
<a id='line_9279'>  To imitate, not wise enough to avoid;</a>
<a id='line_9280'>  Or left (by mere timidity betrayed)                                 70</a>
<a id='line_9281'>  The plain straight road, for one no better chosen</a>
<a id='line_9282'>  Than if their wish had been to undermine</a>
<a id='line_9283'>  Justice, and make an end of Liberty. [B]</a>
<a id='line_9284'></a>
<a id='line_9285'>    But from these bitter truths I must return</a>
<a id='line_9286'>  To my own history. It hath been told                                75</a>
<a id='line_9287'>  That I was led to take an eager part</a>
<a id='line_9288'>  In arguments of civil polity,</a>
<a id='line_9289'>  Abruptly, and indeed before my time:</a>
<a id='line_9290'>  I had approached, like other youths, the shield</a>
<a id='line_9291'>  Of human nature from the golden side,                               80</a>
<a id='line_9292'>  And would have fought, even to the death, to attest</a>
<a id='line_9293'>  The quality of the metal which I saw.</a>
<a id='line_9294'>  What there is best in individual man,</a>
<a id='line_9295'>  Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,</a>
<a id='line_9296'>  Benevolent in small societies,                                      85</a>
<a id='line_9297'>  And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,</a>
<a id='line_9298'>  Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood</a>
<a id='line_9299'>  By reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,</a>
<a id='line_9300'>  As cause was given me afterwards to learn,</a>
<a id='line_9301'>  Not proof against the injuries of the day;                          90</a>
<a id='line_9302'>  Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,</a>
<a id='line_9303'>  Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,</a>
<a id='line_9304'>  And with such general insight into evil,</a>
<a id='line_9305'>  And of the bounds which sever it from good,</a>
<a id='line_9306'>  As books and common intercourse with life                           95</a>
<a id='line_9307'>  Must needs have given--to the inexperienced mind,</a>
<a id='line_9308'>  When the world travels in a beaten road,</a>
<a id='line_9309'>  Guide faithful as is needed--I began</a>
<a id='line_9310'>  To meditate with ardour on the rule</a>
<a id='line_9311'>  And management of nations; what it is                              100</a>
<a id='line_9312'>  And ought to be; and strove to learn how far</a>
<a id='line_9313'>  Their power or weakness, wealth or poverty,</a>
<a id='line_9314'>  Their happiness or misery, depends</a>
<a id='line_9315'>  Upon their laws, and fashion of the State.</a>
<a id='line_9316'></a>
<a id='line_9317'>    O pleasant exercise of hope and joy! [C]                         105</a>
<a id='line_9318'>  For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood</a>
<a id='line_9319'>  Upon our side, us who were strong in love!</a>
<a id='line_9320'>  Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,</a>
<a id='line_9321'>  But to be young was very Heaven! [D] O times,</a>
<a id='line_9322'>  In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways                        110</a>
<a id='line_9323'>  Of custom, law, and statute, took at once</a>
<a id='line_9324'>  The attraction of a country in romance!</a>
<a id='line_9325'>  When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights</a>
<a id='line_9326'>  When most intent on making of herself</a>
<a id='line_9327'>  A prime enchantress--to assist the work,                           115</a>
<a id='line_9328'>  Which then was going forward in her name!</a>
<a id='line_9329'>  Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,</a>
<a id='line_9330'>  The beauty wore of promise--that which sets</a>
<a id='line_9331'>  (As at some moments might not be unfelt</a>
<a id='line_9332'>  Among the bowers of Paradise itself)                               120</a>
<a id='line_9333'>  The budding rose above the rose full blown.</a>
<a id='line_9334'>  What temper at the prospect did not wake</a>
<a id='line_9335'>  To happiness unthought of? The inert</a>
<a id='line_9336'>  Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!</a>
<a id='line_9337'>  They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,                      125</a>
<a id='line_9338'>  The play-fellows of fancy, who had made</a>
<a id='line_9339'>  All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength</a>
<a id='line_9340'>  Their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred</a>
<a id='line_9341'>  Among the grandest objects of the sense,</a>
<a id='line_9342'>  And dealt with whatsoever they found there                         130</a>
<a id='line_9343'>  As if they had within some lurking right</a>
<a id='line_9344'>  To wield it;--they, too, who of gentle mood</a>
<a id='line_9345'>  Had watched all gentle motions, and to these</a>
<a id='line_9346'>  Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,</a>
<a id='line_9347'>  And in the region of their peaceful selves;--135</a>
<a id='line_9348'>  Now was it that _both_ found, the meek and lofty</a>
<a id='line_9349'>  Did both find helpers to their hearts' desire,</a>
<a id='line_9350'>  And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,--</a>
<a id='line_9351'>  Were called upon to exercise their skill,</a>
<a id='line_9352'>  Not in Utopia,--subterranean fields,--140</a>
<a id='line_9353'>  Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!</a>
<a id='line_9354'>  But in the very world, which is the world</a>
<a id='line_9355'>  Of all of us,--the place where, in the end,</a>
<a id='line_9356'>  We find our happiness, or not at all!</a>
<a id='line_9357'></a>
<a id='line_9358'>    Why should I not confess that Earth was then                     145</a>
<a id='line_9359'>  To me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,</a>
<a id='line_9360'>  Seems, when the first time visited, to one</a>
<a id='line_9361'>  Who thither comes to find in it his home?</a>
<a id='line_9362'>  He walks about and looks upon the spot</a>
<a id='line_9363'>  With cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds,                    150</a>
<a id='line_9364'>  And is half pleased with things that are amiss,</a>
<a id='line_9365'>  'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.</a>
<a id='line_9366'></a>
<a id='line_9367'>    An active partisan, I thus convoked</a>
<a id='line_9368'>  From every object pleasant circumstance</a>
<a id='line_9369'>  To suit my ends; I moved among mankind                             155</a>
<a id='line_9370'>  With genial feelings still predominant;</a>
<a id='line_9371'>  When erring, erring on the better part,</a>
<a id='line_9372'>  And in the kinder spirit; placable,</a>
<a id='line_9373'>  Indulgent, as not uninformed that men</a>
<a id='line_9374'>  See as they have been taught--Antiquity                            160</a>
<a id='line_9375'>  Gives rights to error; and aware, no less,</a>
<a id='line_9376'>  That throwing off oppression must be work</a>
<a id='line_9377'>  As well of License as of Liberty;</a>
<a id='line_9378'>  And above all--for this was more than all--</a>
<a id='line_9379'>  Not caring if the wind did now and then                            165</a>
<a id='line_9380'>  Blow keen upon an eminence that gave</a>
<a id='line_9381'>  Prospect so large into futurity;</a>
<a id='line_9382'>  In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,</a>
<a id='line_9383'>  Diffusing only those affections wider</a>
<a id='line_9384'>  That from the cradle had grown up with me,                         170</a>
<a id='line_9385'>  And losing, in no other way than light</a>
<a id='line_9386'>  Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong.</a>
<a id='line_9387'></a>
<a id='line_9388'>    In the main outline, such it might be said</a>
<a id='line_9389'>  Was my condition, till with open war</a>
<a id='line_9390'>  Britain opposed the liberties of France. [E]                       175</a>
<a id='line_9391'>  This threw me first out of the pale of love;</a>
<a id='line_9392'>  Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,</a>
<a id='line_9393'>  My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,</a>
<a id='line_9394'>  A swallowing up of lesser things in great,</a>
<a id='line_9395'>  But change of them into their contraries;                          180</a>
<a id='line_9396'>  And thus a way was opened for mistakes</a>
<a id='line_9397'>  And false conclusions, in degree as gross,</a>
<a id='line_9398'>  In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,</a>
<a id='line_9399'>  Was now a shame; my likings and my loves</a>
<a id='line_9400'>  Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;                         185</a>
<a id='line_9401'>  And hence a blow that, in maturer age,</a>
<a id='line_9402'>  Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deep</a>
<a id='line_9403'>  Into sensations near the heart: meantime,</a>
<a id='line_9404'>  As from the first, wild theories were afloat,</a>
<a id='line_9405'>  To whose pretensions, sedulously urged,                            190</a>
<a id='line_9406'>  I had but lent a careless ear, assured</a>
<a id='line_9407'>  That time was ready to set all things right,</a>
<a id='line_9408'>  And that the multitude, so long oppressed,</a>
<a id='line_9409'>  Would be oppressed no more.</a>
<a id='line_9410'></a>
<a id='line_9411'>                              But when events</a>
<a id='line_9412'>  Brought less encouragement, and unto these                         195</a>
<a id='line_9413'>  The immediate proof of principles no more</a>
<a id='line_9414'>  Could be entrusted, while the events themselves,</a>
<a id='line_9415'>  Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,</a>
<a id='line_9416'>  Less occupied the mind, and sentiments</a>
<a id='line_9417'>  Could through my understanding's natural growth                    200</a>
<a id='line_9418'>  No longer keep their ground, by faith maintained</a>
<a id='line_9419'>  Of inward consciousness, and hope that laid</a>
<a id='line_9420'>  Her hand upon her object--evidence</a>
<a id='line_9421'>  Safer, of universal application, such</a>
<a id='line_9422'>  As could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.                   205</a>
<a id='line_9423'></a>
<a id='line_9424'>  But now, become oppressors in their turn,</a>
<a id='line_9425'>  Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence</a>
<a id='line_9426'>  For one of conquest, [F] losing sight of all</a>
<a id='line_9427'>  Which they had struggled for: now mounted up,</a>
<a id='line_9428'>  Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,                             210</a>
<a id='line_9429'>  The scale of liberty. I read her doom,</a>
<a id='line_9430'>  With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,</a>
<a id='line_9431'>  But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame</a>
<a id='line_9432'>  Of a false prophet. While resentment rose</a>
<a id='line_9433'>  Striving to hide, what nought could heal, the wounds               215</a>
<a id='line_9434'>  Of mortified presumption, I adhered</a>
<a id='line_9435'>  More firmly to old tenets, and, to prove</a>
<a id='line_9436'>  Their temper, strained them more; and thus, in heat</a>
<a id='line_9437'>  Of contest, did opinions every day</a>
<a id='line_9438'>  Grow into consequence, till round my mind                          220</a>
<a id='line_9439'>  They clung, as if they were its life, nay more,</a>
<a id='line_9440'>  The very being of the immortal soul.</a>
<a id='line_9441'></a>
<a id='line_9442'>    This was the time, when, all things tending fast</a>
<a id='line_9443'>  To depravation, speculative schemes--</a>
<a id='line_9444'>  That promised to abstract the hopes of Man                         225</a>
<a id='line_9445'>  Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth</a>
<a id='line_9446'>  For ever in a purer element--</a>
<a id='line_9447'>  Found ready welcome. Tempting region _that_</a>
<a id='line_9448'>  For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,</a>
<a id='line_9449'>  Where passions had the privilege to work,                          230</a>
<a id='line_9450'>  And never hear the sound of their own names.</a>
<a id='line_9451'>  But, speaking more in charity, the dream</a>
<a id='line_9452'>  Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least</a>

<a id='line_9454'>  The object of its fervour. What delight!                           235</a>
<a id='line_9455'>  How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,</a>
<a id='line_9456'>  To look through all the frailties of the world,</a>
<a id='line_9457'>  And, with a resolute mastery shaking off</a>
<a id='line_9458'>  Infirmities of nature, time, and place,</a>
<a id='line_9459'>  Build social upon personal Liberty,                                240</a>
<a id='line_9460'>  Which, to the blind restraints of general laws</a>
<a id='line_9461'>  Superior, magisterially adopts</a>
<a id='line_9462'>  One guide, the light of circumstances, flashed</a>
<a id='line_9463'>  Upon an independent intellect.</a>
<a id='line_9464'>  Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,                            245</a>
<a id='line_9465'>  From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.</a>
<a id='line_9466'>  Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,</a>
<a id='line_9467'>  I scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirst</a>
<a id='line_9468'>  Of a secure intelligence, and sick</a>
<a id='line_9469'>  Of other longing, I pursued what seemed                            250</a>
<a id='line_9470'>  A more exalted nature; wished that Man</a>
<a id='line_9471'>  Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,</a>
<a id='line_9472'>  And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,</a>
<a id='line_9473'>  Lord of himself, in undisturbed delight--</a>
<a id='line_9474'>  A noble aspiration! _yet_ I feel                                   255</a>
<a id='line_9475'>  (Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)</a>
<a id='line_9476'>  The aspiration, nor shall ever cease</a>
<a id='line_9477'>  To feel it;--but return we to our course.</a>
<a id='line_9478'></a>
<a id='line_9479'>    Enough, 'tis true--could such a plea excuse</a>
<a id='line_9480'>  Those aberrations--had the clamorous friends                       260</a>
<a id='line_9481'>  Of ancient Institutions said and done</a>
<a id='line_9482'>  To bring disgrace upon their very names;</a>
<a id='line_9483'>  Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,</a>
<a id='line_9484'>  And sundry moral sentiments as props</a>
<a id='line_9485'>  Or emanations of those institutes,                                 265</a>
<a id='line_9486'>  Too justly bore a part. A veil had been</a>
<a id='line_9487'>  Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,</a>
<a id='line_9488'>  'Twas even so; and sorrow for the man</a>
<a id='line_9489'>  Who either had not eyes wherewith to see,</a>
<a id='line_9490'>  Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock                          270</a>
<a id='line_9491'>  Was given to old opinions; all men's minds</a>
<a id='line_9492'>  Had felt its power, and mine was both let loose,</a>
<a id='line_9493'>  Let loose and goaded. After what hath been</a>
<a id='line_9494'>  Already said of patriotic love,</a>
<a id='line_9495'>  Suffice it here to add, that, somewhat stern                       275</a>
<a id='line_9496'>  In temperament, withal a happy man,</a>
<a id='line_9497'>  And therefore bold to look on painful things,</a>
<a id='line_9498'>  Free likewise of the world, and thence more bold,</a>
<a id='line_9499'>  I summoned my best skill, and toiled, intent</a>
<a id='line_9500'>  To anatomise the frame of social life,                             280</a>
<a id='line_9501'>  Yea, the whole body of society</a>
<a id='line_9502'>  Searched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wish</a>
<a id='line_9503'>  That some dramatic tale, endued with shapes</a>
<a id='line_9504'>  Livelier, and flinging out less guarded words</a>
<a id='line_9505'>  Than suit the work we fashion, might set forth                     285</a>
<a id='line_9506'>  What then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,</a>
<a id='line_9507'>  And the errors into which I fell, betrayed</a>
<a id='line_9508'>  By present objects, and by reasonings false</a>
<a id='line_9509'>  From their beginnings, inasmuch as drawn</a>
<a id='line_9510'>  Out of a heart that had been turned aside                          290</a>
<a id='line_9511'>  From Nature's way by outward accidents,</a>
<a id='line_9512'>  And which was thus confounded, more and more</a>
<a id='line_9513'>  Misguided, and misguiding. So I fared,</a>
<a id='line_9514'>  Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,</a>
<a id='line_9515'>  Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,                        295</a>
<a id='line_9516'>  Suspiciously, to establish in plain day</a>
<a id='line_9517'>  Her titles and her honours; now believing,</a>
<a id='line_9518'>  Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexed</a>
<a id='line_9519'>  With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground</a>
<a id='line_9520'>  Of obligation, what the rule and whence                            300</a>
<a id='line_9521'>  The sanction; till, demanding formal _proof_,</a>
<a id='line_9522'>  And seeking it in every thing, I lost</a>
<a id='line_9523'>  All feeling of conviction, and, in fine,</a>
<a id='line_9524'>  Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,</a>
<a id='line_9525'>  Yielded up moral questions in despair.                             305</a>
<a id='line_9526'></a>
<a id='line_9527'>  This was the crisis of that strong disease,</a>
<a id='line_9528'>  This the soul's last and lowest ebb; I drooped,</a>
<a id='line_9529'>  Deeming our blessed reason of least use</a>
<a id='line_9530'>  Where wanted most: "The lordly attributes</a>
<a id='line_9531'>  Of will and choice," I bitterly exclaimed,                         310</a>
<a id='line_9532'>  "What are they but a mockery of a Being</a>
<a id='line_9533'>  Who hath in no concerns of his a test</a>
<a id='line_9534'>  Of good and evil; knows not what to fear</a>
<a id='line_9535'>  Or hope for, what to covet or to shun;</a>
<a id='line_9536'>  And who, if those could be discerned, would yet                    315</a>
<a id='line_9537'>  Be little profited, would see, and ask</a>
<a id='line_9538'>  Where is the obligation to enforce?</a>
<a id='line_9539'>  And, to acknowledged law rebellious, still,</a>
<a id='line_9540'>  As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;</a>
<a id='line_9541'>  The dupe of folly, or the slave of crime."                         320</a>
<a id='line_9542'></a>
<a id='line_9543'>    Depressed, bewildered thus, I did not walk</a>
<a id='line_9544'>  With scoffers, seeking light and gay revenge</a>
<a id='line_9545'>  From indiscriminate laughter, nor sate down</a>
<a id='line_9546'>  In reconcilement with an utter waste</a>
<a id='line_9547'>  Of intellect; such sloth I could not brook,                        325</a>
<a id='line_9548'>  (Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,</a>
<a id='line_9549'>  Pains-taking thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)</a>
<a id='line_9550'>  But turned to abstract science, and there sought</a>
<a id='line_9551'>  Work for the reasoning faculty enthroned</a>
<a id='line_9552'>  Where the disturbances of space and time--330</a>
<a id='line_9553'>  Whether in matters various, properties</a>
<a id='line_9554'>  Inherent, or from human will and power</a>
<a id='line_9555'>  Derived--find no admission. [G] Then it was--</a>
<a id='line_9556'>  Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!--</a>
<a id='line_9557'>  That the beloved Sister in whose sight                             335</a>
<a id='line_9558'>  Those days were passed, [H] now speaking in a voice</a>
<a id='line_9559'>  Of sudden admonition--like a brook [I]</a>

<a id='line_9561'>  Is seen, heard, felt, and caught at every turn,</a>
<a id='line_9562'>  Companion never lost through many a league--340</a>
<a id='line_9563'>  Maintained for me a saving intercourse</a>
<a id='line_9564'>  With my true self; for, though bedimmed and changed</a>
<a id='line_9565'>  Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed</a>
<a id='line_9566'>  Than as a clouded and a waning moon:</a>
<a id='line_9567'>  She whispered still that brightness would return,                  345</a>
<a id='line_9568'>  She, in the midst of all, preserved me still</a>
<a id='line_9569'>  A Poet, made me seek beneath that name,</a>
<a id='line_9570'>  And that alone, my office upon earth;</a>
<a id='line_9571'>  And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,</a>
<a id='line_9572'>  If willing audience fail not, Nature's self,                       350</a>
<a id='line_9573'>  By all varieties of human love</a>
<a id='line_9574'>  Assisted, led me back through opening day</a>
<a id='line_9575'>  To those sweet counsels between head and heart</a>
<a id='line_9576'>  Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,</a>
<a id='line_9577'>  Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,                   355</a>
<a id='line_9578'>  Hath still upheld me, and upholds me now</a>
<a id='line_9579'>  In the catastrophe (for so they dream,</a>
<a id='line_9580'>  And nothing less), when, finally to close</a>
<a id='line_9581'>  And seal up all the gains of France, a Pope</a>
<a id='line_9582'>  Is summoned in, to crown an Emperor--[K]                           360</a>
<a id='line_9583'>  This last opprobrium, when we see a people,</a>
<a id='line_9584'>  That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven</a>
<a id='line_9585'>  For manna, take a lesson from the dog</a>
<a id='line_9586'>  Returning to his vomit; when the sun</a>
<a id='line_9587'>  That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved                       365</a>
<a id='line_9588'>  In exultation with a living pomp</a>
<a id='line_9589'>  Of clouds--his glory's natural retinue--</a>
<a id='line_9590'>  Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,</a>
<a id='line_9591'>  And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine,</a>
<a id='line_9592'>  Sets like an Opera phantom.</a>
<a id='line_9593'>                              Thus, O Friend!                        370</a>
<a id='line_9594'>  Through times of honour and through times of shame</a>
<a id='line_9595'>  Descending, have I faithfully retraced</a>
<a id='line_9596'>  The perturbations of a youthful mind</a>
<a id='line_9597'>  Under a long-lived storm of great events--</a>
<a id='line_9598'>  A story destined for thy ear, who now,                             375</a>
<a id='line_9599'>  Among the fallen of nations, dost abide</a>
<a id='line_9600'>  Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts</a>

<a id='line_9609'>  Have been distressed to think of what she once</a>
<a id='line_9610'>  Promised, now is; a far more sober cause</a>
<a id='line_9611'>  Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land.</a>
<a id='line_9612'>  To the reanimating influence lost</a>
<a id='line_9613'>  Of memory, to virtue lost and hope,                                390</a>

<a id='line_9623'>  To health and joy and pure contentedness;</a>
<a id='line_9624'>  To me the grief confined, that thou art gone</a>
<a id='line_9625'>  From this last spot of earth, where Freedom now                    400</a>

<a id='line_9627'>  A lonely wanderer art gone, by pain</a>
<a id='line_9628'>  Compelled and sickness, [N] at this latter day,</a>
<a id='line_9629'>  This sorrowful reverse for all mankind.</a>
<a id='line_9630'>  I feel for thee, must utter what I feel:                           405</a>
<a id='line_9631'>  The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,</a>
<a id='line_9632'>  Gather afresh, and will have vent again:</a>
<a id='line_9633'>  My own delights do scarcely seem to me</a>
<a id='line_9634'>  My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,</a>
<a id='line_9635'>  Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks                     410</a>
<a id='line_9636'>  Abroad on many nations, are no more</a>

<a id='line_9668'>  When thinking on my own beloved friend,</a>
<a id='line_9669'>  I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed</a>

<a id='line_9672'>  Laden from blooming grove or flowery field,</a>
<a id='line_9673'>  And fed him there, alive, month after month,</a>
<a id='line_9674'>  Because the goatherd, blessed man! had lips</a>

<a id='line_9676'>                              Thus I soothe</a>

<a id='line_9829'>  Detained us, on what spectacles of woe</a>
<a id='line_9830'>  Compelled to look, and inwardly oppressed</a>
<a id='line_9831'>  With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,</a>

<a id='line_9836'>  Ye motions of delight, that haunt the sides</a>
<a id='line_9837'>  Of the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,                       10</a>
<a id='line_9838'>  Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,</a>
<a id='line_9839'>  Feelingly watched, might teach Man's haughty race</a>
<a id='line_9840'>  How without injury to take, to give</a>
<a id='line_9841'>  Without offence [A]; ye who, as if to show</a>
<a id='line_9842'>  The wondrous influence of power gently used,                        15</a>
<a id='line_9843'>  Bend the complying heads of lordly pines,</a>

<a id='line_9850'>  Not mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;</a>
<a id='line_9851'>  And you, ye groves, whose ministry it is</a>
<a id='line_9852'>  To interpose the covert of your shades,                             25</a>
<a id='line_9853'>  Even as a sleep, between the heart of man</a>
<a id='line_9854'>  And outward troubles, between man himself,</a>
<a id='line_9855'>  Not seldom, and his own uneasy heart:</a>
<a id='line_9856'>  Oh! that I had a music and a voice</a>
<a id='line_9857'>  Harmonious as your own, that I might tell                           30</a>
<a id='line_9858'>  What ye have done for me. The morning shines,</a>
<a id='line_9859'>  Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns,--</a>
<a id='line_9860'>  I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,</a>
<a id='line_9861'>  In common with the children of her love,</a>
<a id='line_9862'>  Piping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,                      35</a>
<a id='line_9863'>  Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven</a>
<a id='line_9864'>  On wings that navigate cerulean skies.</a>
<a id='line_9865'>  So neither were complacency, nor peace,</a>
<a id='line_9866'>  Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my good</a>
<a id='line_9867'>  Through these distracted times; in Nature still                     40</a>
<a id='line_9868'>  Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,</a>
<a id='line_9869'>  Which, when the spirit of evil reached its height.</a>
<a id='line_9870'>  Maintained for me a secret happiness.</a>
<a id='line_9871'></a>
<a id='line_9872'>    This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly told</a>
<a id='line_9873'>  Of intellectual power, fostering love,                              45</a>
<a id='line_9874'>  Dispensing truth, and, over men and things,</a>
<a id='line_9875'>  Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusing</a>
<a id='line_9876'>  Prophetic sympathies of genial faith:</a>
<a id='line_9877'>  So was I favoured--such my happy lot--</a>
<a id='line_9878'>  Until that natural graciousness of mind                             50</a>
<a id='line_9879'>  Gave way to overpressure from the times</a>
<a id='line_9880'>  And their disastrous issues. What availed,</a>
<a id='line_9881'>  When spells forbade the voyager to land,</a>
<a id='line_9882'>  That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore</a>
<a id='line_9883'>  Wafted, at intervals, from many a bower                             55</a>
<a id='line_9884'>  Of blissful gratitude and fearless love?</a>
<a id='line_9885'>  Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,</a>
<a id='line_9886'>  And hope that future times _would_ surely see,</a>
<a id='line_9887'>  The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,</a>
<a id='line_9888'>  From him who had been; that I could no more                         60</a>
<a id='line_9889'>  Trust the elevation which had made me one</a>
<a id='line_9890'>  With the great family that still survives</a>
<a id='line_9891'>  To illuminate the abyss of ages past,</a>
<a id='line_9892'>  Sage, warrior, patriot, hero; for it seemed</a>
<a id='line_9893'>  That their best virtues were not free from taint                    65</a>
<a id='line_9894'>  Of something false and weak, that could not stand</a>
<a id='line_9895'>  The open eye of Reason. Then I said,</a>
<a id='line_9896'>  "Go to the Poets, they will speak to thee</a>
<a id='line_9897'>  More perfectly of purer creatures;--yet</a>
<a id='line_9898'>  If reason be nobility in man,                                       70</a>
<a id='line_9899'>  Can aught be more ignoble than the man</a>
<a id='line_9900'>  Whom they delight in, blinded as he is</a>
<a id='line_9901'>  By prejudice, the miserable slave</a>
<a id='line_9902'>  Of low ambition or distempered love?"</a>
<a id='line_9903'></a>
<a id='line_9904'>    In such strange passion, if I may once more                       75</a>
<a id='line_9905'>  Review the past, I warred against myself--</a>
<a id='line_9906'>  A bigot to a new idolatry--</a>
<a id='line_9907'>  Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,</a>
<a id='line_9908'>  Zealously laboured to cut off my heart</a>
<a id='line_9909'>  From all the sources of her former strength;                        80</a>
<a id='line_9910'>  And as, by simple waving of a wand,</a>
<a id='line_9911'>  The wizard instantaneously dissolves</a>
<a id='line_9912'>  Palace or grove, even so could I unsoul</a>
<a id='line_9913'>  As readily by syllogistic words</a>
<a id='line_9914'>  Those mysteries of being which have made,                           85</a>
<a id='line_9915'>  And shall continue evermore to make,</a>
<a id='line_9916'>  Of the whole human race one brotherhood.</a>
<a id='line_9917'></a>
<a id='line_9918'>    What wonder, then, if, to a mind so far</a>
<a id='line_9919'>  Perverted, even the visible Universe</a>
<a id='line_9920'>  Fell under the dominion of a taste                                  90</a>
<a id='line_9921'>  Less spiritual, with microscopic view</a>
<a id='line_9922'>  Was scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?</a>
<a id='line_9923'></a>
<a id='line_9924'>    O Soul of Nature! excellent and fair!</a>
<a id='line_9925'>  That didst rejoice with me, with whom I, too,</a>
<a id='line_9926'>  Rejoiced through early youth, before the winds                      95</a>
<a id='line_9927'>  And roaring waters, and in lights and shades</a>
<a id='line_9928'>  That marched and countermarched about the hills</a>
<a id='line_9929'>  In glorious apparition, Powers on whom</a>
<a id='line_9930'>  I daily waited, now all eye and now</a>
<a id='line_9931'>  All ear; but never long without the heart                          100</a>
<a id='line_9932'>  Employed, and man's unfolding intellect:</a>
<a id='line_9933'>  O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divine</a>
<a id='line_9934'>  Sustained and governed, still dost overflow</a>
<a id='line_9935'>  With an impassioned life, what feeble ones</a>
<a id='line_9936'>  Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been                         105</a>
<a id='line_9937'>  When thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through stroke</a>
<a id='line_9938'>  Of human suffering, such as justifies</a>
<a id='line_9939'>  Remissness and inaptitude of mind,</a>
<a id='line_9940'>  But through presumption; even in pleasure pleased</a>
<a id='line_9941'>  Unworthily, disliking here, and there                              110</a>
<a id='line_9942'>  Liking; by rules of mimic art transferred</a>
<a id='line_9943'>  To things above all art; but more,--for this,</a>
<a id='line_9944'>  Although a strong infection of the age,</a>
<a id='line_9945'>  Was never much my habit--giving way</a>
<a id='line_9946'>  To a comparison of scene with scene,                               115</a>
<a id='line_9947'>  Bent overmuch on superficial things,</a>
<a id='line_9948'>  Pampering myself with meagre novelties</a>
<a id='line_9949'>  Of colour and proportion; to the moods</a>
<a id='line_9950'>  Of time and season, to the moral power,</a>
<a id='line_9951'>  The affections and the spirit of the place,                        120</a>
<a id='line_9952'>  Insensible. Nor only did the love</a>
<a id='line_9953'>  Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt</a>
<a id='line_9954'>  My deeper feelings, but another cause,</a>
<a id='line_9955'>  More subtle and less easily explained,</a>
<a id='line_9956'>  That almost seems inherent in the creature,                        125</a>
<a id='line_9957'>  A twofold frame of body and of mind.</a>
<a id='line_9958'>  I speak in recollection of a time</a>
<a id='line_9959'>  When the bodily eye, in every stage of life</a>
<a id='line_9960'>  The most despotic of our senses, gained</a>
<a id='line_9961'>  Such strength in _me_ as often held my mind                        130</a>
<a id='line_9962'>  In absolute dominion. Gladly here,</a>
<a id='line_9963'>  Entering upon abstruser argument,</a>
<a id='line_9964'>  Could I endeavour to unfold the means</a>
<a id='line_9965'>  Which Nature studiously employs to thwart</a>
<a id='line_9966'>  This tyranny, summons all the senses each                          135</a>
<a id='line_9967'>  To counteract the other, and themselves,</a>
<a id='line_9968'>  And makes them all, and the objects with which all</a>
<a id='line_9969'>  Are conversant, subservient in their turn</a>
<a id='line_9970'>  To the great ends of Liberty and Power.</a>
<a id='line_9971'>  But leave we this: enough that my delights                         140</a>
<a id='line_9972'>  (Such as they were) were sought insatiably.</a>
<a id='line_9973'>  Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound;</a>
<a id='line_9974'>  I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock,</a>
<a id='line_9975'>  Still craving combinations of new forms,</a>
<a id='line_9976'>  New pleasure, wider empire for the sight,                          145</a>
<a id='line_9977'>  Proud of her own endowments, and rejoiced</a>
<a id='line_9978'>  To lay the inner faculties asleep.</a>
<a id='line_9979'>  Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife</a>
<a id='line_9980'>  And various trials of our complex being,</a>
<a id='line_9981'>  As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense                         150</a>
<a id='line_9982'>  Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid, [B]</a>
<a id='line_9983'>  A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds;</a>
<a id='line_9984'>  Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;</a>
<a id='line_9985'>  Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,</a>
<a id='line_9986'>  Or barren intermeddling subtleties,                                155</a>
<a id='line_9987'>  Perplex her mind; but, wise as women are</a>
<a id='line_9988'>  When genial circumstance hath favoured them,</a>
<a id='line_9989'>  She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;</a>
<a id='line_9990'>  Whate'er the scene presented to her view,</a>
<a id='line_9991'>  That was the best, to that she was attuned                         160</a>
<a id='line_9992'>  By her benign simplicity of life,</a>
<a id='line_9993'>  And through a perfect happiness of soul,</a>
<a id='line_9994'>  Whose variegated feelings were in this</a>
<a id='line_9995'>  Sisters, that they were each some new delight.</a>
<a id='line_9996'>  Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,                  165</a>
<a id='line_9997'>  Could they have known her, would have loved; methought</a>
<a id='line_9998'>  Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,</a>
<a id='line_9999'>  That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,</a>
<a id='line_10000'>  And every thing she looked on, should have had</a>
<a id='line_10001'>  An intimation how she bore herself                                 170</a>
<a id='line_10002'>  Towards them and to all creatures. God delights</a>
<a id='line_10003'>  In such a being; for her common thoughts</a>
<a id='line_10004'>  Are piety, her life is gratitude.</a>
<a id='line_10005'></a>

<a id='line_10066'>  Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor</a>
<a id='line_10067'>  I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length</a>
<a id='line_10068'>  Came to a bottom, where in former times                            235</a>
<a id='line_10069'>  A murderer had been hung in iron chains.</a>

<a id='line_10120'>  Of these memorials;--</a>
<a id='line_10121'>                        One Christmas-time, [F]</a>
<a id='line_10122'>  On the glad eve of its dear holidays,</a>
<a id='line_10123'>  Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth</a>
<a id='line_10124'>  Into the fields, impatient for the sight                           290</a>
<a id='line_10125'>  Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;</a>
<a id='line_10126'>  My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,</a>
<a id='line_10127'>  That, from the meeting-point of two highways [F]</a>
<a id='line_10128'>  Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched;</a>
<a id='line_10129'>  Thither, uncertain on which road to fix                            295</a>
<a id='line_10130'>  My expectation, thither I repaired,</a>
<a id='line_10131'>  Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day</a>
<a id='line_10132'>  Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass</a>
<a id='line_10133'>  I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;</a>
<a id='line_10134'>  Upon my right hand couched a single sheep,                         300</a>
<a id='line_10135'>  Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;</a>
<a id='line_10136'>  With those companions at my side, I watched,</a>
<a id='line_10137'>  Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist</a>
<a id='line_10138'>  Gave intermitting prospect of the copse</a>
<a id='line_10139'>  And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,--305</a>
<a id='line_10140'>  That dreary time,--ere we had been ten days</a>
<a id='line_10141'>  Sojourners in my father's house, he died,</a>
<a id='line_10142'>  And I and my three brothers, orphans then,</a>
<a id='line_10143'>  Followed his body to the grave. The event,</a>
<a id='line_10144'>  With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared                      310</a>
<a id='line_10145'>  A chastisement; and when I called to mind</a>
<a id='line_10146'>  That day so lately past, when from the crag</a>
<a id='line_10147'>  I looked in such anxiety of hope;</a>
<a id='line_10148'>  With trite reflections of morality,</a>
<a id='line_10149'>  Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low                            315</a>
<a id='line_10150'>  To God, Who thus corrected my desires;</a>
<a id='line_10151'>  And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,</a>
<a id='line_10152'>  And all the business of the elements,</a>
<a id='line_10153'>  The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,</a>
<a id='line_10154'>  And the bleak music from that old stone wall,                      320</a>
<a id='line_10155'>  The noise of wood and water, and the mist</a>
<a id='line_10156'>  That on the line of each of those two roads</a>
<a id='line_10157'>  Advanced in such indisputable shapes;</a>
<a id='line_10158'>  All these were kindred spectacles and sounds</a>
<a id='line_10159'>  To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,                   325</a>
<a id='line_10160'>  As at a fountain; and on winter nights,</a>
<a id='line_10161'>  Down to this very time, when storm and rain</a>
<a id='line_10162'>  Beat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,</a>
<a id='line_10163'>  While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,</a>

<a id='line_10165'>  In a strong wind, some working of the spirit,</a>

<a id='line_10194'>[Footnote F: The year was evidently 1783, but the locality is difficult</a>
<a id='line_10195'>to determine. It may have been one or other of two places. Wordsworth's</a>
<a id='line_10196'>father died at Penrith, and it was there that the sons went for their</a>
<a id='line_10197'>Christmas holiday. The road from Penrith to Hawkshead was by Kirkstone</a>
<a id='line_10198'>Pass, and Ambleside; and the "led palfreys" sent to take the boys home</a>
<a id='line_10199'>would certainly come through the latter town. Now there are only two</a>
<a id='line_10200'>roads from Ambleside to Hawkshead, which meet at a point about a mile</a>
<a id='line_10201'>north of Hawkshead, called in the Ordnance map "Outgate." The eastern</a>
<a id='line_10202'>road is now chiefly used by carriages, being less hilly and better made</a>
<a id='line_10203'>than the western one. The latter would be quite as convenient as the</a>
<a id='line_10204'>former for horses. If one were to walk out from Hawkshead village to the</a>
<a id='line_10205'>place where the two roads separate at "Outgate," and then ascend the</a>
<a id='line_10206'>ridge between them, he would find several places from which he could</a>
<a id='line_10207'>overlook _both_ roads "far stretched," were the view not now intercepted</a>
<a id='line_10208'>by numerous plantations. (The latter are of comparatively recent</a>
<a id='line_10209'>growth.) Dr. Cradock,--to whom I am indebted for this, and for many</a>
<a id='line_10210'>other suggestions as to localities alluded to by Wordsworth,--thinks</a>
<a id='line_10211'>that</a>
<a id='line_10212'></a>
<a id='line_10213'>  "a point, marked on the map as 'High Crag' between the two roads, and</a>
<a id='line_10214'>  about three-quarters of a mile from their point of divergence, answers</a>
<a id='line_10215'>  the description as well as any other. It may be nearly two miles from</a>
<a id='line_10216'>  Hawkshead, a distance of which an active eager school-boy would think</a>
<a id='line_10217'>  nothing. The 'blasted hawthorn' and the 'naked wall' are probably</a>
<a id='line_10218'>  things of the past as much as the 'single sheep.'"</a>
<a id='line_10219'></a>
<a id='line_10220'>Doubtless this may be the spot,--a green, rocky knoll with a steep face</a>
<a id='line_10221'>to the north, where a quarry is wrought, and with a plantation to the</a>
<a id='line_10222'>east. It commands a view of both roads. The other possible place is a</a>
<a id='line_10223'>crag, not a quarter of a mile from Outgate, a little to the right of the</a>
<a id='line_10224'>place where the two roads divide. A low wall runs up across it to the</a>
<a id='line_10225'>top, dividing a plantation of oak, hazel, and ash, from the firs that</a>
<a id='line_10226'>crown the summit. These firs, which are larch and spruce, seem all of</a>
<a id='line_10227'>this century. The top of the crag may have been bare when Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_10228'>lived at Hawkshead. But at the foot of the path along the dividing wall</a>
<a id='line_10229'>there are a few (probably older) trees; and a solitary walk beneath</a>
<a id='line_10230'>them, at noon or dusk, is almost as suggestive to the imagination, as</a>
<a id='line_10231'>repose under the yews of Borrowdale, listening to "the mountain flood"</a>
<a id='line_10232'>on Glaramara. There one may still hear the bleak music from the old</a>
<a id='line_10233'>stone wall, and "the noise of wood and water," while the loud dry wind</a>
<a id='line_10234'>whistles through the underwood, or moans amid the fir trees of the Crag,</a>
<a id='line_10235'>on the summit of which there is a "blasted hawthorn" tree. It may be</a>
<a id='line_10236'>difficult now to determine the precise spot to which the boy Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_10237'>climbed on that eventful day--afterwards so significant to him, and from</a>
<a id='line_10238'>the events of which, he says, he drank "as at a fountain"--but I think</a>
<a id='line_10239'>it may have been to one or other of these two crags. (See, however, Mr.</a>

<a id='line_10694'>[Footnote C: For a hint in reference to this road, I am indebted to the</a>
<a id='line_10695'>late Dr. Henry Dodgson of Cockermouth. Referring to my suggestion that</a>
<a id='line_10696'>it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk, he wrote (July</a>
<a id='line_10697'>1878),</a>
<a id='line_10698'></a>
<a id='line_10699'>  "I scarcely think that road answers to the description. The hill over</a>
<a id='line_10700'>  which it goes is not naked but well wooded, and has probably been so</a>
<a id='line_10701'>  for many years. Besides, it is not visible from Wordsworth's house,</a>
<a id='line_10702'>  nor from the garden behind it. This garden extends from the house to</a>
<a id='line_10703'>  the river Derwent, from which it is separated by a wall, with a raised</a>
<a id='line_10704'>  terraced walk on the inner side, and nearly on a level with the top. I</a>
<a id='line_10705'>  understand that this terrace was in existence in the poet's time....</a>
<a id='line_10706'>  Its direction is nearly due east and west; and looking eastward from</a>
<a id='line_10707'>  it, there is a hill which bounds the view in that direction, and which</a>
<a id='line_10708'>  fully corresponds to the description in 'The Prelude'. It is from one</a>
<a id='line_10709'>  and a half to two miles distant, of considerable height, is bare and</a>
<a id='line_10710'>  destitute of trees, and has a road going directly over its summit, as</a>
<a id='line_10711'>  seen from the terrace in Wordsworth's garden. This road is now used</a>
<a id='line_10712'>  only as a footpath; but, fifty or sixty years ago it was the highroad</a>
<a id='line_10713'>  to Isel, a hamlet on the Derwent, about three and a half miles from</a>
<a id='line_10714'>  Cockermouth, in the direction of Bassenthwaite Lake. The hill is</a>
<a id='line_10715'>  locally called 'the Hay,' but on the Ordnance map it is marked 'Watch</a>
<a id='line_10716'>  Hill.'"</a>
<a id='line_10717'></a>
<a id='line_10718'>There can be little doubt as to the accuracy of this suggestion. No</a>
<a id='line_10719'>other hill-road is visible from the house or garden at Cockermouth. The</a>
<a id='line_10720'>view from the front of the old mansion is limited by houses, doubtless</a>
<a id='line_10721'>more so now than in last century; but there is no hill towards the</a>
<a id='line_10722'>Lorton Fells on the south or south-east, with a road over it, visible</a>
<a id='line_10723'>from any part of the town. Besides, as this was a very early experience</a>
<a id='line_10724'>of Wordsworth's--it was in "the morn of childhood" that the road was</a>
<a id='line_10725'>"daily present to his sight"--it must have been seen, either from the</a>
<a id='line_10726'>house or from the garden. It is almost certain that he refers to the</a>
<a id='line_10727'>path over the Hay or Watch Hill, which he and his "sister Emmeline"</a>
<a id='line_10728'>could see daily from the high terrace, at the foot of their garden in</a>
<a id='line_10729'>Cockermouth, where they used to "chase the butterfly" and visit the</a>
<a id='line_10730'>"sparrow's nest" in the "impervious shelter" of privet and roses.</a>

<a id='line_10732'>Dr. Cradock wrote to me (January 1886),</a>

<a id='line_10735'>  dated 1789, entirely confirms Dr. Dodgson's statement. The road over</a>
<a id='line_10736'>  'Hay Hill' is marked clearly as a carriage road to Isel. The miles are</a>
<a id='line_10737'>  marked on the map. The 'summit' of the hill is 'naked': for the map</a>

<a id='line_10800'>  But, undiscouraged, we began to climb</a>
<a id='line_10801'>  The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,                     15</a>
<a id='line_10802'>  And, after ordinary travellers' talk</a>
<a id='line_10803'>  With our conductor, pensively we sank</a>
<a id='line_10804'>  Each into commerce with his private thoughts:</a>

<a id='line_10808'>  The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,</a>

<a id='line_10810'>  His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.</a>
<a id='line_10811'>  This small adventure, for even such it seemed                       25</a>
<a id='line_10812'>  In that wild place and at the dead of night,</a>
<a id='line_10813'>  Being over and forgotten, on we wound</a>
<a id='line_10814'>  In silence as before. With forehead bent</a>
<a id='line_10815'>  Earthward, as if in opposition set</a>
<a id='line_10816'>  Against an enemy, I panted up                                       30</a>

<a id='line_11125'>  Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,</a>

<a id='line_11128'>  Amid conflicting interests, and the shock</a>
<a id='line_11129'>  Of various tempers; to endure and note                             335</a>
<a id='line_11130'>  What was not understood, though known to be;</a>

<a id='line_11135'>  Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called</a>
<a id='line_11136'>  To take a station among men, the step</a>

<a id='line_11173'>  I said unto the life which I had lived,</a>

<a id='line_11346'>The following extract from a letter of Wordsworth's to Sir George</a>
<a id='line_11347'>Beaumont, dated October 17, 1805, will cast light on the next three</a>
<a id='line_11348'>sonnets.</a>
<a id='line_11349'></a>
<a id='line_11350'>  "I mentioned Michael Angelo's poetry some time ago; it is the most</a>
<a id='line_11351'>  difficult to construe I ever met with, but just what you would expect</a>
<a id='line_11352'>  from such a man, shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with</a>
<a id='line_11353'>  great things. There is a mistake in the world concerning the Italian</a>
<a id='line_11354'>  language; the poetry of Dante and Michael Angelo proves, that if there</a>
<a id='line_11355'>  be little majesty and strength in Italian verse, the fault is in the</a>
<a id='line_11356'>  authors, and not in the tongue. I can translate, and have translated</a>
<a id='line_11357'>  two books of Ariosto, at the rate, nearly, of one hundred lines a day;</a>
<a id='line_11358'>  but so much meaning has been put by Michael Angelo into so little</a>
<a id='line_11359'>  room, and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself, that I found</a>
<a id='line_11360'>  the difficulty of translating him insurmountable. I attempted, at</a>
<a id='line_11361'>  least, fifteen of the sonnets, but could not anywhere succeed. I have</a>
<a id='line_11362'>  sent you the only one I was able to finish; it is far from being the</a>
<a id='line_11363'>  best, or most characteristic, but the others were too much for me."</a>
<a id='line_11364'></a>
<a id='line_11365'>The last of the three sonnets probably belongs to the year 1804, as it</a>
<a id='line_11366'>is quoted in a letter to Sir George Beaumont, dated Grasmere, August 6.</a>
<a id='line_11367'>The year is not given, but I think it must have been 1804, as he says</a>
<a id='line_11368'>that "within the last month," he had written, "700 additional lines" of</a>
<a id='line_11369'>'The Prelude'; and that poem was finished in May 1805.</a>
<a id='line_11370'></a>
