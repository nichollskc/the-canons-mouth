<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>Enter a company of mutinous citizens, with staves, clubs, and other</a>
<a id='line_41'>weapons</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</a>
<a id='line_44'>  ALL. Speak, speak.</a>
<a id='line_45'>  FIRST CITIZEN. YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?</a>
<a id='line_46'>  ALL. Resolv'd, resolv'd.</a>
<a id='line_47'>  FIRST CITIZEN. First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the</a>
<a id='line_48'>    people.</a>
<a id='line_49'>  ALL. We know't, we know't.</a>
<a id='line_50'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own</a>
<a id='line_51'>    price. Is't a verdict?</a>
<a id='line_52'>  ALL. No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!</a>
<a id='line_53'>  SECOND CITIZEN. One word, good citizens.</a>
<a id='line_54'>  FIRST CITIZEN. We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.</a>
<a id='line_55'>    What authority surfeits on would relieve us; if they would yield</a>
<a id='line_56'>    us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess</a>
<a id='line_57'>    they relieved us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The</a>
<a id='line_58'>    leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an</a>
<a id='line_59'>    inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a</a>
<a id='line_60'>    gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become</a>
<a id='line_61'>    rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in</a>
<a id='line_62'>    thirst for revenge.</a>
<a id='line_63'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?</a>
<a id='line_64'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Against him first; he's a very dog to the</a>
<a id='line_65'>    commonalty.</a>
<a id='line_66'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Consider you what services he has done for his</a>
<a id='line_67'>    country?</a>
<a id='line_68'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Very well, and could be content to give him good</a>
<a id='line_69'>    report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.</a>
<a id='line_70'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Nay, but speak not maliciously.</a>
<a id='line_71'>  FIRST CITIZEN. I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it</a>
<a id='line_72'>    to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it</a>
<a id='line_73'>    was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be</a>
<a id='line_74'>    partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.</a>
<a id='line_75'>  SECOND CITIZEN. What he cannot help in his nature you account a</a>
<a id='line_76'>    vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</a>
<a id='line_77'>  FIRST CITIZEN. If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;</a>
<a id='line_78'>    he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts</a>
<a id='line_79'>    within]  What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is</a>
<a id='line_80'>    risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!</a>
<a id='line_81'>  ALL. Come, come.</a>
<a id='line_82'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Soft! who comes here?</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>                       Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>  SECOND CITIZEN. Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd</a>
<a id='line_87'>    the people.</a>
<a id='line_88'>  FIRST CITIZEN. He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!</a>
<a id='line_89'>  MENENIUS. What work's, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you</a>
<a id='line_90'>    With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.</a>
<a id='line_91'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have</a>
<a id='line_92'>    had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll</a>
<a id='line_93'>    show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths;</a>
<a id='line_94'>    they shall know we have strong arms too.</a>
<a id='line_95'>  MENENIUS. Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,</a>
<a id='line_96'>    Will you undo yourselves?</a>
<a id='line_97'>  FIRST CITIZEN. We cannot, sir; we are undone already.</a>
<a id='line_98'>  MENENIUS. I tell you, friends, most charitable care</a>
<a id='line_99'>    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</a>
<a id='line_100'>    Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</a>
<a id='line_101'>    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</a>
<a id='line_102'>    Against the Roman state; whose course will on</a>
<a id='line_103'>    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</a>
<a id='line_104'>    Of more strong link asunder than can ever</a>
<a id='line_105'>    Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</a>
<a id='line_106'>    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</a>
<a id='line_107'>    Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</a>
<a id='line_108'>    You are transported by calamity</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Thither where more attends you; and you slander</a>
<a id='line_110'>    The helms o' th' state, who care for you like fathers,</a>
<a id='line_111'>    When you curse them as enemies.</a>
<a id='line_112'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us</a>
<a id='line_113'>    yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with</a>
<a id='line_114'>    grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily</a>
<a id='line_115'>    any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more</a>
<a id='line_116'>    piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the</a>
<a id='line_117'>    wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear</a>
<a id='line_118'>    us.</a>
<a id='line_119'>  MENENIUS. Either you must</a>
<a id='line_120'>    Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</a>
<a id='line_121'>    Or be accus'd of folly. I shall tell you</a>
<a id='line_122'>    A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;</a>
<a id='line_123'>    But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</a>
<a id='line_124'>    To stale't a little more.</a>
<a id='line_125'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to</a>
<a id='line_126'>    fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.</a>
<a id='line_127'>  MENENIUS. There was a time when all the body's members</a>
<a id='line_128'>    Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:</a>
<a id='line_129'>    That only like a gulf it did remain</a>
<a id='line_130'>    I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive,</a>
<a id='line_131'>    Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</a>
<a id='line_132'>    Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments</a>
<a id='line_133'>    Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</a>
<a id='line_134'>    And, mutually participate, did minister</a>
<a id='line_135'>    Unto the appetite and affection common</a>
<a id='line_136'>    Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-</a>
<a id='line_137'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</a>
<a id='line_138'>  MENENIUS. Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</a>
<a id='line_139'>    Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-</a>
<a id='line_140'>    For look you, I may make the belly smile</a>
<a id='line_141'>    As well as speak- it tauntingly replied</a>
<a id='line_142'>    To th' discontented members, the mutinous parts</a>
<a id='line_143'>    That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</a>
<a id='line_144'>    As you malign our senators for that</a>
<a id='line_145'>    They are not such as you.</a>
<a id='line_146'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Your belly's answer- What?</a>
<a id='line_147'>    The kingly crowned head, the vigilant eye,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</a>
<a id='line_149'>    Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,</a>
<a id='line_150'>    With other muniments and petty helps</a>
<a id='line_151'>    Is this our fabric, if that they-</a>
<a id='line_152'>  MENENIUS. What then?</a>
<a id='line_153'>    Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?</a>
<a id='line_154'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,</a>
<a id='line_155'>    Who is the sink o' th' body-</a>
<a id='line_156'>  MENENIUS. Well, what then?</a>
<a id='line_157'>  FIRST CITIZEN. The former agents, if they did complain,</a>
<a id='line_158'>    What could the belly answer?</a>
<a id='line_159'>  MENENIUS. I will tell you;</a>
<a id='line_160'>    If you'll bestow a small- of what you have little-</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Patience awhile, you'st hear the belly's answer.</a>
<a id='line_162'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Y'are long about it.</a>
<a id='line_163'>  MENENIUS. Note me this, good friend:</a>
<a id='line_164'>    Your most grave belly was deliberate,</a>
<a id='line_165'>    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.</a>
<a id='line_166'>    'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he</a>
<a id='line_167'>    'That I receive the general food at first</a>
<a id='line_168'>    Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Because I am the storehouse and the shop</a>
<a id='line_170'>    Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,</a>
<a id='line_171'>    I send it through the rivers of your blood,</a>
<a id='line_172'>    Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain;</a>
<a id='line_173'>    And, through the cranks and offices of man,</a>
<a id='line_174'>    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</a>
<a id='line_175'>    From me receive that natural competency</a>
<a id='line_176'>    Whereby they live. And though that all at once</a>
<a id='line_177'>    You, my good friends'- this says the belly; mark me.</a>
<a id='line_178'>  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, sir; well, well.</a>
<a id='line_179'>  MENENIUS. 'Though all at once cannot</a>
<a id='line_180'>    See what I do deliver out to each,</a>
<a id='line_181'>    Yet I can make my audit up, that all</a>
<a id='line_182'>    From me do back receive the flour of all,</a>
<a id='line_183'>    And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?</a>
<a id='line_184'>  FIRST CITIZEN. It was an answer. How apply you this?</a>
<a id='line_185'>  MENENIUS. The senators of Rome are this good belly,</a>
<a id='line_186'>    And you the mutinous members; for, examine</a>
<a id='line_187'>    Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly</a>
<a id='line_188'>    Touching the weal o' th' common, you shall find</a>
<a id='line_189'>    No public benefit which you receive</a>
<a id='line_190'>    But it proceeds or comes from them to you,</a>
<a id='line_191'>    And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</a>
<a id='line_192'>    You, the great toe of this assembly?</a>
<a id='line_193'>  FIRST CITIZEN. I the great toe? Why the great toe?</a>
<a id='line_194'>  MENENIUS. For that, being one o' th' lowest, basest, poorest,</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost.</a>
<a id='line_196'>    Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Lead'st first to win some vantage.</a>
<a id='line_198'>    But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs.</a>
<a id='line_199'>    Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;</a>
<a id='line_200'>    The one side must have bale.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>                      Enter CAIUS MARCIUS</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>    Hail, noble Marcius!</a>
<a id='line_205'>  MARCIUS. Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues</a>
<a id='line_206'>    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</a>
<a id='line_207'>    Make yourselves scabs?</a>
<a id='line_208'>  FIRST CITIZEN. We have ever your good word.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  MARCIUS. He that will give good words to thee will flatter</a>
<a id='line_210'>    Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</a>
<a id='line_211'>    That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,</a>
<a id='line_212'>    The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</a>
<a id='line_213'>    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</a>
<a id='line_214'>    Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,</a>
<a id='line_215'>    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice</a>
<a id='line_216'>    Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</a>
<a id='line_217'>    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,</a>
<a id='line_218'>    And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness</a>
<a id='line_219'>    Deserves your hate; and your affections are</a>
<a id='line_220'>    A sick man's appetite, who desires most that</a>
<a id='line_221'>    Which would increase his evil. He that depends</a>
<a id='line_222'>    Upon your favours swims with fins of lead,</a>
<a id='line_223'>    And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?</a>
<a id='line_224'>    With every minute you do change a mind</a>
<a id='line_225'>    And call him noble that was now your hate,</a>
<a id='line_226'>    Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter</a>
<a id='line_227'>    That in these several places of the city</a>
<a id='line_228'>    You cry against the noble Senate, who,</a>
<a id='line_229'>    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</a>
<a id='line_230'>    Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?</a>
<a id='line_231'>  MENENIUS. For corn at their own rates, whereof they say</a>
<a id='line_232'>    The city is well stor'd.</a>
<a id='line_233'>  MARCIUS. Hang 'em! They say!</a>
<a id='line_234'>    They'll sit by th' fire and presume to know</a>
<a id='line_235'>    What's done i' th' Capitol, who's like to rise,</a>
<a id='line_236'>    Who thrives and who declines; side factions, and give out</a>
<a id='line_237'>    Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,</a>
<a id='line_238'>    And feebling such as stand not in their liking</a>
<a id='line_239'>    Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!</a>
<a id='line_240'>    Would the nobility lay aside their ruth</a>
<a id='line_241'>    And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry</a>
<a id='line_242'>    With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high</a>
<a id='line_243'>    As I could pick my lance.</a>
<a id='line_244'>  MENENIUS. Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</a>
<a id='line_245'>    For though abundantly they lack discretion,</a>
<a id='line_246'>    Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,</a>
<a id='line_247'>    What says the other troop?</a>
<a id='line_248'>  MARCIUS. They are dissolv'd. Hang 'em!</a>
<a id='line_249'>    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs-</a>
<a id='line_250'>    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</a>
<a id='line_251'>    That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</a>
<a id='line_252'>    Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds</a>
<a id='line_253'>    They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,</a>
<a id='line_254'>    And a petition granted them- a strange one,</a>
<a id='line_255'>    To break the heart of generosity</a>
<a id='line_256'>    And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps</a>
<a id='line_257'>    As they would hang them on the horns o' th' moon,</a>
<a id='line_258'>    Shouting their emulation.</a>
<a id='line_259'>  MENENIUS. What is granted them?</a>
<a id='line_260'>  MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</a>
<a id='line_261'>    Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-</a>
<a id='line_262'>    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!</a>
<a id='line_263'>    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city</a>
<a id='line_264'>    Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time</a>
<a id='line_265'>    Win upon power and throw forth greater themes</a>
<a id='line_266'>    For insurrection's arguing.</a>
<a id='line_267'>  MENENIUS. This is strange.</a>
<a id='line_268'>  MARCIUS. Go get you home, you fragments.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>                     Enter a MESSENGER, hastily</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>  MESSENGER. Where's Caius Marcius?</a>
<a id='line_273'>  MARCIUS. Here. What's the matter?</a>
<a id='line_274'>  MESSENGER. The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.</a>
<a id='line_275'>  MARCIUS. I am glad on't; then we shall ha' means to vent</a>
<a id='line_276'>    Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>         Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, with other SENATORS;</a>
<a id='line_279'>                  JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>  FIRST SENATOR. Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us:</a>
<a id='line_282'>    The Volsces are in arms.</a>
<a id='line_283'>  MARCIUS. They have a leader,</a>
<a id='line_284'>    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.</a>
<a id='line_285'>    I sin in envying his nobility;</a>
<a id='line_286'>    And were I anything but what I am,</a>
<a id='line_287'>    I would wish me only he.</a>
<a id='line_288'>  COMINIUS. You have fought together?</a>
<a id='line_289'>  MARCIUS. Were half to half the world by th' ears, and he</a>
<a id='line_290'>    Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make</a>
<a id='line_291'>    Only my wars with him. He is a lion</a>
<a id='line_292'>    That I am proud to hunt.</a>
<a id='line_293'>  FIRST SENATOR. Then, worthy Marcius,</a>
<a id='line_294'>    Attend upon Cominius to these wars.</a>
<a id='line_295'>  COMINIUS. It is your former promise.</a>
<a id='line_296'>  MARCIUS. Sir, it is;</a>

<a id='line_467'>    hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run</a>
<a id='line_468'>    after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go</a>
<a id='line_469'>    again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up</a>
<a id='line_470'>    again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how</a>
<a id='line_471'>    'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he</a>
<a id='line_472'>    mammock'd it!</a>

<a id='line_487'>  VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?</a>

<a id='line_989'></a>
<a id='line_990'>  MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.</a>
<a id='line_991'>  BRUTUS. Good or bad?</a>
<a id='line_992'>  MENENIUS. Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love</a>

<a id='line_994'>  SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.</a>

<a id='line_997'>  MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the</a>
<a id='line_998'>    noble Marcius.</a>
<a id='line_999'>  BRUTUS. He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  MENENIUS. He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb. You two are</a>
<a id='line_1001'>    old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  MENENIUS. In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not</a>
<a id='line_1004'>    in abundance?</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  BRUTUS. He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.</a>
<a id='line_1006'>  SICINIUS. Especially in pride.</a>
<a id='line_1007'>  BRUTUS. And topping all others in boasting.</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  MENENIUS. This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured</a>

<a id='line_1010'>  BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censur'd?</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  MENENIUS. Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well.</a>
<a id='line_1013'>  MENENIUS. Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures- at the</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame</a>
<a id='line_1017'>    Marcius for being proud?</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  MENENIUS. I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of</a>
<a id='line_1022'>    pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your</a>
<a id='line_1023'>    necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    that you could!</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  MENENIUS. Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,</a>
<a id='line_1027'>    proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.</a>
<a id='line_1028'>  SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known well enough too.</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  MENENIUS. I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't; said to</a>
<a id='line_1031'>    be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more</a>
<a id='line_1033'>    with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the</a>
<a id='line_1034'>    morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.</a>
<a id='line_1035'>    Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I cannot call you</a>
<a id='line_1036'>    Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have</a>
<a id='line_1038'>    deliver'd the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with</a>
<a id='line_1039'>    the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to</a>
<a id='line_1040'>    bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie</a>
<a id='line_1041'>    deadly that tell you you have good faces. If you see this in the</a>
<a id='line_1042'>    map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too?</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    character, if I be known well enough too?</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  BRUTUS. Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  MENENIUS. You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are</a>
<a id='line_1047'>    ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good</a>
<a id='line_1048'>    wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence</a>
<a id='line_1050'>    to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All</a>
<a id='line_1055'>    the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  BRUTUS. Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    beards; and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud; who, in a</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion;</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    hangmen. God-den to your worships. More of your conversation</a>
<a id='line_1068'>    would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly</a>

<a id='line_1087'>  VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  MENENIUS. A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years'</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to</a>

<a id='line_1094'>  VOLUMNIA. O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.</a>

<a id='line_1099'>  MENENIUS. Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius</a>

<a id='line_1278'>SCENE II. Rome. The Capitol</a>
<a id='line_1279'></a>
<a id='line_1280'>Enter two OFFICERS, to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol</a>
<a id='line_1281'></a>
<a id='line_1282'>  FIRST OFFICER. Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for</a>
<a id='line_1283'>    consulships?</a>
<a id='line_1284'>  SECOND OFFICER. Three, they say; but 'tis thought of every one</a>
<a id='line_1285'>    Coriolanus will carry it.</a>
<a id='line_1286'>  FIRST OFFICER. That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and</a>
<a id='line_1287'>    loves not the common people.</a>
<a id='line_1288'>  SECOND OFFICER. Faith, there have been many great men that have</a>
<a id='line_1289'>    flatter'd the people, who ne'er loved them; and there be many</a>
<a id='line_1290'>    that they have loved, they know not wherefore; so that, if they</a>
<a id='line_1291'>    love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground.</a>
<a id='line_1292'>    Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or</a>
<a id='line_1293'>    hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their</a>
<a id='line_1294'>    disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly</a>
<a id='line_1295'>    see't.</a>
<a id='line_1296'>  FIRST OFFICER. If he did not care whether he had their love or no,</a>
<a id='line_1297'>    he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm;</a>
<a id='line_1298'>    but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can</a>
<a id='line_1299'>    render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover</a>
<a id='line_1300'>    him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and</a>
<a id='line_1301'>    displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to</a>
<a id='line_1302'>    flatter them for their love.</a>
<a id='line_1303'>  SECOND OFFICER. He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his</a>
<a id='line_1304'>    ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been</a>
<a id='line_1305'>    supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further</a>
<a id='line_1306'>    deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but</a>
<a id='line_1307'>    he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in</a>
<a id='line_1308'>    their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess</a>
<a id='line_1309'>    so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise</a>
<a id='line_1310'>    were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof</a>
<a id='line_1311'>    and rebuke from every car that heard it.</a>
<a id='line_1312'>  FIRST OFFICER. No more of him; he's a worthy man. Make way, they</a>

<a id='line_1376'>    That's thousand to one good one- when you now see</a>
<a id='line_1377'>    He had rather venture all his limbs for honour</a>
<a id='line_1378'>    Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</a>
<a id='line_1379'>  COMINIUS. I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus</a>
<a id='line_1380'>    Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held</a>
<a id='line_1381'>    That valour is the chiefest virtue and</a>
<a id='line_1382'>    Most dignifies the haver. If it be,</a>
<a id='line_1383'>    The man I speak of cannot in the world</a>
<a id='line_1384'>    Be singly counterpois'd. At sixteen years,</a>
<a id='line_1385'>    When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</a>
<a id='line_1386'>    Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator,</a>
<a id='line_1387'>    Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight</a>
<a id='line_1388'>    When with his Amazonian chin he drove</a>
<a id='line_1389'>    The bristled lips before him; he bestrid</a>
<a id='line_1390'>    An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view</a>
<a id='line_1391'>    Slew three opposers; Tarquin's self he met,</a>
<a id='line_1392'>    And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,</a>
<a id='line_1393'>    When he might act the woman in the scene,</a>
<a id='line_1394'>    He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed</a>
<a id='line_1395'>    Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</a>
<a id='line_1396'>    Man-ent'red thus, he waxed like a sea,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>    And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</a>
<a id='line_1398'>    He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>    Before and in Corioli, let me say</a>
<a id='line_1400'>    I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers,</a>
<a id='line_1401'>    And by his rare example made the coward</a>
<a id='line_1402'>    Turn terror into sport; as weeds before</a>
<a id='line_1403'>    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd</a>
<a id='line_1404'>    And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,</a>
<a id='line_1405'>    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</a>
<a id='line_1406'>    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</a>
<a id='line_1407'>    Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red</a>
<a id='line_1408'>    The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted</a>
<a id='line_1409'>    With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</a>
<a id='line_1410'>    And with a sudden re-enforcement struck</a>
<a id='line_1411'>    Corioli like a planet. Now all's his.</a>
<a id='line_1412'>    When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce</a>
<a id='line_1413'>    His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit</a>
<a id='line_1414'>    Re-quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate,</a>
<a id='line_1415'>    And to the battle came he; where he did</a>
<a id='line_1416'>    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if</a>
<a id='line_1417'>    'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd</a>

<a id='line_1424'>    And look'd upon things precious as they were</a>

<a id='line_1426'>    Than misery itself would give, rewards</a>
<a id='line_1427'>    His deeds with doing them, and is content</a>

<a id='line_1484'>  THIRD CITIZEN. We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a</a>

<a id='line_1907'>    Given Hydra here to choose an officer</a>
<a id='line_1908'>    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but</a>
<a id='line_1909'>    The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit</a>
<a id='line_1910'>    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>    And make your channel his? If he have power,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>    Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</a>
<a id='line_1913'>    Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,</a>
<a id='line_1914'>    Be not as common fools; if you are not,</a>
<a id='line_1915'>    Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,</a>

<a id='line_1917'>    When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste</a>
<a id='line_1918'>    Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate;</a>
<a id='line_1919'>    And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'</a>
<a id='line_1920'>    His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench</a>
<a id='line_1921'>    Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>    It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches</a>
<a id='line_1923'>    To know, when two authorities are up,</a>
<a id='line_1924'>    Neither supreme, how soon confusion</a>
<a id='line_1925'>    May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take</a>
<a id='line_1926'>    The one by th' other.</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-place.</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  CORIOLANUS. Whoever gave that counsel to give forth</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd</a>
<a id='line_1930'>    Sometime in Greece-</a>

<a id='line_1932'>  CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'r-</a>
<a id='line_1933'>    I say they nourish'd disobedience, fed</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    The ruin of the state.</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  BRUTUS. Why shall the people give</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    One that speaks thus their voice?</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  CORIOLANUS. I'll give my reasons,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    Was not our recompense, resting well assur'd</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</a>
<a id='line_1943'>    Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war,</a>
<a id='line_1944'>    Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    Which they have often made against the Senate,</a>
<a id='line_1947'>    All cause unborn, could never be the native</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    How shall this bosom multiplied digest</a>
<a id='line_1950'>    The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    We are the greater poll, and in true fear</a>
<a id='line_1953'>    They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    The nature of our seats, and make the rabble</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    Call our cares fears; which will in time</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    The crows to peck the eagles.</a>
<a id='line_1958'>  MENENIUS. Come, enough.</a>
<a id='line_1959'>  BRUTUS. Enough, with over measure.</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  CORIOLANUS. No, take more.</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    What may be sworn by, both divine and human,</a>
<a id='line_1962'>    Seal what I end withal! This double worship,</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,</a>
<a id='line_1965'>    Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</a>
<a id='line_1966'>    Of general ignorance- it must omit</a>
<a id='line_1967'>    Real necessities, and give way the while</a>
<a id='line_1968'>    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr'd, it follows</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you-</a>

<a id='line_1971'>    That love the fundamental part of state</a>
<a id='line_1972'>    More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer</a>

<a id='line_2756'>    well saved me a day's journey.</a>
<a id='line_2757'>  ROMAN. There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people</a>

<a id='line_2762'>  ROMAN. The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make</a>

<a id='line_2930'>    Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity</a>
<a id='line_2931'>    Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope,</a>

<a id='line_2939'>    Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight</a>
<a id='line_2940'>    And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it</a>
<a id='line_2941'>    That my revengeful services may prove</a>
<a id='line_2942'>    As benefits to thee; for I will fight</a>

<a id='line_2954'>  AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius!</a>
<a id='line_2955'>    Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart</a>

<a id='line_2958'>    And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more</a>

<a id='line_2964'>    As hotly and as nobly with thy love</a>
<a id='line_2965'>    As ever in ambitious strength I did</a>

<a id='line_2967'>    I lov'd the maid I married; never man</a>
<a id='line_2968'>    Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,</a>
<a id='line_2969'>    Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart</a>
<a id='line_2970'>    Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</a>

<a id='line_2973'>    Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,</a>
<a id='line_2974'>    Or lose mine arm for't. Thou hast beat me out</a>
<a id='line_2975'>    Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</a>
<a id='line_2976'>    Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me-</a>
<a id='line_2977'>    We have been down together in my sleep,</a>
<a id='line_2978'>    Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat-</a>

<a id='line_2980'>    Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that</a>
<a id='line_2981'>    Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all</a>

<a id='line_2983'>    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</a>
<a id='line_2984'>    Like a bold flood o'erbeat. O, come, go in,</a>

<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>                    The two SERVINGMEN come forward</a>
<a id='line_3005'></a>
<a id='line_3006'>  FIRST SERVANT. Here's a strange alteration!</a>
<a id='line_3007'>  SECOND SERVANT. By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with</a>
<a id='line_3008'>    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report</a>
<a id='line_3009'>    of him.</a>
<a id='line_3010'>  FIRST SERVANT. What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his</a>
<a id='line_3011'>    finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.</a>
<a id='line_3012'>  SECOND SERVANT. Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in</a>
<a id='line_3013'>    him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to</a>
<a id='line_3014'>    term it.</a>
<a id='line_3015'>  FIRST SERVANT. He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd,</a>
<a id='line_3016'>    but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</a>
<a id='line_3017'>  SECOND SERVANT. So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest</a>
<a id='line_3018'>    man i' th' world.</a>
<a id='line_3019'>  FIRST SERVANT. I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot</a>
<a id='line_3020'>    on.</a>
<a id='line_3021'>  SECOND SERVANT. Who, my master?</a>
<a id='line_3022'>  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, it's no matter for that.</a>
<a id='line_3023'>  SECOND SERVANT. Worth six on him.</a>
<a id='line_3024'>  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the</a>
<a id='line_3025'>    greater soldier.</a>
<a id='line_3026'>  SECOND SERVANT. Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that;</a>
<a id='line_3027'>    for the defence of a town our general is excellent.</a>
<a id='line_3028'>  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and for an assault too.</a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>                       Re-enter the third SERVINGMAN</a>
<a id='line_3031'></a>
<a id='line_3032'>  THIRD SERVANT. O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals!</a>
<a id='line_3033'>  BOTH. What, what, what? Let's partake.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>  THIRD SERVANT. I would not be a Roman, of all nations;</a>
<a id='line_3035'>    I had as lief be a condemn'd man.</a>
<a id='line_3036'>  BOTH. Wherefore? wherefore?</a>
<a id='line_3037'>  THIRD SERVANT. Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general-</a>
<a id='line_3038'>    Caius Marcius.</a>
<a id='line_3039'>  FIRST SERVANT. Why do you say 'thwack our general'?</a>
<a id='line_3040'>  THIRD SERVANT. I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always</a>
<a id='line_3041'>    good enough for him.</a>
<a id='line_3042'>  SECOND SERVANT. Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too</a>
<a id='line_3043'>    hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.</a>
<a id='line_3044'>  FIRST SERVANT. He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth</a>
<a id='line_3045'>    on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a</a>
<a id='line_3046'>    carbonado.</a>
<a id='line_3047'>  SECOND SERVANT. An he had been cannibally given, he might have</a>
<a id='line_3048'>    broil'd and eaten him too.</a>
<a id='line_3049'>  FIRST SERVANT. But more of thy news!</a>
<a id='line_3050'>  THIRD SERVANT. Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son</a>
<a id='line_3051'>    and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' th' table; no question</a>
<a id='line_3052'>    asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him.</a>
<a id='line_3053'>    Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself</a>
<a id='line_3054'>    with's hand, and turns up the white o' th' eye to his discourse.</a>
<a id='line_3055'>    But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i' th' middle</a>
<a id='line_3056'>    and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the other has half</a>
<a id='line_3057'>    by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,</a>
<a id='line_3058'>    and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th' ears; he will mow all</a>
<a id='line_3059'>    down before him, and leave his passage poll'd.</a>
<a id='line_3060'>  SECOND SERVANT. And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.</a>
<a id='line_3061'>  THIRD SERVANT. Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as</a>
<a id='line_3062'>    many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst</a>
<a id='line_3063'>    not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends,</a>
<a id='line_3064'>    whilst he's in directitude.</a>
<a id='line_3065'>  FIRST SERVANT. Directitude? What's that?</a>
<a id='line_3066'>  THIRD SERVANT. But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and</a>
<a id='line_3067'>    the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies</a>
<a id='line_3068'>    after rain, and revel an with him.</a>
<a id='line_3069'>  FIRST SERVANT. But when goes this forward?</a>
<a id='line_3070'>  THIRD SERVANT. To-morrow, to-day, presently. You shall have the</a>
<a id='line_3071'>    drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their</a>
<a id='line_3072'>    feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.</a>
<a id='line_3073'>  SECOND SERVANT. Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.</a>
<a id='line_3074'>    This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and</a>
<a id='line_3075'>    breed ballad-makers.</a>
<a id='line_3076'>  FIRST SERVANT. Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as</a>
<a id='line_3077'>    day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and full of vent.</a>
<a id='line_3078'>    Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; mull'd, deaf, sleepy,</a>
<a id='line_3079'>    insensible; a getter of more bastard children than war's a</a>
<a id='line_3080'>    destroyer of men.</a>
<a id='line_3081'>  SECOND SERVANT. 'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be</a>
<a id='line_3082'>    a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of</a>
<a id='line_3083'>    cuckolds.</a>
<a id='line_3084'>  FIRST SERVANT. Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</a>
<a id='line_3085'>  THIRD SERVANT. Reason: because they then less need one another. The</a>
<a id='line_3086'>    wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.</a>
<a id='line_3087'>    They are rising, they are rising.</a>
<a id='line_3088'>  BOTH. In, in, in, in!                                   Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_3176'>  MESSENGER. The nobles in great earnestness are going</a>

<a id='line_3186'>  MESSENGER. It is spoke freely out of many mouths-</a>

<a id='line_3238'>  COMINIUS. Ay; and you'll look pale</a>
<a id='line_3239'>    Before you find it other. All the regions</a>

<a id='line_3242'>    And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?</a>
<a id='line_3243'>    Your enemies and his find something in him.</a>
<a id='line_3244'>  MENENIUS. We are all undone unless</a>
<a id='line_3245'>    The noble man have mercy.</a>
<a id='line_3246'>  COMINIUS. Who shall ask it?</a>
<a id='line_3247'>    The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people</a>
<a id='line_3248'>    Deserve such pity of him as the wolf</a>

<a id='line_3261'>  BOTH TRIBUNES. Say not we brought it.</a>
<a id='line_3262'>  MENENIUS. How! Was't we? We lov'd him, but, like beasts</a>

<a id='line_3289'>  THIRD CITIZEN. And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very</a>

<a id='line_3318'>    Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat,</a>
<a id='line_3319'>    Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;</a>

<a id='line_3323'>    Unless by using means I lame the foot</a>
<a id='line_3324'>    Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,</a>
<a id='line_3325'>    Even to my person, than I thought he would</a>
<a id='line_3326'>    When first I did embrace him; yet his nature</a>

<a id='line_3333'>    To him had left it solely.</a>
<a id='line_3334'>  AUFIDIUS. I understand thee well; and be thou sure,</a>
<a id='line_3335'>    When he shall come to his account, he knows not</a>
<a id='line_3336'>    What I can urge against him. Although it seems,</a>
<a id='line_3337'>    And so he thinks, and is no less apparent</a>
<a id='line_3338'>    To th' vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly</a>
<a id='line_3339'>    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon</a>

<a id='line_3343'>    Whene'er we come to our account.</a>
<a id='line_3344'>  LIEUTENANT. Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?</a>

<a id='line_3346'>    And the nobility of Rome are his;</a>
<a id='line_3347'>    The senators and patricians love him too.</a>
<a id='line_3348'>    The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people</a>
<a id='line_3349'>    Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty</a>
<a id='line_3350'>    To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome</a>
<a id='line_3351'>    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</a>
<a id='line_3352'>    By sovereignty of nature. First he was</a>
<a id='line_3353'>    A noble servant to them, but he could not</a>
<a id='line_3354'>    Carry his honours even. Whether 'twas pride,</a>
<a id='line_3355'>    Which out of daily fortune ever taints</a>
<a id='line_3356'>    The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>    To fail in the disposing of those chances</a>
<a id='line_3358'>    Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</a>
<a id='line_3359'>    Not to be other than one thing, not moving</a>
<a id='line_3360'>    From th' casque to th' cushion, but commanding peace</a>
<a id='line_3361'>    Even with the same austerity and garb</a>
<a id='line_3362'>    As he controll'd the war; but one of these-</a>
<a id='line_3363'>    As he hath spices of them all- not all,</a>
<a id='line_3364'>    For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd,</a>
<a id='line_3365'>    So hated, and so banish'd. But he has a merit</a>

<a id='line_3368'>    And power, unto itself most commendable,</a>

<a id='line_3424'>  MENENIUS. No; I'll not meddle.</a>
<a id='line_3425'>  SICINIUS. Pray you go to him.</a>
<a id='line_3426'>  MENENIUS. What should I do?</a>
<a id='line_3427'>  BRUTUS. Only make trial what your love can do</a>
<a id='line_3428'>    For Rome, towards Marcius.</a>
<a id='line_3429'>  MENENIUS. Well, and say that Marcius</a>
<a id='line_3430'>    Return me, as Cominius is return'd,</a>
<a id='line_3431'>    Unheard- what then?</a>
<a id='line_3432'>    But as a discontented friend, grief-shot</a>
<a id='line_3433'>    With his unkindness? Say't be so?</a>
<a id='line_3434'>  SICINIUS. Yet your good will</a>
<a id='line_3435'>    Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure</a>
<a id='line_3436'>    As you intended well.</a>
<a id='line_3437'>  MENENIUS. I'll undertake't;</a>
<a id='line_3438'>    I think he'll hear me. Yet to bite his lip</a>
<a id='line_3439'>    And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.</a>
<a id='line_3440'>    He was not taken well: he had not din'd;</a>
<a id='line_3441'>    The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then</a>
<a id='line_3442'>    We pout upon the morning, are unapt</a>
<a id='line_3443'>    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd</a>
<a id='line_3444'>    These pipes and these conveyances of our blood</a>
<a id='line_3445'>    With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls</a>

<a id='line_3447'>    Till he be dieted to my request,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>    And then I'll set upon him.</a>
<a id='line_3449'>  BRUTUS. You know the very road into his kindness</a>
<a id='line_3450'>    And cannot lose your way.</a>
<a id='line_3451'>  MENENIUS. Good faith, I'll prove him,</a>
<a id='line_3452'>    Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge</a>
<a id='line_3453'>    Of my success.                                          Exit</a>
<a id='line_3454'>  COMINIUS. He'll never hear him.</a>
<a id='line_3455'>  SICINIUS. Not?</a>
<a id='line_3456'>  COMINIUS. I tell you he does sit in gold, his eye</a>
<a id='line_3457'>    Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury</a>
<a id='line_3458'>    The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;</a>
<a id='line_3459'>    'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me</a>
<a id='line_3460'>    Thus with his speechless hand. What he would do,</a>

<a id='line_3467'>    And with our fair entreaties haste them on.           Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_3481'>    Will no more hear from thence.</a>
<a id='line_3482'>  SECOND WATCH. You'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before</a>
<a id='line_3483'>    You'll speak with Coriolanus.</a>
<a id='line_3484'>  MENENIUS. Good my friends,</a>
<a id='line_3485'>    If you have heard your general talk of Rome</a>

<a id='line_3487'>    My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.</a>

<a id='line_3490'>  MENENIUS. I tell thee, fellow,</a>
<a id='line_3491'>    Thy general is my lover. I have been</a>

<a id='line_3493'>    His fame unparallel'd haply amplified;</a>
<a id='line_3494'>    For I have ever verified my friends-</a>
<a id='line_3495'>    Of whom he's chief- with all the size that verity</a>
<a id='line_3496'>    Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes,</a>
<a id='line_3497'>    Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</a>
<a id='line_3498'>    I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise</a>
<a id='line_3499'>    Have almost stamp'd the leasing; therefore, fellow,</a>
<a id='line_3500'>    I must have leave to pass.</a>
<a id='line_3501'>  FIRST WATCH. Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf</a>

<a id='line_3507'>  SECOND WATCH. Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you</a>
<a id='line_3508'>    have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot</a>
<a id='line_3509'>    pass. Therefore go back.</a>
<a id='line_3510'>  MENENIUS. Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with</a>
<a id='line_3511'>    him till after dinner.</a>
<a id='line_3512'>  FIRST WATCH. You are a Roman, are you?</a>
<a id='line_3513'>  MENENIUS. I am as thy general is.</a>
<a id='line_3514'>  FIRST WATCH. Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when</a>
<a id='line_3515'>    you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in</a>
<a id='line_3516'>    a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think</a>
<a id='line_3517'>    to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the</a>
<a id='line_3518'>    virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied</a>
<a id='line_3519'>    intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you</a>
<a id='line_3520'>    think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame</a>
<a id='line_3521'>    in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore</a>
<a id='line_3522'>    back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd;</a>
<a id='line_3523'>    our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.</a>
<a id='line_3524'>  MENENIUS. Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me</a>

<a id='line_3526'>  FIRST WATCH. Come, my captain knows you not.</a>
<a id='line_3527'>  MENENIUS. I mean thy general.</a>
<a id='line_3528'>  FIRST WATCH. My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I</a>
<a id='line_3529'>    let forth your half pint of blood. Back- that's the utmost of</a>

<a id='line_3531'>  MENENIUS. Nay, but fellow, fellow-</a>
<a id='line_3532'></a>
<a id='line_3533'>                      Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS</a>
<a id='line_3534'></a>
<a id='line_3535'>  CORIOLANUS. What's the matter?</a>
<a id='line_3536'>  MENENIUS. Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you; you shall</a>
<a id='line_3537'>    know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack</a>
<a id='line_3538'>    guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my</a>

<a id='line_3540'>    hanging, or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller</a>
<a id='line_3541'>    in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what's to come</a>
<a id='line_3542'>    upon thee. The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy</a>
<a id='line_3543'>    particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father</a>
<a id='line_3544'>    Menenius does! O my son! my son! thou art preparing fire for us;</a>
<a id='line_3545'>    look thee, here's water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come</a>
<a id='line_3546'>    to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I</a>
<a id='line_3547'>    have been blown out of your gates with sighs, and conjure thee to</a>
<a id='line_3548'>    pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage</a>
<a id='line_3549'>    thy wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here; this,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>    who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee.</a>
<a id='line_3551'>  CORIOLANUS. Away!</a>
<a id='line_3552'>  MENENIUS. How! away!</a>
<a id='line_3553'>  CORIOLANUS. Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs</a>

<a id='line_3557'>    Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather</a>
<a id='line_3558'>    Than pity note how much. Therefore be gone.</a>
<a id='line_3559'>    Mine ears against your suits are stronger than</a>
<a id='line_3560'>    Your gates against my force. Yet, for I lov'd thee,</a>
<a id='line_3561'>    Take this along; I writ it for thy sake     [Gives a letter]</a>

<a id='line_3568'>  SECOND WATCH. 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the</a>

<a id='line_3570'>  FIRST WATCH. Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your</a>
<a id='line_3571'>    greatness back?</a>
<a id='line_3572'>  SECOND WATCH. What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?</a>
<a id='line_3573'>  MENENIUS. I neither care for th' world nor your general; for such</a>
<a id='line_3574'>    things as you, I can scarce think there's any, y'are so slight.</a>
<a id='line_3575'>    He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another.</a>
<a id='line_3576'>    Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long;</a>

<a id='line_3578'>    said to: Away!                                          Exit</a>
<a id='line_3579'>  FIRST WATCH. A noble fellow, I warrant him.</a>
<a id='line_3580'>  SECOND WATCH. The worthy fellow is our general; he's the rock, the</a>
