<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      After the fall of the Roman empire in the West, an interval of</a>
<a id='line_9'>      fifty years, till the memorable reign of Justinian, is faintly</a>
<a id='line_10'>      marked by the obscure names and imperfect annals of Zeno,</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Anastasius, and Justin, who successively ascended to the throne</a>
<a id='line_12'>      of Constantinople. During the same period, Italy revived and</a>
<a id='line_13'>      flourished under the government of a Gothic king, who might have</a>
<a id='line_14'>      deserved a statue among the best and bravest of the ancient</a>
<a id='line_15'>      Romans.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>      Theodoric the Ostrogoth, the fourteenth in lineal descent of the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      royal line of the Amali, 1 was born in the neighborhood of Vienna</a>
<a id='line_19'>      2 two years after the death of Attila. 2111 A recent victory had</a>
<a id='line_20'>      restored the independence of the Ostrogoths; and the three</a>
<a id='line_21'>      brothers, Walamir, Theodemir, and Widimir, who ruled that warlike</a>
<a id='line_22'>      nation with united counsels, had separately pitched their</a>
<a id='line_23'>      habitations in the fertile though desolate province of Pannonia.</a>
<a id='line_24'>      The Huns still threatened their revolted subjects, but their</a>
<a id='line_25'>      hasty attack was repelled by the single forces of Walamir, and</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the news of his victory reached the distant camp of his brother</a>
<a id='line_27'>      in the same auspicious moment that the favorite concubine of</a>
<a id='line_28'>      Theodemir was delivered of a son and heir. In the eighth year of</a>
<a id='line_29'>      his age, Theodoric was reluctantly yielded by his father to the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      public interest, as the pledge of an alliance which Leo, emperor</a>
<a id='line_31'>      of the East, had consented to purchase by an annual subsidy of</a>
<a id='line_32'>      three hundred pounds of gold. The royal hostage was educated at</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Constantinople with care and tenderness. His body was formed to</a>
<a id='line_34'>      all the exercises of war, his mind was expanded by the habits of</a>
<a id='line_35'>      liberal conversation; he frequented the schools of the most</a>
<a id='line_36'>      skilful masters; but he disdained or neglected the arts of</a>
<a id='line_37'>      Greece, and so ignorant did he always remain of the first</a>
<a id='line_38'>      elements of science, that a rude mark was contrived to represent</a>
<a id='line_39'>      the signature of the illiterate king of Italy. 3 As soon as he</a>
<a id='line_40'>      had attained the age of eighteen, he was restored to the wishes</a>
<a id='line_41'>      of the Ostrogoths, whom the emperor aspired to gain by liberality</a>
<a id='line_42'>      and confidence. Walamir had fallen in battle; the youngest of the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      brothers, Widimir, had led away into Italy and Gaul an army of</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Barbarians, and the whole nation acknowledged for their king the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      father of Theodoric. His ferocious subjects admired the strength</a>
<a id='line_46'>      and stature of their young prince; 4 and he soon convinced them</a>
<a id='line_47'>      that he had not degenerated from the valor of his ancestors. At</a>
<a id='line_48'>      the head of six thousand volunteers, he secretly left the camp in</a>
<a id='line_49'>      quest of adventures, descended the Danube as far as Singidunum,</a>
<a id='line_50'>      or Belgrade, and soon returned to his father with the spoils of a</a>
<a id='line_51'>      Sarmatian king whom he had vanquished and slain. Such triumphs,</a>
<a id='line_52'>      however, were productive only of fame, and the invincible</a>
<a id='line_53'>      Ostrogoths were reduced to extreme distress by the want of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      clothing and food. They unanimously resolved to desert their</a>
<a id='line_55'>      Pannonian encampments, and boldly to advance into the warm and</a>
<a id='line_56'>      wealthy neighborhood of the Byzantine court, which already</a>
<a id='line_57'>      maintained in pride and luxury so many bands of confederate</a>
<a id='line_58'>      Goths. After proving, by some acts of hostility, that they could</a>
<a id='line_59'>      be dangerous, or at least troublesome, enemies, the Ostrogoths</a>
<a id='line_60'>      sold at a high price their reconciliation and fidelity, accepted</a>
<a id='line_61'>      a donative of lands and money, and were intrusted with the</a>
<a id='line_62'>      defence of the Lower Danube, under the command of Theodoric, who</a>
<a id='line_63'>      succeeded after his father’s death to the hereditary throne of</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the Amali. 5</a>

<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>      A hero, descended from a race of kings, must have despised the</a>
<a id='line_117'>      base Isaurian who was invested with the Roman purple, without any</a>
<a id='line_118'>      endowment of mind or body, without any advantages of royal birth,</a>
<a id='line_119'>      or superior qualifications. After the failure of the Theodosian</a>
<a id='line_120'>      line, the choice of Pulcheria and of the senate might be</a>
<a id='line_121'>      justified in some measure by the characters of Martin and Leo,</a>
<a id='line_122'>      but the latter of these princes confirmed and dishonored his</a>
<a id='line_123'>      reign by the perfidious murder of Aspar and his sons, who too</a>
<a id='line_124'>      rigorously exacted the debt of gratitude and obedience. The</a>
<a id='line_125'>      inheritance of Leo and of the East was peaceably devolved on his</a>
<a id='line_126'>      infant grandson, the son of his daughter Ariadne; and her</a>
<a id='line_127'>      Isaurian husband, the fortunate Trascalisseus, exchanged that</a>
<a id='line_128'>      barbarous sound for the Grecian appellation of Zeno. After the</a>
<a id='line_129'>      decease of the elder Leo, he approached with unnatural respect</a>
<a id='line_130'>      the throne of his son, humbly received, as a gift, the second</a>
<a id='line_131'>      rank in the empire, and soon excited the public suspicion on the</a>
<a id='line_132'>      sudden and premature death of his young colleague, whose life</a>
<a id='line_133'>      could no longer promote the success of his ambition. But the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      palace of Constantinople was ruled by female influence, and</a>
<a id='line_135'>      agitated by female passions: and Verina, the widow of Leo,</a>
<a id='line_136'>      claiming his empire as her own, pronounced a sentence of</a>
<a id='line_137'>      deposition against the worthless and ungrateful servant on whom</a>
<a id='line_138'>      she alone had bestowed the sceptre of the East. 6 As soon as she</a>
<a id='line_139'>      sounded a revolt in the ears of Zeno, he fled with precipitation</a>
<a id='line_140'>      into the mountains of Isauria, and her brother Basiliscus,</a>
<a id='line_141'>      already infamous by his African expedition, 7 was unanimously</a>
<a id='line_142'>      proclaimed by the servile senate. But the reign of the usurper</a>
<a id='line_143'>      was short and turbulent. Basiliscus presumed to assassinate the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      lover of his sister; he dared to offend the lover of his wife,</a>
<a id='line_145'>      the vain and insolent Harmatius, who, in the midst of Asiatic</a>
<a id='line_146'>      luxury, affected the dress, the demeanor, and the surname of</a>
<a id='line_147'>      Achilles. 8 By the conspiracy of the malcontent s, Zeno was</a>
<a id='line_148'>      recalled from exile; the armies, the capital, the person, of</a>
<a id='line_149'>      Basiliscus, were betrayed; and his whole family was condemned to</a>
<a id='line_150'>      the long agony of cold and hunger by the inhuman conqueror, who</a>
<a id='line_151'>      wanted courage to encounter or to forgive his enemies. 811 The</a>
<a id='line_152'>      haughty spirit of Verina was still incapable of submission or</a>
<a id='line_153'>      repose. She provoked the enmity of a favorite general, embraced</a>
<a id='line_154'>      his cause as soon as he was disgraced, created a new emperor in</a>
<a id='line_155'>      Syria and Egypt, 812 raised an army of seventy thousand men, and</a>
<a id='line_156'>      persisted to the last moment of her life in a fruitless</a>
<a id='line_157'>      rebellion, which, according to the fashion of the age, had been</a>
<a id='line_158'>      predicted by Christian hermits and Pagan magicians. While the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      East was afflicted by the passions of Verina, her daughter</a>
<a id='line_160'>      Ariadne was distinguished by the female virtues of mildness and</a>
<a id='line_161'>      fidelity; she followed her husband in his exile, and after his</a>
<a id='line_162'>      restoration, she implored his clemency in favor of her mother. On</a>
<a id='line_163'>      the decease of Zeno, Ariadne, the daughter, the mother, and the</a>
<a id='line_164'>      widow of an emperor, gave her hand and the Imperial title to</a>
<a id='line_165'>      Anastasius, an aged domestic of the palace, who survived his</a>
<a id='line_166'>      elevation above twenty-seven years, and whose character is</a>

<a id='line_214'>      Walamirs, as they were called, pursued and pressed the Asiatic</a>

<a id='line_216'>      But the faithful servant was suddenly converted into a formidable</a>
<a id='line_217'>      enemy, who spread the flames of war from Constantinople to the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      Adriatic; many flourishing cities were reduced to ashes, and the</a>
<a id='line_219'>      agriculture of Thrace was almost extirpated by the wanton cruelty</a>
<a id='line_220'>      of the Goths, who deprived their captive peasants of the right</a>
<a id='line_221'>      hand that guided the plough. 11 On such occasions, Theodoric</a>
<a id='line_222'>      sustained the loud and specious reproach of disloyalty, of</a>
<a id='line_223'>      ingratitude, and of insatiate avarice, which could be only</a>
<a id='line_224'>      excused by the hard necessity of his situation. He reigned, not</a>
<a id='line_225'>      as the monarch, but as the minister of a ferocious people, whose</a>
<a id='line_226'>      spirit was unbroken by slavery, and impatient of real or</a>
<a id='line_227'>      imaginary insults. Their poverty was incurable; since the most</a>
<a id='line_228'>      liberal donatives were soon dissipated in wasteful luxury, and</a>
<a id='line_229'>      the most fertile estates became barren in their hands; they</a>
<a id='line_230'>      despised, but they envied, the laborious provincials; and when</a>
<a id='line_231'>      their subsistence had failed, the Ostrogoths embraced the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      familiar resources of war and rapine. It had been the wish of</a>
<a id='line_233'>      Theodoric (such at least was his declaration) to lead a peaceful,</a>
<a id='line_234'>      obscure, obedient life on the confines of Scythia, till the</a>
<a id='line_235'>      Byzantine court, by splendid and fallacious promises, seduced him</a>
<a id='line_236'>      to attack a confederate tribe of Goths, who had been engaged in</a>
<a id='line_237'>      the party of Basiliscus. He marched from his station in Maesia,</a>
<a id='line_238'>      on the solemn assurance that before he reached Adrianople, he</a>
<a id='line_239'>      should meet a plentiful convoy of provisions, and a reenforcement</a>
<a id='line_240'>      of eight thousand horse and thirty thousand foot, while the</a>
<a id='line_241'>      legions of Asia were encamped at Heraclea to second his</a>
<a id='line_242'>      operations. These measures were disappointed by mutual jealousy.</a>
<a id='line_243'>      As he advanced into Thrace, the son of Theodemir found an</a>

<a id='line_247'>      was assaulted by the arms and invectives of Theodoric the son of</a>

<a id='line_321'>      Zeno. Embracing an enterprise worthy of his courage and ambition,</a>
<a id='line_322'>      Theodoric addressed the emperor in the following words: “Although</a>

<a id='line_324'>      graciously listen to the wishes of my heart! Italy, the</a>

<a id='line_363'>      Goths, their aged parents, and most precious effects, were</a>

<a id='line_371'>      which they might impose on all who should presume to dispute the</a>

<a id='line_375'>      had been undertaken in the depth of a rigorous winter. Since the</a>

<a id='line_397'>      gained a short repose and refreshment to his wearied cavalry,</a>
<a id='line_398'>      than he boldly attacked the fortifications of the enemy; the</a>

<a id='line_401'>      was the possession of the Venetian province as far as the walls</a>

<a id='line_403'>      of the rapid Adige, he was opposed by a new army, reenforced in</a>
<a id='line_404'>      its numbers, and not impaired in its courage: the contest was</a>
<a id='line_405'>      more obstinate, but the event was still more decisive; Odoacer</a>
<a id='line_406'>      fled to Ravenna, Theodoric advanced to Milan, and the vanquished</a>
<a id='line_407'>      troops saluted their conqueror with loud acclamations of respect</a>

<a id='line_410'>      several Gothic counts, which had been rashly intrusted to a</a>
<a id='line_411'>      deserter, was betrayed and destroyed near Faenza by his double</a>
<a id='line_412'>      treachery; Odoacer again appeared master of the field, and the</a>
<a id='line_413'>      invader, strongly intrenched in his camp of Pavia, was reduced to</a>

<a id='line_420'>      Gothic king. Immediately before the battle of Verona, he visited</a>
<a id='line_421'>      the tent of his mother 19 and sister, and requested, that on a</a>
<a id='line_422'>      day, the most illustrious festival of his life, they would adorn</a>

<a id='line_464'>      unfortunate monarch yielded to the groans of his subjects and the</a>

<a id='line_569'>      by the rich and luxurious Barbarian; 31 but these mutual</a>

<a id='line_572'>      the former for the arts of peace, and the latter for the service</a>

<a id='line_820'>      a long train of wagons, were distributed to the fiercest of the</a>
<a id='line_821'>      Bulgarian tribes. But in the fields of Margus, the eastern powers</a>

<a id='line_823'>      flower and even the hope of the Roman armies was irretrievably</a>
<a id='line_824'>      destroyed; and such was the temperance with which Theodoric had</a>

<a id='line_826'>      given the signal of pillage, the rich spoils of the enemy lay</a>
<a id='line_827'>      untouched at their feet. 45 Exasperated by this disgrace, the</a>
<a id='line_828'>      Byzantine court despatched two hundred ships and eight thousand</a>

<a id='line_832'>      Hellespont, proud of their piratical victory over a people whom</a>
<a id='line_833'>      they still presumed to consider as their Roman brethren. 46 Their</a>
<a id='line_834'>      retreat was possibly hastened by the activity of Theodoric; Italy</a>
<a id='line_835'>      was covered by a fleet of a thousand light vessels, 47 which he</a>
<a id='line_836'>      constructed with incredible despatch; and his firm moderation was</a>
<a id='line_837'>      soon rewarded by a solid and honorable peace. He maintained, with</a>
<a id='line_838'>      a powerful hand, the balance of the West, till it was at length</a>

<a id='line_915'>      title of king, the whole substance and plenitude of Imperial</a>

<a id='line_932'>      the revenue was delegated to seven consulars, three correctors,</a>

<a id='line_934'>      according to the principles, and even the forms, of Roman</a>
<a id='line_935'>      jurisprudence. 55 The violence of the conquerors was abated or</a>
<a id='line_936'>      eluded by the slow artifice of judicial proceedings; the civil</a>
<a id='line_937'>      administration, with its honors and emoluments, was confined to</a>
<a id='line_938'>      the Italians; and the people still preserved their dress and</a>

<a id='line_940'>      thirds of their landed property. 5511 It had been the object of</a>
<a id='line_941'>      Augustus to conceal the introduction of monarchy; it was the</a>
<a id='line_942'>      policy of Theodoric to disguise the reign of a Barbarian. 56 If</a>
<a id='line_943'>      his subjects were sometimes awakened from this pleasing vision of</a>
<a id='line_944'>      a Roman government, they derived more substantial comfort from</a>

<a id='line_1083'>      viewed with fresh wonder the forum of Trajan and his lofty</a>

<a id='line_1458'>      happiness he had so assiduously labored to promote; and his mind</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      was soured by indignation, jealousy, and the bitterness of</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      unrequited love. The Gothic conqueror condescended to disarm the</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      unwarlike natives of Italy, interdicting all weapons of offence,</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      and excepting only a small knife for domestic use. The deliverer</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      of Rome was accused of conspiring with the vilest informers</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      against the lives of senators whom he suspected of a secret and</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      treasonable correspondence with the Byzantine court. 87 After the</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      death of Anastasius, the diadem had been placed on the head of a</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      feeble old man; but the powers of government were assumed by his</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      nephew Justinian, who already meditated the extirpation of</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      heresy, and the conquest of Italy and Africa. A rigorous law,</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      which was published at Constantinople, to reduce the Arians by</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      the dread of punishment within the pale of the church, awakened</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      the just resentment of Theodoric, who claimed for his distressed</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      brethren of the East the same indulgence which he had so long</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      granted to the Catholics of his dominions. 8711 At his stern</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      command, the Roman pontiff, with four illustrious senators,</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      embarked on an embassy, of which he must have alike dreaded the</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      failure or the success. The singular veneration shown to the</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      first pope who had visited Constantinople was punished as a crime</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      by his jealous monarch; the artful or peremptory refusal of the</a>

<a id='line_1481'>      larger, measure of retaliation; and a mandate was prepared in</a>

<a id='line_1527'>      the discipline of the republic. In the youth of Boethius the</a>

<a id='line_1532'>      erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      ardent curiosity: and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      laborious years in the schools of Athens, 91 which were supported</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      by the zeal, the learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his</a>

<a id='line_1538'>      polluted the groves of the academy; but he imbibed the spirit,</a>

<a id='line_1540'>      attempted to reconcile the strong and subtile sense of Aristotle</a>

<a id='line_1543'>      friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      palace of ivory and marble, to prosecute the same studies. 92 The</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      church was edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      against the Arian, the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      the Catholic unity was explained or exposed in a formal treatise</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      by the indifference of three distinct though consubstantial</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      persons. For the benefit of his Latin readers, his genius</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      submitted to teach the first elements of the arts and sciences of</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras, the</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      astronomy of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      Aristotle, with the commentary of Porphyry, were translated and</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      illustrated by the indefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      alone was esteemed capable of describing the wonders of art, a</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      sun-dial, a water-clock, or a sphere which represented the</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      motions of the planets. From these abstruse speculations,</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he rose to the social</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      duties of public and private life: the indigent were relieved by</a>

<a id='line_1563'>      the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      felt and rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius</a>

<a id='line_1624'>      country. His authority had restrained the pride and oppression of</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered Paulianus</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often</a>

<a id='line_1630'>      conquest, excited by avarice, and, as he complains, encouraged by</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      impunity. In these honorable contests his spirit soared above the</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      consideration of danger, and perhaps of prudence; and we may</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      learn from the example of Cato, that a character of pure and</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by prejudice, to</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities with</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the</a>

<a id='line_1639'>      and gratitude, must be insupportable to the free spirit of a</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      Roman patriot. But the favor and fidelity of Boethius declined in</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      just proportion with the public happiness; and an unworthy</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      colleague was imposed to divide and control the power of the</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      master of the offices. In the last gloomy season of Theodoric, he</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his master had only</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      power over his life, he stood without arms and without fear</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      own. The senator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      presumption of hoping, as it was said, the liberty of Rome. “If</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      Albinus be criminal,” exclaimed the orator, “the senate and</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      myself are all guilty of the same crime. If we are innocent,</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      Albinus is equally entitled to the protection of the laws.” These</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      laws might not have punished the simple and barren wish of an</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      unattainable blessing; but they would have shown less indulgence</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      to the rash confession of Boethius, that, had he known of a</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      conspiracy, the tyrant never should. 94 The advocate of Albinus</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the guilt of his</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery) was</a>

<a id='line_1661'>      perhaps of infamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs</a>

<a id='line_1697'></a>
<a id='line_1698'>      While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      sentence or the stroke of death, he composed, in the tower of</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      Pavia, the Consolation of Philosophy; a golden volume not</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      unworthy of the leisure of Plato or Tully, but which claims</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times and the</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      situation of the author. The celestial guide, whom he had so long</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended to illumine his</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity and</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      inconstancy of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      condition of her gifts; experience had satisfied him of their</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      real value; he had enjoyed them without guilt; he might resign</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the impotent malice of</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had left him</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended to heaven in search of</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      the Supreme Good; explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      and destiny, of prescience and free will, of time and eternity;</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and physical</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      government. Such topics of consolation so obvious, so vague, or</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      nature. Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labor</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine in the same</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      work the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence,</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      must already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of evils, was at length</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      determined by the ministers of death, who executed, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord was</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened, till</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      his eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      discovered in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      he expired. 98 But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      knowledge over the darkest ages of the Latin world; the writings</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      of the philosopher were translated by the most glorious of the</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      English kings, 99 and the third emperor of the name of Otho</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      removed to a more honorable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honors of</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      martyrdom, and the fame of miracles. 100 In the last hours of</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      Boethius, he derived some comfort from the safety of his two</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      sons, of his wife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      Symmachus. But the grief of Symmachus was indiscreet, and perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      disrespectful: he had presumed to lament, he might dare to</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was dragged in chains</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and</a>

<a id='line_1784'>      Theodoric was now descending with shame and guilt into the grave;</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      his mind was humbled by the contrast of the past, and justly</a>

<a id='line_1790'>      his mouth armed with long sharp teeth, which threatened to devour</a>

<a id='line_1792'>      lay, trembling with aguish cold, under a weight of bed-clothes,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      he expressed, in broken murmurs to his physician Elpidius, his</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      deep repentance for the murders of Boethius and Symmachus. 103</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      His malady increased, and after a dysentery which continued three</a>

<a id='line_1799'>      end, he divided his treasures and provinces between his two</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      grandsons, and fixed the Rhone as their common boundary. 104</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      Amalaric was restored to the throne of Spain. Italy, with all the</a>

<a id='line_1808'>      loyalty to the young prince, and to his guardian mother; and</a>
