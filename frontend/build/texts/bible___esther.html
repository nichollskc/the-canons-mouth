                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of Esther</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus</a>
<a id='line_4'>which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and</a>
<a id='line_5'>seven and twenty provinces:) 1:2 That in those days, when the king</a>
<a id='line_6'>Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the</a>
<a id='line_7'>palace, 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all</a>
<a id='line_8'>his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the</a>
<a id='line_9'>nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: 1:4 When he</a>
<a id='line_10'>shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his</a>
<a id='line_11'>excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all</a>
<a id='line_14'>the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great</a>
<a id='line_15'>and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s</a>
<a id='line_16'>palace; 1:6 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with</a>
<a id='line_17'>cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble:</a>
<a id='line_18'>the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue,</a>
<a id='line_19'>and white, and black, marble.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:7 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being</a>
<a id='line_22'>diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to</a>
<a id='line_23'>the state of the king.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:8 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so</a>
<a id='line_26'>the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they</a>
<a id='line_27'>should do according to every man’s pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal</a>
<a id='line_30'>house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with</a>
<a id='line_33'>wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,</a>
<a id='line_34'>Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence</a>
<a id='line_35'>of Ahasuerus the king, 1:11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king</a>
<a id='line_36'>with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty:</a>
<a id='line_37'>for she was fair to look on.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by</a>
<a id='line_40'>his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger</a>
<a id='line_41'>burned in him.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:13 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so</a>
<a id='line_44'>was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment: 1:14 And</a>
<a id='line_45'>the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,</a>
<a id='line_46'>Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw</a>
<a id='line_47'>the king’s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) 1:15 What</a>
<a id='line_48'>shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath</a>
<a id='line_49'>not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the</a>
<a id='line_50'>chamberlains?  1:16 And Memucan answered before the king and the</a>
<a id='line_51'>princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but</a>
<a id='line_52'>also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the</a>
<a id='line_53'>provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:17 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so</a>
<a id='line_56'>that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be</a>
<a id='line_57'>reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought</a>
<a id='line_58'>in before him, but she came not.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>1:18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto</a>
<a id='line_61'>all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen.</a>
<a id='line_62'>Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:19 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him,</a>
<a id='line_65'>and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,</a>
<a id='line_66'>that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king</a>
<a id='line_67'>Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is</a>
<a id='line_68'>better than she.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>1:20 And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published</a>
<a id='line_71'>throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give</a>
<a id='line_72'>to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>1:21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did</a>
<a id='line_75'>according to the word of Memucan: 1:22 For he sent letters into all</a>
<a id='line_76'>the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing</a>
<a id='line_77'>thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man</a>
<a id='line_78'>should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published</a>
<a id='line_79'>according to the language of every people.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:1 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,</a>
<a id='line_82'>he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed</a>
<a id='line_83'>against her.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:2 Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there</a>
<a id='line_86'>be fair young virgins sought for the king: 2:3 And let the king</a>
<a id='line_87'>appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may</a>
<a id='line_88'>gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to</a>
<a id='line_89'>the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king’s</a>
<a id='line_90'>chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for</a>
<a id='line_91'>purification be given them: 2:4 And let the maiden which pleaseth the</a>
<a id='line_92'>king be queen instead of Vashti.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>2:5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_97'>Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a</a>
<a id='line_98'>Benjamite; 2:6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the</a>
<a id='line_99'>captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah,</a>
<a id='line_100'>whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter:</a>
<a id='line_103'>for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and</a>
<a id='line_104'>beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took</a>
<a id='line_105'>for his own daughter.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>2:8 So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was</a>
<a id='line_108'>heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the</a>
<a id='line_109'>palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the</a>
<a id='line_110'>king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and</a>
<a id='line_113'>he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as</a>
<a id='line_114'>belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her,</a>
<a id='line_115'>out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the</a>
<a id='line_116'>best place of the house of the women.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai</a>
<a id='line_119'>had charged her that she should not shew it.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s</a>
<a id='line_122'>house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>2:12 Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,</a>
<a id='line_125'>after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the</a>
<a id='line_126'>women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to</a>
<a id='line_127'>wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours,</a>
<a id='line_128'>and with other things for the purifying of the women;) 2:13 Then thus</a>
<a id='line_129'>came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her</a>
<a id='line_130'>to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>2:14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the</a>
<a id='line_133'>second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s</a>
<a id='line_134'>chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no</a>
<a id='line_135'>more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by</a>
<a id='line_136'>name.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>2:15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of</a>
<a id='line_139'>Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto</a>
<a id='line_140'>the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain,</a>
<a id='line_141'>the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the</a>
<a id='line_142'>sight of all them that looked upon her.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>2:16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in</a>
<a id='line_145'>the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his</a>
<a id='line_146'>reign.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained</a>
<a id='line_149'>grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he</a>
<a id='line_150'>set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of</a>
<a id='line_151'>Vashti.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>2:18 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his</a>
<a id='line_154'>servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces,</a>
<a id='line_155'>and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>2:19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then</a>
<a id='line_158'>Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>2:20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai</a>
<a id='line_161'>had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as</a>
<a id='line_162'>when she was brought up with him.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>2:21 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the</a>
<a id='line_165'>king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door,</a>
<a id='line_166'>were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>2:22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the</a>
<a id='line_169'>queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>2:23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;</a>
<a id='line_172'>therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the</a>
<a id='line_173'>book of the chronicles before the king.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of</a>
<a id='line_176'>Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all</a>
<a id='line_177'>the princes that were with him.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>3:2 And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed,</a>
<a id='line_180'>and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him.</a>
<a id='line_181'>But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>3:3 Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto</a>
<a id='line_184'>Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?  3:4 Now it</a>
<a id='line_185'>came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not</a>
<a id='line_186'>unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters</a>
<a id='line_187'>would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>3:5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,</a>
<a id='line_190'>then was Haman full of wrath.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>3:6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had</a>
<a id='line_193'>shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy</a>
<a id='line_194'>all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even</a>
<a id='line_195'>the people of Mordecai.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year</a>
<a id='line_198'>of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from</a>
<a id='line_199'>day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is,</a>
<a id='line_200'>the month Adar.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>3:8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people</a>
<a id='line_203'>scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces</a>
<a id='line_204'>of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither</a>
<a id='line_205'>keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit</a>
<a id='line_206'>to suffer them.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>3:9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be</a>
<a id='line_209'>destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands</a>
<a id='line_210'>of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the</a>
<a id='line_211'>king’s treasuries.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>3:10 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman</a>
<a id='line_214'>the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>3:11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the</a>
<a id='line_217'>people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>3:12 Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the</a>
<a id='line_220'>first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had</a>
<a id='line_221'>commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were</a>
<a id='line_222'>over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every</a>
<a id='line_223'>province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after</a>
<a id='line_224'>their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and</a>
<a id='line_225'>sealed with the king’s ring.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>3:13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces,</a>
<a id='line_228'>to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and</a>
<a id='line_229'>old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth</a>
<a id='line_230'>day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the</a>
<a id='line_231'>spoil of them for a prey.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>3:14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every</a>
<a id='line_234'>province was published unto all people, that they should be ready</a>
<a id='line_235'>against that day.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>3:15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and</a>
<a id='line_238'>the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat</a>
<a id='line_239'>down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>4:1 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his</a>
<a id='line_242'>clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst</a>
<a id='line_243'>of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 4:2 And came even</a>
<a id='line_244'>before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the king’s gate</a>
<a id='line_245'>clothed with sackcloth.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>4:3 And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and</a>
<a id='line_248'>his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting,</a>
<a id='line_249'>and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>4:4 So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then</a>
<a id='line_252'>was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe</a>
<a id='line_253'>Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it</a>
<a id='line_254'>not.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>4:5 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains,</a>
<a id='line_257'>whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment</a>
<a id='line_258'>to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>4:6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,</a>
<a id='line_261'>which was before the king’s gate.</a>
<a id='line_262'></a>
<a id='line_263'>4:7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of</a>
<a id='line_264'>the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s</a>
<a id='line_265'>treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>4:8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was</a>
<a id='line_268'>given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to</a>
<a id='line_269'>declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the</a>
<a id='line_270'>king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him</a>
<a id='line_271'>for her people.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>4:9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>4:10 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto</a>
<a id='line_276'>Mordecai; 4:11 All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s</a>
<a id='line_277'>provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come</a>
<a id='line_278'>unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one</a>
<a id='line_279'>law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall</a>
<a id='line_280'>hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been</a>
<a id='line_281'>called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>4:12 And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>4:13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself</a>
<a id='line_286'>that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>4:14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall</a>
<a id='line_289'>there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another</a>
<a id='line_290'>place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who</a>
<a id='line_291'>knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</a>
<a id='line_292'>4:15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 4:16 Go,</a>
<a id='line_293'>gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye</a>
<a id='line_294'>for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and</a>
<a id='line_295'>my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,</a>
<a id='line_296'>which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>4:17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther</a>
<a id='line_299'>had commanded him.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>5:1 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal</a>
<a id='line_302'>apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over</a>
<a id='line_303'>against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in</a>
<a id='line_304'>the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>5:2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the</a>
<a id='line_307'>court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to</a>
<a id='line_308'>Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near,</a>
<a id='line_309'>and touched the top of the sceptre.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>5:3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and</a>
<a id='line_312'>what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the</a>
<a id='line_313'>kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>5:4 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king</a>
<a id='line_316'>and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>5:5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as</a>
<a id='line_319'>Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that</a>
<a id='line_320'>Esther had prepared.</a>
<a id='line_321'></a>
<a id='line_322'>5:6 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy</a>
<a id='line_323'>petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even</a>
<a id='line_324'>to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>5:7 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 5:8</a>
<a id='line_327'>If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the</a>
<a id='line_328'>king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and</a>
<a id='line_329'>Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do</a>
<a id='line_330'>to morrow as the king hath said.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>5:9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but</a>
<a id='line_333'>when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor</a>
<a id='line_334'>moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>5:10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he</a>
<a id='line_337'>sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>5:11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude</a>
<a id='line_340'>of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him,</a>
<a id='line_341'>and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the</a>
<a id='line_342'>king.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>5:12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in</a>
<a id='line_345'>with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and</a>
<a id='line_346'>to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>5:13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the</a>
<a id='line_349'>Jew sitting at the king’s gate.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>5:14 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a</a>
<a id='line_352'>gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto</a>
<a id='line_353'>the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily</a>
<a id='line_354'>with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he</a>
<a id='line_355'>caused the gallows to be made.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>6:1 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring</a>
<a id='line_358'>the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the</a>
<a id='line_359'>king.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>6:2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and</a>
<a id='line_362'>Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who</a>
<a id='line_363'>sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>6:3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to</a>
<a id='line_366'>Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto</a>
<a id='line_367'>him, There is nothing done for him.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>6:4 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into</a>
<a id='line_370'>the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang</a>
<a id='line_371'>Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>6:5 And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in</a>
<a id='line_374'>the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>6:6 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done</a>
<a id='line_377'>unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in</a>
<a id='line_378'>his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to</a>
<a id='line_379'>myself?  6:7 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king</a>
<a id='line_380'>delighteth to honour, 6:8 Let the royal apparel be brought which the</a>
<a id='line_381'>king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the</a>
<a id='line_382'>crown royal which is set upon his head: 6:9 And let this apparel and</a>
<a id='line_383'>horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble</a>
<a id='line_384'>princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth</a>
<a id='line_385'>to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city,</a>
<a id='line_386'>and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the</a>
<a id='line_387'>king delighteth to honour.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>6:10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and</a>
<a id='line_390'>the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that</a>
<a id='line_391'>sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_392'>spoken.</a>
<a id='line_393'></a>
<a id='line_394'>6:11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,</a>
<a id='line_395'>and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and</a>
<a id='line_396'>proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the</a>
<a id='line_397'>king delighteth to honour.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>6:12 And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to</a>
<a id='line_400'>his house mourning, and having his head covered.</a>
<a id='line_401'></a>
<a id='line_402'>6:13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing</a>
<a id='line_403'>that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto</a>
<a id='line_404'>him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast</a>
<a id='line_405'>begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely</a>
<a id='line_406'>fall before him.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>6:14 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s</a>
<a id='line_409'>chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther</a>
<a id='line_410'>had prepared.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>7:1 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>7:2 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the</a>
<a id='line_415'>banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be</a>
<a id='line_416'>granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even</a>
<a id='line_417'>to the half of the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>7:3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in</a>
<a id='line_420'>thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me</a>
<a id='line_421'>at my petition, and my people at my request: 7:4 For we are sold, I</a>
<a id='line_422'>and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we</a>
<a id='line_423'>had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue,</a>
<a id='line_424'>although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.</a>
<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>7:5 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen,</a>
<a id='line_427'>Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</a>
<a id='line_428'>7:6 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.</a>
<a id='line_429'>Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>7:7 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went</a>
<a id='line_432'>into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his</a>
<a id='line_433'>life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined</a>
<a id='line_434'>against him by the king.</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>7:8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of</a>
<a id='line_437'>the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther</a>
<a id='line_438'>was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the</a>
<a id='line_439'>house? As the word went out of king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s</a>
<a id='line_440'>face.</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>7:9 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,</a>
<a id='line_443'>Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for</a>
<a id='line_444'>Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of</a>
<a id='line_445'>Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</a>
<a id='line_446'></a>
<a id='line_447'>7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for</a>
<a id='line_448'>Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.</a>
<a id='line_449'></a>
<a id='line_450'>8:1 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the</a>
<a id='line_451'>Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king;</a>
<a id='line_452'>for Esther had told what he was unto her.</a>
<a id='line_453'></a>
<a id='line_454'>8:2 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and</a>
<a id='line_455'>gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of</a>
<a id='line_456'>Haman.</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>8:3 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his</a>
<a id='line_459'>feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman</a>
<a id='line_460'>the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>8:4 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther</a>
<a id='line_463'>arose, and stood before the king, 8:5 And said, If it please the king,</a>
<a id='line_464'>and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the</a>
<a id='line_465'>king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the</a>
<a id='line_466'>letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he</a>
<a id='line_467'>wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king’s provinces: 8:6</a>
<a id='line_468'>For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?</a>
<a id='line_469'>or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?  8:7 Then</a>
<a id='line_470'>the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew,</a>
<a id='line_471'>Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have</a>
<a id='line_472'>hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>8:8 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name,</a>
<a id='line_475'>and seal it with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in</a>
<a id='line_476'>the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>8:9 Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third</a>
<a id='line_479'>month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day</a>
<a id='line_480'>thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded</a>
<a id='line_481'>unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of</a>
<a id='line_482'>the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty</a>
<a id='line_483'>and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing</a>
<a id='line_484'>thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews</a>
<a id='line_485'>according to their writing, and according to their language.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>8:10 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the</a>
<a id='line_488'>king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on</a>
<a id='line_489'>mules, camels, and young dromedaries: 8:11 Wherein the king granted</a>
<a id='line_490'>the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and</a>
<a id='line_491'>to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish,</a>
<a id='line_492'>all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both</a>
<a id='line_493'>little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 8:12</a>
<a id='line_494'>Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the</a>
<a id='line_495'>thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>8:13 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every</a>
<a id='line_498'>province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be</a>
<a id='line_499'>ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>8:14 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being</a>
<a id='line_502'>hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was</a>
<a id='line_503'>given at Shushan the palace.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>8:15 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal</a>
<a id='line_506'>apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a</a>
<a id='line_507'>garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and</a>
<a id='line_508'>was glad.</a>
<a id='line_509'></a>
<a id='line_510'>8:16 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>8:17 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the</a>
<a id='line_513'>king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness,</a>
<a id='line_514'>a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became</a>
<a id='line_515'>Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>9:1 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the</a>
<a id='line_518'>thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree</a>
<a id='line_519'>drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the</a>
<a id='line_520'>Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the</a>
<a id='line_521'>contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) 9:2 The</a>
<a id='line_522'>Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the</a>
<a id='line_523'>provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their</a>
<a id='line_524'>hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon</a>
<a id='line_525'>all people.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>9:3 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the</a>
<a id='line_528'>deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear</a>
<a id='line_529'>of Mordecai fell upon them.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>9:4 For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out</a>
<a id='line_532'>throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and</a>
<a id='line_533'>greater.</a>
<a id='line_534'></a>
<a id='line_535'>9:5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the</a>
<a id='line_536'>sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto</a>
<a id='line_537'>those that hated them.</a>
<a id='line_538'></a>
<a id='line_539'>9:6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred</a>
<a id='line_540'>men.</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>9:7 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 9:8 And Poratha, and</a>
<a id='line_543'>Adalia, and Aridatha, 9:9 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and</a>
<a id='line_544'>Vajezatha, 9:10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy</a>
<a id='line_545'>of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>9:11 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the</a>
<a id='line_548'>palace was brought before the king.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>9:12 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and</a>
<a id='line_551'>destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of</a>
<a id='line_552'>Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now</a>
<a id='line_553'>what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy</a>
<a id='line_554'>request further? and it shall be done.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>9:13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the</a>
<a id='line_557'>Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this</a>
<a id='line_558'>day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</a>
<a id='line_559'></a>
<a id='line_560'>9:14 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given</a>
<a id='line_561'>at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.</a>
<a id='line_562'></a>
<a id='line_563'>9:15 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on</a>
<a id='line_564'>the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men</a>
<a id='line_565'>at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</a>
<a id='line_566'></a>
<a id='line_567'>9:16 But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered</a>
<a id='line_568'>themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from</a>
<a id='line_569'>their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but</a>
<a id='line_570'>they laid not their hands on the prey, 9:17 On the thirteenth day of</a>
<a id='line_571'>the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and</a>
<a id='line_572'>made it a day of feasting and gladness.</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>9:18 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the</a>
<a id='line_575'>thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the</a>
<a id='line_576'>fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting</a>
<a id='line_577'>and gladness.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>9:19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled</a>
<a id='line_580'>towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and</a>
<a id='line_581'>feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>9:20 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the</a>
<a id='line_584'>Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh</a>
<a id='line_585'>and far, 9:21 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the</a>
<a id='line_586'>fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same,</a>
<a id='line_587'>yearly, 9:22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies,</a>
<a id='line_588'>and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from</a>
<a id='line_589'>mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting</a>
<a id='line_590'>and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the</a>
<a id='line_591'>poor.</a>
<a id='line_592'></a>
<a id='line_593'>9:23 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai</a>
<a id='line_594'>had written unto them; 9:24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the</a>
<a id='line_595'>Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to</a>
<a id='line_596'>destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and</a>
<a id='line_597'>to destroy them; 9:25 But when Esther came before the king, he</a>
<a id='line_598'>commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against</a>
<a id='line_599'>the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons</a>
<a id='line_600'>should be hanged on the gallows.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>9:26 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.</a>
<a id='line_603'></a>
<a id='line_604'>Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had</a>
<a id='line_605'>seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them, 9:27 The</a>
<a id='line_606'>Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all</a>
