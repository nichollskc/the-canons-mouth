<a id='line_1'>      I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>     Civil Wars, And Ruin Of The Greek Empire.—Reigns Of Andronicus,</a>
<a id='line_4'>     The Elder And Younger, And John Palæologus.— Regency, Revolt,</a>
<a id='line_5'>     Reign, And Abdication Of John Cantacuzene.— Establishment Of A</a>
<a id='line_6'>     Genoese Colony At Pera Or Galata.—Their Wars With The Empire And</a>
<a id='line_7'>     City Of Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      The long reign of Andronicus 1 the elder is chiefly memorable by</a>
<a id='line_10'>      the disputes of the Greek church, the invasion of the Catalans,</a>
<a id='line_11'>      and the rise of the Ottoman power. He is celebrated as the most</a>
<a id='line_12'>      learned and virtuous prince of the age; but such virtue, and such</a>
<a id='line_13'>      learning, contributed neither to the perfection of the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      individual, nor to the happiness of society. A slave of the most</a>
<a id='line_15'>      abject superstition, he was surrounded on all sides by visible</a>
<a id='line_16'>      and invisible enemies; nor were the flames of hell less dreadful</a>
<a id='line_17'>      to his fancy, than those of a Catalan or Turkish war. Under the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      reign of the Palæologi, the choice of the patriarch was the most</a>
<a id='line_19'>      important business of the state; the heads of the Greek church</a>
<a id='line_20'>      were ambitious and fanatic monks; and their vices or virtues,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      their learning or ignorance, were equally mischievous or</a>
<a id='line_22'>      contemptible. By his intemperate discipline, the patriarch</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Athanasius 2 excited the hatred of the clergy and people: he was</a>
<a id='line_24'>      heard to declare, that the sinner should swallow the last dregs</a>
<a id='line_25'>      of the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was propagated of his</a>
<a id='line_26'>      punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the lettuce of a</a>
<a id='line_27'>      convent garden. Driven from the throne by the universal clamor,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      Athanasius composed before his retreat two papers of a very</a>
<a id='line_29'>      opposite cast. His public testament was in the tone of charity</a>
<a id='line_30'>      and resignation; the private codicil breathed the direst</a>
<a id='line_31'>      anathemas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded</a>
<a id='line_32'>      forever from the communion of the holy trinity, the angels, and</a>
<a id='line_33'>      the saints. This last paper he enclosed in an earthen pot, which</a>
<a id='line_34'>      was placed, by his order, on the top of one of the pillars, in</a>
<a id='line_35'>      the dome of St. Sophia, in the distant hope of discovery and</a>
<a id='line_36'>      revenge. At the end of four years, some youths, climbing</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>       by a ladder in search of pigeons’ nests, detected the fatal</a>
<a id='line_39'>       secret; and,</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>      as Andronicus felt himself touched and bound by the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      excommunication, he trembled on the brink of the abyss which had</a>
<a id='line_43'>      been so treacherously dug under his feet. A synod of bishops was</a>
<a id='line_44'>      instantly convened to debate this important question: the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      rashness of these clandestine anathemas was generally condemned;</a>
<a id='line_46'>      but as the knot could be untied only by the same hand, as that</a>
<a id='line_47'>      hand was now deprived of the crosier, it appeared that this</a>
<a id='line_48'>      posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly power. Some</a>
<a id='line_49'>      faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were extorted from the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      author of the mischief; but the conscience of the emperor was</a>
<a id='line_51'>      still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardor than Athanasius</a>
<a id='line_52'>      himself, the restoration of a patriarch, by whom alone he could</a>
<a id='line_53'>      be healed. At the dead of night, a monk rudely knocked at the</a>
<a id='line_54'>      door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague</a>
<a id='line_55'>      and famine, of inundations and earthquakes. Andronicus started</a>
<a id='line_56'>      from his bed, and spent the night in prayer, till he felt, or</a>
<a id='line_57'>      thought that he felt, a slight motion of the earth. The emperor</a>
<a id='line_58'>      on foot led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanasius; and,</a>
<a id='line_59'>      after a proper resistance, the saint, from whom this message had</a>
<a id='line_60'>      been sent, consented to absolve the prince, and govern the church</a>
<a id='line_61'>      of Constantinople. Untamed by disgrace, and hardened by solitude,</a>
<a id='line_62'>      the shepherd was again odious to the flock, and his enemies</a>
<a id='line_63'>      contrived a singular, and as it proved, a successful, mode of</a>
<a id='line_64'>      revenge. In the night, they stole away the footstool or</a>
<a id='line_65'>      foot-cloth of his throne, which they secretly replaced with the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      decoration of a satirical picture. The emperor was painted with a</a>
<a id='line_67'>      bridle in his mouth, and Athanasius leading the tractable beast</a>
<a id='line_68'>      to the feet of Christ. The authors of the libel were detected and</a>
<a id='line_69'>      punished; but as their lives had been spared, the Christian</a>
<a id='line_70'>      priest in sullen indignation retired to his cell; and the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_71'>      Andronicus, which had been opened for a moment, were again closed</a>
<a id='line_72'>      by his successor.</a>

<a id='line_74'>      1 (return) [ Andronicus himself will justify our freedom in the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      invective, (Nicephorus Gregoras, l. i. c. i.,) which he</a>
<a id='line_76'>      pronounced against historic falsehood. It is true, that his</a>
<a id='line_77'>      censure is more pointedly urged against calumny than against</a>
<a id='line_78'>      adulation.]</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>      2 (return) [ For the anathema in the pigeon’s nest, see Pachymer,</a>

<a id='line_82'>      (l. viii. c. 13—16, 20, 24, l. x. c. 27—29, 31—36, l. xi. c. 1—3,</a>

<a id='line_84'>      Gregoras, (l. vi. c. 5, 7, l. vii. c. 1, 9,) who includes the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      second retreat of this second Chrysostom.]</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>      If this transaction be one of the most curious and important of a</a>
<a id='line_88'>      reign of fifty years, I cannot at least accuse the brevity of my</a>
<a id='line_89'>      materials, since I reduce into some few pages the enormous folios</a>
<a id='line_90'>      of Pachymer, 3 Cantacuzene, 4 and Nicephorus Gregoras, 5 who have</a>
<a id='line_91'>      composed the prolix and languid story of the times. The name and</a>
<a id='line_92'>      situation of the emperor John Cantacuzene might inspire the most</a>
<a id='line_93'>      lively curiosity. His memorials of forty years extend from the</a>
<a id='line_94'>      revolt of the younger Andronicus to his own abdication of the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      empire; and it is observed, that, like Moses and Cæsar, he was</a>
<a id='line_96'>      the principal actor in the scenes which he describes. But in this</a>
<a id='line_97'>      eloquent work we should vainly seek the sincerity of a hero or a</a>
<a id='line_98'>      penitent. Retired in a cloister from the vices and passions of</a>
<a id='line_99'>      the world, he presents not a confession, but an apology, of the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      life of an ambitious statesman. Instead of unfolding the true</a>
<a id='line_101'>      counsels and characters of men, he displays the smooth and</a>
<a id='line_102'>      specious surface of events, highly varnished with his own praises</a>
<a id='line_103'>      and those of his friends. Their motives are always pure; their</a>
<a id='line_104'>      ends always legitimate: they conspire and rebel without any views</a>
<a id='line_105'>      of interest; and the violence which they inflict or suffer is</a>
<a id='line_106'>      celebrated as the spontaneous effect of reason and virtue.</a>

<a id='line_117'>      eight last years of the elder Andronicus. The ingenious</a>
<a id='line_118'>      comparison with Moses and Cæsar is fancied by his French</a>

<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>      5 (return) [ Nicephorus Gregoras more briefly includes the entire</a>
<a id='line_122'>      life and reign of Andronicus the elder, (l. vi. c. 1, p. 96—291.)</a>
<a id='line_123'>      This is the part of which Cantacuzene complains as a false and</a>
<a id='line_124'>      malicious representation of his conduct.]</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>      After the example of the first of the Palæologi, the elder</a>
<a id='line_127'>      Andronicus associated his son Michael to the honors of the</a>
<a id='line_128'>      purple; and from the age of eighteen to his premature death, that</a>
<a id='line_129'>      prince was acknowledged, above twenty-five years, as the second</a>
<a id='line_130'>      emperor of the Greeks. 6 At the head of an army, he excited</a>
<a id='line_131'>      neither the fears of the enemy, nor the jealousy of the court;</a>
<a id='line_132'>      his modesty and patience were never tempted to compute the years</a>
<a id='line_133'>      of his father; nor was that father compelled to repent of his</a>
<a id='line_134'>      liberality either by the virtues or vices of his son. The son of</a>
<a id='line_135'>      Michael was named Andronicus from his grandfather, to whose early</a>
<a id='line_136'>      favor he was introduced by that nominal resemblance. The blossoms</a>
<a id='line_137'>      of wit and beauty increased the fondness of the elder Andronicus;</a>
<a id='line_138'>      and, with the common vanity of age, he expected to realize in the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      second, the hope which had been disappointed in the first,</a>
<a id='line_140'>      generation. The boy was educated in the palace as an heir and a</a>
<a id='line_141'>      favorite; and in the oaths and acclamations of the people, the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      _august triad_ was formed by the names of the father, the son,</a>
<a id='line_143'>      and the grandson. But the younger Andronicus was speedily</a>
<a id='line_144'>      corrupted by his infant greatness, while he beheld with puerile</a>
<a id='line_145'>      impatience the double obstacle that hung, and might long hang,</a>
<a id='line_146'>      over his rising ambition. It was not to acquire fame, or to</a>
<a id='line_147'>      diffuse happiness, that he so eagerly aspired: wealth and</a>
<a id='line_148'>      impunity were in his eyes the most precious attributes of a</a>
<a id='line_149'>      monarch; and his first indiscreet demand was the sovereignty of</a>
<a id='line_150'>      some rich and fertile island, where he might lead a life of</a>
<a id='line_151'>      independence and pleasure. The emperor was offended by the loud</a>
<a id='line_152'>      and frequent intemperance which disturbed his capital; the sums</a>
<a id='line_153'>      which his parsimony denied were supplied by the Genoese usurers</a>
<a id='line_154'>      of Pera; and the oppressive debt, which consolidated the interest</a>
<a id='line_155'>      of a faction, could be discharged only by a revolution. A</a>
<a id='line_156'>      beautiful female, a matron in rank, a prostitute in manners, had</a>
<a id='line_157'>      instructed the younger Andronicus in the rudiments of love; but</a>
<a id='line_158'>      he had reason to suspect the nocturnal visits of a rival; and a</a>
<a id='line_159'>      stranger passing through the street was pierced by the arrows of</a>
<a id='line_160'>      his guards, who were placed in ambush at her door. That stranger</a>
<a id='line_161'>      was his brother, Prince Manuel, who languished and died of his</a>
<a id='line_162'>      wound; and the emperor Michael, their common father, whose health</a>
<a id='line_163'>      was in a declining state, expired on the eighth day, lamenting</a>
<a id='line_164'>      the loss of both his children. 7 However guiltless in his</a>
<a id='line_165'>      intention, the younger Andronicus might impute a brother’s and a</a>
<a id='line_166'>      father’s death to the consequence of his own vices; and deep was</a>
<a id='line_167'>      the sigh of thinking and feeling men, when they perceived,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      instead of sorrow and repentance, his ill-dissembled joy on the</a>
<a id='line_169'>      removal of two odious competitors. By these melancholy events,</a>
<a id='line_170'>      and the increase of his disorders, the mind of the elder emperor</a>
<a id='line_171'>      was gradually alienated; and, after many fruitless reproofs, he</a>
<a id='line_172'>      transferred on another grandson 8 his hopes and affection. The</a>
<a id='line_173'>      change was announced by the new oath of allegiance to the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      reigning sovereign, and the _person_ whom he should appoint for</a>
<a id='line_175'>      his successor; and the acknowledged heir, after a repetition of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      insults and complaints, was exposed to the indignity of a public</a>
<a id='line_177'>      trial. Before the sentence, which would probably have condemned</a>
<a id='line_178'>      him to a dungeon or a cell, the emperor was informed that the</a>
<a id='line_179'>      palace courts were filled with the armed followers of his</a>
<a id='line_180'>      grandson; the judgment was softened to a treaty of</a>
<a id='line_181'>      reconciliation; and the triumphant escape of the prince</a>
<a id='line_182'>      encouraged the ardor of the younger faction.</a>

<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>      Yet the capital, the clergy, and the senate, adhered to the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      person, or at least to the government, of the old emperor; and it</a>
<a id='line_206'>      was only in the provinces, by flight, and revolt, and foreign</a>
<a id='line_207'>      succor, that the malecontents could hope to vindicate their cause</a>
<a id='line_208'>      and subvert his throne. The soul of the enterprise was the great</a>
<a id='line_209'>      domestic John Cantacuzene; the sally from Constantinople is the</a>
<a id='line_210'>      first date of his actions and memorials; and if his own pen be</a>
<a id='line_211'>      most descriptive of his patriotism, an unfriendly historian has</a>
<a id='line_212'>      not refused to celebrate the zeal and ability which he displayed</a>
<a id='line_213'>      in the service of the young emperor. 89 That prince escaped from</a>
<a id='line_214'>      the capital under the pretence of hunting; erected his standard</a>
<a id='line_215'>      at Adrianople; and, in a few days, assembled fifty thousand horse</a>
<a id='line_216'>      and foot, whom neither honor nor duty could have armed against</a>
<a id='line_217'>      the Barbarians. Such a force might have saved or commanded the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      empire; but their counsels were discordant, their motions were</a>
<a id='line_219'>      slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by intrigue and</a>
<a id='line_220'>      negotiation. The quarrel of the two Andronici was protracted, and</a>
<a id='line_221'>      suspended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of seven years.</a>
<a id='line_222'>      In the first treaty, the relics of the Greek empire were divided:</a>
<a id='line_223'>      Constantinople, Thessalonica, and the islands, were left to the</a>
<a id='line_224'>      elder, while the younger acquired the sovereignty of the greatest</a>
<a id='line_225'>      part of Thrace, from Philippi to the Byzantine limit. By the</a>
<a id='line_226'>      second treaty, he stipulated the payment of his troops, his</a>
<a id='line_227'>      immediate coronation, and an adequate share of the power and</a>
<a id='line_228'>      revenue of the state. The third civil war was terminated by the</a>
<a id='line_229'>      surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat of the old emperor,</a>
<a id='line_230'>      and the sole reign of his victorious grandson. The reasons of</a>
<a id='line_231'>      this delay may be found in the characters of the men and of the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      times. When the heir of the monarchy first pleaded his wrongs and</a>
<a id='line_233'>      his apprehensions, he was heard with pity and applause: and his</a>
<a id='line_234'>      adherents repeated on all sides the inconsistent promise, that he</a>
<a id='line_235'>      would increase the pay of the soldiers and alleviate the burdens</a>
<a id='line_236'>      of the people. The grievances of forty years were mingled in his</a>
<a id='line_237'>      revolt; and the rising generation was fatigued by the endless</a>
<a id='line_238'>      prospect of a reign, whose favorites and maxims were of other</a>
<a id='line_239'>      times. The youth of Andronicus had been without spirit, his age</a>
<a id='line_240'>      was without reverence: his taxes produced an unusual revenue of</a>
<a id='line_241'>      five hundred thousand pounds; yet the richest of the sovereigns</a>
<a id='line_242'>      of Christendom was incapable of maintaining three thousand horse</a>
<a id='line_243'>      and twenty galleys, to resist the destructive progress of the</a>
<a id='line_244'>      Turks. 9 “How different,” said the younger Andronicus, “is my</a>
<a id='line_245'>      situation from that of the son of Philip! Alexander might</a>
<a id='line_246'>      complain, that his father would leave him nothing to conquer:</a>

<a id='line_274'>      Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot, and the</a>
<a id='line_275'>      final situation of the principal actors. 10 The age of Andronicus</a>
<a id='line_276'>      was consumed in civil discord; and, amidst the events of war and</a>
<a id='line_277'>      treaty, his power and reputation continually decayed, till the</a>
<a id='line_278'>      fatal night in which the gates of the city and palace were opened</a>
<a id='line_279'>      without resistance to his grandson. His principal commander</a>
<a id='line_280'>      scorned the repeated warnings of danger; and retiring to rest in</a>
<a id='line_281'>      the vain security of ignorance, abandoned the feeble monarch,</a>
<a id='line_282'>      with some priests and pages, to the terrors of a sleepless night.</a>
<a id='line_283'>      These terrors were quickly realized by the hostile shouts, which</a>
<a id='line_284'>      proclaimed the titles and victory of Andronicus the younger; and</a>
<a id='line_285'>      the aged emperor, falling prostrate before an image of the</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Virgin, despatched a suppliant message to resign the sceptre, and</a>
<a id='line_287'>      to obtain his life at the hands of the conqueror. The answer of</a>
<a id='line_288'>      his grandson was decent and pious; at the prayer of his friends,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      the younger Andronicus assumed the sole administration; but the</a>
<a id='line_290'>      elder still enjoyed the name and preeminence of the first</a>
<a id='line_291'>      emperor, the use of the great palace, and a pension of</a>
<a id='line_292'>      twenty-four thousand pieces of gold, one half of which was</a>
<a id='line_293'>      assigned on the royal treasury, and the other on the fishery of</a>
<a id='line_294'>      Constantinople. But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt</a>
<a id='line_295'>      and oblivion; the vast silence of the palace was disturbed only</a>
<a id='line_296'>      by the cattle and poultry of the neighborhood, 101 which roved</a>
<a id='line_297'>      with impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced</a>
<a id='line_298'>      allowance of ten thousand pieces of gold 11 was all that he could</a>
<a id='line_299'>      ask, and more than he could hope. His calamities were imbittered</a>
<a id='line_300'>      by the gradual extinction of sight; his confinement was rendered</a>
<a id='line_301'>      each day more rigorous; and during the absence and sickness of</a>
<a id='line_302'>      his grandson, his inhuman keepers, by the threats of instant</a>

<a id='line_304'>      habit and profession. The monk _Antony_ had renounced the pomp of</a>
<a id='line_305'>      the world; yet he had occasion for a coarse fur in the winter</a>
<a id='line_306'>      season, and as wine was forbidden by his confessor, and water by</a>
<a id='line_307'>      his physician, the sherbet of Egypt was his common drink. It was</a>
<a id='line_308'>      not without difficulty that the late emperor could procure three</a>

<a id='line_357'>      infirmities of age; and after being rescued from a dangerous</a>

<a id='line_360'>      married; and, as the progress of the Latins in arms and arts had</a>
<a id='line_361'>      softened the prejudices of the Byzantine court, his two wives</a>
<a id='line_362'>      were chosen in the princely houses of Germany and Italy. The</a>

<a id='line_366'>      revenue from his silver mines; 17 and his family is celebrated by</a>

<a id='line_514'>      despatched in the first month, informed the provinces of their</a>
<a id='line_515'>      loss and their duty. The prospect of a tranquil minority was</a>
<a id='line_516'>      blasted by the great duke or admiral Apocaucus, and to exaggerate</a>
<a id='line_517'>      _his_ perfidy, the Imperial historian is pleased to magnify his</a>
<a id='line_518'>      own imprudence, in raising him to that office against the advice</a>
<a id='line_519'>      of his more sagacious sovereign. Bold and subtle, rapacious and</a>
<a id='line_520'>      profuse, the avarice and ambition of Apocaucus were by turns</a>
<a id='line_521'>      subservient to each other; and his talents were applied to the</a>
<a id='line_522'>      ruin of his country. His arrogance was heightened by the command</a>
<a id='line_523'>      of a naval force and an impregnable castle, and under the mask of</a>
<a id='line_524'>      oaths and flattery he secretly conspired against his benefactor.</a>
<a id='line_525'>      The female court of the empress was bribed and directed; he</a>
<a id='line_526'>      encouraged Anne of Savoy to assert, by the law of nature, the</a>
<a id='line_527'>      tutelage of her son; the love of power was disguised by the</a>
<a id='line_528'>      anxiety of maternal tenderness: and the founder of the Palæologi</a>
<a id='line_529'>      had instructed his posterity to dread the example of a perfidious</a>
<a id='line_530'>      guardian. The patriarch John of Apri was a proud and feeble old</a>
<a id='line_531'>      man, encompassed by a numerous and hungry kindred. He produced an</a>
<a id='line_532'>      obsolete epistle of Andronicus, which bequeathed the prince and</a>
<a id='line_533'>      people to his pious care: the fate of his predecessor Arsenius</a>
<a id='line_534'>      prompted him to prevent, rather than punish, the crimes of a</a>
<a id='line_535'>      usurper; and Apocaucus smiled at the success of his own flattery,</a>
<a id='line_536'>      when he beheld the Byzantine priest assuming the state and</a>
<a id='line_537'>      temporal claims of the Roman pontiff. 26 Between three persons so</a>
<a id='line_538'>      different in their situation and character, a private league was</a>
<a id='line_539'>      concluded: a shadow of authority was restored to the senate; and</a>
<a id='line_540'>      the people was tempted by the name of freedom. By this powerful</a>
<a id='line_541'>      confederacy, the great domestic was assaulted at first with</a>
<a id='line_542'>      clandestine, at length with open, arms. His prerogatives were</a>
<a id='line_543'>      disputed; his opinions slighted; his friends persecuted; and his</a>
<a id='line_544'>      safety was threatened both in the camp and city. In his absence</a>
<a id='line_545'>      on the public service, he was accused of treason; proscribed as</a>
<a id='line_546'>      an enemy of the church and state; and delivered with all his</a>
<a id='line_547'>      adherents to the sword of justice, the vengeance of the people,</a>
<a id='line_548'>      and the power of the devil; his fortunes were confiscated; his</a>
<a id='line_549'>      aged mother was cast into prison; 261 all his past services were</a>
<a id='line_550'>      buried in oblivion; and he was driven by injustice to perpetrate</a>
<a id='line_551'>      the crime of which he was accused. 27 From the review of his</a>
<a id='line_552'>      preceding conduct, Cantacuzene appears to have been guiltless of</a>
<a id='line_553'>      any treasonable designs; and the only suspicion of his innocence</a>
<a id='line_554'>      must arise from the vehemence of his protestations, and the</a>
<a id='line_555'>      sublime purity which he ascribes to his own virtue. While the</a>
<a id='line_556'>      empress and the patriarch still affected the appearances of</a>
<a id='line_557'>      harmony, he repeatedly solicited the permission of retiring to a</a>
<a id='line_558'>      private, and even a monastic, life. After he had been declared a</a>
<a id='line_559'>      public enemy, it was his fervent wish to throw himself at the</a>
<a id='line_560'>      feet of the young emperor, and to receive without a murmur the</a>
<a id='line_561'>      stroke of the executioner: it was not without reluctance that he</a>

<a id='line_598'>      this act of revolt, he was still studious of loyalty; and the</a>
<a id='line_599'>      titles of John Palæologus and Anne of Savoy were proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_600'>      before his own name and that of his wife Irene. Such vain</a>

<a id='line_604'>      may confirm the assurance of the usurper, that this decisive step</a>
<a id='line_605'>      was the effect of necessity rather than of choice. Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_606'>      adhered to the young emperor; the king of Bulgaria was invited to</a>
<a id='line_607'>      the relief of Adrianople: the principal cities of Thrace and</a>
<a id='line_608'>      Macedonia, after some hesitation, renounced their obedience to</a>
<a id='line_609'>      the great domestic; and the leaders of the troops and provinces</a>
<a id='line_610'>      were induced, by their private interest, to prefer the loose</a>
<a id='line_611'>      dominion of a woman and a priest. 271 The army of Cantacuzene, in</a>
<a id='line_612'>      sixteen divisions, was stationed on the banks of the Melas to</a>
<a id='line_613'>      tempt or to intimidate the capital: it was dispersed by treachery</a>
<a id='line_614'>      or fear; and the officers, more especially the mercenary Latins,</a>
<a id='line_615'>      accepted the bribes, and embraced the service, of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_616'>      court. After this loss, the rebel emperor (he fluctuated between</a>
<a id='line_617'>      the two characters) took the road of Thessalonica with a chosen</a>
<a id='line_618'>      remnant; but he failed in his enterprise on that important place;</a>
<a id='line_619'>      and he was closely pursued by the great duke, his enemy</a>
<a id='line_620'>      Apocaucus, at the head of a superior power by sea and land.</a>
<a id='line_621'>      Driven from the coast, in his march, or rather flight, into the</a>
<a id='line_622'>      mountains of Servia, Cantacuzene assembled his troops to</a>
<a id='line_623'>      scrutinize those who were worthy and willing to accompany his</a>
<a id='line_624'>      broken fortunes. A base majority bowed and retired; and his</a>
<a id='line_625'>      trusty band was diminished to two thousand, and at last to five</a>
<a id='line_626'>      hundred, volunteers. The _cral_, 28 or despot of the Servians</a>
<a id='line_627'>      received him with general hospitality; but the ally was</a>
<a id='line_628'>      insensibly degraded to a suppliant, a hostage, a captive; and in</a>
<a id='line_629'>      this miserable dependence, he waited at the door of the</a>
<a id='line_630'>      Barbarian, who could dispose of the life and liberty of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_631'>      emperor. The most tempting offers could not persuade the cral to</a>
<a id='line_632'>      violate his trust; but he soon inclined to the stronger side; and</a>
<a id='line_633'>      his friend was dismissed without injury to a new vicissitude of</a>
<a id='line_634'>      hopes and perils. Near six years the flame of discord burnt with</a>

<a id='line_639'>      the common ruin. The regent deplored the calamities, of which he</a>
<a id='line_640'>      was the author and victim: and his own experience might dictate a</a>
<a id='line_641'>      just and lively remark on the different nature of foreign and</a>

<a id='line_684'>      passage of the Ottomans into Europe, the last and fatal stroke in</a>
<a id='line_685'>      the fall of the Roman empire. The inclining scale was decided in</a>
<a id='line_686'>      his favor by the death of Apocaucus, the just though singular</a>
<a id='line_687'>      retribution of his crimes. A crowd of nobles or plebeians, whom</a>
<a id='line_688'>      he feared or hated, had been seized by his orders in the capital</a>
<a id='line_689'>      and the provinces; and the old palace of Constantine was assigned</a>
<a id='line_690'>      as the place of their confinement. Some alterations in raising</a>
<a id='line_691'>      the walls, and narrowing the cells, had been ingeniously</a>
<a id='line_692'>      contrived to prevent their escape, and aggravate their misery;</a>
<a id='line_693'>      and the work was incessantly pressed by the daily visits of the</a>
<a id='line_694'>      tyrant. His guards watched at the gate, and as he stood in the</a>
<a id='line_695'>      inner court to overlook the architects, without fear or</a>
<a id='line_696'>      suspicion, he was assaulted and laid breathless on the ground, by</a>
<a id='line_697'>      two 291 resolute prisoners of the Palæologian race, 30 who were</a>
<a id='line_698'>      armed with sticks, and animated by despair. On the rumor of</a>
<a id='line_699'>      revenge and liberty, the captive multitude broke their fetters,</a>
<a id='line_700'>      fortified their prison, and exposed from the battlements the</a>
<a id='line_701'>      tyrant’s head, presuming on the favor of the people and the</a>
<a id='line_702'>      clemency of the empress. Anne of Savoy might rejoice in the fall</a>
<a id='line_703'>      of a haughty and ambitious minister, but while she delayed to</a>
<a id='line_704'>      resolve or to act, the populace, more especially the mariners,</a>
<a id='line_705'>      were excited by the widow of the great duke to a sedition, an</a>
<a id='line_706'>      assault, and a massacre. The prisoners (of whom the far greater</a>
<a id='line_707'>      part were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a</a>
<a id='line_708'>      neighboring church: they were slaughtered at the foot of the</a>
<a id='line_709'>      altar; and in his death the monster was not less bloody and</a>
<a id='line_710'>      venomous than in his life. Yet his talents alone upheld the cause</a>
<a id='line_711'>      of the young emperor; and his surviving associates, suspicious of</a>
<a id='line_712'>      each other, abandoned the conduct of the war, and rejected the</a>
<a id='line_713'>      fairest terms of accommodation. In the beginning of the dispute,</a>
<a id='line_714'>      the empress felt, and complained, that she was deceived by the</a>
<a id='line_715'>      enemies of Cantacuzene: the patriarch was employed to preach</a>
<a id='line_716'>      against the forgiveness of injuries; and her promise of immortal</a>
<a id='line_717'>      hatred was sealed by an oath, under the penalty of</a>
<a id='line_718'>      excommunication. 31 But Anne soon learned to hate without a</a>
<a id='line_719'>      teacher: she beheld the misfortunes of the empire with the</a>
<a id='line_720'>      indifference of a stranger: her jealousy was exasperated by the</a>
<a id='line_721'>      competition of a rival empress; and on the first symptoms of a</a>
<a id='line_722'>      more yielding temper, she threatened the patriarch to convene a</a>
<a id='line_723'>      synod, and degrade him from his office. Their incapacity and</a>
<a id='line_724'>      discord would have afforded the most decisive advantage; but the</a>
<a id='line_725'>      civil war was protracted by the weakness of both parties; and the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      moderation of Cantacuzene has not escaped the reproach of</a>
<a id='line_727'>      timidity and indolence. He successively recovered the provinces</a>
<a id='line_728'>      and cities; and the realm of his pupil was measured by the walls</a>
<a id='line_729'>      of Constantinople; but the metropolis alone counterbalanced the</a>
<a id='line_730'>      rest of the empire; nor could he attempt that important conquest</a>
<a id='line_731'>      till he had secured in his favor the public voice and a private</a>
<a id='line_732'>      correspondence. An Italian, of the name of Facciolati, 32 had</a>
<a id='line_733'>      succeeded to the office of great duke: the ships, the guards, and</a>
<a id='line_734'>      the golden gate, were subject to his command; but his humble</a>
<a id='line_735'>      ambition was bribed to become the instrument of treachery; and</a>
<a id='line_736'>      the revolution was accomplished without danger or bloodshed.</a>
<a id='line_737'>      Destitute of the powers of resistance, or the hope of relief, the</a>
<a id='line_738'>      inflexible Anne would have still defended the palace, and have</a>
<a id='line_739'>      smiled to behold the capital in flames, rather than in the</a>
<a id='line_740'>      possession of a rival. She yielded to the prayers of her friends</a>
<a id='line_741'>      and enemies; and the treaty was dictated by the conqueror, who</a>
<a id='line_742'>      professed a loyal and zealous attachment to the son of his</a>
<a id='line_743'>      benefactor. The marriage of his daughter with John Palæologus was</a>

<a id='line_780'>      He triumphed and reigned; but his reign and triumph were clouded</a>
<a id='line_781'>      by the discontent of his own and the adverse faction. His</a>

<a id='line_783'>      his enemies, and of oblivion for his friends: 35 in his cause</a>
<a id='line_784'>      their estates had been forfeited or plundered; and as they</a>
<a id='line_785'>      wandered naked and hungry through the streets, they cursed the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      selfish generosity of a leader, who, on the throne of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_787'>      might relinquish without merit his private inheritance. The</a>
<a id='line_788'>      adherents of the empress blushed to hold their lives and fortunes</a>
<a id='line_789'>      by the precarious favor of a usurper; and the thirst of revenge</a>
<a id='line_790'>      was concealed by a tender concern for the succession, and even</a>
<a id='line_791'>      the safety, of her son. They were justly alarmed by a petition of</a>
<a id='line_792'>      the friends of Cantacuzene, that they might be released from</a>
<a id='line_793'>      their oath of allegiance to the Palæologi, and intrusted with the</a>
<a id='line_794'>      defence of some cautionary towns; a measure supported with</a>
<a id='line_795'>      argument and eloquence; and which was rejected (says the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_796'>      historian) “by _my_ sublime, and almost incredible virtue.” His</a>
<a id='line_797'>      repose was disturbed by the sound of plots and seditions; and he</a>
<a id='line_798'>      trembled lest the lawful prince should be stolen away by some</a>
<a id='line_799'>      foreign or domestic enemy, who would inscribe his name and his</a>
<a id='line_800'>      wrongs in the banners of rebellion. As the son of Andronicus</a>
<a id='line_801'>      advanced in the years of manhood, he began to feel and to act for</a>
<a id='line_802'>      himself; and his rising ambition was rather stimulated than</a>
<a id='line_803'>      checked by the imitation of his father’s vices. If we may trust</a>
<a id='line_804'>      his own professions, Cantacuzene labored with honest industry to</a>
<a id='line_805'>      correct these sordid and sensual appetites, and to raise the mind</a>
<a id='line_806'>      of the young prince to a level with his fortune. In the Servian</a>
<a id='line_807'>      expedition, the two emperors showed themselves in cordial harmony</a>
<a id='line_808'>      to the troops and provinces; and the younger colleague was</a>
<a id='line_809'>      initiated by the elder in the mysteries of war and government.</a>
<a id='line_810'>      After the conclusion of the peace, Palæologus was left at</a>
<a id='line_811'>      Thessalonica, a royal residence, and a frontier station, to</a>
<a id='line_812'>      secure by his absence the peace of Constantinople, and to</a>
<a id='line_813'>      withdraw his youth from the temptations of a luxurious capital.</a>
<a id='line_814'>      But the distance weakened the powers of control, and the son of</a>
<a id='line_815'>      Andronicus was surrounded with artful or unthinking companions,</a>
<a id='line_816'>      who taught him to hate his guardian, to deplore his exile, and to</a>
<a id='line_817'>      vindicate his rights. A private treaty with the cral or despot of</a>
<a id='line_818'>      Servia was soon followed by an open revolt; and Cantacuzene, on</a>
<a id='line_819'>      the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended the cause of age and</a>
<a id='line_820'>      prerogative, which in his youth he had so vigorously attacked. At</a>
<a id='line_821'>      his request the empress-mother undertook the voyage of</a>
<a id='line_822'>      Thessalonica, and the office of mediation: she returned without</a>
<a id='line_823'>      success; and unless Anne of Savoy was instructed by adversity, we</a>
<a id='line_824'>      may doubt the sincerity, or at least the fervor, of her zeal.</a>
<a id='line_825'>      While the regent grasped the sceptre with a firm and vigorous</a>
<a id='line_826'>      hand, she had been instructed to declare, that the ten years of</a>
<a id='line_827'>      his legal administration would soon elapse; and that, after a</a>
<a id='line_828'>      full trial of the vanity of the world, the emperor Cantacuzene</a>
<a id='line_829'>      sighed for the repose of a cloister, and was ambitious only of a</a>
<a id='line_830'>      heavenly crown. Had these sentiments been genuine, his voluntary</a>
<a id='line_831'>      abdication would have restored the peace of the empire, and his</a>
<a id='line_832'>      conscience would have been relieved by an act of justice.</a>
<a id='line_833'>      Palæologus alone was responsible for his future government; and</a>
<a id='line_834'>      whatever might be his vices, they were surely less formidable</a>
<a id='line_835'>      than the calamities of a civil war, in which the Barbarians and</a>
<a id='line_836'>      infidels were again invited to assist the Greeks in their mutual</a>
<a id='line_837'>      destruction. By the arms of the Turks, who now struck a deep and</a>
<a id='line_838'>      everlasting root in Europe, Cantacuzene prevailed in the third</a>
<a id='line_839'>      contest in which he had been involved; and the young emperor,</a>
<a id='line_840'>      driven from the sea and land, was compelled to take shelter among</a>
<a id='line_841'>      the Latins of the Isle of Tenedos. His insolence and obstinacy</a>
<a id='line_842'>      provoked the victor to a step which must render the quarrel</a>
<a id='line_843'>      irreconcilable; and the association of his son Matthew, whom he</a>
<a id='line_844'>      invested with the purple, established the succession in the</a>
<a id='line_845'>      family of the Cantacuzeni. But Constantinople was still attached</a>
<a id='line_846'>      to the blood of her ancient princes; and this last injury</a>
<a id='line_847'>      accelerated the restoration of the rightful heir. A noble Genoese</a>
<a id='line_848'>      espoused the cause of Palæologus, obtained a promise of his</a>
<a id='line_849'>      sister, and achieved the revolution with two galleys and two</a>
<a id='line_850'>      thousand five hundred auxiliaries. Under the pretence of</a>
<a id='line_851'>      distress, they were admitted into the lesser port; a gate was</a>
<a id='line_852'>      opened, and the Latin shout of, “Long life and victory to the</a>
<a id='line_853'>      emperor, John Palæologus!” was answered by a general rising in</a>
<a id='line_854'>      his favor. A numerous and loyal party yet adhered to the standard</a>
<a id='line_855'>      of Cantacuzene: but he asserts in his history (does he hope for</a>
<a id='line_856'>      belief?) that his tender conscience rejected the assurance of</a>
<a id='line_857'>      conquest; that, in free obedience to the voice of religion and</a>
<a id='line_858'>      philosophy, he descended from the throne and embraced with</a>
<a id='line_859'>      pleasure the monastic habit and profession. 36 So soon as he</a>
<a id='line_860'>      ceased to be a prince, his successor was not unwilling that he</a>
<a id='line_861'>      should be a saint: the remainder of his life was devoted to piety</a>
<a id='line_862'>      and learning; in the cells of Constantinople and Mount Athos, the</a>
<a id='line_863'>      monk Joasaph was respected as the temporal and spiritual father</a>
<a id='line_864'>      of the emperor; and if he issued from his retreat, it was as the</a>
<a id='line_865'>      minister of peace, to subdue the obstinacy, and solicit the</a>
<a id='line_866'>      pardon, of his rebellious son. 37</a>

<a id='line_899'>      zeal the divine light of Mount Thabor, a memorable question which</a>
<a id='line_900'>      consummates the religious follies of the Greeks. The fakirs of</a>
<a id='line_901'>      India, 39 and the monks of the Oriental church, were alike</a>
<a id='line_902'>      persuaded, that in the total abstraction of the faculties of the</a>
<a id='line_903'>      mind and body, the purer spirit may ascend to the enjoyment and</a>
<a id='line_904'>      vision of the Deity. The opinion and practice of the monasteries</a>
<a id='line_905'>      of Mount Athos 40 will be best represented in the words of an</a>
<a id='line_906'>      abbot, who flourished in the eleventh century. “When thou art</a>
<a id='line_907'>      alone in thy cell,” says the ascetic teacher, “shut thy door, and</a>
<a id='line_908'>      seat thyself in a corner: raise thy mind above all things vain</a>
<a id='line_909'>      and transitory; recline thy beard and chin on thy breast; turn</a>
<a id='line_910'>      thy eyes and thy thoughts toward the middle of thy belly, the</a>
<a id='line_911'>      region of the navel; and search the place of the heart, the seat</a>
<a id='line_912'>      of the soul. At first, all will be dark and comfortless; but if</a>
<a id='line_913'>      you persevere day and night, you will feel an ineffable joy; and</a>
<a id='line_914'>      no sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart, than it</a>
<a id='line_915'>      is involved in a mystic and ethereal light.” This light, the</a>
<a id='line_916'>      production of a distempered fancy, the creature of an empty</a>
<a id='line_917'>      stomach and an empty brain, was adored by the Quietists as the</a>
<a id='line_918'>      pure and perfect essence of God himself; and as long as the folly</a>
<a id='line_919'>      was confined to Mount Athos, the simple solitaries were not</a>
<a id='line_920'>      inquisitive how the divine essence could be a _material_</a>
<a id='line_921'>      substance, or how an _immaterial_ substance could be perceived by</a>
<a id='line_922'>      the eyes of the body. But in the reign of the younger Andronicus,</a>
<a id='line_923'>      these monasteries were visited by Barlaam, 41 a Calabrian monk,</a>
<a id='line_924'>      who was equally skilled in philosophy and theology; who possessed</a>
<a id='line_925'>      the language of the Greeks and Latins; and whose versatile genius</a>
<a id='line_926'>      could maintain their opposite creeds, according to the interest</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of the moment. The indiscretion of an ascetic revealed to the</a>
<a id='line_928'>      curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer and Barlaam</a>
<a id='line_929'>      embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists, who placed</a>
<a id='line_930'>      the soul in the navel; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of</a>
<a id='line_931'>      heresy and blasphemy. His attack compelled the more learned to</a>
<a id='line_932'>      renounce or dissemble the simple devotion of their brethren; and</a>
<a id='line_933'>      Gregory Palamas introduced a scholastic distinction between the</a>
<a id='line_934'>      essence and operation of God. His inaccessible essence dwells in</a>
<a id='line_935'>      the midst of an uncreated and eternal light; and this beatific</a>
<a id='line_936'>      vision of the saints had been manifested to the disciples on</a>
<a id='line_937'>      Mount Thabor, in the transfiguration of Christ. Yet this</a>
<a id='line_938'>      distinction could not escape the reproach of polytheism; the</a>
<a id='line_939'>      eternity of the light of Thabor was fiercely denied; and Barlaam</a>
<a id='line_940'>      still charged the Palamites with holding two eternal substances,</a>
<a id='line_941'>      a visible and an invisible God. From the rage of the monks of</a>
<a id='line_942'>      Mount Athos, who threatened his life, the Calabrian retired to</a>
<a id='line_943'>      Constantinople, where his smooth and specious manners introduced</a>
<a id='line_944'>      him to the favor of the great domestic and the emperor. The court</a>
<a id='line_945'>      and the city were involved in this theological dispute, which</a>
<a id='line_946'>      flamed amidst the civil war; but the doctrine of Barlaam was</a>
<a id='line_947'>      disgraced by his flight and apostasy: the Palamites triumphed;</a>
<a id='line_948'>      and their adversary, the patriarch John of Apri, was deposed by</a>
<a id='line_949'>      the consent of the adverse factions of the state. In the</a>
<a id='line_950'>      character of emperor and theologian, Cantacuzene presided in the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      synod of the Greek church, which established, as an article of</a>
<a id='line_952'>      faith, the uncreated light of Mount Thabor; and, after so many</a>
<a id='line_953'>      insults, the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the</a>
<a id='line_954'>      addition of a single absurdity. Many rolls of paper or parchment</a>
<a id='line_955'>      have been blotted; and the impenitent sectaries, who refused to</a>
<a id='line_956'>      subscribe the orthodox creed, were deprived of the honors of</a>

<a id='line_990'>      For the conclusion of this chapter, I have reserved the Genoese</a>
<a id='line_991'>      war, which shook the throne of Cantacuzene, and betrayed the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      debility of the Greek empire. The Genoese, who, after the</a>
<a id='line_993'>      recovery of Constantinople, were seated in the suburb of Pera or</a>
<a id='line_994'>      Galata, received that honorable fief from the bounty of the</a>
<a id='line_995'>      emperor. They were indulged in the use of their laws and</a>
<a id='line_996'>      magistrates; but they submitted to the duties of vassals and</a>
<a id='line_997'>      subjects; the forcible word of _liegemen_43 was borrowed from the</a>
<a id='line_998'>      Latin jurisprudence; and their _podesta_, or chief, before he</a>
<a id='line_999'>      entered on his office, saluted the emperor with loyal</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      acclamations and vows of fidelity. Genoa sealed a firm alliance</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      with the Greeks; and, in case of a defensive war, a supply of</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      fifty empty galleys and a succor of fifty galleys, completely</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      armed and manned, was promised by the republic to the empire. In</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      the revival of a naval force, it was the aim of Michael</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      Palæologus to deliver himself from a foreign aid; and his</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      vigorous government contained the Genoese of Galata within those</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      limits which the insolence of wealth and freedom provoked them to</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      exceed. A sailor threatened that they should soon be masters of</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      Constantinople, and slew the Greek who resented this national</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      affront; and an armed vessel, after refusing to salute the</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      palace, was guilty of some acts of piracy in the Black Sea. Their</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      countrymen threatened to support their cause; but the long and</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      open village of Galata was instantly surrounded by the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      troops; till, in the moment of the assault, the prostrate Genoese</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      implored the clemency of their sovereign. The defenceless</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      situation which secured their obedience exposed them to the</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      attack of their Venetian rivals, who, in the reign of the elder</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      Andronicus, presumed to violate the majesty of the throne. On the</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      approach of their fleets, the Genoese, with their families and</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      effects, retired into the city: their empty habitations were</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      reduced to ashes; and the feeble prince, who had viewed the</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      destruction of his suburb, expressed his resentment, not by arms,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      but by ambassadors. This misfortune, however, was advantageous to</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      the Genoese, who obtained, and imperceptibly abused, the</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      dangerous license of surrounding Galata with a strong wall; of</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      introducing into the ditch the waters of the sea; of erecting</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      lofty turrets; and of mounting a train of military engines on the</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      rampart. The narrow bounds in which they had been circumscribed</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      were insufficient for the growing colony; each day they acquired</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      some addition of landed property; and the adjacent hills were</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      covered with their villas and castles, which they joined and</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      protected by new fortifications. 44 The navigation and trade of</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      the Euxine was the patrimony of the Greek emperors, who commanded</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      the narrow entrance, the gates, as it were, of that inland sea.</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      In the reign of Michael Palæologus, their prerogative was</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      acknowledged by the sultan of Egypt, who solicited and obtained</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      the liberty of sending an annual ship for the purchase of slaves</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      in Circassia and the Lesser Tartary: a liberty pregnant with</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      mischief to the Christian cause; since these youths were</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      transformed by education and discipline into the formidable</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      Mamalukes. 45 From the colony of Pera, the Genoese engaged with</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      superior advantage in the lucrative trade of the Black Sea; and</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      their industry supplied the Greeks with fish and corn; two</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      articles of food almost equally important to a superstitious</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      people. The spontaneous bounty of nature appears to have bestowed</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      the harvests of Ukraine, the produce of a rude and savage</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      husbandry; and the endless exportation of salt fish and caviare</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      is annually renewed by the enormous sturgeons that are caught at</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      the mouth of the Don or Tanais, in their last station of the rich</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      mud and shallow water of the Mæotis. 46 The waters of the Oxus,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      the Caspian, the Volga, and the Don, opened a rare and laborious</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      passage for the gems and spices of India; and after three months’</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      march the caravans of Carizme met the Italian vessels in the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      harbors of Crimæa. 47 These various branches of trade were</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      monopolized by the diligence and power of the Genoese. Their</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      rivals of Venice and Pisa were forcibly expelled; the natives</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      were awed by the castles and cities, which arose on the</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      foundations of their humble factories; and their principal</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      establishment of Caffa 48 was besieged without effect by the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      Tartar powers. Destitute of a navy, the Greeks were oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      these haughty merchants, who fed, or famished, Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      according to their interest. They proceeded to usurp the customs,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      the fishery, and even the toll, of the Bosphorus; and while they</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      derived from these objects a revenue of two hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      pieces of gold, a remnant of thirty thousand was reluctantly</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      allowed to the emperor. 49 The colony of Pera or Galata acted, in</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      peace and war, as an independent state; and, as it will happen in</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      distant settlements, the Genoese podesta too often forgot that he</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      was the servant of his own masters.</a>

<a id='line_1110'>      These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the elder</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflicted his age and the</a>

<a id='line_1113'>      employed to the ruin, rather than the restoration, of the empire;</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      and after his domestic victory, he was condemned to an</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      ignominious trial, whether the Greeks or the Genoese should reign</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      in Constantinople. The merchants of Pera were offended by his</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      refusal of some contiguous land, some commanding heights, which</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      they proposed to cover with new fortifications; and in the</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      absence of the emperor, who was detained at Demotica by sickness,</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      they ventured to brave the debility of a female reign. A</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      Byzantine vessel, which had presumed to fish at the mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      harbor, was sunk by these audacious strangers; the fishermen were</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      murdered. Instead of suing for pardon, the Genoese demanded</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      satisfaction; required, in a haughty strain, that the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      should renounce the exercise of navigation; and encountered with</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      regular arms the first sallies of the popular indignation. They</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      instantly occupied the debatable land; and by the labor of a</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      whole people, of either sex and of every age, the wall was</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      raised, and the ditch was sunk, with incredible speed. At the</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      same time, they attacked and burnt two Byzantine galleys; while</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      the three others, the remainder of the Imperial navy, escaped</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      from their hands: the habitations without the gates, or along the</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      shore, were pillaged and destroyed; and the care of the regent,</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      of the empress Irene, was confined to the preservation of the</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      city. The return of Cantacuzene dispelled the public</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      consternation: the emperor inclined to peaceful counsels; but he</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      yielded to the obstinacy of his enemies, who rejected all</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      reasonable terms, and to the ardor of his subjects, who</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      threatened, in the style of Scripture, to break them in pieces</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      like a potter’s vessel. Yet they reluctantly paid the taxes, that</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      he imposed for the construction of ships, and the expenses of the</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      war; and as the two nations were masters, the one of the land,</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      the other of the sea, Constantinople and Pera were pressed by the</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      evils of a mutual siege. The merchants of the colony, who had</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      believed that a few days would terminate the war, already</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      murmured at their losses: the succors from their mother-country</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      were delayed by the factions of Genoa; and the most cautious</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      embraced the opportunity of a Rhodian vessel to remove their</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      families and effects from the scene of hostility. In the spring,</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      the Byzantine fleet, seven galleys and a train of smaller</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      vessels, issued from the mouth of the harbor, and steered in a</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      single line along the shore of Pera; unskilfully presenting their</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      sides to the beaks of the adverse squadron. The crews were</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      composed of peasants and mechanics; nor was their ignorance</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      compensated by the native courage of Barbarians: the wind was</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      strong, the waves were rough; and no sooner did the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      perceive a distant and inactive enemy, than they leaped headlong</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      into the sea, from a doubtful, to an inevitable peril. The troops</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      that marched to the attack of the lines of Pera were struck at</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      the same moment with a similar panic; and the Genoese were</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      astonished, and almost ashamed, at their double victory. Their</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      triumphant vessels, crowned with flowers, and dragging after them</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      the captive galleys, repeatedly passed and repassed before the</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      palace: the only virtue of the emperor was patience; and the hope</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      of revenge his sole consolation. Yet the distress of both parties</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      interposed a temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire was</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power. Summoning the</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      chiefs of the colony, Cantacuzene affected to despise the trivial</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      object of the debate; and, after a mild reproof, most liberally</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      granted the lands, which had been previously resigned to the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      seeming custody of his officers. 50</a>

<a id='line_1179'>      join his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual enemies of Genoa</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      and her colonies. While he compared the reasons of peace and war,</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      his moderation was provoked by a wanton insult of the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      of Pera, who discharged from their rampart a large stone that</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      fell in the midst of Constantinople. On his just complaint, they</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      coldly blamed the imprudence of their engineer; but the next day</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      the insult was repeated; and they exulted in a second proof that</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      the royal city was not beyond the reach of their artillery.</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      Cantacuzene instantly signed his treaty with the Venetians; but</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      the weight of the Roman empire was scarcely felt in the balance</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      of these opulent and powerful republics. 51 From the Straits of</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      Gibraltar to the mouth of the Tanais, their fleets encountered</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      each other with various success; and a memorable battle was</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      fought in the narrow sea, under the walls of Constantinople. It</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      would not be an easy task to reconcile the accounts of the</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      Greeks, the Venetians, and the Genoese; 52 and while I depend on</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      the narrative of an impartial historian, 53 I shall borrow from</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      each nation the facts that redound to their own disgrace, and the</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      honor of their foes. The Venetians, with their allies the</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      Catalans, had the advantage of number; and their fleet, with the</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      poor addition of eight Byzantine galleys, amounted to</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      seventy-five sail: the Genoese did not exceed sixty-four; but in</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      those times their ships of war were distinguished by the</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      superiority of their size and strength. The names and families of</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      their naval commanders, Pisani and Doria, are illustrious in the</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      annals of their country; but the personal merit of the former was</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      eclipsed by the fame and abilities of his rival. They engaged in</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      tempestuous weather; and the tumultuary conflict was continued</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      from the dawn to the extinction of light. The enemies of the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      Genoese applaud their prowess; the friends of the Venetians are</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      dissatisfied with their behavior; but all parties agree in</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      praising the skill and boldness of the Catalans, 531 who, with</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      many wounds, sustained the brunt of the action. On the separation</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      of the fleets, the event might appear doubtful; but the thirteen</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      Genoese galleys, that had been sunk or taken, were compensated by</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      a double loss of the allies; of fourteen Venetians, ten Catalans,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      and two Greeks; 532 and even the grief of the conquerors</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      expressed the assurance and habit of more decisive victories.</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      Pisani confessed his defeat, by retiring into a fortified harbor,</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      from whence, under the pretext of the orders of the senate, he</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      steered with a broken and flying squadron for the Isle of Candia,</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      and abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea. In a</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      public epistle, 54 addressed to the doge and senate, Petrarch</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      employs his eloquence to reconcile the maritime powers, the two</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      luminaries of Italy. The orator celebrates the valor and victory</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      of the Genoese, the first of men in the exercise of naval war: he</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      drops a tear on the misfortunes of their Venetian brethren; but</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      he exhorts them to pursue with fire and sword the base and</a>
