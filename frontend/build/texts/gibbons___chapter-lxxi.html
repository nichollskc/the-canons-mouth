<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      In the last days of Pope Eugenius the Fourth, 101 two of his</a>
<a id='line_8'>      servants, the learned Poggius 1 and a friend, ascended the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Capitoline hill; reposed themselves among the ruins of columns</a>
<a id='line_10'>      and temples; and viewed from that commanding spot the wide and</a>
<a id='line_11'>      various prospect of desolation. 2 The place and the object gave</a>
<a id='line_12'>      ample scope for moralizing on the vicissitudes of fortune, which</a>
<a id='line_13'>      spares neither man nor the proudest of his works, which buries</a>
<a id='line_14'>      empires and cities in a common grave; and it was agreed, that in</a>
<a id='line_15'>      proportion to her former greatness, the fall of Rome was the more</a>
<a id='line_16'>      awful and deplorable. “Her primeval state, such as she might</a>
<a id='line_17'>      appear in a remote age, when Evander entertained the stranger of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Troy, 3 has been delineated by the fancy of Virgil. This Tarpeian</a>
<a id='line_19'>      rock was then a savage and solitary thicket: in the time of the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      poet, it was crowned with the golden roofs of a temple; the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      temple is overthrown, the gold has been pillaged, the wheel of</a>
<a id='line_22'>      fortune has accomplished her revolution, and the sacred ground is</a>
<a id='line_23'>      again disfigured with thorns and brambles. The hill of the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Capitol, on which we sit, was formerly the head of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_25'>      empire, the citadel of the earth, the terror of kings;</a>
<a id='line_26'>      illustrated by the footsteps of so many triumphs, enriched with</a>
<a id='line_27'>      the spoils and tributes of so many nations. This spectacle of the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      world, how is it fallen! how changed! how defaced! The path of</a>
<a id='line_29'>      victory is obliterated by vines, and the benches of the senators</a>
<a id='line_30'>      are concealed by a dunghill. Cast your eyes on the Palatine hill,</a>
<a id='line_31'>      and seek among the shapeless and enormous fragments the marble</a>
<a id='line_32'>      theatre, the obelisks, the colossal statues, the porticos of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Nero’s palace: survey the other hills of the city, the vacant</a>
<a id='line_34'>      space is interrupted only by ruins and gardens. The forum of the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Roman people, where they assembled to enact their laws and elect</a>
<a id='line_36'>      their magistrates, is now enclosed for the cultivation of</a>
<a id='line_37'>      pot-herbs, or thrown open for the reception of swine and</a>
<a id='line_38'>      buffaloes. The public and private edifices, that were founded for</a>
<a id='line_39'>      eternity, lie prostrate, naked, and broken, like the limbs of a</a>
<a id='line_40'>      mighty giant; and the ruin is the more visible, from the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      stupendous relics that have survived the injuries of time and</a>
<a id='line_42'>      fortune.” 4</a>

<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>      These relics are minutely described by Poggius, one of the first</a>
<a id='line_70'>      who raised his eyes from the monuments of legendary, to those of</a>
<a id='line_71'>      classic, superstition. 5 _1._Besides a bridge, an arch, a</a>
<a id='line_72'>      sepulchre, and the pyramid of Cestius, he could discern, of the</a>
<a id='line_73'>      age of the republic, a double row of vaults, in the salt-office</a>
<a id='line_74'>      of the Capitol, which were inscribed with the name and</a>
<a id='line_75'>      munificence of Catulus. _2._ Eleven temples were visible in some</a>
<a id='line_76'>      degree, from the perfect form of the Pantheon, to the three</a>
<a id='line_77'>      arches and a marble column of the temple of Peace, which</a>
<a id='line_78'>      Vespasian erected after the civil wars and the Jewish triumph.</a>
<a id='line_79'>      _3._ Of the number, which he rashly defines, of seven _thermæ_,</a>
<a id='line_80'>      or public baths, none were sufficiently entire to represent the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      use and distribution of the several parts: but those of</a>
<a id='line_82'>      Diocletian and Antoninus Caracalla still retained the titles of</a>
<a id='line_83'>      the founders, and astonished the curious spectator, who, in</a>
<a id='line_84'>      observing their solidity and extent, the variety of marbles, the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      size and multitude of the columns, compared the labor and expense</a>
<a id='line_86'>      with the use and importance. Of the baths of Constantine, of</a>
<a id='line_87'>      Alexander, of Domitian, or rather of Titus, some vestige might</a>
<a id='line_88'>      yet be found. _4._ The triumphal arches of Titus, Severus, and</a>
<a id='line_89'>      Constantine, were entire, both the structure and the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      inscriptions; a falling fragment was honored with the name of</a>
<a id='line_91'>      Trajan; and two arches, then extant, in the Flaminian way, have</a>
<a id='line_92'>      been ascribed to the baser memory of Faustina and Gallienus. 501</a>
<a id='line_93'>      _5._ After the wonder of the Coliseum, Poggius might have</a>
<a id='line_94'>      overlooked small amphitheatre of brick, most probably for the use</a>
<a id='line_95'>      of the prætorian camp: the theatres of Marcellus and Pompey were</a>
<a id='line_96'>      occupied in a great measure by public and private buildings; and</a>
<a id='line_97'>      in the Circus, Agonalis and Maximus, little more than the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      situation and the form could be investigated. _6._ The columns of</a>
<a id='line_99'>      Trajan and Antonine were still erect; but the Egyptian obelisks</a>
<a id='line_100'>      were broken or buried. A people of gods and heroes, the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      workmanship of art, was reduced to one equestrian figure of gilt</a>
<a id='line_102'>      brass, and to five marble statues, of which the most conspicuous</a>
<a id='line_103'>      were the two horses of Phidias and Praxiteles. _7._ The two</a>
<a id='line_104'>      mausoleums or sepulchres of Augustus and Hadrian could not</a>
<a id='line_105'>      totally be lost: but the former was only visible as a mound of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      earth; and the latter, the castle of St. Angelo, had acquired the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      name and appearance of a modern fortress. With the addition of</a>
<a id='line_108'>      some separate and nameless columns, such were the remains of the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      ancient city; for the marks of a more recent structure might be</a>
<a id='line_110'>      detected in the walls, which formed a circumference of ten miles,</a>
<a id='line_111'>      included three hundred and seventy-nine turrets, and opened into</a>
<a id='line_112'>      the country by thirteen gates.</a>

<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>      This melancholy picture was drawn above nine hundred years after</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the fall of the Western empire, and even of the Gothic kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_124'>      Italy. A long period of distress and anarchy, in which empire,</a>
<a id='line_125'>      and arts, and riches had migrated from the banks of the Tyber,</a>
<a id='line_126'>      was incapable of restoring or adorning the city; and, as all that</a>
<a id='line_127'>      is human must retrograde if it do not advance, every successive</a>
<a id='line_128'>      age must have hastened the ruin of the works of antiquity. To</a>
<a id='line_129'>      measure the progress of decay, and to ascertain, at each æra, the</a>
<a id='line_130'>      state of each edifice, would be an endless and a useless labor;</a>
<a id='line_131'>      and I shall content myself with two observations, which will</a>
<a id='line_132'>      introduce a short inquiry into the general causes and effects.</a>
<a id='line_133'>      _1._ Two hundred years before the eloquent complaint of Poggius,</a>
<a id='line_134'>      an anonymous writer composed a description of Rome. 6 His</a>
<a id='line_135'>      ignorance may repeat the same objects under strange and fabulous</a>
<a id='line_136'>      names. Yet this barbarous topographer had eyes and ears; he could</a>
<a id='line_137'>      observe the visible remains; he could listen to the tradition of</a>
<a id='line_138'>      the people; and he distinctly enumerates seven theatres, eleven</a>
<a id='line_139'>      baths, twelve arches, and eighteen palaces, of which many had</a>
<a id='line_140'>      disappeared before the time of Poggius. It is apparent, that many</a>
<a id='line_141'>      stately monuments of antiquity survived till a late period, 7 and</a>
<a id='line_142'>      that the principles of destruction acted with vigorous and</a>
<a id='line_143'>      increasing energy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</a>
<a id='line_144'>      _2._ The same reflection must be applied to the three last ages;</a>
<a id='line_145'>      and we should vainly seek the Septizonium of Severus; 8 which is</a>
<a id='line_146'>      celebrated by Petrarch and the antiquarians of the sixteenth</a>
<a id='line_147'>      century. While the Roman edifices were still entire, the first</a>
<a id='line_148'>      blows, however weighty and impetuous, were resisted by the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      solidity of the mass and the harmony of the parts; but the</a>
<a id='line_150'>      slightest touch would precipitate the fragments of arches and</a>
<a id='line_151'>      columns, that already nodded to their fall.</a>

<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>      After a diligent inquiry, I can discern four principal causes of</a>
<a id='line_174'>      the ruin of Rome, which continued to operate in a period of more</a>
<a id='line_175'>      than a thousand years. I. The injuries of time and nature. II.</a>
<a id='line_176'>      The hostile attacks of the Barbarians and Christians. III. The</a>
<a id='line_177'>      use and abuse of the materials. And, IV. The domestic quarrels of</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>      I. The art of man is able to construct monuments far more</a>
<a id='line_181'>      permanent than the narrow span of his own existence; yet these</a>
<a id='line_182'>      monuments, like himself, are perishable and frail; and in the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      boundless annals of time, his life and his labors must equally be</a>
<a id='line_184'>      measured as a fleeting moment. Of a simple and solid edifice, it</a>
<a id='line_185'>      is not easy, however, to circumscribe the duration. As the</a>
<a id='line_186'>      wonders of ancient days, the pyramids 9 attracted the curiosity</a>
<a id='line_187'>      of the ancients: a hundred generations, the leaves of autumn,</a>
<a id='line_188'>      have dropped 10 into the grave; and after the fall of the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      Pharaohs and Ptolemies, the Cæsars and caliphs, the same pyramids</a>
<a id='line_190'>      stand erect and unshaken above the floods of the Nile. A complex</a>
<a id='line_191'>      figure of various and minute parts to more accessible to injury</a>
<a id='line_192'>      and decay; and the silent lapse of time is often accelerated by</a>
<a id='line_193'>      hurricanes and earthquakes, by fires and inundations. The air and</a>
<a id='line_194'>      earth have doubtless been shaken; and the lofty turrets of Rome</a>
<a id='line_195'>      have tottered from their foundations; but the seven hills do not</a>
<a id='line_196'>      appear to be placed on the great cavities of the globe; nor has</a>
<a id='line_197'>      the city, in any age, been exposed to the convulsions of nature,</a>
<a id='line_198'>      which, in the climate of Antioch, Lisbon, or Lima, have crumbled</a>
<a id='line_199'>      in a few moments the works of ages into dust. Fire is the most</a>
<a id='line_200'>      powerful agent of life and death: the rapid mischief may be</a>
<a id='line_201'>      kindled and propagated by the industry or negligence of mankind;</a>
<a id='line_202'>      and every period of the Roman annals is marked by the repetition</a>
<a id='line_203'>      of similar calamities. A memorable conflagration, the guilt or</a>
<a id='line_204'>      misfortune of Nero’s reign, continued, though with unequal fury,</a>
<a id='line_205'>      either six or nine days. 11 Innumerable buildings, crowded in</a>
<a id='line_206'>      close and crooked streets, supplied perpetual fuel for the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      flames; and when they ceased, four only of the fourteen regions</a>
<a id='line_208'>      were left entire; three were totally destroyed, and seven were</a>
<a id='line_209'>      deformed by the relics of smoking and lacerated edifices. 12 In</a>
<a id='line_210'>      the full meridian of empire, the metropolis arose with fresh</a>
<a id='line_211'>      beauty from her ashes; yet the memory of the old deplored their</a>
<a id='line_212'>      irreparable losses, the arts of Greece, the trophies of victory,</a>
<a id='line_213'>      the monuments of primitive or fabulous antiquity. In the days of</a>
<a id='line_214'>      distress and anarchy, every wound is mortal, every fall</a>
<a id='line_215'>      irretrievable; nor can the damage be restored either by the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      public care of government, or the activity of private interest.</a>
<a id='line_217'>      Yet two causes may be alleged, which render the calamity of fire</a>
<a id='line_218'>      more destructive to a flourishing than a decayed city. _1._ The</a>
<a id='line_219'>      more combustible materials of brick, timber, and metals, are</a>
<a id='line_220'>      first melted or consumed; but the flames may play without injury</a>
<a id='line_221'>      or effect on the naked walls, and massy arches, that have been</a>
<a id='line_222'>      despoiled of their ornaments. _2._ It is among the common and</a>
<a id='line_223'>      plebeian habitations, that a mischievous spark is most easily</a>
<a id='line_224'>      blown to a conflagration; but as soon as they are devoured, the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      greater edifices, which have resisted or escaped, are left as so</a>
<a id='line_226'>      many islands in a state of solitude and safety. From her</a>
<a id='line_227'>      situation, Rome is exposed to the danger of frequent inundations.</a>
<a id='line_228'>      Without excepting the Tyber, the rivers that descend from either</a>
<a id='line_229'>      side of the Apennine have a short and irregular course; a shallow</a>
<a id='line_230'>      stream in the summer heats; an impetuous torrent, when it is</a>
<a id='line_231'>      swelled in the spring or winter, by the fall of rain, and the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      melting of the snows. When the current is repelled from the sea</a>
<a id='line_233'>      by adverse winds, when the ordinary bed is inadequate to the</a>
<a id='line_234'>      weight of waters, they rise above the banks, and overspread,</a>
<a id='line_235'>      without limits or control, the plains and cities of the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_236'>      country. Soon after the triumph of the first Punic war, the Tyber</a>
<a id='line_237'>      was increased by unusual rains; and the inundation, surpassing</a>
<a id='line_238'>      all former measure of time and place, destroyed all the buildings</a>
<a id='line_239'>      that were situated below the hills of Rome. According to the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      variety of ground, the same mischief was produced by different</a>
<a id='line_241'>      means; and the edifices were either swept away by the sudden</a>
<a id='line_242'>      impulse, or dissolved and undermined by the long continuance, of</a>
<a id='line_243'>      the flood. 13 Under the reign of Augustus, the same calamity was</a>
<a id='line_244'>      renewed: the lawless river overturned the palaces and temples on</a>
<a id='line_245'>      its banks; 14 and, after the labors of the emperor in cleansing</a>
<a id='line_246'>      and widening the bed that was encumbered with ruins, 15 the</a>
<a id='line_247'>      vigilance of his successors was exercised by similar dangers and</a>

<a id='line_349'>      by a hostile principle, and how far they possessed the means and</a>
<a id='line_350'>      the leisure to satiate their enmity. In the preceding volumes of</a>

<a id='line_352'>      religion; and I can only resume, in a few words, their real or</a>
<a id='line_353'>      imaginary connection with the ruin of ancient Rome. Our fancy may</a>
<a id='line_354'>      create, or adopt, a pleasing romance, that the Goths and Vandals</a>
<a id='line_355'>      sallied from Scandinavia, ardent to avenge the flight of Odin; 20</a>
<a id='line_356'>      to break the chains, and to chastise the oppressors, of mankind;</a>
<a id='line_357'>      that they wished to burn the records of classic literature, and</a>
<a id='line_358'>      to found their national architecture on the broken members of the</a>
<a id='line_359'>      Tuscan and Corinthian orders. But in simple truth, the northern</a>
<a id='line_360'>      conquerors were neither sufficiently savage, nor sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_361'>      refined, to entertain such aspiring ideas of destruction and</a>
<a id='line_362'>      revenge. The shepherds of Scythia and Germany had been educated</a>
<a id='line_363'>      in the armies of the empire, whose discipline they acquired, and</a>
<a id='line_364'>      whose weakness they invaded: with the familiar use of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_365'>      tongue, they had learned to reverence the name and titles of</a>
<a id='line_366'>      Rome; and, though incapable of emulating, they were more inclined</a>
<a id='line_367'>      to admire, than to abolish, the arts and studies of a brighter</a>
<a id='line_368'>      period. In the transient possession of a rich and unresisting</a>
<a id='line_369'>      capital, the soldiers of Alaric and Genseric were stimulated by</a>
<a id='line_370'>      the passions of a victorious army; amidst the wanton indulgence</a>
<a id='line_371'>      of lust or cruelty, portable wealth was the object of their</a>
<a id='line_372'>      search; nor could they derive either pride or pleasure from the</a>
<a id='line_373'>      unprofitable reflection, that they had battered to the ground the</a>
<a id='line_374'>      works of the consuls and Cæsars. Their moments were indeed</a>
<a id='line_375'>      precious; the Goths evacuated Rome on the sixth, 21 the Vandals</a>
<a id='line_376'>      on the fifteenth, day: 22 and, though it be far more difficult to</a>
<a id='line_377'>      build than to destroy, their hasty assault would have made a</a>
<a id='line_378'>      slight impression on the solid piles of antiquity. We may</a>
<a id='line_379'>      remember, that both Alaric and Genseric affected to spare the</a>
<a id='line_380'>      buildings of the city; that they subsisted in strength and beauty</a>
<a id='line_381'>      under the auspicious government of Theodoric; 23 and that the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      momentary resentment of Totila 24 was disarmed by his own temper</a>
<a id='line_383'>      and the advice of his friends and enemies. From these innocent</a>
<a id='line_384'>      Barbarians, the reproach may be transferred to the Catholics of</a>
<a id='line_385'>      Rome. The statues, altars, and houses, of the dæmons, were an</a>
<a id='line_386'>      abomination in their eyes; and in the absolute command of the</a>
<a id='line_387'>      city, they might labor with zeal and perseverance to erase the</a>
<a id='line_388'>      idolatry of their ancestors. The demolition of the temples in the</a>
<a id='line_389'>      East 25 affords to _them_ an example of conduct, and to _us_ an</a>
<a id='line_390'>      argument of belief; and it is probable that a portion of guilt or</a>
<a id='line_391'>      merit may be imputed with justice to the Roman proselytes. Yet</a>
<a id='line_392'>      their abhorrence was confined to the monuments of heathen</a>
<a id='line_393'>      superstition; and the civil structures that were dedicated to the</a>
<a id='line_394'>      business or pleasure of society might be preserved without injury</a>
<a id='line_395'>      or scandal. The change of religion was accomplished, not by a</a>

<a id='line_397'>      senate, and of time. Of the Christian hierarchy, the bishops of</a>

<a id='line_441'>      its local situation, and the temporary circumstances of the</a>
<a id='line_442'>      world. The Barbarian conquerors of Rome usurped in a moment the</a>
<a id='line_443'>      toil and treasure of successive ages; but, except the luxuries of</a>
<a id='line_444'>      immediate consumption, they must view without desire all that</a>
<a id='line_445'>      could not be removed from the city in the Gothic wagons or the</a>
<a id='line_446'>      fleet of the Vandals. 27 Gold and silver were the first objects</a>

<a id='line_448'>      compass, they represent the most ample command of the industry</a>
<a id='line_449'>      and possessions of mankind. A vase or a statue of those precious</a>
<a id='line_450'>      metals might tempt the vanity of some Barbarian chief; but the</a>
<a id='line_451'>      grosser multitude, regardless of the form, was tenacious only of</a>
<a id='line_452'>      the substance; and the melted ingots might be readily divided and</a>
<a id='line_453'>      stamped into the current coin of the empire. The less active or</a>
<a id='line_454'>      less fortunate robbers were reduced to the baser plunder of</a>
<a id='line_455'>      brass, lead, iron, and copper: whatever had escaped the Goths and</a>
<a id='line_456'>      Vandals was pillaged by the Greek tyrants; and the emperor</a>
<a id='line_457'>      Constans, in his rapacious visit, stripped the bronze tiles from</a>
<a id='line_458'>      the roof of the Pantheon. 28 The edifices of Rome might be</a>
<a id='line_459'>      considered as a vast and various mine; the first labor of</a>
<a id='line_460'>      extracting the materials was already performed; the metals were</a>
<a id='line_461'>      purified and cast; the marbles were hewn and polished; and after</a>
<a id='line_462'>      foreign and domestic rapine had been satiated, the remains of the</a>
<a id='line_463'>      city, could a purchaser have been found, were still venal. The</a>
<a id='line_464'>      monuments of antiquity had been left naked of their precious</a>
<a id='line_465'>      ornaments; but the Romans would demolish with their own hands the</a>
<a id='line_466'>      arches and walls, if the hope of profit could surpass the cost of</a>
<a id='line_467'>      the labor and exportation. If Charlemagne had fixed in Italy the</a>
<a id='line_468'>      seat of the Western empire, his genius would have aspired to</a>
<a id='line_469'>      restore, rather than to violate, the works of the Cæsars; but</a>
<a id='line_470'>      policy confined the French monarch to the forests of Germany; his</a>
<a id='line_471'>      taste could be gratified only by destruction; and the new palace</a>
<a id='line_472'>      of Aix la Chapelle was decorated with the marbles of Ravenna 29</a>
<a id='line_473'>      and Rome. 30 Five hundred years after Charlemagne, a king of</a>
<a id='line_474'>      Sicily, Robert, the wisest and most liberal sovereign of the age,</a>
<a id='line_475'>      was supplied with the same materials by the easy navigation of</a>
<a id='line_476'>      the Tyber and the sea; and Petrarch sighs an indignant complaint,</a>
<a id='line_477'>      that the ancient capital of the world should adorn from her own</a>
<a id='line_478'>      bowels the slothful luxury of Naples. 31 But these examples of</a>
<a id='line_479'>      plunder or purchase were rare in the darker ages; and the Romans,</a>
<a id='line_480'>      alone and unenvied, might have applied to their private or public</a>
<a id='line_481'>      use the remaining structures of antiquity, if in their present</a>
<a id='line_482'>      form and situation they had not been useless in a great measure</a>
<a id='line_483'>      to the city and its inhabitants. The walls still described the</a>
<a id='line_484'>      old circumference, but the city had descended from the seven</a>
<a id='line_485'>      hills into the Campus Martius; and some of the noblest monuments</a>
<a id='line_486'>      which had braved the injuries of time were left in a desert, far</a>
<a id='line_487'>      remote from the habitations of mankind. The palaces of the</a>
<a id='line_488'>      senators were no longer adapted to the manners or fortunes of</a>
<a id='line_489'>      their indigent successors: the use of baths 32 and porticos was</a>
<a id='line_490'>      forgotten: in the sixth century, the games of the theatre,</a>
<a id='line_491'>      amphitheatre, and circus, had been interrupted: some temples were</a>
<a id='line_492'>      devoted to the prevailing worship; but the Christian churches</a>
<a id='line_493'>      preferred the holy figure of the cross; and fashion, or reason,</a>
<a id='line_494'>      had distributed after a peculiar model the cells and offices of</a>
<a id='line_495'>      the cloister. Under the ecclesiastical reign, the number of these</a>
<a id='line_496'>      pious foundations was enormously multiplied; and the city was</a>
<a id='line_497'>      crowded with forty monasteries of men, twenty of women, and sixty</a>
<a id='line_498'>      chapters and colleges of canons and priests, 33 who aggravated,</a>

<a id='line_633'>      frequent, seditions: it is from the decline of the latter, from</a>
<a id='line_634'>      the beginning of the tenth century, that we may date the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      licentiousness of private war, which violated with impunity the</a>
<a id='line_636'>      laws of the Code and the Gospel, without respecting the majesty</a>
<a id='line_637'>      of the absent sovereign, or the presence and person of the vicar</a>
<a id='line_638'>      of Christ. In a dark period of five hundred years, Rome was</a>
<a id='line_639'>      perpetually afflicted by the sanguinary quarrels of the nobles</a>
<a id='line_640'>      and the people, the Guelphs and Ghibelines, the Colonna and</a>
<a id='line_641'>      Ursini; and if much has escaped the knowledge, and much is</a>
<a id='line_642'>      unworthy of the notice, of history, I have exposed in the two</a>
<a id='line_643'>      preceding chapters the causes and effects of the public</a>
<a id='line_644'>      disorders. At such a time, when every quarrel was decided by the</a>
<a id='line_645'>      sword, and none could trust their lives or properties to the</a>
<a id='line_646'>      impotence of law, the powerful citizens were armed for safety, or</a>
<a id='line_647'>      offence, against the domestic enemies whom they feared or hated.</a>
<a id='line_648'>      Except Venice alone, the same dangers and designs were common to</a>
<a id='line_649'>      all the free republics of Italy; and the nobles usurped the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      prerogative of fortifying their houses, and erecting strong</a>
<a id='line_651'>      towers, 39 that were capable of resisting a sudden attack. The</a>
<a id='line_652'>      cities were filled with these hostile edifices; and the example</a>
<a id='line_653'>      of Lucca, which contained three hundred towers; her law, which</a>
<a id='line_654'>      confined their height to the measure of fourscore feet, may be</a>
<a id='line_655'>      extended with suitable latitude to the more opulent and populous</a>
<a id='line_656'>      states. The first step of the senator Brancaleone in the</a>
<a id='line_657'>      establishment of peace and justice, was to demolish (as we have</a>
<a id='line_658'>      already seen) one hundred and forty of the towers of Rome; and,</a>
<a id='line_659'>      in the last days of anarchy and discord, as late as the reign of</a>
<a id='line_660'>      Martin the Fifth, forty-four still stood in one of the thirteen</a>
<a id='line_661'>      or fourteen regions of the city. To this mischievous purpose the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      remains of antiquity were most readily adapted: the temples and</a>
<a id='line_663'>      arches afforded a broad and solid basis for the new structures of</a>
<a id='line_664'>      brick and stone; and we can name the modern turrets that were</a>
<a id='line_665'>      raised on the triumphal monuments of Julius Cæsar, Titus, and the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      Antonines. 40 With some slight alterations, a theatre, an</a>
<a id='line_667'>      amphitheatre, a mausoleum, was transformed into a strong and</a>
<a id='line_668'>      spacious citadel. I need not repeat, that the mole of Adrian has</a>
<a id='line_669'>      assumed the title and form of the castle of St. Angelo; 41 the</a>
<a id='line_670'>      Septizonium of Severus was capable of standing against a royal</a>
<a id='line_671'>      army; 42 the sepulchre of Metella has sunk under its outworks; 43</a>
<a id='line_672'>      431 the theatres of Pompey and Marcellus were occupied by the</a>
<a id='line_673'>      Savelli and Ursini families; 44 and the rough fortress has been</a>
<a id='line_674'>      gradually softened to the splendor and elegance of an Italian</a>
<a id='line_675'>      palace. Even the churches were encompassed with arms and</a>
<a id='line_676'>      bulwarks, and the military engines on the roof of St. Peter’s</a>
<a id='line_677'>      were the terror of the Vatican and the scandal of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_678'>      world. Whatever is fortified will be attacked; and whatever is</a>
<a id='line_679'>      attacked may be destroyed. Could the Romans have wrested from the</a>
<a id='line_680'>      popes the castle of St. Angelo, they had resolved by a public</a>
<a id='line_681'>      decree to annihilate that monument of servitude. Every building</a>
<a id='line_682'>      of defence was exposed to a siege; and in every siege the arts</a>
<a id='line_683'>      and engines of destruction were laboriously employed. After the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      death of Nicholas the Fourth, Rome, without a sovereign or a</a>
<a id='line_685'>      senate, was abandoned six months to the fury of civil war. “The</a>
<a id='line_686'>      houses,” says a cardinal and poet of the times, 45 “were crushed</a>
<a id='line_687'>      by the weight and velocity of enormous stones; 46 the walls were</a>
<a id='line_688'>      perforated by the strokes of the battering-ram; the towers were</a>
<a id='line_689'>      involved in fire and smoke; and the assailants were stimulated by</a>
<a id='line_690'>      rapine and revenge.” The work was consummated by the tyranny of</a>
<a id='line_691'>      the laws; and the factions of Italy alternately exercised a blind</a>
<a id='line_692'>      and thoughtless vengeance on their adversaries, whose houses and</a>
<a id='line_693'>      castles they razed to the ground. 47 In comparing the _days_ of</a>
<a id='line_694'>      foreign, with the _ages_ of domestic, hostility, we must</a>
<a id='line_695'>      pronounce, that the latter have been far more ruinous to the</a>
<a id='line_696'>      city; and our opinion is confirmed by the evidence of Petrarch.</a>
<a id='line_697'>      “Behold,” says the laureate, “the relics of Rome, the image of</a>
<a id='line_698'>      her pristine greatness! neither time nor the Barbarian can boast</a>

<a id='line_704'>      in some degree be multiplied by each other; since the houses and</a>
<a id='line_705'>      towers, which were subverted by civil war, required by a new and</a>

<a id='line_908'>      “I live disconsolate,” a weeping widower: “I burn under the</a>

<a id='line_918'>      spectators, “you fall with me;”—intimating (says the contemporary</a>

<a id='line_1232'>      The measurement of the space and intervals of the ruins. 2. The</a>

<a id='line_1241'>      Of these pilgrims, and of every reader, the attention will be</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      excited by a History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire;</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      the greatest, perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      mankind. The various causes and progressive effects are connected</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      with many of the events most interesting in human annals: the</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      artful policy of the Cæsars, who long maintained the name and</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      image of a free republic; the disorders of military despotism;</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      the rise, establishment, and sects of Christianity; the</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      foundation of Constantinople; the division of the monarchy; the</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      invasion and settlements of the Barbarians of Germany and</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      Scythia; the institutions of the civil law; the character and</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      religion of Mahomet; the temporal sovereignty of the popes; the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      restoration and decay of the Western empire of Charlemagne; the</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      crusades of the Latins in the East: the conquests of the Saracens</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      and Turks; the ruin of the Greek empire; the state and</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      revolutions of Rome in the middle age. The historian may applaud</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      the importance and variety of his subject; but while he is</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      conscious of his own imperfections, he must often accuse the</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      deficiency of his materials. It was among the ruins of the</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      Capitol that I first conceived the idea of a work which has</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      amused and exercised near twenty years of my life, and which,</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      however inadequate to my own wishes, I finally delivere to the</a>

<a id='line_1533'>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of</a>
<a id='line_1534'>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It</a>

<a id='line_1537'></a>
<a id='line_1538'>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</a>
