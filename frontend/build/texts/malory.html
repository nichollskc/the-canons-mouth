<a id='line_763'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</a>
<a id='line_764'></a>
<a id='line_765'></a>
<a id='line_766'>The Morte D’Arthur was finished, as the epilogue tells us, in the ninth</a>
<a id='line_767'>year of Edward IV., i.e. between March 4, 1469 and the same date in</a>
<a id='line_768'>1470. It is thus, fitly enough, the last important English book written</a>
<a id='line_769'>before the introduction of printing into this country, and since no</a>
<a id='line_770'>manuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first English</a>
<a id='line_771'>classic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a</a>
<a id='line_772'>printed text. Caxton’s story of how the book was brought to him and he</a>
<a id='line_773'>was induced to print it may be read farther on in his own preface. From</a>
<a id='line_774'>this we learn also that he was not only the printer of the book, but to</a>
<a id='line_775'>some extent its editor also, dividing Malory’s work into twenty-one</a>
<a id='line_776'>books, splitting up the books into chapters, by no means skilfully, and</a>
<a id='line_777'>supplying the “Rubrish” or chapter-headings. It may be added that</a>
<a id='line_778'>Caxton’s preface contains, moreover, a brief criticism which, on the</a>
<a id='line_779'>points on which it touches, is still the soundest and most sympathetic</a>
<a id='line_780'>that has been written.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>Caxton finished his edition the last day of July 1485, some fifteen or</a>
<a id='line_783'>sixteen years after Malory wrote his epilogue. It is clear that the</a>
<a id='line_784'>author was then dead, or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy</a>
<a id='line_785'>editor to the book, and recent discoveries (if bibliography may, for</a>
<a id='line_786'>the moment, enlarge its bounds to mention such matters) have revealed</a>
<a id='line_787'>with tolerable certainty when Malory died and who he was. In letters to</a>
<a id='line_788'>The Athenaeum in July 1896 Mr. T. Williams pointed out that the name of</a>
<a id='line_789'>a Sir Thomas Malorie occurred among those of a number of other</a>
<a id='line_790'>Lancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by Edward IV. in</a>
<a id='line_791'>1468, and that a William Mallerye was mentioned in the same year as</a>
<a id='line_792'>taking part in a Lancastrian rising. In September 1897, again, in</a>
<a id='line_793'>another letter to the same paper, Mr. A. T. Martin reported the finding</a>
<a id='line_794'>of the will of a Thomas Malory of Papworth, a hundred partly in</a>
<a id='line_795'>Cambridgeshire, partly in Hunts. This will was made on September 16,</a>
<a id='line_796'>1469, and as it was proved the 27th of the next month the testator must</a>
<a id='line_797'>have been in immediate expectation of death. It contains the most</a>
<a id='line_798'>careful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of</a>
<a id='line_799'>three daughters and seven sons, of whom the youngest seems to have been</a>
<a id='line_800'>still an infant. We cannot say with certainty that this Thomas Malory,</a>
<a id='line_801'>whose last thoughts were so busy for his children, was our author, or</a>
<a id='line_802'>that the Lancastrian knight discovered by Mr. Williams was identical</a>
<a id='line_803'>with either or both, but such evidence as the Morte D’Arthur offers</a>
<a id='line_804'>favours such a belief. There is not only the epilogue with its</a>
<a id='line_805'>petition, “pray for me while I am alive that God send me good</a>
<a id='line_806'>deliverance and when I am dead pray you all for my soul,” but this very</a>
<a id='line_807'>request is foreshadowed at the end of chap. 37 of Book ix. in the</a>
<a id='line_808'>touching passage, surely inspired by personal experience, as to the</a>
<a id='line_809'>sickness “that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have”; and the</a>
<a id='line_810'>reflections on English fickleness in the first chapter of Book xxi.,</a>
<a id='line_811'>though the Wars of the Roses might have inspired them in any one, come</a>
<a id='line_812'>most naturally from an author who was a Lancastrian knight.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>If the Morte D’Arthur was really written in prison and by a prisoner</a>
<a id='line_815'>distressed by ill-health as well as by lack of liberty, surely no task</a>
<a id='line_816'>was ever better devised to while away weary hours. Leaving abundant</a>
<a id='line_817'>scope for originality in selection, modification, and arrangement, as a</a>
<a id='line_818'>compilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which</a>
<a id='line_819'>adds the touch of restfulness to literary work. No original, it is</a>
<a id='line_820'>said, has yet been found for Book vii., and it is possible that none</a>
<a id='line_821'>will ever be forthcoming for chap. 20 of Book xviii., which describes</a>
<a id='line_822'>the arrival of the body of the Fair Maiden of Astolat at Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_823'>court, or vii for chap. 25 of the same book, with its discourse on true</a>
<a id='line_824'>love; but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter</a>
<a id='line_825'>to the “Merlin” of Robert de Borron and his successors (Bks. i.-iv.),</a>
<a id='line_826'>the English metrical romance La Morte Arthur of the Thornton manuscript</a>
<a id='line_827'>(Bk. v.), the French romances of Tristan (Bks. viii.-x.) and of</a>
<a id='line_828'>Launcelot (Bks. vi., xi.-xix.), and lastly to the English prose Morte</a>
<a id='line_829'>Arthur of Harley MS. 2252 (Bks. xviii., xx., xxi.). As to Malory’s</a>
<a id='line_830'>choice of his authorities critics have not failed to point out that now</a>
<a id='line_831'>and again he gives a worse version where a better has come down to us,</a>
<a id='line_832'>and if he had been able to order a complete set of Arthurian</a>
<a id='line_833'>manuscripts from his bookseller, no doubt he would have done even</a>
<a id='line_834'>better than he did! But of the skill, approaching to original genius,</a>
<a id='line_835'>with which he used the books from which he worked there is little</a>
<a id='line_836'>dispute.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>Malory died leaving his work obviously unrevised, and in this condition</a>
<a id='line_839'>it was brought to Caxton, who prepared it for the press with his usual</a>
<a id='line_840'>enthusiasm in the cause of good literature, and also, it must be added,</a>
<a id='line_841'>with his usual carelessness. New chapters are sometimes made to begin</a>
<a id='line_842'>in the middle of a sentence, and in addition to simple misprints there</a>
<a id='line_843'>are numerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have</a>
<a id='line_844'>the text as Malory intended it to stand. After Caxton’s edition</a>
<a id='line_845'>Malory’s manuscript must have disappeared, and subsequent editions are</a>
<a id='line_846'>differentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow</a>
<a id='line_847'>the first. Editions appeared printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 and</a>
<a id='line_848'>1529, by William Copland in 1559, by Thomas East about 1585, and by</a>
<a id='line_849'>Thomas Stansby in 1634, each printer apparently taking the text of his</a>
<a id='line_850'>immediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications. Stansby’s</a>
<a id='line_851'>edition served for reprints in 1816 and 1856 (the latter edited by</a>
<a id='line_852'>Thomas Wright); but in 1817 an edition supervised by Robert Southey</a>
<a id='line_853'>went back to Caxton’s text, though to a copy (only two are extant, and</a>
<a id='line_854'>only one perfect!) in which eleven leaves were supplied from Wynkyn de</a>
<a id='line_855'>Worde’s reprint. In 1868 Sir Edward Strachey produced for the present</a>
<a id='line_856'>publishers a reprint of Southey’s text in modern spelling, with the</a>
<a id='line_857'>substitution of current words for those now obsolete, and the softening</a>
<a id='line_858'>of a handful of passages likely, he thought, to prevent the book being</a>
<a id='line_859'>placed in the hands of boys. In 1889 a boon was conferred on scholars</a>
<a id='line_860'>by the publication of Dr. H. Oskar Sommer’s page-for-page reprint of</a>
<a id='line_861'>Caxton’s text, with an elaborate discussion of Malory’s sources. Dr.</a>
<a id='line_862'>Sommer’s edition was used by Sir E. Strachey to revise his Globe text,</a>
<a id='line_863'>and in 1897 Mr. Israel Gollancz produced for the “Temple Classics” a</a>
<a id='line_864'>very pretty edition in which Sir Edward Strachey’s principles of</a>
<a id='line_865'>modernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted, but with the</a>
<a id='line_866'>restoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases. As to the present</a>
<a id='line_867'>edition, Sir Edward Strachey altered with so sparing a hand that on</a>
<a id='line_868'>many pages differences between his version and that here printed will</a>
<a id='line_869'>be looked for in vain; but the most anxious care has been taken to</a>
<a id='line_870'>produce a text modernised as to its spelling, but in other respects in</a>
<a id='line_871'>accurate accordance with Caxton’s text, as represented by Dr Sommer’s</a>
<a id='line_872'>reprint. Obvious misprints have been silently corrected, but in a few</a>
<a id='line_873'>cases notes show where emendations have been introduced from Wynkyn de</a>
<a id='line_874'>Worde—not that Wynkyn had any more right to emend Caxton than we, but</a>
<a id='line_875'>because even a printer’s conjecture gains a little sanctity after four</a>
<a id='line_876'>centuries. The restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much</a>
<a id='line_877'>fuller glossary, and the index of names has therefore been separated</a>
<a id='line_878'>from it and enlarged. In its present form the index is the work of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_879'>Henry Littlehales.</a>

<a id='line_885'>PREFACE OF WILLIAM CAXTON</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>After that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well of</a>
<a id='line_888'>contemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great</a>
<a id='line_889'>conquerors and princes, and also certain books of ensamples and</a>
<a id='line_890'>doctrine, many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England came</a>
<a id='line_891'>and demanded me many and oft times, wherefore that I have not do made</a>
<a id='line_892'>and imprint the noble history of the Saint Greal, and of the most</a>
<a id='line_893'>renowned Christian king, first and chief of the three best Christian,</a>
<a id='line_894'>and worthy, King Arthur, which ought most to be remembered among us</a>
<a id='line_895'>Englishmen to-fore all other Christian kings; for it is notoyrly known</a>
<a id='line_896'>through the universal world, that there be nine worthy and the best</a>
<a id='line_897'>that ever were, that is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews, and three</a>
<a id='line_898'>Christian men. As for the Paynims, they were to-fore the Incarnation of</a>
<a id='line_899'>Christ, which were named, the first Hector of Troy, of whom the history</a>
<a id='line_900'>is comen both in ballad and in prose, the second Alexander the Great,</a>
<a id='line_901'>and the third Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, of whom the histories be</a>
<a id='line_902'>well known and had. And as for the three Jews, which also were to-fore</a>
<a id='line_903'>the incarnation of our Lord, of whom the first was duke Joshua which</a>
<a id='line_904'>brought the children of Israel into the land of behest, the second</a>
<a id='line_905'>David king of Jerusalem, and the third Judas Machabeus, of these three</a>
<a id='line_906'>the Bible rehearseth all their noble histories and acts. And since the</a>
<a id='line_907'>said Incarnation have been three noble Christian men, stalled and</a>
<a id='line_908'>admitted through the universal world into the number of the nine best</a>
<a id='line_909'>and worthy. Of whom was first the noble Arthur, whose noble acts I</a>
<a id='line_910'>purpose to write in this present book here following. The second was</a>
<a id='line_911'>Charlemain, or Charles the Great, of whom the history is had in many</a>
<a id='line_912'>places, both in French and in English. And the third and last was</a>
<a id='line_913'>Godfrey of Boloine, of whose acts and life I made a book unto the</a>
<a id='line_914'>excellent prince and king of noble memory, King Edward the Fourth.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history</a>
<a id='line_917'>of the said noble king and conqueror King Arthur, and of his knights,</a>
<a id='line_918'>with the history of the Saint Greal, and of the death and ending of the</a>
<a id='line_919'>said Arthur; affirming that I ought rather to imprint his acts and</a>
<a id='line_920'>noble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of the other eight,</a>
<a id='line_921'>considering that he was a man born within this realm, and king and</a>
<a id='line_922'>emperor of the same: and that there be in French divers and many noble</a>
<a id='line_923'>volumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I answered that</a>
<a id='line_924'>divers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that all</a>
<a id='line_925'>such books as been made of him be feigned and fables, because that some</a>
<a id='line_926'>chronicles make of him no mention, nor remember him nothing, nor of his</a>
<a id='line_927'>knights. Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him</a>
<a id='line_928'>that should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur</a>
<a id='line_929'>might well be aretted great folly and blindness. For he said that there</a>
<a id='line_930'>were many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see his sepulchre in</a>
<a id='line_931'>the monastery of Glastonbury. And also in Policronicon, in the fifth</a>
<a id='line_932'>book the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third</a>
<a id='line_933'>chapter, where his body was buried, and after found, and translated</a>
<a id='line_934'>into the said monastery. Ye shall see also in the history of Bochas, in</a>
<a id='line_935'>his book De Casu Principum, part of his noble acts, and also of his</a>
<a id='line_936'>fall. Also Galfridus in his British book recounteth his life: and in</a>
<a id='line_937'>divers places of England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall</a>
<a id='line_938'>remain perpetually, and also of his knights. First in the abbey of</a>
<a id='line_939'>Westminster, at St. Edward’s shrine, remaineth the print of his seal in</a>
<a id='line_940'>red wax closed in beryl, in which is written, Patricius Arthurus</a>
<a id='line_941'>Britannie, Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator. Item in the castle of</a>
<a id='line_942'>Dover ye may see Gawaine’s skull, and Cradok’s mantle: at Winchester</a>
<a id='line_943'>the Round Table: in other places Launcelot’s sword and many other</a>
<a id='line_944'>things. Then all these things considered, there can no man reasonably</a>
<a id='line_945'>gainsay but there was a king of this land named Arthur. For in all</a>
<a id='line_946'>places, Christian and heathen, he is reputed and taken for one of the</a>
<a id='line_947'>nine worthy, and the first of the three Christian men. And also, he is</a>
<a id='line_948'>more spoken of beyond the sea, more books made of his noble acts, than</a>
<a id='line_949'>there be in England, as well in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish,</a>
<a id='line_950'>as in French. And yet of record remain in witness of him in Wales, in</a>
<a id='line_951'>the town of Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous works of iron</a>
<a id='line_952'>lying under the ground, and royal vaults, which divers now living have</a>
<a id='line_953'>seen. Wherefore it is a marvel why he is no more renowned in his own</a>
<a id='line_954'>country, save only it accordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no</a>
<a id='line_955'>man is accepted for a prophet in his own country.</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>Then all these things aforesaid alleged, I could not well deny but that</a>
<a id='line_958'>there was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine</a>
<a id='line_959'>worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men. And many noble</a>
<a id='line_960'>volumes be made of him and of his noble knights in French, which I have</a>
<a id='line_961'>seen and read beyond the sea, which be not had in our maternal tongue.</a>
<a id='line_962'>But in Welsh be many and also in French, and some in English but</a>
<a id='line_963'>nowhere nigh all. Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly</a>
<a id='line_964'>into English I have after the simple conning that God hath sent to me,</a>
<a id='line_965'>under the favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen,</a>
<a id='line_966'>enprised to imprint a book of the noble histories of the said King</a>
<a id='line_967'>Arthur, and of certain of his knights, after a copy unto me delivered,</a>
<a id='line_968'>which copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of French,</a>
<a id='line_969'>and reduced it into English. And I, according to my copy, have done set</a>
<a id='line_970'>it in imprint, to the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble</a>
<a id='line_971'>acts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used</a>
<a id='line_972'>in those days, by which they came to honour, and how they that were</a>
<a id='line_973'>vicious were punished and oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly</a>
<a id='line_974'>beseeching all noble lords and ladies, with all other estates of what</a>
<a id='line_975'>estate or degree they been of, that shall see and read in this said</a>
<a id='line_976'>book and work, that they take the good and honest acts in their</a>
<a id='line_977'>remembrance, and to follow the same. Wherein they shall find many</a>
<a id='line_978'>joyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity,</a>
<a id='line_979'>gentleness, and chivalry. For herein may be seen noble chivalry,</a>
<a id='line_980'>courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship,</a>
<a id='line_981'>cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the good and leave</a>
<a id='line_982'>the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown. And for to</a>
<a id='line_983'>pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in, but for to give</a>
<a id='line_984'>faith and belief that all is true that is contained herein, ye be at</a>
<a id='line_985'>your liberty: but all is written for our doctrine, and for to beware</a>
<a id='line_986'>that we fall not to vice nor sin, but to exercise and follow virtue, by</a>
<a id='line_987'>which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life, and</a>
<a id='line_988'>after this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss in</a>
<a id='line_989'>heaven; the which He grant us that reigneth in heaven, the blessed</a>
<a id='line_990'>Trinity. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>Then to proceed forth in this said book, which I direct unto all noble</a>
<a id='line_993'>princes, lords and ladies, gentlemen or gentlewomen, that desire to</a>
<a id='line_994'>read or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great</a>
<a id='line_995'>conqueror and excellent king, King Arthur, sometime king of this noble</a>
<a id='line_996'>realm, then called Britain; I, William Caxton, simple person, present</a>

<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>CHAPTER I. First, How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Igraine his wife, and of their departing suddenly again.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>It befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all</a>
<a id='line_1048'>England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that</a>
<a id='line_1049'>held war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of</a>
<a id='line_1050'>Tintagil. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him</a>
<a id='line_1051'>to bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a</a>
<a id='line_1052'>passing wise, and her name was called Igraine.</a>
<a id='line_1053'></a>
<a id='line_1054'>So when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of</a>
<a id='line_1055'>great lords they were accorded both. The king liked and loved this lady</a>
<a id='line_1056'>well, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have</a>
<a id='line_1057'>lain by her. But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent</a>
<a id='line_1058'>unto the king. And then she told the duke her husband, and said, I</a>
<a id='line_1059'>suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>husband, I counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may</a>
<a id='line_1061'>ride all night unto our own castle. And in like wise as she said so</a>
<a id='line_1062'>they departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware</a>
<a id='line_1063'>of their departing. All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing</a>
<a id='line_1064'>so suddenly, he was wonderly wroth. Then he called to him his privy</a>
<a id='line_1065'>council, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his</a>
<a id='line_1066'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>Then they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great</a>
<a id='line_1069'>charge; and if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your</a>
<a id='line_1070'>best, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him. So that was done,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>and the messengers had their answers; and that was this shortly, that</a>
<a id='line_1072'>neither he nor his wife would not come at him.</a>
<a id='line_1073'></a>
<a id='line_1074'>Then was the king wonderly wroth. And then the king sent him plain word</a>
<a id='line_1075'>again, and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish him, for within</a>
<a id='line_1076'>forty days he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he hath.</a>
<a id='line_1077'></a>
<a id='line_1078'>When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and</a>
<a id='line_1079'>garnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight</a>
<a id='line_1080'>Tintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine</a>
<a id='line_1081'>he put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he put in the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1082'>Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out. Then in all haste</a>
<a id='line_1083'>came Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1084'>Terrabil. And there he pight many pavilions, and there was great war</a>
<a id='line_1085'>made on both parties, and much people slain. Then for pure anger and</a>
<a id='line_1086'>for great love of fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick. So came to the</a>
<a id='line_1087'>king Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he was</a>
<a id='line_1088'>sick. I shall tell thee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for</a>
<a id='line_1089'>love of fair Igraine, that I may not be whole. Well, my lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1090'>Ulfius, I shall seek Merlin, and he shall do you remedy, that your</a>
<a id='line_1091'>heart shall be pleased. So Ulfius departed, and by adventure he met</a>
<a id='line_1092'>Merlin in a beggar’s array, and there Merlin asked Ulfius whom he</a>
<a id='line_1093'>sought. And he said he had little ado to tell him. Well, said Merlin, I</a>
<a id='line_1094'>know whom thou seekest, for thou seekest Merlin; therefore seek no</a>
<a id='line_1095'>farther, for I am he; and if King Uther will well reward me, and be</a>
<a id='line_1096'>sworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be his honour and profit</a>
<a id='line_1097'>more than mine; for I shall cause him to have all his desire. All this</a>
<a id='line_1098'>will I undertake, said Ulfius, that there shall be nothing reasonable</a>
<a id='line_1099'>but thou shalt have thy desire. Well, said Merlin, he shall have his</a>
<a id='line_1100'>intent and desire. And therefore, said Merlin, ride on your way, for I</a>
<a id='line_1101'>will not be long behind.</a>
<a id='line_1102'></a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>CHAPTER II. How Uther Pendragon made war on the duke of Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_1106'>how by the mean of Merlin he lay by the duchess and gat Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>Then Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he came to</a>
<a id='line_1109'>King Uther Pendragon, and told him he had met with Merlin. Where is he?</a>
<a id='line_1110'>said the king. Sir, said Ulfius, he will not dwell long. Therewithal</a>
<a id='line_1111'>Ulfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion’s door.</a>
<a id='line_1112'>And then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When King Uther saw him,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>he said he was welcome. Sir, said Merlin, I know all your heart every</a>
<a id='line_1114'>deal; so ye will be sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to</a>
<a id='line_1115'>fulfil my desire, ye shall have your desire. Then the king was sworn</a>
<a id='line_1116'>upon the Four Evangelists. Sir, said Merlin, this is my desire: the</a>
<a id='line_1117'>first night that ye shall lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>and when that is born, that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish</a>
<a id='line_1119'>there as I will have it; for it shall be your worship, and the child’s</a>
<a id='line_1120'>avail, as mickle as the child is worth. I will well, said the king, as</a>
<a id='line_1121'>thou wilt have it. Now make you ready, said Merlin, this night ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1122'>lie with Igraine in the castle of Tintagil; and ye shall be like the</a>
<a id='line_1123'>duke her husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_1124'>duke’s, and I will be like a knight that hight Sir Jordanus, a knight</a>
<a id='line_1125'>of the duke’s. But wait ye make not many questions with her nor her</a>
<a id='line_1126'>men, but say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on</a>
<a id='line_1127'>the morn till I come to you, for the castle of Tintagil is but ten</a>
<a id='line_1128'>miles hence; so this was done as they devised. But the duke of Tintagil</a>
<a id='line_1129'>espied how the king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that</a>
<a id='line_1130'>night he issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed</a>
<a id='line_1131'>the king’s host. And so, through his own issue, the duke himself was</a>
<a id='line_1132'>slain or ever the king came at the castle of Tintagil.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>So after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than</a>
<a id='line_1135'>three hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur, and on</a>
<a id='line_1136'>day came Merlin to the king, and bade him make him ready, and so he</a>
<a id='line_1137'>kissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste. But when the lady</a>
<a id='line_1138'>heard tell of the duke her husband, and by all record he was dead or</a>
<a id='line_1139'>ever King Uther came to her, then she marvelled who that might be that</a>
<a id='line_1140'>lay with her in likeness of her lord; so she mourned privily and held</a>
<a id='line_1141'>her peace. Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord</a>
<a id='line_1142'>betwixt the lady Igraine and him; the king gave them leave, for fain</a>
<a id='line_1143'>would he have been accorded with her. So the king put all the trust in</a>
<a id='line_1144'>Ulfius to entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king</a>
<a id='line_1145'>and she met together. Now will we do well, said Ulfius, our king is a</a>
<a id='line_1146'>lusty knight and wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady;</a>
<a id='line_1147'>it were great joy unto us all, an it might please the king to make her</a>
<a id='line_1148'>his queen. Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king.</a>
<a id='line_1149'>And anon, like a lusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and</a>
<a id='line_1150'>so in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and</a>
<a id='line_1151'>joy.</a>
<a id='line_1152'></a>
<a id='line_1153'>And King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was</a>
<a id='line_1154'>Gawaine’s mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.</a>
<a id='line_1155'>All this was done at the request of King Uther. And the third sister</a>
<a id='line_1156'>Morgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she learned so</a>
<a id='line_1157'>much that she was a great clerk of necromancy. And after she was wedded</a>
<a id='line_1158'>to King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Ewain’s le</a>
<a id='line_1159'>Blanchemain’s father.</a>

<a id='line_1163'>CHAPTER III. Of the birth of King Arthur and of his nurture.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>Then Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell after</a>
<a id='line_1166'>within half a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her, by</a>
<a id='line_1167'>the faith she owed to him, whose was the body; then she sore abashed to</a>
<a id='line_1168'>give answer. Dismay you not, said the king, but tell me the truth, and</a>
<a id='line_1169'>I shall love you the better, by the faith of my body. Sir, said she, I</a>
<a id='line_1170'>shall tell you the truth. The same night that my lord was dead, the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>hour of his death, as his knights record, there came into my castle of</a>
<a id='line_1172'>Tintagil a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two</a>
<a id='line_1173'>knights with him in likeness of his two knights Brastias and Jordanus,</a>
<a id='line_1174'>and so I went unto bed with him as I ought to do with my lord, and the</a>
<a id='line_1175'>same night, as I shall answer unto God, this child was begotten upon</a>
<a id='line_1176'>me. That is truth, said the king, as ye say; for it was I myself that</a>
<a id='line_1177'>came in the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father of</a>
<a id='line_1178'>the child; and there he told her all the cause, how it was by Merlin’s</a>
<a id='line_1179'>counsel. Then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the father</a>
<a id='line_1180'>of her child.</a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>Soon came Merlin unto the king, and said, Sir, ye must purvey you for</a>
<a id='line_1183'>the nourishing of your child. As thou wilt, said the king, be it. Well,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>said Merlin, I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a passing</a>
<a id='line_1185'>true man and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of your</a>
<a id='line_1186'>child, and his name is Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair livelihood</a>
<a id='line_1187'>in many parts in England and Wales; and this lord, Sir Ector, let him</a>
<a id='line_1188'>be sent for, for to come and speak with you, and desire him yourself,</a>
<a id='line_1189'>as he loveth you, that he will put his own child to nourishing to</a>
<a id='line_1190'>another woman, and that his wife nourish yours. And when the child is</a>
<a id='line_1191'>born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened. So</a>
<a id='line_1192'>like as Merlin devised it was done. And when Sir Ector was come he made</a>
<a id='line_1193'>fiaunce to the king for to nourish the child like as the king desired;</a>
<a id='line_1194'>and there the king granted Sir Ector great rewards. Then when the lady</a>
<a id='line_1195'>was delivered, the king commanded two knights and two ladies to take</a>
<a id='line_1196'>the child, bound in a cloth of gold, and that ye deliver him to what</a>
<a id='line_1197'>poor man ye meet at the postern gate of the castle. So the child was</a>
<a id='line_1198'>delivered unto Merlin, and so he bare it forth unto Sir Ector, and made</a>
<a id='line_1199'>an holy man to christen him, and named him Arthur; and so Sir Ector’s</a>
<a id='line_1200'>wife nourished him with her own pap.</a>

<a id='line_1204'>CHAPTER IV. Of the death of King Uther Pendragon.</a>
<a id='line_1205'></a>
<a id='line_1206'>Then within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady. And in</a>
<a id='line_1207'>the meanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon</a>
<a id='line_1208'>his men, and slew many of his people. Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie</a>
<a id='line_1209'>so as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an</a>
<a id='line_1210'>horse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if</a>
<a id='line_1211'>your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory. So it was</a>
<a id='line_1212'>done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an</a>
<a id='line_1213'>horse-litter with a great host towards his enemies. And at St. Albans</a>
<a id='line_1214'>there met with the king a great host of the North. And that day Sir</a>
<a id='line_1215'>Ulfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther’s men</a>
<a id='line_1216'>overcame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant</a>
<a id='line_1217'>to flight. And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy</a>
<a id='line_1218'>of his victory. And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days</a>
<a id='line_1219'>and three nights he was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great</a>
<a id='line_1220'>sorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best. There is none other</a>
<a id='line_1221'>remedy, said Merlin, but God will have his will. But look ye all barons</a>
<a id='line_1222'>be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him to speak. So</a>
<a id='line_1223'>on the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king; then</a>
<a id='line_1224'>Merlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king</a>
<a id='line_1225'>after your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance? Then Uther</a>
<a id='line_1226'>Pendragon turned him, and said in hearing of them all, I give him God’s</a>
<a id='line_1227'>blessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, and righteously and</a>
<a id='line_1228'>worshipfully that he claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing;</a>
<a id='line_1229'>and therewith he yielded up the ghost, and then was he interred as</a>
<a id='line_1230'>longed to a king. Wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_1231'>and all the barons.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'></a>
<a id='line_1234'></a>
<a id='line_1235'>CHAPTER V. How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a</a>
<a id='line_1236'>sword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>Then stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that</a>
<a id='line_1239'>was mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been king.</a>
<a id='line_1240'>Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him</a>
<a id='line_1241'>for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of</a>
<a id='line_1242'>arms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of</a>
<a id='line_1243'>cursing; and for this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night,</a>
<a id='line_1244'>that he would of his great mercy show some miracle, as he was come to</a>
<a id='line_1245'>be king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise</a>
<a id='line_1246'>king of this realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent</a>
<a id='line_1247'>for all the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by</a>
<a id='line_1248'>Christmas even unto London. And many of them made them clean of their</a>
<a id='line_1249'>life, that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God. So in</a>
<a id='line_1250'>the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul’s or not the French</a>
<a id='line_1251'>book maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church</a>
<a id='line_1252'>for to pray. And when matins and the first mass was done, there was</a>
<a id='line_1253'>seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four</a>
<a id='line_1254'>square, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an</a>
<a id='line_1255'>anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by</a>
<a id='line_1256'>the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that</a>
<a id='line_1257'>said thus:—Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is</a>
<a id='line_1258'>rightwise king born of all England. Then the people marvelled, and told</a>
<a id='line_1259'>it to the Archbishop.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>I command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you within your church and</a>
<a id='line_1262'>pray unto God still, that no man touch the sword till the high mass be</a>
<a id='line_1263'>all done. So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the</a>
<a id='line_1264'>stone and the sword. And when they saw the scripture some assayed, such</a>
<a id='line_1265'>as would have been king. But none might stir the sword nor move it. He</a>
<a id='line_1266'>is not here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the sword, but</a>
<a id='line_1267'>doubt not God will make him known. But this is my counsel, said the</a>
<a id='line_1268'>Archbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they</a>
<a id='line_1269'>to keep this sword. So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>that every man should assay that would, for to win the sword. And upon</a>
<a id='line_1271'>New Year’s Day the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that all</a>
<a id='line_1272'>knights that would joust or tourney there might play, and all this was</a>
<a id='line_1273'>ordained for to keep the lords together and the commons, for the</a>
<a id='line_1274'>Archbishop trusted that God would make him known that should win the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>sword.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>So upon New Year’s Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto</a>
<a id='line_1278'>the field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happened that</a>
<a id='line_1279'>Sir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>jousts, and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and young Arthur that was</a>
<a id='line_1281'>his nourished brother; and Sir Kay was made knight at All Hallowmass</a>
<a id='line_1282'>afore. So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for</a>
<a id='line_1283'>he had left it at his father’s lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1284'>for to ride for his sword. I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast</a>
<a id='line_1285'>after the sword, and when he came home, the lady and all were out to</a>
<a id='line_1286'>see the jousting. Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will</a>
<a id='line_1287'>ride to the churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the</a>
<a id='line_1288'>stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day. So</a>
<a id='line_1289'>when he came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his horse</a>
<a id='line_1290'>to the stile, and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>for they were at the jousting. And so he handled the sword by the</a>
<a id='line_1292'>handles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took</a>
<a id='line_1293'>his horse and rode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_1294'>delivered him the sword. And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist</a>
<a id='line_1295'>well it was the sword of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir</a>
<a id='line_1296'>Ector, and said: Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_1297'>must be king of this land. When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned</a>
<a id='line_1298'>again and came to the church, and there they alighted all three, and</a>
<a id='line_1299'>went into the church. And anon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he</a>
<a id='line_1300'>came to that sword. Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he</a>
<a id='line_1301'>brought it to me. How gat ye this sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_1302'>I will tell you. When I came home for my brother’s sword, I found</a>
<a id='line_1303'>nobody at home to deliver me his sword; and so I thought my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_1304'>Kay should not be swordless, and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it</a>
<a id='line_1305'>out of the stone without any pain. Found ye any knights about this</a>
<a id='line_1306'>sword? said Sir Ector. Nay, said Arthur. Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1307'>I understand ye must be king of this land. Wherefore I, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>and for what cause? Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so; for there</a>
<a id='line_1309'>should never man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be</a>
<a id='line_1310'>rightwise king of this land. Now let me see whether ye can put the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>sword there as it was, and pull it out again. That is no mastery, said</a>
<a id='line_1312'>Arthur, and so he put it in the stone; wherewithal Sir Ector assayed to</a>
<a id='line_1313'>pull out the sword and failed.</a>

<a id='line_1317'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur pulled out the sword divers times.</a>
<a id='line_1318'></a>
<a id='line_1319'>Now assay, said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay. And anon he pulled at the sword</a>
<a id='line_1320'>with all his might; but it would not be. Now shall ye assay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1321'>Ector to Arthur. I will well, said Arthur, and pulled it out easily.</a>
<a id='line_1322'>And therewithal Sir Ector knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_1323'>said Arthur, my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me? Nay,</a>
<a id='line_1324'>nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so; I was never your father nor of your</a>
<a id='line_1325'>blood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were.</a>
<a id='line_1326'>And then Sir Ector told him all, how he was betaken him for to nourish</a>
<a id='line_1327'>him, and by whose commandment, and by Merlin’s deliverance.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>Then Arthur made great dole when he understood that Sir Ector was not</a>
<a id='line_1330'>his father. Sir, said Ector unto Arthur, will ye be my good and</a>
<a id='line_1331'>gracious lord when ye are king? Else were I to blame, said Arthur, for</a>
<a id='line_1332'>ye are the man in the world that I am most beholden to, and my good</a>
<a id='line_1333'>lady and mother your wife, that as well as her own hath fostered me and</a>
<a id='line_1334'>kept. And if ever it be God’s will that I be king as ye say, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1335'>desire of me what I may do, and I shall not fail you; God forbid I</a>
<a id='line_1336'>should fail you Sir, said Sir Ector, I will ask no more of you, but</a>
<a id='line_1337'>that ye will make my son, your foster brother, Sir Kay, seneschal of</a>
<a id='line_1338'>all your lands. That shall be done, said Arthur, and more, by the faith</a>
<a id='line_1339'>of my body, that never man shall have that office but he, while he and</a>
<a id='line_1340'>I live. Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop, and told him how the</a>
<a id='line_1341'>sword was achieved, and by whom; and on Twelfth-day all the barons came</a>
<a id='line_1342'>thither, and to assay to take the sword, who that would assay. But</a>
<a id='line_1343'>there afore them all, there might none take it out but Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_1344'>wherefore there were many lords wroth, and said it was great shame unto</a>
<a id='line_1345'>them all and the realm, to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood</a>
<a id='line_1346'>born. And so they fell out at that time that it was put off till</a>
<a id='line_1347'>Candlemas and then all the barons should meet there again; but always</a>
<a id='line_1348'>the ten knights were ordained to watch the sword day and night, and so</a>
<a id='line_1349'>they set a pavilion over the stone and the sword, and five always</a>
<a id='line_1350'>watched. So at Candlemas many more great lords came thither for to have</a>
<a id='line_1351'>won the sword, but there might none prevail. And right as Arthur did at</a>
<a id='line_1352'>Christmas, he did at Candlemas, and pulled out the sword easily,</a>
<a id='line_1353'>whereof the barons were sore aggrieved and put it off in delay till the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>high feast of Easter. And as Arthur sped before, so did he at Easter;</a>
<a id='line_1355'>yet there were some of the great lords had indignation that Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1356'>should be king, and put it off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_1357'></a>
<a id='line_1358'>Then the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin’s providence let purvey</a>
<a id='line_1359'>then of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther</a>
<a id='line_1360'>Pendragon loved best and most trusted in his days. And such knights</a>
<a id='line_1361'>were put about Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius,</a>
<a id='line_1362'>Sir Brastias. All these, with many other, were always about Arthur, day</a>
<a id='line_1363'>and night, till the feast of Pentecost.</a>

<a id='line_1367'>CHAPTER VII. How King Arthur was crowned, and how he made officers.</a>
<a id='line_1368'></a>
<a id='line_1369'>And at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull at the</a>
<a id='line_1370'>sword that would assay; but none might prevail but Arthur, and pulled</a>
<a id='line_1371'>it out afore all the lords and commons that were there, wherefore all</a>
<a id='line_1372'>the commons cried at once, We will have Arthur unto our king, we will</a>
<a id='line_1373'>put him no more in delay, for we all see that it is God’s will that he</a>
<a id='line_1374'>shall be our king, and who that holdeth against it, we will slay him.</a>
<a id='line_1375'>And therewithal they kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried</a>
<a id='line_1376'>Arthur mercy because they had delayed him so long, and Arthur forgave</a>
<a id='line_1377'>them, and took the sword between both his hands, and offered it upon</a>
<a id='line_1378'>the altar where the Archbishop was, and so was he made knight of the</a>
<a id='line_1379'>best man that was there. And so anon was the coronation made. And there</a>
<a id='line_1380'>was he sworn unto his lords and the commons for to be a true king, to</a>
<a id='line_1381'>stand with true justice from thenceforth the days of this life. Also</a>
<a id='line_1382'>then he made all lords that held of the crown to come in, and to do</a>
<a id='line_1383'>service as they ought to do. And many complaints were made unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_1384'>Arthur of great wrongs that were done since the death of King Uther, of</a>
<a id='line_1385'>many lands that were bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_1386'>Wherefore King Arthur made the lands to be given again unto them that</a>
<a id='line_1387'>owned them.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>When this was done, that the king had stablished all the countries</a>
<a id='line_1390'>about London, then he let make Sir Kay seneschal of England; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1391'>Baudwin of Britain was made constable; and Sir Ulfius was made</a>
<a id='line_1392'>chamberlain; and Sir Brastias was made warden to wait upon the north</a>
<a id='line_1393'>from Trent forwards, for it was that time the most party the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1394'>enemies. But within few years after Arthur won all the north, Scotland,</a>
<a id='line_1395'>and all that were under their obeissance. Also Wales, a part of it,</a>
<a id='line_1396'>held against Arthur, but he overcame them all, as he did the remnant,</a>
<a id='line_1397'>through the noble prowess of himself and his knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_1398'>Table.</a>

<a id='line_1402'>CHAPTER VIII. How King Arthur held in Wales, at a Pentecost, a great</a>
<a id='line_1403'>feast, and what kings and lords came to his feast.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>Then the king removed into Wales, and let cry a great feast that it</a>
<a id='line_1406'>should be holden at Pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city</a>
<a id='line_1407'>of Carlion. Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with</a>
<a id='line_1408'>five hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast King Uriens</a>
<a id='line_1409'>of Gore with four hundred knights with him. Also there came to that</a>
<a id='line_1410'>feast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him. Also</a>
<a id='line_1411'>there came to the feast the king of Scotland with six hundred knights</a>
<a id='line_1412'>with him, and he was but a young man. Also there came to the feast a</a>
<a id='line_1413'>king that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he and his</a>
<a id='line_1414'>men were passing well beseen at all points. Also there came the king of</a>
<a id='line_1415'>Carados with five hundred knights. And King Arthur was glad of their</a>
<a id='line_1416'>coming, for he weened that all the kings and knights had come for great</a>
<a id='line_1417'>love, and to have done him worship at his feast; wherefore the king</a>
<a id='line_1418'>made great joy, and sent the kings and knights great presents. But the</a>
<a id='line_1419'>kings would none receive, but rebuked the messengers shamefully, and</a>
<a id='line_1420'>said they had no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless boy that was</a>
<a id='line_1421'>come of low blood, and sent him word they would none of his gifts, but</a>
<a id='line_1422'>that they were come to give him gifts with hard swords betwixt the neck</a>
<a id='line_1423'>and the shoulders: and therefore they came thither, so they told to the</a>
<a id='line_1424'>messengers plainly, for it was great shame to all them to see such a</a>
<a id='line_1425'>boy to have a rule of so noble a realm as this land was. With this</a>
<a id='line_1426'>answer the messengers departed and told to King Arthur this answer.</a>
<a id='line_1427'>Wherefore, by the advice of his barons, he took him to a strong tower</a>
<a id='line_1428'>with five hundred good men with him. And all the kings aforesaid in a</a>
<a id='line_1429'>manner laid a siege to-fore him, but King Arthur was well victualed.</a>
<a id='line_1430'>And within fifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of</a>
<a id='line_1431'>Carlion. Then all the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him,</a>
<a id='line_1432'>For what cause is that boy Arthur made your king? Sirs, said Merlin, I</a>
<a id='line_1433'>shall tell you the cause, for he is King Uther Pendragon’s son, born in</a>
<a id='line_1434'>wedlock, gotten on Igraine, the duke’s wife of Tintagil. Then is he a</a>
<a id='line_1435'>bastard, they said all. Nay, said Merlin, after the death of the duke,</a>
<a id='line_1436'>more than three hours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after</a>
<a id='line_1437'>King Uther wedded Igraine; and therefore I prove him he is no bastard.</a>
<a id='line_1438'>And who saith nay, he shall be king and overcome all his enemies; and,</a>
<a id='line_1439'>or he die, he shall be long king of all England, and have under his</a>
<a id='line_1440'>obeissance Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will</a>
<a id='line_1441'>now rehearse. Some of the kings had marvel of Merlin’s words, and</a>
<a id='line_1442'>deemed well that it should be as he said; and some of them laughed him</a>
<a id='line_1443'>to scorn, as King Lot; and more other called him a witch. But then were</a>
<a id='line_1444'>they accorded with Merlin, that King Arthur should come out and speak</a>
<a id='line_1445'>with the kings, and to come safe and to go safe, such surance there was</a>
<a id='line_1446'>made. So Merlin went unto King Arthur, and told him how he had done,</a>
<a id='line_1447'>and bade him fear not, but come out boldly and speak with them, and</a>
<a id='line_1448'>spare them not, but answer them as their king and chieftain; for ye</a>
<a id='line_1449'>shall overcome them all, whether they will or nill.</a>

<a id='line_1453'>CHAPTER IX. Of the first war that King Arthur had, and how he won the</a>
<a id='line_1454'>field.</a>
<a id='line_1455'></a>
<a id='line_1456'>Then King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a</a>
<a id='line_1457'>jesseraunt of double mail, and there went with him the Archbishop of</a>
<a id='line_1458'>Canterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias:</a>
<a id='line_1459'>these were the men of most worship that were with him. And when they</a>
<a id='line_1460'>were met there was no meekness, but stout words on both sides; but</a>
<a id='line_1461'>always King Arthur answered them, and said he would make them to bow an</a>
<a id='line_1462'>he lived. Wherefore they departed with wrath, and King Arthur bade keep</a>
<a id='line_1463'>them well, and they bade the king keep him well. So the king returned</a>
<a id='line_1464'>him to the tower again and armed him and all his knights. What will ye</a>
<a id='line_1465'>do? said Merlin to the kings; ye were better for to stint, for ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1466'>not here prevail though ye were ten times so many. Be we well advised</a>
<a id='line_1467'>to be afeared of a dream-reader? said King Lot. With that Merlin</a>
<a id='line_1468'>vanished away, and came to King Arthur, and bade him set on them</a>
<a id='line_1469'>fiercely; and in the meanwhile there were three hundred good men, of</a>
<a id='line_1470'>the best that were with the kings, that went straight unto King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1471'>and that comforted him greatly. Sir, said Merlin to Arthur, fight not</a>
<a id='line_1472'>with the sword that ye had by miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the</a>
<a id='line_1473'>worse, then draw it out and do your best. So forthwithal King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1474'>set upon them in their lodging. And Sir Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1475'>Brastias slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was</a>
<a id='line_1476'>marvel; and always King Arthur on horseback laid on with a sword, and</a>
<a id='line_1477'>did marvellous deeds of arms, that many of the kings had great joy of</a>
<a id='line_1478'>his deeds and hardiness.</a>
<a id='line_1479'></a>
<a id='line_1480'>Then King Lot brake out on the back side, and the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_1481'>Knights, and King Carados, and set on Arthur fiercely behind him. With</a>
<a id='line_1482'>that Sir Arthur turned with his knights, and smote behind and before,</a>
<a id='line_1483'>and ever Sir Arthur was in the foremost press till his horse was slain</a>
<a id='line_1484'>underneath him. And therewith King Lot smote down King Arthur. With</a>
<a id='line_1485'>that his four knights received him and set him on horseback. Then he</a>
<a id='line_1486'>drew his sword Excalibur, but it was so bright in his enemies’ eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1487'>that it gave light like thirty torches. And therewith he put them</a>
<a id='line_1488'>a-back, and slew much people. And then the commons of Carlion arose</a>
<a id='line_1489'>with clubs and staves and slew many knights; but all the kings held</a>
<a id='line_1490'>them together with their knights that were left alive, and so fled and</a>
<a id='line_1491'>departed. And Merlin came unto Arthur, and counselled him to follow</a>
<a id='line_1492'>them no further.</a>

<a id='line_1497'>King Bors, and of their counsel taken for the war.</a>
<a id='line_1498'></a>
<a id='line_1499'>So after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him unto London, and</a>
<a id='line_1500'>so by the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his barons to council,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>for Merlin had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him</a>
<a id='line_1502'>would in all haste be awroke on him and on his lands. Wherefore the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>king asked counsel at them all. They could no counsel give, but said</a>
<a id='line_1504'>they were big enough. Ye say well, said Arthur; I thank you for your</a>
<a id='line_1505'>good courage, but will ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin? ye know</a>
<a id='line_1506'>well that he hath done much for me, and he knoweth many things, and</a>
<a id='line_1507'>when he is afore you, I would that ye prayed him heartily of his best</a>
<a id='line_1508'>advice. All the barons said they would pray him and desire him. So</a>
<a id='line_1509'>Merlin was sent for, and fair desired of all the barons to give them</a>
<a id='line_1510'>best counsel. I shall say you, said Merlin, I warn you all, your</a>
<a id='line_1511'>enemies are passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms as be</a>
<a id='line_1512'>alive, and by this time they have gotten to them four kings more, and a</a>
<a id='line_1513'>mighty duke; and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than</a>
<a id='line_1514'>he may make within the bounds of his own realm, an he fight with them</a>
<a id='line_1515'>in battle, he shall be overcome and slain. What were best to do in this</a>
<a id='line_1516'>cause? said all the barons. I shall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice;</a>
<a id='line_1517'>there are two brethren beyond the sea, and they be kings both, and</a>
<a id='line_1518'>marvellous good men of their hands; and that one hight King Ban of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>Benwick, and that other hight King Bors of Gaul, that is France. And on</a>
<a id='line_1520'>these two kings warreth a mighty man of men, the King Claudas, and</a>
<a id='line_1521'>striveth with them for a castle, and great war is betwixt them. But</a>
<a id='line_1522'>this Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he getteth good knights,</a>
<a id='line_1523'>that he putteth these two kings most part to the worse; wherefore this</a>
<a id='line_1524'>is my counsel, that our king and sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban</a>
<a id='line_1525'>and Bors by two trusty knights with letters well devised, that an they</a>
<a id='line_1526'>will come and see King Arthur and his court, and so help him in his</a>
<a id='line_1527'>wars, that he will be sworn unto them to help them in their wars</a>
<a id='line_1528'>against King Claudas. Now, what say ye unto this counsel? said Merlin.</a>
<a id='line_1529'>This is well counselled, said the king and all the barons.</a>
<a id='line_1530'></a>
<a id='line_1531'>Right so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the</a>
<a id='line_1532'>message unto the two kings. So were there made letters in the pleasant</a>
<a id='line_1533'>wise according unto King Arthur’s desire. Ulfius and Brastias were made</a>
<a id='line_1534'>the messengers, and so rode forth well horsed and well armed and as the</a>
<a id='line_1535'>guise was that time, and so passed the sea and rode toward the city of</a>
<a id='line_1536'>Benwick. And there besides were eight knights that espied them, and at</a>
<a id='line_1537'>a strait passage they met with Ulfius and Brastias, and would have</a>
<a id='line_1538'>taken them prisoners; so they prayed them that they might pass, for</a>
<a id='line_1539'>they were messengers unto King Ban and Bors sent from King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1540'>Therefore, said the eight knights, ye shall die or be prisoners, for we</a>
<a id='line_1541'>be knights of King Claudas. And therewith two of them dressed their</a>
<a id='line_1542'>spears, and Ulfius and Brastias dressed their spears, and ran together</a>
<a id='line_1543'>with great raundon. And Claudas’ knights brake their spears, and theirs</a>
<a id='line_1544'>to-held and bare the two knights out of their saddles to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_1545'>so left them lying, and rode their ways. And the other six knights rode</a>
<a id='line_1546'>afore to a passage to meet with them again, and so Ulfius and Brastias</a>
<a id='line_1547'>smote other two down, and so passed on their ways. And at the fourth</a>
<a id='line_1548'>passage there met two for two, and both were laid unto the earth; so</a>
<a id='line_1549'>there was none of the eight knights but he was sore hurt or bruised.</a>
<a id='line_1550'>And when they come to Benwick it fortuned there were both kings, Ban</a>
<a id='line_1551'>and Bors.</a>
<a id='line_1552'></a>
<a id='line_1553'>And when it was told the kings that there were come messengers, there</a>
<a id='line_1554'>were sent unto them two knights of worship, the one hight Lionses, lord</a>
<a id='line_1555'>of the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance a worshipful knight. Anon</a>
<a id='line_1556'>they asked from whence they came, and they said from King Arthur, king</a>
<a id='line_1557'>of England; so they took them in their arms and made great joy each of</a>
<a id='line_1558'>other. But anon, as the two kings wist they were messengers of</a>
<a id='line_1559'>Arthur’s, there was made no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>knights, and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were</a>
<a id='line_1561'>most welcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they</a>
<a id='line_1562'>kissed the letters and delivered them. And when Ban and Bors understood</a>
<a id='line_1563'>the letters, then they were more welcome than they were before. And</a>
<a id='line_1564'>after the haste of the letters they gave them this answer, that they</a>
<a id='line_1565'>would fulfil the desire of King Arthur’s writing, and Ulfius and</a>
<a id='line_1566'>Brastias, tarry there as long as they would, they should have such</a>
<a id='line_1567'>cheer as might be made them in those marches. Then Ulfius and Brastias</a>
<a id='line_1568'>told the kings of the adventure at their passages of the eight knights.</a>
<a id='line_1569'>Ha! ah! said Ban and Bors, they were my good friends. I would I had</a>
<a id='line_1570'>wist of them; they should not have escaped so. So Ulfius and Brastias</a>
<a id='line_1571'>had good cheer and great gifts, as much as they might bear away; and</a>
<a id='line_1572'>had their answer by mouth and by writing, that those two kings would</a>
<a id='line_1573'>come unto Arthur in all the haste that they might. So the two knights</a>
<a id='line_1574'>rode on afore, and passed the sea, and came to their lord, and told him</a>
<a id='line_1575'>how they had sped, whereof King Arthur was passing glad. At what time</a>
<a id='line_1576'>suppose ye the two kings will be here? Sir, said they, afore All</a>
<a id='line_1577'>Hallowmass. Then the king let purvey for a great feast, and let cry a</a>
<a id='line_1578'>great jousts. And by All Hallowmass the two kings were come over the</a>
<a id='line_1579'>sea with three hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for</a>
<a id='line_1580'>the war. And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and</a>
<a id='line_1581'>there was great joy as could be thought or made. And on All Hallowmass</a>
<a id='line_1582'>at the great feast, sat in the hall the three kings, and Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_1583'>seneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, that was Duke</a>
<a id='line_1584'>Corneus’ son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of Cardol, these three</a>
<a id='line_1585'>knights had the rule of all the service that served the kings. And</a>
<a id='line_1586'>anon, as they had washen and risen, all knights that would joust made</a>
<a id='line_1587'>them ready; by then they were ready on horseback there were seven</a>
<a id='line_1588'>hundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and Bors, with the Archbishop of</a>
<a id='line_1589'>Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay’s father, they were in a place covered</a>
<a id='line_1590'>with cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and gentlewomen, for to</a>
<a id='line_1591'>behold who did best, and thereon to give judgment.</a>

<a id='line_1593'></a>
<a id='line_1594'></a>
<a id='line_1595'>CHAPTER XI. Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two kings</a>
<a id='line_1596'>Ban and Bors, and how they went over the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1597'></a>
<a id='line_1598'>And King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights</a>
<a id='line_1599'>in two parties. And there were three hundred knights of the realm of</a>
<a id='line_1600'>Benwick and of Gaul turned on the other side. Then they dressed their</a>
<a id='line_1601'>shields, and began to couch their spears many good knights. So Griflet</a>
<a id='line_1602'>was the first that met with a knight, one Ladinas, and they met so</a>
<a id='line_1603'>eagerly that all men had wonder; and they so fought that their shields</a>
<a id='line_1604'>fell to pieces, and horse and man fell to the earth; and both the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>French knight and the English knight lay so long that all men weened</a>
<a id='line_1606'>they had been dead. When Lucas the butler saw Griflet so lie, he horsed</a>
<a id='line_1607'>him again anon, and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many</a>
<a id='line_1608'>bachelors. Also Sir Kay came out of an ambushment with five knights</a>
<a id='line_1609'>with him, and they six smote other six down. But Sir Kay did that day</a>
<a id='line_1610'>marvellous deeds of arms, that there was none did so well as he that</a>
<a id='line_1611'>day. Then there came Ladinas and Gracian, two knights of France, and</a>
<a id='line_1612'>did passing well, that all men praised them.</a>
<a id='line_1613'></a>
<a id='line_1614'>Then came there Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met with Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_1615'>smote him down horse and man, where fore Sir Griflet was wroth, and met</a>
<a id='line_1616'>with Sir Placidas so hard, that horse and man fell to the earth. But</a>
<a id='line_1617'>when the five knights wist that Sir Kay had a fall, they were wroth out</a>
<a id='line_1618'>of wit, and therewith each of them five bare down a knight. When King</a>
<a id='line_1619'>Arthur and the two kings saw them begin to wax wroth on both parties,</a>
<a id='line_1620'>they leapt on small hackneys, and let cry that all men should depart</a>
<a id='line_1621'>unto their lodging. And so they went home and unarmed them, and so to</a>
<a id='line_1622'>evensong and supper. And after, the three kings went into a garden, and</a>
<a id='line_1623'>gave the prize unto Sir Kay, and to Lucas the butler, and unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_1624'>Griflet. And then they went unto council, and with them Gwenbaus, the</a>
<a id='line_1625'>brother unto Sir Ban and Bors, a wise clerk, and thither went Ulfius</a>
<a id='line_1626'>and Brastias, and Merlin. And after they had been in council, they went</a>
<a id='line_1627'>unto bed. And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to</a>
<a id='line_1628'>their council, and made many arguments what were best to do. At the</a>
<a id='line_1629'>last they were concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King</a>
<a id='line_1630'>Ban, and that was a ring, unto his men and King Bors’; and Gracian and</a>
<a id='line_1631'>Placidas should go again and keep their castles and their countries, as</a>
<a id='line_1632'>for [dread of King Claudas] King Ban of Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul</a>
<a id='line_1633'>had ordained them, and so passed the sea and came to Benwick. And when</a>
<a id='line_1634'>the people saw King Ban’s ring, and Gracian and Placidas, they were</a>
<a id='line_1635'>glad, and asked how the kings fared, and made great joy of their</a>
<a id='line_1636'>welfare and cording, and according unto the sovereign lords desire, the</a>
<a id='line_1637'>men of war made them ready in all haste possible, so that they were</a>
<a id='line_1638'>fifteen thousand on horse and foot, and they had great plenty of</a>
<a id='line_1639'>victual with them, by Merlin’s provision. But Gracian and Placidas were</a>
<a id='line_1640'>left to furnish and garnish the castles, for dread of King Claudas.</a>
<a id='line_1641'>Right so Merlin passed the sea, well victualled both by water and by</a>
<a id='line_1642'>land. And when he came to the sea he sent home the footmen again, and</a>
<a id='line_1643'>took no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback, the most part</a>
<a id='line_1644'>men of arms, and so shipped and passed the sea into England, and landed</a>
<a id='line_1645'>at Dover; and through the wit of Merlin, he had the host northward, the</a>
<a id='line_1646'>priviest way that could be thought, unto the forest of Bedegraine, and</a>
<a id='line_1647'>there in a valley he lodged them secretly.</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>Then rode Merlin unto Arthur and the two kings, and told them how he</a>
<a id='line_1650'>had sped; whereof they had great marvel, that man on earth might speed</a>
<a id='line_1651'>so soon, and go and come. So Merlin told them ten thousand were in the</a>
<a id='line_1652'>forest of Bedegraine, well armed at all points. Then was there no more</a>
<a id='line_1653'>to say, but to horseback went all the host as Arthur had afore</a>
<a id='line_1654'>purveyed. So with twenty thousand he passed by night and day, but there</a>
<a id='line_1655'>was made such an ordinance afore by Merlin, that there should no man of</a>
<a id='line_1656'>war ride nor go in no country on this side Trent water, but if he had a</a>
<a id='line_1657'>token from King Arthur, where through the king’s enemies durst not ride</a>
<a id='line_1658'>as they did to-fore to espy.</a>

<a id='line_1662'>CHAPTER XII. How eleven kings gathered a great host against King</a>
<a id='line_1663'>Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>And so within a little space the three kings came unto the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1666'>Bedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and well beseen,</a>
<a id='line_1667'>whereof they had great joy, and victual they wanted none. This was the</a>
<a id='line_1668'>cause of the northern host: that they were reared for the despite and</a>
<a id='line_1669'>rebuke the six kings had at Carlion. And those six kings by their</a>
<a id='line_1670'>means, gat unto them five other kings; and thus they began to gather</a>
<a id='line_1671'>their people.</a>
<a id='line_1672'></a>
<a id='line_1673'>And now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave other,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>till they had destroyed Arthur. And then they made an oath. The first</a>
<a id='line_1675'>that began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet, that he would bring with</a>
<a id='line_1676'>him five thousand men of arms, the which were ready on horseback. Then</a>
<a id='line_1677'>sware King Brandegoris of Stranggore that he would bring five thousand</a>
<a id='line_1678'>men of arms on horseback. Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_1679'>he would bring three thousand men of arms. Then sware the King of the</a>
<a id='line_1680'>Hundred Knights, that was a passing good man and a young, that he would</a>
<a id='line_1681'>bring four thousand men of arms on horseback. Then there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1682'>Lot, a passing good knight, and Sir Gawain’s father, that he would</a>
<a id='line_1683'>bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1684'>Urience, that was Sir Uwain’s father, of the land of Gore, and he would</a>
<a id='line_1685'>bring six thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1686'>Idres of Cornwall, that he would bring five thousand men of arms on</a>
<a id='line_1687'>horseback. Also there swore King Cradelmas to bring five thousand men</a>
<a id='line_1688'>on horseback. Also there swore King Agwisance of Ireland to bring five</a>
<a id='line_1689'>thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Nentres to</a>
<a id='line_1690'>bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King</a>
<a id='line_1691'>Carados to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback. So their whole</a>
<a id='line_1692'>host was of clean men of arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot</a>
<a id='line_1693'>ten thousand of good men’s bodies. Then were they soon ready, and</a>
<a id='line_1694'>mounted upon horse and sent forth their fore-riders, for these eleven</a>
<a id='line_1695'>kings in their ways laid a siege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so</a>
<a id='line_1696'>they departed and drew toward Arthur, and left few to abide at the</a>
<a id='line_1697'>siege, for the castle of Bedegraine was holden of King Arthur, and the</a>
<a id='line_1698'>men that were therein were Arthur’s.</a>

<a id='line_1702'>CHAPTER XIII. Of a dream of the King with the Hundred Knights.</a>
<a id='line_1703'></a>
<a id='line_1704'>So by Merlin’s advice there were sent fore-riders to skim the country,</a>
<a id='line_1705'>and they met with the fore-riders of the north, and made them to tell</a>
<a id='line_1706'>which way the host came, and then they told it to Arthur, and by King</a>
<a id='line_1707'>Ban and Bors’ council they let burn and destroy all the country afore</a>
<a id='line_1708'>them, there they should ride.</a>
<a id='line_1709'></a>
<a id='line_1710'>The King with the Hundred Knights met a wonder dream two nights afore</a>
<a id='line_1711'>the battle, that there blew a great wind, and blew down their castles</a>
<a id='line_1712'>and their towns, and after that came a water and bare it all away. All</a>
<a id='line_1713'>that heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle. Then by</a>
<a id='line_1714'>counsel of Merlin, when they wist which way the eleven kings would ride</a>
<a id='line_1715'>and lodge that night, at midnight they set upon them, as they were in</a>
<a id='line_1716'>their pavilions. But the scout-watch by their host cried, Lords! at</a>
<a id='line_1717'>arms! for here be your enemies at your hand!</a>
<a id='line_1718'></a>
<a id='line_1719'></a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>CHAPTER XIV. How the eleven kings with their host fought against Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1722'>and his host, and many great feats of the war.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>Then King Arthur and King Ban and King Bors, with their good and trusty</a>
<a id='line_1725'>knights, set on them so fiercely that they made them overthrow their</a>
<a id='line_1726'>pavilions on their heads, but the eleven kings, by manly prowess of</a>
<a id='line_1727'>arms, took a fair champaign, but there was slain that morrowtide ten</a>
<a id='line_1728'>thousand good men’s bodies. And so they had afore them a strong</a>
<a id='line_1729'>passage, yet were they fifty thousand of hardy men. Then it drew toward</a>
<a id='line_1730'>day. Now shall ye do by mine advice, said Merlin unto the three kings:</a>
<a id='line_1731'>I would that King Ban and King Bors, with their fellowship of ten</a>
<a id='line_1732'>thousand men, were put in a wood here beside, in an ambushment, and</a>
<a id='line_1733'>keep them privy, and that they be laid or the light of the day come,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>and that they stir not till ye and your knights have fought with them</a>
<a id='line_1735'>long. And when it is daylight, dress your battle even afore them and</a>
<a id='line_1736'>the passage, that they may see all your host, for then will they be the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>more hardy, when they see you but about twenty thousand men, and cause</a>
<a id='line_1738'>them to be the gladder to suffer you and your host to come over the</a>
<a id='line_1739'>passage. All the three kings and the whole barons said that Merlin said</a>
<a id='line_1740'>passingly well, and it was done anon as Merlin had devised. So on the</a>
<a id='line_1741'>morn, when either host saw other, the host of the north was well</a>
<a id='line_1742'>comforted. Then to Ulfius and Brastias were delivered three thousand</a>
<a id='line_1743'>men of arms, and they set on them fiercely in the passage, and slew on</a>
<a id='line_1744'>the right hand and on the left hand that it was wonder to tell.</a>
<a id='line_1745'></a>
<a id='line_1746'>When that the eleven kings saw that there was so few a fellowship did</a>
<a id='line_1747'>such deeds of arms, they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely;</a>
<a id='line_1748'>and there was Sir Ulfius’s horse slain under him, but he did</a>
<a id='line_1749'>marvellously well on foot. But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King</a>
<a id='line_1750'>Clariance of Northumberland, were alway grievous on Ulfius. Then</a>
<a id='line_1751'>Brastias saw his fellow fared so withal he smote the duke with a spear,</a>
<a id='line_1752'>that horse and man fell down. That saw King Clariance and returned unto</a>
<a id='line_1753'>Brastias, and either smote other so that horse and man went to the</a>
<a id='line_1754'>earth, and so they lay long astonied, and their horses’ knees brast to</a>
<a id='line_1755'>the hard bone. Then came Sir Kay the seneschal with six fellows with</a>
<a id='line_1756'>him, and did passing well. With that came the eleven kings, and there</a>
<a id='line_1757'>was Griflet put to the earth, horse and man, and Lucas the butler,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>horse and man, by King Brandegoris, and King Idres, and King Agwisance.</a>
<a id='line_1759'>Then waxed the medley passing hard on both parties. When Sir Kay saw</a>
<a id='line_1760'>Griflet on foot, he rode on King Nentres and smote him down, and led</a>
<a id='line_1761'>his horse unto Sir Griflet, and horsed him again. Also Sir Kay with the</a>
<a id='line_1762'>same spear smote down King Lot, and hurt him passing sore. That saw the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>King with the Hundred Knights, and ran unto Sir Kay and smote him down,</a>
<a id='line_1764'>and took his horse, and gave him King Lot, whereof he said gramercy.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>When Sir Griflet saw Sir Kay and Lucas the butler on foot, he took a</a>
<a id='line_1766'>sharp spear, great and square, and rode to Pinel, a good man of arms,</a>
<a id='line_1767'>and smote horse and man down, and then he took his horse, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_1768'>unto Sir Kay. Then King Lot saw King Nentres on foot, he ran unto Melot</a>
<a id='line_1769'>de la Roche, and smote him down, horse and man, and gave King Nentres</a>
<a id='line_1770'>the horse, and horsed him again. Also the King of the Hundred Knights</a>
<a id='line_1771'>saw King Idres on foot; then he ran unto Gwiniart de Bloi, and smote</a>
<a id='line_1772'>him down, horse and man, and gave King Idres the horse, and horsed him</a>
<a id='line_1773'>again; and King Lot smote down Clariance de la Forest Savage, and gave</a>
<a id='line_1774'>the horse unto Duke Eustace. And so when they had horsed the kings</a>
<a id='line_1775'>again they drew them, all eleven kings, together, and said they would</a>
<a id='line_1776'>be revenged of the damage that they had taken that day. The meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_1777'>came in Sir Ector with an eager countenance, and found Ulfius and</a>
<a id='line_1778'>Brastias on foot, in great peril of death, that were foul defoiled</a>
<a id='line_1779'>under horse-feet.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>Then Arthur as a lion, ran unto King Cradelment of North Wales, and</a>
<a id='line_1782'>smote him through the left side, that the horse and the king fell down;</a>
<a id='line_1783'>and then he took the horse by the rein, and led him unto Ulfius, and</a>
<a id='line_1784'>said, Have this horse, mine old friend, for great need hast thou of</a>
<a id='line_1785'>horse. Gramercy, said Ulfius. Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in</a>
<a id='line_1786'>arms, that all men had wonder. When the King with the Hundred Knights</a>
<a id='line_1787'>saw King Cradelment on foot, he ran unto Sir Ector, that was well</a>
<a id='line_1788'>horsed, Sir Kay’s father, and smote horse and man down, and gave the</a>
<a id='line_1789'>horse unto the king, and horsed him again. And when King Arthur saw the</a>
<a id='line_1790'>king ride on Sir Ector’s horse, he was wroth and with his sword he</a>
<a id='line_1791'>smote the king on the helm, that a quarter of the helm and shield fell</a>
<a id='line_1792'>down, and so the sword carved down unto the horse’s neck, and so the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>king and the horse fell down to the ground. Then Sir Kay came unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_1794'>Morganore, seneschal with the King of the Hundred Knights, and smote</a>
<a id='line_1795'>him down, horse and man, and led the horse unto his father, Sir Ector;</a>
<a id='line_1796'>then Sir Ector ran unto a knight, hight Lardans, and smote horse and</a>
<a id='line_1797'>man down, and led the horse unto Sir Brastias, that great need had of</a>
<a id='line_1798'>an horse, and was greatly defoiled. When Brastias beheld Lucas the</a>
<a id='line_1799'>butler, that lay like a dead man under the horses’ feet, and ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_1800'>Griflet did marvellously for to rescue him, and there were always</a>
<a id='line_1801'>fourteen knights on Sir Lucas; then Brastias smote one of them on the</a>
<a id='line_1802'>helm, that it went to the teeth, and he rode to another and smote him,</a>
<a id='line_1803'>that the arm flew into the field. Then he went to the third and smote</a>
<a id='line_1804'>him on the shoulder, that shoulder and arm flew in the field. And when</a>
<a id='line_1805'>Griflet saw rescues, he smote a knight on the temples, that head and</a>
<a id='line_1806'>helm went to the earth, and Griflet took the horse of that knight, and</a>
<a id='line_1807'>led him unto Sir Lucas, and bade him mount upon the horse and revenge</a>
<a id='line_1808'>his hurts. For Brastias had slain a knight to-fore and horsed Griflet.</a>
<a id='line_1809'></a>

<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>CHAPTER XV. Yet of the same battle.</a>
<a id='line_1813'></a>
<a id='line_1814'>Then Lucas saw King Agwisance, that late had slain Moris de la Roche,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>and Lucas ran to him with a short spear that was great, that he gave</a>
<a id='line_1816'>him such a fall, that the horse fell down to the earth. Also Lucas</a>
<a id='line_1817'>found there on foot, Bloias de La Flandres, and Sir Gwinas, two hardy</a>
<a id='line_1818'>knights, and in that woodness that Lucas was in, he slew two bachelors</a>
<a id='line_1819'>and horsed them again. Then waxed the battle passing hard on both</a>
<a id='line_1820'>parties, but Arthur was glad that his knights were horsed again, and</a>
<a id='line_1821'>then they fought together, that the noise and sound rang by the water</a>
<a id='line_1822'>and the wood. Wherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready, and</a>
<a id='line_1823'>dressed their shields and harness, and they were so courageous that</a>
<a id='line_1824'>many knights shook and bevered for eagerness. All this while Lucas, and</a>
<a id='line_1825'>Gwinas, and Briant, and Bellias of Flanders, held strong medley against</a>
<a id='line_1826'>six kings, that was King Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King</a>
<a id='line_1827'>Idres, King Uriens, and King Agwisance. So with the help of Sir Kay and</a>
<a id='line_1828'>of Sir Griflet they held these six kings hard, that unnethe they had</a>
<a id='line_1829'>any power to defend them. But when Sir Arthur saw the battle would not</a>
<a id='line_1830'>be ended by no manner, he fared wood as a lion, and steered his horse</a>
<a id='line_1831'>here and there, on the right hand, and on the left hand, that he</a>
<a id='line_1832'>stinted not till he had slain twenty knights. Also he wounded King Lot</a>
<a id='line_1833'>sore on the shoulder, and made him to leave that ground, for Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_1834'>and Griflet did with King Arthur there great deeds of arms. Then</a>
<a id='line_1835'>Ulfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector encountered against the Duke</a>
<a id='line_1836'>Eustace, and King Cradelment, and King Clariance of Northumberland, and</a>
<a id='line_1837'>King Carados, and against the King with the Hundred Knights. So these</a>
<a id='line_1838'>knights encountered with these kings, that they made them to avoid the</a>
<a id='line_1839'>ground. Then King Lot made great dole for his damages and his fellows,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>and said unto the ten kings, But if ye will do as I devise we shall be</a>
<a id='line_1841'>slain and destroyed; let me have the King with the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_1842'>King Agwisance, and King Idres, and the Duke of Cambenet, and we five</a>
<a id='line_1843'>kings will have fifteen thousand men of arms with us, and we will go</a>
<a id='line_1844'>apart while ye six kings hold medley with twelve thousand; an we see</a>
<a id='line_1845'>that ye have foughten with them long, then will we come on fiercely,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>and else shall we never match them, said King Lot, but by this mean. So</a>
<a id='line_1847'>they departed as they here devised, and six kings made their party</a>
<a id='line_1848'>strong against Arthur, and made great war long.</a>
<a id='line_1849'></a>
<a id='line_1850'>In the meanwhile brake the ambushment of King Ban and King Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_1851'>Lionses and Phariance had the vanguard, and they two knights met with</a>
<a id='line_1852'>King Idres and his fellowship, and there began a great medley of</a>
<a id='line_1853'>breaking of spears, and smiting of swords, with slaying of men and</a>
<a id='line_1854'>horses, and King Idres was near at discomforture.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>That saw Agwisance the king, and put Lionses and Phariance in point of</a>
<a id='line_1857'>death; for the Duke of Cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_1858'>So these two knights were in great danger of their lives that they were</a>
<a id='line_1859'>fain to return, but always they rescued themselves and their fellowship</a>
<a id='line_1860'>marvellously. When King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved</a>
<a id='line_1861'>him sore; then he came on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black</a>
<a id='line_1862'>as Inde. When King Lot had espied King Bors, he knew him well, then he</a>
<a id='line_1863'>said, O Jesu, defend us from death and horrible maims! for I see well</a>
<a id='line_1864'>we be in great peril of death; for I see yonder a king, one of the most</a>
<a id='line_1865'>worshipfullest men and one of the best knights of the world, is</a>
<a id='line_1866'>inclined unto his fellowship. What is he? said the King with the</a>
<a id='line_1867'>Hundred Knights. It is, said King Lot, King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how</a>
<a id='line_1868'>they came into this country without witting of us all. It was by</a>
<a id='line_1869'>Merlin’s advice, said the knight. As for him, said King Carados, I will</a>
<a id='line_1870'>encounter with King Bors, an ye will rescue me when myster is. Go on,</a>
<a id='line_1871'>said they all, we will do all that we may. Then King Carados and his</a>
<a id='line_1872'>host rode on a soft pace, till that they came as nigh King Bors as</a>
<a id='line_1873'>bow-draught; then either battle let their horse run as fast as they</a>
<a id='line_1874'>might. And Bleoberis, that was godson unto King Bors, he bare his chief</a>
<a id='line_1875'>standard, that was a passing good knight. Now shall we see, said King</a>
<a id='line_1876'>Bors, how these northern Britons can bear the arms: and King Bors</a>
<a id='line_1877'>encountered with a knight, and smote him throughout with a spear that</a>
<a id='line_1878'>he fell dead unto the earth; and after drew his sword and did</a>
<a id='line_1879'>marvellous deeds of arms, that all parties had great wonder thereof;</a>
<a id='line_1880'>and his knights failed not, but did their part, and King Carados was</a>
<a id='line_1881'>smitten to the earth. With that came the King with the Hundred Knights</a>
<a id='line_1882'>and rescued King Carados mightily by force of arms, for he was a</a>
<a id='line_1883'>passing good knight of a king, and but a young man.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'></a>
<a id='line_1886'></a>
<a id='line_1887'>CHAPTER XVI. Yet more of the same battle.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>By then came into the field King Ban as fierce as a lion, with bands of</a>
<a id='line_1890'>green and thereupon gold. Ha! a! said King Lot, we must be discomfited,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>for yonder I see the most valiant knight of the world, and the man of</a>
<a id='line_1892'>the most renown, for such two brethren as is King Ban and King Bors are</a>
<a id='line_1893'>not living, wherefore we must needs void or die; and but if we avoid</a>
<a id='line_1894'>manly and wisely there is but death. When King Ban came into the</a>
<a id='line_1895'>battle, he came in so fiercely that the strokes redounded again from</a>
<a id='line_1896'>the wood and the water; wherefore King Lot wept for pity and dole that</a>
<a id='line_1897'>he saw so many good knights take their end. But through the great force</a>
<a id='line_1898'>of King Ban they made both the northern battles that were departed</a>
<a id='line_1899'>hurtled together for great dread; and the three kings and their knights</a>
<a id='line_1900'>slew on ever, that it was pity on to behold that multitude of the</a>
<a id='line_1901'>people that fled. But King Lot, and King of the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_1902'>King Morganore gathered the people together passing knightly, and did</a>
<a id='line_1903'>great prowess of arms, and held the battle all that day, like hard.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>When the King of the Hundred Knights beheld the great damage that King</a>
<a id='line_1906'>Ban did, he thrust unto him with his horse, and smote him on high upon</a>
<a id='line_1907'>the helm, a great stroke, and astonied him sore. Then King Ban was</a>
<a id='line_1908'>wroth with him, and followed on him fiercely; the other saw that, and</a>
<a id='line_1909'>cast up his shield, and spurred his horse forward, but the stroke of</a>
<a id='line_1910'>King Ban fell down and carved a cantel off the shield, and the sword</a>
<a id='line_1911'>slid down by the hauberk behind his back, and cut through the trapping</a>
<a id='line_1912'>of steel and the horse even in two pieces, that the sword felt the</a>
<a id='line_1913'>earth. Then the King of the Hundred Knights voided the horse lightly,</a>
<a id='line_1914'>and with his sword he broached the horse of King Ban through and</a>
<a id='line_1915'>through. With that King Ban voided lightly from the dead horse, and</a>
<a id='line_1916'>then King Ban smote at the other so eagerly, and smote him on the helm</a>
<a id='line_1917'>that he fell to the earth. Also in that ire he felled King Morganore,</a>
<a id='line_1918'>and there was great slaughter of good knights and much people. By then</a>
<a id='line_1919'>came into the press King Arthur, and found King Ban standing among dead</a>
<a id='line_1920'>men and dead horses, fighting on foot as a wood lion, that there came</a>
<a id='line_1921'>none nigh him, as far as he might reach with his sword, but he caught a</a>
<a id='line_1922'>grievous buffet; whereof King Arthur had great pity. And Arthur was so</a>
<a id='line_1923'>bloody, that by his shield there might no man know him, for all was</a>
<a id='line_1924'>blood and brains on his sword. And as Arthur looked by him he saw a</a>
<a id='line_1925'>knight that was passingly well horsed, and therewith Sir Arthur ran to</a>
<a id='line_1926'>him, and smote him on the helm, that his sword went unto his teeth, and</a>
<a id='line_1927'>the knight sank down to the earth dead, and anon Arthur took the horse</a>
<a id='line_1928'>by the rein, and led him unto King Ban, and said, Fair brother, have</a>
<a id='line_1929'>this horse, for he have great myster thereof, and me repenteth sore of</a>
<a id='line_1930'>your great damage. It shall be soon revenged, said King Ban, for I</a>
<a id='line_1931'>trust in God mine ure is not such but some of them may sore repent</a>
<a id='line_1932'>this. I will well, said Arthur, for I see your deeds full actual;</a>
<a id='line_1933'>nevertheless, I might not come at you at that time.</a>
<a id='line_1934'></a>
<a id='line_1935'>But when King Ban was mounted on horseback, then there began new</a>
<a id='line_1936'>battle, the which was sore and hard, and passing great slaughter. And</a>
<a id='line_1937'>so through great force King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors made their</a>
<a id='line_1938'>knights a little to withdraw them. But alway the eleven kings with</a>
<a id='line_1939'>their chivalry never turned back; and so withdrew them to a little</a>
<a id='line_1940'>wood, and so over a little river, and there they rested them, for on</a>
<a id='line_1941'>the night they might have no rest on the field. And then the eleven</a>
<a id='line_1942'>kings and knights put them on a heap all together, as men adread and</a>
<a id='line_1943'>out of all comfort. But there was no man might pass them, they held</a>
<a id='line_1944'>them so hard together both behind and before, that King Arthur had</a>
<a id='line_1945'>marvel of their deeds of arms, and was passing wroth. Ah, Sir Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1946'>said King Ban and King Bors, blame them not, for they do as good men</a>
<a id='line_1947'>ought to do. For by my faith, said King Ban, they are the best fighting</a>
<a id='line_1948'>men, and knights of most prowess, that ever I saw or heard speak of,</a>
<a id='line_1949'>and those eleven kings are men of great worship; and if they were</a>
<a id='line_1950'>longing unto you there were no king under the heaven had such eleven</a>
<a id='line_1951'>knights, and of such worship. I may not love them, said Arthur, they</a>
<a id='line_1952'>would destroy me. That wot we well, said King Ban and King Bors, for</a>
<a id='line_1953'>they are your mortal enemies, and that hath been proved aforehand; and</a>
<a id='line_1954'>this day they have done their part, and that is great pity of their</a>
<a id='line_1955'>wilfulness.</a>
<a id='line_1956'></a>
<a id='line_1957'>Then all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>Lords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind;</a>
<a id='line_1959'>ye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because</a>
<a id='line_1960'>we wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the</a>
<a id='line_1961'>foot-men we lose ten horsemen for him; therefore this is mine advice,</a>
<a id='line_1962'>let us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble</a>
<a id='line_1963'>Arthur will not tarry on the footmen, for they may save themselves, the</a>
<a id='line_1964'>wood is near hand. And when we horsemen be together, look every each of</a>
<a id='line_1965'>you kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death.</a>
<a id='line_1966'>And who that seeth any man dress him to flee, lightly that he be slain,</a>
<a id='line_1967'>for it is better that we slay a coward, than through a coward all we to</a>
<a id='line_1968'>be slain. How say ye? said King Lot, answer me all ye kings. It is well</a>
<a id='line_1969'>said, quoth King Nentres; so said the King of the Hundred Knights; the</a>
<a id='line_1970'>same said the King Carados, and King Uriens; so did King Idres and King</a>
<a id='line_1971'>Brandegoris; and so did King Cradelment, and the Duke of Cambenet; the</a>
<a id='line_1972'>same said King Clariance and King Agwisance, and sware they would never</a>
<a id='line_1973'>fail other, neither for life nor for death. And whoso that fled, but</a>
<a id='line_1974'>did as they did, should be slain. Then they amended their harness, and</a>
<a id='line_1975'>righted their shields, and took new spears and set them on their</a>
<a id='line_1976'>thighs, and stood still as it had been a plump of wood.</a>
<a id='line_1977'></a>
<a id='line_1978'></a>
<a id='line_1979'></a>
<a id='line_1980'>CHAPTER XVII. Yet more of the same battle, and how it was ended by</a>
<a id='line_1981'>Merlin.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>When Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their</a>
<a id='line_1984'>knights, they praised them much for their noble cheer of chivalry, for</a>
<a id='line_1985'>the hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw. With that, there</a>
<a id='line_1986'>dressed them a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they</a>
<a id='line_1987'>would break their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance,</a>
<a id='line_1988'>Ulfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay, Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de</a>
<a id='line_1989'>Dieu, Mariet de la Roche, Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage,</a>
<a id='line_1990'>Bellaus, Morians of the Castle [of] Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle</a>
<a id='line_1991'>of Ladies, Annecians that was King Bors’ godson, a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_1992'>Ladinas de la Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois</a>
<a id='line_1993'>de la Case, and Sir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on</a>
<a id='line_1994'>afore with spears on their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as</a>
<a id='line_1995'>the horses might run. And the eleven kings with part of their knights</a>
<a id='line_1996'>rushed with their horses as fast as they might with their spears, and</a>
<a id='line_1997'>there they did on both parties marvellous deeds of arms. So came into</a>
<a id='line_1998'>the thick of the press, Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on</a>
<a id='line_1999'>both hands, that their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks. But</a>
<a id='line_2000'>ever the eleven kings and their host was ever in the visage of Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2001'>Wherefore Ban and Bors had great marvel, considering the great</a>
<a id='line_2002'>slaughter that there was, but at the last they were driven aback over a</a>
<a id='line_2003'>little river. With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and said</a>
<a id='line_2004'>unto Arthur, Thou hast never done! Hast thou not done enough? of three</a>
<a id='line_2005'>score thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand, and</a>
<a id='line_2006'>it is time to say Ho! For God is wroth with thee, that thou wilt never</a>
<a id='line_2007'>have done; for yonder eleven kings at this time will not be overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_2008'>but an thou tarry on them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they</a>
<a id='line_2009'>shall increase. And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest</a>
<a id='line_2010'>you as soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with</a>
<a id='line_2011'>silver, for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be too dear</a>
<a id='line_2012'>for them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never men did more</a>
<a id='line_2013'>of prowess than they have done today, for ye have matched this day with</a>
<a id='line_2014'>the best fighters of the world. That is truth, said King Ban and Bors.</a>
<a id='line_2015'>Also said Merlin, withdraw you where ye list, for this three year I</a>
<a id='line_2016'>dare undertake they shall not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new</a>
<a id='line_2017'>tidings. And then Merlin said unto Arthur, These eleven kings have more</a>
<a id='line_2018'>on hand than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their</a>
<a id='line_2019'>countries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have laid</a>
<a id='line_2020'>siege at the castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction; therefore</a>
<a id='line_2021'>dread you not this three year. Also, sir, all the goods that be gotten</a>
<a id='line_2022'>at this battle, let it be searched, and when ye have it in your hands,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>let it be given freely unto these two kings, Ban and Bors, that they</a>
<a id='line_2024'>may reward their knights withal; and that shall cause strangers to be</a>
<a id='line_2025'>of better will to do you service at need. Also you be able to reward</a>
<a id='line_2026'>your own knights of your own goods whensomever it liketh you. It is</a>
<a id='line_2027'>well said, quoth Arthur, and as thou hast devised, so shall it be done.</a>
<a id='line_2028'>When it was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the goods as freely to</a>
<a id='line_2029'>their knights as freely as it was given to them. Then Merlin took his</a>
<a id='line_2030'>leave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see his master</a>
<a id='line_2031'>Bleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he departed and came to</a>
<a id='line_2032'>his master, that was passing glad of his coming; and there he told how</a>
<a id='line_2033'>Arthur and the two kings had sped at the great battle, and how it was</a>
<a id='line_2034'>ended, and told the names of every king and knight of worship that was</a>
<a id='line_2035'>there. And so Bleise wrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him,</a>
<a id='line_2036'>how it began, and by whom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who</a>
<a id='line_2037'>had the worse. All the battles that were done in Arthur’s days Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2038'>did his master Bleise do write; also he did do write all the battles</a>
<a id='line_2039'>that every worthy knight did of Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_2040'></a>
<a id='line_2041'>After this Merlin departed from his master and came to King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>that was in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that</a>
<a id='line_2043'>stand in the forest of Sherwood. And Merlin was so disguised that King</a>
<a id='line_2044'>Arthur knew him not, for he was all befurred in black sheep-skins, and</a>
<a id='line_2045'>a great pair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and</a>
<a id='line_2046'>brought wild geese in his hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas</a>
<a id='line_2047'>day; but King Arthur knew him not. Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will</a>
<a id='line_2048'>ye give me a gift? Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a</a>
<a id='line_2049'>gift, churl? Sir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is</a>
<a id='line_2050'>not in your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place</a>
<a id='line_2051'>where the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth. Who</a>
<a id='line_2052'>told thee so, churl? said Arthur. Merlin told me so, said he. Then</a>
<a id='line_2053'>Ulfius and Brastias knew him well enough, and smiled. Sir, said these</a>
<a id='line_2054'>two knights, it is Merlin that so speaketh unto you. Then King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_2055'>was greatly abashed, and had marvel of Merlin, and so had King Ban and</a>
<a id='line_2056'>King Bors, and so they had great disport at him. So in the meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_2057'>there came a damosel that was an earl’s daughter: his name was Sanam,</a>
<a id='line_2058'>and her name was Lionors, a passing fair damosel; and so she came</a>
<a id='line_2059'>thither for to do homage, as other lords did after the great battle.</a>
<a id='line_2060'>And King Arthur set his love greatly upon her, and so did she upon him,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>and the king had ado with her, and gat on her a child: his name was</a>
<a id='line_2062'>Borre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table Round. Then there</a>
<a id='line_2063'>came word that the King Rience of North Wales made great war on King</a>
<a id='line_2064'>Leodegrance of Cameliard, for the which thing Arthur was wroth, for he</a>
<a id='line_2065'>loved him well, and hated King Rience, for he was alway against him. So</a>
<a id='line_2066'>by ordinance of the three kings that were sent home unto Benwick, all</a>
<a id='line_2067'>they would depart for dread of King Claudas; and Phariance, and</a>
<a id='line_2068'>Antemes, and Gratian, and Lionses [of] Payarne, with the leaders of</a>
<a id='line_2069'>those that should keep the kings’ lands.</a>

<a id='line_2074'>Leodegrance, and other incidents.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>And then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their</a>
<a id='line_2077'>fellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the</a>
<a id='line_2078'>country of Cameliard, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew</a>
<a id='line_2079'>there much people of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>and put him to flight. And then had these three kings great cheer of</a>
<a id='line_2081'>King Leodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they</a>
<a id='line_2082'>would revenge him of his enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight</a>
<a id='line_2083'>of Guenever, the king’s daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he loved</a>
<a id='line_2084'>her. After they were wedded, as it telleth in the book. So, briefly to</a>
<a id='line_2085'>make an end, they took their leave to go into their own countries, for</a>
<a id='line_2086'>King Claudas did great destruction on their lands. Then said Arthur, I</a>
<a id='line_2087'>will go with you. Nay, said the kings, ye shall not at this time, for</a>
<a id='line_2088'>ye have much to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and</a>
<a id='line_2089'>with the great goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>we shall wage good knights and withstand the King Claudas’ malice, for</a>
<a id='line_2091'>by the grace of God, an we have need we will send to you for your</a>
<a id='line_2092'>succour; and if ye have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by</a>
<a id='line_2093'>the faith of our bodies. It shall not, said Merlin, need that these two</a>
<a id='line_2094'>kings come again in the way of war, but I know well King Arthur may not</a>
<a id='line_2095'>be long from you, for within a year or two ye shall have great need,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>and then shall he revenge you on your enemies, as ye have done on his.</a>
<a id='line_2097'>For these eleven kings shall die all in a day, by the great might and</a>
<a id='line_2098'>prowess of arms of two valiant knights (as it telleth after); their</a>
<a id='line_2099'>names be Balin le Savage, and Balan, his brother, that be marvellous</a>
<a id='line_2100'>good knights as be any living.</a>
<a id='line_2101'></a>
<a id='line_2102'>Now turn we to the eleven kings that returned unto a city that hight</a>
<a id='line_2103'>Sorhaute, the which city was within King Uriens’, and there they</a>
<a id='line_2104'>refreshed them as well as they might, and made leeches search their</a>
<a id='line_2105'>wounds, and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people. With that</a>
<a id='line_2106'>there came a messenger and told how there was come into their lands</a>
<a id='line_2107'>people that were lawless as well as Saracens, a forty thousand, and</a>
<a id='line_2108'>have burnt and slain all the people that they may come by, without</a>
<a id='line_2109'>mercy, and have laid siege on the castle of Wandesborow. Alas, said the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>eleven kings, here is sorrow upon sorrow, and if we had not warred</a>
<a id='line_2111'>against Arthur as we have done, he would soon revenge us. As for King</a>
<a id='line_2112'>Leodegrance, he loveth Arthur better than us, and as for King Rience,</a>
<a id='line_2113'>he hath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he hath laid siege unto him.</a>
<a id='line_2114'>So they consented together to keep all the marches of Cornwall, of</a>
<a id='line_2115'>Wales, and of the North. So first, they put King Idres in the City of</a>
<a id='line_2116'>Nauntes in Britain, with four thousand men of arms, to watch both the</a>
<a id='line_2117'>water and the land. Also they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres</a>
<a id='line_2118'>of Garlot, with four thousand knights to watch both on water and on</a>
<a id='line_2119'>land. Also they had of other men of war more than eight thousand, for</a>
<a id='line_2120'>to fortify all the fortresses in the marches of Cornwall. Also they put</a>
<a id='line_2121'>more knights in all the marches of Wales and Scotland, with many good</a>
<a id='line_2122'>men of arms, and so they kept them together the space of three year,</a>
<a id='line_2123'>and ever allied them with mighty kings and dukes and lords. And to them</a>
<a id='line_2124'>fell King Rience of North Wales, the which and Nero that was a mighty</a>
<a id='line_2125'>man of men. And all this while they furnished them and garnished them</a>
<a id='line_2126'>of good men of arms, and victual, and of all manner of habiliment that</a>
<a id='line_2127'>pretendeth to the war, to avenge them for the battle of Bedegraine, as</a>
<a id='line_2128'>it telleth in the book of adventures following.</a>
<a id='line_2129'></a>
<a id='line_2130'></a>
<a id='line_2131'></a>
<a id='line_2132'>CHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur rode to Carlion, and of his dream, and how</a>
<a id='line_2133'>he saw the questing beast.</a>
<a id='line_2134'></a>
<a id='line_2135'>Then after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King Arthur rode</a>
<a id='line_2136'>into Carlion. And thither came to him, King Lot’s wife, of Orkney, in</a>
<a id='line_2137'>manner of a message, but she was sent thither to espy the court of King</a>
<a id='line_2138'>Arthur; and she came richly beseen, with her four sons, Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>Gaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies. For</a>
<a id='line_2140'>she was a passing fair lady, therefore the king cast great love unto</a>
<a id='line_2141'>her, and desired to lie by her; so they were agreed, and he begat upon</a>
<a id='line_2142'>her Mordred, and she was his sister, on his mother’s side, Igraine. So</a>
<a id='line_2143'>there she rested her a month, and at the last departed. Then the king</a>
<a id='line_2144'>dreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread. But all this</a>
<a id='line_2145'>time King Arthur knew not that King Lot’s wife was his sister. Thus was</a>
<a id='line_2146'>the dream of Arthur: Him thought there was come into this land griffins</a>
<a id='line_2147'>and serpents, and him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the</a>
<a id='line_2148'>land, and then him thought he fought with them, and they did him</a>
<a id='line_2149'>passing great harm, and wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew</a>
<a id='line_2150'>them. When the king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so</a>
<a id='line_2151'>to put it out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride</a>
<a id='line_2152'>a-hunting. As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great hart</a>
<a id='line_2153'>afore him. This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so he spurred</a>
<a id='line_2154'>the horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft he was like to</a>
<a id='line_2155'>have smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so long,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>that his horse lost his breath, and fell down dead. Then a yeoman</a>
<a id='line_2157'>fetched the king another horse.</a>
<a id='line_2158'></a>
<a id='line_2159'>So the king saw the hart enbushed, and his horse dead, he set him down</a>
<a id='line_2160'>by a fountain, and there he fell in great thoughts. And as he sat so,</a>
<a id='line_2161'>him thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of thirty. And with</a>
<a id='line_2162'>that the king saw coming toward him the strangest beast that ever he</a>
<a id='line_2163'>saw or heard of; so the beast went to the well and drank, and the noise</a>
<a id='line_2164'>was in the beast’s belly like unto the questing of thirty couple</a>
<a id='line_2165'>hounds; but all the while the beast drank there was no noise in the</a>
<a id='line_2166'>beast’s belly: and there with the beast departed with a great noise,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>whereof the king had great marvel. And so he was in a great thought,</a>
<a id='line_2168'>and therewith he fell asleep. Right so there came a knight afoot unto</a>
<a id='line_2169'>Arthur and said, Knight full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou</a>
<a id='line_2170'>sawest a strange beast pass this way. Such one saw I, said King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2171'>that is past two mile; what would ye with the beast? said Arthur. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2172'>I have followed that beast long time, and killed mine horse, so would</a>
<a id='line_2173'>God I had another to follow my quest. Right so came one with the king’s</a>
<a id='line_2174'>horse, and when the knight saw the horse, he prayed the king to give</a>
<a id='line_2175'>him the horse: for I have followed this quest this twelvemonth, and</a>
<a id='line_2176'>either I shall achieve him, or bleed of the best blood of my body.</a>
<a id='line_2177'>Pellinore, that time king, followed the Questing Beast, and after his</a>
<a id='line_2178'>death Sir Palamides followed it.</a>
<a id='line_2179'></a>
<a id='line_2180'></a>
<a id='line_2181'></a>
<a id='line_2182'>CHAPTER XX. How King Pellinore took Arthur’s horse and followed the</a>
<a id='line_2183'>Questing Beast, and how Merlin met with Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2184'></a>
<a id='line_2185'>Sir knight, said the king, leave that quest, and suffer me to have it,</a>
<a id='line_2186'>and I will follow it another twelvemonth. Ah, fool, said the knight</a>
<a id='line_2187'>unto Arthur, it is in vain thy desire, for it shall never be achieved</a>
<a id='line_2188'>but by me, or my next kin. Therewith he started unto the king’s horse</a>
<a id='line_2189'>and mounted into the saddle, and said, Gramercy, this horse is my own.</a>
<a id='line_2190'>Well, said the king, thou mayst take my horse by force, but an I might</a>
<a id='line_2191'>prove thee whether thou were better on horseback or I.—Well, said the</a>
<a id='line_2192'>knight, seek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh this well thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2193'>find me, and so passed on his way. Then the king sat in a study, and</a>
<a id='line_2194'>bade his men fetch his horse as fast as ever they might. Right so came</a>
<a id='line_2195'>by him Merlin like a child of fourteen year of age, and saluted the</a>
<a id='line_2196'>king, and asked him why he was so pensive. I may well be pensive, said</a>
<a id='line_2197'>the king, for I have seen the marvellest sight that ever I saw. That</a>
<a id='line_2198'>know I well, said Merlin, as well as thyself, and of all thy thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_2199'>but thou art but a fool to take thought, for it will not amend thee.</a>
<a id='line_2200'>Also I know what thou art, and who was thy father, and of whom thou</a>
<a id='line_2201'>wert begotten; King Uther Pendragon was thy father, and begat thee on</a>
<a id='line_2202'>Igraine. That is false, said King Arthur, how shouldest thou know it,</a>
<a id='line_2203'>for thou art not so old of years to know my father? Yes, said Merlin, I</a>
<a id='line_2204'>know it better than ye or any man living. I will not believe thee, said</a>
<a id='line_2205'>Arthur, and was wroth with the child. So departed Merlin, and came</a>
<a id='line_2206'>again in the likeness of an old man of fourscore year of age, whereof</a>
<a id='line_2207'>the king was right glad, for he seemed to be right wise.</a>
<a id='line_2208'></a>
<a id='line_2209'>Then said the old man, Why are ye so sad? I may well be heavy, said</a>
<a id='line_2210'>Arthur, for many things. Also here was a child, and told me many things</a>
<a id='line_2211'>that meseemeth he should not know, for he was not of age to know my</a>
<a id='line_2212'>father. Yes, said the old man, the child told you truth, and more would</a>
<a id='line_2213'>he have told you an ye would have suffered him. But ye have done a</a>
<a id='line_2214'>thing late that God is displeased with you, for ye have lain by your</a>
<a id='line_2215'>sister, and on her ye have gotten a child that shall destroy you and</a>
<a id='line_2216'>all the knights of your realm. What are ye, said Arthur, that tell me</a>
<a id='line_2217'>these tidings? I am Merlin, and I was he in the child’s likeness. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_2218'>said King Arthur, ye are a marvellous man, but I marvel much of thy</a>
<a id='line_2219'>words that I must die in battle. Marvel not, said Merlin, for it is</a>
<a id='line_2220'>God’s will your body to be punished for your foul deeds; but I may well</a>
<a id='line_2221'>be sorry, said Merlin, for I shall die a shameful death, to be put in</a>
<a id='line_2222'>the earth quick, and ye shall die a worshipful death. And as they</a>
<a id='line_2223'>talked this, came one with the king’s horse, and so the king mounted on</a>
<a id='line_2224'>his horse, and Merlin on another, and so rode unto Carlion. And anon</a>
<a id='line_2225'>the king asked Ector and Ulfius how he was begotten, and they told him</a>
<a id='line_2226'>Uther Pendragon was his father and Queen Igraine his mother. Then he</a>
<a id='line_2227'>said to Merlin, I will that my mother be sent for that I may speak with</a>
<a id='line_2228'>her; and if she say so herself then will I believe it. In all haste,</a>
<a id='line_2229'>the queen was sent for, and she came and brought with her Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_2230'>Fay, her daughter, that was as fair a lady as any might be, and the</a>
<a id='line_2231'>king welcomed Igraine in the best manner.</a>
<a id='line_2232'></a>
<a id='line_2233'></a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>CHAPTER XXI. How Ulfius impeached Queen Igraine, Arthur’s mother, of</a>
<a id='line_2236'>treason; and how a knight came and desired to have the death of his</a>
<a id='line_2237'>master revenged.</a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'>Right so came Ulfius, and said openly, that the king and all might hear</a>
<a id='line_2240'>that were feasted that day, Ye are the falsest lady of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_2241'>the most traitress unto the king’s person. Beware, said Arthur, what</a>
<a id='line_2242'>thou sayest; thou speakest a great word. I am well ware, said Ulfius,</a>
<a id='line_2243'>what I speak, and here is my glove to prove it upon any man that will</a>
<a id='line_2244'>say the contrary, that this Queen Igraine is causer of your great</a>
<a id='line_2245'>damage, and of your great war. For, an she would have uttered it in the</a>
<a id='line_2246'>life of King Uther Pendragon, of the birth of you, and how ye were</a>
<a id='line_2247'>begotten ye had never had the mortal wars that ye have had; for the</a>
<a id='line_2248'>most part of your barons of your realm knew never whose son ye were,</a>
<a id='line_2249'>nor of whom ye were begotten; and she that bare you of her body should</a>
<a id='line_2250'>have made it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours, and in</a>
<a id='line_2251'>like wise to all the realm, wherefore I prove her false to God and to</a>
<a id='line_2252'>you and to all your realm, and who will say the contrary I will prove</a>
<a id='line_2253'>it on his body.</a>
<a id='line_2254'></a>
<a id='line_2255'>Then spake Igraine and said, I am a woman and I may not fight, but</a>
<a id='line_2256'>rather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good man take my</a>
<a id='line_2257'>quarrel. More, she said, Merlin knoweth well, and ye Sir Ulfius, how</a>
<a id='line_2258'>King Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagil in the likeness of my</a>
<a id='line_2259'>lord, that was dead three hours to-fore, and thereby gat a child that</a>
<a id='line_2260'>night upon me. And after the thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and</a>
<a id='line_2261'>by his commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2262'>and nourished by him, and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not</a>
<a id='line_2263'>what is his name, for I knew him never yet. And there, Ulfius said to</a>
<a id='line_2264'>the queen, Merlin is more to blame than ye. Well I wot, said the queen,</a>
<a id='line_2265'>I bare a child by my lord King Uther, but I wot not where he is become.</a>
<a id='line_2266'>Then Merlin took the king by the hand, saying, This is your mother. And</a>
<a id='line_2267'>therewith Sir Ector bare witness how he nourished him by Uther’s</a>
<a id='line_2268'>commandment. And therewith King Arthur took his mother, Queen Igraine,</a>
<a id='line_2269'>in his arms and kissed her, and either wept upon other. And then the</a>
<a id='line_2270'>king let make a feast that lasted eight days.</a>
<a id='line_2271'></a>
<a id='line_2272'>Then on a day there came in the court a squire on horseback, leading a</a>
<a id='line_2273'>knight before him wounded to the death, and told him how there was a</a>
<a id='line_2274'>knight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by a well, and hath slain</a>
<a id='line_2275'>my master, a good knight, his name was Miles; wherefore I beseech you</a>
<a id='line_2276'>that my master may be buried, and that some knight may revenge my</a>
<a id='line_2277'>master’s death. Then the noise was great of that knight’s death in the</a>
<a id='line_2278'>court, and every man said his advice. Then came Griflet that was but a</a>
<a id='line_2279'>squire, and he was but young, of the age of the king Arthur, so he</a>
<a id='line_2280'>besought the king for all his service that he had done him to give the</a>
<a id='line_2281'>order of knighthood.</a>
<a id='line_2282'></a>
<a id='line_2283'></a>
<a id='line_2284'></a>
<a id='line_2285'>CHAPTER XXII. How Griflet was made knight, and jousted with a knight.</a>
<a id='line_2286'></a>
<a id='line_2287'>Thou art full young and tender of age, said Arthur, for to take so high</a>
<a id='line_2288'>an order on thee. Sir, said Griflet, I beseech you make me knight. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2289'>said Merlin, it were great pity to lose Griflet, for he will be a</a>
<a id='line_2290'>passing good man when he is of age, abiding with you the term of his</a>
<a id='line_2291'>life. And if he adventure his body with yonder knight at the fountain,</a>
<a id='line_2292'>it is in great peril if ever he come again, for he is one of the best</a>
<a id='line_2293'>knights of the world, and the strongest man of arms. Well, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2294'>So at the desire of Griflet the king made him knight. Now, said Arthur</a>
<a id='line_2295'>unto Sir Griflet, sith I have made you knight thou must give me a gift.</a>
<a id='line_2296'>What ye will, said Griflet. Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy</a>
<a id='line_2297'>body, when thou hast jousted with the knight at the fountain, whether</a>
<a id='line_2298'>it fall ye be on foot or on horseback, that right so ye shall come</a>
<a id='line_2299'>again unto me without making any more debate. I will promise you, said</a>
<a id='line_2300'>Griflet, as you desire. Then took Griflet his horse in great haste, and</a>
<a id='line_2301'>dressed his shield and took a spear in his hand, and so he rode a great</a>
<a id='line_2302'>wallop till he came to the fountain, and thereby he saw a rich</a>
<a id='line_2303'>pavilion, and thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse well saddled and</a>
<a id='line_2304'>bridled, and on a tree a shield of divers colours and a great spear.</a>
<a id='line_2305'>Then Griflet smote on the shield with the butt of his spear, that the</a>
<a id='line_2306'>shield fell down to the ground. With that the knight came out of the</a>
<a id='line_2307'>pavilion, and said, Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield? For I</a>
<a id='line_2308'>will joust with you, said Griflet. It is better ye do not, said the</a>
<a id='line_2309'>knight, for ye are but young, and late made knight, and your might is</a>
<a id='line_2310'>nothing to mine. As for that, said Griflet, I will joust with you. That</a>
<a id='line_2311'>is me loath, said the knight, but sith I must needs, I will dress me</a>
<a id='line_2312'>thereto. Of whence be ye? said the knight. Sir, I am of Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_2313'>So the two knights ran together that Griflet’s spear all to-shivered;</a>
<a id='line_2314'>and there withal he smote Griflet through the shield and the left side,</a>
<a id='line_2315'>and brake the spear that the truncheon stuck in his body, that horse</a>
<a id='line_2316'>and knight fell down.</a>
<a id='line_2317'></a>
<a id='line_2318'></a>
<a id='line_2319'></a>
<a id='line_2320'>CHAPTER XXIII. How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for</a>
<a id='line_2321'>this land of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.</a>
<a id='line_2322'></a>
<a id='line_2323'>When the knight saw him lie so on the ground, he alighted, and was</a>
<a id='line_2324'>passing heavy, for he weened he had slain him, and then he unlaced his</a>
<a id='line_2325'>helm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he set him on his</a>
<a id='line_2326'>horse, and so betook him to God, and said he had a mighty heart, and if</a>
<a id='line_2327'>he might live he would prove a passing good knight. And so Sir Griflet</a>
<a id='line_2328'>rode to the court, where great dole was made for him. But through good</a>
<a id='line_2329'>leeches he was healed and saved. Right so came into the court twelve</a>
<a id='line_2330'>knights, and were aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_2331'>they asked of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2332'>would destroy him and his land. Well, said King Arthur, ye are</a>
<a id='line_2333'>messengers, therefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye should die</a>
<a id='line_2334'>therefore. But this is mine answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor</a>
<a id='line_2335'>none will I hold him, but on a fair field I shall give him my truage</a>
<a id='line_2336'>that shall be with a sharp spear, or else with a sharp sword, and that</a>
<a id='line_2337'>shall not be long, by my father’s soul, Uther Pendragon. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_2338'>the messengers departed passingly wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for</a>
<a id='line_2339'>in evil time came they then; for the king was passingly wroth for the</a>
<a id='line_2340'>hurt of Sir Griflet. And so he commanded a privy man of his chamber</a>
<a id='line_2341'>that or it be day his best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto</a>
<a id='line_2342'>his person, be without the city or to-morrow day. Right so or to-morrow</a>
<a id='line_2343'>day he met with his man and his horse, and so mounted up and dressed</a>
<a id='line_2344'>his shield and took his spear, and bade his chamberlain tarry there</a>
<a id='line_2345'>till he came again. And so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and</a>
<a id='line_2346'>then was he ware of three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain</a>
<a id='line_2347'>him. Then the king rode unto them, and bade them: Flee, churls! then</a>
<a id='line_2348'>were they afeard when they saw a knight, and fled. O Merlin, said</a>
<a id='line_2349'>Arthur, here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been.</a>
<a id='line_2350'>Nay, said Merlin, not so, for I could save myself an I would; and thou</a>
<a id='line_2351'>art more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the deathward, an</a>
<a id='line_2352'>God be not thy friend.</a>
<a id='line_2353'></a>
<a id='line_2354'>So as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich</a>
<a id='line_2355'>pavilion there by it. Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight</a>
<a id='line_2356'>armed in a chair. Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause abidest thou</a>
<a id='line_2357'>here, that there may no knight ride this way but if he joust with thee?</a>
<a id='line_2358'>said the king. I rede thee leave that custom, said Arthur. This custom,</a>
<a id='line_2359'>said the knight, have I used and will use maugre who saith nay, and who</a>
<a id='line_2360'>is grieved with my custom let him amend it that will. I will amend it,</a>
<a id='line_2361'>said Arthur. I shall defend thee, said the knight. Anon he took his</a>
<a id='line_2362'>horse and dressed his shield and took a spear, and they met so hard</a>
<a id='line_2363'>either in other’s shields, that all to-shivered their spears. Therewith</a>
<a id='line_2364'>anon Arthur pulled out his sword. Nay, not so, said the knight; it is</a>
<a id='line_2365'>fairer, said the knight, that we twain run more together with sharp</a>
<a id='line_2366'>spears. I will well, said Arthur, an I had any more spears. I have</a>
<a id='line_2367'>enow, said the knight; so there came a squire and brought two good</a>
<a id='line_2368'>spears, and Arthur chose one and he another; so they spurred their</a>
<a id='line_2369'>horses and came together with all their mights, that either brake their</a>
<a id='line_2370'>spears to their hands. Then Arthur set hand on his sword. Nay, said the</a>
<a id='line_2371'>knight, ye shall do better, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met</a>
<a id='line_2372'>withal, and once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us</a>
<a id='line_2373'>joust once again. I assent me, said Arthur. Anon there were brought two</a>
<a id='line_2374'>great spears, and every knight gat a spear, and therewith they ran</a>
<a id='line_2375'>together that Arthur’s spear all to-shivered. But the other knight hit</a>
<a id='line_2376'>him so hard in midst of the shield, that horse and man fell to the</a>
<a id='line_2377'>earth, and therewith Arthur was eager, and pulled out his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_2378'>said, I will assay thee, sir knight, on foot, for I have lost the</a>
<a id='line_2379'>honour on horseback. I will be on horseback, said the knight. Then was</a>
<a id='line_2380'>Arthur wroth, and dressed his shield toward him with his sword drawn.</a>
<a id='line_2381'>When the knight saw that, he alighted, for him thought no worship to</a>
<a id='line_2382'>have a knight at such avail, he to be on horseback and he on foot, and</a>
<a id='line_2383'>so he alighted and dressed his shield unto Arthur. And there began a</a>
<a id='line_2384'>strong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with their swords</a>
<a id='line_2385'>that the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood they bled both,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>that all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood, and</a>
<a id='line_2387'>thus they fought long and rested them, and then they went to the battle</a>
<a id='line_2388'>again, and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the</a>
<a id='line_2389'>earth. So at the last they smote together that both their swords met</a>
<a id='line_2390'>even together. But the sword of the knight smote King Arthur’s sword in</a>
<a id='line_2391'>two pieces, wherefore he was heavy. Then said the knight unto Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2392'>Thou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2393'>but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die. As for</a>
<a id='line_2394'>death, said King Arthur, welcome be it when it cometh, but to yield me</a>
<a id='line_2395'>unto thee as recreant I had liefer die than to be so shamed. And</a>
<a id='line_2396'>therewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and took him by the middle</a>
<a id='line_2397'>and threw him down, and raced off his helm. When the knight felt that</a>
<a id='line_2398'>he was adread, for he was a passing big man of might, and anon he</a>
<a id='line_2399'>brought Arthur under him, and raced off his helm and would have smitten</a>
<a id='line_2400'>off his head.</a>

<a id='line_2405'>on King Pellinore and made him to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_2406'></a>
<a id='line_2407'>Therewithal came Merlin and said, Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou</a>
<a id='line_2408'>slay that knight thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that</a>
<a id='line_2409'>ever was realm: for this knight is a man of more worship than thou</a>
<a id='line_2410'>wotest of. Why, who is he? said the knight. It is King Arthur. Then</a>
<a id='line_2411'>would he have slain him for dread of his wrath, and heaved up his</a>
<a id='line_2412'>sword, and therewith Merlin cast an enchantment to the knight, that he</a>
<a id='line_2413'>fell to the earth in a great sleep. Then Merlin took up King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2414'>and rode forth on the knight’s horse. Alas! said Arthur, what hast thou</a>
<a id='line_2415'>done, Merlin? hast thou slain this good knight by thy crafts? There</a>
<a id='line_2416'>liveth not so worshipful a knight as he was; I had liefer than the</a>
<a id='line_2417'>stint of my land a year that he were alive. Care ye not, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2418'>for he is wholer than ye; for he is but asleep, and will awake within</a>
<a id='line_2419'>three hours. I told you, said Merlin, what a knight he was; here had ye</a>
<a id='line_2420'>been slain had I not been. Also there liveth not a bigger knight than</a>
<a id='line_2421'>he is one, and he shall hereafter do you right good service; and his</a>
<a id='line_2422'>name is Pellinore, and he shall have two sons that shall be passing</a>
<a id='line_2423'>good men; save one they shall have no fellow of prowess and of good</a>
<a id='line_2424'>living, and their names shall be Percivale of Wales and Lamerake of</a>
<a id='line_2425'>Wales, and he shall tell you the name of your own son, begotten of your</a>
<a id='line_2426'>sister, that shall be the destruction of all this realm.</a>

<a id='line_2430'>CHAPTER XXV. How Arthur by the mean of Merlin gat Excalibur his sword</a>
<a id='line_2431'>of the Lady of the Lake.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>Right so the king and he departed, and went unto an hermit that was a</a>
<a id='line_2434'>good man and a great leech. So the hermit searched all his wounds and</a>
<a id='line_2435'>gave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were</a>
<a id='line_2436'>his wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed. And</a>
<a id='line_2437'>as they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword. No force, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2438'>hereby is a sword that shall be yours, an I may. So they rode till they</a>
<a id='line_2439'>came to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst</a>
<a id='line_2440'>of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that</a>
<a id='line_2441'>held a fair sword in that hand. Lo! said Merlin, yonder is that sword</a>
<a id='line_2442'>that I spake of. With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake. What</a>
<a id='line_2443'>damosel is that? said Arthur. That is the Lady of the Lake, said</a>
<a id='line_2444'>Merlin; and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place</a>
<a id='line_2445'>as any on earth, and richly beseen; and this damosel will come to you</a>
<a id='line_2446'>anon, and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.</a>
<a id='line_2447'>Anon withal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him, and he her</a>
<a id='line_2448'>again. Damosel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm</a>
<a id='line_2449'>holdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have no sword. Sir</a>
<a id='line_2450'>Arthur, king, said the damosel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give</a>
<a id='line_2451'>me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it. By my faith, said</a>
<a id='line_2452'>Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask. Well! said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>go ye into yonder barge, and row yourself to the sword, and take it and</a>
<a id='line_2454'>the scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time. So</a>
<a id='line_2455'>Sir Arthur and Merlin alighted and tied their horses to two trees, and</a>
<a id='line_2456'>so they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the</a>
<a id='line_2457'>hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him,</a>
<a id='line_2458'>and the arm and the hand went under the water. And so [they] came unto</a>
<a id='line_2459'>the land and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What</a>
<a id='line_2460'>signifieth yonder pavilion? It is the knight’s pavilion, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2461'>that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore; but he is out, he is not</a>
<a id='line_2462'>there. He hath ado with a knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they</a>
<a id='line_2463'>have foughten together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he had</a>
<a id='line_2464'>been dead, and he hath chased him even to Carlion, and we shall meet</a>
<a id='line_2465'>with him anon in the highway. That is well said, said Arthur, now have</a>
<a id='line_2466'>I a sword, now will I wage battle with him, and be avenged on him. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2467'>you shall not so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and</a>
<a id='line_2468'>chasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also he</a>
<a id='line_2469'>will not be lightly matched of one knight living, and therefore it is</a>
<a id='line_2470'>my counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short</a>
<a id='line_2471'>time, and his sons after his days. Also ye shall see that day in short</a>
<a id='line_2472'>space, you shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I</a>
<a id='line_2473'>see him, I will do as ye advise, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2474'></a>
<a id='line_2475'>Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well. Whether</a>
<a id='line_2476'>liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard? Me liketh</a>
<a id='line_2477'>better the sword, said Arthur. Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the</a>
<a id='line_2478'>scabbard is worth ten of the swords, for whiles ye have the scabbard</a>
<a id='line_2479'>upon you, ye shall never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded;</a>
<a id='line_2480'>therefore keep well the scabbard always with you. So they rode unto</a>
<a id='line_2481'>Carlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had</a>
<a id='line_2482'>done such a craft, that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by</a>
<a id='line_2483'>without any words. I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not</a>
<a id='line_2484'>speak. Sir, said Merlin, he saw you not, for an he had seen you, ye had</a>
<a id='line_2485'>not lightly departed. So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights</a>
<a id='line_2486'>were passing glad. And when they heard of his adventures, they</a>
<a id='line_2487'>marvelled that he would jeopard his person so, alone. But all men of</a>
<a id='line_2488'>worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain, that would put</a>
<a id='line_2489'>his person in adventure as other poor knights did.</a>

<a id='line_2492'></a>
<a id='line_2493'>CHAPTER XXVI. How tidings came to Arthur that King Rience had overcome</a>
<a id='line_2494'>eleven kings, and how he desired Arthur’s beard to trim his mantle.</a>
<a id='line_2495'></a>
<a id='line_2496'>This meanwhile came a messenger from King Rience of North Wales, and</a>
<a id='line_2497'>king he was of all Ireland, and of many isles. And this was his</a>
<a id='line_2498'>message, greeting well King Arthur in this manner wise, saying that</a>
<a id='line_2499'>King Rience had discomfited and overcome eleven kings, and everych of</a>
<a id='line_2500'>them did him homage, and that was this, they gave him their beards</a>
<a id='line_2501'>clean flayed off, as much as there was; wherefore the messenger came</a>
<a id='line_2502'>for King Arthur’s beard. For King Rience had purfled a mantle with</a>
<a id='line_2503'>kings’ beards, and there lacked one place of the mantle; wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_2504'>sent for his beard, or else he would enter into his lands, and burn and</a>
<a id='line_2505'>slay, and never leave till he have the head and the beard. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_2506'>Arthur, thou hast said thy message, the which is the most villainous</a>
<a id='line_2507'>and lewdest message that ever man heard sent unto a king; also thou</a>
<a id='line_2508'>mayest see my beard is full young yet to make a purfle of it. But tell</a>
<a id='line_2509'>thou thy king this: I owe him none homage, nor none of mine elders; but</a>
<a id='line_2510'>or it be long to, he shall do me homage on both his knees, or else he</a>
<a id='line_2511'>shall lose his head, by the faith of my body, for this is the most</a>
<a id='line_2512'>shamefulest message that ever I heard speak of. I have espied thy king</a>
<a id='line_2513'>met never yet with worshipful man, but tell him, I will have his head</a>
<a id='line_2514'>without he do me homage. Then the messenger departed.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>Now is there any here, said Arthur, that knoweth King Rience? Then</a>
<a id='line_2517'>answered a knight that hight Naram, Sir, I know the king well; he is a</a>
<a id='line_2518'>passing good man of his body, as few be living, and a passing proud</a>
<a id='line_2519'>man, and Sir, doubt ye not he will make war on you with a mighty</a>
<a id='line_2520'>puissance. Well, said Arthur, I shall ordain for him in short time.</a>

<a id='line_2527'>Then King Arthur let send for all the children born on May-day,</a>
<a id='line_2528'>begotten of lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that</a>
<a id='line_2529'>he that should destroy him should be born on May-day, wherefore he sent</a>
<a id='line_2530'>for them all, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords’</a>
<a id='line_2531'>sons, and all were sent unto the king, and so was Mordred sent by King</a>
<a id='line_2532'>Lot’s wife, and all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four</a>
<a id='line_2533'>weeks old, and some less. And so by fortune the ship drave unto a</a>
<a id='line_2534'>castle, and was all to-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that</a>
<a id='line_2535'>Mordred was cast up, and a good man found him, and nourished him till</a>
<a id='line_2536'>he was fourteen year old, and then he brought him to the court, as it</a>
<a id='line_2537'>rehearseth afterward, toward the end of the Death of Arthur. So many</a>
<a id='line_2538'>lords and barons of this realm were displeased, for their children were</a>
<a id='line_2539'>so lost, and many put the wite on Merlin more than on Arthur; so what</a>
<a id='line_2540'>for dread and for love, they held their peace. But when the messenger</a>
<a id='line_2541'>came to King Rience, then was he wood out of measure, and purveyed him</a>

<a id='line_2554'>CHAPTER I. Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man</a>
<a id='line_2555'>of such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>After the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the which</a>
<a id='line_2558'>had great war in his days for to get all England into his hand. For</a>
<a id='line_2559'>there were many kings within the realm of England, and in Wales,</a>
<a id='line_2560'>Scotland, and Cornwall. So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at</a>
<a id='line_2561'>London, there came a knight and told the king tidings how that the King</a>
<a id='line_2562'>Rience of North Wales had reared a great number of people, and were</a>
<a id='line_2563'>entered into the land, and burnt and slew the king’s true liege people.</a>
<a id='line_2564'>If this be true, said Arthur, it were great shame unto mine estate but</a>
<a id='line_2565'>that he were mightily withstood. It is truth, said the knight, for I</a>
<a id='line_2566'>saw the host myself. Well, said the king, let make a cry, that all the</a>
<a id='line_2567'>lords, knights, and gentlemen of arms, should draw unto a castle called</a>
<a id='line_2568'>Camelot in those days, and there the king would let make a</a>
<a id='line_2569'>council-general and a great jousts.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>So when the king was come thither with all his baronage, and lodged as</a>
<a id='line_2572'>they seemed best, there was come a damosel the which was sent on</a>
<a id='line_2573'>message from the great lady Lile of Avelion. And when she came before</a>
<a id='line_2574'>King Arthur, she told from whom she came, and how she was sent on</a>
<a id='line_2575'>message unto him for these causes. Then she let her mantle fall that</a>
<a id='line_2576'>was richly furred; and then was she girt with a noble sword whereof the</a>
<a id='line_2577'>king had marvel, and said, Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with</a>
<a id='line_2578'>that sword? it beseemeth you not. Now shall I tell you, said the</a>
<a id='line_2579'>damosel; this sword that I am girt withal doth me great sorrow and</a>
<a id='line_2580'>cumbrance, for I may not be delivered of this sword but by a knight,</a>
<a id='line_2581'>but he must be a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds, and</a>
<a id='line_2582'>without villainy or treachery, and without treason. And if I may find</a>
<a id='line_2583'>such a knight that hath all these virtues, he may draw out this sword</a>
<a id='line_2584'>out of the sheath, for I have been at King Rience’s it was told me</a>
<a id='line_2585'>there were passing good knights, and he and all his knights have</a>
<a id='line_2586'>assayed it and none can speed. This is a great marvel, said Arthur, if</a>
<a id='line_2587'>this be sooth; I will myself assay to draw out the sword, not presuming</a>
<a id='line_2588'>upon myself that I am the best knight, but that I will begin to draw at</a>
<a id='line_2589'>your sword in giving example to all the barons that they shall assay</a>
<a id='line_2590'>everych one after other when I have assayed it. Then Arthur took the</a>
<a id='line_2591'>sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pulled at it eagerly, but the</a>
<a id='line_2592'>sword would not out.</a>
<a id='line_2593'></a>
<a id='line_2594'>Sir, said the damosel, you need not to pull half so hard, for he that</a>
<a id='line_2595'>shall pull it out shall do it with little might. Ye say well, said</a>
<a id='line_2596'>Arthur; now assay ye all my barons; but beware ye be not defiled with</a>
<a id='line_2597'>shame, treachery, nor guile. Then it will not avail, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_2598'>for he must be a clean knight without villainy, and of a gentle strain</a>
<a id='line_2599'>of father side and mother side. Most of all the barons of the Round</a>
<a id='line_2600'>Table that were there at that time assayed all by row, but there might</a>
<a id='line_2601'>none speed; wherefore the damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and</a>
<a id='line_2602'>said, Alas! I weened in this court had been the best knights without</a>
<a id='line_2603'>treachery or treason. By my faith, said Arthur, here are good knights,</a>
<a id='line_2604'>as I deem, as any be in the world, but their grace is not to help you,</a>
<a id='line_2605'>wherefore I am displeased.</a>

<a id='line_2613'>that had been prisoner with him half a year and more for slaying of a</a>
<a id='line_2614'>knight, the which was cousin unto King Arthur. The name of this knight</a>
<a id='line_2615'>was called Balin, and by good means of the barons he was delivered out</a>
<a id='line_2616'>of prison, for he was a good man named of his body, and he was born in</a>
<a id='line_2617'>Northumberland. And so he went privily into the court, and saw this</a>
<a id='line_2618'>adventure, whereof it raised his heart, and he would assay it as other</a>
<a id='line_2619'>knights did, but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far</a>
<a id='line_2620'>in press. But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his</a>
<a id='line_2621'>grace happed him, as any knight that there was. And as the damosel took</a>
<a id='line_2622'>her leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight</a>
<a id='line_2623'>Balin called unto her, and said, Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>suffer me as well to assay as these lords; though that I be so poorly</a>
<a id='line_2625'>clothed, in my heart meseemeth I am fully assured as some of these</a>
<a id='line_2626'>others, and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well. The damosel</a>
<a id='line_2627'>beheld the poor knight, and saw he was a likely man, but for his poor</a>
<a id='line_2628'>arrayment she thought he should be of no worship without villainy or</a>
<a id='line_2629'>treachery. And then she said unto the knight, Sir, it needeth not to</a>
<a id='line_2630'>put me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as</a>
<a id='line_2631'>other have failed. Ah! fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good</a>
<a id='line_2632'>tatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and</a>
<a id='line_2633'>worship is hid within man’s person, and many a worshipful knight is not</a>
<a id='line_2634'>known unto all people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in</a>
<a id='line_2635'>arrayment. By God, said the damosel, ye say sooth; therefore ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2636'>assay to do what ye may. Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and</a>
<a id='line_2637'>sheath, and drew it out easily; and when he looked on the sword it</a>
<a id='line_2638'>pleased him much. Then had the king and all the barons great marvel</a>
<a id='line_2639'>that Balin had done that adventure, and many knights had great despite</a>
<a id='line_2640'>of Balin. Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and</a>
<a id='line_2641'>the best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason,</a>
<a id='line_2642'>treachery, or villainy, and many marvels shall he do. Now, gentle and</a>
<a id='line_2643'>courteous knight, give me the sword again. Nay, said Balin, for this</a>
<a id='line_2644'>sword will I keep, but it be taken from me with force. Well, said the</a>
<a id='line_2645'>damosel, ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay</a>
<a id='line_2646'>with the sword the best friend that ye have, and the man that ye most</a>
<a id='line_2647'>love in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction. I shall</a>
<a id='line_2648'>take the adventure, said Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword</a>
<a id='line_2649'>ye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my body. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2650'>repent it within short time, said the damosel, for I would have the</a>
<a id='line_2651'>sword more for your avail than for mine, for I am passing heavy for</a>
<a id='line_2652'>your sake; for ye will not believe that sword shall be your</a>
<a id='line_2653'>destruction, and that is great pity. With that the damosel departed,</a>
<a id='line_2654'>making great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>Anon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would depart</a>
<a id='line_2657'>from the court, and took his leave of King Arthur. Nay, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_2658'>I suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship, I suppose</a>
<a id='line_2659'>ye are displeased that I have shewed you unkindness; blame me the less,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>for I was misinformed against you, but I weened ye had not been such a</a>
<a id='line_2661'>knight as ye are, of worship and prowess, and if ye will abide in this</a>
<a id='line_2662'>court among my fellowship, I shall so advance you as ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_2663'>pleased. God thank your highness, said Balin, your bounty and highness</a>
<a id='line_2664'>may no man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs</a>
<a id='line_2665'>depart, beseeching you alway of your good grace. Truly, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_2666'>I am right wroth for your departing; I pray you, fair knight, that ye</a>
<a id='line_2667'>tarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome to me, and to my barons,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>and I shall amend all miss that I have done against you; God thank your</a>
<a id='line_2669'>great lordship, said Balin, and therewith made him ready to depart.</a>
<a id='line_2670'>Then the most part of the knights of the Round Table said that Balin</a>
<a id='line_2671'>did not this adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.</a>

<a id='line_2674'></a>
<a id='line_2675'>CHAPTER III. How the Lady of the Lake demanded the knight’s head that</a>
<a id='line_2676'>had won the sword, or the maiden’s head.</a>
<a id='line_2677'></a>
<a id='line_2678'>The meanwhile, that this knight was making him ready to depart, there</a>
<a id='line_2679'>came into the court a lady that hight the Lady of the Lake. And she</a>
<a id='line_2680'>came on horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there</a>
<a id='line_2681'>asked him a gift that he promised her when she gave him the sword. That</a>
<a id='line_2682'>is sooth, said Arthur, a gift I promised you, but I have forgotten the</a>
<a id='line_2683'>name of my sword that ye gave me. The name of it, said the lady, is</a>
<a id='line_2684'>Excalibur, that is as much to say as Cut-steel. Ye say well, said the</a>
<a id='line_2685'>king; ask what ye will and ye shall have it, an it lie in my power to</a>
<a id='line_2686'>give it. Well, said the lady, I ask the head of the knight that hath</a>
<a id='line_2687'>won the sword, or else the damosel’s head that brought it; I take no</a>
<a id='line_2688'>force though I have both their heads, for he slew my brother, a good</a>
<a id='line_2689'>knight and a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father’s</a>
<a id='line_2690'>death. Truly, said King Arthur, I may not grant neither of their heads</a>
<a id='line_2691'>with my worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil</a>
<a id='line_2692'>your desire. I will ask none other thing, said the lady. When Balin was</a>
<a id='line_2693'>ready to depart, he saw the Lady of the Lake, that by her means had</a>
<a id='line_2694'>slain Balin’s mother, and he had sought her three years; and when it</a>
<a id='line_2695'>was told him that she asked his head of King Arthur, he went to her</a>
<a id='line_2696'>straight and said, Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and</a>
<a id='line_2697'>therefore ye shall lose yours, and with his sword lightly he smote off</a>
<a id='line_2698'>her head before King Arthur. Alas, for shame! said Arthur, why have ye</a>
<a id='line_2699'>done so? ye have shamed me and all my court, for this was a lady that I</a>
<a id='line_2700'>was beholden to, and hither she came under my safe-conduct; I shall</a>
<a id='line_2701'>never forgive you that trespass. Sir, said Balin, me forthinketh of</a>
<a id='line_2702'>your displeasure, for this same lady was the untruest lady living, and</a>
<a id='line_2703'>by enchantment and sorcery she hath been the destroyer of many good</a>
<a id='line_2704'>knights, and she was causer that my mother was burnt, through her</a>
<a id='line_2705'>falsehood and treachery. What cause soever ye had, said Arthur, ye</a>
<a id='line_2706'>should have forborne her in my presence; therefore, think not the</a>
<a id='line_2707'>contrary, ye shall repent it, for such another despite had I never in</a>
<a id='line_2708'>my court; therefore withdraw you out of my court in all haste ye may.</a>
<a id='line_2709'></a>
<a id='line_2710'>Then Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him to his</a>
<a id='line_2711'>hostelry, and there he met with his squire, that was sorry he had</a>
<a id='line_2712'>displeased King Arthur and so they rode forth out of the town. Now,</a>
<a id='line_2713'>said Balin, we must depart, take thou this head and bear it to my</a>
<a id='line_2714'>friends, and tell them how I have sped, and tell my friends in</a>
<a id='line_2715'>Northumberland that my most foe is dead. Also tell them how I am out of</a>
<a id='line_2716'>prison, and what adventure befell me at the getting of this sword.</a>
<a id='line_2717'>Alas! said the squire, ye are greatly to blame for to displease King</a>
<a id='line_2718'>Arthur. As for that, said Balin, I will hie me, in all the haste that I</a>
<a id='line_2719'>may, to meet with King Rience and destroy him, either else to die</a>
<a id='line_2720'>therefore; and if it may hap me to win him, then will King Arthur be my</a>
<a id='line_2721'>good and gracious lord. Where shall I meet with you? said the squire.</a>
<a id='line_2722'>In King Arthur’s court, said Balin. So his squire and he departed at</a>
<a id='line_2723'>that time. Then King Arthur and all the court made great dole and had</a>
<a id='line_2724'>shame of the death of the Lady of the Lake. Then the king buried her</a>
<a id='line_2725'>richly.</a>

<a id='line_2729'>CHAPTER IV. How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel.</a>
<a id='line_2730'></a>
<a id='line_2731'>At that time there was a knight, the which was the king’s son of</a>
<a id='line_2732'>Ireland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight,</a>
<a id='line_2733'>and counted himself one of the best of the court; and he had great</a>
<a id='line_2734'>despite at Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be</a>
<a id='line_2735'>accounted more hardy, or more of prowess; and he asked King Arthur if</a>
<a id='line_2736'>he would give him leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite</a>
<a id='line_2737'>that he had done. Do your best, said Arthur, I am right wroth with</a>
<a id='line_2738'>Balin; I would he were quit of the despite that he hath done to me and</a>
<a id='line_2739'>to my court. Then this Lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready.</a>
<a id='line_2740'>In the meanwhile came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there</a>
<a id='line_2741'>was told him the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of</a>
<a id='line_2742'>the Lake. Now shall I say you, said Merlin; this same damosel that here</a>
<a id='line_2743'>standeth, that brought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the</a>
<a id='line_2744'>cause of her coming: she was the falsest damosel that liveth. Say not</a>
<a id='line_2745'>so, said they. She hath a brother, a passing good knight of prowess and</a>
<a id='line_2746'>a full true man; and this damosel loved another knight that held her to</a>
<a id='line_2747'>paramour, and this good knight her brother met with the knight that</a>
<a id='line_2748'>held her to paramour, and slew him by force of his hands. When this</a>
<a id='line_2749'>false damosel understood this, she went to the Lady Lile of Avelion,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>and besought her of help, to be avenged on her own brother.</a>
<a id='line_2751'></a>
<a id='line_2752'></a>
<a id='line_2753'></a>
<a id='line_2754'>CHAPTER V. How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_2755'>how he jousted and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>And so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her this sword that she brought</a>
<a id='line_2758'>with her, and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if</a>
<a id='line_2759'>he be one of the best knights of this realm, and he should be hard and</a>
<a id='line_2760'>full of prowess, and with that sword he should slay her brother. This</a>
<a id='line_2761'>was the cause that the damosel came into this court. I know it as well</a>
<a id='line_2762'>as ye. Would God she had not come into this court, but she came never</a>
<a id='line_2763'>in fellowship of worship to do good, but always great harm; and that</a>
<a id='line_2764'>knight that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword,</a>
<a id='line_2765'>for the which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of</a>
<a id='line_2766'>more prowess than he is, and he shall do unto you, my Lord Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>great honour and kindness; and it is great pity he shall not endure but</a>
<a id='line_2768'>a while, for of his strength and hardiness I know not his match living.</a>
<a id='line_2769'></a>
<a id='line_2770'>So the knight of Ireland armed him at all points, and dressed his</a>
<a id='line_2771'>shield on his shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his spear</a>
<a id='line_2772'>in his hand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his horse might</a>
<a id='line_2773'>go; and within a little space on a mountain he had a sight of Balin,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>and with a loud voice he cried, Abide, knight, for ye shall abide</a>
<a id='line_2775'>whether ye will or nill, and the shield that is to-fore you shall not</a>
<a id='line_2776'>help. When Balin heard the noise, he turned his horse fiercely, and</a>
<a id='line_2777'>said, Fair knight, what will ye with me, will ye joust with me? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_2778'>said the Irish knight, therefore come I after you. Peradventure, said</a>
<a id='line_2779'>Balin, it had been better to have holden you at home, for many a man</a>
<a id='line_2780'>weeneth to put his enemy to a rebuke, and oft it falleth to himself. Of</a>
<a id='line_2781'>what court be ye sent from? said Balin. I am come from the court of</a>
<a id='line_2782'>King Arthur, said the knight of Ireland, that come hither for to</a>
<a id='line_2783'>revenge the despite ye did this day to King Arthur and to his court.</a>
<a id='line_2784'>Well, said Balin, I see well I must have ado with you, that me</a>
<a id='line_2785'>forthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of his court; and your</a>
<a id='line_2786'>quarrel is full simple, said Balin, unto me, for the lady that is dead,</a>
<a id='line_2787'>did me great damage, and else would I have been loath as any knight</a>
<a id='line_2788'>that liveth for to slay a lady. Make you ready, said the knight</a>
<a id='line_2789'>Lanceor, and dress you unto me, for that one shall abide in the field.</a>
<a id='line_2790'>Then they took their spears, and came together as much as their horses</a>
<a id='line_2791'>might drive, and the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that all</a>
<a id='line_2792'>went shivers off his spear, and Balin hit him through the shield, and</a>
<a id='line_2793'>the hauberk perished, and so pierced through his body and the horse’s</a>
<a id='line_2794'>croup, and anon turned his horse fiercely, and drew out his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_2795'>wist not that he had slain him; and then he saw him lie as a dead</a>
<a id='line_2796'>corpse.</a>

<a id='line_2799'></a>
<a id='line_2800'>CHAPTER VI. How a damosel, which was love to Lanceor, slew herself for</a>
<a id='line_2801'>love, and how Balin met with his brother Balan.</a>
<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>Then he looked by him, and was ware of a damosel that came riding full</a>
<a id='line_2804'>fast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey. And when she espied</a>
<a id='line_2805'>that Lanceor was slain, she made sorrow out of measure, and said, O</a>
<a id='line_2806'>Balin, two bodies thou hast slain and one heart, and two hearts in one</a>
<a id='line_2807'>body, and two souls thou hast lost. And therewith she took the sword</a>
<a id='line_2808'>from her love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon. And</a>
<a id='line_2809'>when she arose she made great dole out of measure, the which sorrow</a>
<a id='line_2810'>grieved Balin passingly sore, and he went unto her for to have taken</a>
<a id='line_2811'>the sword out of her hand, but she held it so fast he might not take it</a>
<a id='line_2812'>out of her hand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she set</a>
<a id='line_2813'>the pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body. When Balin</a>
<a id='line_2814'>espied her deeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and ashamed that</a>
<a id='line_2815'>so fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love of his death.</a>
<a id='line_2816'>Alas, said Balin, me repenteth sore the death of this knight, for the</a>
<a id='line_2817'>love of this damosel, for there was much true love betwixt them both,</a>
<a id='line_2818'>and for sorrow might not longer behold him, but turned his horse and</a>
<a id='line_2819'>looked toward a great forest, and there he was ware, by the arms, of</a>
<a id='line_2820'>his brother Balan. And when they were met they put off their helms and</a>
<a id='line_2821'>kissed together, and wept for joy and pity. Then Balan said, I little</a>
<a id='line_2822'>weened to have met with you at this sudden adventure; I am right glad</a>
<a id='line_2823'>of your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment, for a man told me,</a>
<a id='line_2824'>in the castle of Four Stones, that ye were delivered, and that man had</a>
<a id='line_2825'>seen you in the court of King Arthur, and therefore I came hither into</a>
<a id='line_2826'>this country, for here I supposed to find you. Anon the knight Balin</a>
<a id='line_2827'>told his brother of his adventure of the sword, and of the death of the</a>
<a id='line_2828'>Lady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was displeased with him.</a>
<a id='line_2829'>Wherefore he sent this knight after me, that lieth here dead, and the</a>
<a id='line_2830'>death of this damosel grieveth me sore. So doth it me, said Balan, but</a>
<a id='line_2831'>ye must take the adventure that God will ordain you. Truly, said Balin,</a>
<a id='line_2832'>I am right heavy that my Lord Arthur is displeased with me, for he is</a>
<a id='line_2833'>the most worshipful knight that reigneth now on earth, and his love</a>
<a id='line_2834'>will I get or else will I put my life in adventure. For the King Rience</a>
<a id='line_2835'>lieth at a siege at the Castle Terrabil, and thither will we draw in</a>
<a id='line_2836'>all haste, to prove our worship and prowess upon him. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_2837'>Balan, that we do, and we will help each other as brethren ought to do.</a>

<a id='line_2842'>how King Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.</a>
<a id='line_2843'></a>
<a id='line_2844'>Now go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met. The meanwhile as they</a>
<a id='line_2845'>talked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on horseback, as</a>
<a id='line_2846'>much as he might; and found the dead bodies, wherefore he made great</a>
<a id='line_2847'>dole, and pulled out his hair for sorrow, and said, Which of you</a>
<a id='line_2848'>knights have done this deed? Whereby askest thou it? said Balan. For I</a>
<a id='line_2849'>would wit it, said the dwarf. It was I, said Balin, that slew this</a>
<a id='line_2850'>knight in my defence, for hither he came to chase me, and either I must</a>
<a id='line_2851'>slay him or he me; and this damosel slew herself for his love, which</a>
<a id='line_2852'>repenteth me, and for her sake I shall owe all women the better love.</a>
<a id='line_2853'>Alas, said the dwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for</a>
<a id='line_2854'>this knight that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men that</a>
<a id='line_2855'>lived, and trust well, Balin, the kin of this knight will chase you</a>
<a id='line_2856'>through the world till they have slain you. As for that, said Balin, I</a>
<a id='line_2857'>fear not greatly, but I am right heavy that I have displeased my lord</a>
<a id='line_2858'>King Arthur, for the death of this knight. So as they talked together,</a>
<a id='line_2859'>there came a king of Cornwall riding, the which hight King Mark. And</a>
<a id='line_2860'>when he saw these two bodies dead, and understood how they were dead,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>by the two knights above said, then made the king great sorrow for the</a>
<a id='line_2862'>true love that was betwixt them, and said, I will not depart till I</a>
<a id='line_2863'>have on this earth made a tomb, and there he pight his pavilions and</a>
<a id='line_2864'>sought through all the country to find a tomb, and in a church they</a>
<a id='line_2865'>found one was fair and rich, and then the king let put them both in the</a>
<a id='line_2866'>earth, and put the tomb upon them, and wrote the names of them both on</a>
<a id='line_2867'>the tomb. How here lieth Lanceor the king’s son of Ireland, that at his</a>
<a id='line_2868'>own request was slain by the hands of Balin; and how his lady, Colombe,</a>
<a id='line_2869'>and paramour, slew herself with her love’s sword for dole and sorrow.</a>

<a id='line_2880'>wrote their names upon the tomb with letters of gold that should fight</a>
<a id='line_2881'>in that place, whose names were Launcelot de Lake, and Tristram. Thou</a>
<a id='line_2882'>art a marvellous man, said King Mark unto Merlin, that speakest of such</a>
<a id='line_2883'>marvels, thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds.</a>
<a id='line_2884'>What is thy name? said King Mark. At this time, said Merlin, I will not</a>
<a id='line_2885'>tell, but at that time when Sir Tristram is taken with his sovereign</a>
<a id='line_2886'>lady, then ye shall hear and know my name, and at that time ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2887'>hear tidings that shall not please you. Then said Merlin to Balin, Thou</a>
<a id='line_2888'>hast done thyself great hurt, because that thou savest not this lady</a>
<a id='line_2889'>that slew herself, that might have saved her an thou wouldest. By the</a>
<a id='line_2890'>faith of my body, said Balin, I might not save her, for she slew</a>
<a id='line_2891'>herself suddenly. Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of</a>
<a id='line_2892'>that lady thou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man</a>
<a id='line_2893'>struck, except the stroke of our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest</a>
<a id='line_2894'>knight and the man of most worship that now liveth, and through that</a>
<a id='line_2895'>stroke three kingdoms shall be in great poverty, misery and</a>
<a id='line_2896'>wretchedness twelve years, and the knight shall not be whole of that</a>
<a id='line_2897'>wound for many years. Then Merlin took his leave of Balin. And Balin</a>
<a id='line_2898'>said, If I wist it were sooth that ye say I should do such a perilous</a>
<a id='line_2899'>deed as that, I would slay myself to make thee a liar. Therewith Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2900'>vanished away suddenly. And then Balan and his brother took their leave</a>
<a id='line_2901'>of King Mark. First, said the king, tell me your name. Sir, said Balan,</a>
<a id='line_2902'>ye may see he beareth two swords, thereby ye may call him the Knight</a>
<a id='line_2903'>with the Two Swords. And so departed King Mark unto Camelot to King</a>
<a id='line_2904'>Arthur, and Balin took the way toward King Rience; and as they rode</a>
<a id='line_2905'>together they met with Merlin disguised, but they knew him not. Whither</a>
<a id='line_2906'>ride you? said Merlin. We have little to do, said the two knights, to</a>
<a id='line_2907'>tell thee. But what is thy name? said Balin. At this time, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>I will not tell it thee. It is evil seen, said the knights, that thou</a>
<a id='line_2909'>art a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_2910'>Merlin, be it as it be may, I can tell you wherefore ye ride this way,</a>
<a id='line_2911'>for to meet King Rience; but it will not avail you without ye have my</a>
<a id='line_2912'>counsel. Ah! said Balin, ye are Merlin; we will be ruled by your</a>
<a id='line_2913'>counsel. Come on, said Merlin, ye shall have great worship, and look</a>
<a id='line_2914'>that ye do knightly, for ye shall have great need. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_2915'>Balin, dread you not, we will do what we may.</a>
<a id='line_2916'></a>
<a id='line_2917'></a>
<a id='line_2918'></a>
<a id='line_2919'>CHAPTER IX. How Balin and his brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took</a>
<a id='line_2920'>King Rience and brought him to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2921'></a>
<a id='line_2922'>Then Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the highway, and</a>
<a id='line_2923'>took off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid</a>
<a id='line_2924'>them down to rest them till it was nigh midnight. Then Merlin bade them</a>
<a id='line_2925'>rise, and make them ready, for the king was nigh them, that was stolen</a>
<a id='line_2926'>away from his host with a three score horses of his best knights, and</a>
<a id='line_2927'>twenty of them rode to-fore to warn the Lady de Vance that the king was</a>
<a id='line_2928'>coming; for that night King Rience should have lain with her. Which is</a>
<a id='line_2929'>the king? said Balin. Abide, said Merlin, here in a strait way ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2930'>meet with him; and therewith he showed Balin and his brother where he</a>
<a id='line_2931'>rode.</a>
<a id='line_2932'></a>
<a id='line_2933'>Anon Balin and his brother met with the king, and smote him down, and</a>
<a id='line_2934'>wounded him fiercely, and laid him to the ground; and there they slew</a>
<a id='line_2935'>on the right hand and the left hand, and slew more than forty of his</a>
<a id='line_2936'>men, and the remnant fled. Then went they again to King Rience and</a>
<a id='line_2937'>would have slain him had he not yielded him unto their grace. Then said</a>
<a id='line_2938'>he thus: Knights full of prowess, slay me not, for by my life ye may</a>
<a id='line_2939'>win, and by my death ye shall win nothing. Then said these two knights,</a>
<a id='line_2940'>Ye say sooth and truth, and so laid him on a horse-litter. With that</a>
<a id='line_2941'>Merlin was vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and told him</a>
<a id='line_2942'>how his most enemy was taken and discomfited. By whom? said King</a>
<a id='line_2943'>Arthur. By two knights, said Merlin, that would please your lordship,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>and to-morrow ye shall know what knights they are. Anon after came the</a>
<a id='line_2945'>Knight with the Two Swords and Balan his brother, and brought with them</a>
<a id='line_2946'>King Rience of North Wales, and there delivered him to the porters, and</a>
<a id='line_2947'>charged them with him; and so they two returned again in the dawning of</a>
<a id='line_2948'>the day. King Arthur came then to King Rience, and said, Sir king, ye</a>
<a id='line_2949'>are welcome: by what adventure come ye hither? Sir, said King Rience, I</a>
<a id='line_2950'>came hither by an hard adventure. Who won you? said King Arthur. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_2951'>said the king, the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which</a>
<a id='line_2952'>are two marvellous knights of prowess. I know them not, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2953'>but much I am beholden to them. Ah, said Merlin, I shall tell you: it</a>
<a id='line_2954'>is Balin that achieved the sword, and his brother Balan, a good knight,</a>
<a id='line_2955'>there liveth not a better of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be</a>
<a id='line_2956'>the greatest dole of him that ever I knew of knight, for he shall not</a>
<a id='line_2957'>long endure. Alas, said King Arthur, that is great pity; for I am much</a>
<a id='line_2958'>beholden unto him, and I have ill deserved it unto him for his</a>
<a id='line_2959'>kindness. Nay, said Merlin, he shall do much more for you, and that</a>
<a id='line_2960'>shall ye know in haste. But, sir, are ye purveyed, said Merlin, for</a>
<a id='line_2961'>to-morn the host of Nero, King Rience’s brother, will set on you or</a>
<a id='line_2962'>noon with a great host, and therefore make you ready, for I will depart</a>
<a id='line_2963'>from you.</a>
<a id='line_2964'></a>
<a id='line_2965'></a>
<a id='line_2966'></a>
<a id='line_2967'>CHAPTER X. How King Arthur had a battle against Nero and King Lot of</a>
<a id='line_2968'>Orkney, and how King Lot was deceived by Merlin, and how twelve kings</a>
<a id='line_2969'>were slain.</a>
<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>Then King Arthur made ready his host in ten battles and Nero was ready</a>
<a id='line_2972'>in the field afore the Castle Terrabil with a great host, and he had</a>
<a id='line_2973'>ten battles, with many more people than Arthur had. Then Nero had the</a>
<a id='line_2974'>vanguard with the most part of his people, and Merlin came to King Lot</a>
<a id='line_2975'>of the Isle of Orkney, and held him with a tale of prophecy, till Nero</a>
<a id='line_2976'>and his people were destroyed. And there Sir Kay the seneschal did</a>
<a id='line_2977'>passingly well, that the days of his life the worship went never from</a>
<a id='line_2978'>him; and Sir Hervis de Revel did marvellous deeds with King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_2979'>King Arthur slew that day twenty knights and maimed forty. At that time</a>
<a id='line_2980'>came in the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan, but they</a>
<a id='line_2981'>two did so marvellously that the king and all the knights marvelled of</a>
<a id='line_2982'>them, and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as</a>
<a id='line_2983'>angels, or devils from hell; and King Arthur said himself they were the</a>
<a id='line_2984'>best knights that ever he saw, for they gave such strokes that all men</a>
<a id='line_2985'>had wonder of them.</a>
<a id='line_2986'></a>
<a id='line_2987'>In the meanwhile came one to King Lot, and told him while he tarried</a>
<a id='line_2988'>there Nero was destroyed and slain with all his people. Alas, said King</a>
<a id='line_2989'>Lot, I am ashamed, for by my default there is many a worshipful man</a>
<a id='line_2990'>slain, for an we had been together there had been none host under the</a>
<a id='line_2991'>heaven that had been able for to have matched with us; this faiter with</a>
<a id='line_2992'>his prophecy hath mocked me. All that did Merlin, for he knew well that</a>
<a id='line_2993'>an King Lot had been with his body there at the first battle, King</a>
<a id='line_2994'>Arthur had been slain, and all his people destroyed; and well Merlin</a>
<a id='line_2995'>knew that one of the kings should be dead that day, and loath was</a>
<a id='line_2996'>Merlin that any of them both should be slain; but of the twain, he had</a>
<a id='line_2997'>liefer King Lot had been slain than King Arthur. Now what is best to</a>
<a id='line_2998'>do? said King Lot of Orkney; whether is me better to treat with King</a>
<a id='line_2999'>Arthur or to fight, for the greater part of our people are slain and</a>
<a id='line_3000'>destroyed? Sir, said a knight, set on Arthur for they are weary and</a>
<a id='line_3001'>forfoughten and we be fresh. As for me, said King Lot, I would every</a>
<a id='line_3002'>knight would do his part as I would do mine. And then they advanced</a>
<a id='line_3003'>banners and smote together and all to-shivered their spears; and</a>
<a id='line_3004'>Arthur’s knights, with the help of the Knight with the Two Swords and</a>
<a id='line_3005'>his brother Balan put King Lot and his host to the worse. But always</a>
<a id='line_3006'>King Lot held him in the foremost front, and did marvellous deeds of</a>
<a id='line_3007'>arms, for all his host was borne up by his hands, for he abode all</a>
<a id='line_3008'>knights. Alas he might not endure, the which was great pity, that so</a>
<a id='line_3009'>worthy a knight as he was one should be overmatched, that of late time</a>
<a id='line_3010'>afore had been a knight of King Arthur’s, and wedded the sister of King</a>
<a id='line_3011'>Arthur; and for King Arthur lay by King Lot’s wife, the which was</a>
<a id='line_3012'>Arthur’s sister, and gat on her Mordred, therefore King Lot held</a>
<a id='line_3013'>against Arthur. So there was a knight that was called the Knight with</a>
<a id='line_3014'>the Strange Beast, and at that time his right name was called</a>
<a id='line_3015'>Pellinore, the which was a good man of prowess, and he smote a mighty</a>
<a id='line_3016'>stroke at King Lot as he fought with all his enemies, and he failed of</a>
<a id='line_3017'>his stroke, and smote the horse’s neck, that he fell to the ground with</a>
<a id='line_3018'>King Lot. And therewith anon Pellinore smote him a great stroke through</a>
<a id='line_3019'>the helm and head unto the brows. And then all the host of Orkney fled</a>
<a id='line_3020'>for the death of King Lot, and there were slain many mothers’ sons. But</a>
<a id='line_3021'>King Pellinore bare the wite of the death of King Lot, wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_3022'>Gawaine revenged the death of his father the tenth year after he was</a>
<a id='line_3023'>made knight, and slew King Pellinore with his own hands. Also there</a>
<a id='line_3024'>were slain at that battle twelve kings on the side of King Lot with</a>
<a id='line_3025'>Nero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint Stephen’s in Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_3026'>and the remnant of knights and of others were buried in a great rock.</a>
<a id='line_3027'></a>
<a id='line_3028'></a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>CHAPTER XI. Of the interment of twelve kings, and of the prophecy of</a>
<a id='line_3031'>Merlin, and how Balin should give the dolorous stroke.</a>
<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>So at the interment came King Lot’s wife Margawse with her four sons,</a>
<a id='line_3034'>Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth. Also there came thither King</a>
<a id='line_3035'>Uriens, Sir Ewaine’s father, and Morgan le Fay his wife that was King</a>
<a id='line_3036'>Arthur’s sister. All these came to the interment. But of all these</a>
<a id='line_3037'>twelve kings King Arthur let make the tomb of King Lot passing richly,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>and made his tomb by his own; and then Arthur let make twelve images of</a>
<a id='line_3039'>latten and copper, and over-gilt it with gold, in the sign of twelve</a>
<a id='line_3040'>kings, and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt day and</a>
<a id='line_3041'>night; and King Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing above them</a>
<a id='line_3042'>with a sword drawn in his hand, and all the twelve figures had</a>
<a id='line_3043'>countenance like unto men that were overcome. All this made Merlin by</a>
<a id='line_3044'>his subtle craft, and there he told the king, When I am dead these</a>
<a id='line_3045'>tapers shall burn no longer, and soon after the adventures of the</a>
<a id='line_3046'>Sangreal shall come among you and be achieved. Also he told Arthur how</a>
<a id='line_3047'>Balin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke, whereof</a>
<a id='line_3048'>shall fall great vengeance. Oh, where is Balin and Balan and Pellinore?</a>
<a id='line_3049'>said King Arthur. As for Pellinore, said Merlin, he will meet with you</a>
<a id='line_3050'>soon; and as for Balin he will not be long from you; but the other</a>
<a id='line_3051'>brother will depart, ye shall see him no more. By my faith, said</a>
<a id='line_3052'>Arthur, they are two marvellous knights, and namely Balin passeth of</a>
<a id='line_3053'>prowess of any knight that ever I found, for much beholden am I unto</a>
<a id='line_3054'>him; would God he would abide with me. Sir, said Merlin, look ye keep</a>
<a id='line_3055'>well the scabbard of Excalibur, for ye shall lose no blood while ye</a>
<a id='line_3056'>have the scabbard upon you, though ye have as many wounds upon you as</a>
<a id='line_3057'>ye may have. So after, for great trust, Arthur betook the scabbard to</a>
<a id='line_3058'>Morgan le Fay his sister, and she loved another knight better than her</a>
<a id='line_3059'>husband King Uriens or King Arthur, and she would have had Arthur her</a>
<a id='line_3060'>brother slain, and therefore she let make another scabbard like it by</a>
<a id='line_3061'>enchantment, and gave the scabbard Excalibur to her love; and the</a>
<a id='line_3062'>knight’s name was called Accolon, that after had near slain King</a>
<a id='line_3063'>Arthur. After this Merlin told unto King Arthur of the prophecy that</a>
<a id='line_3064'>there should be a great battle beside Salisbury, and Mordred his own</a>
<a id='line_3065'>son should be against him. Also he told him that Bagdemegus was his</a>
<a id='line_3066'>cousin, and germain unto King Uriens.</a>
<a id='line_3067'></a>
<a id='line_3068'></a>
<a id='line_3069'></a>
<a id='line_3070'>CHAPTER XII. How a sorrowful knight came before Arthur, and how Balin</a>
<a id='line_3071'>fetched him, and how that knight was slain by a knight invisible.</a>
<a id='line_3072'></a>
<a id='line_3073'>Within a day or two King Arthur was somewhat sick, and he let pitch his</a>
<a id='line_3074'>pavilion in a meadow, and there he laid him down on a pallet to sleep,</a>
<a id='line_3075'>but he might have no rest. Right so he heard a great noise of an horse,</a>
<a id='line_3076'>and therewith the king looked out at the porch of the pavilion, and saw</a>
<a id='line_3077'>a knight coming even by him, making great dole. Abide, fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_3078'>Arthur, and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow. Ye may little</a>
<a id='line_3079'>amend me, said the knight, and so passed forth to the castle of Meliot.</a>
<a id='line_3080'>Anon after there came Balin, and when he saw King Arthur he alighted</a>
<a id='line_3081'>off his horse, and came to the King on foot, and saluted him. By my</a>
<a id='line_3082'>head, said Arthur, ye be welcome. Sir, right now came riding this way a</a>
<a id='line_3083'>knight making great mourn, for what cause I cannot tell; wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_3084'>would desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch</a>
<a id='line_3085'>again that knight either by force or else by his good will. I will do</a>
<a id='line_3086'>more for your lordship than that, said Balin; and so he rode more than</a>
<a id='line_3087'>a pace, and found the knight with a damosel in a forest, and said, Sir</a>
<a id='line_3088'>knight, ye must come with me unto King Arthur, for to tell him of your</a>
<a id='line_3089'>sorrow. That will I not, said the knight, for it will scathe me</a>
<a id='line_3090'>greatly, and do you none avail. Sir, said Balin, I pray you make you</a>
<a id='line_3091'>ready, for ye must go with me, or else I must fight with you and bring</a>
<a id='line_3092'>you by force, and that were me loath to do. Will ye be my warrant, said</a>
<a id='line_3093'>the knight, an I go with you? Yea, said Balin, or else I will die</a>
<a id='line_3094'>therefore. And so he made him ready to go with Balin, and left the</a>
<a id='line_3095'>damosel still. And as they were even afore King Arthur’s pavilion,</a>
<a id='line_3096'>there came one invisible, and smote this knight that went with Balin</a>
<a id='line_3097'>throughout the body with a spear. Alas, said the knight, I am slain</a>
<a id='line_3098'>under your conduct with a knight called Garlon; therefore take my horse</a>
<a id='line_3099'>that is better than yours, and ride to the damosel, and follow the</a>
<a id='line_3100'>quest that I was in as she will lead you, and revenge my death when ye</a>
<a id='line_3101'>may. That shall I do, said Balin, and that I make vow unto knighthood;</a>
<a id='line_3102'>and so he departed from this knight with great sorrow. So King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3103'>let bury this knight richly, and made a mention on his tomb, how there</a>
<a id='line_3104'>was slain Herlews le Berbeus, and by whom the treachery was done, the</a>
<a id='line_3105'>knight Garlon. But ever the damosel bare the truncheon of the spear</a>
<a id='line_3106'>with her that Sir Herlews was slain withal.</a>
<a id='line_3107'></a>
<a id='line_3108'></a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>CHAPTER XIII. How Balin and the damosel met with a knight which was in</a>
<a id='line_3111'>likewise slain, and how the damosel bled for the custom of a castle.</a>
<a id='line_3112'></a>
<a id='line_3113'>So Balin and the damosel rode into a forest, and there met with a</a>
<a id='line_3114'>knight that had been a-hunting, and that knight asked Balin for what</a>
<a id='line_3115'>cause he made so great sorrow. Me list not to tell you, said Balin.</a>
<a id='line_3116'>Now, said the knight, an I were armed as ye be I would fight with you.</a>
<a id='line_3117'>That should little need, said Balin, I am not afeard to tell you, and</a>
<a id='line_3118'>told him all the cause how it was. Ah, said the knight, is this all?</a>
<a id='line_3119'>here I ensure you by the faith of my body never to depart from you</a>
<a id='line_3120'>while my life lasteth. And so they went to the hostelry and armed them,</a>
<a id='line_3121'>and so rode forth with Balin. And as they came by an hermitage even by</a>
<a id='line_3122'>a churchyard, there came the knight Garlon invisible, and smote this</a>
<a id='line_3123'>knight, Perin de Mountbeliard, through the body with a spear. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>said the knight, I am slain by this traitor knight that rideth</a>
<a id='line_3125'>invisible. Alas, said Balin, it is not the first despite he hath done</a>
<a id='line_3126'>me; and there the hermit and Balin buried the knight under a rich stone</a>
<a id='line_3127'>and a tomb royal. And on the morn they found letters of gold written,</a>
<a id='line_3128'>how Sir Gawaine shall revenge his father’s death, King Lot, on the King</a>
<a id='line_3129'>Pellinore. Anon after this Balin and the damosel rode till they came to</a>
<a id='line_3130'>a castle, and there Balin alighted, and he and the damosel went to go</a>
<a id='line_3131'>into the castle, and anon as Balin came within the castle’s gate the</a>
<a id='line_3132'>portcullis fell down at his back, and there fell many men about the</a>
<a id='line_3133'>damosel, and would have slain her. When Balin saw that, he was sore</a>
<a id='line_3134'>aggrieved, for he might not help the damosel. Then he went up into the</a>
<a id='line_3135'>tower, and leapt over walls into the ditch, and hurt him not; and anon</a>
<a id='line_3136'>he pulled out his sword and would have foughten with them. And they all</a>
<a id='line_3137'>said nay, they would not fight with him, for they did nothing but the</a>
<a id='line_3138'>old custom of the castle; and told him how their lady was sick, and had</a>
<a id='line_3139'>lain many years, and she might not be whole but if she had a dish of</a>
<a id='line_3140'>silver full of blood of a clean maid and a king’s daughter; and</a>
<a id='line_3141'>therefore the custom of this castle is, there shall no damosel pass</a>
<a id='line_3142'>this way but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full. Well,</a>
<a id='line_3143'>said Balin, she shall bleed as much as she may bleed, but I will not</a>
<a id='line_3144'>lose the life of her whiles my life lasteth. And so Balin made her to</a>
<a id='line_3145'>bleed by her good will, but her blood helped not the lady. And so he</a>
<a id='line_3146'>and she rested there all night, and had there right good cheer, and on</a>
<a id='line_3147'>the morn they passed on their ways. And as it telleth after in the</a>
<a id='line_3148'>Sangreal, that Sir Percivale’s sister helped that lady with her blood,</a>
<a id='line_3149'>whereof she was dead.</a>
<a id='line_3150'></a>
<a id='line_3151'></a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>CHAPTER XIV. How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast,</a>
<a id='line_3154'>and there he slew him, to have his blood to heal therewith the son of</a>
<a id='line_3155'>his host.</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>
<a id='line_3157'>Then they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and by</a>
<a id='line_3158'>hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at</a>
<a id='line_3159'>ease. And as they sat at their supper Balin overheard one complain</a>
<a id='line_3160'>grievously by him in a chair. What is this noise? said Balin. Forsooth,</a>
<a id='line_3161'>said his host, I will tell you. I was but late at a jousting, and there</a>
<a id='line_3162'>I jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice</a>
<a id='line_3163'>smote I him down, and then he promised to quit me on my best friend;</a>
<a id='line_3164'>and so he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that</a>
<a id='line_3165'>knight’s blood, and he rideth alway invisible; but I know not his name.</a>
<a id='line_3166'>Ah! said Balin, I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he hath slain</a>
<a id='line_3167'>two knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I had liefer meet</a>
<a id='line_3168'>with that knight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he</a>
<a id='line_3169'>hath done me. Well, said his host, I shall tell you, King Pellam of</a>
<a id='line_3170'>Listeneise hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that</a>
<a id='line_3171'>shall be within these twenty days, and no knight may come there but if</a>
<a id='line_3172'>he bring his wife with him, or his paramour; and that knight, your</a>
<a id='line_3173'>enemy and mine, ye shall see that day. Then I behote you, said Balin,</a>
<a id='line_3174'>part of his blood to heal your son withal. We will be forward to-morn,</a>
<a id='line_3175'>said his host. So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and</a>
<a id='line_3176'>they had fifteen days’ journey or they came thither; and that same day</a>
<a id='line_3177'>began the great feast. And so they alighted and stabled their horses,</a>
<a id='line_3178'>and went into the castle; but Balin’s host might not be let in because</a>
<a id='line_3179'>he had no lady. Then Balin was well received and brought unto a chamber</a>
<a id='line_3180'>and unarmed him; and there were brought him robes to his pleasure, and</a>
<a id='line_3181'>would have had Balin leave his sword behind him. Nay, said Balin, that</a>
<a id='line_3182'>do I not, for it is the custom of my country a knight always to keep</a>
<a id='line_3183'>his weapon with him, and that custom will I keep, or else I will depart</a>
<a id='line_3184'>as I came. Then they gave him leave to wear his sword, and so he went</a>
<a id='line_3185'>unto the castle, and was set among knights of worship, and his lady</a>
<a id='line_3186'>afore him.</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
<a id='line_3188'>Soon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court whose</a>
<a id='line_3189'>name is Garlon? Yonder he goeth, said a knight, he with the black face;</a>
<a id='line_3190'>he is the marvellest knight that is now living, for he destroyeth many</a>
<a id='line_3191'>good knights, for he goeth invisible. Ah well, said Balin, is that he?</a>
<a id='line_3192'>Then Balin advised him long: If I slay him here I shall not escape, and</a>
<a id='line_3193'>if I leave him now, peradventure I shall never meet with him again at</a>
<a id='line_3194'>such a steven, and much harm he will do an he live. Therewith this</a>
<a id='line_3195'>Garlon espied that this Balin beheld him, and then he came and smote</a>
<a id='line_3196'>Balin on the face with the back of his hand, and said, Knight, why</a>
<a id='line_3197'>beholdest me so? for shame therefore, eat thy meat and do that thou</a>
<a id='line_3198'>came for. Thou sayest sooth, said Balin, this is not the first despite</a>
<a id='line_3199'>that thou hast done me, and therefore I will do what I came for, and</a>
<a id='line_3200'>rose up fiercely and clave his head to the shoulders. Give me the</a>
<a id='line_3201'>truncheon, said Balin to his lady, wherewith he slew your knight. Anon</a>
<a id='line_3202'>she gave it him, for alway she bare the truncheon with her. And</a>
<a id='line_3203'>therewith Balin smote him through the body, and said openly, With that</a>
<a id='line_3204'>truncheon thou hast slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy</a>
<a id='line_3205'>body. And then Balin called unto him his host, saying, Now may ye fetch</a>
<a id='line_3206'>blood enough to heal your son withal.</a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'></a>
<a id='line_3210'>CHAPTER XV. How Balin fought with King Pellam, and how his sword brake,</a>
<a id='line_3211'>and how he gat a spear wherewith he smote the dolorous stroke.</a>
<a id='line_3212'></a>
<a id='line_3213'>Anon all the knights arose from the table for to set on Balin, and King</a>
<a id='line_3214'>Pellam himself arose up fiercely, and said, Knight, hast thou slain my</a>
<a id='line_3215'>brother? thou shalt die therefore or thou depart. Well, said Balin, do</a>
<a id='line_3216'>it yourself. Yes, said King Pellam, there shall no man have ado with</a>
<a id='line_3217'>thee but myself, for the love of my brother. Then King Pellam caught in</a>
<a id='line_3218'>his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the</a>
<a id='line_3219'>sword betwixt his head and the stroke, and therewith his sword burst in</a>
<a id='line_3220'>sunder. And when Balin was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seek</a>
<a id='line_3221'>some weapon, and so from chamber to chamber, and no weapon he could</a>
<a id='line_3222'>find, and always King Pellam after him. And at the last he entered into</a>
<a id='line_3223'>a chamber that was marvellously well dight and richly, and a bed</a>
<a id='line_3224'>arrayed with cloth of gold, the richest that might be thought, and one</a>
<a id='line_3225'>lying therein, and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four</a>
<a id='line_3226'>pillars of silver that bare up the table, and upon the table stood a</a>
<a id='line_3227'>marvellous spear strangely wrought. And when Balin saw that spear, he</a>
<a id='line_3228'>gat it in his hand and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him</a>
<a id='line_3229'>passingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon,</a>
<a id='line_3230'>and therewith the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_3231'>and Balin fell down so that he might not stir foot nor hand. And so the</a>
<a id='line_3232'>most part of the castle, that was fallen down through that dolorous</a>
<a id='line_3233'>stroke, lay upon Pellam and Balin three days.</a>
<a id='line_3234'></a>
<a id='line_3235'></a>
<a id='line_3236'></a>
<a id='line_3237'>CHAPTER XVI. How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight that</a>
<a id='line_3238'>would have slain himself for love.</a>
<a id='line_3239'></a>
<a id='line_3240'>Then Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him a good horse,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>for his was dead, and bade him ride out of that country. I would have</a>
<a id='line_3242'>my damosel, said Balin. Lo, said Merlin, where she lieth dead. And King</a>
<a id='line_3243'>Pellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and might never be whole till</a>
<a id='line_3244'>Galahad the haut prince healed him in the quest of the Sangreal, for in</a>
<a id='line_3245'>that place was part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph</a>
<a id='line_3246'>of Arimathea brought into this land, and there himself lay in that rich</a>
<a id='line_3247'>bed. And that was the same spear that Longius smote our Lord to the</a>
<a id='line_3248'>heart; and King Pellam was nigh of Joseph’s kin, and that was the most</a>
<a id='line_3249'>worshipful man that lived in those days, and great pity it was of his</a>
<a id='line_3250'>hurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole, tray and tene.</a>
<a id='line_3251'>Then departed Balin from Merlin, and said, In this world we meet never</a>
<a id='line_3252'>no more. So he rode forth through the fair countries and cities, and</a>
<a id='line_3253'>found the people dead, slain on every side. And all that were alive</a>
<a id='line_3254'>cried, O Balin, thou hast caused great damage in these countries; for</a>
<a id='line_3255'>the dolorous stroke thou gavest unto King Pellam three countries are</a>
<a id='line_3256'>destroyed, and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the</a>
<a id='line_3257'>last. When Balin was past those countries he was passing fain.</a>
<a id='line_3258'></a>
<a id='line_3259'>So he rode eight days or he met with adventure. And at the last he came</a>
<a id='line_3260'>into a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there</a>
<a id='line_3261'>beside he saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside</a>
<a id='line_3262'>sat a fair knight on the ground and made great mourning, and he was a</a>
<a id='line_3263'>likely man, and a well made. Balin said, God save you, why be ye so</a>
<a id='line_3264'>heavy? tell me and I will amend it, an I may, to my power. Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>said he again, thou dost me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_3266'>and now thou puttest me to more pain. Balin went a little from him, and</a>
<a id='line_3267'>looked on his horse; then heard Balin him say thus: Ah, fair lady, why</a>
<a id='line_3268'>have ye broken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by</a>
<a id='line_3269'>noon, and I may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with</a>
<a id='line_3270'>this sword I slay myself, and pulled it out. And therewith Balin stert</a>
<a id='line_3271'>unto him and took him by the hand. Let go my hand, said the knight, or</a>
<a id='line_3272'>else I shall slay thee. That shall not need, said Balin, for I shall</a>
<a id='line_3273'>promise you my help to get you your lady, an ye will tell me where she</a>
<a id='line_3274'>is. What is your name? said the knight. My name is Balin le Savage. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>sir, I know you well enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and</a>
<a id='line_3276'>the man of most prowess of your hands living. What is your name? said</a>
<a id='line_3277'>Balin. My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man’s son, but by my</a>
<a id='line_3278'>prowess and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands;</a>
<a id='line_3279'>his name is Duke Hermel, and his daughter is she that I love, and she</a>
<a id='line_3280'>me as I deemed. How far is she hence? said Balin. But six mile, said</a>
<a id='line_3281'>the knight. Now ride we hence, said these two knights. So they rode</a>
<a id='line_3282'>more than a pace, till that they came to a fair castle well walled and</a>
<a id='line_3283'>ditched. I will into the castle, said Balin, and look if she be there.</a>
<a id='line_3284'>So he went in and searched from chamber to chamber, and found her bed,</a>
<a id='line_3285'>but she was not there. Then Balin looked into a fair little garden, and</a>
<a id='line_3286'>under a laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and a</a>
<a id='line_3287'>knight in her arms, fast halsing either other, and under their heads</a>
<a id='line_3288'>grass and herbs. When Balin saw her lie so with the foulest knight that</a>
<a id='line_3289'>ever he saw, and she a fair lady, then Balin went through all the</a>
<a id='line_3290'>chambers again, and told the knight how he found her as she had slept</a>
<a id='line_3291'>fast, and so brought him in the place there she lay fast sleeping.</a>
<a id='line_3292'></a>
<a id='line_3293'></a>
<a id='line_3294'></a>
<a id='line_3295'>CHAPTER XVII. How that knight slew his love and a knight lying by her,</a>
<a id='line_3296'>and after, how he slew himself with his own sword, and how Balin rode</a>
<a id='line_3297'>toward a castle where he lost his life.</a>
<a id='line_3298'></a>
<a id='line_3299'>And when Garnish beheld her so lying, for pure sorrow his mouth and</a>
<a id='line_3300'>nose burst out a-bleeding, and with his sword he smote off both their</a>
<a id='line_3301'>heads, and then he made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, much</a>
<a id='line_3302'>sorrow hast thou brought unto me, for hadst thou not shewed me that</a>
<a id='line_3303'>sight I should have passed my sorrow. Forsooth, said Balin, I did it to</a>
<a id='line_3304'>this intent that it should better thy courage, and that ye might see</a>
<a id='line_3305'>and know her falsehood, and to cause you to leave love of such a lady;</a>
<a id='line_3306'>God knoweth I did none other but as I would ye did to me. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_3307'>Garnish, now is my sorrow double that I may not endure, now have I</a>
<a id='line_3308'>slain that I most loved in all my life; and therewith suddenly he rove</a>
<a id='line_3309'>himself on his own sword unto the hilts. When Balin saw that, he</a>
<a id='line_3310'>dressed him thenceward, lest folk would say he had slain them; and so</a>
<a id='line_3311'>he rode forth, and within three days he came by a cross, and thereon</a>
<a id='line_3312'>were letters of gold written, that said, It is not for no knight alone</a>
<a id='line_3313'>to ride toward this castle. Then saw he an old hoar gentleman coming</a>
<a id='line_3314'>toward him, that said, Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds to come</a>
<a id='line_3315'>this way, therefore turn again and it will avail thee. And he vanished</a>
<a id='line_3316'>away anon; and so he heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a</a>
<a id='line_3317'>beast. That blast, said Balin, is blown for me, for I am the prize and</a>
<a id='line_3318'>yet am I not dead. Anon withal he saw an hundred ladies and many</a>
<a id='line_3319'>knights, that welcomed him with fair semblant, and made him passing</a>
<a id='line_3320'>good cheer unto his sight, and led him into the castle, and there was</a>
<a id='line_3321'>dancing and minstrelsy and all manner of joy. Then the chief lady of</a>
<a id='line_3322'>the castle said, Knight with the Two Swords, ye must have ado and joust</a>
<a id='line_3323'>with a knight hereby that keepeth an island, for there may no man pass</a>
<a id='line_3324'>this way but he must joust or he pass. That is an unhappy custom, said</a>
<a id='line_3325'>Balin, that a knight may not pass this way but if he joust. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3326'>not have ado but with one knight, said the lady.</a>
<a id='line_3327'></a>
<a id='line_3328'>Well, said Balin, since I shall thereto I am ready, but travelling men</a>
<a id='line_3329'>are oft weary and their horses too, but though my horse be weary my</a>
<a id='line_3330'>heart is not weary, I would be fain there my death should be. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_3331'>a knight to Balin, methinketh your shield is not good, I will lend you</a>
<a id='line_3332'>a bigger. Thereof I pray you. And so he took the shield that was</a>
<a id='line_3333'>unknown and left his own, and so rode unto the island, and put him and</a>
<a id='line_3334'>his horse in a great boat; and when he came on the other side he met</a>
<a id='line_3335'>with a damosel, and she said, O knight Balin, why have ye left your own</a>
<a id='line_3336'>shield? alas ye have put yourself in great danger, for by your shield</a>
<a id='line_3337'>ye should have been known; it is great pity of you as ever was of</a>
<a id='line_3338'>knight, for of thy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellow living. Me</a>
<a id='line_3339'>repenteth, said Balin, that ever I came within this country, but I may</a>
<a id='line_3340'>not turn now again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to me, be</a>
<a id='line_3341'>it life or death, I will take the adventure that shall come to me. And</a>
<a id='line_3342'>then he looked on his armour, and understood he was well armed, and</a>
<a id='line_3343'>therewith blessed him and mounted upon his horse.</a>
<a id='line_3344'></a>
<a id='line_3345'></a>
<a id='line_3346'></a>
<a id='line_3347'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Balin met with his brother Balan, and how each of</a>
<a id='line_3348'>them slew other unknown, till they were wounded to death.</a>
<a id='line_3349'></a>
<a id='line_3350'>Then afore him he saw come riding out of a castle a knight, and his</a>
<a id='line_3351'>horse trapped all red, and himself in the same colour. When this knight</a>
<a id='line_3352'>in the red beheld Balin, him thought it should be his brother Balin by</a>
<a id='line_3353'>cause of his two swords, but by cause he knew not his shield he deemed</a>
<a id='line_3354'>it was not he. And so they aventryd their spears and came marvellously</a>
<a id='line_3355'>fast together, and they smote each other in the shields, but their</a>
<a id='line_3356'>spears and their course were so big that it bare down horse and man,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>that they lay both in a swoon. But Balin was bruised sore with the fall</a>
<a id='line_3358'>of his horse, for he was weary of travel. And Balan was the first that</a>
<a id='line_3359'>rose on foot and drew his sword, and went toward Balin, and he arose</a>
<a id='line_3360'>and went against him; but Balan smote Balin first, and he put up his</a>
<a id='line_3361'>shield and smote him through the shield and tamed his helm. Then Balin</a>
<a id='line_3362'>smote him again with that unhappy sword, and well-nigh had felled his</a>
<a id='line_3363'>brother Balan, and so they fought there together till their breaths</a>
<a id='line_3364'>failed. Then Balin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand</a>
<a id='line_3365'>full of ladies. So they went unto battle again, and wounded everych</a>
<a id='line_3366'>other dolefully, and then they breathed ofttimes, and so went unto</a>
<a id='line_3367'>battle that all the place there as they fought was blood red. And at</a>
<a id='line_3368'>that time there was none of them both but they had either smitten other</a>
<a id='line_3369'>seven great wounds, so that the least of them might have been the death</a>
<a id='line_3370'>of the mightiest giant in this world.</a>
<a id='line_3371'></a>
<a id='line_3372'>Then they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to</a>
<a id='line_3373'>hear of that battle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks</a>
<a id='line_3374'>unnailed that naked they were on every side. At last Balan the younger</a>
<a id='line_3375'>brother withdrew him a little and laid him down. Then said Balin le</a>
<a id='line_3376'>Savage, What knight art thou? for or now I found never no knight that</a>
<a id='line_3377'>matched me. My name is, said he, Balan, brother unto the good knight,</a>
<a id='line_3378'>Balin. Alas, said Balin, that ever I should see this day, and therewith</a>
<a id='line_3379'>he fell backward in a swoon. Then Balan yede on all four feet and</a>
<a id='line_3380'>hands, and put off the helm off his brother, and might not know him by</a>
<a id='line_3381'>the visage it was so ful hewn and bled; but when he awoke he said, O</a>
<a id='line_3382'>Balan, my brother, thou hast slain me and I thee, wherefore all the</a>
<a id='line_3383'>wide world shall speak of us both. Alas, said Balan, that ever I saw</a>
<a id='line_3384'>this day, that through mishap I might not know you, for I espied well</a>
<a id='line_3385'>your two swords, but by cause ye had another shield I deemed ye had</a>
<a id='line_3386'>been another knight. Alas, said Balin, all that made an unhappy knight</a>
<a id='line_3387'>in the castle, for he caused me to leave my own shield to our both’s</a>
<a id='line_3388'>destruction, and if I might live I would destroy that castle for ill</a>
<a id='line_3389'>customs. That were well done, said Balan, for I had never grace to</a>
<a id='line_3390'>depart from them since that I came hither, for here it happed me to</a>
<a id='line_3391'>slay a knight that kept this island, and since might I never depart,</a>
<a id='line_3392'>and no more should ye, brother, an ye might have slain me as ye have,</a>
<a id='line_3393'>and escaped yourself with the life.</a>
<a id='line_3394'></a>
<a id='line_3395'>Right so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies</a>
<a id='line_3396'>and six yeomen unto them, and there she heard how they made their moan</a>
<a id='line_3397'>either to other, and said, We came both out of one tomb, that is to say</a>
<a id='line_3398'>one mother’s belly, and so shall we lie both in one pit. So Balan</a>
<a id='line_3399'>prayed the lady of her gentleness, for his true service, that she would</a>
<a id='line_3400'>bury them both in that same place there the battle was done. And she</a>
<a id='line_3401'>granted them, with weeping, it should be done richly in the best</a>
<a id='line_3402'>manner. Now, will ye send for a priest, that we may receive our</a>
<a id='line_3403'>sacrament, and receive the blessed body of our Lord Jesus Christ? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_3404'>said the lady, it shall be done; and so she sent for a priest and gave</a>
<a id='line_3405'>them their rights. Now, said Balin, when we are buried in one tomb, and</a>
<a id='line_3406'>the mention made over us how two brethren slew each other, there will</a>
<a id='line_3407'>never good knight, nor good man, see our tomb but they will pray for</a>
<a id='line_3408'>our souls. And so all the ladies and gentlewomen wept for pity. Then</a>
<a id='line_3409'>anon Balan died, but Balin died not till the midnight after, and so</a>
<a id='line_3410'>were they buried both, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he</a>
<a id='line_3411'>was there slain by his brother’s hands, but she knew not Balin’s name.</a>

<a id='line_3415'>CHAPTER XIX. How Merlin buried them both in one tomb, and of Balin’s</a>
<a id='line_3416'>sword.</a>
<a id='line_3417'></a>
<a id='line_3418'>In the morn came Merlin and let write Balin’s name on the tomb with</a>
<a id='line_3419'>letters of gold, that Here lieth Balin le Savage that was the Knight</a>
<a id='line_3420'>with the Two Swords, and he that smote the Dolorous Stroke. Also Merlin</a>
<a id='line_3421'>let make there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he</a>
<a id='line_3422'>went out of his wit, yet Launcelot de Lake fordid that bed through his</a>
<a id='line_3423'>noblesse. And anon after Balin was dead, Merlin took his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_3424'>took off the pommel and set on another pommel. So Merlin bade a knight</a>
<a id='line_3425'>that stood afore him handle that sword, and he assayed, and he might</a>
<a id='line_3426'>not handle it. Then Merlin laughed. Why laugh ye? said the knight. This</a>
<a id='line_3427'>is the cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this sword but</a>
<a id='line_3428'>the best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Launcelot or else</a>
<a id='line_3429'>Galahad his son, and Launcelot with this sword shall slay the man that</a>
<a id='line_3430'>in the world he loved best, that shall be Sir Gawaine. All this he let</a>
<a id='line_3431'>write in the pommel of the sword. Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron</a>
<a id='line_3432'>and of steel into that island, and it was but half a foot broad, and</a>
<a id='line_3433'>there shall never man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>but if he were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery</a>
<a id='line_3435'>or villainy. Also the scabbard of Balin’s sword Merlin left it on this</a>
<a id='line_3436'>side the island, that Galahad should find it. Also Merlin let make by</a>
<a id='line_3437'>his subtilty that Balin’s sword was put in a marble stone standing</a>
<a id='line_3438'>upright as great as a mill stone, and the stone hoved always above the</a>
<a id='line_3439'>water and did many years, and so by adventure it swam down the stream</a>
<a id='line_3440'>to the City of Camelot, that is in English Winchester. And that same</a>
<a id='line_3441'>day Galahad the haut prince came with King Arthur, and so Galahad</a>
<a id='line_3442'>brought with him the scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in</a>
<a id='line_3443'>the marble stone hoving upon the water. And on Whitsunday he achieved</a>
<a id='line_3444'>the sword as it is rehearsed in the book of Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_3445'></a>
<a id='line_3446'>Soon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him of the</a>
<a id='line_3447'>dolorous stroke that Balin gave to King Pellam, and how Balin and Balan</a>
<a id='line_3448'>fought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of, and how</a>
<a id='line_3449'>they were buried both in one tomb. Alas, said King Arthur, this is the</a>
<a id='line_3450'>greatest pity that ever I heard tell of two knights, for in the world I</a>
<a id='line_3451'>know not such two knights. Thus endeth the tale of Balin and of Balan,</a>
<a id='line_3452'>two brethren born in Northumberland, good knights.</a>

<a id='line_3462'>CHAPTER I. How King Arthur took a wife, and wedded Guenever, daughter</a>
<a id='line_3463'>to Leodegrance, King of the Land of Cameliard, with whom he had the</a>
<a id='line_3464'>Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_3465'></a>
<a id='line_3466'>In the beginning of Arthur, after he was chosen king by adventure and</a>
<a id='line_3467'>by grace; for the most part of the barons knew not that he was Uther</a>
<a id='line_3468'>Pendragon’s son, but as Merlin made it openly known. But yet many kings</a>
<a id='line_3469'>and lords held great war against him for that cause, but well Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3470'>overcame them all, for the most part the days of his life he was ruled</a>
<a id='line_3471'>much by the counsel of Merlin. So it fell on a time King Arthur said</a>
<a id='line_3472'>unto Merlin, My barons will let me have no rest, but needs I must take</a>
<a id='line_3473'>a wife, and I will none take but by thy counsel and by thine advice. It</a>
<a id='line_3474'>is well done, said Merlin, that ye take a wife, for a man of your</a>
<a id='line_3475'>bounty and noblesse should not be without a wife. Now is there any that</a>
<a id='line_3476'>ye love more than another? Yea, said King Arthur, I love Guenever the</a>
<a id='line_3477'>king’s daughter, Leodegrance of the land of Cameliard, the which</a>
<a id='line_3478'>holdeth in his house the Table Round that ye told he had of my father</a>
<a id='line_3479'>Uther. And this damosel is the most valiant and fairest lady that I</a>
<a id='line_3480'>know living, or yet that ever I could find. Sir, said Merlin, as of her</a>
<a id='line_3481'>beauty and fairness she is one of the fairest alive, but, an ye loved</a>
<a id='line_3482'>her not so well as ye do, I should find you a damosel of beauty and of</a>
<a id='line_3483'>goodness that should like you and please you, an your heart were not</a>
<a id='line_3484'>set; but there as a man’s heart is set, he will be loath to return.</a>
<a id='line_3485'>That is truth, said King Arthur. But Merlin warned the king covertly</a>
<a id='line_3486'>that Guenever was not wholesome for him to take to wife, for he warned</a>
<a id='line_3487'>him that Launcelot should love her, and she him again; and so he turned</a>
<a id='line_3488'>his tale to the adventures of Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_3489'></a>
<a id='line_3490'>Then Merlin desired of the king for to have men with him that should</a>
<a id='line_3491'>enquire of Guenever, and so the king granted him, and Merlin went forth</a>
<a id='line_3492'>unto King Leodegrance of Cameliard, and told him of the desires of the</a>
<a id='line_3493'>king that he would have unto his wife Guenever his daughter. That is to</a>
<a id='line_3494'>me, said King Leodegrance, the best tidings that ever I heard, that so</a>
<a id='line_3495'>worthy a king of prowess and noblesse will wed my daughter. And as for</a>
<a id='line_3496'>my lands, I will give him, wist I it might please him, but he hath</a>
<a id='line_3497'>lands enow, him needeth none; but I shall send him a gift shall please</a>
<a id='line_3498'>him much more, for I shall give him the Table Round, the which Uther</a>
<a id='line_3499'>Pendragon gave me, and when it is full complete, there is an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3500'>knights and fifty. And as for an hundred good knights I have myself,</a>
<a id='line_3501'>but I faute fifty, for so many have been slain in my days. And so</a>
<a id='line_3502'>Leodegrance delivered his daughter Guenever unto Merlin, and the Table</a>
<a id='line_3503'>Round with the hundred knights, and so they rode freshly, with great</a>
<a id='line_3504'>royalty, what by water and what by land, till that they came nigh unto</a>

<a id='line_3509'>CHAPTER II. How the Knights of the Round Table were ordained and their</a>
<a id='line_3510'>sieges blessed by the Bishop of Canterbury.</a>
<a id='line_3511'></a>
<a id='line_3512'>When King Arthur heard of the coming of Guenever and the hundred</a>
<a id='line_3513'>knights with the Table Round, then King Arthur made great joy for her</a>
<a id='line_3514'>coming, and that rich present, and said openly, This fair lady is</a>
<a id='line_3515'>passing welcome unto me, for I have loved her long, and therefore there</a>
<a id='line_3516'>is nothing so lief to me. And these knights with the Round Table please</a>
<a id='line_3517'>me more than right great riches. And in all haste the king let ordain</a>
<a id='line_3518'>for the marriage and the coronation in the most honourable wise that</a>
<a id='line_3519'>could be devised. Now, Merlin, said King Arthur, go thou and espy me in</a>
<a id='line_3520'>all this land fifty knights which be of most prowess and worship.</a>
<a id='line_3521'>Within short time Merlin had found such knights that should fulfil</a>
<a id='line_3522'>twenty and eight knights, but no more he could find. Then the Bishop of</a>
<a id='line_3523'>Canterbury was fetched, and he blessed the sieges with great royalty</a>
<a id='line_3524'>and devotion, and there set the eight and twenty knights in their</a>
<a id='line_3525'>sieges. And when this was done Merlin said, Fair sirs, ye must all</a>
<a id='line_3526'>arise and come to King Arthur for to do him homage; he will have the</a>
<a id='line_3527'>better will to maintain you. And so they arose and did their homage,</a>
<a id='line_3528'>and when they were gone Merlin found in every sieges letters of gold</a>
<a id='line_3529'>that told the knights’ names that had sitten therein. But two sieges</a>
<a id='line_3530'>were void. And so anon came young Gawaine and asked the king a gift.</a>
<a id='line_3531'>Ask, said the king, and I shall grant it you. Sir, I ask that ye will</a>
<a id='line_3532'>make me knight that same day ye shall wed fair Guenever. I will do it</a>
<a id='line_3533'>with a good will, said King Arthur, and do unto you all the worship</a>
<a id='line_3534'>that I may, for I must by reason ye are my nephew, my sister’s son.</a>
<a id='line_3535'></a>

<a id='line_3538'>CHAPTER III. How a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3539'>to make his son knight.</a>
<a id='line_3540'></a>
<a id='line_3541'>Forthwithal there came a poor man into the court, and brought with him</a>
<a id='line_3542'>a fair young man of eighteen years of age riding upon a lean mare; and</a>
<a id='line_3543'>the poor man asked all men that he met, Where shall I find King Arthur?</a>
<a id='line_3544'>Yonder he is, said the knights, wilt thou anything with him? Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_3545'>the poor man, therefore I came hither. Anon as he came before the king,</a>
<a id='line_3546'>he saluted him and said: O King Arthur, the flower of all knights and</a>
<a id='line_3547'>kings, I beseech Jesu save thee. Sir, it was told me that at this time</a>
<a id='line_3548'>of your marriage ye would give any man the gift that he would ask, out</a>
<a id='line_3549'>except that were unreasonable. That is truth, said the king, such cries</a>
<a id='line_3550'>I let make, and that will I hold, so it apair not my realm nor mine</a>
<a id='line_3551'>estate. Ye say well and graciously, said the poor man; Sir, I ask</a>
<a id='line_3552'>nothing else but that ye will make my son here a knight. It is a great</a>
<a id='line_3553'>thing thou askest of me, said the king. What is thy name? said the king</a>
<a id='line_3554'>to the poor man. Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd. Whether cometh this</a>
<a id='line_3555'>of thee or of thy son? said the king. Nay, sir, said Aries, this desire</a>
<a id='line_3556'>cometh of my son and not of me, for I shall tell you I have thirteen</a>
<a id='line_3557'>sons, and all they will fall to what labour I put them, and will be</a>
<a id='line_3558'>right glad to do labour, but this child will not labour for me, for</a>
<a id='line_3559'>anything that my wife or I may do, but always he will be shooting or</a>
<a id='line_3560'>casting darts, and glad for to see battles and to behold knights, and</a>
<a id='line_3561'>always day and night he desireth of me to be made a knight. What is thy</a>
<a id='line_3562'>name? said the king unto the young man. Sir, my name is Tor. The king</a>
<a id='line_3563'>beheld him fast, and saw he was passingly well-visaged and passingly</a>
<a id='line_3564'>well made of his years. Well, said King Arthur unto Aries the cowherd,</a>
<a id='line_3565'>fetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them. And so the poor man</a>
<a id='line_3566'>did, and all were shaped much like the poor man. But Tor was not like</a>
<a id='line_3567'>none of them all in shape nor in countenance, for he was much more than</a>
<a id='line_3568'>any of them. Now, said King Arthur unto the cow herd, where is the</a>
<a id='line_3569'>sword he shall be made knight withal? It is here, said Tor. Take it out</a>
<a id='line_3570'>of the sheath, said the king, and require me to make you a knight.</a>
<a id='line_3571'></a>
<a id='line_3572'>Then Tor alighted off his mare and pulled out his sword, kneeling, and</a>
<a id='line_3573'>requiring the king that he would make him knight, and that he might be</a>
<a id='line_3574'>a knight of the Table Round. As for a knight I will make you, and</a>
<a id='line_3575'>therewith smote him in the neck with the sword, saying, Be ye a good</a>
<a id='line_3576'>knight, and so I pray to God so ye may be, and if ye be of prowess and</a>
<a id='line_3577'>of worthiness ye shall be a knight of the Table Round. Now Merlin, said</a>
<a id='line_3578'>Arthur, say whether this Tor shall be a good knight or no. Yea, sir, he</a>
<a id='line_3579'>ought to be a good knight, for he is come of as good a man as any is</a>
<a id='line_3580'>alive, and of kings’ blood. How so, sir? said the king. I shall tell</a>
<a id='line_3581'>you, said Merlin: This poor man, Aries the cowherd, is not his father;</a>
<a id='line_3582'>he is nothing sib to him, for King Pellinore is his father. I suppose</a>
<a id='line_3583'>nay, said the cowherd. Fetch thy wife afore me, said Merlin, and she</a>
<a id='line_3584'>shall not say nay. Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair</a>
<a id='line_3585'>housewife, and there she answered Merlin full womanly, and there she</a>
<a id='line_3586'>told the king and Merlin that when she was a maid, and went to milk</a>
<a id='line_3587'>kine, there met with her a stern knight, and half by force he had my</a>
<a id='line_3588'>maidenhead, and at that time he begat my son Tor, and he took away from</a>
<a id='line_3589'>me my greyhound that I had that time with me, and said that he would</a>
<a id='line_3590'>keep the greyhound for my love. Ah, said the cowherd, I weened not</a>
<a id='line_3591'>this, but I may believe it well, for he had never no tatches of me.</a>
<a id='line_3592'>Sir, said Tor unto Merlin, dishonour not my mother. Sir, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_3593'>it is more for your worship than hurt, for your father is a good man</a>
<a id='line_3594'>and a king, and he may right well advance you and your mother, for ye</a>
<a id='line_3595'>were begotten or ever she was wedded. That is truth, said the wife. It</a>
<a id='line_3596'>is the less grief unto me, said the cowherd.</a>
<a id='line_3597'></a>
<a id='line_3598'></a>
<a id='line_3599'></a>
<a id='line_3600'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Tor was known for son of King Pellinore, and how</a>
<a id='line_3601'>Gawaine was made knight.</a>
<a id='line_3602'></a>
<a id='line_3603'>So on the morn King Pellinore came to the court of King Arthur, which</a>
<a id='line_3604'>had great joy of him, and told him of Tor, how he was his son, and how</a>
<a id='line_3605'>he had made him knight at the request of the cowherd. When Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_3606'>beheld Tor, he pleased him much. So the king made Gawaine knight, but</a>
<a id='line_3607'>Tor was the first he made at the feast. What is the cause, said King</a>
<a id='line_3608'>Arthur, that there be two places void in the sieges? Sir, said Merlin,</a>
<a id='line_3609'>there shall no man sit in those places but they that shall be of most</a>
<a id='line_3610'>worship. But in the Siege Perilous there shall no man sit therein but</a>
<a id='line_3611'>one, and if there be any so hardy to do it he shall be destroyed, and</a>
<a id='line_3612'>he that shall sit there shall have no fellow. And therewith Merlin took</a>
<a id='line_3613'>King Pellinore by the hand, and in the one hand next the two sieges and</a>
<a id='line_3614'>the Siege Perilous he said, in open audience, This is your place and</a>
<a id='line_3615'>best ye are worthy to sit therein of any that is here. Thereat sat Sir</a>
<a id='line_3616'>Gawaine in great envy and told Gaheris his brother, yonder knight is</a>
<a id='line_3617'>put to great worship, the which grieveth me sore, for he slew our</a>
<a id='line_3618'>father King Lot, therefore I will slay him, said Gawaine, with a sword</a>
<a id='line_3619'>that was sent me that is passing trenchant. Ye shall not so, said</a>
<a id='line_3620'>Gaheris, at this time, for at this time I am but a squire, and when I</a>
<a id='line_3621'>am made knight I will be avenged on him, and therefore, brother, it is</a>
<a id='line_3622'>best ye suffer till another time, that we may have him out of the</a>
<a id='line_3623'>court, for an we did so we should trouble this high feast. I will well,</a>
<a id='line_3624'>said Gawaine, as ye will.</a>
<a id='line_3625'></a>
<a id='line_3626'></a>
<a id='line_3627'></a>
<a id='line_3628'>CHAPTER V. How at feast of the wedding of King Arthur to Guenever, a</a>
<a id='line_3629'>white hart came into the hall, and thirty couple hounds, and how a</a>
<a id='line_3630'>brachet pinched the hart which was taken away.</a>
<a id='line_3631'></a>
<a id='line_3632'>Then was the high feast made ready, and the king was wedded at Camelot</a>
<a id='line_3633'>unto Dame Guenever in the church of Saint Stephen’s, with great</a>
<a id='line_3634'>solemnity. And as every man was set after his degree, Merlin went to</a>
<a id='line_3635'>all the knights of the Round Table, and bade them sit still, that none</a>
<a id='line_3636'>of them remove. For ye shall see a strange and a marvellous adventure.</a>
<a id='line_3637'>Right so as they sat there came running in a white hart into the hall,</a>
<a id='line_3638'>and a white brachet next him, and thirty couple of black running hounds</a>
<a id='line_3639'>came after with a great cry, and the hart went about the Table Round as</a>
<a id='line_3640'>he went by other boards. The white brachet bit him by the buttock and</a>
<a id='line_3641'>pulled out a piece, wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and</a>
<a id='line_3642'>overthrew a knight that sat at the board side; and therewith the knight</a>
<a id='line_3643'>arose and took up the brachet, and so went forth out of the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_3644'>took his horse and rode his way with the brachet. Right so anon came in</a>
<a id='line_3645'>a lady on a white palfrey, and cried aloud to King Arthur, Sir, suffer</a>
<a id='line_3646'>me not to have this despite, for the brachet was mine that the knight</a>
<a id='line_3647'>led away. I may not do therewith, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_3648'></a>
<a id='line_3649'>With this there came a knight riding all armed on a great horse, and</a>
<a id='line_3650'>took the lady away with him with force, and ever she cried and made</a>
<a id='line_3651'>great dole. When she was gone the king was glad, for she made such a</a>
<a id='line_3652'>noise. Nay, said Merlin, ye may not leave these adventures so lightly;</a>
<a id='line_3653'>for these adventures must be brought again or else it would be</a>
<a id='line_3654'>disworship to you and to your feast. I will, said the king, that all be</a>
<a id='line_3655'>done by your advice. Then, said Merlin, let call Sir Gawaine, for he</a>
<a id='line_3656'>must bring again the white hart. Also, sir, ye must let call Sir Tor,</a>
<a id='line_3657'>for he must bring again the brachet and the knight, or else slay him.</a>
<a id='line_3658'>Also let call King Pellinore, for he must bring again the lady and the</a>
<a id='line_3659'>knight, or else slay him. And these three knights shall do marvellous</a>
<a id='line_3660'>adventures or they come again. Then were they called all three as it</a>
<a id='line_3661'>rehearseth afore, and each of them took his charge, and armed them</a>
<a id='line_3662'>surely. But Sir Gawaine had the first request, and therefore we will</a>
<a id='line_3663'>begin at him.</a>
<a id='line_3664'></a>
<a id='line_3665'></a>
<a id='line_3666'></a>
<a id='line_3667'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Gawaine rode for to fetch again the hart, and how</a>
<a id='line_3668'>two brethren fought each against other for the hart.</a>
<a id='line_3669'></a>
<a id='line_3670'>Sir Gawaine rode more than a pace, and Gaheris his brother that rode</a>
<a id='line_3671'>with him instead of a squire to do him service. So as they rode they</a>
<a id='line_3672'>saw two knights fight on horseback passing sore, so Sir Gawaine and his</a>
<a id='line_3673'>brother rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought</a>
<a id='line_3674'>so. The one knight answered and said, We fight for a simple matter, for</a>
<a id='line_3675'>we two be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman.</a>
<a id='line_3676'>Alas, said Sir Gawaine, why do ye so? Sir, said the elder, there came a</a>
<a id='line_3677'>white hart this way this day, and many hounds chased him, and a white</a>
<a id='line_3678'>brachet was alway next him, and we understood it was adventure made for</a>
<a id='line_3679'>the high feast of King Arthur, and therefore I would have gone after to</a>
<a id='line_3680'>have won me worship; and here my younger brother said he would go after</a>
<a id='line_3681'>the hart, for he was better knight than I: and for this cause we fell</a>
<a id='line_3682'>at debate, and so we thought to prove which of us both was better</a>
<a id='line_3683'>knight. This is a simple cause, said Sir Gawaine; uncouth men ye should</a>
<a id='line_3684'>debate withal, and not brother with brother; therefore but if you will</a>
<a id='line_3685'>do by my counsel I will have ado with you, that is ye shall yield you</a>
<a id='line_3686'>unto me, and that ye go unto King Arthur and yield you unto his grace.</a>
<a id='line_3687'>Sir knight, said the two brethren, we are forfoughten and much blood</a>
<a id='line_3688'>have we lost through our wilfulness, and therefore we would be loath to</a>
<a id='line_3689'>have ado with you. Then do as I will have you, said Sir Gawaine. We</a>
<a id='line_3690'>will agree to fulfil your will; but by whom shall we say that we be</a>
<a id='line_3691'>thither sent? Ye may say, By the knight that followeth the quest of the</a>
<a id='line_3692'>hart that was white. Now what is your name? said Gawaine. Sorlouse of</a>
<a id='line_3693'>the Forest, said the elder. And my name is, said the younger, Brian of</a>
<a id='line_3694'>the Forest. And so they departed and went to the king’s court, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_3695'>Gawaine on his quest.</a>
<a id='line_3696'></a>
<a id='line_3697'>And as Gawaine followed the hart by the cry of the hounds, even afore</a>
<a id='line_3698'>him there was a great river, and the hart swam over; and as Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_3699'>would follow after, there stood a knight over the other side, and said,</a>
<a id='line_3700'>Sir knight, come not over after this hart but if thou wilt joust with</a>
<a id='line_3701'>me. I will not fail as for that, said Sir Gawaine, to follow the quest</a>
<a id='line_3702'>that I am in, and so made his horse to swim over the water. And anon</a>
<a id='line_3703'>they gat their spears and ran together full hard; but Sir Gawaine smote</a>
<a id='line_3704'>him off his horse, and then he turned his horse and bade him yield him.</a>
<a id='line_3705'>Nay, said the knight, not so, though thou have the better of me on</a>
<a id='line_3706'>horseback. I pray thee, valiant knight, alight afoot, and match we</a>
<a id='line_3707'>together with swords. What is your name? said Sir Gawaine. Allardin of</a>
<a id='line_3708'>the Isles, said the other. Then either dressed their shields and smote</a>
<a id='line_3709'>together, but Sir Gawaine smote him so hard through the helm that it</a>
<a id='line_3710'>went to the brains, and the knight fell down dead. Ah! said Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_3711'>that was a mighty stroke of a young knight.</a>
<a id='line_3712'></a>
<a id='line_3713'></a>
<a id='line_3714'></a>
<a id='line_3715'>CHAPTER VII How the hart was chased into a castle and there slain, and</a>
<a id='line_3716'>how Sir Gawaine slew a lady.</a>
<a id='line_3717'></a>
<a id='line_3718'>Then Gawaine and Gaheris rode more than a pace after the white hart,</a>
<a id='line_3719'>and let slip at the hart three couple of greyhounds, and so they chased</a>
<a id='line_3720'>the hart into a castle, and in the chief place of the castle they slew</a>
<a id='line_3721'>the hart; Sir Gawaine and Gaheris followed after. Right so there came a</a>
<a id='line_3722'>knight out of a chamber with a sword drawn in his hand and slew two of</a>
<a id='line_3723'>the greyhounds, even in the sight of Sir Gawaine, and the remnant he</a>
<a id='line_3724'>chased them with his sword out of the castle. And when he came again,</a>
<a id='line_3725'>he said, O my white hart, me repenteth that thou art dead, for my</a>
<a id='line_3726'>sovereign lady gave thee to me, and evil have I kept thee, and thy</a>
<a id='line_3727'>death shall be dear bought an I live. And anon he went into his chamber</a>
<a id='line_3728'>and armed him, and came out fiercely, and there met he with Sir</a>
<a id='line_3729'>Gawaine. Why have ye slain my hounds? said Sir Gawaine, for they did</a>
<a id='line_3730'>but their kind, and liefer I had ye had wroken your anger upon me than</a>
<a id='line_3731'>upon a dumb beast. Thou sayest truth, said the knight, I have avenged</a>
<a id='line_3732'>me on thy hounds, and so I will on thee or thou go. Then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_3733'>alighted afoot and dressed his shield, and struck together mightily,</a>
<a id='line_3734'>and clave their shields, and stoned their helms, and brake their</a>
<a id='line_3735'>hauberks that the blood ran down to their feet.</a>
<a id='line_3736'></a>
<a id='line_3737'>At the last Sir Gawaine smote the knight so hard that he fell to the</a>
<a id='line_3738'>earth, and then he cried mercy, and yielded him, and besought him as he</a>
<a id='line_3739'>was a knight and gentleman, to save his life. Thou shalt die, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3740'>Gawaine, for slaying of my hounds. I will make amends, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>unto my power. Sir Gawaine would no mercy have, but unlaced his helm to</a>
<a id='line_3742'>have stricken off his head. Right so came his lady out of a chamber and</a>
<a id='line_3743'>fell over him, and so he smote off her head by misadventure. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_3744'>Gaheris, that is foully and shamefully done, that shame shall never</a>
<a id='line_3745'>from you; also ye should give mercy unto them that ask mercy, for a</a>
<a id='line_3746'>knight without mercy is without worship. Sir Gawaine was so stonied of</a>
<a id='line_3747'>the death of this fair lady that he wist not what he did, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_3748'>the knight, Arise, I will give thee mercy. Nay, nay, said the knight, I</a>
<a id='line_3749'>take no force of mercy now, for thou hast slain my love and my lady</a>
<a id='line_3750'>that I loved best of all earthly things. Me sore repenteth it, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3751'>Gawaine, for I thought to strike unto thee; but now thou shalt go unto</a>
<a id='line_3752'>King Arthur and tell him of thine adventures, and how thou art overcome</a>
<a id='line_3753'>by the knight that went in the quest of the white hart. I take no</a>
<a id='line_3754'>force, said the knight, whether I live or I die; but so for dread of</a>
<a id='line_3755'>death he swore to go unto King Arthur, and he made him to bear one</a>
<a id='line_3756'>greyhound before him on his horse, and another behind him. What is your</a>
<a id='line_3757'>name? said Sir Gawaine, or we depart. My name is, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_3758'>Ablamar of the Marsh. So he departed toward Camelot.</a>

<a id='line_3762'>CHAPTER VIII. How four knights fought against Gawaine and Gaheris, and</a>
<a id='line_3763'>how they were overcome, and their lives saved at request of four</a>
<a id='line_3764'>ladies.</a>
<a id='line_3765'></a>
<a id='line_3766'>And Sir Gawaine went into the castle, and made him ready to lie there</a>
<a id='line_3767'>all night, and would have unarmed him. What will ye do, said Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_3768'>will ye unarm you in this country? Ye may think ye have many enemies</a>
<a id='line_3769'>here. They had not sooner said that word but there came four knights</a>
<a id='line_3770'>well armed, and assailed Sir Gawaine hard, and said unto him, Thou</a>
<a id='line_3771'>new-made knight, thou hast shamed thy knighthood, for a knight without</a>
<a id='line_3772'>mercy is dishonoured. Also thou hast slain a fair lady to thy great</a>
<a id='line_3773'>shame to the world’s end, and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need</a>
<a id='line_3774'>of mercy or thou depart from us. And therewith one of them smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_3775'>Gawaine a great stroke that nigh he fell to the earth, and Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_3776'>smote him again sore, and so they were on the one side and on the</a>
<a id='line_3777'>other, that Sir Gawaine and Gaheris were in jeopardy of their lives;</a>
<a id='line_3778'>and one with a bow, an archer, smote Sir Gawaine through the arm that</a>
<a id='line_3779'>it grieved him wonderly sore. And as they should have been slain, there</a>
<a id='line_3780'>came four fair ladies, and besought the knights of grace for Sir</a>
<a id='line_3781'>Gawaine; and goodly at request of the ladies they gave Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_3782'>Gaheris their lives, and made them to yield them as prisoners. Then</a>
<a id='line_3783'>Gawaine and Gaheris made great dole. Alas! said Sir Gawaine, mine arm</a>
<a id='line_3784'>grieveth me sore, I am like to be maimed; and so made his complaint</a>
<a id='line_3785'>piteously.</a>
<a id='line_3786'></a>
<a id='line_3787'>Early on the morrow there came to Sir Gawaine one of the four ladies</a>
<a id='line_3788'>that had heard all his complaint, and said, Sir knight, what cheer? Not</a>
<a id='line_3789'>good, said he. It is your own default, said the lady, for ye have done</a>
<a id='line_3790'>a passing foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great</a>
<a id='line_3791'>villainy unto you. But be ye not of King Arthur’s kin? said the lady.</a>
<a id='line_3792'>Yes truly, said Sir Gawaine. What is your name? said the lady, ye must</a>
<a id='line_3793'>tell it me or ye pass. My name is Gawaine, the King Lot of Orkney’s</a>
<a id='line_3794'>son, and my mother is King Arthur’s sister. Ah! then are ye nephew unto</a>
<a id='line_3795'>King Arthur, said the lady, and I shall so speak for you that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3796'>have conduct to go to King Arthur for his love. And so she departed and</a>
<a id='line_3797'>told the four knights how their prisoner was King Arthur’s nephew, and</a>
<a id='line_3798'>his name is Sir Gawaine, King Lot’s son of Orkney. And they gave him</a>
<a id='line_3799'>the hart’s head because it was in his quest. Then anon they delivered</a>
<a id='line_3800'>Sir Gawaine under this promise, that he should bear the dead lady with</a>
<a id='line_3801'>him in this manner; the head of her was hanged about his neck, and the</a>
<a id='line_3802'>whole body of her lay before him on his horse’s mane. Right so rode he</a>
<a id='line_3803'>forth unto Camelot. And anon as he was come, Merlin desired of King</a>
<a id='line_3804'>Arthur that Sir Gawaine should be sworn to tell of all his adventures,</a>
<a id='line_3805'>and how he slew the lady, and how he would give no mercy unto the</a>
<a id='line_3806'>knight, wherethrough the lady was slain. Then the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_3807'>were greatly displeased with Sir Gawaine for the slaying of the lady.</a>
<a id='line_3808'>And there by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on</a>
<a id='line_3809'>Sir Gawaine, and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with all</a>
<a id='line_3810'>ladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he should be</a>
<a id='line_3811'>courteous, and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy. Thus was</a>
<a id='line_3812'>Gawaine sworn upon the Four Evangelists that he should never be against</a>
<a id='line_3813'>lady nor gentlewoman, but if he fought for a lady and his adversary</a>
<a id='line_3814'>fought for another. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawaine that</a>
<a id='line_3815'>he did at the marriage of King Arthur. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_3816'></a>
<a id='line_3817'></a>
<a id='line_3818'></a>
<a id='line_3819'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Tor rode after the knight with the brachet, and of</a>
<a id='line_3820'>his adventure by the way.</a>
<a id='line_3821'></a>
<a id='line_3822'>When Sir Tor was ready, he mounted upon his horseback, and rode after</a>
<a id='line_3823'>the knight with the brachet. So as he rode he met with a dwarf suddenly</a>
<a id='line_3824'>that smote his horse on the head with a staff, that he went backward</a>
<a id='line_3825'>his spear length. Why dost thou so? said Sir Tor. For thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_3826'>pass this way, but if thou joust with yonder knights of the pavilions.</a>
<a id='line_3827'>Then was Tor ware where two pavilions were, and great spears stood out,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>and two shields hung on trees by the pavilions. I may not tarry, said</a>
<a id='line_3829'>Sir Tor, for I am in a quest that I must needs follow. Thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_3830'>pass, said the dwarf, and therewithal he blew his horn. Then there came</a>
<a id='line_3831'>one armed on horseback, and dressed his shield, and came fast toward</a>
<a id='line_3832'>Tor, and he dressed him against him, and so ran together that Tor bare</a>
<a id='line_3833'>him from his horse. And anon the knight yielded him to his mercy. But,</a>
<a id='line_3834'>sir, I have a fellow in yonder pavilion that will have ado with you</a>
<a id='line_3835'>anon. He shall be welcome, said Sir Tor. Then was he ware of another</a>
<a id='line_3836'>knight coming with great raundon, and each of them dressed to other,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>that marvel it was to see; but the knight smote Sir Tor a great stroke</a>
<a id='line_3838'>in midst of the shield that his spear all to-shivered. And Sir Tor</a>
<a id='line_3839'>smote him through the shield below of the shield that it went through</a>
<a id='line_3840'>the cost of the knight, but the stroke slew him not. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_3841'>Tor alighted and smote him on the helm a great stroke, and therewith</a>
<a id='line_3842'>the knight yielded him and besought him of mercy. I will well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3843'>Tor, but thou and thy fellow must go unto King Arthur, and yield you</a>
<a id='line_3844'>prisoners unto him. By whom shall we say are we thither sent? Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3845'>say by the knight that went in the quest of the knight that went with</a>
<a id='line_3846'>the brachet. Now, what be your two names? said Sir Tor. My name is,</a>
<a id='line_3847'>said the one, Sir Felot of Langduk; and my name is, said the other, Sir</a>
<a id='line_3848'>Petipase of Winchelsea. Now go ye forth, said Sir Tor, and God speed</a>
<a id='line_3849'>you and me. Then came the dwarf and said unto Sir Tor, I pray you give</a>
<a id='line_3850'>me a gift. I will well, said Sir Tor, ask. I ask no more, said the</a>
<a id='line_3851'>dwarf, but that ye will suffer me to do you service, for I will serve</a>
<a id='line_3852'>no more recreant knights. Take an horse, said Sir Tor, and ride on with</a>
<a id='line_3853'>me. I wot ye ride after the knight with the white brachet, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_3854'>bring you where he is, said the dwarf. And so they rode throughout a</a>
<a id='line_3855'>forest, and at the last they were ware of two pavilions, even by a</a>
<a id='line_3856'>priory, with two shields, and the one shield was enewed with white, and</a>
<a id='line_3857'>the other shield was red.</a>

<a id='line_3862'>assailed him for the said brachet.</a>
<a id='line_3863'></a>
<a id='line_3864'>Therewith Sir Tor alighted and took the dwarf his glaive, and so he</a>
<a id='line_3865'>came to the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it, on one</a>
<a id='line_3866'>pallet, sleeping, and so he went to the other pavilion, and found a</a>
<a id='line_3867'>lady lying sleeping therein, but there was the white brachet that bayed</a>
<a id='line_3868'>at her fast, and therewith the lady yede out of the pavilion and all</a>
<a id='line_3869'>her damosels. But anon as Sir Tor espied the white brachet, he took her</a>
<a id='line_3870'>by force and took her to the dwarf. What, will ye so, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_3871'>take my brachet from me? Yea, said Sir Tor, this brachet have I sought</a>
<a id='line_3872'>from King Arthur’s court hither. Well, said the lady, knight, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3873'>not go far with her, but that ye shall be met and grieved. I shall</a>
<a id='line_3874'>abide what adventure that cometh by the grace of God, and so mounted</a>
<a id='line_3875'>upon his horse, and passed on his way toward Camelot; but it was so</a>
<a id='line_3876'>near night he might not pass but little further. Know ye any lodging?</a>
<a id='line_3877'>said Tor. I know none, said the dwarf, but here beside is an hermitage,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>and there ye must take lodging as ye find. And within a while they came</a>
<a id='line_3879'>to the hermitage and took lodging; and was there grass, oats and bread</a>
<a id='line_3880'>for their horses; soon it was sped, and full hard was their supper; but</a>
<a id='line_3881'>there they rested them all night till on the morn, and heard a mass</a>
<a id='line_3882'>devoutly, and took their leave of the hermit, and Sir Tor prayed the</a>
<a id='line_3883'>hermit to pray for him. He said he would, and betook him to God. And so</a>
<a id='line_3884'>mounted upon horseback and rode towards Camelot a long while.</a>
<a id='line_3885'></a>
<a id='line_3886'>With that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and he</a>
<a id='line_3887'>said, Knight, abide and yield my brachet that thou took from my lady.</a>
<a id='line_3888'>Sir Tor returned again, and beheld him how he was a seemly knight and</a>
<a id='line_3889'>well horsed, and well armed at all points; then Sir Tor dressed his</a>
<a id='line_3890'>shield, and took his spear in his hands, and the other came fiercely</a>
<a id='line_3891'>upon him, and smote both horse and man to the earth. Anon they arose</a>
<a id='line_3892'>lightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions, and put their</a>
<a id='line_3893'>shields afore them, and smote through the shields, that the cantels</a>
<a id='line_3894'>fell off both parties. Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood</a>
<a id='line_3895'>ran out, and the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in</a>
<a id='line_3896'>sunder that the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many</a>
<a id='line_3897'>wounds and were passing weary. But Sir Tor espied that the other knight</a>
<a id='line_3898'>fainted, and then he sued fast upon him, and doubled his strokes, and</a>
<a id='line_3899'>gart him go to the earth on the one side. Then Sir Tor bade him yield</a>
<a id='line_3900'>him. That will I not, said Abelleus, while my life lasteth and the soul</a>
<a id='line_3901'>is within my body, unless that thou wilt give me the brachet. That will</a>
<a id='line_3902'>I not do, said Sir Tor, for it was my quest to bring again thy brachet,</a>
<a id='line_3903'>thee, or both.</a>

<a id='line_3905'></a>

<a id='line_3907'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he lost his head</a>
<a id='line_3908'>at the request of a lady.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>With that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she might</a>
<a id='line_3911'>drive, and cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor. What will ye with me?</a>
<a id='line_3912'>said Sir Tor. I beseech thee, said the damosel, for King Arthur’s love,</a>
<a id='line_3913'>give me a gift; I require thee, gentle knight, as thou art a gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_3914'>Now, said Tor, ask a gift and I will give it you. Gramercy, said the</a>
<a id='line_3915'>damosel; now I ask the head of the false knight Abelleus, for he is the</a>
<a id='line_3916'>most outrageous knight that liveth, and the greatest murderer. I am</a>
<a id='line_3917'>loath, said Sir Tor, of that gift I have given you; let him make amends</a>
<a id='line_3918'>in that he hath trespassed unto you. Now, said the damosel, he may not,</a>
<a id='line_3919'>for he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was a better</a>
<a id='line_3920'>knight than he, an he had had grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore</a>
<a id='line_3921'>him in the mire for to save my brother’s life, that had done him no</a>
<a id='line_3922'>damage, but fought with him by adventure of arms, and so for all that I</a>
<a id='line_3923'>could do he struck off his head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art</a>
<a id='line_3924'>a true knight, to give me my gift, or else I shall shame thee in all</a>
<a id='line_3925'>the court of King Arthur; for he is the falsest knight living, and a</a>
<a id='line_3926'>great destroyer of good knights. Then when Abelleus heard this, he was</a>
<a id='line_3927'>more afeard, and yielded him and asked mercy. I may not now, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3928'>Tor, but if I should be found false of my promise; for while I would</a>
<a id='line_3929'>have taken you to mercy ye would none ask, but if ye had the brachet</a>
<a id='line_3930'>again, that was my quest. And therewith he took off his helm, and he</a>
<a id='line_3931'>arose and fled, and Sir Tor after him, and smote off his head quite.</a>
<a id='line_3932'></a>
<a id='line_3933'>Now sir, said the damosel, it is near night; I pray you come and lodge</a>
<a id='line_3934'>with me here at my place, it is here fast by. I will well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3935'>Tor, for his horse and he had fared evil since they departed from</a>
<a id='line_3936'>Camelot, and so he rode with her, and had passing good cheer with her;</a>
<a id='line_3937'>and she had a passing fair old knight to her husband that made him</a>
<a id='line_3938'>passing good cheer, and well eased both his horse and him. And on the</a>
<a id='line_3939'>morn he heard his mass, and brake his fast, and took his leave of the</a>
<a id='line_3940'>knight and of the lady, that besought him to tell them his name. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_3941'>he said, my name is Sir Tor that was late made knight, and this was the</a>
<a id='line_3942'>first quest of arms that ever I did, to bring again that this knight</a>
<a id='line_3943'>Abelleus took away from King Arthur’s court. O fair knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_3944'>lady and her husband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our</a>
<a id='line_3945'>poor lodging, and it shall be always at your commandment. So Sir Tor</a>
<a id='line_3946'>departed and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and the king and</a>
<a id='line_3947'>the queen and all the court was passing fain of his coming, and made</a>
<a id='line_3948'>great joy that he was come again; for he went from the court with</a>
<a id='line_3949'>little succour, but as King Pellinore his father gave him an old</a>
<a id='line_3950'>courser, and King Arthur gave him armour and a sword, and else had he</a>
<a id='line_3951'>none other succour, but rode so forth himself alone. And then the king</a>
<a id='line_3952'>and the queen by Merlin’s advice made him to swear to tell of his</a>
<a id='line_3953'>adventures, and so he told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore</a>
<a id='line_3954'>rehearsed, wherefore the king and the queen made great joy. Nay, nay,</a>
<a id='line_3955'>said Merlin, these be but japes to that he shall do; for he shall prove</a>
<a id='line_3956'>a noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living, and gentle and</a>
<a id='line_3957'>courteous, and of good tatches, and passing true of his promise, and</a>
<a id='line_3958'>never shall outrage. Wherethrough Merlin’s words King Arthur gave him</a>
<a id='line_3959'>an earldom of lands that fell unto him. And here endeth the quest of</a>
<a id='line_3960'>Sir Tor, King Pellinore’s son.</a>

<a id='line_3962'></a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>CHAPTER XII. How King Pellinore rode after the lady and the knight that</a>
<a id='line_3965'>led her away, and how a lady desired help of him, and how he fought</a>
<a id='line_3966'>with two knights for that lady, of whom he slew the one at the first</a>
<a id='line_3967'>stroke.</a>
<a id='line_3968'></a>
<a id='line_3969'>Then King Pellinore armed him and mounted upon his horse, and rode more</a>
<a id='line_3970'>than a pace after the lady that the knight led away. And as he rode in</a>
<a id='line_3971'>a forest, he saw in a valley a damosel sit by a well, and a wounded</a>
<a id='line_3972'>knight in her arms, and Pellinore saluted her. And when she was ware of</a>
<a id='line_3973'>him, she cried overloud, Help me, knight; for Christ’s sake, King</a>
<a id='line_3974'>Pellinore. And he would not tarry, he was so eager in his quest, and</a>
<a id='line_3975'>ever she cried an hundred times after help. When she saw he would not</a>
<a id='line_3976'>abide, she prayed unto God to send him as much need of help as she had,</a>
<a id='line_3977'>and that he might feel it or he died. So, as the book telleth, the</a>
<a id='line_3978'>knight there died that there was wounded, wherefore the lady for pure</a>
<a id='line_3979'>sorrow slew herself with his sword. As King Pellinore rode in that</a>
<a id='line_3980'>valley he met with a poor man, a labourer. Sawest thou not, said</a>
<a id='line_3981'>Pellinore, a knight riding and leading away a lady? Yea, said the man,</a>
<a id='line_3982'>I saw that knight, and the lady that made great dole; and yonder</a>
<a id='line_3983'>beneath in a valley there shall ye see two pavilions, and one of the</a>
<a id='line_3984'>knights of the pavilions challenged that lady of that knight, and said</a>
<a id='line_3985'>she was his cousin near, wherefore he should lead her no farther. And</a>
<a id='line_3986'>so they waged battle in that quarrel, the one said he would have her by</a>
<a id='line_3987'>force, and the other said he would have the rule of her, by cause he</a>
<a id='line_3988'>was her kinsman, and would lead her to her kin. For this quarrel he</a>
<a id='line_3989'>left them fighting. And if ye will ride a pace ye shall find them</a>
<a id='line_3990'>fighting, and the lady was beleft with the two squires in the</a>
<a id='line_3991'>pavilions. God thank thee, said King Pellinore.</a>
<a id='line_3992'></a>
<a id='line_3993'>Then he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two pavilions, and the</a>
<a id='line_3994'>two knights fighting. Anon he rode unto the pavilions, and saw the lady</a>
<a id='line_3995'>that was his quest, and said, Fair lady, ye must go with me unto the</a>
<a id='line_3996'>court of King Arthur. Sir knight, said the two squires that were with</a>
<a id='line_3997'>her, yonder are two knights that fight for this lady, go thither and</a>
<a id='line_3998'>depart them, and be agreed with them, and then may ye have her at your</a>
<a id='line_3999'>pleasure. Ye say well, said King Pellinore. And anon he rode betwixt</a>
<a id='line_4000'>them, and departed them, and asked them the causes why that they</a>
<a id='line_4001'>fought? Sir knight, said the one, I shall tell you, this lady is my</a>
<a id='line_4002'>kinswoman nigh, mine aunt’s daughter, and when I heard her complain</a>
<a id='line_4003'>that she was with him maugre her head, I waged battle to fight with</a>
<a id='line_4004'>him. Sir knight, said the other, whose name was Hontzlake of Wentland,</a>
<a id='line_4005'>and this lady I gat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_4006'>That is untruly said, said King Pellinore, for ye came in suddenly</a>
<a id='line_4007'>there as we were at the high feast, and took away this lady or any man</a>
<a id='line_4008'>might make him ready; and therefore it was my quest to bring her again</a>
<a id='line_4009'>and you both, or else the one of us to abide in the field; therefore</a>
<a id='line_4010'>the lady shall go with me, or I will die for it, for I have promised it</a>
<a id='line_4011'>King Arthur. And therefore fight ye no more, for none of you shall have</a>
<a id='line_4012'>no part of her at this time; and if ye list to fight for her, fight</a>
<a id='line_4013'>with me, and I will defend her. Well, said the knights, make you ready,</a>
<a id='line_4014'>and we shall assail you with all our power. And as King Pellinore would</a>
<a id='line_4015'>have put his horse from them, Sir Hontzlake rove his horse through with</a>
<a id='line_4016'>a sword, and said: Now art thou on foot as well as we are. When King</a>
<a id='line_4017'>Pellinore espied that his horse was slain, lightly he leapt from his</a>
<a id='line_4018'>horse and pulled out his sword, and put his shield afore him, and said,</a>
<a id='line_4019'>Knight, keep well thy head, for thou shalt have a buffet for the</a>
<a id='line_4020'>slaying of my horse. So King Pellinore gave him such a stroke upon the</a>
<a id='line_4021'>helm that he clave the head down to the chin, that he fell to the earth</a>
<a id='line_4022'>dead.</a>

<a id='line_4026'>CHAPTER XIII. How King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her to</a>
<a id='line_4027'>Camelot to the court of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4028'></a>
<a id='line_4029'>And then he turned him to the other knight, that was sore wounded. But</a>
<a id='line_4030'>when he saw the other’s buffet, he would not fight, but kneeled down</a>
<a id='line_4031'>and said, Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I</a>
<a id='line_4032'>require you, as ye be a true knight, put her to no shame nor villainy.</a>
<a id='line_4033'>What, said King Pellinore, will ye not fight for her? No, sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_4034'>knight, I will not fight with such a knight of prowess as ye be. Well,</a>
<a id='line_4035'>said Pellinore, ye say well; I promise you she shall have no villainy</a>
<a id='line_4036'>by me, as I am true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said</a>
<a id='line_4037'>Pellinore, but I will have Hontzlake’s horse. Ye shall not need, said</a>
<a id='line_4038'>the knight, for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so</a>
<a id='line_4039'>that you will lodge with me, for it is near night. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_4040'>King Pellinore, abide with you all night. And there he had with him</a>
<a id='line_4041'>right good cheer, and fared of the best with passing good wine, and had</a>
<a id='line_4042'>merry rest that night. And on the morn he heard a mass and dined; and</a>
<a id='line_4043'>then was brought him a fair bay courser, and King Pellinore’s saddle</a>
<a id='line_4044'>set upon him. Now, what shall I call you? said the knight, inasmuch as</a>
<a id='line_4045'>ye have my cousin at your desire of your quest. Sir, I shall tell you,</a>
<a id='line_4046'>my name is King Pellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_4047'>Now I am glad, said the knight, that such a noble man shall have the</a>
<a id='line_4048'>rule of my cousin. Now, what is your name? said Pellinore, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_4049'>tell me. Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my cousin</a>
<a id='line_4050'>hight Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn</a>
<a id='line_4051'>brother, a passing good knight, and his name is Brian of the Isles, and</a>
<a id='line_4052'>he is full loath to do wrong, and full loath to fight with any man, but</a>
<a id='line_4053'>if he be sore sought on, so that for shame he may not leave it. It is</a>
<a id='line_4054'>marvel, said Pellinore, that he will not have ado with me. Sir, he will</a>
<a id='line_4055'>not have ado with no man but if it be at his request. Bring him to the</a>
<a id='line_4056'>court, said Pellinore, one of these days. Sir, we will come together.</a>
<a id='line_4057'>And ye shall be welcome, said Pellinore, to the court of King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_4058'>and greatly allowed for your coming. And so he departed with the lady,</a>
<a id='line_4059'>and brought her to Camelot.</a>
<a id='line_4060'></a>
<a id='line_4061'>So as they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the lady’s</a>
<a id='line_4062'>horse stumbled and threw her down, that her arm was sore bruised and</a>
<a id='line_4063'>near she swooned for pain. Alas! sir, said the lady, mine arm is out of</a>
<a id='line_4064'>lithe, wherethrough I must needs rest me. Ye shall well, said King</a>
<a id='line_4065'>Pellinore. And so he alighted under a fair tree where was fair grass,</a>
<a id='line_4066'>and he put his horse thereto, and so laid him under the tree and slept</a>
<a id='line_4067'>till it was nigh night. And when he awoke he would have ridden. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_4068'>said the lady, it is so dark that ye may as well ride backward as</a>
<a id='line_4069'>forward. So they abode still and made there their lodging. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_4070'>Pellinore put off his armour; then a little afore midnight they heard</a>
<a id='line_4071'>the trotting of an horse. Be ye still, said King Pellinore, for we</a>
<a id='line_4072'>shall hear of some adventure.</a>
<a id='line_4073'></a>
<a id='line_4074'></a>
<a id='line_4075'></a>
<a id='line_4076'>CHAPTER XIV. How on the way he heard two knights, as he lay by night in</a>
<a id='line_4077'>a valley, and of their adventures.</a>
<a id='line_4078'></a>
<a id='line_4079'>And therewith he armed him. So right even afore him there met two</a>
<a id='line_4080'>knights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the north,</a>
<a id='line_4081'>and either saluted other. What tidings at Camelot? said the one. By my</a>
<a id='line_4082'>head, said the other, there have I been and espied the court of King</a>
<a id='line_4083'>Arthur, and there is such a fellowship they may never be broken, and</a>
<a id='line_4084'>well-nigh all the world holdeth with Arthur, for there is the flower of</a>
<a id='line_4085'>chivalry. Now for this cause I am riding into the north, to tell our</a>
<a id='line_4086'>chieftains of the fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur. As</a>
<a id='line_4087'>for that, said the other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that</a>
<a id='line_4088'>is the greatest poison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot will</a>
<a id='line_4089'>I with it, for we have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and well</a>
<a id='line_4090'>cherished, that shall poison King Arthur; for so he hath promised our</a>
<a id='line_4091'>chieftains, and received great gifts for to do it. Beware, said the</a>
<a id='line_4092'>other knight, of Merlin, for he knoweth all things by the devil’s</a>
<a id='line_4093'>craft. Therefore will I not let it, said the knight. And so they</a>
<a id='line_4094'>departed asunder. Anon after Pellinore made him ready, and his lady,</a>
<a id='line_4095'>[and] rode toward Camelot; and as they came by the well there as the</a>
<a id='line_4096'>wounded knight was and the lady, there he found the knight, and the</a>
<a id='line_4097'>lady eaten with lions or wild beasts, all save the head, wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_4098'>made great sorrow, and wept passing sore, and said, Alas! her life</a>
<a id='line_4099'>might I have saved; but I was so fierce in my quest, therefore I would</a>
<a id='line_4100'>not abide. Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady. I wot not, said</a>
<a id='line_4101'>Pellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her, for she was</a>
<a id='line_4102'>a passing fair lady and a young. Now, will ye do by mine advice? said</a>
<a id='line_4103'>the lady, take this knight and let him be buried in an hermitage, and</a>
<a id='line_4104'>then take the lady’s head and bear it with you unto Arthur. So King</a>
<a id='line_4105'>Pellinore took this dead knight on his shoulders, and brought him to</a>
<a id='line_4106'>the hermitage, and charged the hermit with the corpse, that service</a>
<a id='line_4107'>should be done for the soul; and take his harness for your pain. It</a>
<a id='line_4108'>shall be done, said the hermit, as I will answer unto God.</a>
<a id='line_4109'></a>
<a id='line_4110'></a>
<a id='line_4111'></a>
<a id='line_4112'>CHAPTER XV. How when he was come to Camelot he was sworn upon a book to</a>
<a id='line_4113'>tell the truth of his quest.</a>
<a id='line_4114'></a>
<a id='line_4115'>And therewith they departed, and came there as the head of the lady lay</a>
<a id='line_4116'>with a fair yellow hair that grieved King Pellinore passingly sore when</a>
<a id='line_4117'>he looked on it, for much he cast his heart on the visage. And so by</a>
<a id='line_4118'>noon they came to Camelot; and the king and the queen were passing fain</a>
<a id='line_4119'>of his coming to the court. And there he was made to swear upon the</a>
<a id='line_4120'>Four Evangelists, to tell the truth of his quest from the one to the</a>
<a id='line_4121'>other. Ah! Sir Pellinore, said Queen Guenever, ye were greatly to blame</a>
<a id='line_4122'>that ye saved not this lady’s life. Madam, said Pellinore, ye were</a>
<a id='line_4123'>greatly to blame an ye would not save your own life an ye might, but,</a>
<a id='line_4124'>save your pleasure, I was so furious in my quest that I would not</a>
<a id='line_4125'>abide, and that repenteth me, and shall the days of my life. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_4126'>said Merlin, ye ought sore to repent it, for that lady was your own</a>
<a id='line_4127'>daughter begotten on the lady of the Rule, and that knight that was</a>
<a id='line_4128'>dead was her love, and should have wedded her, and he was a right good</a>
<a id='line_4129'>knight of a young man, and would have proved a good man, and to this</a>
<a id='line_4130'>court was he coming, and his name was Sir Miles of the Launds, and a</a>
<a id='line_4131'>knight came behind him and slew him with a spear, and his name is</a>
<a id='line_4132'>Loraine le Savage, a false knight and a coward; and she for great</a>
<a id='line_4133'>sorrow and dole slew herself with his sword, and her name was Eleine.</a>
<a id='line_4134'>And because ye would not abide and help her, ye shall see your best</a>
<a id='line_4135'>friend fail you when ye be in the greatest distress that ever ye were</a>
<a id='line_4136'>or shall be. And that penance God hath ordained you for that deed, that</a>
<a id='line_4137'>he that ye shall most trust to of any man alive, he shall leave you</a>
<a id='line_4138'>there ye shall be slain. Me forthinketh, said King Pellinore, that this</a>
<a id='line_4139'>shall me betide, but God may fordo well destiny.</a>
<a id='line_4140'></a>
<a id='line_4141'>Thus, when the quest was done of the white hart, the which followed Sir</a>
<a id='line_4142'>Gawaine; and the quest of the brachet, followed of Sir Tor, Pellinore’s</a>
<a id='line_4143'>son; and the quest of the lady that the knight took away, the which</a>
<a id='line_4144'>King Pellinore at that time followed; then the king stablished all his</a>
<a id='line_4145'>knights, and them that were of lands not rich he gave them lands, and</a>
<a id='line_4146'>charged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always to flee</a>
<a id='line_4147'>treason; also, by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that</a>
<a id='line_4148'>asketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship of</a>
<a id='line_4149'>King Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels, and</a>
<a id='line_4150'>gentlewomen succour, upon pain of death. Also, that no man take no</a>
<a id='line_4151'>battles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, nor for no world’s goods.</a>
<a id='line_4152'>Unto this were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and</a>
<a id='line_4153'>young. And every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost.</a>

<a id='line_4165'></a>
<a id='line_4166'>So after these quests of Sir Gawaine, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore, it</a>
<a id='line_4167'>fell so that Merlin fell in a dotage on the damosel that King Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_4168'>brought to court, and she was one of the damosels of the lake, that</a>
<a id='line_4169'>hight Nimue. But Merlin would let her have no rest, but always he would</a>
<a id='line_4170'>be with her. And ever she made Merlin good cheer till she had learned</a>
<a id='line_4171'>of him all manner thing that she desired; and he was assotted upon her,</a>
<a id='line_4172'>that he might not be from her. So on a time he told King Arthur that he</a>
<a id='line_4173'>should not dure long, but for all his crafts he should be put in the</a>
<a id='line_4174'>earth quick. And so he told the king many things that should befall,</a>
<a id='line_4175'>but always he warned the king to keep well his sword and the scabbard,</a>
<a id='line_4176'>for he told him how the sword and the scabbard should be stolen by a</a>
<a id='line_4177'>woman from him that he most trusted. Also he told King Arthur that he</a>
<a id='line_4178'>should miss him,—Yet had ye liefer than all your lands to have me</a>
<a id='line_4179'>again. Ah, said the king, since ye know of your adventure, purvey for</a>
<a id='line_4180'>it, and put away by your crafts that misadventure. Nay, said Merlin, it</a>
<a id='line_4181'>will not be; so he departed from the king. And within a while the</a>
<a id='line_4182'>Damosel of the Lake departed, and Merlin went with her evermore</a>
<a id='line_4183'>wheresomever she went. And ofttimes Merlin would have had her privily</a>
<a id='line_4184'>away by his subtle crafts; then she made him to swear that he should</a>
<a id='line_4185'>never do none enchantment upon her if he would have his will. And so he</a>
<a id='line_4186'>sware; so she and Merlin went over the sea unto the land of Benwick,</a>
<a id='line_4187'>whereas King Ban was king that had great war against King Claudas, and</a>
<a id='line_4188'>there Merlin spake with King Ban’s wife, a fair lady and a good, and</a>
<a id='line_4189'>her name was Elaine, and there he saw young Launcelot. There the queen</a>
<a id='line_4190'>made great sorrow for the mortal war that King Claudas made on her lord</a>
<a id='line_4191'>and on her lands. Take none heaviness, said Merlin, for this same child</a>
<a id='line_4192'>within this twenty year shall revenge you on King Claudas, that all</a>
<a id='line_4193'>Christendom shall speak of it; and this same child shall be the most</a>
<a id='line_4194'>man of worship of the world, and his first name is Galahad, that know I</a>
<a id='line_4195'>well, said Merlin, and since ye have confirmed him Launcelot. That is</a>
<a id='line_4196'>truth, said the queen, his first name was Galahad. O Merlin, said the</a>
<a id='line_4197'>queen, shall I live to see my son such a man of prowess? Yea, lady, on</a>
<a id='line_4198'>my peril ye shall see it, and live many winters after.</a>
<a id='line_4199'></a>
<a id='line_4200'>And so, soon after, the lady and Merlin departed, and by the way Merlin</a>
<a id='line_4201'>showed her many wonders, and came into Cornwall. And always Merlin lay</a>
<a id='line_4202'>about the lady to have her maidenhood, and she was ever passing weary</a>
<a id='line_4203'>of him, and fain would have been delivered of him, for she was afeard</a>
<a id='line_4204'>of him because he was a devil’s son, and she could not beskift him by</a>
<a id='line_4205'>no mean. And so on a time it happed that Merlin showed to her in a rock</a>
<a id='line_4206'>whereas was a great wonder, and wrought by enchantment, that went under</a>
<a id='line_4207'>a great stone. So by her subtle working she made Merlin to go under</a>
<a id='line_4208'>that stone to let her wit of the marvels there; but she wrought so</a>
<a id='line_4209'>there for him that he came never out for all the craft he could do. And</a>
<a id='line_4210'>so she departed and left Merlin.</a>

<a id='line_4221'>Soleise, and the king of the Isle of Longtains, all these five kings</a>
<a id='line_4222'>with a great host were entered into the land of King Arthur, and burnt</a>
<a id='line_4223'>and slew clean afore them, both cities and castles, that it was pity to</a>
<a id='line_4224'>hear. Alas, said Arthur, yet had I never rest one month since I was</a>
<a id='line_4225'>crowned king of this land. Now shall I never rest till I meet with</a>
<a id='line_4226'>those kings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege</a>
<a id='line_4227'>people shall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will, and</a>
<a id='line_4228'>abide who that will. Then the king let write unto King Pellinore, and</a>
<a id='line_4229'>prayed him in all haste to make him ready with such people as he might</a>
<a id='line_4230'>lightliest rear and hie him after in all haste. All the barons were</a>
<a id='line_4231'>privily wroth that the king would depart so suddenly; but the king by</a>
<a id='line_4232'>no mean would abide, but made writing unto them that were not there,</a>
<a id='line_4233'>and bade them hie after him, such as were not at that time in the</a>
<a id='line_4234'>court. Then the king came to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you</a>
<a id='line_4235'>ready, for ye shall go with me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4236'>cause me to be the more hardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not</a>
<a id='line_4237'>wit my lady to be in no jeopardy. Sir, said she, I am at your</a>
<a id='line_4238'>commandment, and shall be ready what time so ye be ready. So on the</a>
<a id='line_4239'>morn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as they had,</a>
<a id='line_4240'>and came into the north, into a forest beside Humber, and there lodged</a>
<a id='line_4241'>them. When the word and tiding came unto the five kings above said,</a>
<a id='line_4242'>that Arthur was beside Humber in a forest, there was a knight, brother</a>
<a id='line_4243'>unto one of the five kings, that gave them this counsel: Ye know well</a>
<a id='line_4244'>that Sir Arthur hath the flower of chivalry of the world with him, as</a>
<a id='line_4245'>it is proved by the great battle he did with the eleven kings; and</a>
<a id='line_4246'>therefore hie unto him night and day till that we be nigh him, for the</a>
<a id='line_4247'>longer he tarrieth the bigger he is, and we ever the weaker; and he is</a>
<a id='line_4248'>so courageous of himself that he is come to the field with little</a>
<a id='line_4249'>people, and therefore let us set upon him or day and we shall slay</a>
<a id='line_4250'>down; of his knights there shall none escape.</a>
<a id='line_4251'></a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'></a>
<a id='line_4254'>CHAPTER III. How King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and</a>
<a id='line_4255'>slew the five kings and made the remnant to flee.</a>
<a id='line_4256'></a>
<a id='line_4257'>Unto this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth</a>
<a id='line_4258'>with their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and</a>
<a id='line_4259'>set upon his host as the king and his knights were in their pavilions.</a>
<a id='line_4260'>King Arthur was unarmed, and had laid him to rest with his Queen</a>
<a id='line_4261'>Guenever. Sir, said Sir Kay, it is not good we be unarmed. We shall</a>
<a id='line_4262'>have no need, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Griflet, that lay in a little</a>
<a id='line_4263'>pavilion by the king. With that they heard a great noise, and many</a>
<a id='line_4264'>cried, Treason, treason! Alas, said King Arthur, we be betrayed! Unto</a>
<a id='line_4265'>arms, fellows, then he cried. So they were armed anon at all points.</a>
<a id='line_4266'>Then came there a wounded knight unto the king, and said, Sir, save</a>
<a id='line_4267'>yourself and my lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much</a>
<a id='line_4268'>people of ours slain. So anon the king and the queen and the three</a>
<a id='line_4269'>knights took their horses, and rode toward Humber to pass over it, and</a>
<a id='line_4270'>the water was so rough that they were afraid to pass over. Now may ye</a>
<a id='line_4271'>choose, said King Arthur, whether ye will abide and take the adventure</a>
<a id='line_4272'>on this side, for an ye be taken they will slay you. It were me liefer,</a>
<a id='line_4273'>said the queen, to die in the water than to fall in your enemies’ hands</a>
<a id='line_4274'>and there be slain.</a>
<a id='line_4275'></a>
<a id='line_4276'>And as they stood so talking, Sir Kay saw the five kings coming on</a>
<a id='line_4277'>horseback by themselves alone, with their spears in their hands even</a>
<a id='line_4278'>toward them. Lo, said Sir Kay, yonder be the five kings; let us go to</a>
<a id='line_4279'>them and match them. That were folly, said Sir Gawaine, for we are but</a>
<a id='line_4280'>three and they be five. That is truth, said Sir Griflet. No force, said</a>
<a id='line_4281'>Sir Kay, I will undertake for two of them, and then may ye three</a>
<a id='line_4282'>undertake for the other three. And therewithal, Sir Kay let his horse</a>
<a id='line_4283'>run as fast as he might, and struck one of them through the shield and</a>
<a id='line_4284'>the body a fathom, that the king fell to the earth stark dead. That saw</a>
<a id='line_4285'>Sir Gawaine, and ran unto another king so hard that he smote him</a>
<a id='line_4286'>through the body. And therewithal King Arthur ran to another, and smote</a>
<a id='line_4287'>him through the body with a spear, that he fell to the earth dead. Then</a>
<a id='line_4288'>Sir Griflet ran unto the fourth king, and gave him such a fall that his</a>
<a id='line_4289'>neck brake. Anon Sir Kay ran unto the fifth king, and smote him so hard</a>
<a id='line_4290'>on the helm that the stroke clave the helm and the head to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4291'>That was well stricken, said King Arthur, and worshipfully hast thou</a>
<a id='line_4292'>holden thy promise, therefore I shall honour thee while that I live.</a>
<a id='line_4293'>And therewithal they set the queen in a barge into Humber; but always</a>
<a id='line_4294'>Queen Guenever praised Sir Kay for his deeds, and said, What lady that</a>
<a id='line_4295'>ye love, and she love you not again she were greatly to blame; and</a>
<a id='line_4296'>among ladies, said the queen, I shall bear your noble fame, for ye</a>
<a id='line_4297'>spake a great word, and fulfilled it worshipfully. And therewith the</a>
<a id='line_4298'>queen departed.</a>
<a id='line_4299'></a>
<a id='line_4300'>Then the king and the three knights rode into the forest, for there</a>
<a id='line_4301'>they supposed to hear of them that were escaped; and there he found the</a>
<a id='line_4302'>most part of his people, and told them all how the five kings were</a>
<a id='line_4303'>dead. And therefore let us hold us together till it be day, and when</a>
<a id='line_4304'>their host have espied that their chieftains be slain, they will make</a>
<a id='line_4305'>such dole that they shall no more help themselves. And right so as the</a>
<a id='line_4306'>king said, so it was; for when they found the five kings dead, they</a>
<a id='line_4307'>made such dole that they fell from their horses. Therewithal came King</a>
<a id='line_4308'>Arthur but with a few people, and slew on the left hand and on the</a>
<a id='line_4309'>right hand, that well-nigh there escaped no man, but all were slain to</a>
<a id='line_4310'>the number thirty thousand. And when the battle was all ended, the king</a>
<a id='line_4311'>kneeled down and thanked God meekly. And then he sent for the queen,</a>
<a id='line_4312'>and soon she was come, and she made great joy of the overcoming of that</a>
<a id='line_4313'>battle.</a>
<a id='line_4314'></a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'></a>
<a id='line_4317'>CHAPTER IV. How the battle was finished or he came, and how King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4318'>founded an abbey where the battle was.</a>
<a id='line_4319'></a>
<a id='line_4320'>Therewithal came one to King Arthur, and told him that King Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_4321'>was within three mile with a great host; and he said, Go unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_4322'>let him understand how we have sped. So within a while King Pellinore</a>
<a id='line_4323'>came with a great host, and saluted the people and the king, and there</a>
<a id='line_4324'>was great joy made on every side. Then the king let search how much</a>
<a id='line_4325'>people of his party there was slain; and there were found but little</a>
<a id='line_4326'>past two hundred men slain and eight knights of the Table Round in</a>
<a id='line_4327'>their pavilions. Then the king let rear and devise in the same place</a>
<a id='line_4328'>whereat the battle was done a fair abbey, and endowed it with great</a>
<a id='line_4329'>livelihood, and let it call the Abbey of La Beale Adventure. But when</a>
<a id='line_4330'>some of them came into their countries, whereof the five kings were</a>
<a id='line_4331'>kings, and told them how they were slain, there was made great dole.</a>
<a id='line_4332'>And all King Arthur’s enemies, as the King of North Wales, and the</a>
<a id='line_4333'>kings of the North, [when they] wist of the battle, they were passing</a>
<a id='line_4334'>heavy. And so the king returned unto Camelot in haste.</a>
<a id='line_4335'></a>
<a id='line_4336'>And when he was come to Camelot he called King Pellinore unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_4337'>said, Ye understand well that we have lost eight knights of the best of</a>
<a id='line_4338'>the Table Round, and by your advice we will choose eight again of the</a>
<a id='line_4339'>best we may find in this court. Sir, said Pellinore, I shall counsel</a>
<a id='line_4340'>you after my conceit the best: there are in your court full noble</a>
<a id='line_4341'>knights both of old and young; and therefore by mine advice ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4342'>choose half of the old and half of the young. Which be the old? said</a>
<a id='line_4343'>King Arthur. Sir, said King Pellinore, meseemeth that King Uriens that</a>
<a id='line_4344'>hath wedded your sister Morgan le Fay, and the King of the Lake, and</a>
<a id='line_4345'>Sir Hervise de Revel, a noble knight, and Sir Galagars, the fourth.</a>
<a id='line_4346'>This is well devised, said King Arthur, and right so shall it be. Now,</a>
<a id='line_4347'>which are the four young knights? said Arthur. Sir, said Pellinore, the</a>
<a id='line_4348'>first is Sir Gawaine, your nephew, that is as good a knight of his time</a>
<a id='line_4349'>as any is in this land; and the second as meseemeth best is Sir Griflet</a>
<a id='line_4350'>le Fise de Dieu, that is a good knight and full desirous in arms, and</a>
<a id='line_4351'>who may see him live he shall prove a good knight; and the third as</a>
<a id='line_4352'>meseemeth is well to be one of the knights of the Round Table, Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_4353'>the Seneschal, for many times he hath done full worshipfully, and now</a>
<a id='line_4354'>at your last battle he did full honourably for to undertake to slay two</a>
<a id='line_4355'>kings. By my head, said Arthur, he is best worth to be a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_4356'>Round Table of any that ye have rehearsed, an he had done no more</a>
<a id='line_4357'>prowess in his life days.</a>
<a id='line_4358'></a>
<a id='line_4359'></a>
<a id='line_4360'></a>
<a id='line_4361'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Tor was made knight of the Round Table, and how</a>
<a id='line_4362'>Bagdemagus was displeased.</a>
<a id='line_4363'></a>
<a id='line_4364'>Now, said King Pellinore, I shall put to you two knights, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4365'>choose which is most worthy, that is Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Tor, my</a>
<a id='line_4366'>son. But because Sir Tor is my son I may not praise him, but else, an</a>
<a id='line_4367'>he were not my son, I durst say that of his age there is not in this</a>
<a id='line_4368'>land a better knight than he is, nor of better conditions and loath to</a>
<a id='line_4369'>do any wrong, and loath to take any wrong. By my head, said Arthur, he</a>
<a id='line_4370'>is a passing good knight as any ye spake of this day, that wot I well,</a>
<a id='line_4371'>said the king; for I have seen him proved, but he saith little and he</a>
<a id='line_4372'>doth much more, for I know none in all this court an he were as well</a>
<a id='line_4373'>born on his mother’s side as he is on your side, that is like him of</a>
<a id='line_4374'>prowess and of might: and therefore I will have him at this time, and</a>
<a id='line_4375'>leave Sir Bagdemagus till another time. So when they were so chosen by</a>
<a id='line_4376'>the assent of all the barons, so were there found in their sieges every</a>
<a id='line_4377'>knights’ names that here are rehearsed, and so were they set in their</a>
<a id='line_4378'>sieges; whereof Sir Bagdemagus was wonderly wroth, that Sir Tor was</a>
<a id='line_4379'>advanced afore him, and therefore suddenly he departed from the court,</a>
<a id='line_4380'>and took his squire with him, and rode long in a forest till they came</a>
<a id='line_4381'>to a cross, and there alighted and said his prayers devoutly. The</a>
<a id='line_4382'>meanwhile his squire found written upon the cross, that Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_4383'>should never return unto the court again, till he had won a knight’s</a>
<a id='line_4384'>body of the Round Table, body for body. So, sir, said the squire, here</a>
<a id='line_4385'>I find writing of you, therefore I rede you return again to the court.</a>
<a id='line_4386'>That shall I never, said Bagdemagus, till men speak of me great</a>
<a id='line_4387'>worship, and that I be worthy to be a knight of the Round Table. And so</a>
<a id='line_4388'>he rode forth, and there by the way he found a branch of an holy herb</a>
<a id='line_4389'>that was the sign of the Sangreal, and no knight found such tokens but</a>
<a id='line_4390'>he were a good liver.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>So, as Sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures, it happed him to</a>
<a id='line_4393'>come to the rock whereas the Lady of the Lake had put Merlin under the</a>
<a id='line_4394'>stone, and there he heard him make great dole; whereof Sir Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_4395'>would have holpen him, and went unto the great stone, and it was so</a>
<a id='line_4396'>heavy that an hundred men might not lift it up. When Merlin wist he was</a>
<a id='line_4397'>there, he bade leave his labour, for all was in vain, for he might</a>
<a id='line_4398'>never be holpen but by her that put him there. And so Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_4399'>departed and did many adventures, and proved after a full good knight,</a>
<a id='line_4400'>and came again to the court and was made knight of the Round Table. So</a>
<a id='line_4401'>on the morn there fell new tidings and other adventures.</a>
<a id='line_4402'></a>
<a id='line_4403'></a>
<a id='line_4404'></a>
<a id='line_4405'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul,</a>
<a id='line_4406'>chased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.</a>
<a id='line_4407'></a>
<a id='line_4408'>Then it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode a-hunting into</a>
<a id='line_4409'>a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4410'>of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were well horsed, and so</a>
<a id='line_4411'>they chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten mile</a>
<a id='line_4412'>from their fellowship. And at the last they chased so sore that they</a>
<a id='line_4413'>slew their horses underneath them. Then were they all three on foot,</a>
<a id='line_4414'>and ever they saw the hart afore them passing weary and enbushed. What</a>
<a id='line_4415'>will we do? said King Arthur, we are hard bestead. Let us go on foot,</a>
<a id='line_4416'>said King Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging. Then were they</a>
<a id='line_4417'>ware of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting</a>
<a id='line_4418'>on his throat, and more other hounds came after. Then King Arthur blew</a>
<a id='line_4419'>the prise and dight the hart.</a>
<a id='line_4420'></a>
<a id='line_4421'>Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a great</a>
<a id='line_4422'>water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the water, and</a>
<a id='line_4423'>the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands. Then Arthur went</a>
<a id='line_4424'>to the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly creature therein. Sirs,</a>
<a id='line_4425'>said the king, come thence, and let us see what is in this ship. So</a>
<a id='line_4426'>they went in all three, and found it richly behanged with cloth of</a>
<a id='line_4427'>silk. By then it was dark night, and there suddenly were about them an</a>
<a id='line_4428'>hundred torches set upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave</a>
<a id='line_4429'>great light; and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and</a>
<a id='line_4430'>saluted King Arthur on their knees, and called him by his name, and</a>
<a id='line_4431'>said he was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have of</a>
<a id='line_4432'>the best. The king thanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and</a>
<a id='line_4433'>his two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly</a>
<a id='line_4434'>beseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served of</a>
<a id='line_4435'>all wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had great</a>
<a id='line_4436'>marvel, for he fared never better in his life as for one supper. And so</a>
<a id='line_4437'>when they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a</a>
<a id='line_4438'>chamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King</a>
<a id='line_4439'>Uriens served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was</a>
<a id='line_4440'>led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so they</a>
<a id='line_4441'>were laid in their beds easily. And anon they fell asleep, and slept</a>
<a id='line_4442'>marvellously sore all the night. And on the morrow King Uriens was in</a>
<a id='line_4443'>Camelot abed in his wife’s arms, Morgan le Fay. And when he awoke he</a>
<a id='line_4444'>had great marvel, how he came there, for on the even afore he was two</a>
<a id='line_4445'>days’ journey from Camelot. And when King Arthur awoke he found himself</a>
<a id='line_4446'>in a dark prison, hearing about him many complaints of woful knights.</a>
<a id='line_4447'></a>
<a id='line_4448'></a>
<a id='line_4449'></a>
<a id='line_4450'>CHAPTER VII. How Arthur took upon him to fight to be delivered out of</a>
<a id='line_4451'>prison, and also for to deliver twenty knights that were in prison.</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>What are ye that so complain? said King Arthur. We be here twenty</a>
<a id='line_4454'>knights, prisoners, said they, and some of us have lain here seven</a>
<a id='line_4455'>year, and some more and some less. For what cause? said Arthur. We</a>
<a id='line_4456'>shall tell you, said the knights; this lord of this castle, his name is</a>
<a id='line_4457'>Sir Damas, and he is the falsest knight that liveth, and full of</a>
<a id='line_4458'>treason, and a very coward as any liveth, and he hath a younger</a>
<a id='line_4459'>brother, a good knight of prowess, his name is Sir Ontzlake; and this</a>
<a id='line_4460'>traitor Damas, the elder brother will give him no part of his</a>
<a id='line_4461'>livelihood, but as Sir Ontzlake keepeth thorough prowess of his hands,</a>
<a id='line_4462'>and so he keepeth from him a full fair manor and a rich, and therein</a>
<a id='line_4463'>Sir Ontzlake dwelleth worshipfully, and is well beloved of all people.</a>
<a id='line_4464'>And this Sir Damas, our master is as evil beloved, for he is without</a>
<a id='line_4465'>mercy, and he is a coward, and great war hath been betwixt them both,</a>
<a id='line_4466'>but Ontzlake hath ever the better, and ever he proffereth Sir Damas to</a>
<a id='line_4467'>fight for the livelihood, body for body, but he will not do; other-else</a>
<a id='line_4468'>to find a knight to fight for him. Unto that Sir Damas had granted to</a>
<a id='line_4469'>find a knight, but he is so evil beloved and hated, that there is never</a>
<a id='line_4470'>a knight will fight for him. And when Damas saw this, that there was</a>
<a id='line_4471'>never a knight would fight for him, he hath daily lain await with many</a>
<a id='line_4472'>knights with him, and taken all the knights in this country to see and</a>
<a id='line_4473'>espy their adventures, he hath taken them by force and brought them to</a>
<a id='line_4474'>his prison. And so he took us separately as we rode on our adventures,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>and many good knights have died in this prison for hunger, to the</a>
<a id='line_4476'>number of eighteen knights; and if any of us all that here is, or hath</a>
<a id='line_4477'>been, would have foughten with his brother Ontzlake, he would have</a>
<a id='line_4478'>delivered us, but for because this Damas is so false and so full of</a>
<a id='line_4479'>treason we would never fight for him to die for it. And we be so lean</a>
<a id='line_4480'>for hunger that unnethe we may stand on our feet. God deliver you, for</a>
<a id='line_4481'>his mercy, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4482'></a>
<a id='line_4483'>Anon, therewithal there came a damosel unto Arthur, and asked him, What</a>
<a id='line_4484'>cheer? I cannot say, said he. Sir, said she, an ye will fight for my</a>
<a id='line_4485'>lord, ye shall be delivered out of prison, and else ye escape never the</a>
<a id='line_4486'>life. Now, said Arthur, that is hard, yet had I liefer to fight with a</a>
<a id='line_4487'>knight than to die in prison; with this, said Arthur, I may be</a>
<a id='line_4488'>delivered and all these prisoners, I will do the battle. Yes, said the</a>
<a id='line_4489'>damosel. I am ready, said Arthur, an I had horse and armour. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4490'>lack none, said the damosel. Meseemeth, damosel, I should have seen you</a>
<a id='line_4491'>in the court of Arthur. Nay said the damosel, I came never there, I am</a>
<a id='line_4492'>the lord’s daughter of this castle. Yet was she false, for she was one</a>
<a id='line_4493'>of the damosels of Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_4494'></a>
<a id='line_4495'>Anon she went unto Sir Damas, and told him how he would do battle for</a>
<a id='line_4496'>him, and so he sent for Arthur. And when he came he was well coloured,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>and well made of his limbs, that all knights that saw him said it were</a>
<a id='line_4498'>pity that such a knight should die in prison. So Sir Damas and he were</a>
<a id='line_4499'>agreed that he should fight for him upon this covenant, that all other</a>
<a id='line_4500'>knights should be delivered; and unto that was Sir Damas sworn unto</a>
<a id='line_4501'>Arthur, and also to do the battle to the uttermost. And with that all</a>
<a id='line_4502'>the twenty knights were brought out of the dark prison into the hall,</a>
<a id='line_4503'>and delivered, and so they all abode to see the battle.</a>
<a id='line_4504'></a>
<a id='line_4505'></a>
<a id='line_4506'></a>
<a id='line_4507'>CHAPTER VIII. How Accolon found himself by a well, and he took upon him</a>
<a id='line_4508'>to do battle against Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4509'></a>
<a id='line_4510'>Now turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he awoke he found himself</a>
<a id='line_4511'>by a deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of death. And</a>
<a id='line_4512'>there came out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out of that pipe</a>
<a id='line_4513'>ran water all on high in a stone of marble. When Sir Accolon saw this,</a>
<a id='line_4514'>he blessed him and said, Jesus save my lord King Arthur, and King</a>
<a id='line_4515'>Uriens, for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were</a>
<a id='line_4516'>devils and no women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall</a>
<a id='line_4517'>destroy all where I may find these false damosels that use</a>
<a id='line_4518'>enchantments. Right with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and</a>
<a id='line_4519'>a flat nose, and saluted Sir Accolon, and said how he came from Queen</a>
<a id='line_4520'>Morgan le Fay, and she greeteth you well, and biddeth you be of strong</a>
<a id='line_4521'>heart, for ye shall fight to morrow with a knight at the hour of prime,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>and therefore she hath sent you here Excalibur, Arthur’s sword, and the</a>
<a id='line_4523'>scabbard, and she biddeth you as ye love her, that ye do the battle to</a>
<a id='line_4524'>the uttermost, without any mercy, like as ye had promised her when ye</a>
<a id='line_4525'>spake together in privity; and what damosel that bringeth her the</a>
<a id='line_4526'>knight’s head, which ye shall fight withal, she will make her a queen.</a>
<a id='line_4527'>Now I understand you well, said Accolon, I shall hold that I have</a>
<a id='line_4528'>promised her now I have the sword: when saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_4529'>Fay? Right late, said the dwarf. Then Accolon took him in his arms and</a>
<a id='line_4530'>said, Recommend me unto my lady queen, and tell her all shall be done</a>
<a id='line_4531'>that I have promised her, and else I will die for it. Now I suppose,</a>
<a id='line_4532'>said Accolon, she hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this</a>
<a id='line_4533'>battle. Ye may well believe it, said the dwarf. Right so there came a</a>
<a id='line_4534'>knight and a lady with six squires, and saluted Accolon, and prayed him</a>
<a id='line_4535'>for to arise, and come and rest him at his manor. And so Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4536'>mounted upon a void horse, and went with the knight unto a fair manor</a>
<a id='line_4537'>by a priory, and there he had passing good cheer.</a>
<a id='line_4538'></a>
<a id='line_4539'>Then Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade make him</a>
<a id='line_4540'>ready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight</a>
<a id='line_4541'>with a good knight, for he had found a good knight that was ready to do</a>
<a id='line_4542'>battle at all points. When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he was</a>
<a id='line_4543'>passing heavy, for he was wounded a little to-fore through both his</a>
<a id='line_4544'>thighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as he was wounded, he</a>
<a id='line_4545'>would have taken the battle on hand. So it happed at that time, by the</a>
<a id='line_4546'>means of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when</a>
<a id='line_4547'>he heard of that battle, and how Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he</a>
<a id='line_4548'>would fight for him. Because Morgan le Fay had sent him Excalibur and</a>
<a id='line_4549'>the sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn: this was the cause</a>
<a id='line_4550'>Sir Accolon took the battle on hand. Then Sir Ontzlake was passing</a>
<a id='line_4551'>glad, and thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart that he would do so</a>
<a id='line_4552'>much for him. And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his brother</a>
<a id='line_4553'>Sir Damas, that he had a knight that for him should be ready in the</a>
<a id='line_4554'>field by the hour of prime.</a>
<a id='line_4555'></a>
<a id='line_4556'>So on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_4557'>Damas, When shall we to the field? Sir, said Sir Damas, ye shall hear</a>
<a id='line_4558'>mass. And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done there came a</a>
<a id='line_4559'>squire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready,</a>
<a id='line_4560'>for our knight is ready in the field. Then Sir Arthur mounted upon</a>
<a id='line_4561'>horseback, and there were all the knights and commons of that country;</a>
<a id='line_4562'>and so by all advices there were chosen twelve good men of the country</a>
<a id='line_4563'>for to wait upon the two knights. And right as Arthur was on horseback</a>
<a id='line_4564'>there came a damosel from Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur a</a>
<a id='line_4565'>sword like unto Excalibur, and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_4566'>Morgan le Fay sendeth here your sword for great love. And he thanked</a>
<a id='line_4567'>her, and weened it had been so, but she was false, for the sword and</a>
<a id='line_4568'>the scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.</a>
<a id='line_4569'></a>
<a id='line_4570'></a>
<a id='line_4571'></a>
<a id='line_4572'>CHAPTER IX. Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.</a>
<a id='line_4573'></a>
<a id='line_4574'>And then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let their</a>
<a id='line_4575'>horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield</a>
<a id='line_4576'>with their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_4577'>then they started up both, and pulled out their swords. The meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_4578'>that they were thus at the battle, came the Damosel of the Lake into</a>
<a id='line_4579'>the field, that put Merlin under the stone; and she came thither for</a>
<a id='line_4580'>love of King Arthur, for she knew how Morgan le Fay had so ordained</a>
<a id='line_4581'>that King Arthur should have been slain that day, and therefore she</a>
<a id='line_4582'>came to save his life. And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave</a>
<a id='line_4583'>many great strokes, but always Arthur’s sword bit not like Accolon’s</a>
<a id='line_4584'>sword; but for the most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded</a>
<a id='line_4585'>sore Arthur, that it was marvel he stood, and always his blood fell</a>
<a id='line_4586'>from him fast.</a>
<a id='line_4587'></a>
<a id='line_4588'>When Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed, and then</a>
<a id='line_4589'>he deemed treason that his sword was changed; for his sword bit not</a>
<a id='line_4590'>steel as it was wont to do, therefore he dreaded him sore to be dead,</a>
<a id='line_4591'>for ever him seemed that the sword in Accolon’s hand was Excalibur, for</a>
<a id='line_4592'>at every stroke that Accolon struck he drew blood on Arthur. Now,</a>
<a id='line_4593'>knight, said Accolon unto Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4594'>answered not again, and gave him such a buffet on the helm that it made</a>
<a id='line_4595'>him to stoop, nigh falling down to the earth. Then Sir Accolon withdrew</a>
<a id='line_4596'>him a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4597'>such a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth. Then were they wroth</a>
<a id='line_4598'>both, and gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir Arthur lost</a>
<a id='line_4599'>so much blood that it was marvel he stood on his feet, but he was so</a>
<a id='line_4600'>full of knighthood that knightly he endured the pain. And Sir Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4601'>lost not a deal of blood, therefore he waxed passing light, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_4602'>Arthur was passing feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for all</a>
<a id='line_4603'>that he made countenance as though he might endure, and held Accolon as</a>
<a id='line_4604'>short as he might. But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that he</a>
<a id='line_4605'>waxed passing hardy. But all men that beheld him said they saw never</a>
<a id='line_4606'>knight fight so well as Arthur did considering the blood that he bled.</a>
<a id='line_4607'>So was all the people sorry for him, but the two brethren would not</a>
<a id='line_4608'>accord. Then always they fought together as fierce knights, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_4609'>Arthur withdrew him a little for to rest him, and Sir Accolon called</a>
<a id='line_4610'>him to battle and said, It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest.</a>
<a id='line_4611'>And therewith he came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth</a>
<a id='line_4612'>for the blood that he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the</a>
<a id='line_4613'>helm, so mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_4614'>therewith Arthur’s sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass</a>
<a id='line_4615'>among the blood, and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his</a>
<a id='line_4616'>hands. When Sir Arthur saw that, he was in great fear to die, but</a>
<a id='line_4617'>always he held up his shield and lost no ground, nor bated no cheer.</a>
<a id='line_4618'></a>
<a id='line_4619'></a>
<a id='line_4620'></a>
<a id='line_4621'>CHAPTER X. How King Arthur’s sword that he fought with brake, and how</a>
<a id='line_4622'>he recovered of Accolon his own sword Excalibur, and overcame his</a>
<a id='line_4623'>enemy.</a>
<a id='line_4624'></a>
<a id='line_4625'>Then Sir Accolon began with words of treason, and said, Knight, thou</a>
<a id='line_4626'>art overcome, and mayst not endure, and also thou art weaponless, and</a>
<a id='line_4627'>thou hast lost much of thy blood, and I am full loath to slay thee,</a>
<a id='line_4628'>therefore yield thee to me as recreant. Nay, said Sir Arthur, I may not</a>
<a id='line_4629'>so, for I have promised to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith</a>
<a id='line_4630'>of my body, while me lasteth the life, and therefore I had liefer to</a>
<a id='line_4631'>die with honour than to live with shame; and if it were possible for me</a>
<a id='line_4632'>to die an hundred times, I had liefer to die so oft than yield me to</a>
<a id='line_4633'>thee; for though I lack weapon, I shall lack no worship, and if thou</a>
<a id='line_4634'>slay me weaponless that shall be thy shame. Well, said Accolon, as for</a>
<a id='line_4635'>the shame I will not spare, now keep thee from me, for thou art but a</a>
<a id='line_4636'>dead man. And therewith Accolon gave him such a stroke that he fell</a>
<a id='line_4637'>nigh to the earth, and would have had Arthur to have cried him mercy.</a>
<a id='line_4638'>But Sir Arthur pressed unto Accolon with his shield, and gave him with</a>
<a id='line_4639'>the pommel in his hand such a buffet that he went three strides aback.</a>
<a id='line_4640'></a>
<a id='line_4641'>When the Damosel of the Lake beheld Arthur, how full of prowess his</a>
<a id='line_4642'>body was, and the false treason that was wrought for him to have had</a>
<a id='line_4643'>him slain, she had great pity that so good a knight and such a man of</a>
<a id='line_4644'>worship should so be destroyed. And at the next stroke Sir Accolon</a>
<a id='line_4645'>struck him such a stroke that by the damosel’s enchantment the sword</a>
<a id='line_4646'>Excalibur fell out of Accolon’s hand to the earth. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_4647'>Arthur lightly leapt to it, and gat it in his hand, and forthwithal he</a>
<a id='line_4648'>knew that it was his sword Excalibur, and said, Thou hast been from me</a>
<a id='line_4649'>all too long, and much damage hast thou done me; and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_4650'>espied the scabbard hanging by his side, and suddenly he sterte to him</a>
<a id='line_4651'>and pulled the scabbard from him, and threw it from him as far as he</a>
<a id='line_4652'>might throw it. O knight, said Arthur, this day hast thou done me great</a>
<a id='line_4653'>damage with this sword; now are ye come unto your death, for I shall</a>
<a id='line_4654'>not warrant you but ye shall as well be rewarded with this sword, or</a>
<a id='line_4655'>ever we depart, as thou hast rewarded me; for much pain have ye made me</a>
<a id='line_4656'>to endure, and much blood have I lost. And therewith Sir Arthur rushed</a>
<a id='line_4657'>on him with all his might and pulled him to the earth, and then rushed</a>
<a id='line_4658'>off his helm, and gave him such a buffet on the head that the blood</a>
<a id='line_4659'>came out at his ears, his nose, and his mouth. Now will I slay thee,</a>
<a id='line_4660'>said Arthur. Slay me ye may well, said Accolon, an it please you, for</a>
<a id='line_4661'>ye are the best knight that ever I found, and I see well that God is</a>
<a id='line_4662'>with you. But for I promised to do this battle, said Accolon, to the</a>
<a id='line_4663'>uttermost, and never to be recreant while I lived, therefore shall I</a>
<a id='line_4664'>never yield me with my mouth, but God do with my body what he will.</a>
<a id='line_4665'>Then Sir Arthur remembered him, and thought he should have seen this</a>
<a id='line_4666'>knight. Now tell me, said Arthur, or I will slay thee, of what country</a>
<a id='line_4667'>art thou, and of what court? Sir Knight, said Sir Accolon, I am of the</a>
<a id='line_4668'>court of King Arthur, and my name is Accolon of Gaul. Then was Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4669'>more dismayed than he was beforehand; for then he remembered him of his</a>
<a id='line_4670'>sister Morgan le Fay, and of the enchantment of the ship. O sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_4671'>said he, I pray you tell me who gave you this sword, and by whom ye had</a>
<a id='line_4672'>it.</a>
<a id='line_4673'></a>
<a id='line_4674'></a>
<a id='line_4675'></a>
<a id='line_4676'>CHAPTER XI. How Accolon confessed the treason of Morgan le Fay, King</a>
<a id='line_4677'>Arthur’s sister, and how she would have done slay him.</a>
<a id='line_4678'></a>
<a id='line_4679'>Then Sir Accolon bethought him, and said, Woe worth this sword, for by</a>
<a id='line_4680'>it have I got my death. It may well be, said the king. Now, sir, said</a>
<a id='line_4681'>Accolon, I will tell you; this sword hath been in my keeping the most</a>
<a id='line_4682'>part of this twelvemonth; and Morgan le Fay, King Uriens’ wife, sent it</a>
<a id='line_4683'>me yesterday by a dwarf, to this intent, that I should slay King</a>
<a id='line_4684'>Arthur, her brother. For ye shall understand King Arthur is the man in</a>
<a id='line_4685'>the world that she most hateth, because he is most of worship and of</a>
<a id='line_4686'>prowess of any of her blood; also she loveth me out of measure as</a>
<a id='line_4687'>paramour, and I her again; and if she might bring about to slay Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4688'>by her crafts, she would slay her husband King Uriens lightly, and then</a>
<a id='line_4689'>had she me devised to be king in this land, and so to reign, and she to</a>
<a id='line_4690'>be my queen; but that is now done, said Accolon, for I am sure of my</a>
<a id='line_4691'>death. Well, said Sir Arthur, I feel by you ye would have been king in</a>
<a id='line_4692'>this land. It had been great damage to have destroyed your lord, said</a>
<a id='line_4693'>Arthur. It is truth, said Accolon, but now I have told you truth,</a>
<a id='line_4694'>wherefore I pray you tell me of whence ye are, and of what court? O</a>
<a id='line_4695'>Accolon, said King Arthur, now I let thee wit that I am King Arthur, to</a>
<a id='line_4696'>whom thou hast done great damage. When Accolon heard that he cried</a>
<a id='line_4697'>aloud, Fair, sweet lord, have mercy on me, for I knew not you. O Sir</a>
<a id='line_4698'>Accolon, said King Arthur, mercy shalt thou have, because I feel by thy</a>
<a id='line_4699'>words at this time thou knewest not my person; but I understand well by</a>
<a id='line_4700'>thy words that thou hast agreed to the death of my person, and</a>
<a id='line_4701'>therefore thou art a traitor; but I wite thee the less, for my sister</a>
<a id='line_4702'>Morgan le Fay by her false crafts made thee to agree and consent to her</a>
<a id='line_4703'>false lusts, but I shall be sore avenged upon her an I live, that all</a>
<a id='line_4704'>Christendom shall speak of it; God knoweth I have honoured her and</a>
<a id='line_4705'>worshipped her more than all my kin, and more have I trusted her than</a>
<a id='line_4706'>mine own wife and all my kin after.</a>
<a id='line_4707'></a>
<a id='line_4708'>Then Sir Arthur called the keepers of the field, and said, Sirs, come</a>
<a id='line_4709'>hither, for here are we two knights that have fought unto a great</a>
<a id='line_4710'>damage unto us both, and like each one of us to have slain other, if it</a>
<a id='line_4711'>had happed so; and had any of us known other, here had been no battle,</a>
<a id='line_4712'>nor stroke stricken. Then all aloud cried Accolon unto all the knights</a>
<a id='line_4713'>and men that were then there gathered together, and said to them in</a>
<a id='line_4714'>this manner, O lords, this noble knight that I have fought withal, the</a>
<a id='line_4715'>which me sore repenteth, is the most man of prowess, of manhood, and of</a>
<a id='line_4716'>worship in the world, for it is himself King Arthur, our alther liege</a>
<a id='line_4717'>lord, and with mishap and with misadventure have I done this battle</a>
<a id='line_4718'>with the king and lord that I am holden withal.</a>

<a id='line_4720'></a>
<a id='line_4721'></a>
<a id='line_4722'>CHAPTER XII. How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the</a>
<a id='line_4723'>twenty knights, and how Sir Accolon died.</a>
<a id='line_4724'></a>
<a id='line_4725'>Then all the people fell down on their knees and cried King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4726'>mercy. Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see what</a>
<a id='line_4727'>adventures befall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have fought</a>
<a id='line_4728'>with a knight of mine own unto my great damage and his both. But, sirs,</a>
<a id='line_4729'>because I am sore hurt, and he both, and I had great need of a little</a>
<a id='line_4730'>rest, ye shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren: As to</a>
<a id='line_4731'>thee, Sir Damas, for whom I have been champion and won the field of</a>
<a id='line_4732'>this knight, yet will I judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called an</a>
<a id='line_4733'>orgulous knight, and full of villainy, and not worth of prowess your</a>
<a id='line_4734'>deeds, therefore I will that ye give unto your brother all the whole</a>
<a id='line_4735'>manor with the appurtenance, under this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold</a>
<a id='line_4736'>the manor of you, and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon, for</a>
<a id='line_4737'>that will become you better to ride on than upon a courser. Also I</a>
<a id='line_4738'>charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never distress no</a>
<a id='line_4739'>knights errant that ride on their adventure. And also that thou restore</a>
<a id='line_4740'>these twenty knights that thou hast long kept prisoners, of all their</a>
<a id='line_4741'>harness, that they be content for; and if any of them come to my court</a>
<a id='line_4742'>and complain of thee, by my head thou shalt die therefore. Also, Sir</a>
<a id='line_4743'>Ontzlake, as to you, because ye are named a good knight, and full of</a>
<a id='line_4744'>prowess, and true and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be your</a>
<a id='line_4745'>charge I will give you, that in all goodly haste ye come unto me and my</a>
<a id='line_4746'>court, and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be</a>
<a id='line_4747'>thereafter I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in</a>
<a id='line_4748'>short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_4749'>Damas. God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty, I</a>
<a id='line_4750'>shall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment; for, sir,</a>
<a id='line_4751'>said Sir Ontzlake, as God would, as I was hurt but late with an</a>
<a id='line_4752'>adventurous knight through both my thighs, that grieved me sore, and</a>
<a id='line_4753'>else had I done this battle with you. God would, said Arthur, it had</a>
<a id='line_4754'>been so, for then had not I been hurt as I am. I shall tell you the</a>
<a id='line_4755'>cause why: for I had not been hurt as I am, had it not been mine own</a>
<a id='line_4756'>sword, that was stolen from me by treason; and this battle was ordained</a>
<a id='line_4757'>aforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to the purpose by</a>
<a id='line_4758'>false treason, and by false enchantment. Alas, said Sir Ontzlake, that</a>
<a id='line_4759'>is great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are of your deeds and</a>
<a id='line_4760'>prowess, that any man or woman might find in their hearts to work any</a>
<a id='line_4761'>treason against you. I shall reward them, said Arthur, in short time,</a>
<a id='line_4762'>by the grace of God. Now, tell me, said Arthur, how far am I from</a>
<a id='line_4763'>Camelot? Sir, ye are two days’ journey therefrom. I would fain be at</a>
<a id='line_4764'>some place of worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_4765'>Sir Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders’ foundation, of</a>
<a id='line_4766'>nuns, but three miles hence. So the king took his leave of all the</a>
<a id='line_4767'>people, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. And when</a>
<a id='line_4768'>they were come to the abbey, he let fetch leeches and search his wounds</a>
<a id='line_4769'>and Accolon’s both; but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he had</a>
<a id='line_4770'>bled so much blood that he might not live, but King Arthur was well</a>
<a id='line_4771'>recovered. So when Accolon was dead he let send him on an horse-bier</a>
<a id='line_4772'>with six knights unto Camelot, and said: Bear him to my sister Morgan</a>
<a id='line_4773'>le Fay, and say that I send her him to a present, and tell her I have</a>
<a id='line_4774'>my sword Excalibur and the scabbard; so they departed with the body.</a>

<a id='line_4780'></a>
<a id='line_4781'>The meanwhile Morgan le Fay had weened King Arthur had been dead. So on</a>
<a id='line_4782'>a day she espied King Uriens lay in his bed sleeping. Then she called</a>
<a id='line_4783'>unto her a maiden of her counsel, and said, Go fetch me my lord’s</a>
<a id='line_4784'>sword, for I saw never better time to slay him than now. O madam, said</a>
<a id='line_4785'>the damosel, an ye slay my lord ye can never escape. Care not you, said</a>
<a id='line_4786'>Morgan le Fay, for now I see my time in the which it is best to do it,</a>
<a id='line_4787'>and therefore hie thee fast and fetch me the sword. Then the damosel</a>
<a id='line_4788'>departed, and found Sir Uwaine sleeping upon a bed in another chamber,</a>
<a id='line_4789'>so she went unto Sir Uwaine, and awaked him, and bade him, Arise, and</a>
<a id='line_4790'>wait on my lady your mother, for she will slay the king your father</a>
<a id='line_4791'>sleeping in his bed, for I go to fetch his sword. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4792'>Uwaine, go on your way, and let me deal. Anon the damosel brought</a>
<a id='line_4793'>Morgan the sword with quaking hands, and she lightly took the sword,</a>
<a id='line_4794'>and pulled it out, and went boldly unto the bed’s side, and awaited how</a>
<a id='line_4795'>and where she might slay him best. And as she lifted up the sword to</a>
<a id='line_4796'>smite, Sir Uwaine leapt unto his mother, and caught her by the hand,</a>
<a id='line_4797'>and said, Ah, fiend, what wilt thou do? An thou wert not my mother,</a>
<a id='line_4798'>with this sword I should smite off thy head. Ah, said Sir Uwaine, men</a>
<a id='line_4799'>saith that Merlin was begotten of a devil, but I may say an earthly</a>
<a id='line_4800'>devil bare me. O fair son, Uwaine, have mercy upon me, I was tempted</a>
<a id='line_4801'>with a devil, wherefore I cry thee mercy; I will never more do so; and</a>
<a id='line_4802'>save my worship and discover me not. On this covenant, said Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_4803'>I will forgive it you, so ye will never be about to do such deeds. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_4804'>son, said she, and that I make you assurance.</a>

<a id='line_4809'>Accolon, and how she stole away the scabbard from Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4810'></a>
<a id='line_4811'>Then came tidings unto Morgan le Fay that Accolon was dead, and his</a>
<a id='line_4812'>body brought unto the church, and how King Arthur had his sword again.</a>
<a id='line_4813'>But when Queen Morgan wist that Accolon was dead, she was so sorrowful</a>
<a id='line_4814'>that near her heart to-brast. But because she would not it were known,</a>
<a id='line_4815'>outward she kept her countenance, and made no semblant of sorrow. But</a>
<a id='line_4816'>well she wist an she abode till her brother Arthur came thither, there</a>
<a id='line_4817'>should no gold go for her life.</a>
<a id='line_4818'></a>
<a id='line_4819'>Then she went unto Queen Guenever, and asked her leave to ride into the</a>
<a id='line_4820'>country. Ye may abide, said Queen Guenever, till your brother the king</a>
<a id='line_4821'>come home. I may not, said Morgan le Fay, for I have such hasty</a>
<a id='line_4822'>tidings, that I may not tarry. Well, said Guenever, ye may depart when</a>
<a id='line_4823'>ye will. So early on the morn, or it was day, she took her horse and</a>
<a id='line_4824'>rode all that day and most part of the night, and on the morn by noon</a>
<a id='line_4825'>she came to the same abbey of nuns whereas lay King Arthur; and she</a>
<a id='line_4826'>knowing he was there, she asked where he was. And they answered how he</a>
<a id='line_4827'>had laid him in his bed to sleep, for he had had but little rest these</a>
<a id='line_4828'>three nights. Well, said she, I charge you that none of you awake him</a>
<a id='line_4829'>till I do, and then she alighted off her horse, and thought for to</a>
<a id='line_4830'>steal away Excalibur his sword, and so she went straight unto his</a>
<a id='line_4831'>chamber, and no man durst disobey her commandment, and there she found</a>
<a id='line_4832'>Arthur asleep in his bed, and Excalibur in his right hand naked. When</a>
<a id='line_4833'>she saw that she was passing heavy that she might not come by the sword</a>
<a id='line_4834'>without she had awaked him, and then she wist well she had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_4835'>Then she took the scabbard and went her way on horseback. When the king</a>
<a id='line_4836'>awoke and missed his scabbard, he was wroth, and he asked who had been</a>
<a id='line_4837'>there, and they said his sister, Queen Morgan had been there, and had</a>
<a id='line_4838'>put the scabbard under her mantle and was gone. Alas, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_4839'>falsely ye have watched me. Sir, said they all, we durst not disobey</a>
<a id='line_4840'>your sister’s commandment. Ah, said the king, let fetch the best horse</a>
<a id='line_4841'>may be found, and bid Sir Ontzlake arm him in all haste, and take</a>
<a id='line_4842'>another good horse and ride with me. So anon the king and Ontzlake were</a>
<a id='line_4843'>well armed, and rode after this lady, and so they came by a cross and</a>
<a id='line_4844'>found a cowherd, and they asked the poor man if there came any lady</a>
<a id='line_4845'>riding that way. Sir, said this poor man, right late came a lady riding</a>
<a id='line_4846'>with a forty horses, and to yonder forest she rode. Then they spurred</a>
<a id='line_4847'>their horses, and followed fast, and within a while Arthur had a sight</a>
<a id='line_4848'>of Morgan le Fay; then he chased as fast as he might. When she espied</a>
<a id='line_4849'>him following her, she rode a greater pace through the forest till she</a>
<a id='line_4850'>came to a plain, and when she saw she might not escape, she rode unto a</a>
<a id='line_4851'>lake thereby, and said, Whatsoever come of me, my brother shall not</a>
<a id='line_4852'>have this scabbard. And then she let throw the scabbard in the deepest</a>
<a id='line_4853'>of the water so it sank, for it was heavy of gold and precious stones.</a>
<a id='line_4854'></a>
<a id='line_4855'>Then she rode into a valley where many great stones were, and when she</a>
<a id='line_4856'>saw she must be overtaken, she shaped herself, horse and man, by</a>
<a id='line_4857'>enchantment unto a great marble stone. Anon withal came Sir Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_4858'>Sir Ontzlake whereas the king might know his sister and her men, and</a>
<a id='line_4859'>one knight from another. Ah, said the king, here may ye see the</a>
<a id='line_4860'>vengeance of God, and now am I sorry that this misadventure is</a>
<a id='line_4861'>befallen. And then he looked for the scabbard, but it would not be</a>
<a id='line_4862'>found, so he returned to the abbey where he came from. So when Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4863'>was gone she turned all into the likeliness as she and they were</a>
<a id='line_4864'>before, and said, Sirs, now may we go where we will.</a>

<a id='line_4867'></a>
<a id='line_4868'>CHAPTER XV. How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been</a>
<a id='line_4869'>drowned, and how King Arthur returned home again.</a>
<a id='line_4870'></a>
<a id='line_4871'>Then said Morgan, Saw ye Arthur, my brother? Yea, said her knights,</a>
<a id='line_4872'>right well, and that ye should have found an we might have stirred from</a>
<a id='line_4873'>one stead, for by his armyvestal countenance he would have caused us to</a>
<a id='line_4874'>have fled. I believe you, said Morgan. Anon after as she rode she met a</a>
<a id='line_4875'>knight leading another knight on his horse before him, bound hand and</a>
<a id='line_4876'>foot, blindfold, to have drowned him in a fountain. When she saw this</a>
<a id='line_4877'>knight so bound, she asked him, What will ye do with that knight? Lady,</a>
<a id='line_4878'>said he, I will drown him. For what cause? she asked. For I found him</a>
<a id='line_4879'>with my wife, and she shall have the same death anon. That were pity,</a>
<a id='line_4880'>said Morgan le Fay. Now, what say ye, knight, is it truth that he saith</a>
<a id='line_4881'>of you? she said to the knight that should be drowned. Nay truly,</a>
<a id='line_4882'>madam, he saith not right on me. Of whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay,</a>
<a id='line_4883'>and of what country? I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is</a>
<a id='line_4884'>Manassen, cousin unto Accolon of Gaul. Ye say well, said she, and for</a>
<a id='line_4885'>the love of him ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary</a>
<a id='line_4886'>in the same case ye be in. So Manassen was loosed and the other knight</a>
<a id='line_4887'>bound. And anon Manassen unarmed him, and armed himself in his harness,</a>
<a id='line_4888'>and so mounted on horseback, and the knight afore him, and so threw him</a>
<a id='line_4889'>into the fountain and drowned him. And then he rode unto Morgan again,</a>
<a id='line_4890'>and asked if she would anything unto King Arthur. Tell him that I</a>
<a id='line_4891'>rescued thee, not for the love of him but for the love of Accolon, and</a>
<a id='line_4892'>tell him I fear him not while I can make me and them that be with me in</a>
<a id='line_4893'>likeness of stones; and let him wit I can do much more when I see my</a>
<a id='line_4894'>time. And so she departed into the country of Gore, and there was she</a>
<a id='line_4895'>richly received, and made her castles and towns passing strong, for</a>
<a id='line_4896'>always she dreaded much King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_4897'></a>
<a id='line_4898'>When the king had well rested him at the abbey, he rode unto Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_4899'>and found his queen and his barons right glad of his coming. And when</a>
<a id='line_4900'>they heard of his strange adventures as is afore rehearsed, then all</a>
<a id='line_4901'>had marvel of the falsehood of Morgan le Fay; many knights wished her</a>
<a id='line_4902'>burnt. Then came Manassen to court and told the king of his adventure.</a>
<a id='line_4903'>Well, said the king, she is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged on her</a>
<a id='line_4904'>an I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it. So on the morn there</a>
<a id='line_4905'>came a damosel from Morgan to the king, and she brought with her the</a>
<a id='line_4906'>richest mantle that ever was seen in that court, for it was set as full</a>
<a id='line_4907'>of precious stones as one might stand by another, and there were the</a>
<a id='line_4908'>richest stones that ever the king saw. And the damosel said, Your</a>
<a id='line_4909'>sister sendeth you this mantle, and desireth that ye should take this</a>
<a id='line_4910'>gift of her; and in what thing she hath offended you, she will amend it</a>
<a id='line_4911'>at your own pleasure. When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him</a>
<a id='line_4912'>much, but he said but little.</a>

<a id='line_4916'>CHAPTER XVI. How the Damosel of the Lake saved King Arthur from mantle</a>
<a id='line_4917'>that should have burnt him.</a>
<a id='line_4918'></a>
<a id='line_4919'>With that came the Damosel of the Lake unto the king, and said, Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_4920'>must speak with you in privity. Say on, said the king, what ye will.</a>
<a id='line_4921'>Sir, said the damosel, put not on you this mantle till ye have seen</a>
<a id='line_4922'>more, and in no wise let it not come on you, nor on no knight of yours,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>till ye command the bringer thereof to put it upon her. Well, said King</a>
<a id='line_4924'>Arthur, it shall be done as ye counsel me. And then he said unto the</a>
<a id='line_4925'>damosel that came from his sister, Damosel, this mantle that ye have</a>
<a id='line_4926'>brought me, I will see it upon you. Sir, she said, It will not beseem</a>
<a id='line_4927'>me to wear a king’s garment. By my head, said Arthur, ye shall wear it</a>
<a id='line_4928'>or it come on my back, or any man’s that here is. And so the king made</a>
<a id='line_4929'>it to be put upon her, and forth withal she fell down dead, and never</a>
<a id='line_4930'>more spake word after and burnt to coals. Then was the king wonderly</a>
<a id='line_4931'>wroth, more than he was to-forehand, and said unto King Uriens, My</a>
<a id='line_4932'>sister, your wife, is alway about to betray me, and well I wot either</a>
<a id='line_4933'>ye, or my nephew, your son, is of counsel with her to have me</a>
<a id='line_4934'>destroyed; but as for you, said the king to King Uriens, I deem not</a>
<a id='line_4935'>greatly that ye be of her counsel, for Accolon confessed to me by his</a>
<a id='line_4936'>own mouth, that she would have destroyed you as well as me, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_4937'>hold you excused; but as for your son, Sir Uwaine, I hold him suspect,</a>
<a id='line_4938'>therefore I charge you put him out of my court. So Sir Uwaine was</a>
<a id='line_4939'>discharged. And when Sir Gawaine wist that, he made him ready to go</a>
<a id='line_4940'>with him; and said, Whoso banisheth my cousin-germain shall banish me.</a>
<a id='line_4941'>So they two departed, and rode into a great forest, and so they came to</a>
<a id='line_4942'>an abbey of monks, and there were well lodged. But when the king wist</a>
<a id='line_4943'>that Sir Gawaine was departed from the court, there was made great</a>
<a id='line_4944'>sorrow among all the estates. Now, said Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, we</a>
<a id='line_4945'>have lost two good knights for the love of one. So on the morn they</a>
<a id='line_4946'>heard their masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till that they</a>
<a id='line_4947'>came to a great forest. Then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a</a>
<a id='line_4948'>turret [of] twelve fair damosels, and two knights armed on great</a>
<a id='line_4949'>horses, and the damosels went to and fro by a tree. And then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_4950'>Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as</a>
<a id='line_4951'>the damosels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon the</a>
<a id='line_4952'>shield.</a>

<a id='line_4956'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine met with twelve fair</a>
<a id='line_4957'>damosels, and how they complained on Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_4958'></a>
<a id='line_4959'>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked why</a>
<a id='line_4960'>they did that despite to the shield. Sir, said the damosels, we shall</a>
<a id='line_4961'>tell you. There is a knight in this country that owneth this white</a>
<a id='line_4962'>shield, and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all</a>
<a id='line_4963'>ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the</a>
<a id='line_4964'>shield. I shall say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good</a>
<a id='line_4965'>knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though</a>
<a id='line_4966'>he hate you he hath some certain cause, and peradventure he loveth in</a>
<a id='line_4967'>some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, an he</a>
<a id='line_4968'>be such a man of prowess as ye speak of. Now, what is his name? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_4969'>said they, his name is Marhaus, the king’s son of Ireland. I know him</a>
<a id='line_4970'>well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is alive, for</a>
<a id='line_4971'>I saw him once proved at a jousts where many knights were gathered, and</a>
<a id='line_4972'>that time there might no man withstand him. Ah! said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_4973'>damosels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose, he that</a>
<a id='line_4974'>hung that shield there, he will not be long therefrom, and then may</a>
<a id='line_4975'>those knights match him on horseback, and that is more your worship</a>
<a id='line_4976'>than thus; for I will abide no longer to see a knight’s shield</a>
<a id='line_4977'>dishonoured. And therewith Sir Uwaine and Gawaine departed a little</a>
<a id='line_4978'>from them, and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a</a>
<a id='line_4979'>great horse straight toward them. And when the twelve damosels saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_4980'>Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild, so that some of</a>
<a id='line_4981'>them fell by the way. Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed</a>
<a id='line_4982'>his shield, and said on high, Sir Marhaus, defend thee. And so they ran</a>
<a id='line_4983'>together that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Marhaus smote</a>
<a id='line_4984'>him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse’s back. That saw the</a>
<a id='line_4985'>other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward Marhaus, and they</a>
<a id='line_4986'>met so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten</a>
<a id='line_4987'>down, horse and man, stark dead.</a>
<a id='line_4988'></a>
<a id='line_4989'></a>
<a id='line_4990'></a>
<a id='line_4991'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_4992'>and overthrew them both.</a>
<a id='line_4993'></a>
<a id='line_4994'>And then Sir Marhaus rode unto his shield, and saw how it was defouled,</a>
<a id='line_4995'>and said, Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her love that</a>
<a id='line_4996'>gave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine where thou</a>
<a id='line_4997'>wast; and so he hanged it about his neck. Then he rode straight unto</a>
<a id='line_4998'>Sir Gawaine and to Sir Uwaine, and asked them what they did there? They</a>
<a id='line_4999'>answered him that they came from King Arthur’s court to see adventures.</a>
<a id='line_5000'>Well, said Sir Marhaus, here am I ready, an adventurous knight that</a>
<a id='line_5001'>will fulfil any adventure that ye will desire; and so departed from</a>
<a id='line_5002'>them, to fetch his range. Let him go, said Sir Uwaine unto Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_5003'>for he is a passing good knight as any is living; I would not by my</a>
<a id='line_5004'>will that any of us were matched with him. Nay, said Sir Gawaine, not</a>
<a id='line_5005'>so, it were shame to us were he not assayed, were he never so good a</a>
<a id='line_5006'>knight. Well, said Sir Uwaine, I will assay him afore you, for I am</a>
<a id='line_5007'>more weaker than ye, and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me. So</a>
<a id='line_5008'>these two knights came together with great raundon, that Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_5009'>smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5010'>Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_5011'>hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side.</a>
<a id='line_5012'></a>
<a id='line_5013'>Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his</a>
<a id='line_5014'>spear, and when Sir Gawaine saw that he dressed his shield, and they</a>
<a id='line_5015'>aventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of</a>
<a id='line_5016'>their horses, that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their</a>
<a id='line_5017'>shields, but Sir Gawaine’s spear brake, but Sir Marhaus’ spear held;</a>
<a id='line_5018'>and therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth. And</a>
<a id='line_5019'>lightly Sir Gawaine rose on his feet, and pulled out his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_5020'>dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that, and</a>
<a id='line_5021'>pulled out his sword and began to come to Sir Gawaine on horseback. Sir</a>
<a id='line_5022'>knight, said Sir Gawaine, alight on foot, or else I will slay thy</a>
<a id='line_5023'>horse. Gramercy, said Sir Marhaus, of your gentleness ye teach me</a>
<a id='line_5024'>courtesy, for it is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on</a>
<a id='line_5025'>horseback. And therewith Sir Marhaus set his spear against a tree and</a>
<a id='line_5026'>alighted and tied his horse to a tree, and dressed his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_5027'>either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords</a>
<a id='line_5028'>that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and</a>
<a id='line_5029'>their hauberks, and wounded either other. But Sir Gawaine from it</a>
<a id='line_5030'>passed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger and stronger, for then it</a>
<a id='line_5031'>came to the hour of noon, and thrice his might was increased. All this</a>
<a id='line_5032'>espied Sir Marhaus and had great wonder how his might increased, and so</a>
<a id='line_5033'>they wounded other passing sore. And then when it was past noon, and</a>
<a id='line_5034'>when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine’s strength feebled, and waxed</a>
<a id='line_5035'>passing faint that unnethes he might dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5036'>was then bigger and bigger. Sir knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well</a>
<a id='line_5037'>felt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might as</a>
<a id='line_5038'>ever I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and</a>
<a id='line_5039'>therefore it were pity to do you hurt, for I feel ye are passing</a>
<a id='line_5040'>feeble. Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I</a>
<a id='line_5041'>should say. And therewith they took off their helms, and either kissed</a>
<a id='line_5042'>other, and there they swore together either to love other as brethren.</a>
<a id='line_5043'>And Sir Marhaus prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. And so</a>
<a id='line_5044'>they took their horses, and rode toward Sir Marhaus’ house. And as they</a>
<a id='line_5045'>rode by the way, Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, I have marvel that so</a>
<a id='line_5046'>valiant a man as ye be love no ladies nor damosels. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5047'>Marhaus, they name me wrongfully those that give me that name, but well</a>
<a id='line_5048'>I wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name me, and other such</a>
<a id='line_5049'>as they be. Now shall I tell you for what cause I hate them: for they</a>
<a id='line_5050'>be sorceresses and enchanters many of them, and be a knight never so</a>
<a id='line_5051'>good of his body and full of prowess as man may be, they will make him</a>
<a id='line_5052'>a stark coward to have the better of him, and this is the principal</a>
<a id='line_5053'>cause that I hate them; and to all good ladies and gentlewomen I owe my</a>
<a id='line_5054'>service as a knight ought to do.</a>
<a id='line_5055'></a>
<a id='line_5056'>As the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that</a>
<a id='line_5057'>overmatched Sir Gawaine, for all the thrice might that he had: Sir</a>
<a id='line_5058'>Launcelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percivale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5059'>Pelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir</a>
<a id='line_5060'>Gawaine. Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus’ place,</a>
<a id='line_5061'>which was in a little priory, and there they alighted, and ladies and</a>
<a id='line_5062'>damosels unarmed them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were</a>
<a id='line_5063'>all three hurt. And so they had all three good lodging with Sir</a>
<a id='line_5064'>Marhaus, and good cheer; for when he wist that they were King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_5065'>sister’s sons he made them all the cheer that lay in his power, and so</a>
<a id='line_5066'>they sojourned there a sennight, and were well eased of their wounds,</a>
<a id='line_5067'>and at the last departed. Now, said Sir Marhaus, we will not depart so</a>
<a id='line_5068'>lightly, for I will bring you through the forest; and rode day by day</a>
<a id='line_5069'>well a seven days or they found any adventure. At the last they came</a>
<a id='line_5070'>into a great forest, that was named the country and forest of Arroy,</a>
<a id='line_5071'>and the country of strange adventures. In this country, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5072'>Marhaus, came never knight since it was christened but he found strange</a>
<a id='line_5073'>adventures; and so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of</a>
<a id='line_5074'>stones, and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was</a>
<a id='line_5075'>the head of the stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting</a>
<a id='line_5076'>thereby. And then they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the</a>
<a id='line_5077'>eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and she was three score</a>
<a id='line_5078'>winter of age or more, and her hair was white under the garland. The</a>
<a id='line_5079'>second damosel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold</a>
<a id='line_5080'>about her head. The third damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a</a>
<a id='line_5081'>garland of flowers about her head. When these knights had so beheld</a>
<a id='line_5082'>them, they asked them the cause why they sat at that fountain? We be</a>
<a id='line_5083'>here, said the damosels, for this cause: if we may see any errant</a>
<a id='line_5084'>knights, to teach them unto strange adventures; and ye be three knights</a>
<a id='line_5085'>that seek adventures, and we be three damosels, and therefore each one</a>
<a id='line_5086'>of you must choose one of us; and when ye have done so we will lead you</a>
<a id='line_5087'>unto three highways, and there each of you shall choose a way and his</a>
<a id='line_5088'>damosel with him. And this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again, and</a>
<a id='line_5089'>God send you your lives, and thereto ye must plight your troth. This is</a>
<a id='line_5090'>well said, said Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_5091'></a>
<a id='line_5092'></a>
<a id='line_5093'></a>
<a id='line_5094'>CHAPTER XIX. How Sir Marhaus, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine met three</a>
<a id='line_5095'>damosels, and each of them took one.</a>
<a id='line_5096'></a>
<a id='line_5097'>Now shall everych of us choose a damosel. I shall tell you, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5098'>Uwaine, I am the youngest and most weakest of you both, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_5099'>will have the eldest damosel, for she hath seen much, and can best help</a>
<a id='line_5100'>me when I have need, for I have most need of help of you both. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5101'>said Sir Marhaus, I will have the damosel of thirty winter age, for she</a>
<a id='line_5102'>falleth best to me. Well, said Sir Gawaine, I thank you, for ye have</a>
<a id='line_5103'>left me the youngest and the fairest, and she is most liefest to me.</a>
<a id='line_5104'>Then every damosel took her knight by the reins of his bridle, and</a>
<a id='line_5105'>brought him to the three ways, and there was their oath made to meet at</a>
<a id='line_5106'>the fountain that day twelvemonth an they were living, and so they</a>
<a id='line_5107'>kissed and departed, and each knight set his lady behind him. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_5108'>Uwaine took the way that lay west, and Sir Marhaus took the way that</a>
<a id='line_5109'>lay south, and Sir Gawaine took the way that lay north. Now will we</a>
<a id='line_5110'>begin at Sir Gawaine, that held that way till that he came unto a fair</a>
<a id='line_5111'>manor, where dwelled an old knight and a good householder, and there</a>
<a id='line_5112'>Sir Gawaine asked the knight if he knew any adventures in that country.</a>
<a id='line_5113'>I shall show you some to-morn, said the old knight, and that</a>
<a id='line_5114'>marvellous. So, on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to</a>
<a id='line_5115'>a laund, and thereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved</a>
<a id='line_5116'>there came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever</a>
<a id='line_5117'>they saw, making the greatest dole that ever man made. And then he was</a>
<a id='line_5118'>ware of Sir Gawaine, and saluted him, and prayed God to send him much</a>
<a id='line_5119'>worship. As to that, said Sir Gawaine, gramercy; also I pray to God</a>
<a id='line_5120'>that he send you honour and worship. Ah, said the knight, I may lay</a>
<a id='line_5121'>that aside, for sorrow and shame cometh to me after worship.</a>
<a id='line_5122'></a>
<a id='line_5123'></a>
<a id='line_5124'></a>
<a id='line_5125'>CHAPTER XX. How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady.</a>
<a id='line_5126'></a>
<a id='line_5127'>And therewith he passed unto the one side of the laund; and on the</a>
<a id='line_5128'>other side saw Sir Gawaine ten knights that hoved still and made them</a>
<a id='line_5129'>ready with their shields and spears against that one knight that came</a>
<a id='line_5130'>by Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_5131'></a>
<a id='line_5132'>Then this one knight aventred a great spear, and one of the ten knights</a>
<a id='line_5133'>encountered with him, but this woful knight smote him so hard that he</a>
<a id='line_5134'>fell over his horse’s tail. So this same dolorous knight served them</a>
<a id='line_5135'>all, that at the leastway he smote down horse and man, and all he did</a>
<a id='line_5136'>with one spear; and so when they were all ten on foot, they went to</a>
<a id='line_5137'>that one knight, and he stood stone still, and suffered them to pull</a>
<a id='line_5138'>him down off his horse, and bound him hand and foot, and tied him under</a>
<a id='line_5139'>the horse’s belly, and so led him with them. O Jesu! said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_5140'>this is a doleful sight, to see the yonder knight so to be entreated,</a>
<a id='line_5141'>and it seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so, for</a>
<a id='line_5142'>he maketh no resistance. No, said his host, that is truth, for an he</a>
<a id='line_5143'>would they all were too weak so to do him. Sir, said the damosel unto</a>
<a id='line_5144'>Sir Gawaine, meseemeth it were your worship to help that dolorous</a>
<a id='line_5145'>knight, for methinketh he is one of the best knights that ever I saw. I</a>
<a id='line_5146'>would do for him, said Sir Gawaine, but it seemeth he will have no</a>
<a id='line_5147'>help. Then, said the damosel, methinketh ye have no lust to help him.</a>
<a id='line_5148'></a>
<a id='line_5149'>Thus as they talked they saw a knight on the other side of the laund</a>
<a id='line_5150'>all armed save the head. And on the other side there came a dwarf on</a>
<a id='line_5151'>horseback all armed save the head, with a great mouth and a short nose;</a>
<a id='line_5152'>and when the dwarf came nigh he said, Where is the lady should meet us</a>
<a id='line_5153'>here? and therewithal she came forth out of the wood. And then they</a>
<a id='line_5154'>began to strive for the lady; for the knight said he would have her,</a>
<a id='line_5155'>and the dwarf said he would have her. Will we do well? said the dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_5156'>yonder is a knight at the cross, let us put it both upon him, and as he</a>
<a id='line_5157'>deemeth so shall it be. I will well, said the knight, and so they went</a>
<a id='line_5158'>all three unto Sir Gawaine and told him wherefore they strove. Well,</a>
<a id='line_5159'>sirs, said he, will ye put the matter in my hand? Yea, they said both.</a>
<a id='line_5160'>Now damosel, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall stand betwixt them both, and</a>
<a id='line_5161'>whether ye list better to go to, he shall have you. And when she was</a>
<a id='line_5162'>set between them both, she left the knight and went to the dwarf, and</a>
<a id='line_5163'>the dwarf took her and went his way singing, and the knight went his</a>
<a id='line_5164'>way with great mourning.</a>
<a id='line_5165'></a>
<a id='line_5166'>Then came there two knights all armed, and cried on high, Sir Gawaine!</a>
<a id='line_5167'>knight of King Arthur’s, make thee ready in all haste and joust with</a>
<a id='line_5168'>me. So they ran together, that either fell down, and then on foot they</a>
<a id='line_5169'>drew their swords, and did full actually. The meanwhile the other</a>
<a id='line_5170'>knight went to the damosel, and asked her why she abode with that</a>
<a id='line_5171'>knight, and if ye would abide with me, I will be your faithful knight.</a>
<a id='line_5172'>And with you will I be, said the damosel, for with Sir Gawaine I may</a>
<a id='line_5173'>not find in mine heart to be with him; for now here was one knight</a>
<a id='line_5174'>discomfited ten knights, and at the last he was cowardly led away; and</a>
<a id='line_5175'>therefore let us two go whilst they fight. And Sir Gawaine fought with</a>
<a id='line_5176'>that other knight long, but at the last they accorded both. And then</a>
<a id='line_5177'>the knight prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. So as Sir</a>
<a id='line_5178'>Gawaine went with this knight he asked him, What knight is he in this</a>
<a id='line_5179'>country that smote down the ten knights? For when he had done so</a>
<a id='line_5180'>manfully he suffered them to bind him hand and foot, and so led him</a>
<a id='line_5181'>away. Ah, said the knight, that is the best knight I trow in the world,</a>
<a id='line_5182'>and the most man of prowess, and he hath been served so as he was even</a>
<a id='line_5183'>more than ten times, and his name hight Sir Pelleas, and he loveth a</a>
<a id='line_5184'>great lady in this country and her name is Ettard. And so when he loved</a>
<a id='line_5185'>her there was cried in this country a great jousts three days, and all</a>
<a id='line_5186'>the knights of this country were there and gentlewomen, and who that</a>
<a id='line_5187'>proved him the best knight should have a passing good sword and a</a>
<a id='line_5188'>circlet of gold, and the circlet the knight should give it to the</a>
<a id='line_5189'>fairest lady that was at the jousts. And this knight Sir Pelleas was</a>
<a id='line_5190'>the best knight that was there, and there were five hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_5191'>but there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas met withal but he struck</a>
<a id='line_5192'>him down, or else from his horse; and every day of three days he struck</a>
<a id='line_5193'>down twenty knights, therefore they gave him the prize, and forthwithal</a>
<a id='line_5194'>he went thereas the Lady Ettard was, and gave her the circlet, and said</a>
<a id='line_5195'>openly she was the fairest lady that there was, and that would he prove</a>
<a id='line_5196'>upon any knight that would say nay.</a>
<a id='line_5197'></a>
<a id='line_5198'></a>
<a id='line_5199'></a>
<a id='line_5200'>CHAPTER XXI. How King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner</a>
<a id='line_5201'>because he would have a sight of his lady, and how Sir Gawaine promised</a>
<a id='line_5202'>him to get to him the love of his lady.</a>
<a id='line_5203'></a>
<a id='line_5204'>And so he chose her for his sovereign lady, and never to love other but</a>
<a id='line_5205'>her, but she was so proud that she had scorn of him, and said that she</a>
<a id='line_5206'>would never love him though he would die for her. Wherefore all ladies</a>
<a id='line_5207'>and gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud, for there were</a>
<a id='line_5208'>fairer than she, and there was none that was there but an Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_5209'>would have proffered them love, they would have loved him for his noble</a>
<a id='line_5210'>prowess. And so this knight promised the Lady Ettard to follow her into</a>
<a id='line_5211'>this country, and never to leave her till she loved him. And thus he is</a>
<a id='line_5212'>here the most part nigh her, and lodged by a priory, and every week she</a>
<a id='line_5213'>sendeth knights to fight with him. And when he hath put them to the</a>
<a id='line_5214'>worse, then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner, because</a>
<a id='line_5215'>he would have a sight of this lady. And always she doth him great</a>
<a id='line_5216'>despite, for sometime she maketh her knights to tie him to his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_5217'>tail, and some to bind him under the horse’s belly; thus in the most</a>
<a id='line_5218'>shamefullest ways that she can think he is brought to her. And all she</a>
<a id='line_5219'>doth it for to cause him to leave this country, and to leave his</a>
<a id='line_5220'>loving; but all this cannot make him to leave, for an he would have</a>
<a id='line_5221'>fought on foot he might have had the better of the ten knights as well</a>
<a id='line_5222'>on foot as on horseback. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, it is great pity of</a>
<a id='line_5223'>him; and after this night I will seek him to-morrow, in this forest, to</a>
<a id='line_5224'>do him all the help I can. So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of</a>
<a id='line_5225'>his host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met</a>
<a id='line_5226'>with Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them</a>
<a id='line_5227'>saluted other, and asked him why he made such sorrow. And as it is</a>
<a id='line_5228'>above rehearsed, Sir Pelleas told Sir Gawaine: But always I suffer her</a>
<a id='line_5229'>knights to fare so with me as ye saw yesterday, in trust at the last to</a>
<a id='line_5230'>win her love, for she knoweth well all her knights should not lightly</a>
<a id='line_5231'>win me, an me list to fight with them to the uttermost. Wherefore an I</a>
<a id='line_5232'>loved her not so sore, I had liefer die an hundred times, an I might</a>
<a id='line_5233'>die so oft, rather than I would suffer that despite; but I trust she</a>
<a id='line_5234'>will have pity upon me at the last, for love causeth many a good knight</a>
<a id='line_5235'>to suffer to have his entent, but alas I am unfortunate. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_5236'>he made so great dole and sorrow that unnethe he might hold him on</a>
<a id='line_5237'>horseback.</a>
<a id='line_5238'></a>
<a id='line_5239'>Now, said Sir Gawaine, leave your mourning and I shall promise you by</a>
<a id='line_5240'>the faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the</a>
<a id='line_5241'>love of your lady, and thereto I will plight you my troth. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5242'>Pelleas, of what court are ye? tell me, I pray you, my good friend. And</a>
<a id='line_5243'>then Sir Gawaine said, I am of the court of King Arthur, and his</a>
<a id='line_5244'>sister’s son, and King Lot of Orkney was my father, and my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_5245'>Gawaine. And then he said, My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles,</a>
<a id='line_5246'>and of many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel</a>
<a id='line_5247'>till now in an unhappy time; and, sir knight, since ye are so nigh</a>
<a id='line_5248'>cousin unto King Arthur, and a king’s son, therefore betray me not but</a>
<a id='line_5249'>help me, for I may never come by her but by some good knight, for she</a>
<a id='line_5250'>is in a strong castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all</a>
<a id='line_5251'>this country she is lady of. And so I may never come to her presence,</a>
<a id='line_5252'>but as I suffer her knights to take me, and but if I did so that I</a>
<a id='line_5253'>might have a sight of her, I had been dead long or this time; and yet</a>
<a id='line_5254'>fair word had I never of her, but when I am brought to-fore her she</a>
<a id='line_5255'>rebuketh me in the foulest manner. And then they take my horse and</a>
<a id='line_5256'>harness and put me out of the gates, and she will not suffer me to eat</a>
<a id='line_5257'>nor drink; and always I offer me to be her prisoner, but that she will</a>
<a id='line_5258'>not suffer me, for I would desire no more, what pains so ever I had, so</a>
<a id='line_5259'>that I might have a sight of her daily. Well, said Sir Gawaine, all</a>
<a id='line_5260'>this shall I amend an ye will do as I shall devise: I will have your</a>
<a id='line_5261'>horse and your armour, and so will I ride unto her castle and tell her</a>
<a id='line_5262'>that I have slain you, and so shall I come within her to cause her to</a>
<a id='line_5263'>cherish me, and then shall I do my true part that ye shall not fail to</a>
<a id='line_5264'>have the love of her.</a>
<a id='line_5265'></a>
<a id='line_5266'></a>
<a id='line_5267'></a>
<a id='line_5268'>CHAPTER XXII. How Sir Gawaine came to the Lady Ettard, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_5269'>Pelleas found them sleeping.</a>
<a id='line_5270'></a>
<a id='line_5271'>And therewith Sir Gawaine plight his troth unto Sir Pelleas to be true</a>
<a id='line_5272'>and faithful unto him; so each one plight their troth to other, and so</a>
<a id='line_5273'>they changed horses and harness, and Sir Gawaine departed, and came to</a>
<a id='line_5274'>the castle whereas stood the pavilions of this lady without the gate.</a>
<a id='line_5275'>And as soon as Ettard had espied Sir Gawaine she fled in toward the</a>
<a id='line_5276'>castle. Sir Gawaine spake on high, and bade her abide, for he was not</a>
<a id='line_5277'>Sir Pelleas; I am another knight that have slain Sir Pelleas. Do off</a>
<a id='line_5278'>your helm, said the Lady Ettard, that I may see your visage. And so</a>
<a id='line_5279'>when she saw that it was not Sir Pelleas, she bade him alight and led</a>
<a id='line_5280'>him unto her castle, and asked him faithfully whether he had slain Sir</a>
<a id='line_5281'>Pelleas. And he said her yea, and told her his name was Sir Gawaine of</a>
<a id='line_5282'>the court of King Arthur, and his sister’s son. Truly, said she, that</a>
<a id='line_5283'>is great pity, for he was a passing good knight of his body, but of all</a>
<a id='line_5284'>men alive I hated him most, for I could never be quit of him; and for</a>
<a id='line_5285'>ye have slain him I shall be your woman, and to do anything that might</a>
<a id='line_5286'>please you. So she made Sir Gawaine good cheer. Then Sir Gawaine said</a>
<a id='line_5287'>that he loved a lady and by no means she would love him. She is to</a>
<a id='line_5288'>blame, said Ettard, an she will not love you, for ye that be so well</a>
<a id='line_5289'>born a man, and such a man of prowess, there is no lady in the world</a>
<a id='line_5290'>too good for you. Will ye, said Sir Gawaine, promise me to do all that</a>
<a id='line_5291'>ye may, by the faith of your body, to get me the love of my lady? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_5292'>sir, said she, and that I promise you by the faith of my body. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5293'>said Sir Gawaine, it is yourself that I love so well, therefore I pray</a>
<a id='line_5294'>you hold your promise. I may not choose, said the Lady Ettard, but if I</a>
<a id='line_5295'>should be forsworn; and so she granted him to fulfil all his desire.</a>
<a id='line_5296'></a>
<a id='line_5297'>So it was then in the month of May that she and Sir Gawaine went out of</a>
<a id='line_5298'>the castle and supped in a pavilion, and there was made a bed, and</a>
<a id='line_5299'>there Sir Gawaine and the Lady Ettard went to bed together, and in</a>
<a id='line_5300'>another pavilion she laid her damosels, and in the third pavilion she</a>
<a id='line_5301'>laid part of her knights, for then she had no dread of Sir Pelleas. And</a>
<a id='line_5302'>there Sir Gawaine lay with her in that pavilion two days and two</a>
<a id='line_5303'>nights. And on the third day, in the morning early, Sir Pelleas armed</a>
<a id='line_5304'>him, for he had never slept since Sir Gawaine departed from him; for</a>
<a id='line_5305'>Sir Gawaine had promised him by the faith of his body, to come to him</a>
<a id='line_5306'>unto his pavilion by that priory within the space of a day and a night.</a>
<a id='line_5307'></a>
<a id='line_5308'>Then Sir Pelleas mounted upon horseback, and came to the pavilions that</a>
<a id='line_5309'>stood without the castle, and found in the first pavilion three knights</a>
<a id='line_5310'>in three beds, and three squires lying at their feet. Then went he to</a>
<a id='line_5311'>the second pavilion and found four gentlewomen lying in four beds. And</a>
<a id='line_5312'>then he yede to the third pavilion and found Sir Gawaine lying in bed</a>
<a id='line_5313'>with his Lady Ettard, and either clipping other in arms, and when he</a>
<a id='line_5314'>saw that his heart well-nigh brast for sorrow, and said: Alas! that</a>
<a id='line_5315'>ever a knight should be found so false; and then he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_5316'>might not abide no longer for pure sorrow. And when he had ridden nigh</a>
<a id='line_5317'>half a mile he turned again and thought to slay them both; and when he</a>
<a id='line_5318'>saw them both so lie sleeping fast, unnethe he might hold him on</a>
<a id='line_5319'>horseback for sorrow, and said thus to himself, Though this knight be</a>
<a id='line_5320'>never so false, I will never slay him sleeping, for I will never</a>
<a id='line_5321'>destroy the high order of knighthood; and therewith he departed again.</a>
<a id='line_5322'>And or he had ridden half a mile he returned again, and thought then to</a>
<a id='line_5323'>slay them both, making the greatest sorrow that ever man made. And when</a>
<a id='line_5324'>he came to the pavilions, he tied his horse unto a tree, and pulled out</a>
<a id='line_5325'>his sword naked in his hand, and went to them thereas they lay, and yet</a>
<a id='line_5326'>he thought it were shame to slay them sleeping, and laid the naked</a>
<a id='line_5327'>sword overthwart both their throats, and so took his horse and rode his</a>
<a id='line_5328'>way.</a>
<a id='line_5329'></a>
<a id='line_5330'>And when Sir Pelleas came to his pavilions he told his knights and his</a>
<a id='line_5331'>squires how he had sped, and said thus to them, For your true and good</a>
<a id='line_5332'>service ye have done me I shall give you all my goods, for I will go</a>
<a id='line_5333'>unto my bed and never arise until I am dead. And when that I am dead I</a>
<a id='line_5334'>charge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her</a>
<a id='line_5335'>betwixt two silver dishes, and tell her how I saw her lie with the</a>
<a id='line_5336'>false knight Sir Gawaine. Right so Sir Pelleas unarmed himself, and</a>
<a id='line_5337'>went unto his bed making marvellous dole and sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_5338'></a>
<a id='line_5339'>When Sir Gawaine and Ettard awoke of their sleep, and found the naked</a>
<a id='line_5340'>sword overthwart their throats, then she knew well it was Sir Pelleas’</a>
<a id='line_5341'>sword. Alas! said she to Sir Gawaine, ye have betrayed me and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5342'>Pelleas both, for ye told me ye had slain him, and now I know well it</a>
<a id='line_5343'>is not so, he is alive. And if Sir Pelleas had been as uncourteous to</a>
<a id='line_5344'>you as ye have been to him ye had been a dead knight; but ye have</a>
<a id='line_5345'>deceived me and betrayed me falsely, that all ladies and damosels may</a>
<a id='line_5346'>beware by you and me. And therewith Sir Gawaine made him ready, and</a>
<a id='line_5347'>went into the forest. So it happed then that the Damosel of the Lake,</a>
<a id='line_5348'>Nimue, met with a knight of Sir Pelleas, that went on his foot in the</a>
<a id='line_5349'>forest making great dole, and she asked him the cause. And so the woful</a>
<a id='line_5350'>knight told her how his master and lord was betrayed through a knight</a>
<a id='line_5351'>and lady, and how he will never arise out of his bed till he be dead.</a>
<a id='line_5352'>Bring me to him, said she anon, and I will warrant his life he shall</a>
<a id='line_5353'>not die for love, and she that hath caused him so to love, she shall be</a>
<a id='line_5354'>in as evil plight as he is or it be long to, for it is no joy of such a</a>
<a id='line_5355'>proud lady that will have no mercy of such a valiant knight. Anon that</a>
<a id='line_5356'>knight brought her unto him, and when she saw him lie in his bed, she</a>
<a id='line_5357'>thought she saw never so likely a knight; and therewith she threw an</a>
<a id='line_5358'>enchantment upon him, and he fell asleep. And therewhile she rode unto</a>
<a id='line_5359'>the Lady Ettard, and charged no man to awake him till she came again.</a>
<a id='line_5360'>So within two hours she brought the Lady Ettard thither, and both</a>
<a id='line_5361'>ladies found him asleep: Lo, said the Damosel of the Lake, ye ought to</a>
<a id='line_5362'>be ashamed for to murder such a knight. And therewith she threw such an</a>
<a id='line_5363'>enchantment upon her that she loved him sore, that well-nigh she was</a>
<a id='line_5364'>out of her mind. O Lord Jesu, said the Lady Ettard, how is it befallen</a>
<a id='line_5365'>unto me that I love now him that I have most hated of any man alive?</a>
<a id='line_5366'>That is the righteous judgment of God, said the damosel. And then anon</a>
<a id='line_5367'>Sir Pelleas awaked and looked upon Ettard; and when he saw her he knew</a>
<a id='line_5368'>her, and then he hated her more than any woman alive, and said: Away,</a>
<a id='line_5369'>traitress, come never in my sight. And when she heard him say so, she</a>
<a id='line_5370'>wept and made great sorrow out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_5371'></a>
<a id='line_5372'></a>
<a id='line_5373'></a>
<a id='line_5374'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the</a>
<a id='line_5375'>Damosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.</a>
<a id='line_5376'></a>
<a id='line_5377'>Sir knight Pelleas, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse and</a>
<a id='line_5378'>come forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a lady that</a>
<a id='line_5379'>shall love you. I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for this Lady Ettard</a>
<a id='line_5380'>hath done me great despite and shame, and there he told her the</a>
<a id='line_5381'>beginning and ending, and how he had purposed never to have arisen till</a>
<a id='line_5382'>that he had been dead. And now such grace God hath sent me, that I hate</a>
<a id='line_5383'>her as much as ever I loved her, thanked be our Lord Jesus! Thank me,</a>
<a id='line_5384'>said the Damosel of the Lake. Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his</a>
<a id='line_5385'>horse, and commanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff</a>
<a id='line_5386'>where the Damosel of the Lake would assign. So the Lady Ettard died for</a>
<a id='line_5387'>sorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved</a>
<a id='line_5388'>together during their life days.</a>
<a id='line_5389'></a>
<a id='line_5390'></a>
<a id='line_5391'></a>
<a id='line_5392'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he came to</a>
<a id='line_5393'>the Duke of the South Marches.</a>
<a id='line_5394'></a>
<a id='line_5395'>Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of thirty</a>
<a id='line_5396'>winter of age, southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by</a>
<a id='line_5397'>fortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep way, and at the last</a>
<a id='line_5398'>they came unto a courtelage, and there they asked harbour. But the man</a>
<a id='line_5399'>of the courtelage would not lodge them for no treatise that they could</a>
<a id='line_5400'>treat, but thus much the good man said, An ye will take the adventure</a>
<a id='line_5401'>of your lodging, I shall bring you where ye shall be lodged. What</a>
<a id='line_5402'>adventure is that that I shall have for my lodging? said Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_5403'>Ye shall wit when ye come there, said the good man. Sir, what adventure</a>
<a id='line_5404'>so it be, bring me thither I pray thee, said Sir Marhaus; for I am</a>
<a id='line_5405'>weary, my damosel, and my horse. So the good man went and opened the</a>
<a id='line_5406'>gate, and within an hour he brought him unto a fair castle, and then</a>
<a id='line_5407'>the poor man called the porter, and anon he was let into the castle,</a>
<a id='line_5408'>and so he told the lord how he brought him a knight errant and a</a>
<a id='line_5409'>damosel that would be lodged with him. Let him in, said the lord, it</a>
<a id='line_5410'>may happen he shall repent that they took their lodging here.</a>
<a id='line_5411'></a>
<a id='line_5412'>So Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly sight</a>
<a id='line_5413'>of young men that welcomed him. And then his horse was led into the</a>
<a id='line_5414'>stable, and he and the damosel were brought into the hall, and there</a>
<a id='line_5415'>stood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him. Then this lord asked</a>
<a id='line_5416'>him what he hight, and from whence he came, and with whom he dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_5417'>Sir, he said, I am a knight of King Arthur’s and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_5418'>Round, and my name is Sir Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland. And then</a>
<a id='line_5419'>said the duke to him, That me sore repenteth: the cause is this, for I</a>
<a id='line_5420'>love not thy lord nor none of thy fellows of the Table Round; and</a>
<a id='line_5421'>therefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest, for as</a>
<a id='line_5422'>to-morn I and my six sons shall match with you. Is there no remedy but</a>
<a id='line_5423'>that I must have ado with you and your six sons at once? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5424'>Marhaus. No, said the duke, for this cause I made mine avow, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_5425'>Gawaine slew my seven sons in a recounter, therefore I made mine avow,</a>
<a id='line_5426'>there should never knight of King Arthur’s court lodge with me, or come</a>
<a id='line_5427'>thereas I might have ado with him, but that I would have a revenging of</a>
<a id='line_5428'>my sons’ death. What is your name? said Sir Marhaus; I require you tell</a>
<a id='line_5429'>me, an it please you. Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_5430'>said Sir Marhaus, I have heard say that ye have been long time a great</a>
<a id='line_5431'>foe unto my lord Arthur and to his knights. That shall ye feel to-morn,</a>
<a id='line_5432'>said the duke. Shall I have ado with you? said Sir Marhaus. Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_5433'>the duke, thereof shalt thou not choose, and therefore take you to your</a>
<a id='line_5434'>chamber, and ye shall have all that to you longeth. So Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5435'>departed and was led to a chamber, and his damosel was led unto her</a>
<a id='line_5436'>chamber. And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus and bade make</a>
<a id='line_5437'>him ready. And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and then there was a</a>
<a id='line_5438'>mass sung afore him, and brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in</a>
<a id='line_5439'>the court of the castle where they should do the battle. So there was</a>
<a id='line_5440'>the duke all ready on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons by him,</a>
<a id='line_5441'>and everych had a spear in his hand, and so they encountered, whereas</a>
<a id='line_5442'>the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him, but Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5443'>held up his spear and touched none of them.</a>
<a id='line_5444'></a>

<a id='line_5446'></a>
<a id='line_5447'>CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Marhaus fought with the duke and his four sons and</a>
<a id='line_5448'>made them to yield them.</a>
<a id='line_5449'></a>
<a id='line_5450'>Then came the four sons by couple, and two of them brake their spears,</a>
<a id='line_5451'>and so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them</a>
<a id='line_5452'>not. Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear</a>
<a id='line_5453'>that horse and man fell to the earth, and so he served his sons; and</a>
<a id='line_5454'>then Sir Marhaus alighted down and bade the duke yield him or else he</a>
<a id='line_5455'>would slay him. And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set</a>
<a id='line_5456'>upon Sir Marhaus; then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or</a>
<a id='line_5457'>else I will do the uttermost to you all. Then the duke saw he might not</a>
<a id='line_5458'>escape the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them</a>
<a id='line_5459'>to Sir Marhaus; and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their</a>
<a id='line_5460'>swords to the knight, and so he received them. And then they helped up</a>
<a id='line_5461'>their father, and so by their cominal assent promised to Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5462'>never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after</a>
<a id='line_5463'>to come, he and his sons, and put them in the king’s grace.</a>
<a id='line_5464'></a>
<a id='line_5465'>Then Sir Marhaus departed, and within two days his damosel brought him</a>
<a id='line_5466'>whereas was a great tournament that the Lady de Vawse had cried. And</a>
<a id='line_5467'>who that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand</a>
<a id='line_5468'>besants. And there Sir Marhaus did so nobly that he was renowned, and</a>
<a id='line_5469'>had sometime down forty knights, and so the circlet of gold was</a>
<a id='line_5470'>rewarded him. Then he departed from them with great worship; and so</a>
<a id='line_5471'>within seven nights his damosel brought him to an earl’s place, his</a>
<a id='line_5472'>name was the Earl Fergus, that after was Sir Tristram’s knight; and</a>
<a id='line_5473'>this earl was but a young man, and late come into his lands, and there</a>
<a id='line_5474'>was a giant fast by him that hight Taulurd, and he had another brother</a>
<a id='line_5475'>in Cornwall that hight Taulas, that Sir Tristram slew when he was out</a>
<a id='line_5476'>of his mind. So this earl made his complaint unto Sir Marhaus, that</a>
<a id='line_5477'>there was a giant by him that destroyed all his lands, and how he durst</a>
<a id='line_5478'>nowhere ride nor go for him. Sir, said the knight, whether useth he to</a>
<a id='line_5479'>fight on horseback or on foot? Nay, said the earl, there may no horse</a>
<a id='line_5480'>bear him. Well, said Sir Marhaus, then will I fight with him on foot;</a>
<a id='line_5481'>so on the morn Sir Marhaus prayed the earl that one of his men might</a>
<a id='line_5482'>bring him whereas the giant was; and so he was, for he saw him sit</a>
<a id='line_5483'>under a tree of holly, and many clubs of iron and gisarms about him. So</a>
<a id='line_5484'>this knight dressed him to the giant, putting his shield afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_5485'>the giant took an iron club in his hand, and at the first stroke he</a>
<a id='line_5486'>clave Sir Marhaus’ shield in two pieces. And there he was in great</a>
<a id='line_5487'>peril, for the giant was a wily fighter, but at last Sir Marhaus smote</a>
<a id='line_5488'>off his right arm above the elbow.</a>
<a id='line_5489'></a>
<a id='line_5490'>Then the giant fled and the knight after him, and so he drove him into</a>
<a id='line_5491'>a water, but the giant was so high that he might not wade after him.</a>
<a id='line_5492'>And then Sir Marhaus made the Earl Fergus’ man to fetch him stones, and</a>
<a id='line_5493'>with those stones the knight gave the giant many sore knocks, till at</a>
<a id='line_5494'>the last he made him fall down into the water, and so was he there</a>
<a id='line_5495'>dead. Then Sir Marhaus went unto the giant’s castle, and there he</a>
<a id='line_5496'>delivered twenty-four ladies and twelve knights out of the giant’s</a>
<a id='line_5497'>prison, and there he had great riches without number, so that the days</a>
<a id='line_5498'>of his life he was never poor man. Then he returned to the Earl Fergus,</a>
<a id='line_5499'>the which thanked him greatly, and would have given him half his lands,</a>
<a id='line_5500'>but he would none take. So Sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nigh half</a>
<a id='line_5501'>a year, for he was sore bruised with the giant, and at the last he took</a>
<a id='line_5502'>his leave. And as he rode by the way, he met with Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5503'>Uwaine, and so by adventure he met with four knights of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_5504'>the first was Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Osanna, Sir Dodinas le</a>
<a id='line_5505'>Savage, and Sir Felot of Listinoise; and there Sir Marhaus with one</a>
<a id='line_5506'>spear smote down these four knights, and hurt them sore. So he departed</a>
<a id='line_5507'>to meet at his day aforeset.</a>

<a id='line_5511'>CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Uwaine rode with the damosel of sixty year of</a>
<a id='line_5512'>age, and how he gat the prize at tourneying.</a>
<a id='line_5513'></a>
<a id='line_5514'>Now turn we unto Sir Uwaine, that rode westward with his damosel of</a>
<a id='line_5515'>three score winter of age, and she brought him thereas was a tournament</a>
<a id='line_5516'>nigh the march of Wales. And at that tournament Sir Uwaine smote down</a>
<a id='line_5517'>thirty knights, therefore was given him the prize, and that was a</a>
<a id='line_5518'>gerfalcon, and a white steed trapped with cloth of gold. So then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5519'>Uwaine did many strange adventures by the means of the old damosel, and</a>
<a id='line_5520'>so she brought him to a lady that was called the Lady of the Rock, the</a>
<a id='line_5521'>which was much courteous. So there were in the country two knights that</a>
<a id='line_5522'>were brethren, and they were called two perilous knights, the one</a>
<a id='line_5523'>knight hight Sir Edward of the Red Castle, and the other Sir Hue of the</a>
<a id='line_5524'>Red Castle; and these two brethren had disherited the Lady of the Rock</a>
<a id='line_5525'>of a barony of lands by their extortion. And as this knight was lodged</a>
<a id='line_5526'>with this lady she made her complaint to him of these two knights.</a>
<a id='line_5527'></a>
<a id='line_5528'>Madam, said Sir Uwaine, they are to blame, for they do against the high</a>
<a id='line_5529'>order of knighthood, and the oath that they made; and if it like you I</a>
<a id='line_5530'>will speak with them, because I am a knight of King Arthur’s, and I</a>
<a id='line_5531'>will entreat them with fairness; and if they will not, I shall do</a>
<a id='line_5532'>battle with them, and in the defence of your right. Gramercy said the</a>
<a id='line_5533'>lady, and thereas I may not acquit you, God shall. So on the morn the</a>
<a id='line_5534'>two knights were sent for, that they should come thither to speak with</a>
<a id='line_5535'>the Lady of the Rock, and wit ye well they failed not, for they came</a>
<a id='line_5536'>with an hundred horse. But when this lady saw them in this manner so</a>
<a id='line_5537'>big, she would not suffer Sir Uwaine to go out to them upon no surety</a>
<a id='line_5538'>nor for no fair language, but she made him speak with them over a</a>
<a id='line_5539'>tower, but finally these two brethren would not be entreated, and</a>
<a id='line_5540'>answered that they would keep that they had. Well, said Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_5541'>then will I fight with one of you, and prove that ye do this lady</a>
<a id='line_5542'>wrong. That will we not, said they, for an we do battle, we two will</a>
<a id='line_5543'>fight with one knight at once, and therefore if ye will fight so, we</a>
<a id='line_5544'>will be ready at what hour ye will assign. And if ye win us in battle</a>
<a id='line_5545'>the lady shall have her lands again. Ye say well, said Sir Uwaine,</a>
<a id='line_5546'>therefore make you ready so that ye be here to-morn in the defence of</a>
<a id='line_5547'>the lady’s right.</a>

<a id='line_5552'>them.</a>
<a id='line_5553'></a>
<a id='line_5554'>So was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason should be</a>
<a id='line_5555'>wrought on neither party; so then the knights departed and made them</a>
<a id='line_5556'>ready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer. And on the morn he</a>
<a id='line_5557'>arose early and heard mass, and brake his fast, and so he rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_5558'>plain without the gates, where hoved the two brethren abiding him. So</a>
<a id='line_5559'>they rode together passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake</a>
<a id='line_5560'>their spears upon Sir Uwaine. And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he</a>
<a id='line_5561'>fell over his horse and yet his spear brast not. And then he spurred</a>
<a id='line_5562'>his horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon</a>
<a id='line_5563'>recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade Sir</a>
<a id='line_5564'>Uwaine alight and do his battle to the uttermost. Then Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_5565'>devoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore him and drew his</a>
<a id='line_5566'>sword, and so they dressed together, and either gave other such</a>
<a id='line_5567'>strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir Uwaine passing</a>
<a id='line_5568'>grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he should have died. And</a>
<a id='line_5569'>thus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason. And at</a>
<a id='line_5570'>the last Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that</a>
<a id='line_5571'>his sword carved unto his canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his</a>
<a id='line_5572'>courage, but Sir Uwaine pressed fast to have slain him. That saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_5573'>Hue: he kneeled down and yielded him to Sir Uwaine. And he of his</a>
<a id='line_5574'>gentleness received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into</a>
<a id='line_5575'>the castle together. Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and</a>
<a id='line_5576'>the other brother made great sorrow for his brother’s death. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5577'>lady was restored of all her lands, and Sir Hue was commanded to be at</a>
<a id='line_5578'>the court of King Arthur at the next feast of Pentecost. So Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_5579'>dwelt with the lady nigh half a year, for it was long or he might be</a>
<a id='line_5580'>whole of his great hurts. And so when it drew nigh the term-day that</a>
<a id='line_5581'>Sir Gawaine, Sir Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way,</a>
<a id='line_5582'>then every knight drew him thither to hold his promise that they had</a>
<a id='line_5583'>made; and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them,</a>
<a id='line_5584'>but Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.</a>
<a id='line_5585'></a>
<a id='line_5586'></a>
<a id='line_5587'></a>
<a id='line_5588'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How at the year’s end all three knights with their</a>
<a id='line_5589'>three damosels met at the fountain.</a>
<a id='line_5590'></a>
<a id='line_5591'>Right so at the twelvemonths’ end they met all three knights at the</a>
<a id='line_5592'>fountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine had could</a>
<a id='line_5593'>say but little worship of him so they departed from the damosels and</a>
<a id='line_5594'>rode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that</a>
<a id='line_5595'>came from King Arthur, that had sought them well-nigh a twelvemonth</a>
<a id='line_5596'>throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he</a>
<a id='line_5597'>might find Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine to bring them to the court again.</a>
<a id='line_5598'>And then were they all glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride</a>
<a id='line_5599'>with them to the king’s court. And so within twelve days they came to</a>
<a id='line_5600'>Camelot, and the king was passing glad of their coming, and so was all</a>
<a id='line_5601'>the court. Then the king made them to swear upon a book to tell him all</a>
<a id='line_5602'>their adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth, and so they</a>
<a id='line_5603'>did. And there was Sir Marhaus well known, for there were knights that</a>
<a id='line_5604'>he had matched aforetime, and he was named one of the best knights</a>
<a id='line_5605'>living.</a>
<a id='line_5606'></a>
<a id='line_5607'>Against the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and brought</a>
<a id='line_5608'>with her Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was great jousting</a>
<a id='line_5609'>of knights, and of all knights that were at that jousts, Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_5610'>had the prize, and Sir Marhaus was named the next; but Sir Pelleas was</a>
<a id='line_5611'>so strong there might but few knights sit him a buffet with a spear.</a>
<a id='line_5612'>And at that next feast Sir Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made knights of</a>
<a id='line_5613'>the Table Round, for there were two sieges void, for two knights were</a>
<a id='line_5614'>slain that twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_5615'>and of Sir Marhaus. But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawaine, but as</a>
<a id='line_5616'>he spared him for the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts and</a>
<a id='line_5617'>tournaments Sir Pelleas quit Sir Gawaine, for so it rehearseth in the</a>
<a id='line_5618'>book of French. So Sir Tristram many days after fought with Sir Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_5619'>in an island, and there they did a great battle, but at the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_5620'>Tristram slew him, so Sir Tristram was wounded that unnethe he might</a>
<a id='line_5621'>recover, and lay at a nunnery half a year. And Sir Pelleas was a</a>
<a id='line_5622'>worshipful knight, and was one of the four that achieved the Sangreal,</a>
<a id='line_5623'>and the Damosel of the Lake made by her means that never he had ado</a>
<a id='line_5624'>with Sir Launcelot de Lake, for where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts</a>
<a id='line_5625'>or any tournament, she would not suffer him be there that day, but if</a>
<a id='line_5626'>it were on the side of Sir Launcelot.</a>

<a id='line_5637'>CHAPTER I. How twelve aged ambassadors of Rome came to King Arthur to</a>
<a id='line_5638'>demand truage for Britain.</a>
<a id='line_5639'></a>
<a id='line_5640'>When King Arthur had after long war rested, and held a royal feast and</a>
<a id='line_5641'>Table Round with his allies of kings, princes, and noble knights all of</a>
<a id='line_5642'>the Round Table, there came into his hall, he sitting in his throne</a>
<a id='line_5643'>royal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in</a>
<a id='line_5644'>token that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor</a>
<a id='line_5645'>Lucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the</a>
<a id='line_5646'>Public Weal of Rome. Which said messengers, after their entering and</a>
<a id='line_5647'>coming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him their obeisance in</a>
<a id='line_5648'>making to him reverence, and said to him in this wise: The high and</a>
<a id='line_5649'>mighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain greeting,</a>
<a id='line_5650'>commanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord, and to send him the</a>
<a id='line_5651'>truage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and other</a>
<a id='line_5652'>to-fore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel not</a>
<a id='line_5653'>knowing him as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to the</a>
<a id='line_5654'>statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar,</a>
<a id='line_5655'>conqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome. And if thou refuse</a>
<a id='line_5656'>his demand and commandment know thou for certain that he shall make</a>
<a id='line_5657'>strong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee</a>
<a id='line_5658'>and thy subjects, that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all kings</a>
<a id='line_5659'>and princes, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which</a>
<a id='line_5660'>domineth upon the universal world. Then when they had showed the effect</a>
<a id='line_5661'>of their message, the king commanded them to withdraw them, and said he</a>
<a id='line_5662'>should take advice of council and give to them an answer. Then some of</a>
<a id='line_5663'>the young knights, hearing this their message, would have run on them</a>
<a id='line_5664'>to have slain them, saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights</a>
<a id='line_5665'>there being present to suffer them to say so to the king. And anon the</a>
<a id='line_5666'>king commanded that none of them, upon pain of death, to missay them</a>
<a id='line_5667'>nor do them any harm, and commanded a knight to bring them to their</a>
<a id='line_5668'>lodging, and see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for</a>
<a id='line_5669'>them, with the best cheer, and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans</a>
<a id='line_5670'>be great lords, and though their message please me not nor my court,</a>
<a id='line_5671'>yet I must remember mine honour.</a>
<a id='line_5672'></a>
<a id='line_5673'>After this the king let call all his lords and knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_5674'>Table to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their</a>
<a id='line_5675'>advice. Then Sir Cador of Cornwall spake first and said, Sir, this</a>
<a id='line_5676'>message liketh me well, for we have many days rested us and have been</a>
<a id='line_5677'>idle, and now I hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans, where I</a>
<a id='line_5678'>doubt not we shall get honour. I believe well, said Arthur, that this</a>
<a id='line_5679'>matter pleaseth thee well, but these answers may not be answered, for</a>
<a id='line_5680'>the demand grieveth me sore, for truly I will never pay truage to Rome,</a>
<a id='line_5681'>wherefore I pray you to counsel me. I have understood that Belinus and</a>
<a id='line_5682'>Brenius, kings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many</a>
<a id='line_5683'>days, and also Constantine the son of Heleine, which is an open</a>
<a id='line_5684'>evidence that we owe no tribute to Rome but of right we that be</a>
<a id='line_5685'>descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire.</a>

<a id='line_5689'>CHAPTER II. How the kings and lords promised to King Arthur aid and</a>
<a id='line_5690'>help against the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_5691'></a>
<a id='line_5692'>Then answered King Anguish of Scotland, Sir, ye ought of right to be</a>
<a id='line_5693'>above all other kings, for unto you is none like nor pareil in</a>
<a id='line_5694'>Christendom, of knighthood nor of dignity, and I counsel you never to</a>
<a id='line_5695'>obey the Romans, for when they reigned on us they distressed our</a>
<a id='line_5696'>elders, and put this land to great extortions and tallies, wherefore I</a>
<a id='line_5697'>make here mine avow to avenge me on them; and for to strengthen your</a>
<a id='line_5698'>quarrel I shall furnish twenty thousand good men of war, and wage them</a>
<a id='line_5699'>on my costs, which shall await on you with myself when it shall please</a>
<a id='line_5700'>you. And the king of Little Britain granted him to the same thirty</a>
<a id='line_5701'>thousand; wherefore King Arthur thanked them. And then every man agreed</a>
<a id='line_5702'>to make war, and to aid after their power; that is to wit, the lord of</a>
<a id='line_5703'>West Wales promised to bring thirty thousand men, and Sir Uwaine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5704'>Ider his son, with their cousins, promised to bring thirty thousand.</a>
<a id='line_5705'>Then Sir Launcelot with all other promised in likewise every man a</a>
<a id='line_5706'>great multitude.</a>
<a id='line_5707'></a>
<a id='line_5708'>And when King Arthur understood their courages and good wills he</a>
<a id='line_5709'>thanked them heartily, and after let call the ambassadors to hear their</a>
<a id='line_5710'>answer. And in presence of all his lords and knights he said to them in</a>
<a id='line_5711'>this wise: I will that ye return unto your lord and Procuror of the</a>
<a id='line_5712'>Common Weal for the Romans, and say ye to him, Of his demand and</a>
<a id='line_5713'>commandment I set nothing, and that I know of no truage nor tribute</a>
<a id='line_5714'>that I owe to him, nor to none earthly prince, Christian nor heathen;</a>
<a id='line_5715'>but I pretend to have and occupy the sovereignty of the empire, wherein</a>
<a id='line_5716'>I am entitled by the right of my predecessors, sometime kings of this</a>
<a id='line_5717'>land; and say to him that I am delibered and fully concluded, to go</a>
<a id='line_5718'>with mine army with strength and power unto Rome, by the grace of God,</a>
<a id='line_5719'>to take possession in the empire and subdue them that be rebel.</a>
<a id='line_5720'>Wherefore I command him and all them of Rome, that incontinent they</a>
<a id='line_5721'>make to me their homage, and to acknowledge me for their Emperor and</a>
<a id='line_5722'>Governor, upon pain that shall ensue. And then he commanded his</a>
<a id='line_5723'>treasurer to give to them great and large gifts, and to pay all their</a>
<a id='line_5724'>dispenses, and assigned Sir Cador to convey them out of the land. And</a>
<a id='line_5725'>so they took their leave and departed, and took their shipping at</a>
<a id='line_5726'>Sandwich, and passed forth by Flanders, Almaine, the mountains, and all</a>
<a id='line_5727'>Italy, until they came unto Lucius. And after the reverence made, they</a>
<a id='line_5728'>made relation of their answer, like as ye to-fore have heard.</a>
<a id='line_5729'></a>
<a id='line_5730'>When the Emperor Lucius had well understood their credence, he was sore</a>
<a id='line_5731'>moved as he had been all araged, and said, I had supposed that Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5732'>would have obeyed to my commandment, and have served you himself, as</a>
<a id='line_5733'>him well beseemed or any other king to do. O Sir, said one of the</a>
<a id='line_5734'>senators, let be such vain words, for we let you wit that I and my</a>
<a id='line_5735'>fellows were full sore afeard to behold his countenance; I fear me ye</a>
<a id='line_5736'>have made a rod for yourself, for he intendeth to be lord of this</a>
<a id='line_5737'>empire, which sore is to be doubted if he come, for he is all another</a>
<a id='line_5738'>man than ye ween, and holdeth the most noble court of the world, all</a>
<a id='line_5739'>other kings nor princes may not compare unto his noble maintenance. On</a>
<a id='line_5740'>New Year’s Day we saw him in his estate, which was the royalest that</a>
<a id='line_5741'>ever we saw, for he was served at his table with nine kings, and the</a>
<a id='line_5742'>noblest fellowship of other princes, lords, and knights that be in the</a>
<a id='line_5743'>world, and every knight approved and like a lord, and holdeth Table</a>
<a id='line_5744'>Round: and in his person the most manly man that liveth, and is like to</a>
<a id='line_5745'>conquer all the world, for unto his courage it is too little: wherefore</a>
<a id='line_5746'>I advise you to keep well your marches and straits in the mountains;</a>
<a id='line_5747'>for certainly he is a lord to be doubted. Well, said Lucius, before</a>
<a id='line_5748'>Easter I suppose to pass the mountains, and so forth into France, and</a>
<a id='line_5749'>there bereave him his lands with Genoese and other mighty warriors of</a>
<a id='line_5750'>Tuscany and Lombardy. And I shall send for them all that be subjects</a>
<a id='line_5751'>and allied to the empire of Rome to come to mine aid. And forthwith</a>
<a id='line_5752'>sent old wise knights unto these countries following: first to Ambage</a>
<a id='line_5753'>and Arrage, to Alexandria, to India, to Armenia, whereas the river of</a>
<a id='line_5754'>Euphrates runneth into Asia, to Africa, and Europe the Large, to</a>
<a id='line_5755'>Ertayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt, and to Damascus, to Damietta and</a>
<a id='line_5756'>Cayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus, Turkey, Pontus and Pamphylia, to Syria</a>
<a id='line_5757'>and Galatia. And all these were subject to Rome and many more, as</a>
<a id='line_5758'>Greece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria, Cateland, Portugal, with many</a>
<a id='line_5759'>thousands of Spaniards. Thus all these kings, dukes, and admirals,</a>
<a id='line_5760'>assembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at once, with great multitude</a>
<a id='line_5761'>of people. When the emperor understood their coming he made ready his</a>
<a id='line_5762'>Romans and all the people between him and Flanders.</a>
<a id='line_5763'></a>
<a id='line_5764'>Also he had gotten with him fifty giants which had been engendered of</a>
<a id='line_5765'>fiends; and they were ordained to guard his person, and to break the</a>
<a id='line_5766'>front of the battle of King Arthur. And thus departed from Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_5767'>came down the mountains for to destroy the lands that Arthur had</a>
<a id='line_5768'>conquered, and came unto Cologne, and besieged a castle thereby, and</a>
<a id='line_5769'>won it soon, and stuffed it with two hundred Saracens or Infidels, and</a>
<a id='line_5770'>after destroyed many fair countries which Arthur had won of King</a>
<a id='line_5771'>Claudas. And thus Lucius came with all his host, which were disperplyd</a>
<a id='line_5772'>sixty mile in breadth, and commanded them to meet with him in Burgoyne,</a>
<a id='line_5773'>for he purposed to destroy the realm of Little Britain.</a>

<a id='line_5778'>ordained the realm should be governed in his absence.</a>
<a id='line_5779'></a>
<a id='line_5780'>Now leave we of Lucius the Emperor and speak we of King Arthur, that</a>
<a id='line_5781'>commanded all them of his retinue to be ready at the utas of Hilary for</a>
<a id='line_5782'>to hold a parliament at York. And at that parliament was concluded to</a>
<a id='line_5783'>arrest all the navy of the land, and to be ready within fifteen days at</a>
<a id='line_5784'>Sandwich, and there he showed to his army how he purposed to conquer</a>
<a id='line_5785'>the empire which he ought to have of right. And there he ordained two</a>
<a id='line_5786'>governors of this realm, that is to say, Sir Baudwin of Britain, for to</a>
<a id='line_5787'>counsel to the best, and Sir Constantine, son to Sir Cador of Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_5788'>which after the death of Arthur was king of this realm. And in the</a>
<a id='line_5789'>presence of all his lords he resigned the rule of the realm and</a>
<a id='line_5790'>Guenever his queen to them, wherefore Sir Launcelot was wroth, for he</a>
<a id='line_5791'>left Sir Tristram with King Mark for the love of Beale Isould. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5792'>Queen Guenever made great sorrow for the departing of her lord and</a>
<a id='line_5793'>other, and swooned in such wise that the ladies bare her into her</a>
<a id='line_5794'>chamber. Thus the king with his great army departed, leaving the queen</a>
<a id='line_5795'>and realm in the governance of Sir Baudwin and Constantine. And when he</a>
<a id='line_5796'>was on his horse he said with an high voice, If I die in this journey I</a>
<a id='line_5797'>will that Sir Constantine be mine heir and king crowned of this realm</a>
<a id='line_5798'>as next of my blood. And after departed and entered into the sea at</a>
<a id='line_5799'>Sandwich with all his army, with a great multitude of ships, galleys,</a>
<a id='line_5800'>cogs, and dromounds, sailing on the sea.</a>

<a id='line_5803'></a>
<a id='line_5804'>CHAPTER IV. How King Arthur being shipped and lying in his cabin had a</a>
<a id='line_5805'>marvellous dream and of the exposition thereof.</a>
<a id='line_5806'></a>
<a id='line_5807'>And as the king lay in his cabin in the ship, he fell in a slumbering</a>
<a id='line_5808'>and dreamed a marvellous dream: him seemed that a dreadful dragon did</a>
<a id='line_5809'>drown much of his people, and he came flying out of the west, and his</a>
<a id='line_5810'>head was enamelled with azure, and his shoulders shone as gold, his</a>
<a id='line_5811'>belly like mails of a marvellous hue, his tail full of tatters, his</a>
<a id='line_5812'>feet full of fine sable, and his claws like fine gold; and an hideous</a>
<a id='line_5813'>flame of fire flew out of his mouth, like as the land and water had</a>
<a id='line_5814'>flamed all of fire. After, him seemed there came out of the orient, a</a>
<a id='line_5815'>grimly boar all black in a cloud, and his paws as big as a post; he was</a>
<a id='line_5816'>rugged looking roughly, he was the foulest beast that ever man saw, he</a>
<a id='line_5817'>roared and romed so hideously that it were marvel to hear. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5818'>dreadful dragon advanced him and came in the wind like a falcon giving</a>
<a id='line_5819'>great strokes on the boar, and the boar hit him again with his grizzly</a>
<a id='line_5820'>tusks that his breast was all bloody, and that the hot blood made all</a>
<a id='line_5821'>the sea red of his blood. Then the dragon flew away all on an height,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>and came down with such a swough, and smote the boar on the ridge,</a>
<a id='line_5823'>which was ten foot large from the head to the tail, and smote the boar</a>
<a id='line_5824'>all to powder both flesh and bones, that it flittered all abroad on the</a>
<a id='line_5825'>sea.</a>
<a id='line_5826'></a>
<a id='line_5827'>And therewith the king awoke anon, and was sore abashed of this dream,</a>
<a id='line_5828'>and sent anon for a wise philosopher, commanding to tell him the</a>
<a id='line_5829'>signification of his dream. Sir, said the philosopher, the dragon that</a>
<a id='line_5830'>thou dreamedst of betokeneth thine own person that sailest here, and</a>
<a id='line_5831'>the colours of his wings be thy realms that thou hast won, and his tail</a>
<a id='line_5832'>which is all to-tattered signifieth the noble knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_5833'>Table; and the boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds</a>
<a id='line_5834'>betokeneth some tyrant that tormenteth the people, or else thou art</a>
<a id='line_5835'>like to fight with some giant thyself, being horrible and abominable,</a>
<a id='line_5836'>whose peer ye saw never in your days, wherefore of this dreadful dream</a>
<a id='line_5837'>doubt thee nothing, but as a conqueror come forth thyself.</a>
<a id='line_5838'></a>
<a id='line_5839'>Then after this soon they had sight of land, and sailed till they</a>
<a id='line_5840'>arrived at Barflete in Flanders, and when they were there he found many</a>
<a id='line_5841'>of his great lords ready, as they had been commanded to wait upon him.</a>
<a id='line_5842'></a>
<a id='line_5843'></a>
<a id='line_5844'></a>
<a id='line_5845'>CHAPTER V. How a man of the country told to him of a marvellous giant,</a>
<a id='line_5846'>and how he fought and conquered him.</a>
<a id='line_5847'></a>
<a id='line_5848'>Then came to him an husbandman of the country, and told him how there</a>
<a id='line_5849'>was in the country of Constantine beside Brittany, a great giant which</a>
<a id='line_5850'>had slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country, and had</a>
<a id='line_5851'>been sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that</a>
<a id='line_5852'>land, insomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed; and</a>
<a id='line_5853'>now late he hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she rode with her</a>
<a id='line_5854'>meiny, and hath led her to his lodging which is in a mountain, for to</a>
<a id='line_5855'>ravish and lie by her to her life’s end, and many people followed her,</a>
<a id='line_5856'>more than five hundred, but all they might not rescue her, but they</a>
<a id='line_5857'>left her shrieking and crying lamentably, wherefore I suppose that he</a>
<a id='line_5858'>hath slain her in fulfilling his foul lust of lechery. She was wife</a>
<a id='line_5859'>unto thy cousin Sir Howell, whom we call full nigh of thy blood. Now,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>as thou art a rightful king, have pity on this lady, and revenge us all</a>
<a id='line_5861'>as thou art a noble conqueror. Alas, said King Arthur, this is a great</a>
<a id='line_5862'>mischief, I had liefer than the best realm that I have that I had been</a>
<a id='line_5863'>a furlong way to-fore him for to have rescued that lady. Now, fellow,</a>
<a id='line_5864'>said King Arthur, canst thou bring me thereas this giant haunteth? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_5865'>Sir, said the good man, look yonder whereas thou seest those two great</a>
<a id='line_5866'>fires, there shalt thou find him, and more treasure than I suppose is</a>
<a id='line_5867'>in all France. When the king had understood this piteous case, he</a>
<a id='line_5868'>returned into his tent.</a>
<a id='line_5869'></a>
<a id='line_5870'>Then he called to him Sir Kay and Sir Bedivere, and commanded them</a>
<a id='line_5871'>secretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them twain;</a>
<a id='line_5872'>for after evensong he would ride on pilgrimage with them two only unto</a>
<a id='line_5873'>Saint Michael’s mount. And then anon he made him ready, and armed him</a>
<a id='line_5874'>at all points, and took his horse and his shield. And so they three</a>
<a id='line_5875'>departed thence and rode forth as fast as ever they might till that</a>
<a id='line_5876'>they came to the foreland of that mount. And there they alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_5877'>the king commanded them to tarry there, for he would himself go up into</a>
<a id='line_5878'>that mount. And so he ascended up into that hill till he came to a</a>
<a id='line_5879'>great fire, and there he found a careful widow wringing her hands and</a>
<a id='line_5880'>making great sorrow, sitting by a grave new made. And then King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5881'>saluted her, and demanded of her wherefore she made such lamentation,</a>
<a id='line_5882'>to whom she answered and said, Sir knight, speak soft, for yonder is a</a>
<a id='line_5883'>devil, if he hear thee speak he will come and destroy thee; I hold thee</a>
<a id='line_5884'>unhappy; what dost thou here in this mountain? for if ye were such</a>
<a id='line_5885'>fifty as ye be, ye were not able to make resistance against this devil:</a>
<a id='line_5886'>here lieth a duchess dead, the which was the fairest of all the world,</a>
<a id='line_5887'>wife to Sir Howell, Duke of Brittany, he hath murdered her in forcing</a>
<a id='line_5888'>her, and hath slit her unto the navel.</a>
<a id='line_5889'></a>
<a id='line_5890'>Dame, said the king, I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur, for</a>
<a id='line_5891'>to treat with that tyrant for his liege people. Fie on such treaties,</a>
<a id='line_5892'>said she, he setteth not by the king nor by no man else; but an if thou</a>
<a id='line_5893'>have brought Arthur’s wife, dame Guenever, he shall be gladder than</a>
<a id='line_5894'>thou hadst given to him half France. Beware, approach him not too nigh,</a>
<a id='line_5895'>for he hath vanquished fifteen kings, and hath made him a coat full of</a>
<a id='line_5896'>precious stones embroidered with their beards, which they sent him to</a>
<a id='line_5897'>have his love for salvation of their people at this last Christmas. And</a>
<a id='line_5898'>if thou wilt, speak with him at yonder great fire at supper. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_5899'>Arthur, I will accomplish my message for all your fearful words; and</a>
<a id='line_5900'>went forth by the crest of that hill, and saw where he sat at supper</a>
<a id='line_5901'>gnawing on a limb of a man, baking his broad limbs by the fire, and</a>
<a id='line_5902'>breechless, and three fair damosels turning three broaches whereon were</a>
<a id='line_5903'>broached twelve young children late born, like young birds.</a>
<a id='line_5904'></a>
<a id='line_5905'>When King Arthur beheld that piteous sight he had great compassion on</a>
<a id='line_5906'>them, so that his heart bled for sorrow, and hailed him, saying in this</a>
<a id='line_5907'>wise: He that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful</a>
<a id='line_5908'>death; and the devil have thy soul; why hast thou murdered these young</a>
<a id='line_5909'>innocent children, and murdered this duchess? Therefore, arise and</a>
<a id='line_5910'>dress thee, thou glutton, for this day shalt thou die of my hand. Then</a>
<a id='line_5911'>the glutton anon started up, and took a great club in his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_5912'>smote at the king that his coronal fell to the earth. And the king hit</a>
<a id='line_5913'>him again that he carved his belly and cut off his genitours, that his</a>
<a id='line_5914'>guts and his entrails fell down to the ground. Then the giant threw</a>
<a id='line_5915'>away his club, and caught the king in his arms that he crushed his</a>
<a id='line_5916'>ribs. Then the three maidens kneeled down and called to Christ for help</a>
<a id='line_5917'>and comfort of Arthur. And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he was</a>
<a id='line_5918'>other while under and another time above. And so weltering and</a>
<a id='line_5919'>wallowing they rolled down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and</a>
<a id='line_5920'>ever as they so weltered Arthur smote him with his dagger.</a>
<a id='line_5921'></a>
<a id='line_5922'>And it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two knights were and</a>
<a id='line_5923'>kept Arthur’s horse; then when they saw the king fast in the giant’s</a>
<a id='line_5924'>arms they came and loosed him. And then the king commanded Sir Kay to</a>
<a id='line_5925'>smite off the giant’s head, and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear,</a>
<a id='line_5926'>and bear it to Sir Howell, and tell him that his enemy was slain; and</a>
<a id='line_5927'>after let this head be bound to a barbican that all the people may see</a>
<a id='line_5928'>and behold it; and go ye two up to the mountain, and fetch me my</a>
<a id='line_5929'>shield, my sword, and the club of iron; and as for the treasure, take</a>
<a id='line_5930'>ye it, for ye shall find there goods out of number; so I have the</a>
<a id='line_5931'>kirtle and the club I desire no more. This was the fiercest giant that</a>
<a id='line_5932'>ever I met with, save one in the mount of Araby, which I overcame, but</a>
<a id='line_5933'>this was greater and fiercer. Then the knights fetched the club and the</a>
<a id='line_5934'>kirtle, and some of the treasure they took to themselves, and returned</a>
<a id='line_5935'>again to the host. And anon this was known through all the country,</a>
<a id='line_5936'>wherefore the people came and thanked the king. And he said again, Give</a>
<a id='line_5937'>the thanks to God, and depart the goods among you.</a>
<a id='line_5938'></a>
<a id='line_5939'>And after that King Arthur said and commanded his cousin Howell, that</a>
<a id='line_5940'>he should ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the</a>
<a id='line_5941'>worship of Saint Michael. And on the morn the king removed with his</a>
<a id='line_5942'>great battle, and came into Champayne and in a valley, and there they</a>
<a id='line_5943'>pight their tents; and the king being set at his dinner, there came in</a>
<a id='line_5944'>two messengers, of whom that one was Marshal of France, and said to the</a>
<a id='line_5945'>king that the emperor was entered into France, and had destroyed a</a>
<a id='line_5946'>great part, and was in Burgoyne, and had destroyed and made great</a>
<a id='line_5947'>slaughter of people, and burnt towns and boroughs; wherefore, if thou</a>
<a id='line_5948'>come not hastily, they must yield up their bodies and goods.</a>
<a id='line_5949'></a>
<a id='line_5950'></a>
<a id='line_5951'></a>
<a id='line_5952'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur sent Sir Gawaine and other to Lucius, and</a>
<a id='line_5953'>how they were assailed and escaped with worship.</a>
<a id='line_5954'></a>
<a id='line_5955'>Then the king did do call Sir Gawaine, Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5956'>Bedivere, and commanded them to go straight to Sir Lucius, and say ye</a>
<a id='line_5957'>to him that hastily he remove out of my land; and if he will not, bid</a>
<a id='line_5958'>him make him ready to battle and not distress the poor people. Then</a>
<a id='line_5959'>anon these noble knights dressed them to horseback, and when they came</a>
<a id='line_5960'>to the green wood, they saw many pavilions set in a meadow, of silk of</a>
<a id='line_5961'>divers colours, beside a river, and the emperor’s pavilion was in the</a>
<a id='line_5962'>middle with an eagle displayed above. To the which tent our knights</a>
<a id='line_5963'>rode toward, and ordained Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors to do the message,</a>
<a id='line_5964'>and left in a bushment Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5965'>Gawaine and Sir Bors did their message, and commanded Lucius, in</a>
<a id='line_5966'>Arthur’s name to avoid his land, or shortly to address him to battle.</a>
<a id='line_5967'>To whom Lucius answered and said, Ye shall return to your lord, and say</a>
<a id='line_5968'>ye to him that I shall subdue him and all his lands. Then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_5969'>was wroth and said, I had liefer than all France fight against thee;</a>
<a id='line_5970'>and so had I, said Sir Bors, liefer than all Brittany or Burgoyne.</a>
<a id='line_5971'></a>
<a id='line_5972'>Then a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor, said, Lo,</a>
<a id='line_5973'>how these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag as though</a>
<a id='line_5974'>they bare up all the world. Then Sir Gawaine was sore grieved with</a>
<a id='line_5975'>these words, and pulled out his sword and smote off his head. And</a>
<a id='line_5976'>therewith turned their horses and rode over waters and through woods</a>
<a id='line_5977'>till they came to their bushment, whereas Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_5978'>were hoving. The Romans followed fast after, on horseback and on foot,</a>
<a id='line_5979'>over a champaign unto a wood; then Sir Bors turned his horse and saw a</a>
<a id='line_5980'>knight come fast on, whom he smote through the body with a spear that</a>
<a id='line_5981'>he fell dead down to the earth; then came Caliburn one of the strongest</a>
<a id='line_5982'>of Pavie, and smote down many of Arthur’s knights. And when Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_5983'>saw him do so much harm, he addressed toward him, and smote him through</a>
<a id='line_5984'>the breast, that he fell down dead to the earth. Then Sir Feldenak</a>
<a id='line_5985'>thought to revenge the death of Gainus upon Sir Gawaine, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_5986'>Gawaine was ware thereof, and smote him on the head, which stroke</a>
<a id='line_5987'>stinted not till it came to his breast. And then he returned and came</a>
<a id='line_5988'>to his fellows in the bushment. And there was a recounter, for the</a>
<a id='line_5989'>bushment brake on the Romans, and slew and hew down the Romans, and</a>
<a id='line_5990'>forced the Romans to flee and return, whom the noble knights chased</a>
<a id='line_5991'>unto their tents.</a>
<a id='line_5992'></a>
<a id='line_5993'>Then the Romans gathered more people, and also footmen came on, and</a>
<a id='line_5994'>there was a new battle, and so much people that Sir Bors and Sir Berel</a>
<a id='line_5995'>were taken. But when Sir Gawaine saw that, he took with him Sir Idrus</a>
<a id='line_5996'>the good knight, and said he would never see King Arthur but if he</a>
<a id='line_5997'>rescued them, and pulled out Galatine his good sword, and followed them</a>
<a id='line_5998'>that led those two knights away; and he smote him that led Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_5999'>and took Sir Bors from him and delivered him to his fellows. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_6000'>Idrus in likewise rescued Sir Berel. Then began the battle to be great,</a>
<a id='line_6001'>that our knights were in great jeopardy, wherefore Sir Gawaine sent to</a>
<a id='line_6002'>King Arthur for succour, and that he hie him, for I am sore wounded,</a>
<a id='line_6003'>and that our prisoners may pay goods out of number. And the messenger</a>
<a id='line_6004'>came to the king and told him his message. And anon the king did do</a>
<a id='line_6005'>assemble his army, but anon, or he departed the prisoners were come,</a>
<a id='line_6006'>and Sir Gawaine and his fellows gat the field and put the Romans to</a>
<a id='line_6007'>flight, and after returned and came with their fellowship in such wise</a>
<a id='line_6008'>that no man of worship was lost of them, save that Sir Gawaine was sore</a>
<a id='line_6009'>hurt. Then the king did do ransack his wounds and comforted him. And</a>
<a id='line_6010'>thus was the beginning of the first journey of the Britons and Romans,</a>
<a id='line_6011'>and there were slain of the Romans more than ten thousand, and great</a>
<a id='line_6012'>joy and mirth was made that night in the host of King Arthur. And on</a>
<a id='line_6013'>the morn he sent all the prisoners into Paris under the guard of Sir</a>
<a id='line_6014'>Launcelot, with many knights, and of Sir Cador.</a>
<a id='line_6015'></a>
<a id='line_6016'></a>
<a id='line_6017'></a>
<a id='line_6018'>CHAPTER VII. How Lucius sent certain spies in a bushment for to have</a>
<a id='line_6019'>taken his knights being prisoners, and how they were letted.</a>
<a id='line_6020'></a>
<a id='line_6021'>Now turn we to the Emperor of Rome, which espied that these prisoners</a>
<a id='line_6022'>should be sent to Paris, and anon he sent to lie in a bushment certain</a>
<a id='line_6023'>knights and princes with sixty thousand men, for to rescue his knights</a>
<a id='line_6024'>and lords that were prisoners. And so on the morn as Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6025'>Cador, chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the</a>
<a id='line_6026'>prisoners, as they should pass through a wood, Sir Launcelot sent</a>
<a id='line_6027'>certain knights to espy if any were in the woods to let them. And when</a>
<a id='line_6028'>the said knights came into the wood, anon they espied and saw the great</a>
<a id='line_6029'>embushment, and returned and told Sir Launcelot that there lay in await</a>
<a id='line_6030'>for them three score thousand Romans. And then Sir Launcelot with such</a>
<a id='line_6031'>knights as he had, and men of war to the number of ten thousand, put</a>
<a id='line_6032'>them in array, and met with them and fought with them manly, and slew</a>
<a id='line_6033'>and detrenched many of the Romans, and slew many knights and admirals</a>
<a id='line_6034'>of the party of the Romans and Saracens; there was slain the king of</a>
<a id='line_6035'>Lyly and three great lords, Aladuke, Herawd, and Heringdale. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_6036'>Launcelot fought so nobly that no man might endure a stroke of his</a>
<a id='line_6037'>hand, but where he came he showed his prowess and might, for he slew</a>
<a id='line_6038'>down right on every side; and the Romans and Saracens fled from him as</a>
<a id='line_6039'>the sheep from the wolf or from the lion, and put them, all that abode</a>
<a id='line_6040'>alive, to flight.</a>
<a id='line_6041'></a>
<a id='line_6042'>And so long they fought that tidings came to King Arthur, and anon he</a>
<a id='line_6043'>graithed him and came to the battle, and saw his knights how they had</a>
<a id='line_6044'>vanquished the battle, he embraced them knight by knight in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_6045'>and said, Ye be worthy to wield all your honour and worship; there was</a>
<a id='line_6046'>never king save myself that had so noble knights. Sir, said Cador,</a>
<a id='line_6047'>there was none of us failed other, but of the prowess and manhood of</a>
<a id='line_6048'>Sir Launcelot were more than wonder to tell, and also of his cousins</a>
<a id='line_6049'>which did that day many noble feats of war. And also Sir Cador told who</a>
<a id='line_6050'>of his knights were slain, as Sir Berel, and other Sir Moris and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6051'>Maurel, two good knights. Then the king wept, and dried his eyes with a</a>
<a id='line_6052'>kerchief, and said, Your courage had near-hand destroyed you, for</a>
<a id='line_6053'>though ye had returned again, ye had lost no worship; for I call it</a>
<a id='line_6054'>folly, knights to abide when they be overmatched. Nay, said Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6055'>and the other, for once shamed may never be recovered.</a>

<a id='line_6057'></a>
<a id='line_6058'></a>
<a id='line_6059'>CHAPTER VIII. How a senator told to Lucius of their discomfiture, and</a>
<a id='line_6060'>also of the great battle between Arthur and Lucius.</a>
<a id='line_6061'></a>
<a id='line_6062'>Now leave we King Arthur and his noble knights which had won the field,</a>
<a id='line_6063'>and had brought their prisoners to Paris, and speak we of a senator</a>
<a id='line_6064'>which escaped from the battle, and came to Lucius the emperor, and said</a>
<a id='line_6065'>to him, Sir emperor, I advise thee for to withdraw thee; what dost thou</a>
<a id='line_6066'>here? thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great strokes out of</a>
<a id='line_6067'>all measure, for this day one of Arthur’s knights was worth in the</a>
<a id='line_6068'>battle an hundred of ours. Fie on thee, said Lucius, thou speakest</a>
<a id='line_6069'>cowardly; for thy words grieve me more than all the loss that I had</a>
<a id='line_6070'>this day. And anon he sent forth a king, which hight Sir Leomie, with a</a>
<a id='line_6071'>great army, and bade him hie him fast to-fore, and he would follow</a>
<a id='line_6072'>hastily after. King Arthur was warned privily, and sent his people to</a>
<a id='line_6073'>Sessoine, and took up the towns and castles from the Romans. Then the</a>
<a id='line_6074'>king commanded Sir Cador to take the rearward, and to take with him</a>
<a id='line_6075'>certain knights of the Round Table, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6076'>Kay, Sir Marrok, with Sir Marhaus, shall await on our person. Thus the</a>
<a id='line_6077'>King Arthur disperpled his host in divers parties, to the end that his</a>
<a id='line_6078'>enemies should not escape.</a>
<a id='line_6079'></a>
<a id='line_6080'>When the emperor was entered into the vale of Sessoine, he might see</a>
<a id='line_6081'>where King Arthur was embattled and his banner displayed; and he was</a>
<a id='line_6082'>beset round about with his enemies, that needs he must fight or yield</a>
<a id='line_6083'>him, for he might not flee, but said openly unto the Romans, Sirs, I</a>
<a id='line_6084'>admonish you that this day ye fight and acquit you as men, and remember</a>
<a id='line_6085'>how Rome domineth and is chief and head over all the earth and</a>
<a id='line_6086'>universal world, and suffer not these Britons this day to abide against</a>
<a id='line_6087'>us; and therewith he did command his trumpets to blow the bloody</a>
<a id='line_6088'>sounds, in such wise that the ground trembled and dindled.</a>
<a id='line_6089'></a>
<a id='line_6090'>Then the battles approached and shoved and shouted on both sides, and</a>
<a id='line_6091'>great strokes were smitten on both sides, many men overthrown, hurt,</a>
<a id='line_6092'>and slain; and great valiances, prowesses and appertices of war were</a>
<a id='line_6093'>that day showed, which were over long to recount the noble feats of</a>
<a id='line_6094'>every man, for they should contain an whole volume. But in especial,</a>
<a id='line_6095'>King Arthur rode in the battle exhorting his knights to do well, and</a>
<a id='line_6096'>himself did as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do; he</a>
<a id='line_6097'>drew out Excalibur his sword, and awaited ever whereas the Romans were</a>
<a id='line_6098'>thickest and most grieved his people, and anon he addressed him on that</a>
<a id='line_6099'>part, and hew and slew down right, and rescued his people; and he slew</a>
<a id='line_6100'>a great giant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and</a>
<a id='line_6101'>height, he shorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees,</a>
<a id='line_6102'>saying, Now art thou better of a size to deal with than thou were, and</a>
<a id='line_6103'>after smote off his head. There Sir Gawaine fought nobly and slew three</a>
<a id='line_6104'>admirals in that battle. And so did all the knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_6105'>Thus the battle between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor endured</a>
<a id='line_6106'>long. Lucius had on his side many Saracens which were slain. And thus</a>
<a id='line_6107'>the battle was great, and oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and</a>
<a id='line_6108'>anon at an afterdeal, which endured so long till at the last King</a>
<a id='line_6109'>Arthur espied where Lucius the Emperor fought, and did wonder with his</a>
<a id='line_6110'>own hands. And anon he rode to him. And either smote other fiercely,</a>
<a id='line_6111'>and at last Lucius smote Arthur thwart the visage, and gave him a large</a>
<a id='line_6112'>wound. And when King Arthur felt himself hurt, anon he smote him again</a>
<a id='line_6113'>with Excalibur that it cleft his head, from the summit of his head, and</a>
<a id='line_6114'>stinted not till it came to his breast. And then the emperor fell down</a>
<a id='line_6115'>dead and there ended his life.</a>
<a id='line_6116'></a>
<a id='line_6117'>And when it was known that the emperor was slain, anon all the Romans</a>
<a id='line_6118'>with all their host put them to flight, and King Arthur with all his</a>
<a id='line_6119'>knights followed the chase, and slew down right all them that they</a>
<a id='line_6120'>might attain. And thus was the victory given to King Arthur, and the</a>
<a id='line_6121'>triumph; and there were slain on the part of Lucius more than an</a>
<a id='line_6122'>hundred thousand. And after King Arthur did do ransack the dead bodies,</a>
<a id='line_6123'>and did do bury them that were slain of his retinue, every man</a>
<a id='line_6124'>according to the estate and degree that he was of. And them that were</a>
<a id='line_6125'>hurt he let the surgeons do search their hurts and wounds, and</a>
<a id='line_6126'>commanded to spare no salves nor medicines till they were whole.</a>
<a id='line_6127'></a>
<a id='line_6128'>Then the king rode straight to the place where the Emperor Lucius lay</a>
<a id='line_6129'>dead, and with him he found slain the Soudan of Syria, the King of</a>
<a id='line_6130'>Egypt and of Ethiopia, which were two noble kings, with seventeen other</a>
<a id='line_6131'>kings of divers regions, and also sixty senators of Rome, all noble</a>
<a id='line_6132'>men, whom the king did do balm and gum with many good gums aromatic,</a>
<a id='line_6133'>and after did do cere them in sixty fold of cered cloth of sendal, and</a>
<a id='line_6134'>laid them in chests of lead, because they should not chafe nor savour,</a>
<a id='line_6135'>and upon all these bodies their shields with their arms and banners</a>
<a id='line_6136'>were set, to the end they should be known of what country they were.</a>
<a id='line_6137'>And after he found three senators which were alive, to whom he said,</a>
<a id='line_6138'>For to save your lives I will that ye take these dead bodies, and carry</a>
<a id='line_6139'>them with you unto great Rome, and present them to the Potestate on my</a>
<a id='line_6140'>behalf, shewing him my letters, and tell them that I in my person shall</a>
<a id='line_6141'>hastily be at Rome. And I suppose the Romans shall beware how they</a>
<a id='line_6142'>shall demand any tribute of me. And I command you to say when ye shall</a>
<a id='line_6143'>come to Rome, to the Potestate and all the Council and Senate, that I</a>
<a id='line_6144'>send to them these dead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded.</a>
<a id='line_6145'>And if they be not content with these, I shall pay more at my coming,</a>
<a id='line_6146'>for other tribute owe I none, nor none other will I pay. And methinketh</a>
<a id='line_6147'>this sufficeth for Britain, Ireland and all Almaine with Germany. And</a>
<a id='line_6148'>furthermore, I charge you to say to them, that I command them upon pain</a>
<a id='line_6149'>of their heads never to demand tribute nor tax of me nor of my lands.</a>
<a id='line_6150'>Then with this charge and commandment, the three senators aforesaid</a>
<a id='line_6151'>departed with all the said dead bodies, laying the body of Lucius in a</a>
<a id='line_6152'>car covered with the arms of the Empire all alone; and after alway two</a>
<a id='line_6153'>bodies of kings in a chariot, and then the bodies of the senators after</a>
<a id='line_6154'>them, and so went toward Rome, and showed their legation and message to</a>
<a id='line_6155'>the Potestate and Senate, recounting the battle done in France, and how</a>
<a id='line_6156'>the field was lost and much people and innumerable slain. Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_6157'>they advised them in no wise to move no more war against that noble</a>
<a id='line_6158'>conqueror Arthur, for his might and prowess is most to be doubted, seen</a>
<a id='line_6159'>the noble kings and great multitude of knights of the Round Table, to</a>
<a id='line_6160'>whom none earthly prince may compare.</a>

<a id='line_6163'></a>
<a id='line_6164'>CHAPTER IX. How Arthur, after he had achieved the battle against the</a>
<a id='line_6165'>Romans, entered into Almaine, and so into Italy.</a>
<a id='line_6166'></a>
<a id='line_6167'>Now turn we unto King Arthur and his noble knights, which, after the</a>
<a id='line_6168'>great battle achieved against the Romans, entered into Lorraine,</a>
<a id='line_6169'>Brabant and Flanders, and sithen returned into Haut Almaine, and so</a>
<a id='line_6170'>over the mountains into Lombardy, and after, into Tuscany wherein was a</a>
<a id='line_6171'>city which in no wise would yield themself nor obey, wherefore King</a>
<a id='line_6172'>Arthur besieged it, and lay long about it, and gave many assaults to</a>
<a id='line_6173'>the city; and they within defended them valiantly. Then, on a time, the</a>
<a id='line_6174'>king called Sir Florence, a knight, and said to him they lacked</a>
<a id='line_6175'>victual, And not far from hence be great forests and woods, wherein be</a>
<a id='line_6176'>many of mine enemies with much bestial: I will that thou make thee</a>
<a id='line_6177'>ready and go thither in foraying, and take with thee Sir Gawaine my</a>
<a id='line_6178'>nephew, Sir Wisshard, Sir Clegis, Sir Cleremond, and the Captain of</a>
<a id='line_6179'>Cardiff with other, and bring with you all the beasts that ye there can</a>
<a id='line_6180'>get.</a>
<a id='line_6181'></a>
<a id='line_6182'>And anon these knights made them ready, and rode over holts and hills,</a>
<a id='line_6183'>through forests and woods, till they came into a fair meadow full of</a>
<a id='line_6184'>fair flowers and grass; and there they rested them and their horses all</a>
<a id='line_6185'>that night. And in the springing of the day in the next morn, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6186'>Gawaine took his horse and stole away from his fellowship, to seek some</a>
<a id='line_6187'>adventures. And anon he was ware of a man armed, walking his horse</a>
<a id='line_6188'>easily by a wood’s side, and his shield laced to his shoulder, sitting</a>
<a id='line_6189'>on a strong courser, without any man saving a page bearing a mighty</a>
<a id='line_6190'>spear. The knight bare in his shield three griffins of gold, in sable</a>
<a id='line_6191'>carbuncle, the chief of silver. When Sir Gawaine espied this gay</a>
<a id='line_6192'>knight, he feutred his spear, and rode straight to him, and demanded of</a>
<a id='line_6193'>him from whence that he was. That other answered and said he was of</a>
<a id='line_6194'>Tuscany, and demanded of Sir Gawaine, What, profferest thou, proud</a>
<a id='line_6195'>knight, thee so boldly? here gettest thou no prey, thou mayest prove</a>
<a id='line_6196'>what thou wilt, for thou shalt be my prisoner or thou depart. Then said</a>
<a id='line_6197'>Gawaine, thou avauntest thee greatly and speakest proud words, I</a>
<a id='line_6198'>counsel thee for all thy boast that thou make thee ready, and take thy</a>
<a id='line_6199'>gear to thee, to-fore greater grame fall to thee.</a>

<a id='line_6203'>CHAPTER X. Of a battle done by Sir Gawaine against a Saracen, which</a>
<a id='line_6204'>after was yielden and became Christian.</a>
<a id='line_6205'></a>
<a id='line_6206'>Then they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might</a>
<a id='line_6207'>they had, and smote each other through their shields into their</a>
<a id='line_6208'>shoulders, wherefore anon they pulled out their swords, and smote great</a>
<a id='line_6209'>strokes that the fire sprang out of their helms. Then Sir Gawaine was</a>
<a id='line_6210'>all abashed, and with Galatine his good sword he smote through shield</a>
<a id='line_6211'>and thick hauberk made of thick mails, and all to-rushed and break the</a>
<a id='line_6212'>precious stones, and made him a large wound, that men might see both</a>
<a id='line_6213'>liver and lung. Then groaned that knight, and addressed him to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6214'>Gawaine, and with an awk stroke gave him a great wound and cut a vein,</a>
<a id='line_6215'>which grieved Gawaine sore, and he bled sore. Then the knight said to</a>
<a id='line_6216'>Sir Gawaine, bind thy wound or thy blee[ding] change, for thou</a>
<a id='line_6217'>be-bleedest all thy horse and thy fair arms, for all the barbers of</a>
<a id='line_6218'>Brittany shall not con staunch thy blood, for whosomever is hurt with</a>
<a id='line_6219'>this blade he shall never be staunched of bleeding. Then answered</a>
<a id='line_6220'>Gawaine, it grieveth me but little, thy great words shall not fear me</a>
<a id='line_6221'>nor lessen my courage, but thou shalt suffer teen and sorrow or we</a>
<a id='line_6222'>depart, but tell me in haste who may staunch my bleeding. That may I</a>
<a id='line_6223'>do, said the knight, if I will, and so will I if thou wilt succour and</a>
<a id='line_6224'>aid me, that I may be christened and believe on God, and thereof I</a>
<a id='line_6225'>require thee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit for thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_6226'>I grant, said Gawaine, so God help me, to accomplish all thy desire,</a>
<a id='line_6227'>but first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of what land</a>
<a id='line_6228'>and liegiance thou art of. Sir, he said, my name is Priamus, and a</a>
<a id='line_6229'>great prince is my father, and he hath been rebel unto Rome and</a>
<a id='line_6230'>overridden many of their lands. My father is lineally descended of</a>
<a id='line_6231'>Alexander and of Hector by right line. And Duke Joshua and Maccabaeus</a>
<a id='line_6232'>were of our lineage. I am right inheritor of Alexandria and Africa, and</a>
<a id='line_6233'>all the out isles, yet will I believe on thy Lord that thou believest</a>
<a id='line_6234'>on; and for thy labour I shall give thee treasure enough. I was so</a>
<a id='line_6235'>elate and hauteyn in my heart that I thought no man my peer, nor to me</a>
<a id='line_6236'>semblable. I was sent into this war with seven score knights, and now I</a>
<a id='line_6237'>have encountered with thee, which hast given to me of fighting my fill,</a>
<a id='line_6238'>wherefore sir knight, I pray thee to tell me what thou art. I am no</a>
<a id='line_6239'>knight, said Gawaine, I have been brought up in the guardrobe with the</a>
<a id='line_6240'>noble King Arthur many years, for to take heed to his armour and his</a>
<a id='line_6241'>other array, and to point his paltocks that long to himself. At Yule</a>
<a id='line_6242'>last he made me yeoman, and gave to me horse and harness, and an</a>
<a id='line_6243'>hundred pound in money; and if fortune be my friend, I doubt not but to</a>
<a id='line_6244'>be well advanced and holpen by my liege lord. Ah, said Priamus, if his</a>
<a id='line_6245'>knaves be so keen and fierce, his knights be passing good: now for the</a>
<a id='line_6246'>King’s love of Heaven, whether thou be a knave or a knight, tell thou</a>
<a id='line_6247'>me thy name. By God, said Sir Gawaine, now I will say thee sooth, my</a>
<a id='line_6248'>name is Sir Gawaine, and known I am in his court and in his chamber,</a>
<a id='line_6249'>and one of the knights of the Round Table, he dubbed me a duke with his</a>
<a id='line_6250'>own hand. Therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned, it is</a>
<a id='line_6251'>the goodness of God that lent to me my strength. Now am I better</a>
<a id='line_6252'>pleased, said Priamus, than thou hadst given to me all the Provence and</a>
<a id='line_6253'>Paris the rich. I had liefer to have been torn with wild horses, than</a>
<a id='line_6254'>any varlet had won such loos, or any page or priker should have had</a>
<a id='line_6255'>prize on me. But now sir knight I warn thee that hereby is a Duke of</a>
<a id='line_6256'>Lorraine with his army, and the noblest men of Dolphiny, and lords of</a>
<a id='line_6257'>Lombardy, with the garrison of Godard, and Saracens of Southland,</a>
<a id='line_6258'>y-numbered sixty thousand of good men of arms; wherefore but if we hie</a>
<a id='line_6259'>us hence, it will harm us both, for we be sore hurt, never like to</a>
<a id='line_6260'>recover; but take heed to my page, that he no horn blow, for if he do,</a>
<a id='line_6261'>there be hoving here fast by an hundred knights awaiting on my person,</a>
<a id='line_6262'>and if they take thee, there shall no ransom of gold nor silver acquit</a>
<a id='line_6263'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_6264'></a>
<a id='line_6265'>Then Sir Gawaine rode over a water for to save him, and the knight</a>
<a id='line_6266'>followed him, and so rode forth till they came to his fellows which</a>
<a id='line_6267'>were in the meadow, where they had been all the night. Anon as Sir</a>
<a id='line_6268'>Wisshard was ware of Sir Gawaine and saw that he was hurt, he ran to</a>
<a id='line_6269'>him sorrowfully weeping, and demanded of him who had so hurt him; and</a>
<a id='line_6270'>Gawaine told how he had foughten with that man, and each of them had</a>
<a id='line_6271'>hurt other, and how he had salves to heal them; but I can tell you</a>
<a id='line_6272'>other tidings, that soon we shall have ado with many enemies.</a>
<a id='line_6273'></a>
<a id='line_6274'>Then Sir Priamus and Sir Gawaine alighted, and let their horses graze</a>
<a id='line_6275'>in the meadow, and unarmed them, and then the blood ran freshly from</a>
<a id='line_6276'>their wounds. And Priamus took from his page a vial full of the four</a>
<a id='line_6277'>waters that came out of Paradise, and with certain balm anointed their</a>
<a id='line_6278'>wounds, and washed them with that water, and within an hour after they</a>
<a id='line_6279'>were both as whole as ever they were. And then with a trumpet were they</a>
<a id='line_6280'>all assembled to council, and there Priamus told unto them what lords</a>
<a id='line_6281'>and knights had sworn to rescue him, and that without fail they should</a>
<a id='line_6282'>be assailed with many thousands, wherefore he counselled them to</a>
<a id='line_6283'>withdraw them. Then Sir Gawaine said, it were great shame to them to</a>
<a id='line_6284'>avoid without any strokes; Wherefore I advise to take our arms and to</a>
<a id='line_6285'>make us ready to meet with these Saracens and misbelieving men, and</a>
<a id='line_6286'>with the help of God we shall overthrow them and have a fair day on</a>
<a id='line_6287'>them. And Sir Florence shall abide still in this field to keep the</a>
<a id='line_6288'>stale as a noble knight, and we shall not forsake yonder fellows. Now,</a>
<a id='line_6289'>said Priamus, cease your words, for I warn you ye shall find in yonder</a>
<a id='line_6290'>woods many perilous knights; they will put forth beasts to call you on,</a>
<a id='line_6291'>they be out of number, and ye are not past seven hundred, which be over</a>
<a id='line_6292'>few to fight with so many. Nevertheless, said Sir Gawaine, we shall</a>
<a id='line_6293'>once encounter them, and see what they can do, and the best shall have</a>
<a id='line_6294'>the victory.</a>
<a id='line_6295'></a>
<a id='line_6296'></a>
<a id='line_6297'></a>
<a id='line_6298'>CHAPTER XI. How the Saracens came out of a wood for to rescue their</a>
<a id='line_6299'>beasts, and of a great battle.</a>
<a id='line_6300'></a>
<a id='line_6301'>Then Sir Florence called to him Sir Floridas, with an hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_6302'>and drove forth the herd of beasts. Then followed him seven hundred men</a>
<a id='line_6303'>of arms; and Sir Ferant of Spain on a fair steed came springing out of</a>
<a id='line_6304'>the woods, and came to Sir Florence and asked him why he fled. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6305'>Florence took his spear and rode against him, and smote him in the</a>
<a id='line_6306'>forehead and brake his neck bone. Then all the other were moved, and</a>
<a id='line_6307'>thought to avenge the death of Sir Ferant, and smote in among them, and</a>
<a id='line_6308'>there was great fight, and many slain and laid down to ground, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6309'>Florence with his hundred knights alway kept the stale, and fought</a>
<a id='line_6310'>manly.</a>
<a id='line_6311'></a>
<a id='line_6312'>Then when Priamus the good knight perceived the great fight, he went to</a>
<a id='line_6313'>Sir Gawaine, and bade him that he should go and succour his fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_6314'>which were sore bestead with their enemies. Sir, grieve you not, said</a>
<a id='line_6315'>Sir Gawaine, for their gree shall be theirs. I shall not once move my</a>
<a id='line_6316'>horse to them ward, but if I see more than there be; for they be strong</a>
<a id='line_6317'>enough to match them.</a>
<a id='line_6318'></a>
<a id='line_6319'>And with that he saw an earl called Sir Ethelwold and the duke of</a>
<a id='line_6320'>Dutchmen, came leaping out of a wood with many thousands, and Priamus’</a>
<a id='line_6321'>knights, and came straight unto the battle. Then Sir Gawaine comforted</a>
<a id='line_6322'>his knights, and bade them not to be abashed, for all shall be ours.</a>
<a id='line_6323'>Then they began to wallop and met with their enemies, there were men</a>
<a id='line_6324'>slain and overthrown on every side. Then thrust in among them the</a>
<a id='line_6325'>knights of the Table Round, and smote down to the earth all them that</a>
<a id='line_6326'>withstood them, in so much that they made them to recoil and flee. By</a>
<a id='line_6327'>God, said Sir Gawaine, this gladdeth my heart, for now be they less in</a>
<a id='line_6328'>number by twenty thousand. Then entered into the battle Jubance a</a>
<a id='line_6329'>giant, and fought and slew down right, and distressed many of our</a>
<a id='line_6330'>knights, among whom was slain Sir Gherard, a knight of Wales. Then our</a>
<a id='line_6331'>knights took heart to them, and slew many Saracens. And then came in</a>
<a id='line_6332'>Sir Priamus with his pennon, and rode with the knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_6333'>Table, and fought so manfully that many of their enemies lost their</a>
<a id='line_6334'>lives. And there Sir Priamus slew the Marquis of Moises land, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6335'>Gawaine with his fellows so quit them that they had the field, but in</a>
<a id='line_6336'>that stour was Sir Chestelaine, a child and ward of Sir Gawaine slain,</a>
<a id='line_6337'>wherefore was much sorrow made, and his death was soon avenged. Thus</a>
<a id='line_6338'>was the battle ended, and many lords of Lombardy and Saracens left dead</a>
<a id='line_6339'>in the field.</a>
<a id='line_6340'></a>
<a id='line_6341'>Then Sir Florence and Sir Gawaine harboured surely their people, and</a>
<a id='line_6342'>took great plenty of bestial, of gold and silver, and great treasure</a>
<a id='line_6343'>and riches, and returned unto King Arthur, which lay still at the</a>
<a id='line_6344'>siege. And when they came to the king they presented their prisoners</a>
<a id='line_6345'>and recounted their adventures, and how they had vanquished their</a>
<a id='line_6346'>enemies.</a>

<a id='line_6351'>prisoners, and how the King won a city, and how he was crowned Emperor.</a>
<a id='line_6352'></a>
<a id='line_6353'>Now thanked be God, said the noble King Arthur. But what manner man is</a>
<a id='line_6354'>he that standeth by himself, him seemeth no prisoner. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_6355'>Gawaine, this is a good man of arms, he hath matched me, but he is</a>
<a id='line_6356'>yielden unto God, and to me, for to become Christian; had not he have</a>
<a id='line_6357'>been we should never have returned, wherefore I pray you that he may be</a>
<a id='line_6358'>baptised, for there liveth not a nobler man nor better knight of his</a>
<a id='line_6359'>hands. Then the king let him anon be christened, and did do call him</a>
<a id='line_6360'>his first name Priamus, and made him a duke and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_6361'>Round. And then anon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there</a>
<a id='line_6362'>was rearing of ladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that</a>
<a id='line_6363'>men with little pain might enter into the city. Then came out a</a>
<a id='line_6364'>duchess, and Clarisin the countess, with many ladies and damosels, and</a>
<a id='line_6365'>kneeling before King Arthur, required him for the love of God to</a>
<a id='line_6366'>receive the city, and not to take it by assault, for then should many</a>
<a id='line_6367'>guiltless be slain. Then the king avaled his visor with a meek and</a>
<a id='line_6368'>noble countenance, and said, Madam, there shall none of my subjects</a>
<a id='line_6369'>misdo you nor your maidens, nor to none that to you belong, but the</a>
<a id='line_6370'>duke shall abide my judgment. Then anon the king commanded to leave the</a>
<a id='line_6371'>assault, and anon the duke’s oldest son brought out the keys, and</a>
<a id='line_6372'>kneeling delivered them to the king, and besought him of grace; and the</a>
<a id='line_6373'>king seized the town by assent of his lords, and took the duke and sent</a>
<a id='line_6374'>him to Dover, there for to abide prisoner term of his life, and</a>
<a id='line_6375'>assigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her</a>
<a id='line_6376'>children.</a>
<a id='line_6377'></a>
<a id='line_6378'>Then he made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought to do</a>
<a id='line_6379'>in his own country; and after he took his journey toward Rome, and sent</a>
<a id='line_6380'>Sir Floris and Sir Floridas to-fore, with five hundred men of arms, and</a>
<a id='line_6381'>they came to the city of Urbino and laid there a bushment, thereas them</a>
<a id='line_6382'>seemed most best for them, and rode to-fore the town, where anon issued</a>
<a id='line_6383'>out much people and skirmished with the fore-riders. Then brake out the</a>
<a id='line_6384'>bushment and won the bridge, and after the town, and set upon the walls</a>
<a id='line_6385'>the king’s banner. Then came the king upon an hill, and saw the city</a>
<a id='line_6386'>and his banner on the walls, by which he knew that the city was won.</a>
<a id='line_6387'>And anon he sent and commanded that none of his liege men should defoul</a>
<a id='line_6388'>nor lie by no lady, wife nor maid; and when he came into the city, he</a>
<a id='line_6389'>passed to the castle, and comforted them that were in sorrow, and</a>
<a id='line_6390'>ordained there a captain, a knight of his own country.</a>
<a id='line_6391'></a>
<a id='line_6392'>And when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent to King</a>
<a id='line_6393'>Arthur great sums of money, and besought him as their lord to have pity</a>
<a id='line_6394'>on them, promising to be his subjects for ever, and yield to him homage</a>
<a id='line_6395'>and fealty for the lands of Pleasance and Pavia, Petersaint, and the</a>
<a id='line_6396'>Port of Tremble, and to give him yearly a million of gold all his</a>
<a id='line_6397'>lifetime. Then he rideth into Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles,</a>
<a id='line_6398'>and wasted all in his way that to him will not obey, and so to Spolute</a>
<a id='line_6399'>and Viterbe, and from thence he rode into the Vale of Vicecount among</a>
<a id='line_6400'>the vines. And from thence he sent to the senators, to wit whether they</a>
<a id='line_6401'>would know him for their lord. But soon after on a Saturday came unto</a>
<a id='line_6402'>King Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest</a>
<a id='line_6403'>cardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of peace, and</a>
<a id='line_6404'>proferred him full large, and besought him as governor to give licence</a>
<a id='line_6405'>for six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him</a>
<a id='line_6406'>emperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate. I assent, said</a>
<a id='line_6407'>the king, like as ye have devised, and at Christmas there to be</a>
<a id='line_6408'>crowned, and to hold my Round Table with my knights as me liketh. And</a>
<a id='line_6409'>then the senators made ready for his enthronization. And at the day</a>
<a id='line_6410'>appointed, as the romance telleth, he came into Rome, and was crowned</a>
<a id='line_6411'>emperor by the pope’s hand, with all the royalty that could be made,</a>
<a id='line_6412'>and sojourned there a time, and established all his lands from Rome</a>
<a id='line_6413'>into France, and gave lands and realms unto his servants and knights,</a>
<a id='line_6414'>to everych after his desert, in such wise that none complained, rich</a>
<a id='line_6415'>nor poor. And he gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine; and he</a>
<a id='line_6416'>thanked him, and said he would serve him the days of his life; and</a>
<a id='line_6417'>after made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.</a>
<a id='line_6418'></a>
<a id='line_6419'>Then after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_6420'>said: Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest achieved,</a>
<a id='line_6421'>in so much that we know none so great nor mighty that dare make war</a>
<a id='line_6422'>against you: wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give us</a>
<a id='line_6423'>licence to go home to our wives, from whom we have been long, and to</a>
<a id='line_6424'>rest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship. Then</a>
<a id='line_6425'>said the king, Ye say truth, and for to tempt God it is no wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_6426'>therefore make you ready and return we into England. Then there was</a>
<a id='line_6427'>trussing of harness and baggage and great carriage. And after licence</a>
<a id='line_6428'>given, he returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should</a>
<a id='line_6429'>not rob nor take victual, nor other thing by the way but that he should</a>
<a id='line_6430'>pay therefore. And thus he came over the sea and landed at Sandwich,</a>
<a id='line_6431'>against whom Queen Guenever his wife came and met him, and he was nobly</a>
<a id='line_6432'>received of all his commons in every city and burgh, and great gifts</a>
<a id='line_6433'>presented to him at his home-coming to welcome him with.</a>
<a id='line_6434'></a>
<a id='line_6435'>Thus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur had against</a>
<a id='line_6436'>Lucius the Emperor of Rome, and here followeth the sixth book, which is</a>
<a id='line_6437'>of Sir Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_6438'></a>
<a id='line_6439'></a>
<a id='line_6440'></a>
<a id='line_6441'>BOOK VI.</a>
<a id='line_6442'></a>
<a id='line_6443'></a>
<a id='line_6444'></a>
<a id='line_6445'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court,</a>
<a id='line_6446'>and how Sir Lionel left him sleeping and was taken.</a>
<a id='line_6447'></a>
<a id='line_6448'>Soon after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then all</a>
<a id='line_6449'>the knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and made many</a>
<a id='line_6450'>jousts and tournaments, and some there were that were but knights,</a>
<a id='line_6451'>which increased so in arms and worship that they passed all their</a>
<a id='line_6452'>fellows in prowess and noble deeds, and that was well proved on many;</a>
<a id='line_6453'>but in especial it was proved on Sir Launcelot du Lake, for in all</a>
<a id='line_6454'>tournaments and jousts and deeds of arms, both for life and death, he</a>
<a id='line_6455'>passed all other knights, and at no time he was never overcome but if</a>
<a id='line_6456'>it were by treason or enchantment; so Sir Launcelot increased so</a>
<a id='line_6457'>marvellously in worship, and in honour, therefore is he the first</a>
<a id='line_6458'>knight that the French book maketh mention of after King Arthur came</a>
<a id='line_6459'>from Rome. Wherefore Queen Guenever had him in great favour above all</a>
<a id='line_6460'>other knights, and in certain he loved the queen again above all other</a>
<a id='line_6461'>ladies and damosels of his life, and for her he did many deeds of arms,</a>
<a id='line_6462'>and saved her from the fire through his noble chivalry.</a>
<a id='line_6463'></a>
<a id='line_6464'>Thus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game. And then he</a>
<a id='line_6465'>thought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then he bade</a>
<a id='line_6466'>his nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him ready; for we two will seek</a>
<a id='line_6467'>adventures. So they mounted on their horses, armed at all rights, and</a>
<a id='line_6468'>rode into a deep forest and so into a deep plain. And then the weather</a>
<a id='line_6469'>was hot about noon, and Sir Launcelot had great lust to sleep. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6470'>Lionel espied a great apple-tree that stood by an hedge, and said,</a>
<a id='line_6471'>Brother, yonder is a fair shadow, there may we rest us [and] our</a>
<a id='line_6472'>horses. It is well said, fair brother, said Sir Launcelot, for this</a>
<a id='line_6473'>eight year I was not so sleepy as I am now; and so they there alighted</a>
<a id='line_6474'>and tied their horses unto sundry trees, and so Sir Launcelot laid him</a>
<a id='line_6475'>down under an appletree, and his helm he laid under his head. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_6476'>Lionel waked while he slept. So Sir Launcelot was asleep passing fast.</a>
<a id='line_6477'></a>
<a id='line_6478'>And in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast fleeing</a>
<a id='line_6479'>as ever they might ride. And there followed them three but one knight.</a>
<a id='line_6480'>And when Sir Lionel saw him, him thought he saw never so great a</a>
<a id='line_6481'>knight, nor so well faring a man, neither so well apparelled unto all</a>
<a id='line_6482'>rights. So within a while this strong knight had overtaken one of these</a>
<a id='line_6483'>knights, and there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still.</a>
<a id='line_6484'>And then he rode unto the second knight, and smote him so that man and</a>
<a id='line_6485'>horse fell down. And then straight to the third knight he rode, and</a>
<a id='line_6486'>smote him behind his horse’s arse a spear length. And then he alighted</a>
<a id='line_6487'>down and reined his horse on the bridle, and bound all the three</a>
<a id='line_6488'>knights fast with the reins of their own bridles. When Sir Lionel saw</a>
<a id='line_6489'>him do thus, he thought to assay him, and made him ready, and stilly</a>
<a id='line_6490'>and privily he took his horse, and thought not for to awake Sir</a>
<a id='line_6491'>Launcelot. And when he was mounted upon his horse, he overtook this</a>
<a id='line_6492'>strong knight, and bade him turn, and the other smote Sir Lionel so</a>
<a id='line_6493'>hard that horse and man he bare to the earth, and so he alighted down</a>
<a id='line_6494'>and bound him fast, and threw him overthwart his own horse, and so he</a>
<a id='line_6495'>served them all four, and rode with them away to his own castle. And</a>
<a id='line_6496'>when he came there he gart unarm them, and beat them with thorns all</a>
<a id='line_6497'>naked, and after put them in a deep prison where were many more</a>
<a id='line_6498'>knights, that made great dolour.</a>
<a id='line_6499'></a>
<a id='line_6500'></a>
<a id='line_6501'></a>
<a id='line_6502'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Ector followed for to seek Sir Launcelot, and how</a>
<a id='line_6503'>he was taken by Sir Turquine.</a>
<a id='line_6504'></a>
<a id='line_6505'>When Sir Ector de Maris wist that Sir Launcelot was passed out of the</a>
<a id='line_6506'>court to seek adventures, he was wroth with himself, and made him ready</a>
<a id='line_6507'>to seek Sir Launcelot, and as he had ridden long in a great forest he</a>
<a id='line_6508'>met with a man was like a forester. Fair fellow, said Sir Ector,</a>
<a id='line_6509'>knowest thou in this country any adventures that be here nigh hand?</a>
<a id='line_6510'>Sir, said the forester, this country know I well, and hereby, within</a>
<a id='line_6511'>this mile, is a strong manor, and well dyked, and by that manor, on the</a>
<a id='line_6512'>left hand, there is a fair ford for horses to drink of, and over that</a>
<a id='line_6513'>ford there groweth a fair tree, and thereon hang many fair shields that</a>
<a id='line_6514'>wielded sometime good knights, and at the hole of the tree hangeth a</a>
<a id='line_6515'>basin of copper and latten, and strike upon that basin with the butt of</a>
<a id='line_6516'>thy spear thrice, and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings, and else</a>
<a id='line_6517'>hast thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever knight that</a>
<a id='line_6518'>passed through this forest. Gramercy, said Sir Ector, and departed and</a>
<a id='line_6519'>came to the tree, and saw many fair shields. And among them he saw his</a>
<a id='line_6520'>brother’s shield, Sir Lionel, and many more that he knew that were his</a>
<a id='line_6521'>fellows of the Round Table, the which grieved his heart, and promised</a>
<a id='line_6522'>to revenge his brother.</a>
<a id='line_6523'></a>
<a id='line_6524'>Then anon Sir Ector beat on the basin as he were wood, and then he gave</a>
<a id='line_6525'>his horse drink at the ford, and there came a knight behind him and</a>
<a id='line_6526'>bade him come out of the water and make him ready; and Sir Ector anon</a>
<a id='line_6527'>turned him shortly, and in feuter cast his spear, and smote the other</a>
<a id='line_6528'>knight a great buffet that his horse turned twice about. This was well</a>
<a id='line_6529'>done, said the strong knight, and knightly thou hast stricken me; and</a>
<a id='line_6530'>therewith he rushed his horse on Sir Ector, and cleight him under his</a>
<a id='line_6531'>right arm, and bare him clean out of the saddle, and rode with him away</a>
<a id='line_6532'>into his own hall, and threw him down in midst of the floor. The name</a>
<a id='line_6533'>of this knight was Sir Turquine. Then he said unto Sir Ector, For thou</a>
<a id='line_6534'>hast done this day more unto me than any knight did these twelve years,</a>
<a id='line_6535'>now will I grant thee thy life, so thou wilt be sworn to be my prisoner</a>
<a id='line_6536'>all thy life days. Nay, said Sir Ector, that will I never promise thee,</a>
<a id='line_6537'>but that I will do mine advantage. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6538'>Turquine. And then he gart to unarm him, and beat him with thorns all</a>
<a id='line_6539'>naked, and sithen put him down in a deep dungeon, where he knew many of</a>
<a id='line_6540'>his fellows. But when Sir Ector saw Sir Lionel, then made he great</a>
<a id='line_6541'>sorrow. Alas, brother, said Sir Ector, where is my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_6542'>Launcelot? Fair brother, I left him asleep when that I from him yode,</a>
<a id='line_6543'>under an apple-tree, and what is become of him I cannot tell you. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_6544'>said the knights, but Sir Launcelot help us we may never be delivered,</a>
<a id='line_6545'>for we know now no knight that is able to match our master Turquine.</a>
<a id='line_6546'></a>
<a id='line_6547'></a>
<a id='line_6548'></a>
<a id='line_6549'>CHAPTER III. How four queens found Launcelot sleeping, and how by</a>
<a id='line_6550'>enchantment he was taken and led into a castle.</a>
<a id='line_6551'></a>
<a id='line_6552'>Now leave we these knights prisoners, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6553'>Lake that lieth under the apple-tree sleeping. Even about the noon</a>
<a id='line_6554'>there came by him four queens of great estate; and, for the heat should</a>
<a id='line_6555'>not annoy them, there rode four knights about them, and bare a cloth of</a>
<a id='line_6556'>green silk on four spears, betwixt them and the sun, and the queens</a>
<a id='line_6557'>rode on four white mules. Thus as they rode they heard by them a great</a>
<a id='line_6558'>horse grimly neigh, then were they ware of a sleeping knight, that lay</a>
<a id='line_6559'>all armed under an apple-tree; anon as these queens looked on his face,</a>
<a id='line_6560'>they knew it was Sir Launcelot. Then they began for to strive for that</a>
<a id='line_6561'>knight, everych one said they would have him to her love. We shall not</a>
<a id='line_6562'>strive, said Morgan le Fay, that was King Arthur’s sister, I shall put</a>
<a id='line_6563'>an enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in six hours, and then</a>
<a id='line_6564'>I will lead him away unto my castle, and when he is surely within my</a>
<a id='line_6565'>hold, I shall take the enchantment from him, and then let him choose</a>
<a id='line_6566'>which of us he will have unto paramour.</a>
<a id='line_6567'></a>
<a id='line_6568'>So this enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot, and then they laid him</a>
<a id='line_6569'>upon his shield, and bare him so on horseback betwixt two knights, and</a>
<a id='line_6570'>brought him unto the castle Chariot, and there they laid him in a</a>
<a id='line_6571'>chamber cold, and at night they sent unto him a fair damosel with his</a>
<a id='line_6572'>supper ready dight. By that the enchantment was past, and when she came</a>
<a id='line_6573'>she saluted him, and asked him what cheer. I cannot say, fair damosel,</a>
<a id='line_6574'>said Sir Launcelot, for I wot not how I came into this castle but it be</a>
<a id='line_6575'>by an enchantment. Sir, said she, ye must make good cheer, and if ye be</a>
<a id='line_6576'>such a knight as it is said ye be, I shall tell you more to-morn by</a>
<a id='line_6577'>prime of the day. Gramercy, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of your</a>
<a id='line_6578'>good will I require you. And so she departed. And there he lay all that</a>
<a id='line_6579'>night without comfort of anybody. And on the morn early came these four</a>
<a id='line_6580'>queens, passingly well beseen, all they bidding him good morn, and he</a>
<a id='line_6581'>them again.</a>
<a id='line_6582'></a>
<a id='line_6583'>Sir knight, the four queens said, thou must understand thou art our</a>
<a id='line_6584'>prisoner, and we here know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6585'>Lake, King Ban’s son, and because we understand your worthiness, that</a>
<a id='line_6586'>thou art the noblest knight living, and as we know well there can no</a>
<a id='line_6587'>lady have thy love but one, and that is Queen Guenever, and now thou</a>
<a id='line_6588'>shalt lose her for ever, and she thee, and therefore thee behoveth now</a>
<a id='line_6589'>to choose one of us four. I am the Queen Morgan le Fay, queen of the</a>
<a id='line_6590'>land of Gore, and here is the queen of Northgalis, and the queen of</a>
<a id='line_6591'>Eastland, and the queen of the Out Isles; now choose one of us which</a>
<a id='line_6592'>thou wilt have to thy paramour, for thou mayest not choose or else in</a>
<a id='line_6593'>this prison to die. This is an hard case, said Sir Launcelot, that</a>
<a id='line_6594'>either I must die or else choose one of you, yet had I liefer to die in</a>
<a id='line_6595'>this prison with worship, than to have one of you to my paramour maugre</a>
<a id='line_6596'>my head. And therefore ye be answered, I will none of you, for ye be</a>
<a id='line_6597'>false enchantresses, and as for my lady, Dame Guenever, were I at my</a>
<a id='line_6598'>liberty as I was, I would prove it on you or on yours, that she is the</a>
<a id='line_6599'>truest lady unto her lord living. Well, said the queens, is this your</a>
<a id='line_6600'>answer, that ye will refuse us. Yea, on my life, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6601'>refused ye be of me. So they departed and left him there alone that</a>
<a id='line_6602'>made great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_6603'></a>
<a id='line_6604'></a>
<a id='line_6605'></a>
<a id='line_6606'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was delivered by the mean of a damosel.</a>
<a id='line_6607'></a>
<a id='line_6608'>Right so at the noon came the damosel unto him with his dinner, and</a>
<a id='line_6609'>asked him what cheer. Truly, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, in my</a>
<a id='line_6610'>life days never so ill. Sir, she said, that me repenteth, but an ye</a>
<a id='line_6611'>will be ruled by me, I shall help you out of this distress, and ye</a>
<a id='line_6612'>shall have no shame nor villainy, so that ye hold me a promise. Fair</a>
<a id='line_6613'>damosel, I will grant you, and sore I am of these queen-sorceresses</a>
<a id='line_6614'>afeard, for they have destroyed many a good knight. Sir, said she, that</a>
<a id='line_6615'>is sooth, and for the renown and bounty that they hear of you they</a>
<a id='line_6616'>would have your love, and Sir, they say, your name is Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6617'>Lake, the flower of knights, and they be passing wroth with you that ye</a>
<a id='line_6618'>have refused them. But Sir, an ye would promise me to help my father on</a>
<a id='line_6619'>Tuesday next coming, that hath made a tournament betwixt him and the</a>
<a id='line_6620'>King of Northgalis—for the last Tuesday past my father lost the field</a>
<a id='line_6621'>through three knights of Arthur’s court—an ye will be there on Tuesday</a>
<a id='line_6622'>next coming, and help my father, to-morn or prime, by the grace of God,</a>
<a id='line_6623'>I shall deliver you clean. Fair maiden, said Sir Launcelot, tell me</a>
<a id='line_6624'>what is your father’s name, and then shall I give you an answer. Sir</a>
<a id='line_6625'>knight, she said, my father is King Bagdemagus, that was foul rebuked</a>
<a id='line_6626'>at the last tournament. I know your father well, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6627'>for a noble king and a good knight, and by the faith of my body, ye</a>
<a id='line_6628'>shall have my body ready to do your father and you service at that day.</a>
<a id='line_6629'>Sir, she said, gramercy, and to-morn await ye be ready betimes and I</a>
<a id='line_6630'>shall be she that shall deliver you and take you your armour and your</a>
<a id='line_6631'>horse, shield and spear, and hereby within this ten mile, is an abbey</a>
<a id='line_6632'>of white monks, there I pray you that ye me abide, and thither shall I</a>
<a id='line_6633'>bring my father unto you. All this shall be done, said Sir Launcelot as</a>
<a id='line_6634'>I am true knight.</a>
<a id='line_6635'></a>
<a id='line_6636'>And so she departed, and came on the morn early, and found him ready;</a>
<a id='line_6637'>then she brought him out of twelve locks, and brought him unto his</a>
<a id='line_6638'>armour, and when he was clean armed, she brought him until his own</a>
<a id='line_6639'>horse, and lightly he saddled him and took a great spear in his hand</a>
<a id='line_6640'>and so rode forth, and said, Fair damosel, I shall not fail you, by the</a>
<a id='line_6641'>grace of God. And so he rode into a great forest all that day, and</a>
<a id='line_6642'>never could find no highway and so the night fell on him, and then was</a>
<a id='line_6643'>he ware in a slade, of a pavilion of red sendal. By my faith, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6644'>Launcelot, in that pavilion will I lodge all this night, and so there</a>
<a id='line_6645'>he alighted down, and tied his horse to the pavilion, and there he</a>
<a id='line_6646'>unarmed him, and there he found a bed, and laid him therein and fell</a>
<a id='line_6647'>asleep sadly.</a>
<a id='line_6648'></a>
<a id='line_6649'></a>
<a id='line_6650'></a>
<a id='line_6651'>CHAPTER V. How a knight found Sir Launcelot lying in his leman’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_6652'>and how Sir Launcelot fought with the knight.</a>
<a id='line_6653'></a>
<a id='line_6654'>Then within an hour there came the knight to whom the pavilion ought,</a>
<a id='line_6655'>and he weened that his leman had lain in that bed, and so he laid him</a>
<a id='line_6656'>down beside Sir Launcelot, and took him in his arms and began to kiss</a>
<a id='line_6657'>him. And when Sir Launcelot felt a rough beard kissing him, he started</a>
<a id='line_6658'>out of the bed lightly, and the other knight after him, and either of</a>
<a id='line_6659'>them gat their swords in their hands, and out at the pavilion door went</a>
<a id='line_6660'>the knight of the pavilion, and Sir Launcelot followed him, and there</a>
<a id='line_6661'>by a little slake Sir Launcelot wounded him sore, nigh unto the death.</a>
<a id='line_6662'>And then he yielded him unto Sir Launcelot, and so he granted him, so</a>
<a id='line_6663'>that he would tell him why he came into the bed. Sir, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_6664'>the pavilion is mine own, and there this night I had assigned my lady</a>
<a id='line_6665'>to have slept with me, and now I am likely to die of this wound. That</a>
<a id='line_6666'>me repenteth, said Launcelot, of your hurt, but I was adread of</a>
<a id='line_6667'>treason, for I was late beguiled, and therefore come on your way into</a>
<a id='line_6668'>your pavilion and take your rest, and as I suppose I shall staunch your</a>
<a id='line_6669'>blood. And so they went both into the pavilion, and anon Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6670'>staunched his blood.</a>
<a id='line_6671'></a>
<a id='line_6672'>Therewithal came the knight’s lady, that was a passing fair lady, and</a>
<a id='line_6673'>when she espied that her lord Belleus was sore wounded, she cried out</a>
<a id='line_6674'>on Sir Launcelot, and made great dole out of measure. Peace, my lady</a>
<a id='line_6675'>and my love, said Belleus, for this knight is a good man, and a knight</a>
<a id='line_6676'>adventurous, and there he told her all the cause how he was wounded;</a>
<a id='line_6677'>And when that I yielded me unto him, he left me goodly and hath</a>
<a id='line_6678'>staunched my blood. Sir, said the lady, I require thee tell me what</a>
<a id='line_6679'>knight ye be, and what is your name? Fair lady, he said, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_6680'>Launcelot du Lake. So me thought ever by your speech, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_6681'>for I have seen you oft or this, and I know you better than ye ween.</a>
<a id='line_6682'>But now an ye would promise me of your courtesy, for the harms that ye</a>
<a id='line_6683'>have done to me and my Lord Belleus, that when he cometh unto Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_6684'>court for to cause him to be made knight of the Round Table, for he is</a>
<a id='line_6685'>a passing good man of arms, and a mighty lord of lands of many out</a>
<a id='line_6686'>isles.</a>
<a id='line_6687'></a>
<a id='line_6688'>Fair lady, said Sir Launcelot, let him come unto the court the next</a>
<a id='line_6689'>high feast, and look that ye come with him, and I shall do my power, an</a>
<a id='line_6690'>ye prove you doughty of your hands, that ye shall have your desire. So</a>
<a id='line_6691'>thus within a while, as they thus talked, the night passed, and the day</a>
<a id='line_6692'>shone, and then Sir Launcelot armed him, and took his horse, and they</a>
<a id='line_6693'>taught him to the Abbey, and thither he rode within the space of two</a>
<a id='line_6694'>hours.</a>

<a id='line_6699'>daughter, and how he made his complaint to her father.</a>
<a id='line_6700'></a>
<a id='line_6701'>And soon as Sir Launcelot came within the abbey yard, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_6702'>King Bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement. And she then</a>
<a id='line_6703'>arose and yede unto a window, and there she saw Sir Launcelot, and anon</a>
<a id='line_6704'>she made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a</a>
<a id='line_6705'>stable, and himself was led into a fair chamber, and unarmed him, and</a>
<a id='line_6706'>the lady sent him a long gown, and anon she came herself. And then she</a>
<a id='line_6707'>made Launcelot passing good cheer, and she said he was the knight in</a>
<a id='line_6708'>the world was most welcome to her. Then in all haste she sent for her</a>
<a id='line_6709'>father Bagdemagus that was within twelve mile of that Abbey, and afore</a>
<a id='line_6710'>even he came, with a fair fellowship of knights with him. And when the</a>
<a id='line_6711'>king was alighted off his horse he yode straight unto Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_6712'>chamber and there he found his daughter, and then the king embraced Sir</a>
<a id='line_6713'>Launcelot in his arms, and either made other good cheer.</a>
<a id='line_6714'></a>
<a id='line_6715'>Anon Sir Launcelot made his complaint unto the king how he was</a>
<a id='line_6716'>betrayed, and how his brother Sir Lionel was departed from him he wist</a>
<a id='line_6717'>not where, and how his daughter had delivered him out of prison;</a>
<a id='line_6718'>Therefore while I live I shall do her service and all her kindred. Then</a>
<a id='line_6719'>am I sure of your help, said the king, on Tuesday next coming. Yea,</a>
<a id='line_6720'>sir, said Sir Launcelot, I shall not fail you, for so I have promised</a>
<a id='line_6721'>my lady your daughter. But, sir, what knights be they of my lord</a>
<a id='line_6722'>Arthur’s that were with the King of Northgalis? And the king said it</a>
<a id='line_6723'>was Sir Mador de la Porte, and Sir Mordred and Sir Gahalantine that all</a>
<a id='line_6724'>for-fared my knights, for against them three I nor my knights might</a>
<a id='line_6725'>bear no strength. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, as I hear say that the</a>
<a id='line_6726'>tournament shall be here within this three mile of this abbey, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_6727'>send unto me three knights of yours, such as ye trust, and look that</a>
<a id='line_6728'>the three knights have all white shields, and I also, and no painture</a>
<a id='line_6729'>on the shields, and we four will come out of a little wood in midst of</a>
<a id='line_6730'>both parties, and we shall fall in the front of our enemies and grieve</a>
<a id='line_6731'>them that we may; and thus shall I not be known what knight I am.</a>
<a id='line_6732'></a>
<a id='line_6733'>So they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and so</a>
<a id='line_6734'>the king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the</a>
<a id='line_6735'>four white shields. And on the Tuesday they lodged them in a little</a>
<a id='line_6736'>leaved wood beside there the tournament should be. And there were</a>
<a id='line_6737'>scaffolds and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to give the</a>
<a id='line_6738'>prize. Then came into the field the King of Northgalis with eight score</a>
<a id='line_6739'>helms. And then the three knights of Arthur’s stood by themselves. Then</a>
<a id='line_6740'>came into the field King Bagdemagus with four score of helms. And then</a>
<a id='line_6741'>they feutred their spears, and came together with a great dash, and</a>
<a id='line_6742'>there were slain of knights at the first recounter twelve of King</a>
<a id='line_6743'>Bagdemagus’ party, and six of the King of Northgalis’ party, and King</a>
<a id='line_6744'>Bagdemagus’ party was far set aback.</a>

<a id='line_6748'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him in a tournament, and how he</a>
<a id='line_6749'>met with Sir Turquine leading Sir Gaheris.</a>
<a id='line_6750'></a>
<a id='line_6751'>With that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he thrust in with his spear</a>
<a id='line_6752'>in the thickest of the press, and there he smote down with one spear</a>
<a id='line_6753'>five knights, and of four of them he brake their backs. And in that</a>
<a id='line_6754'>throng he smote down the King of Northgalis, and brake his thigh in</a>
<a id='line_6755'>that fall. All this doing of Sir Launcelot saw the three knights of</a>
<a id='line_6756'>Arthur’s. Yonder is a shrewd guest, said Sir Mador de la Porte,</a>
<a id='line_6757'>therefore have here once at him. So they encountered, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6758'>bare him down horse and man, so that his shoulder went out of lith. Now</a>
<a id='line_6759'>befalleth it to me to joust, said Mordred, for Sir Mador hath a sore</a>
<a id='line_6760'>fall. Sir Launcelot was ware of him, and gat a great spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_6761'>and met him, and Sir Mordred brake a spear upon him, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6762'>gave him such a buffet that the arson of his saddle brake, and so he</a>
<a id='line_6763'>flew over his horse’s tail, that his helm butted into the earth a foot</a>
<a id='line_6764'>and more, that nigh his neck was broken, and there he lay long in a</a>
<a id='line_6765'>swoon.</a>
<a id='line_6766'></a>
<a id='line_6767'>Then came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot against</a>
<a id='line_6768'>him, with all their strength that they might drive, that both their</a>
<a id='line_6769'>spears to-brast even to their hands, and then they flang out with their</a>
<a id='line_6770'>swords and gave many a grim stroke. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of</a>
<a id='line_6771'>measure, and then he smote Sir Gahalantine on the helm that his nose</a>
<a id='line_6772'>brast out on blood, and ears and mouth both, and therewith his head</a>
<a id='line_6773'>hung low. And therewith his horse ran away with him, and he fell down</a>
<a id='line_6774'>to the earth. Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his</a>
<a id='line_6775'>hand, and or ever that great spear brake, he bare down to the earth</a>
<a id='line_6776'>sixteen knights, some horse and man, and some the man and not the</a>
<a id='line_6777'>horse, and there was none but that he hit surely, he bare none arms</a>
<a id='line_6778'>that day. And then he gat another great spear, and smote down twelve</a>
<a id='line_6779'>knights, and the most part of them never throve after. And then the</a>
<a id='line_6780'>knights of the King of Northgalis would joust no more. And there the</a>
<a id='line_6781'>gree was given to King Bagdemagus.</a>
<a id='line_6782'></a>
<a id='line_6783'>So either party departed unto his own place, and Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_6784'>forth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle, and there he had passing</a>
<a id='line_6785'>good cheer both with the king and with his daughter, and they proffered</a>
<a id='line_6786'>him great gifts. And on the morn he took his leave, and told the king</a>
<a id='line_6787'>that he would go and seek his brother Sir Lionel, that went from him</a>
<a id='line_6788'>when that he slept, so he took his horse, and betaught them all to God.</a>
<a id='line_6789'>And there he said unto the king’s daughter, If ye have need any time of</a>
<a id='line_6790'>my service I pray you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you</a>
<a id='line_6791'>as I am true knight. And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he</a>
<a id='line_6792'>came into the same forest there he was taken sleeping. And in the midst</a>
<a id='line_6793'>of a highway he met a damosel riding on a white palfrey, and there</a>
<a id='line_6794'>either saluted other. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, know ye in this</a>
<a id='line_6795'>country any adventures? Sir knight, said that damosel, here are</a>
<a id='line_6796'>adventures near hand, an thou durst prove them. Why should I not prove</a>
<a id='line_6797'>adventures? said Sir Launcelot for that cause come I hither. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_6798'>she, thou seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou dare meet with</a>
<a id='line_6799'>a good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best knight, and the</a>
<a id='line_6800'>mightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me what is thy name,</a>
<a id='line_6801'>and what knight thou art. Damosel, as for to tell thee my name I take</a>
<a id='line_6802'>no great force; truly my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Sir, thou</a>
<a id='line_6803'>beseemest well, here be adventures by that fall for thee, for hereby</a>
<a id='line_6804'>dwelleth a knight that will not be overmatched for no man I know but ye</a>
<a id='line_6805'>overmatch him, and his name is Sir Turquine. And, as I understand, he</a>
<a id='line_6806'>hath in his prison, of Arthur’s court, good knights three score and</a>
<a id='line_6807'>four, that he hath won with his own hands. But when ye have done that</a>
<a id='line_6808'>journey ye shall promise me as ye are a true knight for to go with me,</a>
<a id='line_6809'>and to help me and other damosels that are distressed daily with a</a>
<a id='line_6810'>false knight. All your intent, damosel, and desire I will fulfil, so ye</a>
<a id='line_6811'>will bring me unto this knight. Now, fair knight, come on your way; and</a>
<a id='line_6812'>so she brought him unto the ford and the tree where hung the basin.</a>
<a id='line_6813'></a>
<a id='line_6814'>So Sir Launcelot let his horse drink, and then he beat on the basin</a>
<a id='line_6815'>with the butt of his spear so hard with all his might till the bottom</a>
<a id='line_6816'>fell out, and long he did so, but he saw nothing. Then he rode endlong</a>
<a id='line_6817'>the gates of that manor nigh half-an-hour. And then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_6818'>great knight that drove an horse afore him, and overthwart the horse</a>
<a id='line_6819'>there lay an armed knight bound. And ever as they came near and near,</a>
<a id='line_6820'>Sir Launcelot thought he should know him. Then Sir Launcelot was ware</a>
<a id='line_6821'>that it was Sir Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, a knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_6822'>Round. Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I see yonder cometh a</a>
<a id='line_6823'>knight fast bounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he is unto</a>
<a id='line_6824'>Sir Gawaine. And at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave of</a>
<a id='line_6825'>God, to rescue that knight; but if his master sit better in the saddle</a>
<a id='line_6826'>I shall deliver all the prisoners that he hath out of danger, for I am</a>
<a id='line_6827'>sure he hath two brethren of mine prisoners with him. By that time that</a>
<a id='line_6828'>either had seen other, they gripped their spears unto them. Now, fair</a>
<a id='line_6829'>knight, said Sir Launcelot, put that wounded knight off the horse, and</a>
<a id='line_6830'>let him rest awhile, and let us two prove our strengths; for as it is</a>
<a id='line_6831'>informed me, thou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto</a>
<a id='line_6832'>knights of the Round Table, and therefore now defend thee. An thou be</a>
<a id='line_6833'>of the Table Round, said Turquine, I defy thee and all thy fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_6834'>That is overmuch said, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6835'></a>
<a id='line_6836'></a>
<a id='line_6837'></a>
<a id='line_6838'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquine fought together.</a>
<a id='line_6839'></a>
<a id='line_6840'>And then they put their spears in the rests, and came together with</a>
<a id='line_6841'>their horses as fast as they might run, and either smote other in midst</a>
<a id='line_6842'>of their shields, that both their horses’ backs brast under them, and</a>
<a id='line_6843'>the knights were both stonied. And as soon as they might avoid their</a>
<a id='line_6844'>horses, they took their shields afore them, and drew out their swords,</a>
<a id='line_6845'>and came together eagerly, and either gave other many strong strokes,</a>
<a id='line_6846'>for there might neither shields nor harness hold their strokes. And so</a>
<a id='line_6847'>within a while they had both grimly wounds, and bled passing</a>
<a id='line_6848'>grievously. Thus they fared two hours or more trasing and rasing either</a>
<a id='line_6849'>other, where they might hit any bare place.</a>
<a id='line_6850'></a>
<a id='line_6851'>Then at the last they were breathless both, and stood leaning on their</a>
<a id='line_6852'>swords. Now fellow, said Sir Turquine, hold thy hand a while, and tell</a>
<a id='line_6853'>me what I shall ask thee. Say on. Then Turquine said, Thou art the</a>
<a id='line_6854'>biggest man that ever I met withal, and the best breathed, and like one</a>
<a id='line_6855'>knight that I hate above all other knights; so be it that thou be not</a>
<a id='line_6856'>he I will lightly accord with thee, and for thy love I will deliver all</a>
<a id='line_6857'>the prisoners that I have, that is three score and four, so thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_6858'>tell me thy name. And thou and I we will be fellows together, and never</a>
<a id='line_6859'>to fail thee while that I live. It is well said, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6860'>but sithen it is so that I may have thy friendship, what knight is he</a>
<a id='line_6861'>that thou so hatest above all other? Faithfully, said Sir Turquine, his</a>
<a id='line_6862'>name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, for he slew my brother, Sir Carados, at</a>
<a id='line_6863'>the dolorous tower, that was one of the best knights alive; and</a>
<a id='line_6864'>therefore him I except of all knights, for may I once meet with him,</a>
<a id='line_6865'>the one of us shall make an end of other, I make mine avow. And for Sir</a>
<a id='line_6866'>Launcelot’s sake I have slain an hundred good knights, and as many I</a>
<a id='line_6867'>have maimed all utterly that they might never after help themselves,</a>
<a id='line_6868'>and many have died in prison, and yet have I three score and four, and</a>
<a id='line_6869'>all shall be delivered so thou wilt tell me thy name, so be it that</a>
<a id='line_6870'>thou be not Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6871'></a>
<a id='line_6872'>Now, see I well, said Sir Launcelot, that such a man I might be, I</a>
<a id='line_6873'>might have peace, and such a man I might be, that there should be war</a>
<a id='line_6874'>mortal betwixt us. And now, sir knight, at thy request I will that thou</a>
<a id='line_6875'>wit and know that I am Launcelot du Lake, King Ban’s son of Benwick,</a>
<a id='line_6876'>and very knight of the Table Round. And now I defy thee, and do thy</a>
<a id='line_6877'>best. Ah, said Turquine, Launcelot, thou art unto me most welcome that</a>
<a id='line_6878'>ever was knight, for we shall never depart till the one of us be dead.</a>
<a id='line_6879'>Then they hurtled together as two wild bulls rushing and lashing with</a>
<a id='line_6880'>their shields and swords, that sometime they fell both over their</a>
<a id='line_6881'>noses. Thus they fought still two hours and more, and never would have</a>
<a id='line_6882'>rest, and Sir Turquine gave Sir Launcelot many wounds that all the</a>
<a id='line_6883'>ground thereas they fought was all bespeckled with blood.</a>

<a id='line_6887'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Turquine was slain, and how Sir Launcelot bade Sir</a>
<a id='line_6888'>Gaheris deliver all the prisoners.</a>
<a id='line_6889'></a>
<a id='line_6890'>Then at the last Sir Turquine waxed faint, and gave somewhat aback, and</a>
<a id='line_6891'>bare his shield low for weariness. That espied Sir Launcelot, and leapt</a>
<a id='line_6892'>upon him fiercely and gat him by the beaver of his helmet, and plucked</a>
<a id='line_6893'>him down on his knees, and anon he raced off his helm, and smote his</a>
<a id='line_6894'>neck in sunder. And when Sir Launcelot had done this, he yode unto the</a>
<a id='line_6895'>damosel and said, Damosel, I am ready to go with you where ye will have</a>
<a id='line_6896'>me, but I have no horse. Fair sir, said she, take this wounded knight’s</a>
<a id='line_6897'>horse and send him into this manor, and command him to deliver all the</a>
<a id='line_6898'>prisoners. So Sir Launcelot went unto Gaheris, and prayed him not to be</a>
<a id='line_6899'>aggrieved for to lend him his horse. Nay, fair lord, said Gaheris, I</a>
<a id='line_6900'>will that ye take my horse at your own commandment, for ye have both</a>
<a id='line_6901'>saved me and my horse, and this day I say ye are the best knight in the</a>
<a id='line_6902'>world, for ye have slain this day in my sight the mightiest man and the</a>
<a id='line_6903'>best knight except you that ever I saw, and, fair sir, said Gaheris, I</a>
<a id='line_6904'>pray you tell me your name. Sir, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, that</a>
<a id='line_6905'>ought to help you of right for King Arthur’s sake, and in especial for</a>
<a id='line_6906'>my lord Sir Gawaine’s sake, your own dear brother; and when that ye</a>
<a id='line_6907'>come within yonder manor, I am sure ye shall find there many knights of</a>
<a id='line_6908'>the Round Table, for I have seen many of their shields that I know on</a>
<a id='line_6909'>yonder tree. There is Kay’s shield, and Sir Brandel’s shield, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6910'>Marhaus’ shield, and Sir Galind’s shield, and Sir Brian de Listnois’</a>
<a id='line_6911'>shield, and Sir Aliduke’s shield, with many more that I am not now</a>
<a id='line_6912'>advised of, and also my two brethren’s shields, Sir Ector de Maris and</a>
<a id='line_6913'>Sir Lionel; wherefore I pray you greet them all from me, and say that I</a>
<a id='line_6914'>bid them take such stuff there as they find, and that in any wise my</a>
<a id='line_6915'>brethren go unto the court and abide me there till that I come, for by</a>
<a id='line_6916'>the feast of Pentecost I cast me to be there, for as at this time I</a>
<a id='line_6917'>must ride with this damosel for to save my promise.</a>
<a id='line_6918'></a>
<a id='line_6919'>And so he departed from Gaheris, and Gaheris yede in to the manor, and</a>
<a id='line_6920'>there he found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys. Anon withal Sir</a>
<a id='line_6921'>Gaheris threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him,</a>
<a id='line_6922'>and hastily he opened the prison door, and there he let out all the</a>
<a id='line_6923'>prisoners, and every man loosed other of their bonds. And when they saw</a>
<a id='line_6924'>Sir Gaheris, all they thanked him, for they weened that he was wounded.</a>
<a id='line_6925'>Not so, said Gaheris, it was Launcelot that slew him worshipfully with</a>
<a id='line_6926'>his own hands. I saw it with mine own eyes. And he greeteth you all</a>
<a id='line_6927'>well, and prayeth you to haste you to the court; and as unto Sir Lionel</a>
<a id='line_6928'>and Ector de Maris he prayeth you to abide him at the court. That shall</a>
<a id='line_6929'>we not do, says his brethren, we will find him an we may live. So shall</a>
<a id='line_6930'>I, said Sir Kay, find him or I come at the court, as I am true knight.</a>
<a id='line_6931'></a>
<a id='line_6932'>Then all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was, and</a>
<a id='line_6933'>then they armed them, and every knight found his own horse, and all</a>
<a id='line_6934'>that ever longed unto him. And when this was done, there came a</a>
<a id='line_6935'>forester with four horses laden with fat venison. Anon, Sir Kay said,</a>
<a id='line_6936'>Here is good meat for us for one meal, for we had not many a day no</a>
<a id='line_6937'>good repast. And so that venison was roasted, baken, and sodden, and so</a>
<a id='line_6938'>after supper some abode there all night, but Sir Lionel and Ector de</a>
<a id='line_6939'>Maris and Sir Kay rode after Sir Launcelot to find him if they might.</a>
<a id='line_6940'></a>
<a id='line_6941'></a>
<a id='line_6942'></a>
<a id='line_6943'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot rode with a damosel and slew a knight that</a>
<a id='line_6944'>distressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge.</a>
<a id='line_6945'></a>
<a id='line_6946'>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a fair</a>
<a id='line_6947'>highway. Sir, said the damosel, here by this way haunteth a knight that</a>
<a id='line_6948'>distressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the least he robbeth them</a>
<a id='line_6949'>or lieth by them. What, said Sir Launcelot, is he a thief and a knight</a>
<a id='line_6950'>and a ravisher of women? he doth shame unto the order of knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_6951'>and contrary unto his oath; it is pity that he liveth. But, fair</a>
<a id='line_6952'>damosel, ye shall ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in</a>
<a id='line_6953'>covert, and if that he trouble you or distress you I shall be your</a>
<a id='line_6954'>rescue and learn him to be ruled as a knight.</a>
<a id='line_6955'></a>
<a id='line_6956'>So the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace, and within a while</a>
<a id='line_6957'>came out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his page with</a>
<a id='line_6958'>him, and there he put the damosel from her horse, and then she cried.</a>
<a id='line_6959'>With that came Launcelot as fast as he might till he came to that</a>
<a id='line_6960'>knight, saying, O thou false knight and traitor unto knighthood, who</a>
<a id='line_6961'>did learn thee to distress ladies and gentlewomen? When the knight saw</a>
<a id='line_6962'>Sir Launcelot thus rebuking him he answered not, but drew his sword and</a>
<a id='line_6963'>rode unto Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw his spear from him,</a>
<a id='line_6964'>and drew out his sword, and struck him such a buffet on the helmet that</a>
<a id='line_6965'>he clave his head and neck unto the throat. Now hast thou thy payment</a>
<a id='line_6966'>that long thou hast deserved! That is truth, said the damosel, for like</a>
<a id='line_6967'>as Sir Turquine watched to destroy knights, so did this knight attend</a>
<a id='line_6968'>to destroy and distress ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen, and his name</a>
<a id='line_6969'>was Sir Peris de Forest Savage. Now, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, will</a>
<a id='line_6970'>ye any more service of me? Nay, sir, she said, at this time, but</a>
<a id='line_6971'>almighty Jesu preserve you wheresomever ye ride or go, for the curteist</a>
<a id='line_6972'>knight thou art, and meekest unto all ladies and gentlewomen, that now</a>
<a id='line_6973'>liveth. But one thing, sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a</a>
<a id='line_6974'>knight wifeless, that he will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for</a>
<a id='line_6975'>I could never hear say that ever ye loved any of no manner degree, and</a>
<a id='line_6976'>that is great pity; but it is noised that ye love Queen Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_6977'>that she hath ordained by enchantment that ye shall never love none</a>
<a id='line_6978'>other but her, nor none other damosel nor lady shall rejoice you;</a>
<a id='line_6979'>wherefore many in this land, of high estate and low, make great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_6980'></a>
<a id='line_6981'>Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I may not warn people to speak of me</a>
<a id='line_6982'>what it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think it not; for</a>
<a id='line_6983'>then I must couch with her, and leave arms and tournaments, battles,</a>
<a id='line_6984'>and adventures; and as for to say for to take my pleasaunce with</a>
<a id='line_6985'>paramours, that will I refuse in principal for dread of God; for</a>
<a id='line_6986'>knights that be adventurous or lecherous shall not be happy nor</a>
<a id='line_6987'>fortunate unto the wars, for other they shall be overcome with a</a>
<a id='line_6988'>simpler knight than they be themselves, other else they shall by unhap</a>
<a id='line_6989'>and their cursedness slay better men than they be themselves. And so</a>
<a id='line_6990'>who that useth paramours shall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy</a>
<a id='line_6991'>that is about them.</a>
<a id='line_6992'></a>
<a id='line_6993'>And so Sir Launcelot and she departed. And then he rode in a deep</a>
<a id='line_6994'>forest two days and more, and had strait lodging. So on the third day</a>
<a id='line_6995'>he rode over a long bridge, and there stert upon him suddenly a passing</a>
<a id='line_6996'>foul churl, and he smote his horse on the nose that he turned about,</a>
<a id='line_6997'>and asked him why he rode over that bridge without his licence. Why</a>
<a id='line_6998'>should I not ride this way? said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride beside.</a>
<a id='line_6999'>Thou shalt not choose, said the churl, and lashed at him with a great</a>
<a id='line_7000'>club shod with iron. Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and put the</a>
<a id='line_7001'>stroke aback, and clave his head unto the paps. At the end of the</a>
<a id='line_7002'>bridge was a fair village, and all the people, men and women, cried on</a>
<a id='line_7003'>Sir Launcelot, and said, A worse deed didst thou never for thyself, for</a>
<a id='line_7004'>thou hast slain the chief porter of our castle. Sir Launcelot let them</a>
<a id='line_7005'>say what they would, and straight he went into the castle; and when he</a>
<a id='line_7006'>came into the castle he alighted, and tied his horse to a ring on the</a>
<a id='line_7007'>wall and there he saw a fair green court, and thither he dressed him,</a>
<a id='line_7008'>for there him thought was a fair place to fight in. So he looked about,</a>
<a id='line_7009'>and saw much people in doors and windows that said, Fair knight, thou</a>
<a id='line_7010'>art unhappy.</a>
<a id='line_7011'></a>
<a id='line_7012'></a>
<a id='line_7013'></a>
<a id='line_7014'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free.</a>
<a id='line_7015'></a>
<a id='line_7016'>Anon withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed all save</a>
<a id='line_7017'>the heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put</a>
<a id='line_7018'>his shield afore him and put the stroke away of the one giant, and with</a>
<a id='line_7019'>his sword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow saw that, he ran</a>
<a id='line_7020'>away as he were wood, for fear of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7021'>after him with all his might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave</a>
<a id='line_7022'>him to the navel. Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came</a>
<a id='line_7023'>afore him three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him,</a>
<a id='line_7024'>and thanked God and him of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the</a>
<a id='line_7025'>most party of us have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we</a>
<a id='line_7026'>have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great</a>
<a id='line_7027'>gentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be</a>
<a id='line_7028'>born, for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this</a>
<a id='line_7029'>world, that will we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your</a>
<a id='line_7030'>name, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison. Fair</a>
<a id='line_7031'>damosel, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, sir, said they</a>
<a id='line_7032'>all, well mayest thou be he, for else save yourself, as we deemed,</a>
<a id='line_7033'>there might never knight have the better of these two giants; for many</a>
<a id='line_7034'>fair knights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have</a>
<a id='line_7035'>we wished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but you.</a>
<a id='line_7036'>Now may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how and who hath</a>
<a id='line_7037'>delivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in any of</a>
<a id='line_7038'>your marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what treasure</a>
<a id='line_7039'>that there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for your</a>
<a id='line_7040'>grievance, and the lord that is owner of this castle I would he</a>
<a id='line_7041'>received it as is right. Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle</a>
<a id='line_7042'>is Tintagil, and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine,</a>
<a id='line_7043'>and after wedded her Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_7044'>Sir Launcelot, I understand to whom this castle longeth; and so he</a>
<a id='line_7045'>departed from them, and betaught them unto God.</a>
<a id='line_7046'></a>
<a id='line_7047'>And then he mounted upon his horse, and rode into many strange and wild</a>
<a id='line_7048'>countries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he lodged.</a>
<a id='line_7049'>And at the last by fortune him happened, against a night, to come to a</a>
<a id='line_7050'>fair courtelage, and therein he found an old gentlewoman that lodged</a>
<a id='line_7051'>him with good will, and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.</a>
<a id='line_7052'>And when time was, his host brought him into a fair garret, over the</a>
<a id='line_7053'>gate, to his bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness</a>
<a id='line_7054'>by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell asleep. So, soon after, there</a>
<a id='line_7055'>came one on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste, and when</a>
<a id='line_7056'>Sir Launcelot heard this, he arose up and looked out at the window, and</a>
<a id='line_7057'>saw by the moonlight three knights came riding after that one man, and</a>
<a id='line_7058'>all three lashed on him at once with swords, and that one knight turned</a>
<a id='line_7059'>on them knightly again, and defended him. Truly, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7060'>yonder one knight shall I help, for it were shame for me to see three</a>
<a id='line_7061'>knights on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his death; and</a>
<a id='line_7062'>therewith he took his harness, and went out at a window by a sheet down</a>
<a id='line_7063'>to the four knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you</a>
<a id='line_7064'>knights unto me, and leave your fighting with that knight. And then</a>
<a id='line_7065'>they all three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there</a>
<a id='line_7066'>began great battle, for they alighted all three, and struck many great</a>
<a id='line_7067'>strokes at Sir Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_7068'>dressed him for to have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he, I will</a>
<a id='line_7069'>none of your help; therefore as ye will have my help, let me alone with</a>
<a id='line_7070'>them. Sir Kay, for the pleasure of the knight, suffered him for to do</a>
<a id='line_7071'>his will, and so stood aside. And then anon within six strokes, Sir</a>
<a id='line_7072'>Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_7073'></a>
<a id='line_7074'>And then they all three cried: Sir knight, we yield us unto you as a</a>
<a id='line_7075'>man of might makeless. As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take</a>
<a id='line_7076'>your yielding unto me. But so that ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the</a>
<a id='line_7077'>Seneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives, and else not. Fair</a>
<a id='line_7078'>knight, said they, that were we loath to do; for as for Sir Kay, we</a>
<a id='line_7079'>chased him hither, and had overcome him had not ye been, therefore to</a>
<a id='line_7080'>yield us unto him it were no reason. Well, as to that, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7081'>advise you well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an</a>
<a id='line_7082'>ye be yolden it shall be unto Sir Kay. Fair knight, then they said, in</a>
<a id='line_7083'>saving of our lives we will do as thou commandest us. Then shall ye,</a>
<a id='line_7084'>said Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming, go unto the court of</a>
<a id='line_7085'>King Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever, and put</a>
<a id='line_7086'>you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you</a>
<a id='line_7087'>thither to be her prisoners. Sir, they said, it shall be done by the</a>
<a id='line_7088'>faith of our bodies, an we be living, and there they swore every knight</a>
<a id='line_7089'>upon his sword. And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. And</a>
<a id='line_7090'>then Sir Launcelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword,</a>
<a id='line_7091'>and with that came his host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7092'>said his host, I weened ye had been in your bed. So I was, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7093'>Launcelot, but I rose and leapt out at my window for to help an old</a>
<a id='line_7094'>fellow of mine. And so when they came nigh the light, Sir Kay knew well</a>
<a id='line_7095'>that it was Sir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down and thanked</a>
<a id='line_7096'>him of all his kindness that he had holpen him twice from the death.</a>
<a id='line_7097'>Sir, he said, I have nothing done but that me ought for to do, and ye</a>
<a id='line_7098'>are welcome, and here shall ye repose you and take your rest.</a>
<a id='line_7099'></a>
<a id='line_7100'>So when Sir Kay was unarmed, he asked after meat; so there was meat</a>
<a id='line_7101'>fetched him, and he ate strongly. And when he had supped they went to</a>
<a id='line_7102'>their beds and were lodged together in one bed. On the morn Sir</a>
<a id='line_7103'>Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7104'>took Sir Kay’s armour and his shield, and armed him, and so he went to</a>
<a id='line_7105'>the stable, and took his horse, and took his leave of his host, and so</a>
<a id='line_7106'>he departed. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7107'>And then he espied that he had his armour and his horse. Now by my</a>
<a id='line_7108'>faith I know well that he will grieve some of the court of King Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_7109'>for on him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will</a>
<a id='line_7110'>beguile them. And because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall</a>
<a id='line_7111'>ride in peace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his</a>
<a id='line_7112'>host.</a>
<a id='line_7113'></a>
<a id='line_7114'></a>
<a id='line_7115'></a>
<a id='line_7116'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay’s harness, and</a>
<a id='line_7117'>how he smote down a knight.</a>
<a id='line_7118'></a>
<a id='line_7119'>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great forest,</a>
<a id='line_7120'>and at the last he came into a low country, full of fair rivers and</a>
<a id='line_7121'>meadows. And afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood</a>
<a id='line_7122'>thereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. And without the pavilions</a>
<a id='line_7123'>hung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great long spears</a>
<a id='line_7124'>stood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion’s door stood</a>
<a id='line_7125'>three fresh squires, and so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no</a>
<a id='line_7126'>word. When he was passed the three knights said them that it was the</a>
<a id='line_7127'>proud Kay; He weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is</a>
<a id='line_7128'>ofttime proved. By my faith, said one of the knights, his name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_7129'>Gaunter, I will ride after him and assay him for all his pride, and ye</a>
<a id='line_7130'>may behold how that I speed. So this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him,</a>
<a id='line_7131'>and hung his shield upon his shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse,</a>
<a id='line_7132'>and gat his spear in his hand, and walloped after Sir Launcelot. And</a>
<a id='line_7133'>when he came nigh him, he cried, Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for</a>
<a id='line_7134'>thou shalt not pass quit. So Sir Launcelot turned him, and either</a>
<a id='line_7135'>feutred their spears, and came together with all their mights, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7136'>Gaunter’s spear brake, but Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man.</a>
<a id='line_7137'>And when Sir Gaunter was at the earth his brethren said each one to</a>
<a id='line_7138'>other, Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he is bigger than he. I dare</a>
<a id='line_7139'>lay my head, said Sir Gilmere, yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and</a>
<a id='line_7140'>hath taken his horse and his harness. Whether it be so or no, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7141'>Raynold, the third brother, let us now go mount upon our horses and</a>
<a id='line_7142'>rescue our brother Sir Gaunter, upon pain of death. We all shall have</a>
<a id='line_7143'>work enough to match that knight, for ever meseemeth by his person it</a>
<a id='line_7144'>is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Pelleas, the good knight.</a>
<a id='line_7145'></a>
<a id='line_7146'>Then anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7147'>Gilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7148'>Launcelot smote him down that he lay in a swoon. Sir knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7149'>Raynold, thou art a strong man, and as I suppose thou hast slain my two</a>
<a id='line_7150'>brethren, for the which raseth my heart sore against thee, and if I</a>
<a id='line_7151'>might with my worship I would not have ado with you, but needs I must</a>
<a id='line_7152'>take part as they do, and therefore, knight, he said, keep thyself. And</a>
<a id='line_7153'>so they hurtled together with all their mights, and all to-shivered</a>
<a id='line_7154'>both their spears. And then they drew their swords and lashed together</a>
<a id='line_7155'>eagerly. Anon therewith arose Sir Gaunter, and came unto his brother</a>
<a id='line_7156'>Sir Gilmere, and bade him, Arise, and help we our brother Sir Raynold,</a>
<a id='line_7157'>that yonder marvellously matched yonder good knight. Therewithal, they</a>
<a id='line_7158'>leapt on their horses and hurtled unto Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7159'></a>
<a id='line_7160'>And when he saw them come he smote a sore stroke unto Sir Raynold, that</a>
<a id='line_7161'>he fell off his horse to the ground, and then he struck to the other</a>
<a id='line_7162'>two brethren, and at two strokes he struck them down to the earth. With</a>
<a id='line_7163'>that Sir Raynold began to start up with his head all bloody, and came</a>
<a id='line_7164'>straight unto Sir Launcelot. Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was not</a>
<a id='line_7165'>far from thee when thou wert made knight, Sir Raynold, and also I know</a>
<a id='line_7166'>thou art a good knight, and loath I were to slay thee. Gramercy, said</a>
<a id='line_7167'>Sir Raynold, as for your goodness; and I dare say as for me and my</a>
<a id='line_7168'>brethren, we will not be loath to yield us unto you, with that we knew</a>
<a id='line_7169'>your name, for well we know ye are not Sir Kay. As for that be it as it</a>
<a id='line_7170'>be may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever, and look that ye be</a>
<a id='line_7171'>with her on Whitsunday, and yield you unto her as prisoners, and say</a>
<a id='line_7172'>that Sir Kay sent you unto her. Then they swore it should be done, and</a>
<a id='line_7173'>so passed forth Sir Launcelot, and each one of the brethren holp other</a>
<a id='line_7174'>as well as they might.</a>

<a id='line_7179'>Round Table and overthrew them.</a>
<a id='line_7180'></a>
<a id='line_7181'>So Sir Launcelot rode into a deep forest, and thereby in a slade, he</a>
<a id='line_7182'>saw four knights hoving under an oak, and they were of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_7183'>one was Sir Sagramour le Desirous, and Ector de Maris, and Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_7184'>and Sir Uwaine. Anon as these four knights had espied Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7185'>they weened by his arms it had been Sir Kay. Now by my faith, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7186'>Sagramour, I will prove Sir Kay’s might, and gat his spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_7187'>and came toward Sir Launcelot. Therewith Sir Launcelot was ware and</a>
<a id='line_7188'>knew him well, and feutred his spear against him, and smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_7189'>Sagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the earth. Lo, my</a>
<a id='line_7190'>fellows, said he, yonder ye may see what a buffet he hath; that knight</a>
<a id='line_7191'>is much bigger than ever was Sir Kay. Now shall ye see what I may do to</a>
<a id='line_7192'>him. So Sir Ector gat his spear in his hand and walloped toward Sir</a>
<a id='line_7193'>Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him through the shield and shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_7194'>that man and horse went to the earth, and ever his spear held.</a>
<a id='line_7195'></a>
<a id='line_7196'>By my faith, said Sir Uwaine, yonder is a strong knight, and I am sure</a>
<a id='line_7197'>he hath slain Sir Kay; and I see by his great strength it will be hard</a>
<a id='line_7198'>to match him. And therewithal, Sir Uwaine gat his spear in his hand and</a>
<a id='line_7199'>rode toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot knew him well, and so he</a>
<a id='line_7200'>met him on the plain, and gave him such a buffet that he was astonied,</a>
<a id='line_7201'>that long he wist not where he was. Now see I well, said Sir Gawaine, I</a>
<a id='line_7202'>must encounter with that knight. Then he dressed his shield and gat a</a>
<a id='line_7203'>good spear in his hand, and Sir Launcelot knew him well; and then they</a>
<a id='line_7204'>let run their horses with all their mights, and either knight smote</a>
<a id='line_7205'>other in midst of the shield. But Sir Gawaine’s spear to-brast, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7206'>Launcelot charged so sore upon him that his horse reversed up-so-down.</a>
<a id='line_7207'>And much sorrow had Sir Gawaine to avoid his horse, and so Sir</a>
<a id='line_7208'>Launcelot passed on a pace and smiled, and said, God give him joy that</a>
<a id='line_7209'>this spear made, for there came never a better in my hand.</a>
<a id='line_7210'></a>
<a id='line_7211'>Then the four knights went each one to other and comforted each other.</a>
<a id='line_7212'>What say ye by this guest? said Sir Gawaine, that one spear hath felled</a>
<a id='line_7213'>us all four. We commend him unto the devil, they said all, for he is a</a>
<a id='line_7214'>man of great might. Ye may well say it, said Sir Gawaine, that he is a</a>
<a id='line_7215'>man of might, for I dare lay my head it is Sir Launcelot, I know it by</a>
<a id='line_7216'>his riding. Let him go, said Sir Gawaine, for when we come to the court</a>
<a id='line_7217'>then shall we wit; and then had they much sorrow to get their horses</a>
<a id='line_7218'>again.</a>
<a id='line_7219'></a>
<a id='line_7220'></a>
<a id='line_7221'></a>
<a id='line_7222'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Launcelot followed a brachet into a castle, where</a>
<a id='line_7223'>he found a dead knight, and how he after was required of a damosel to</a>
<a id='line_7224'>heal her brother.</a>
<a id='line_7225'></a>
<a id='line_7226'>Now leave we there and speak of Sir Launcelot that rode a great while</a>
<a id='line_7227'>in a deep forest, where he saw a black brachet, seeking in manner as it</a>
<a id='line_7228'>had been in the feute of an hurt deer. And therewith he rode after the</a>
<a id='line_7229'>brachet, and he saw lie on the ground a large feute of blood. And then</a>
<a id='line_7230'>Sir Launcelot rode after. And ever the brachet looked behind her, and</a>
<a id='line_7231'>so she went through a great marsh, and ever Sir Launcelot followed. And</a>
<a id='line_7232'>then was he ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so</a>
<a id='line_7233'>over the bridge. So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old</a>
<a id='line_7234'>and feeble; and when he came in midst of a great hall, there he saw lie</a>
<a id='line_7235'>a dead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet licked his</a>
<a id='line_7236'>wounds. And therewithal came out a lady weeping and wringing her hands;</a>
<a id='line_7237'>and then she said, O knight, too much sorrow hast thou brought me. Why</a>
<a id='line_7238'>say ye so? said Sir Launcelot, I did never this knight no harm, for</a>
<a id='line_7239'>hither by feute of blood this brachet brought me; and therefore, fair</a>
<a id='line_7240'>lady, be not displeased with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your</a>
<a id='line_7241'>grievance. Truly, sir, she said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my</a>
<a id='line_7242'>husband, for he that did that deed is sore wounded, and he is never</a>
<a id='line_7243'>likely to recover, that shall I ensure him. What was your husband’s</a>
<a id='line_7244'>name? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said she, his name was called Sir</a>
<a id='line_7245'>Gilbert the Bastard, one of the best knights of the world, and he that</a>
<a id='line_7246'>hath slain him I know not his name. Now God send you better comfort,</a>
<a id='line_7247'>said Sir Launcelot; and so he departed and went into the forest again,</a>
<a id='line_7248'>and there he met with a damosel, the which knew him well, and she said</a>
<a id='line_7249'>aloud, Well be ye found, my lord; and now I require thee, on thy</a>
<a id='line_7250'>knighthood, help my brother that is sore wounded, and never stinteth</a>
<a id='line_7251'>bleeding; for this day he fought with Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew</a>
<a id='line_7252'>him in plain battle, and there was my brother sore wounded, and there</a>
<a id='line_7253'>is a lady a sorceress that dwelleth in a castle here beside, and this</a>
<a id='line_7254'>day she told me my brother’s wounds should never be whole till I could</a>
<a id='line_7255'>find a knight that would go into the Chapel Perilous, and there he</a>
<a id='line_7256'>should find a sword and a bloody cloth that the wounded knight was</a>
<a id='line_7257'>lapped in, and a piece of that cloth and sword should heal my brother’s</a>
<a id='line_7258'>wounds, so that his wounds were searched with the sword and the cloth.</a>
<a id='line_7259'>This is a marvellous thing, said Sir Launcelot, but what is your</a>
<a id='line_7260'>brother’s name? Sir, she said, his name was Sir Meliot de Logres. That</a>
<a id='line_7261'>me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he is a fellow of the Table</a>
<a id='line_7262'>Round, and to his help I will do my power. Then, sir, said she, follow</a>
<a id='line_7263'>even this highway, and it will bring you unto the Chapel Perilous; and</a>
<a id='line_7264'>here I shall abide till God send you here again, and, but you speed, I</a>
<a id='line_7265'>know no knight living that may achieve that adventure.</a>
<a id='line_7266'></a>
<a id='line_7267'></a>
<a id='line_7268'></a>
<a id='line_7269'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat</a>
<a id='line_7270'>there of a dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword.</a>
<a id='line_7271'></a>
<a id='line_7272'>Right so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he came unto the Chapel</a>
<a id='line_7273'>Perilous he alighted down, and tied his horse unto a little gate. And</a>
<a id='line_7274'>as soon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the</a>
<a id='line_7275'>chapel many fair rich shields turned up-so-down, and many of the</a>
<a id='line_7276'>shields Sir Launcelot had seen knights bear beforehand. With that he</a>
<a id='line_7277'>saw by him there stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any</a>
<a id='line_7278'>man that ever he had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir</a>
<a id='line_7279'>Launcelot. And when he saw their countenance he dreaded him sore, and</a>
<a id='line_7280'>so put his shield afore him, and took his sword ready in his hand ready</a>
<a id='line_7281'>unto battle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their</a>
<a id='line_7282'>shields and their swords drawn. And when Sir Launcelot would have gone</a>
<a id='line_7283'>throughout them, they scattered on every side of him, and gave him the</a>
<a id='line_7284'>way, and therewith he waxed all bold, and entered into the chapel, and</a>
<a id='line_7285'>then he saw no light but a dim lamp burning, and then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_7286'>corpse hilled with a cloth of silk. Then Sir Launcelot stooped down,</a>
<a id='line_7287'>and cut a piece away of that cloth, and then it fared under him as the</a>
<a id='line_7288'>earth had quaked a little; therewithal he feared. And then he saw a</a>
<a id='line_7289'>fair sword lie by the dead knight, and that he gat in his hand and hied</a>
<a id='line_7290'>him out of the chapel.</a>
<a id='line_7291'></a>
<a id='line_7292'>Anon as ever he was in the chapel yard all the knights spake to him</a>
<a id='line_7293'>with a grimly voice, and said, Knight, Sir Launcelot, lay that sword</a>
<a id='line_7294'>from thee or else thou shalt die. Whether that I live or die, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7295'>Launcelot, with no great word get ye it again, therefore fight for it</a>
<a id='line_7296'>an ye list. Then right so he passed throughout them, and beyond the</a>
<a id='line_7297'>chapel yard there met him a fair damosel, and said, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7298'>leave that sword behind thee, or thou wilt die for it. I leave it not,</a>
<a id='line_7299'>said Sir Launcelot, for no treaties. No, said she, an thou didst leave</a>
<a id='line_7300'>that sword, Queen Guenever should thou never see. Then were I a fool an</a>
<a id='line_7301'>I would leave this sword, said Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_7302'>damosel, I require thee to kiss me but once. Nay, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7303'>that God me forbid. Well, sir, said she, an thou hadst kissed me thy</a>
<a id='line_7304'>life days had been done, but now, alas, she said, I have lost all my</a>
<a id='line_7305'>labour, for I ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_7306'>And once I had Sir Gawaine within me, and at that time he fought with</a>
<a id='line_7307'>that knight that lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the</a>
<a id='line_7308'>Bastard; and at that time he smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the</a>
<a id='line_7309'>Bastard. And, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this</a>
<a id='line_7310'>seven year, but there may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_7311'>But sithen I may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no</a>
<a id='line_7312'>more joy in this world but to have thy body dead. Then would I have</a>
<a id='line_7313'>balmed it and served it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I</a>
<a id='line_7314'>should have clipped thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen</a>
<a id='line_7315'>Guenever. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu preserve me from your</a>
<a id='line_7316'>subtle crafts. And therewithal he took his horse and so departed from</a>
<a id='line_7317'>her. And as the book saith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she took</a>
<a id='line_7318'>such sorrow that she died within a fourteen night, and her name was</a>
<a id='line_7319'>Hellawes the sorceress, Lady of the Castle Nigramous.</a>
<a id='line_7320'></a>
<a id='line_7321'>Anon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot’s sister. And when</a>
<a id='line_7322'>she saw him she clapped her hands, and wept for joy. And then they rode</a>
<a id='line_7323'>unto a castle thereby where lay Sir Meliot. And anon as Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7324'>saw him he knew him, but he was passing pale, as the earth, for</a>
<a id='line_7325'>bleeding. When Sir Meliot saw Sir Launcelot he kneeled upon his knees</a>
<a id='line_7326'>and cried on high: O lord Sir Launcelot, help me! Anon Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7327'>leapt unto him and touched his wounds with Sir Gilbert’s sword. And</a>
<a id='line_7328'>then he wiped his wounds with a part of the bloody cloth that Sir</a>
<a id='line_7329'>Gilbert was wrapped in, and anon an wholer man in his life was he</a>
<a id='line_7330'>never. And then there was great joy between them, and they made Sir</a>
<a id='line_7331'>Launcelot all the cheer that they might, and so on the morn Sir</a>
<a id='line_7332'>Launcelot took his leave, and bade Sir Meliot hie him to the court of</a>
<a id='line_7333'>my lord Arthur, for it draweth nigh to the Feast of Pentecost, and</a>
<a id='line_7334'>there by the grace of God ye shall find me. And therewith they</a>
<a id='line_7335'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_7336'></a>
<a id='line_7337'></a>
<a id='line_7338'></a>
<a id='line_7339'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Launcelot at the request of a lady recovered a</a>
<a id='line_7340'>falcon, by which he was deceived.</a>
<a id='line_7341'></a>
<a id='line_7342'>And so Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries, over marshes</a>
<a id='line_7343'>and valleys, till by fortune he came to a fair castle, and as he passed</a>
<a id='line_7344'>beyond the castle him thought he heard two bells ring. And then was he</a>
<a id='line_7345'>ware of a falcon came flying over his head toward an high elm, and long</a>
<a id='line_7346'>lunes about her feet, and as she flew unto the elm to take her perch</a>
<a id='line_7347'>the lunes over-cast about a bough. And when she would have taken her</a>
<a id='line_7348'>flight she hung by the legs fast; and Sir Launcelot saw how she hung,</a>
<a id='line_7349'>and beheld the fair falcon perigot, and he was sorry for her.</a>
<a id='line_7350'></a>
<a id='line_7351'>The meanwhile came a lady out of the castle and cried on high: O</a>
<a id='line_7352'>Launcelot, Launcelot, as thou art flower of all knights, help me to get</a>
<a id='line_7353'>my hawk, for an my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me; for I kept the</a>
<a id='line_7354'>hawk and she slipped from me, and if my lord my husband wit it he is so</a>
<a id='line_7355'>hasty that he will slay me. What is your lord’s name? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7356'>Launcelot. Sir, she said, his name is Sir Phelot, a knight that longeth</a>
<a id='line_7357'>unto the King of Northgalis. Well, fair lady, since that ye know my</a>
<a id='line_7358'>name, and require me of knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to</a>
<a id='line_7359'>get your hawk, and yet God knoweth I am an ill climber, and the tree is</a>
<a id='line_7360'>passing high, and few boughs to help me withal. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_7361'>Launcelot alighted, and tied his horse to the same tree, and prayed the</a>
<a id='line_7362'>lady to unarm him. And so when he was unarmed, he put off all his</a>
<a id='line_7363'>clothes unto his shirt and breech, and with might and force he clomb up</a>
<a id='line_7364'>to the falcon, and tied the lines to a great rotten boyshe, and threw</a>
<a id='line_7365'>the hawk down and it withal.</a>
<a id='line_7366'></a>
<a id='line_7367'>Anon the lady gat the hawk in her hand; and therewithal came out Sir</a>
<a id='line_7368'>Phelot out of the groves suddenly, that was her husband, all armed and</a>
<a id='line_7369'>with his naked sword in his hand, and said: O knight Launcelot, now</a>
<a id='line_7370'>have I found thee as I would, and stood at the bole of the tree to slay</a>
<a id='line_7371'>him. Ah, lady, said Sir Launcelot, why have ye betrayed me? She hath</a>
<a id='line_7372'>done, said Sir Phelot, but as I commanded her, and therefore there nis</a>
<a id='line_7373'>none other boot but thine hour is come that thou must die. That were</a>
<a id='line_7374'>shame unto thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou an armed knight to slay a</a>
<a id='line_7375'>naked man by treason. Thou gettest none other grace, said Sir Phelot,</a>
<a id='line_7376'>and therefore help thyself an thou canst. Truly, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7377'>that shall be thy shame, but since thou wilt do none other, take mine</a>
<a id='line_7378'>harness with thee, and hang my sword upon a bough that I may get it,</a>
<a id='line_7379'>and then do thy best to slay me an thou canst. Nay, nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7380'>Phelot, for I know thee better than thou weenest, therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_7381'>gettest no weapon, an I may keep you therefrom. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7382'>Launcelot, that ever a knight should die weaponless. And therewith he</a>
<a id='line_7383'>waited above him and under him, and over his head he saw a rownsepyk, a</a>
<a id='line_7384'>big bough leafless, and therewith he brake it off by the body. And then</a>
<a id='line_7385'>he came lower and awaited how his own horse stood, and suddenly he</a>
<a id='line_7386'>leapt on the further side of the horse, fro-ward the knight. And then</a>
<a id='line_7387'>Sir Phelot lashed at him eagerly, weening to have slain him. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_7388'>Launcelot put away the stroke with the rownsepyk, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_7389'>smote him on the one side of the head, that he fell down in a swoon to</a>
<a id='line_7390'>the ground. So then Sir Launcelot took his sword out of his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_7391'>struck his neck from the body. Then cried the lady, Alas! why hast thou</a>
<a id='line_7392'>slain my husband? I am not causer, said Sir Launcelot, for with</a>
<a id='line_7393'>falsehood ye would have had slain me with treason, and now it is fallen</a>
<a id='line_7394'>on you both. And then she swooned as though she would die. And</a>
<a id='line_7395'>therewithal Sir Launcelot gat all his armour as well as he might, and</a>
<a id='line_7396'>put it upon him for dread of more resort, for he dreaded that the</a>
<a id='line_7397'>knight’s castle was so nigh. And so, as soon as he might, he took his</a>
<a id='line_7398'>horse and departed, and thanked God that he had escaped that adventure.</a>
<a id='line_7399'></a>
<a id='line_7400'></a>
<a id='line_7401'></a>
<a id='line_7402'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot overtook a knight which chased his wife</a>
<a id='line_7403'>to have slain her, and how he said to him.</a>
<a id='line_7404'></a>
<a id='line_7405'>So Sir Launcelot rode many wild ways, throughout marches and many wild</a>
<a id='line_7406'>ways. And as he rode in a valley he saw a knight chasing a lady, with a</a>
<a id='line_7407'>naked sword, to have slain her. And by fortune as this knight should</a>
<a id='line_7408'>have slain this lady, she cried on Sir Launcelot and prayed him to</a>
<a id='line_7409'>rescue her. When Sir Launcelot saw that mischief, he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_7410'>rode between them, saying, Knight, fie for shame, why wilt thou slay</a>
<a id='line_7411'>this lady? thou dost shame unto thee and all knights. What hast thou to</a>
<a id='line_7412'>do betwixt me and my wife? said the knight. I will slay her maugre thy</a>
<a id='line_7413'>head. That shall ye not, said Sir Launcelot, for rather we two will</a>
<a id='line_7414'>have ado together. Sir Launcelot, said the knight, thou dost not thy</a>
<a id='line_7415'>part, for this lady hath betrayed me. It is not so, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_7416'>truly he saith wrong on me. And for because I love and cherish my</a>
<a id='line_7417'>cousin germain, he is jealous betwixt him and me; and as I shall answer</a>
<a id='line_7418'>to God there was never sin betwixt us. But, sir, said the lady, as thou</a>
<a id='line_7419'>art called the worshipfullest knight of the world, I require thee of</a>
<a id='line_7420'>true knighthood, keep me and save me. For whatsomever ye say he will</a>
<a id='line_7421'>slay me, for he is without mercy. Have ye no doubt, said Launcelot, it</a>
<a id='line_7422'>shall not lie in his power. Sir, said the knight, in your sight I will</a>
<a id='line_7423'>be ruled as ye will have me. And so Sir Launcelot rode on the one side</a>
<a id='line_7424'>and she on the other: he had not ridden but a while, but the knight</a>
<a id='line_7425'>bade Sir Launcelot turn him and look behind him, and said, Sir, yonder</a>
<a id='line_7426'>come men of arms after us riding. And so Sir Launcelot turned him and</a>
<a id='line_7427'>thought no treason, and therewith was the knight and the lady on one</a>
<a id='line_7428'>side, and suddenly he swapped off his lady’s head.</a>
<a id='line_7429'></a>
<a id='line_7430'>And when Sir Launcelot had espied him what he had done, he said, and</a>
<a id='line_7431'>called him, Traitor, thou hast shamed me for ever. And suddenly Sir</a>
<a id='line_7432'>Launcelot alighted off his horse, and pulled out his sword to slay him,</a>
<a id='line_7433'>and therewithal he fell flat to the earth, and gripped Sir Launcelot by</a>
<a id='line_7434'>the thighs, and cried mercy. Fie on thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou</a>
<a id='line_7435'>shameful knight, thou mayest have no mercy, and therefore arise and</a>
<a id='line_7436'>fight with me. Nay, said the knight, I will never arise till ye grant</a>
<a id='line_7437'>me mercy. Now will I proffer thee fair, said Launcelot, I will unarm me</a>
<a id='line_7438'>unto my shirt, and I will have nothing upon me but my shirt, and my</a>
<a id='line_7439'>sword and my hand. And if thou canst slay me, quit be thou for ever.</a>
<a id='line_7440'>Nay, sir, said Pedivere, that will I never. Well, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7441'>take this lady and the head, and bear it upon thee, and here shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_7442'>swear upon my sword, to bear it always upon thy back, and never to rest</a>
<a id='line_7443'>till thou come to Queen Guenever. Sir, said he, that will I do, by the</a>
<a id='line_7444'>faith of my body. Now, said Launcelot, tell me what is your name? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7445'>my name is Pedivere. In a shameful hour wert thou born, said Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7446'></a>
<a id='line_7447'>So Pedivere departed with the dead lady and the head, and found the</a>
<a id='line_7448'>queen with King Arthur at Winchester, and there he told all the truth.</a>
<a id='line_7449'>Sir knight, said the queen, this is an horrible deed and a shameful,</a>
<a id='line_7450'>and a great rebuke unto Sir Launcelot; but notwithstanding his worship</a>
<a id='line_7451'>is not known in many divers countries; but this shall I give you in</a>
<a id='line_7452'>penance, make ye as good shift as ye can, ye shall bear this lady with</a>
<a id='line_7453'>you on horseback unto the Pope of Rome, and of him receive your penance</a>
<a id='line_7454'>for your foul deeds; and ye shall never rest one night whereas ye do</a>
<a id='line_7455'>another; an ye go to any bed the dead body shall lie with you. This</a>
<a id='line_7456'>oath there he made, and so departed. And as it telleth in the French</a>
<a id='line_7457'>book, when he came to Rome, the Pope bade him go again unto Queen</a>
<a id='line_7458'>Guenever, and in Rome was his lady buried by the Pope’s commandment.</a>
<a id='line_7459'>And after this Sir Pedivere fell to great goodness, and was an holy man</a>
<a id='line_7460'>and an hermit.</a>

<a id='line_7464'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur’s Court, and how</a>
<a id='line_7465'>there were recounted all his noble feats and acts.</a>
<a id='line_7466'></a>
<a id='line_7467'>Now turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days afore</a>
<a id='line_7468'>the Feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were passing</a>
<a id='line_7469'>fain of his coming. And when Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore,</a>
<a id='line_7470'>Sir Ector de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay’s armour, then they wist</a>
<a id='line_7471'>well it was he that smote them down all with one spear. Then there was</a>
<a id='line_7472'>laughing and smiling among them. And ever now and now came all the</a>
<a id='line_7473'>knights home that Sir Turquine had prisoners, and they all honoured and</a>
<a id='line_7474'>worshipped Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7475'></a>
<a id='line_7476'>When Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he said, I saw all the battle from</a>
<a id='line_7477'>the beginning to the ending, and there he told King Arthur all how it</a>
<a id='line_7478'>was, and how Sir Turquine was the strongest knight that ever he saw</a>
<a id='line_7479'>except Sir Launcelot: there were many knights bare him record, nigh</a>
<a id='line_7480'>three score. Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued</a>
<a id='line_7481'>him when he should have been slain, and how he made the knights yield</a>
<a id='line_7482'>them to me, and not to him. And there they were all three, and bare</a>
<a id='line_7483'>record. And by Jesu, said Sir Kay, because Sir Launcelot took my</a>
<a id='line_7484'>harness and left me his I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado</a>
<a id='line_7485'>with me.</a>
<a id='line_7486'></a>
<a id='line_7487'>Anon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with Sir</a>
<a id='line_7488'>Launcelot at the long bridge. And there they yielded them unto Sir Kay,</a>
<a id='line_7489'>and Sir Kay forsook them and said he fought never with them. But I</a>
<a id='line_7490'>shall ease your heart, said Sir Kay, yonder is Sir Launcelot that</a>
<a id='line_7491'>overcame you. When they wist that they were glad. And then Sir Meliot</a>
<a id='line_7492'>de Logres came home, and told the king how Sir Launcelot had saved him</a>
<a id='line_7493'>from the death. And all his deeds were known, how four queens,</a>
<a id='line_7494'>sorceresses, had him in prison, and how he was delivered by King</a>
<a id='line_7495'>Bagdemagus’ daughter. Also there were told all the great deeds of arms</a>
<a id='line_7496'>that Sir Launcelot did betwixt the two kings, that is for to say the</a>
<a id='line_7497'>King of Northgalis and King Bagdemagus. All the truth Sir Gahalantine</a>
<a id='line_7498'>did tell, and Sir Mador de la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they were at</a>
<a id='line_7499'>that same tournament. Then came in the lady that knew Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7500'>when that he wounded Sir Belleus at the pavilion. And there, at request</a>
<a id='line_7501'>of Sir Launcelot, Sir Belleus was made knight of the Round Table. And</a>
<a id='line_7502'>so at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight of</a>
<a id='line_7503'>the world, and most he was honoured of high and low.</a>
<a id='line_7504'></a>
<a id='line_7505'> Explicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake, which is the vi.</a>
<a id='line_7506'> book. Here followeth the tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that was called</a>
<a id='line_7507'> Beaumains by Sir Kay, and is the seventh book.</a>

<a id='line_7512'></a>
<a id='line_7513'></a>
<a id='line_7514'></a>
<a id='line_7515'>CHAPTER I. How Beaumains came to King Arthur’s Court and demanded three</a>
<a id='line_7516'>petitions of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_7517'></a>
<a id='line_7518'>When Arthur held his Round Table most plenour, it fortuned that he</a>
<a id='line_7519'>commanded that the high feast of Pentecost should be holden at a city</a>
<a id='line_7520'>and a castle, the which in those days was called Kynke Kenadonne, upon</a>
<a id='line_7521'>the sands that marched nigh Wales. So ever the king had a custom that</a>
<a id='line_7522'>at the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year,</a>
<a id='line_7523'>he would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great</a>
<a id='line_7524'>marvel. And for that custom all manner of strange adventures came</a>
<a id='line_7525'>before Arthur as at that feast before all other feasts. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_7526'>Gawaine, a little to-fore noon of the day of Pentecost, espied at a</a>
<a id='line_7527'>window three men upon horseback, and a dwarf on foot, and so the three</a>
<a id='line_7528'>men alighted, and the dwarf kept their horses, and one of the three men</a>
<a id='line_7529'>was higher than the other twain by a foot and an half. Then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_7530'>went unto the king and said, Sir, go to your meat, for here at the hand</a>
<a id='line_7531'>come strange adventures. So Arthur went unto his meat with many other</a>
<a id='line_7532'>kings. And there were all the knights of the Round Table, [save] only</a>
<a id='line_7533'>those that were prisoners or slain at a recounter. Then at the high</a>
<a id='line_7534'>feast evermore they should be fulfilled the whole number of an hundred</a>
<a id='line_7535'>and fifty, for then was the Round Table fully complished.</a>
<a id='line_7536'></a>
<a id='line_7537'>Right so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly, and upon</a>
<a id='line_7538'>their shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest</a>
<a id='line_7539'>that ever they all saw, and he was large and long, and broad in the</a>
<a id='line_7540'>shoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest handed</a>
<a id='line_7541'>that ever man saw, but he fared as though he might not go nor bear</a>
<a id='line_7542'>himself but if he leaned upon their shoulders. Anon as Arthur saw him</a>
<a id='line_7543'>there was made peace and room, and right so they yede with him unto the</a>
<a id='line_7544'>high dais, without saying of any words. Then this much young man pulled</a>
<a id='line_7545'>him aback, and easily stretched up straight, saying, King Arthur, God</a>
<a id='line_7546'>you bless and all your fair fellowship, and in especial the fellowship</a>
<a id='line_7547'>of the Table Round. And for this cause I am come hither, to pray you</a>
<a id='line_7548'>and require you to give me three gifts, and they shall not be</a>
<a id='line_7549'>unreasonably asked, but that ye may worshipfully and honourably grant</a>
<a id='line_7550'>them me, and to you no great hurt nor loss. And the first don and gift</a>
<a id='line_7551'>I will ask now, and the other two gifts I will ask this day</a>
<a id='line_7552'>twelvemonth, wheresomever ye hold your high feast. Now ask, said</a>
<a id='line_7553'>Arthur, and ye shall have your asking.</a>
<a id='line_7554'></a>
<a id='line_7555'>Now, sir, this is my petition for this feast, that ye will give me meat</a>
<a id='line_7556'>and drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will ask</a>
<a id='line_7557'>mine other two gifts.</a>
<a id='line_7558'></a>
<a id='line_7559'>My fair son, said Arthur, ask better, I counsel thee, for this is but a</a>
<a id='line_7560'>simple asking; for my heart giveth me to thee greatly, that thou art</a>
<a id='line_7561'>come of men of worship, and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou</a>
<a id='line_7562'>shalt prove a man of right great worship. Sir, he said, thereof be as</a>
<a id='line_7563'>it be may, I have asked that I will ask. Well, said the king, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_7564'>have meat and drink enough; I never defended that none, neither my</a>
<a id='line_7565'>friend nor my foe. But what is thy name I would wit? I cannot tell you,</a>
<a id='line_7566'>said he. That is marvel, said the king, that thou knowest not thy name,</a>
<a id='line_7567'>and thou art the goodliest young man that ever I saw. Then the king</a>
<a id='line_7568'>betook him to Sir Kay the steward, and charged him that he should give</a>
<a id='line_7569'>him of all manner of meats and drinks of the best, and also that he had</a>
<a id='line_7570'>all manner of finding as though he were a lord’s son. That shall little</a>
<a id='line_7571'>need, said Sir Kay, to do such cost upon him; for I dare undertake he</a>
<a id='line_7572'>is a villain born, and never will make man, for an he had come of</a>
<a id='line_7573'>gentlemen he would have asked of you horse and armour, but such as he</a>
<a id='line_7574'>is, so he asketh. And sithen he hath no name, I shall give him a name</a>
<a id='line_7575'>that shall be Beaumains, that is Fair-hands, and into the kitchen I</a>
<a id='line_7576'>shall bring him, and there he shall have fat brose every day, that he</a>
<a id='line_7577'>shall be as fat by the twelvemonths’ end as a pork hog. Right so the</a>
<a id='line_7578'>two men departed and beleft him to Sir Kay, that scorned him and mocked</a>
<a id='line_7579'>him.</a>
<a id='line_7580'></a>
<a id='line_7581'></a>
<a id='line_7582'></a>
<a id='line_7583'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth because Sir</a>
<a id='line_7584'>Kay mocked Beaumains, and of a damosel which desired a knight to fight</a>
<a id='line_7585'>for a lady.</a>
<a id='line_7586'></a>
<a id='line_7587'>Thereat was Sir Gawaine wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bade Sir</a>
<a id='line_7588'>Kay leave his mocking, for I dare lay my head he shall prove a man of</a>
<a id='line_7589'>great worship. Let be said Sir Kay, it may not be by no reason, for as</a>
<a id='line_7590'>he is, so he hath asked. Beware, said Sir Launcelot, so ye gave the</a>
<a id='line_7591'>good knight Brewnor, Sir Dinadan’s brother, a name, and ye called him</a>
<a id='line_7592'>La Cote Male Taile, and that turned you to anger afterward. As for</a>
<a id='line_7593'>that, said Sir Kay, this shall never prove none such. For Sir Brewnor</a>
<a id='line_7594'>desired ever worship, and this desireth bread and drink and broth; upon</a>
<a id='line_7595'>pain of my life he was fostered up in some abbey, and, howsomever it</a>
<a id='line_7596'>was, they failed meat and drink, and so hither he is come for his</a>
<a id='line_7597'>sustenance.</a>
<a id='line_7598'></a>
<a id='line_7599'>And so Sir Kay bade get him a place, and sit down to meat; so Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_7600'>went to the hall door, and set him down among boys and lads, and there</a>
<a id='line_7601'>he ate sadly. And then Sir Launcelot after meat bade him come to his</a>
<a id='line_7602'>chamber, and there he should have meat and drink enough. And so did Sir</a>
<a id='line_7603'>Gawaine: but he refused them all; he would do none other but as Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_7604'>commanded him, for no proffer. But as touching Sir Gawaine, he had</a>
<a id='line_7605'>reason to proffer him lodging, meat, and drink, for that proffer came</a>
<a id='line_7606'>of his blood, for he was nearer kin to him than he wist. But that as</a>
<a id='line_7607'>Sir Launcelot did was of his great gentleness and courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_7608'></a>
<a id='line_7609'>So thus he was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys of the</a>
<a id='line_7610'>kitchen did. And so he endured all that twelvemonth, and never</a>
<a id='line_7611'>displeased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But ever</a>
<a id='line_7612'>when that he saw any jousting of knights, that would he see an he</a>
<a id='line_7613'>might. And ever Sir Launcelot would give him gold to spend, and</a>
<a id='line_7614'>clothes, and so did Sir Gawaine, and where there were any masteries</a>
<a id='line_7615'>done, thereat would he be, and there might none cast bar nor stone to</a>
<a id='line_7616'>him by two yards. Then would Sir Kay say, How liketh you my boy of the</a>
<a id='line_7617'>kitchen? So it passed on till the feast of Whitsuntide. And at that</a>
<a id='line_7618'>time the king held it at Carlion in the most royallest wise that might</a>
<a id='line_7619'>be, like as he did yearly. But the king would no meat eat upon the</a>
<a id='line_7620'>Whitsunday, until he heard some adventures. Then came there a squire to</a>
<a id='line_7621'>the king and said, Sir, ye may go to your meat, for here cometh a</a>
<a id='line_7622'>damosel with some strange adventures. Then was the king glad and sat</a>
<a id='line_7623'>him down.</a>
<a id='line_7624'></a>
<a id='line_7625'>Right so there came a damosel into the hall and saluted the king, and</a>
<a id='line_7626'>prayed him of succour. For whom? said the king, what is the adventure?</a>
<a id='line_7627'></a>
<a id='line_7628'>Sir, she said, I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she is</a>
<a id='line_7629'>besieged with a tyrant, so that she may not out of her castle; and</a>
<a id='line_7630'>because here are called the noblest knights of the world, I come to you</a>
<a id='line_7631'>to pray you of succour. What hight your lady, and where dwelleth she,</a>
<a id='line_7632'>and who is she, and what is his name that hath besieged her? Sir king,</a>
<a id='line_7633'>she said, as for my lady’s name that shall not ye know for me as at</a>
<a id='line_7634'>this time, but I let you wit she is a lady of great worship and of</a>
<a id='line_7635'>great lands; and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth</a>
<a id='line_7636'>her lands, he is called the Red Knight of the Red Launds. I know him</a>
<a id='line_7637'>not, said the king. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I know him well, for he is</a>
<a id='line_7638'>one of the perilloust knights of the world; men say that he hath seven</a>
<a id='line_7639'>men’s strength, and from him I escaped once full hard with my life.</a>
<a id='line_7640'>Fair damosel, said the king, there be knights here would do their power</a>
<a id='line_7641'>for to rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her name, nor</a>
<a id='line_7642'>where she dwelleth, therefore none of my knights that here be now shall</a>
<a id='line_7643'>go with you by my will. Then must I speak further, said the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7644'></a>
<a id='line_7645'></a>
<a id='line_7646'></a>
<a id='line_7647'>CHAPTER III. How Beaumains desired the battle, and how it was granted</a>
<a id='line_7648'>to him, and how he desired to be made knight of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7649'></a>
<a id='line_7650'>With these words came before the king Beaumains, while the damosel was</a>
<a id='line_7651'>there, and thus he said, Sir king, God thank you, I have been this</a>
<a id='line_7652'>twelvemonth in your kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and now I</a>
<a id='line_7653'>will ask my two gifts that be behind. Ask, upon my peril, said the</a>
<a id='line_7654'>king. Sir, this shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me to</a>
<a id='line_7655'>have this adventure of the damosel, for it belongeth unto me. Thou</a>
<a id='line_7656'>shalt have it, said the king, I grant it thee. Then, sir, this is the</a>
<a id='line_7657'>other gift, that ye shall bid Launcelot du Lake to make me knight, for</a>
<a id='line_7658'>of him I will be made knight and else of none. And when I am passed I</a>
<a id='line_7659'>pray you let him ride after me, and make me knight when I require him.</a>
<a id='line_7660'>All this shall be done, said the king. Fie on thee, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_7661'>shall I have none but one that is your kitchen page? Then was she wroth</a>
<a id='line_7662'>and took her horse and departed. And with that there came one to</a>
<a id='line_7663'>Beaumains and told him his horse and armour was come for him; and there</a>
<a id='line_7664'>was the dwarf come with all thing that him needed, in the richest</a>
<a id='line_7665'>manner; thereat all the court had much marvel from whence came all that</a>
<a id='line_7666'>gear. So when he was armed there was none but few so goodly a man as he</a>
<a id='line_7667'>was; and right so as he came into the hall and took his leave of King</a>
<a id='line_7668'>Arthur, and Sir Gawaine, and Sir Launcelot, and prayed that he would</a>
<a id='line_7669'>hie after him, and so departed and rode after the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7670'></a>
<a id='line_7671'></a>
<a id='line_7672'></a>
<a id='line_7673'>CHAPTER IV. How Beaumains departed, and how he gat of Sir Kay a spear</a>
<a id='line_7674'>and a shield, and how he jousted with Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7675'></a>
<a id='line_7676'>But there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and trapped</a>
<a id='line_7677'>in cloth of gold, but he had neither shield nor spear. Then Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_7678'>said all open in the hall, I will ride after my boy in the kitchen, to</a>
<a id='line_7679'>wit whether he will know me for his better. Said Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7680'>Gawaine, Yet abide at home. So Sir Kay made him ready and took his</a>
<a id='line_7681'>horse and his spear, and rode after him. And right as Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_7682'>overtook the damosel, right so came Sir Kay and said, Beaumains, what,</a>
<a id='line_7683'>sir, know ye not me? Then he turned his horse, and knew it was Sir Kay,</a>
<a id='line_7684'>that had done him all the despite as ye have heard afore. Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_7685'>Beaumains, I know you for an ungentle knight of the court, and</a>
<a id='line_7686'>therefore beware of me. Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7687'>and ran straight upon him; and Beaumains came as fast upon him with his</a>
<a id='line_7688'>sword in his hand, and so he put away his spear with his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_7689'>with a foin thrust him through the side, that Sir Kay fell down as he</a>
<a id='line_7690'>had been dead; and he alighted down and took Sir Kay’s shield and his</a>
<a id='line_7691'>spear, and stert upon his own horse and rode his way.</a>
<a id='line_7692'></a>
<a id='line_7693'>All that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel. And then he bade</a>
<a id='line_7694'>his dwarf stert upon Sir Kay’s horse, and so he did. By that Sir</a>
<a id='line_7695'>Launcelot was come, then he proffered Sir Launcelot to joust; and</a>
<a id='line_7696'>either made them ready, and they came together so fiercely that either</a>
<a id='line_7697'>bare down other to the earth, and sore were they bruised. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_7698'>Launcelot arose and helped him from his horse. And then Beaumains threw</a>
<a id='line_7699'>his shield from him, and proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot;</a>
<a id='line_7700'>and so they rushed together like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to</a>
<a id='line_7701'>the mountenance of an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him so big that he</a>
<a id='line_7702'>marvelled of his strength, for he fought more liker a giant than a</a>
<a id='line_7703'>knight, and that his fighting was durable and passing perilous. For Sir</a>
<a id='line_7704'>Launcelot had so much ado with him that he dreaded himself to be</a>
<a id='line_7705'>shamed, and said, Beaumains, fight not so sore, your quarrel and mine</a>
<a id='line_7706'>is not so great but we may leave off. Truly that is truth, said</a>
<a id='line_7707'>Beaumains, but it doth me good to feel your might, and yet, my lord, I</a>
<a id='line_7708'>showed not the utterance.</a>

<a id='line_7715'>In God’s name, said Sir Launcelot, for I promise you, by the faith of</a>
<a id='line_7716'>my body, I had as much to do as I might to save myself from you</a>
<a id='line_7717'>unshamed, and therefore have ye no doubt of none earthly knight. Hope</a>
<a id='line_7718'>ye so that I may any while stand a proved knight? said Beaumains. Yea,</a>
<a id='line_7719'>said Launcelot, do as ye have done, and I shall be your warrant. Then,</a>
<a id='line_7720'>I pray you, said Beaumains, give me the order of knighthood. Then must</a>
<a id='line_7721'>ye tell me your name, said Launcelot, and of what kin ye be born. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7722'>so that ye will not discover me I shall, said Beaumains. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7723'>Launcelot, and that I promise you by the faith of my body, until it be</a>
<a id='line_7724'>openly known. Then, sir, he said, my name is Gareth, and brother unto</a>
<a id='line_7725'>Sir Gawaine of father and mother. Ah, sir, said Sir Launcelot, I am</a>
<a id='line_7726'>more gladder of you than I was; for ever me thought ye should be of</a>
<a id='line_7727'>great blood, and that ye came not to the court neither for meat nor for</a>
<a id='line_7728'>drink. And then Sir Launcelot gave him the order of knighthood, and</a>
<a id='line_7729'>then Sir Gareth prayed him for to depart and let him go.</a>
<a id='line_7730'></a>
<a id='line_7731'>So Sir Launcelot departed from him and came to Sir Kay, and made him to</a>
<a id='line_7732'>be borne home upon his shield, and so he was healed hard with the life;</a>
<a id='line_7733'>and all men scorned Sir Kay, and in especial Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7734'>Launcelot said it was not his part to rebuke no young man, for full</a>
<a id='line_7735'>little knew he of what birth he is come, and for what cause he came to</a>
<a id='line_7736'>this court; and so we leave Sir Kay and turn we unto Beaumains.</a>
<a id='line_7737'></a>
<a id='line_7738'>When he had overtaken the damosel, anon she said, What dost thou here?</a>
<a id='line_7739'>thou stinkest all of the kitchen, thy clothes be bawdy of the grease</a>
<a id='line_7740'>and tallow that thou gainest in King Arthur’s kitchen; weenest thou,</a>
<a id='line_7741'>said she, that I allow thee, for yonder knight that thou killest. Nay</a>
<a id='line_7742'>truly, for thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly; therefore turn</a>
<a id='line_7743'>again, bawdy kitchen page, I know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee</a>
<a id='line_7744'>Beaumains. What art thou but a lusk and a turner of broaches and a</a>
<a id='line_7745'>ladle-washer? Damosel, said Beaumains, say to me what ye will, I will</a>
<a id='line_7746'>not go from you whatsomever ye say, for I have undertaken to King</a>
<a id='line_7747'>Arthur for to achieve your adventure, and so shall I finish it to the</a>
<a id='line_7748'>end, either I shall die therefore. Fie on thee, kitchen knave, wilt</a>
<a id='line_7749'>thou finish mine adventure? thou shalt anon be met withal, that thou</a>
<a id='line_7750'>wouldest not for all the broth that ever thou suppest once look him in</a>
<a id='line_7751'>the face. I shall assay, said Beaumains.</a>
<a id='line_7752'></a>
<a id='line_7753'>So thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all that ever</a>
<a id='line_7754'>he might. Whither wilt thou? said Beaumains. O lord, he said, help me,</a>
<a id='line_7755'>for here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and</a>
<a id='line_7756'>bound him, so I am afeard lest they will slay him. Bring me thither,</a>
<a id='line_7757'>said Beaumains. And so they rode together until they came thereas was</a>
<a id='line_7758'>the knight bounden; and then he rode unto them, and struck one unto the</a>
<a id='line_7759'>death, and then another, and at the third stroke he slew the third</a>
<a id='line_7760'>thief, and then the other three fled. And he rode after them, and he</a>
<a id='line_7761'>overtook them; and then those three thieves turned again and assailed</a>
<a id='line_7762'>Beaumains hard, but at the last he slew them, and returned and unbound</a>
<a id='line_7763'>the knight. And the knight thanked him, and prayed him to ride with him</a>
<a id='line_7764'>to his castle there a little beside, and he should worshipfully reward</a>
<a id='line_7765'>him for his good deeds. Sir, said Beaumains, I will no reward have: I</a>
<a id='line_7766'>was this day made knight of noble Sir Launcelot, and therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_7767'>no reward have, but God reward me. And also I must follow this damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7768'></a>
<a id='line_7769'>And when he came nigh her she bade him ride from her, For thou smellest</a>
<a id='line_7770'>all of the kitchen: weenest thou that I have joy of thee, for all this</a>
<a id='line_7771'>deed that thou hast done is but mishapped thee: but thou shalt see a</a>
<a id='line_7772'>sight shall make thee turn again, and that lightly. Then the same</a>
<a id='line_7773'>knight which was rescued of the thieves rode after that damosel, and</a>
<a id='line_7774'>prayed her to lodge with him all that night. And because it was near</a>
<a id='line_7775'>night the damosel rode with him to his castle, and there they had great</a>
<a id='line_7776'>cheer, and at supper the knight sat Sir Beaumains afore the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7777'>Fie, fie, said she, Sir knight, ye are uncourteous to set a kitchen</a>
<a id='line_7778'>page afore me; him beseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit afore</a>
<a id='line_7779'>a damosel of high parage. Then the knight was ashamed at her words, and</a>
<a id='line_7780'>took him up, and set him at a sideboard, and set himself afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_7781'>so all that night they had good cheer and merry rest.</a>
<a id='line_7782'></a>
<a id='line_7783'></a>
<a id='line_7784'></a>
<a id='line_7785'>CHAPTER VI. How Beaumains fought and slew two knights at a passage.</a>
<a id='line_7786'></a>
<a id='line_7787'>And on the morn the damosel and he took their leave and thanked the</a>
<a id='line_7788'>knight, and so departed, and rode on their way until they came to a</a>
<a id='line_7789'>great forest. And there was a great river and but one passage, and</a>
<a id='line_7790'>there were ready two knights on the farther side to let them the</a>
<a id='line_7791'>passage. What sayest thou, said the damosel, wilt thou match yonder</a>
<a id='line_7792'>knights or turn again? Nay, said Sir Beaumains, I will not turn again</a>
<a id='line_7793'>an they were six more. And therewithal he rushed into the water, and in</a>
<a id='line_7794'>midst of the water either brake their spears upon other to their hands,</a>
<a id='line_7795'>and then they drew their swords, and smote eagerly at other. And at the</a>
<a id='line_7796'>last Sir Beaumains smote the other upon the helm that his head stonied,</a>
<a id='line_7797'>and therewithal he fell down in the water, and there was he drowned.</a>
<a id='line_7798'>And then he spurred his horse upon the land, where the other knight</a>
<a id='line_7799'>fell upon him, and brake his spear, and so they drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_7800'>fought long together. At the last Sir Beaumains clave his helm and his</a>
<a id='line_7801'>head down to the shoulders; and so he rode unto the damosel and bade</a>
<a id='line_7802'>her ride forth on her way.</a>
<a id='line_7803'></a>
<a id='line_7804'>Alas, she said, that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to</a>
<a id='line_7805'>destroy such two doughty knights: thou weenest thou hast done</a>
<a id='line_7806'>doughtily, that is not so; for the first knight his horse stumbled, and</a>
<a id='line_7807'>there he was drowned in the water, and never it was by thy force, nor</a>
<a id='line_7808'>by thy might. And the last knight by mishap thou camest behind him and</a>
<a id='line_7809'>mishappily thou slew him.</a>
<a id='line_7810'></a>
<a id='line_7811'>Damosel, said Beaumains, ye may say what ye will, but with whomsomever</a>
<a id='line_7812'>I have ado withal, I trust to God to serve him or he depart. And</a>
<a id='line_7813'>therefore I reck not what ye say, so that I may win your lady. Fie,</a>
<a id='line_7814'>fie, foul kitchen knave, thou shalt see knights that shall abate thy</a>
<a id='line_7815'>boast. Fair damosel, give me goodly language, and then my care is past,</a>
<a id='line_7816'>for what knights somever they be, I care not, nor I doubt them not.</a>
<a id='line_7817'>Also, said she, I say it for thine avail, yet mayest thou turn again</a>
<a id='line_7818'>with thy worship; for an thou follow me, thou art but slain, for I see</a>
<a id='line_7819'>all that ever thou dost is but by misadventure, and not by prowess of</a>
<a id='line_7820'>thy hands. Well, damosel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresomever ye</a>
<a id='line_7821'>go I will follow you. So this Beaumains rode with that lady till</a>
<a id='line_7822'>evensong time, and ever she chid him, and would not rest. And they came</a>
<a id='line_7823'>to a black laund; and there was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a</a>
<a id='line_7824'>black banner, and on the other side there hung a black shield, and by</a>
<a id='line_7825'>it stood a black spear great and long, and a great black horse covered</a>
<a id='line_7826'>with silk, and a black stone fast by.</a>
<a id='line_7827'></a>
<a id='line_7828'></a>
<a id='line_7829'></a>
<a id='line_7830'>CHAPTER VII. How Beaumains fought with the Knight of the Black Launds,</a>
<a id='line_7831'>and fought with him till he fell down and died.</a>
<a id='line_7832'></a>
<a id='line_7833'>There sat a knight all armed in black harness, and his name was the</a>
<a id='line_7834'>Knight of the Black Laund. Then the damosel, when she saw that knight,</a>
<a id='line_7835'>she bade him flee down that valley, for his horse was not saddled.</a>
<a id='line_7836'>Gramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward. With</a>
<a id='line_7837'>that the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said, Damosel,</a>
<a id='line_7838'>have ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion? Nay,</a>
<a id='line_7839'>fair knight, said she, this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in King</a>
<a id='line_7840'>Arthur’s kitchen for alms. Why cometh he, said the knight, in such</a>
<a id='line_7841'>array? it is shame that he beareth you company. Sir, I cannot be</a>
<a id='line_7842'>delivered of him, said she, for with me he rideth maugre mine head: God</a>
<a id='line_7843'>would that ye should put him from me, other to slay him an ye may, for</a>
<a id='line_7844'>he is an unhappy knave, and unhappily he hath done this day: through</a>
<a id='line_7845'>mishap I saw him slay two knights at the passage of the water; and</a>
<a id='line_7846'>other deeds he did before right marvellous and through unhappiness.</a>
<a id='line_7847'>That marvelleth me, said the Black Knight, that any man that is of</a>
<a id='line_7848'>worship will have ado with him. They know him not, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_7849'>and for because he rideth with me, they ween that he be some man of</a>
<a id='line_7850'>worship born. That may be, said the Black Knight; howbeit as ye say</a>
<a id='line_7851'>that he be no man of worship, he is a full likely person, and full like</a>
<a id='line_7852'>to be a strong man: but thus much shall I grant you, said the Black</a>
<a id='line_7853'>Knight; I shall put him down upon one foot, and his horse and his</a>
<a id='line_7854'>harness he shall leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any</a>
<a id='line_7855'>more harm.</a>
<a id='line_7856'></a>
<a id='line_7857'>When Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, Sir knight, thou art</a>
<a id='line_7858'>full large of my horse and my harness; I let thee wit it cost thee</a>
<a id='line_7859'>nought, and whether it liketh thee or not, this laund will I pass</a>
<a id='line_7860'>maugre thine head. And horse nor harness gettest thou none of mine, but</a>
<a id='line_7861'>if thou win them with thy hands; and therefore let see what thou canst</a>
<a id='line_7862'>do. Sayest thou that? said the Black Knight, now yield thy lady from</a>
<a id='line_7863'>thee, for it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a lady.</a>
<a id='line_7864'>Thou liest, said Beaumains, I am a gentleman born, and of more high</a>
<a id='line_7865'>lineage than thou, and that will I prove on thy body.</a>
<a id='line_7866'></a>
<a id='line_7867'>Then in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came together</a>
<a id='line_7868'>as it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight’s spear brake, and</a>
<a id='line_7869'>Beaumains thrust him through both his sides, and therewith his spear</a>
<a id='line_7870'>brake, and the truncheon left still in his side. But nevertheless the</a>
<a id='line_7871'>Black Knight drew his sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great</a>
<a id='line_7872'>might, and hurt Beaumains full sore. But at the last the Black Knight,</a>
<a id='line_7873'>within an hour and an half, he fell down off his horse in swoon, and</a>
<a id='line_7874'>there he died. And when Beaumains saw him so well horsed and armed,</a>
<a id='line_7875'>then he alighted down and armed him in his armour, and so took his</a>
<a id='line_7876'>horse and rode after the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_7877'></a>
<a id='line_7878'>When she saw him come nigh, she said, Away, kitchen knave, out of the</a>
<a id='line_7879'>wind, for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me. Alas, she said,</a>
<a id='line_7880'>that ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou</a>
<a id='line_7881'>hast done, but all this is thine unhappiness. But here by is one shall</a>
<a id='line_7882'>pay thee all thy payment, and therefore yet I counsel thee, flee. It</a>
<a id='line_7883'>may happen me, said Beaumains, to be beaten or slain, but I warn you,</a>
<a id='line_7884'>fair damosel, I will not flee away, a nor leave your company, for all</a>
<a id='line_7885'>that ye can say; for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat me, but</a>
<a id='line_7886'>howsomever it happeneth I escape, and they lie on the ground. And</a>
<a id='line_7887'>therefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all day</a>
<a id='line_7888'>rebuking me, for away will I not till I see the uttermost of this</a>
<a id='line_7889'>journey, or else I will be slain, other truly beaten; therefore ride on</a>
<a id='line_7890'>your way, for follow you I will whatsomever happen.</a>
<a id='line_7891'></a>
<a id='line_7892'></a>
<a id='line_7893'></a>
<a id='line_7894'>CHAPTER VIII. How the brother of the knight that was slain met with</a>
<a id='line_7895'>Beaumains, and fought with Beaumains till he was yielden.</a>
<a id='line_7896'></a>
<a id='line_7897'>Thus as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by them all</a>
<a id='line_7898'>in green, both his horse and his harness; and when he came nigh the</a>
<a id='line_7899'>damosel, he asked her, Is that my brother the Black Knight that ye have</a>
<a id='line_7900'>brought with you? Nay, nay, she said, this unhappy kitchen knave hath</a>
<a id='line_7901'>slain your brother through unhappiness. Alas, said the Green Knight,</a>
<a id='line_7902'>that is great pity, that so noble a knight as he was should so</a>
<a id='line_7903'>unhappily be slain, and namely of a knave’s hand, as ye say that he is.</a>
<a id='line_7904'>Ah! traitor, said the Green Knight, thou shalt die for slaying of my</a>
<a id='line_7905'>brother; he was a full noble knight, and his name was Sir Perard. I</a>
<a id='line_7906'>defy thee, said Beaumains, for I let thee wit I slew him knightly and</a>
<a id='line_7907'>not shamefully.</a>
<a id='line_7908'></a>
<a id='line_7909'>Therewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green, and it</a>
<a id='line_7910'>hung upon a thorn, and there he blew three deadly motes, and there came</a>
<a id='line_7911'>two damosels and armed him lightly. And then he took a great horse, and</a>
<a id='line_7912'>a green shield and a green spear. And then they ran together with all</a>
<a id='line_7913'>their mights, and brake their spears unto their hands. And then they</a>
<a id='line_7914'>drew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and either of them</a>
<a id='line_7915'>wounded other full ill. And at the last, at an overthwart, Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_7916'>with his horse struck the Green Knight’s horse upon the side, that he</a>
<a id='line_7917'>fell to the earth. And then the Green Knight avoided his horse lightly,</a>
<a id='line_7918'>and dressed him upon foot. That saw Beaumains, and therewithal he</a>
<a id='line_7919'>alighted, and they rushed together like two mighty kemps a long while,</a>
<a id='line_7920'>and sore they bled both. With that came the damosel, and said, My lord</a>
<a id='line_7921'>the Green Knight, why for shame stand ye so long fighting with the</a>
<a id='line_7922'>kitchen knave? Alas, it is shame that ever ye were made knight, to see</a>
<a id='line_7923'>such a lad to match such a knight, as the weed overgrew the corn.</a>
<a id='line_7924'>Therewith the Green Knight was ashamed, and therewithal he gave a great</a>
<a id='line_7925'>stroke of might, and clave his shield through. When Beaumains saw his</a>
<a id='line_7926'>shield cloven asunder he was a little ashamed of that stroke and of her</a>
<a id='line_7927'>language; and then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell</a>
<a id='line_7928'>on his knees. And so suddenly Beaumains pulled him upon the ground</a>
<a id='line_7929'>grovelling. And then the Green Knight cried him mercy, and yielded him</a>
<a id='line_7930'>unto Sir Beaumains, and prayed him to slay him not. All is in vain,</a>
<a id='line_7931'>said Beaumains, for thou shalt die but if this damosel that came with</a>
<a id='line_7932'>me pray me to save thy life. And therewithal he unlaced his helm like</a>
<a id='line_7933'>as he would slay him. Fie upon thee, false kitchen page, I will never</a>
<a id='line_7934'>pray thee to save his life, for I will never be so much in thy danger.</a>
<a id='line_7935'>Then shall he die, said Beaumains. Not so hardy, thou bawdy knave, said</a>
<a id='line_7936'>the damosel, that thou slay him. Alas, said the Green Knight, suffer me</a>
<a id='line_7937'>not to die for a fair word may save me. Fair knight, said the Green</a>
<a id='line_7938'>Knight, save my life, and I will forgive thee the death of my brother,</a>
<a id='line_7939'>and for ever to become thy man, and thirty knights that hold of me for</a>
<a id='line_7940'>ever shall do you service. In the devil’s name, said the damosel, that</a>
<a id='line_7941'>such a bawdy kitchen knave should have thee and thirty knights’</a>
<a id='line_7942'>service.</a>
<a id='line_7943'></a>
<a id='line_7944'>Sir knight, said Beaumains, all this availeth thee not, but if my</a>
<a id='line_7945'>damosel speak with me for thy life. And therewithal he made a semblant</a>
<a id='line_7946'>to slay him. Let be, said the damosel, thou bawdy knave; slay him not,</a>
<a id='line_7947'>for an thou do thou shalt repent it. Damosel, said Beaumains, your</a>
<a id='line_7948'>charge is to me a pleasure, and at your commandment his life shall be</a>
<a id='line_7949'>saved, and else not. Then he said, Sir knight with the green arms, I</a>
<a id='line_7950'>release thee quit at this damosel’s request, for I will not make her</a>
<a id='line_7951'>wroth, I will fulfil all that she chargeth me. And then the Green</a>
<a id='line_7952'>Knight kneeled down, and did him homage with his sword. Then said the</a>
<a id='line_7953'>damosel, Me repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage, and of your</a>
<a id='line_7954'>brother’s death, the Black Knight, for of your help I had great mister,</a>
<a id='line_7955'>for I dread me sore to pass this forest. Nay, dread you not, said the</a>
<a id='line_7956'>Green Knight, for ye shall lodge with me this night, and to-morn I</a>
<a id='line_7957'>shall help you through this forest. So they took their horses and rode</a>
<a id='line_7958'>to his manor, which was fast there beside.</a>
<a id='line_7959'></a>
<a id='line_7960'></a>
<a id='line_7961'></a>
<a id='line_7962'>CHAPTER IX. How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not</a>
<a id='line_7963'>suffer him to sit at her table, but called him kitchen boy.</a>
<a id='line_7964'></a>
<a id='line_7965'>And ever she rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him to sit at her</a>
<a id='line_7966'>table, but as the Green Knight took him and sat him at a side table.</a>
<a id='line_7967'>Marvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the damosel, why ye rebuke</a>
<a id='line_7968'>this noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damosel, he is a full noble</a>
<a id='line_7969'>knight, and I know no knight is able to match him; therefore ye do</a>
<a id='line_7970'>great wrong to rebuke him, for he shall do you right good service, for</a>
<a id='line_7971'>whatsomever he maketh himself, ye shall prove at the end that he is</a>
<a id='line_7972'>come of a noble blood and of king’s lineage. Fie, fie, said the</a>
<a id='line_7973'>damosel, it is shame for you to say of him such worship. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_7974'>the Green Knight, it were shame for me to say of him any disworship,</a>
<a id='line_7975'>for he hath proved himself a better knight than I am, yet have I met</a>
<a id='line_7976'>with many knights in my days, and never or this time have I found no</a>
<a id='line_7977'>knight his match. And so that night they yede unto rest, and all that</a>
<a id='line_7978'>night the Green Knight commanded thirty knights privily to watch</a>
<a id='line_7979'>Beaumains, for to keep him from all treason.</a>
<a id='line_7980'></a>
<a id='line_7981'>And so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake their</a>
<a id='line_7982'>fast; and then they took their horses and rode on their way, and the</a>
<a id='line_7983'>Green Knight conveyed them through the forest; and there the Green</a>
<a id='line_7984'>Knight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these thirty knights shall be</a>
<a id='line_7985'>always at your summons, both early and late, at your calling and</a>
<a id='line_7986'>whither that ever ye will send us. It is well said, said Beaumains;</a>
<a id='line_7987'>when that I call upon you ye must yield you unto King Arthur, and all</a>
<a id='line_7988'>your knights. If that ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times,</a>
<a id='line_7989'>said the Green Knight. Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil’s name, said</a>
<a id='line_7990'>the damosel, that any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen</a>
<a id='line_7991'>knave. So then departed the Green Knight and the damosel. And then she</a>
<a id='line_7992'>said unto Beaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen boy? Cast away</a>
<a id='line_7993'>thy shield and thy spear, and flee away; yet I counsel thee betimes or</a>
<a id='line_7994'>thou shalt say right soon, alas; for wert thou as wight as ever was</a>
<a id='line_7995'>Wade or Launcelot, Tristram, or the good knight Sir Lamorak, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_7996'>not pass a pass here that is called the Pass Perilous. Damosel, said</a>
<a id='line_7997'>Beaumains, who is afeard let him flee, for it were shame to turn again</a>
<a id='line_7998'>sithen I have ridden so long with you. Well, said the damosel, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_7999'>soon, whether ye will or not.</a>
<a id='line_8000'></a>
<a id='line_8001'></a>
<a id='line_8002'></a>
<a id='line_8003'>CHAPTER X. How the third brother, called the Red Knight, jousted and</a>
<a id='line_8004'>fought against Beaumains, and how Beaumains overcame him.</a>
<a id='line_8005'></a>
<a id='line_8006'>So within a while they saw a tower as white as any snow, well</a>
<a id='line_8007'>matchecold all about, and double dyked. And over the tower gate there</a>
<a id='line_8008'>hung a fifty shields of divers colours, and under that tower there was</a>
<a id='line_8009'>a fair meadow. And therein were many knights and squires to behold,</a>
<a id='line_8010'>scaffolds and pavilions; for there upon the morn should be a great</a>
<a id='line_8011'>tournament: and the lord of the tower was in his castle and looked out</a>
<a id='line_8012'>at a window, and saw a damosel, a dwarf, and a knight armed at all</a>
<a id='line_8013'>points. So God me help, said the lord, with that knight will I joust,</a>
<a id='line_8014'>for I see that he is a knight-errant. And so he armed him and horsed</a>
<a id='line_8015'>him hastily. And when he was on horseback with his shield and his</a>
<a id='line_8016'>spear, it was all red, both his horse and his harness, and all that to</a>
<a id='line_8017'>him longeth. And when that he came nigh him he weened it had been his</a>
<a id='line_8018'>brother the Black Knight; and then he cried aloud, Brother, what do ye</a>
<a id='line_8019'>in these marches? Nay, nay, said the damosel, it is not he; this is but</a>
<a id='line_8020'>a kitchen knave that was brought up for alms in King Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_8021'>Nevertheless, said the Red Knight, I will speak with him or he depart.</a>
<a id='line_8022'>Ah, said the damosel, this knave hath killed thy brother, and Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_8023'>named him Beaumains, and this horse and this harness was thy brother’s,</a>
<a id='line_8024'>the Black Knight. Also I saw thy brother the Green Knight overcome of</a>
<a id='line_8025'>his hands. Now may ye be revenged upon him, for I may never be quit of</a>
<a id='line_8026'>him.</a>
<a id='line_8027'></a>
<a id='line_8028'>With this either knights departed in sunder, and they came together</a>
<a id='line_8029'>with all their might, and either of their horses fell to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_8030'>they avoided their horses, and put their shields afore them and drew</a>
<a id='line_8031'>their swords, and either gave other sad strokes, now here, now there,</a>
<a id='line_8032'>rasing, tracing, foining, and hurling like two boars, the space of two</a>
<a id='line_8033'>hours. And then she cried on high to the Red Knight, Alas, thou noble</a>
<a id='line_8034'>Red Knight, think what worship hath followed thee, let never a kitchen</a>
<a id='line_8035'>knave endure thee so long as he doth. Then the Red Knight waxed wroth</a>
<a id='line_8036'>and doubled his strokes, and hurt Beaumains wonderly sore, that the</a>
<a id='line_8037'>blood ran down to the ground, that it was wonder to see that strong</a>
<a id='line_8038'>battle. Yet at the last Sir Beaumains struck him to the earth, and as</a>
<a id='line_8039'>he would have slain the Red Knight, he cried mercy, saying, Noble</a>
<a id='line_8040'>knight, slay me not, and I shall yield me to thee with fifty knights</a>
<a id='line_8041'>with me that be at my commandment. And I forgive thee all the despite</a>
<a id='line_8042'>that thou hast done to me, and the death of my brother the Black</a>
<a id='line_8043'>Knight. All this availeth not, said Beaumains, but if my damosel pray</a>
<a id='line_8044'>me to save thy life. And therewith he made semblant to strike off his</a>
<a id='line_8045'>head. Let be, thou Beaumains, slay him not, for he is a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_8046'>and not so hardy, upon thine head, but thou save him.</a>
<a id='line_8047'></a>
<a id='line_8048'>Then Beaumains bade the Red Knight, Stand up, and thank the damosel now</a>
<a id='line_8049'>of thy life. Then the Red Knight prayed him to see his castle, and to</a>
<a id='line_8050'>be there all night. So the damosel then granted him, and there they had</a>
<a id='line_8051'>merry cheer. But always the damosel spake many foul words unto</a>
<a id='line_8052'>Beaumains, whereof the Red Knight had great marvel; and all that night</a>
<a id='line_8053'>the Red Knight made three score knights to watch Beaumains, that he</a>
<a id='line_8054'>should have no shame nor villainy. And upon the morn they heard mass</a>
<a id='line_8055'>and dined, and the Red Knight came before Beaumains with his three</a>
<a id='line_8056'>score knights, and there he proffered him his homage and fealty at all</a>
<a id='line_8057'>times, he and his knights to do him service. I thank you, said</a>
<a id='line_8058'>Beaumains, but this ye shall grant me: when I call upon you, to come</a>
<a id='line_8059'>afore my lord King Arthur, and yield you unto him to be his knights.</a>
<a id='line_8060'>Sir, said the Red Knight, I will be ready, and my fellowship, at your</a>
<a id='line_8061'>summons. So Sir Beaumains departed and the damosel, and ever she rode</a>
<a id='line_8062'>chiding him in the foulest manner.</a>
<a id='line_8063'></a>
<a id='line_8064'></a>
<a id='line_8065'></a>
<a id='line_8066'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>and he suffered it patiently.</a>
<a id='line_8068'></a>
<a id='line_8069'>Damosel, said Beaumains, ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye do,</a>
<a id='line_8070'>for meseemeth I have done you good service, and ever ye threaten me I</a>
<a id='line_8071'>shall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever for all your boast</a>
<a id='line_8072'>they lie in the dust or in the mire, and therefore I pray you rebuke me</a>
<a id='line_8073'>no more; and when ye see me beaten or yielden as recreant, then may ye</a>
<a id='line_8074'>bid me go from you shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not</a>
<a id='line_8075'>depart from you, for I were worse than a fool an I would depart from</a>
<a id='line_8076'>you all the while that I win worship. Well, said she, right soon there</a>
<a id='line_8077'>shall meet a knight shall pay thee all thy wages, for he is the most</a>
<a id='line_8078'>man of worship of the world, except King Arthur. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_8079'>Beaumains, the more he is of worship, the more shall be my worship to</a>
<a id='line_8080'>have ado with him.</a>
<a id='line_8081'></a>
<a id='line_8082'>Then anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and fair. And</a>
<a id='line_8083'>betwixt them and the city a mile and an half there was a fair meadow</a>
<a id='line_8084'>that seemed new mown, and therein were many pavilions fair to behold.</a>
<a id='line_8085'>Lo, said the damosel, yonder is a lord that owneth yonder city, and his</a>
<a id='line_8086'>custom is, when the weather is fair, to lie in this meadow to joust and</a>
<a id='line_8087'>tourney. And ever there be about him five hundred knights and gentlemen</a>
<a id='line_8088'>of arms, and there be all manner of games that any gentleman can</a>
<a id='line_8089'>devise. That goodly lord, said Beaumains, would I fain see. Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_8090'>see him time enough, said the damosel, and so as she rode near she</a>
<a id='line_8091'>espied the pavilion where he was. Lo, said she, seest thou yonder</a>
<a id='line_8092'>pavilion that is all of the colour of Inde, and all manner of thing</a>
<a id='line_8093'>that there is about, men and women, and horses trapped, shields and</a>
<a id='line_8094'>spears were all of the colour of Inde, and his name is Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_8095'>Inde, the most lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst on. It may well</a>
<a id='line_8096'>be, said Beaumains, but be he never so stout a knight, in this field I</a>
<a id='line_8097'>shall abide till that I see him under his shield. Ah, fool, said she,</a>
<a id='line_8098'>thou wert better flee betimes. Why, said Beaumains, an he be such a</a>
<a id='line_8099'>knight as ye make him, he will not set upon me with all his men, or</a>
<a id='line_8100'>with his five hundred knights. For an there come no more but one at</a>
<a id='line_8101'>once, I shall him not fail whilst my life lasteth. Fie, fie, said the</a>
<a id='line_8102'>damosel, that ever such a stinking knave should blow such a boast.</a>
<a id='line_8103'>Damosel, he said, ye are to blame so to rebuke me, for I had liefer do</a>
<a id='line_8104'>five battles than so to be rebuked, let him come and then let him do</a>
<a id='line_8105'>his worst.</a>
<a id='line_8106'></a>
<a id='line_8107'>Sir, she said, I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art come;</a>
<a id='line_8108'>boldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen;</a>
<a id='line_8109'>therefore I pray thee save thyself an thou mayest, for thy horse and</a>
<a id='line_8110'>thou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell over long from the</a>
<a id='line_8111'>siege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all perilous passages we are</a>
<a id='line_8112'>passed save all only this passage; and here I dread me sore lest ye</a>
<a id='line_8113'>shall catch some hurt, therefore I would ye were hence, that ye were</a>
<a id='line_8114'>not bruised nor hurt with this strong knight. But I let you wit that</a>
<a id='line_8115'>Sir Persant of Inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the knight</a>
<a id='line_8116'>that laid the siege about my lady. As for that, said Sir Beaumains, be</a>
<a id='line_8117'>it as it be may. For sithen I am come so nigh this knight I will prove</a>
<a id='line_8118'>his might or I depart from him, and else I shall be shamed an I now</a>
<a id='line_8119'>withdraw me from him. And therefore, damosel, have ye no doubt by the</a>
<a id='line_8120'>grace of God I shall so deal with this knight that within two hours</a>
<a id='line_8121'>after noon I shall deliver him. And then shall we come to the siege by</a>
<a id='line_8122'>daylight. O Jesu, marvel have I, said the damosel, what manner a man ye</a>
<a id='line_8123'>be, for it may never be otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood,</a>
<a id='line_8124'>for so foul nor shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done</a>
<a id='line_8125'>you, and ever courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but</a>
<a id='line_8126'>of a gentle blood.</a>
<a id='line_8127'></a>
<a id='line_8128'>Damosel, said Beaumains, a knight may little do that may not suffer a</a>
<a id='line_8129'>damosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none heed to your</a>
<a id='line_8130'>words, for the more ye said the more ye angered me, and my wrath I</a>
<a id='line_8131'>wreaked upon them that I had ado withal. And therefore all the</a>
<a id='line_8132'>missaying that ye missaid me furthered me in my battle, and caused me</a>
<a id='line_8133'>to think to show and prove myself at the end what I was; for</a>
<a id='line_8134'>peradventure though I had meat in King Arthur’s kitchen, yet I might</a>
<a id='line_8135'>have had meat enough in other places, but all that I did it for to</a>
<a id='line_8136'>prove and assay my friends, and that shall be known another day; and</a>
<a id='line_8137'>whether that I be a gentleman born or none, I let you wit, fair</a>
<a id='line_8138'>damosel, I have done you gentleman’s service, and peradventure better</a>
<a id='line_8139'>service yet will I do or I depart from you. Alas, she said, fair</a>
<a id='line_8140'>Beaumains, forgive me all that I have missaid or done against thee.</a>
<a id='line_8141'>With all my heart, said he, I forgive it you, for ye did nothing but as</a>
<a id='line_8142'>ye should do, for all your evil words pleased me; and damosel, said</a>
<a id='line_8143'>Beaumains, since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me, wit ye well it</a>
<a id='line_8144'>gladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is no knight living</a>
<a id='line_8145'>but I am able enough for him.</a>
<a id='line_8146'></a>
<a id='line_8147'></a>
<a id='line_8148'></a>
<a id='line_8149'>CHAPTER XII. How Beaumains fought with Sir Persant of Inde, and made</a>
<a id='line_8150'>him to be yielden.</a>
<a id='line_8151'></a>
<a id='line_8152'>With this Sir Persant of Inde had espied them as they hoved in the</a>
<a id='line_8153'>field, and knightly he sent to them whether he came in war or in peace.</a>
<a id='line_8154'>Say to thy lord, said Beaumains, I take no force, but whether as him</a>
<a id='line_8155'>list himself. So the messenger went again unto Sir Persant and told him</a>
<a id='line_8156'>all his answer. Well then will I have ado with him to the utterance,</a>
<a id='line_8157'>and so he purveyed him and rode against him. And Beaumains saw him and</a>
<a id='line_8158'>made him ready, and there they met with all that ever their horses</a>
<a id='line_8159'>might run, and brast their spears either in three pieces, and their</a>
<a id='line_8160'>horses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the</a>
<a id='line_8161'>earth; and lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields</a>
<a id='line_8162'>afore them, and drew their swords, and gave many great strokes that</a>
<a id='line_8163'>sometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8164'>Thus they fought two hours and more, that their shields and their</a>
<a id='line_8165'>hauberks were all forhewen, and in many steads they were wounded. So at</a>
<a id='line_8166'>the last Sir Beaumains smote him through the cost of the body, and then</a>
<a id='line_8167'>he retrayed him here and there, and knightly maintained his battle long</a>
<a id='line_8168'>time. And at the last, though him loath were, Beaumains smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_8169'>Persant above upon the helm, that he fell grovelling to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_8170'>then he leapt upon him overthwart and unlaced his helm to have slain</a>
<a id='line_8171'>him.</a>
<a id='line_8172'></a>
<a id='line_8173'>Then Sir Persant yielded him and asked him mercy. With that came the</a>
<a id='line_8174'>damosel and prayed to save his life. I will well, for it were pity this</a>
<a id='line_8175'>noble knight should die. Gramercy, said Persant, gentle knight and</a>
<a id='line_8176'>damosel. For certainly now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother</a>
<a id='line_8177'>the Black Knight at the black thorn; he was a full noble knight, his</a>
<a id='line_8178'>name was Sir Percard. Also I am sure that ye are he that won mine other</a>
<a id='line_8179'>brother the Green Knight, his name was Sir Pertolepe. Also ye won my</a>
<a id='line_8180'>brother the Red Knight, Sir Perimones. And now since ye have won these,</a>
<a id='line_8181'>this shall I do for to please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of</a>
<a id='line_8182'>me, and an hundred knights to be always at your commandment, to go and</a>
<a id='line_8183'>ride where ye will command us. And so they went unto Sir Persant’s</a>
<a id='line_8184'>pavilion and drank the wine, and ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant</a>
<a id='line_8185'>made him to rest upon a bed until supper time, and after supper to bed</a>
<a id='line_8186'>again. When Beaumains was abed, Sir Persant had a lady, a fair daughter</a>
<a id='line_8187'>of eighteen year of age, and there he called her unto him, and charged</a>
<a id='line_8188'>her and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the knight’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_8189'>and lie down by his side, and make him no strange cheer, but good</a>
<a id='line_8190'>cheer, and take him in thine arms and kiss him, and look that this be</a>
<a id='line_8191'>done, I charge you, as ye will have my love and my good will. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_8192'>Persant’s daughter did as her father bade her, and so she went unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_8193'>Beaumains’ bed, and privily she dispoiled her, and laid her down by</a>
<a id='line_8194'>him, and then he awoke and saw her, and asked her what she was. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_8195'>she said, I am Sir Persant’s daughter, that by the commandment of my</a>
<a id='line_8196'>father am come hither. Be ye a maid or a wife? said he. Sir, she said,</a>
<a id='line_8197'>I am a clean maiden. God defend, said he, that I should defoil you to</a>
<a id='line_8198'>do Sir Persant such a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this</a>
<a id='line_8199'>bed or else I will. Sir, she said, I came not to you by mine own will,</a>
<a id='line_8200'>but as I was commanded. Alas, said Sir Beaumains, I were a shameful</a>
<a id='line_8201'>knight an I would do your father any disworship; and so he kissed her,</a>
<a id='line_8202'>and so she departed and came unto Sir Persant her father, and told him</a>
<a id='line_8203'>all how she had sped. Truly, said Sir Persant, whatsomever he be, he is</a>
<a id='line_8204'>come of a noble blood. And so we leave them there till on the morn.</a>
<a id='line_8205'></a>
<a id='line_8206'></a>
<a id='line_8207'></a>
<a id='line_8208'>CHAPTER XIII. Of the goodly communication between Sir Persant and</a>
<a id='line_8209'>Beaumains, and how he told him that his name was Sir Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_8210'></a>
<a id='line_8211'>And so on the morn the damosel and Sir Beaumains heard mass and brake</a>
<a id='line_8212'>their fast, and so took their leave. Fair damosel, said Persant,</a>
<a id='line_8213'>whitherward are ye way-leading this knight? Sir, she said, this knight</a>
<a id='line_8214'>is going to the siege that besiegeth my sister in the Castle Dangerous.</a>
<a id='line_8215'>Ah, ah, said Persant, that is the Knight of the Red Laund, the which is</a>
<a id='line_8216'>the most perilous knight that I know now living, and a man that is</a>
<a id='line_8217'>without mercy, and men say that he hath seven men’s strength. God save</a>
<a id='line_8218'>you, said he to Beaumains, from that knight, for he doth great wrong to</a>
<a id='line_8219'>that lady, and that is great pity, for she is one of the fairest ladies</a>
<a id='line_8220'>of the world, and meseemeth that your damosel is her sister: is not</a>
<a id='line_8221'>your name Linet? said he. Yea, sir, said she, and my lady my sister’s</a>
<a id='line_8222'>name is Dame Lionesse. Now shall I tell you, said Sir Persant, this Red</a>
<a id='line_8223'>Knight of the Red Laund hath lain long at the siege, well-nigh this two</a>
<a id='line_8224'>years, and many times he might have had her an he had would, but he</a>
<a id='line_8225'>prolongeth the time to this intent, for to have Sir Launcelot du Lake</a>
<a id='line_8226'>to do battle with him, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, or Sir</a>
<a id='line_8227'>Gawaine, and this is his tarrying so long at the siege.</a>
<a id='line_8228'></a>
<a id='line_8229'>Now my lord Sir Persant of Inde, said the damosel Linet, I require you</a>
<a id='line_8230'>that ye will make this gentleman knight or ever he fight with the Red</a>
<a id='line_8231'>Knight. I will with all my heart, said Sir Persant, an it please him to</a>
<a id='line_8232'>take the order of knighthood of so simple a man as I am. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8233'>Beaumains, I thank you for your good will, for I am better sped, for</a>
<a id='line_8234'>certainly the noble knight Sir Launcelot made me knight. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8235'>Persant, of a more renowned knight might ye not be made knight; for of</a>
<a id='line_8236'>all knights he may be called chief of knighthood; and so all the world</a>
<a id='line_8237'>saith, that betwixt three knights is departed clearly knighthood, that</a>
<a id='line_8238'>is Launcelot du Lake, Sir Tristram de Liones, and Sir Lamorak de Galis:</a>
<a id='line_8239'>these bear now the renown. There be many other knights, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_8240'>Palamides the Saracen and Sir Safere his brother; also Sir Bleoberis</a>
<a id='line_8241'>and Sir Blamore de Ganis his brother; also Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8242'>Ector de Maris and Sir Percivale de Galis; these and many more be noble</a>
<a id='line_8243'>knights, but there be none that pass the three above said; therefore</a>
<a id='line_8244'>God speed you well, said Sir Persant, for an ye may match the Red</a>
<a id='line_8245'>Knight ye shall be called the fourth of the world.</a>
<a id='line_8246'></a>
<a id='line_8247'>Sir, said Beaumains, I would fain be of good fame and of knighthood.</a>
<a id='line_8248'>And I let you wit I came of good men, for I dare say my father was a</a>
<a id='line_8249'>noble man, and so that ye will keep it in close, and this damosel, I</a>
<a id='line_8250'>will tell you of what kin I am. We will not discover you, said they</a>
<a id='line_8251'>both, till ye command us, by the faith we owe unto God. Truly then,</a>
<a id='line_8252'>said he, my name is Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, and</a>
<a id='line_8253'>my mother is King Arthur’s sister, her name is Dame Morgawse, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8254'>Gawaine is my brother, and Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and I am the</a>
<a id='line_8255'>youngest of them all. And yet wot not King Arthur nor Sir Gawaine what</a>
<a id='line_8256'>I am.</a>
<a id='line_8257'></a>
<a id='line_8258'></a>
<a id='line_8259'></a>
<a id='line_8260'>CHAPTER XIV. How the lady that was besieged had word from her sister</a>
<a id='line_8261'>how she had brought a knight to fight for her, and what battles he had</a>
<a id='line_8262'>achieved.</a>
<a id='line_8263'></a>
<a id='line_8264'>So the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her</a>
<a id='line_8265'>sister’s coming by the dwarf, and a knight with her, and how he had</a>
<a id='line_8266'>passed all the perilous passages. What manner a man is he? said the</a>
<a id='line_8267'>lady. He is a noble knight, truly, madam, said the dwarf, and but a</a>
<a id='line_8268'>young man, but he is as likely a man as ever ye saw any. What is he?</a>
<a id='line_8269'>said the damosel, and of what kin is he come, and of whom was he made</a>
<a id='line_8270'>knight? Madam, said the dwarf, he is the king’s son of Orkney, but his</a>
<a id='line_8271'>name I will not tell you as at this time; but wit ye well, of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8272'>Launcelot was he made knight, for of none other would he be made</a>
<a id='line_8273'>knight, and Sir Kay named him Beaumains. How escaped he, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_8274'>from the brethren of Persant? Madam, he said, as a noble knight should.</a>
<a id='line_8275'>First, he slew two brethren at a passage of a water. Ah! said she, they</a>
<a id='line_8276'>were good knights, but they were murderers, the one hight Gherard le</a>
<a id='line_8277'>Breuse, and the other knight hight Sir Arnold le Breuse. Then, madam,</a>
<a id='line_8278'>he recountered with the Black Knight, and slew him in plain battle, and</a>
<a id='line_8279'>so he took his horse and his armour and fought with the Green Knight</a>
<a id='line_8280'>and won him in plain battle, and in like wise he served the Red Knight,</a>
<a id='line_8281'>and after in the same wise he served the Blue Knight and won him in</a>
<a id='line_8282'>plain battle. Then, said the lady, he hath overcome Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_8283'>Inde, one of the noblest knights of the world, and the dwarf said, He</a>
<a id='line_8284'>hath won all the four brethren and slain the Black Knight, and yet he</a>
<a id='line_8285'>did more to-fore: he overthrew Sir Kay and left him nigh dead upon the</a>
<a id='line_8286'>ground; also he did a great battle with Sir Launcelot, and there they</a>
<a id='line_8287'>departed on even hands: and then Sir Launcelot made him knight.</a>
<a id='line_8288'></a>
<a id='line_8289'>Dwarf, said the lady, I am glad of these tidings, therefore go thou in</a>
<a id='line_8290'>an hermitage of mine hereby, and there shalt thou bear with thee of my</a>
<a id='line_8291'>wine in two flagons of silver, they are of two gallons, and also two</a>
<a id='line_8292'>cast of bread with fat venison baked, and dainty fowls; and a cup of</a>
<a id='line_8293'>gold here I deliver thee, that is rich and precious; and bear all this</a>
<a id='line_8294'>to mine hermitage, and put it in the hermit’s hands. And sithen go thou</a>
<a id='line_8295'>unto my sister and greet her well, and commend me unto that gentle</a>
<a id='line_8296'>knight, and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong, and say</a>
<a id='line_8297'>ye him I thank him of his courtesy and goodness, that he would take</a>
<a id='line_8298'>upon him such labour for me that never did him bounty nor courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_8299'>Also pray him that he be of good heart and courage, for he shall meet</a>
<a id='line_8300'>with a full noble knight, but he is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor</a>
<a id='line_8301'>gentleness; for he attendeth unto nothing but to murder, and that is</a>
<a id='line_8302'>the cause I cannot praise him nor love him.</a>
<a id='line_8303'></a>
<a id='line_8304'>So this dwarf departed, and came to Sir Persant, where he found the</a>
<a id='line_8305'>damosel Linet and Sir Beaumains, and there he told them all as ye have</a>
<a id='line_8306'>heard; and then they took their leave, but Sir Persant took an ambling</a>
<a id='line_8307'>hackney and conveyed them on their ways, and then beleft them to God;</a>
<a id='line_8308'>and so within a little while they came to that hermitage, and there</a>
<a id='line_8309'>they drank the wine, and ate the venison and the fowls baken. And so</a>
<a id='line_8310'>when they had repasted them well, the dwarf returned again with his</a>
<a id='line_8311'>vessel unto the castle again; and there met with him the Red Knight of</a>
<a id='line_8312'>the Red Launds, and asked him from whence that he came, and where he</a>
<a id='line_8313'>had been. Sir, said the dwarf, I have been with my lady’s sister of</a>
<a id='line_8314'>this castle, and she hath been at King Arthur’s court, and brought a</a>
<a id='line_8315'>knight with her. Then I account her travail but lost; for though she</a>
<a id='line_8316'>had brought with her Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Lamorak, or Sir</a>
<a id='line_8317'>Gawaine, I would think myself good enough for them all.</a>
<a id='line_8318'></a>
<a id='line_8319'>It may well be, said the dwarf, but this knight hath passed all the</a>
<a id='line_8320'>perilous passages, and slain the Black Knight and other two more, and</a>
<a id='line_8321'>won the Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight. Then is he</a>
<a id='line_8322'>one of these four that I have afore rehearsed. He is none of those,</a>
<a id='line_8323'>said the dwarf, but he is a king’s son. What is his name? said the Red</a>
<a id='line_8324'>Knight of the Red Launds. That will I not tell you, said the dwarf, but</a>
<a id='line_8325'>Sir Kay upon scorn named him Beaumains. I care not, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_8326'>what knight so ever he be, for I shall soon deliver him. And if I ever</a>
<a id='line_8327'>match him he shall have a shameful death as many other have had. That</a>
<a id='line_8328'>were pity, said the dwarf, and it is marvel that ye make such shameful</a>
<a id='line_8329'>war upon noble knights.</a>
<a id='line_8330'></a>
<a id='line_8331'></a>
<a id='line_8332'></a>
<a id='line_8333'>CHAPTER XV. How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege; and came</a>
<a id='line_8334'>to a sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew a horn, and then the</a>
<a id='line_8335'>Knight of the Red Launds came to fight with him.</a>
<a id='line_8336'></a>
<a id='line_8337'>Now leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains, that</a>
<a id='line_8338'>all night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he and the damosel</a>
<a id='line_8339'>Linet heard their mass and brake their fast. And then they took their</a>
<a id='line_8340'>horses and rode throughout a fair forest; and then they came to a</a>
<a id='line_8341'>plain, and saw where were many pavilions and tents, and a fair castle,</a>
<a id='line_8342'>and there was much smoke and great noise; and when they came near the</a>
<a id='line_8343'>siege Sir Beaumains espied upon great trees, as he rode, how there hung</a>
<a id='line_8344'>full goodly armed knights by the neck, and their shields about their</a>
<a id='line_8345'>necks with their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there</a>
<a id='line_8346'>hung nigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms.</a>
<a id='line_8347'></a>
<a id='line_8348'>Then Sir Beaumains abated his countenance and said, What meaneth this?</a>
<a id='line_8349'>Fair sir, said the damosel, abate not your cheer for all this sight,</a>
<a id='line_8350'>for ye must courage yourself, or else ye be all shent, for all these</a>
<a id='line_8351'>knights came hither to this siege to rescue my sister Dame Lionesse,</a>
<a id='line_8352'>and when the Red Knight of the Red Launds had overcome them, he put</a>
<a id='line_8353'>them to this shameful death without mercy and pity. And in the same</a>
<a id='line_8354'>wise he will serve you but if you quit you the better.</a>
<a id='line_8355'></a>
<a id='line_8356'>Now Jesu defend me, said Beaumains, from such a villainous death and</a>
<a id='line_8357'>shenship of arms. For rather than I should so be faren withal, I would</a>
<a id='line_8358'>rather be slain manly in plain battle. So were ye better, said the</a>
<a id='line_8359'>damosel; for trust not, in him is no courtesy, but all goeth to the</a>
<a id='line_8360'>death or shameful murder, and that is pity, for he is a full likely</a>
<a id='line_8361'>man, well made of body, and a full noble knight of prowess, and a lord</a>
<a id='line_8362'>of great lands and possessions. Truly, said Beaumains, he may well be a</a>
<a id='line_8363'>good knight, but he useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he</a>
<a id='line_8364'>endureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_8365'>have not dealt with him.</a>
<a id='line_8366'></a>
<a id='line_8367'>And then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with full</a>
<a id='line_8368'>warlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls;</a>
<a id='line_8369'>and there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beat upon the one</a>
<a id='line_8370'>side of the walls, where were many ships and mariners’ noise with “hale</a>
<a id='line_8371'>and how.” And also there was fast by a sycamore tree, and there hung an</a>
<a id='line_8372'>horn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant’s bone; and this</a>
<a id='line_8373'>Knight of the Red Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any</a>
<a id='line_8374'>errant-knight, he must blow that horn, and then will he make him ready</a>
<a id='line_8375'>and come to him to do battle. But, sir, I pray you, said the damosel</a>
<a id='line_8376'>Linet, blow ye not the horn till it be high noon, for now it is about</a>
<a id='line_8377'>prime, and now increaseth his might, that as men say he hath seven</a>
<a id='line_8378'>men’s strength. Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel, say ye never so more</a>
<a id='line_8379'>to me; for, an he were as good a knight as ever was, I shall never fail</a>
<a id='line_8380'>him in his most might, for either I will win worship worshipfully, or</a>
<a id='line_8381'>die knightly in the field. And therewith he spurred his horse straight</a>
<a id='line_8382'>to the sycamore tree, and blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege</a>
<a id='line_8383'>and the castle rang thereof. And then there leapt out knights out of</a>
<a id='line_8384'>their tents and pavilions, and they within the castle looked over the</a>
<a id='line_8385'>walls and out at windows.</a>
<a id='line_8386'></a>
<a id='line_8387'>Then the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him hastily, and two barons</a>
<a id='line_8388'>set on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red, his armour,</a>
<a id='line_8389'>spear and shield. And an earl buckled his helm upon his head, and then</a>
<a id='line_8390'>they brought him a red spear and a red steed, and so he rode into a</a>
<a id='line_8391'>little vale under the castle, that all that were in the castle and at</a>
<a id='line_8392'>the siege might behold the battle.</a>
<a id='line_8393'></a>
<a id='line_8394'></a>
<a id='line_8395'></a>
<a id='line_8396'>CHAPTER XVI. How the two knights met together, and of their talking,</a>
<a id='line_8397'>and how they began their battle.</a>
<a id='line_8398'></a>
<a id='line_8399'>Sir, said the damosel Linet unto Sir Beaumains, look ye be glad and</a>
<a id='line_8400'>light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my</a>
<a id='line_8401'>lady, my sister, Dame Lionesse. Where? said Beaumains. Yonder, said the</a>
<a id='line_8402'>damosel, and pointed with her finger. That is truth, said Beaumains.</a>
<a id='line_8403'>She beseemeth afar the fairest lady that ever I looked upon; and truly,</a>
<a id='line_8404'>he said, I ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle, for truly</a>
<a id='line_8405'>she shall be my lady, and for her I will fight. And ever he looked up</a>
<a id='line_8406'>to the window with glad countenance, and the Lady Lionesse made curtsey</a>
<a id='line_8407'>to him down to the earth, with holding up both their hands.</a>
<a id='line_8408'></a>
<a id='line_8409'>With that the Red Knight of the Red Launds called to Sir Beaumains,</a>
<a id='line_8410'>Leave, sir knight, thy looking, and behold me, I counsel thee; for I</a>
<a id='line_8411'>warn thee well she is my lady, and for her I have done many strong</a>
<a id='line_8412'>battles. If thou have so done, said Beaumains, meseemeth it was but</a>
<a id='line_8413'>waste labour, for she loveth none of thy fellowship, and thou to love</a>
<a id='line_8414'>that loveth not thee is but great folly. For an I understood that she</a>
<a id='line_8415'>were not glad of my coming, I would be advised or I did battle for her.</a>
<a id='line_8416'>But I understand by the besieging of this castle she may forbear thy</a>
<a id='line_8417'>fellowship. And therefore wit thou well, thou Red Knight of the Red</a>
<a id='line_8418'>Launds, I love her, and will rescue her, or else to die. Sayst thou</a>
<a id='line_8419'>that? said the Red Knight, meseemeth thou ought of reason to be ware by</a>
<a id='line_8420'>yonder knights that thou sawest hang upon yonder trees. Fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_8421'>said Beaumains, that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil, for in that</a>
<a id='line_8422'>thou shamest thyself and knighthood, and thou mayst be sure there will</a>
<a id='line_8423'>no lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked customs. And now thou weenest</a>
<a id='line_8424'>that the sight of these hanged knights should fear me. Nay truly, not</a>
<a id='line_8425'>so; that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness</a>
<a id='line_8426'>against thee, more than I would have had against thee an thou wert a</a>
<a id='line_8427'>well-ruled knight. Make thee ready, said the Red Knight of the Red</a>
<a id='line_8428'>Launds, and talk no longer with me.</a>
<a id='line_8429'></a>
<a id='line_8430'>Then Sir Beaumains bade the damosel go from him; and then they put</a>
<a id='line_8431'>their spears in their rests, and came together with all their might</a>
<a id='line_8432'>that they had both, and either smote other in midst of their shields</a>
<a id='line_8433'>that the paitrelles, surcingles, and cruppers brast, and fell to the</a>
<a id='line_8434'>earth both, and the reins of their bridles in their hands; and so they</a>
<a id='line_8435'>lay a great while sore astonied, that all that were in the castle and</a>
<a id='line_8436'>in the siege weened their necks had been broken; and then many a</a>
<a id='line_8437'>stranger and other said the strange knight was a big man, and a noble</a>
<a id='line_8438'>jouster, for or now we saw never no knight match the Red Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_8439'>Red Launds: thus they said, both within the castle and without. Then</a>
<a id='line_8440'>lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and</a>
<a id='line_8441'>drew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions, and either</a>
<a id='line_8442'>gave other such buffets upon their helms that they reeled backward both</a>
<a id='line_8443'>two strides; and then they recovered both, and hewed great pieces off</a>
<a id='line_8444'>their harness and their shields that a great part fell into the fields.</a>
<a id='line_8445'></a>
<a id='line_8446'></a>
<a id='line_8447'></a>
<a id='line_8448'>CHAPTER XVII. How after long fighting Beaumains overcame the knight and</a>
<a id='line_8449'>would have slain him, but at the request of the lords he saved his</a>
<a id='line_8450'>life, and made him to yield him to the lady.</a>
<a id='line_8451'></a>
<a id='line_8452'>And then thus they fought till it was past noon, and never would stint,</a>
<a id='line_8453'>till at the last they lacked wind both; and then they stood wagging and</a>
<a id='line_8454'>scattering, panting, blowing and bleeding, that all that beheld them</a>
<a id='line_8455'>for the most part wept for pity. So when they had rested them a while</a>
<a id='line_8456'>they yede to battle again, tracing, racing, foining as two boars. And</a>
<a id='line_8457'>at some time they took their run as it had been two rams, and hurtled</a>
<a id='line_8458'>together that sometime they fell grovelling to the earth: and at some</a>
<a id='line_8459'>time they were so amazed that either took other’s sword instead of his</a>
<a id='line_8460'>own.</a>
<a id='line_8461'></a>
<a id='line_8462'>Thus they endured till evensong time, that there was none that beheld</a>
<a id='line_8463'>them might know whether was like to win the battle; and their armour</a>
<a id='line_8464'>was so forhewn that men might see their naked sides; and in other</a>
<a id='line_8465'>places they were naked, but ever the naked places they did defend. And</a>
<a id='line_8466'>the Red Knight was a wily knight of war, and his wily fighting taught</a>
<a id='line_8467'>Sir Beaumains to be wise; but he abought it full sore or he did espy</a>
<a id='line_8468'>his fighting.</a>
<a id='line_8469'></a>
<a id='line_8470'>And thus by assent of them both they granted either other to rest; and</a>
<a id='line_8471'>so they set them down upon two mole-hills there beside the fighting</a>
<a id='line_8472'>place, and either of them unlaced his helm, and took the cold wind; for</a>
<a id='line_8473'>either of their pages was fast by them, to come when they called to</a>
<a id='line_8474'>unlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment. And</a>
<a id='line_8475'>then when Sir Beaumains’ helm was off, he looked up to the window, and</a>
<a id='line_8476'>there he saw the fair lady Dame Lionesse, and she made him such</a>
<a id='line_8477'>countenance that his heart waxed light and jolly; and therewith he bade</a>
<a id='line_8478'>the Red Knight of the Red Launds make him ready, and let us do the</a>
<a id='line_8479'>battle to the utterance. I will well, said the knight, and then they</a>
<a id='line_8480'>laced up their helms, and their pages avoided, and they stepped</a>
<a id='line_8481'>together and fought freshly; but the Red Knight of the Red Launds</a>
<a id='line_8482'>awaited him, and at an overthwart smote him within the hand, that his</a>
<a id='line_8483'>sword fell out of his hand; and yet he gave him another buffet upon the</a>
<a id='line_8484'>helm that he fell grovelling to the earth, and the Red Knight fell over</a>
<a id='line_8485'>him, for to hold him down.</a>
<a id='line_8486'></a>
<a id='line_8487'>Then cried the maiden Linet on high: O Sir Beaumains, where is thy</a>
<a id='line_8488'>courage become? Alas, my lady my sister beholdeth thee, and she sobbeth</a>
<a id='line_8489'>and weepeth, that maketh mine heart heavy. When Sir Beaumains heard her</a>
<a id='line_8490'>say so, he abraid up with a great might and gat him upon his feet, and</a>
<a id='line_8491'>lightly he leapt to his sword and gripped it in his hand, and doubled</a>
<a id='line_8492'>his pace unto the Red Knight, and there they fought a new battle</a>
<a id='line_8493'>together. But Sir Beaumains then doubled his strokes, and smote so</a>
<a id='line_8494'>thick that he smote the sword out of his hand, and then he smote him</a>
<a id='line_8495'>upon the helm that he fell to the earth, and Sir Beaumains fell upon</a>
<a id='line_8496'>him, and unlaced his helm to have slain him; and then he yielded him</a>
<a id='line_8497'>and asked mercy, and said with a loud voice: O noble knight, I yield me</a>
<a id='line_8498'>to thy mercy.</a>
<a id='line_8499'></a>
<a id='line_8500'>Then Sir Beaumains bethought him upon the knights that he had made to</a>
<a id='line_8501'>be hanged shamefully, and then he said: I may not with my worship save</a>
<a id='line_8502'>thy life, for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good</a>
<a id='line_8503'>knights to die. Sir, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, hold your</a>
<a id='line_8504'>hand and ye shall know the causes why I put them to so shameful a</a>
<a id='line_8505'>death. Say on, said Sir Beaumains. Sir, I loved once a lady, a fair</a>
<a id='line_8506'>damosel, and she had her brother slain; and she said it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_8507'>Launcelot du Lake, or else Sir Gawaine; and she prayed me as that I</a>
<a id='line_8508'>loved her heartily, that I would make her a promise by the faith of my</a>
<a id='line_8509'>knighthood, for to labour daily in arms unto I met with one of them;</a>
<a id='line_8510'>and all that I might overcome I should put them unto a villainous</a>
<a id='line_8511'>death; and this is the cause that I have put all these knights to</a>
<a id='line_8512'>death, and so I ensured her to do all the villainy unto King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_8513'>knights, and that I should take vengeance upon all these knights. And,</a>
<a id='line_8514'>sir, now I will thee tell that every day my strength increaseth till</a>
<a id='line_8515'>noon, and all this time have I seven men’s strength.</a>
<a id='line_8516'></a>

<a id='line_8519'>CHAPTER XVIII. How the knight yielded him, and how Beaumains made him</a>
<a id='line_8520'>to go unto King Arthur’s court, and to cry Sir Launcelot mercy.</a>
<a id='line_8521'></a>
<a id='line_8522'>Then came there many earls, and barons, and noble knights, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_8523'>that knight to save his life, and take him to your prisoner. And all</a>
<a id='line_8524'>they fell upon their knees, and prayed him of mercy, and that he would</a>
<a id='line_8525'>save his life; and, Sir, they all said, it were fairer of him to take</a>
<a id='line_8526'>homage and fealty, and let him hold his lands of you than for to slay</a>
<a id='line_8527'>him; by his death ye shall have none advantage, and his misdeeds that</a>
<a id='line_8528'>be done may not be undone; and therefore he shall make amends to all</a>
<a id='line_8529'>parties, and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty.</a>
<a id='line_8530'>Fair lords, said Beaumains, wit you well I am full loath to slay this</a>
<a id='line_8531'>knight, nevertheless he hath done passing ill and shamefully; but</a>
<a id='line_8532'>insomuch all that he did was at a lady’s request I blame him the less;</a>
<a id='line_8533'>and so for your sake I will release him that he shall have his life</a>
<a id='line_8534'>upon this covenant, that he go within the castle, and yield him there</a>
<a id='line_8535'>to the lady, and if she will forgive and quit him, I will well; with</a>
<a id='line_8536'>this he make her amends of all the trespass he hath done against her</a>
<a id='line_8537'>and her lands. And also, when that is done, that ye go unto the court</a>
<a id='line_8538'>of King Arthur, and there that ye ask Sir Launcelot mercy, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8539'>Gawaine, for the evil will ye have had against them. Sir, said the Red</a>
<a id='line_8540'>Knight of the Red Launds, all this will I do as ye command, and siker</a>
<a id='line_8541'>assurance and borrows ye shall have. And so then when the assurance was</a>
<a id='line_8542'>made, he made his homage and fealty, and all those earls and barons</a>
<a id='line_8543'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_8544'></a>
<a id='line_8545'>And then the maiden Linet came to Sir Beaumains, and unarmed him and</a>
<a id='line_8546'>searched his wounds, and stinted his blood, and in likewise she did to</a>
<a id='line_8547'>the Red Knight of the Red Launds. And there they sojourned ten days in</a>
<a id='line_8548'>their tents; and the Red Knight made his lords and servants to do all</a>
<a id='line_8549'>the pleasure that they might unto Sir Beaumains. And so within a while</a>
<a id='line_8550'>the Red Knight of the Red Launds yede unto the castle, and put him in</a>
<a id='line_8551'>her grace. And so she received him upon sufficient surety, so all her</a>
<a id='line_8552'>hurts were well restored of all that she could complain. And then he</a>
<a id='line_8553'>departed unto the court of King Arthur, and there openly the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_8554'>of the Red Launds put him in the mercy of Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8555'>Gawaine, and there he told openly how he was overcome and by whom, and</a>
<a id='line_8556'>also he told all the battles from the beginning unto the ending. Jesu</a>
<a id='line_8557'>mercy, said King Arthur and Sir Gawaine, we marvel much of what blood</a>
<a id='line_8558'>he is come, for he is a noble knight. Have ye no marvel, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8559'>Launcelot, for ye shall right well wit that he is come of a full noble</a>
<a id='line_8560'>blood; and as for his might and hardiness, there be but few now living</a>
<a id='line_8561'>that is so mighty as he is, and so noble of prowess. It seemeth by you,</a>
<a id='line_8562'>said King Arthur, that ye know his name, and from whence he is come,</a>
<a id='line_8563'>and of what blood he is. I suppose I do so, said Launcelot, or else I</a>
<a id='line_8564'>would not have given him the order of knighthood; but he gave me such</a>
<a id='line_8565'>charge at that time that I should never discover him until he required</a>
<a id='line_8566'>me, or else it be known openly by some other.</a>
<a id='line_8567'></a>
<a id='line_8568'></a>
<a id='line_8569'></a>
<a id='line_8570'>CHAPTER XIX. How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the</a>
<a id='line_8571'>castle the gates were closed against him, and of the words that the</a>
<a id='line_8572'>lady said to him.</a>
<a id='line_8573'></a>
<a id='line_8574'>Now turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he might see</a>
<a id='line_8575'>her sister, his lady. Sir, she said, I would fain ye saw her. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_8576'>Beaumains all armed him, and took his horse and his spear, and rode</a>
<a id='line_8577'>straight unto the castle. And when he came to the gate he found there</a>
<a id='line_8578'>many men armed, and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port close.</a>
<a id='line_8579'></a>
<a id='line_8580'>Then marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter. And then he</a>
<a id='line_8581'>looked up to the window; and there he saw the fair Lionesse that said</a>
<a id='line_8582'>on high: Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as yet thou shalt not have</a>
<a id='line_8583'>wholly my love, unto the time that thou be called one of the number of</a>
<a id='line_8584'>the worthy knights. And therefore go labour in worship this</a>
<a id='line_8585'>twelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear new tidings. Alas, fair lady,</a>
<a id='line_8586'>said Beaumains, I have not deserved that ye should show me this</a>
<a id='line_8587'>strangeness, and I had weened that I should have right good cheer with</a>
<a id='line_8588'>you, and unto my power I have deserved thank, and well I am sure I have</a>
<a id='line_8589'>bought your love with part of the best blood within my body. Fair</a>
<a id='line_8590'>courteous knight, said Dame Lionesse, be not displeased nor over-hasty;</a>
<a id='line_8591'>for wit you well your great travail nor good love shall not be lost,</a>
<a id='line_8592'>for I consider your great travail and labour, your bounty and your</a>
<a id='line_8593'>goodness as me ought to do. And therefore go on your way, and look that</a>
<a id='line_8594'>ye be of good comfort, for all shall be for your worship and for the</a>
<a id='line_8595'>best, and perdy a twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair</a>
<a id='line_8596'>knight, I shall be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my</a>
<a id='line_8597'>death I shall love you and none other. And therewithal she turned her</a>
<a id='line_8598'>from the window, and Sir Beaumains rode awayward from the castle,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>making great dole, and so he rode here and there and wist not where he</a>
<a id='line_8600'>rode, till it was dark night. And then it happened him to come to a</a>
<a id='line_8601'>poor man’s house, and there he was harboured all that night.</a>
<a id='line_8602'></a>
<a id='line_8603'>But Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the love of</a>
<a id='line_8604'>the lady of the castle. And so upon the morrow he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_8605'>rode until underne, and then he came to a broad water, and thereby was</a>
<a id='line_8606'>a great lodge, and there he alighted to sleep and laid his head upon</a>
<a id='line_8607'>the shield, and betook his horse to the dwarf, and commanded him to</a>
<a id='line_8608'>watch all night.</a>
<a id='line_8609'></a>
<a id='line_8610'>Now turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much upon</a>
<a id='line_8611'>Beaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her brother, and</a>
<a id='line_8612'>prayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily, that he would ride</a>
<a id='line_8613'>after Sir Beaumains: And ever have ye wait upon him till ye may find</a>
<a id='line_8614'>him sleeping, for I am sure in his heaviness he will alight down in</a>
<a id='line_8615'>some place, and lie him down to sleep; and therefore have ye your wait</a>
<a id='line_8616'>upon him, and in the priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye</a>
<a id='line_8617'>your way with him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake. For my</a>
<a id='line_8618'>sister Linet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come,</a>
<a id='line_8619'>and what is his right name. And the meanwhile I and my sister will ride</a>
<a id='line_8620'>unto your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. And then</a>
<a id='line_8621'>when ye have brought him unto your castle, I will have him in</a>
<a id='line_8622'>examination myself. Unto the time that I know what is his right name,</a>
<a id='line_8623'>and of what kindred he is come, shall I never be merry at my heart.</a>
<a id='line_8624'>Sister, said Sir Gringamore, all this shall be done after your intent.</a>
<a id='line_8625'></a>
<a id='line_8626'>And so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found Sir</a>
<a id='line_8627'>Beaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_8628'>And then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he came stilly stalking</a>
<a id='line_8629'>behind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under his arm, and so he rode</a>
<a id='line_8630'>away with him as fast as ever he might unto his own castle. And this</a>
<a id='line_8631'>Sir Gringamore’s arms were all black, and that to him longeth. But ever</a>
<a id='line_8632'>as he rode with the dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and</a>
<a id='line_8633'>prayed him of help. And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt</a>
<a id='line_8634'>lightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the dwarf, and</a>
<a id='line_8635'>so Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.</a>
<a id='line_8636'></a>
<a id='line_8637'></a>
<a id='line_8638'></a>
<a id='line_8639'>CHAPTER XX. How Sir Beaumains rode after to rescue his dwarf, and came</a>
<a id='line_8640'>into the castle where he was.</a>
<a id='line_8641'></a>
<a id='line_8642'>Then Sir Beaumains put on his helm anon, and buckled his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_8643'>took his horse, and rode after him all that ever he might ride through</a>
<a id='line_8644'>marshes, and fields, and great dales, that many times his horse and he</a>
<a id='line_8645'>plunged over the head in deep mires, for he knew not the way, but took</a>
<a id='line_8646'>the gainest way in that woodness, that many times he was like to</a>
<a id='line_8647'>perish. And at the last him happened to come to a fair green way, and</a>
<a id='line_8648'>there he met with a poor man of the country, whom he saluted and asked</a>
<a id='line_8649'>him whether he met not with a knight upon a black horse and all black</a>
<a id='line_8650'>harness, a little dwarf sitting behind him with heavy cheer. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8651'>the poor man, here by me came Sir Gringamore the knight, with such a</a>
<a id='line_8652'>dwarf mourning as ye say; and therefore I rede you not follow him, for</a>
<a id='line_8653'>he is one of the periloust knights of the world, and his castle is here</a>
<a id='line_8654'>nigh hand but two mile; therefore we advise you ride not after Sir</a>
<a id='line_8655'>Gringamore, but if ye owe him good will.</a>
<a id='line_8656'></a>
<a id='line_8657'>So leave we Sir Beaumains riding toward the castle, and speak we of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8658'>Gringamore and the dwarf. Anon as the dwarf was come to the castle,</a>
<a id='line_8659'>Dame Lionesse and Dame Linet her sister, asked the dwarf where was his</a>
<a id='line_8660'>master born, and of what lineage he was come. And but if thou tell me,</a>
<a id='line_8661'>said Dame Lionesse, thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here</a>
<a id='line_8662'>to be prisoner. As for that, said the dwarf, I fear not greatly to tell</a>
<a id='line_8663'>his name and of what kin he is come. Wit you well he is a king’s son,</a>
<a id='line_8664'>and his mother is sister to King Arthur, and he is brother to the good</a>
<a id='line_8665'>knight Sir Gawaine, and his name is Sir Gareth of Orkney. And now I</a>
<a id='line_8666'>have told you his right name, I pray you, fair lady, let me go to my</a>
<a id='line_8667'>lord again, for he will never out of this country until that he have me</a>
<a id='line_8668'>again. And if he be angry he will do much harm or that he be stint, and</a>
<a id='line_8669'>work you wrack in this country. As for that threatening, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8670'>Gringamore, be it as it be may, we will go to dinner. And so they</a>
<a id='line_8671'>washed and went to meat, and made them merry and well at ease, and</a>
<a id='line_8672'>because the Lady Lionesse of the castle was there, they made great joy.</a>
<a id='line_8673'>Truly, madam, said Linet unto her sister, well may he be a king’s son,</a>
<a id='line_8674'>for he hath many good tatches on him, for he is courteous and mild, and</a>
<a id='line_8675'>the most suffering man that ever I met withal. For I dare say there was</a>
<a id='line_8676'>never gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as I have rebuked</a>
<a id='line_8677'>him; and at all times he gave me goodly and meek answers again.</a>
<a id='line_8678'></a>
<a id='line_8679'>And as they sat thus talking, there came Sir Gareth in at the gate with</a>
<a id='line_8680'>an angry countenance, and his sword drawn in his hand, and cried aloud</a>
<a id='line_8681'>that all the castle might hear it, saying: Thou traitor, Sir</a>
<a id='line_8682'>Gringamore, deliver me my dwarf again, or by the faith that I owe to</a>
<a id='line_8683'>the order of knighthood, I shall do thee all the harm that I can. Then</a>
<a id='line_8684'>Sir Gringamore looked out at a window and said, Sir Gareth of Orkney,</a>
<a id='line_8685'>leave thy boasting words, for thou gettest not thy dwarf again. Thou</a>
<a id='line_8686'>coward knight, said Sir Gareth, bring him with thee, and come and do</a>
<a id='line_8687'>battle with me, and win him and take him. So will I do, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8688'>Gringamore, an me list, but for all thy great words thou gettest him</a>
<a id='line_8689'>not. Ah! fair brother, said Dame Lionesse, I would he had his dwarf</a>
<a id='line_8690'>again, for I would he were not wroth, for now he hath told me all my</a>
<a id='line_8691'>desire I keep no more of the dwarf. And also, brother, he hath done</a>
<a id='line_8692'>much for me, and delivered me from the Red Knight of the Red Launds,</a>
<a id='line_8693'>and therefore, brother, I owe him my service afore all knights living.</a>
<a id='line_8694'>And wit ye well that I love him before all other, and full fain I would</a>
<a id='line_8695'>speak with him. But in nowise I would that he wist what I were, but</a>
<a id='line_8696'>that I were another strange lady.</a>
<a id='line_8697'></a>
<a id='line_8698'>Well, said Sir Gringamore, sithen I know now your will, I will obey now</a>
<a id='line_8699'>unto him. And right therewithal he went down unto Sir Gareth, and said:</a>
<a id='line_8700'>Sir, I cry you mercy, and all that I have misdone I will amend it at</a>
<a id='line_8701'>your will. And therefore I pray you that ye would alight, and take such</a>
<a id='line_8702'>cheer as I can make you in this castle. Shall I have my dwarf? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8703'>Gareth. Yea, sir, and all the pleasaunce that I can make you, for as</a>
<a id='line_8704'>soon as your dwarf told me what ye were and of what blood ye are come,</a>
<a id='line_8705'>and what noble deeds ye have done in these marches, then I repented of</a>
<a id='line_8706'>my deeds. And then Sir Gareth alighted, and there came his dwarf and</a>
<a id='line_8707'>took his horse. O my fellow, said Sir Gareth, I have had many</a>
<a id='line_8708'>adventures for thy sake. And so Sir Gringamore took him by the hand and</a>
<a id='line_8709'>led him into the hall where his own wife was.</a>
<a id='line_8710'></a>
<a id='line_8711'></a>
<a id='line_8712'></a>
<a id='line_8713'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the</a>
<a id='line_8714'>presence of his lady, and how they took acquaintance, and of their</a>
<a id='line_8715'>love.</a>
<a id='line_8716'></a>
<a id='line_8717'>And then came forth Dame Lionesse arrayed like a princess, and there</a>
<a id='line_8718'>she made him passing good cheer, and he her again; and they had goodly</a>
<a id='line_8719'>language and lovely countenance together. And Sir Gareth thought many</a>
<a id='line_8720'>times, Jesu, would that the lady of the Castle Perilous were so fair as</a>
<a id='line_8721'>she was. There were all manner of games and plays, of dancing and</a>
<a id='line_8722'>singing. And ever the more Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he</a>
<a id='line_8723'>loved her; and so he burned in love that he was past himself in his</a>
<a id='line_8724'>reason; and forth toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth</a>
<a id='line_8725'>might not eat, for his love was so hot that he wist not where he was.</a>
<a id='line_8726'></a>
<a id='line_8727'>All these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at-after supper he</a>
<a id='line_8728'>called his sister Dame Lionesse into a chamber, and said: Fair sister,</a>
<a id='line_8729'>I have well espied your countenance betwixt you and this knight, and I</a>
<a id='line_8730'>will, sister, that ye wit he is a full noble knight, and if ye can make</a>
<a id='line_8731'>him to abide here I will do him all the pleasure that I can, for an ye</a>
<a id='line_8732'>were better than ye are, ye were well bywaryd upon him. Fair brother,</a>
<a id='line_8733'>said Dame Lionesse, I understand well that the knight is good, and come</a>
<a id='line_8734'>he is of a noble house. Notwithstanding, I will assay him better,</a>
<a id='line_8735'>howbeit I am most beholden to him of any earthly man; for he hath had</a>
<a id='line_8736'>great labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous passage.</a>
<a id='line_8737'></a>
<a id='line_8738'>Right so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, Sir, make ye</a>
<a id='line_8739'>good cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady, my</a>
<a id='line_8740'>sister, is yours at all times, her worship saved, for wit ye well she</a>
<a id='line_8741'>loveth you as well as ye do her, and better if better may be. An I wist</a>
<a id='line_8742'>that, said Sir Gareth, there lived not a gladder man than I would be.</a>
<a id='line_8743'>Upon my worship, said Sir Gringamore, trust unto my promise; and as</a>
<a id='line_8744'>long as it liketh you ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall be</a>
<a id='line_8745'>with us daily and nightly to make you all the cheer that she can. I</a>
<a id='line_8746'>will well, said Sir Gareth, for I have promised to be nigh this country</a>
<a id='line_8747'>this twelvemonth. And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble</a>
<a id='line_8748'>knights will find me where that I am within this twelvemonth. For I</a>
<a id='line_8749'>shall be sought and found, if that I be alive. And then the noble</a>
<a id='line_8750'>knight Sir Gareth went unto the Dame Lionesse, which he then much</a>
<a id='line_8751'>loved, and kissed her many times, and either made great joy of other.</a>
<a id='line_8752'>And there she promised him her love certainly, to love him and none</a>
<a id='line_8753'>other the days of her life. Then this lady, Dame Lionesse, by the</a>
<a id='line_8754'>assent of her brother, told Sir Gareth all the truth what she was, and</a>
<a id='line_8755'>how she was the same lady that he did battle for, and how she was lady</a>
<a id='line_8756'>of the Castle Perilous, and there she told him how she caused her</a>
<a id='line_8757'>brother to take away his dwarf.</a>
<a id='line_8758'></a>
<a id='line_8759'></a>
<a id='line_8760'></a>
<a id='line_8761'>CHAPTER XXII. How at night came an armed knight, and fought with Sir</a>
<a id='line_8762'>Gareth, and he, sore hurt in the thigh, smote off the knight’s head.</a>
<a id='line_8763'></a>
<a id='line_8764'>For this cause, to know the certainty what was your name, and of what</a>
<a id='line_8765'>kin ye were come.</a>
<a id='line_8766'></a>
<a id='line_8767'>And then she let fetch to-fore him Linet, the damosel that had ridden</a>
<a id='line_8768'>with him many wildsome ways. Then was Sir Gareth more gladder than he</a>
<a id='line_8769'>was to-fore. And then they troth-plight each other to love, and never</a>
<a id='line_8770'>to fail whiles their life lasteth. And so they burnt both in love, that</a>
<a id='line_8771'>they were accorded to abate their lusts secretly. And there Dame</a>
<a id='line_8772'>Lionesse counselled Sir Gareth to sleep in none other place but in the</a>
<a id='line_8773'>hall. And there she promised him to come to his bed a little afore</a>
<a id='line_8774'>midnight.</a>
<a id='line_8775'></a>
<a id='line_8776'>This counsel was not so privily kept but it was understood; for they</a>
<a id='line_8777'>were but young both, and tender of age, and had not used none such</a>
<a id='line_8778'>crafts to-fore. Wherefore the damosel Linet was a little displeased,</a>
<a id='line_8779'>and she thought her sister Dame Lionesse was a little over-hasty, that</a>
<a id='line_8780'>she might not abide the time of her marriage; and for saving their</a>
<a id='line_8781'>worship, she thought to abate their hot lusts. And so she let ordain by</a>
<a id='line_8782'>her subtle crafts that they had not their intents neither with other,</a>
<a id='line_8783'>as in their delights, until they were married. And so it passed on.</a>
<a id='line_8784'>At-after supper was made clean avoidance, that every lord and lady</a>
<a id='line_8785'>should go unto his rest. But Sir Gareth said plainly he would go no</a>
<a id='line_8786'>farther than the hall, for in such places, he said, was convenient for</a>
<a id='line_8787'>an errant-knight to take his rest in; and so there were ordained great</a>
<a id='line_8788'>couches, and thereon feather beds, and there laid him down to sleep;</a>
<a id='line_8789'>and within a while came Dame Lionesse, wrapped in a mantle furred with</a>
<a id='line_8790'>ermine, and laid her down beside Sir Gareth. And therewithal he began</a>
<a id='line_8791'>to kiss her. And then he looked afore him, and there he apperceived and</a>
<a id='line_8792'>saw come an armed knight, with many lights about him; and this knight</a>
<a id='line_8793'>had a long gisarm in his hand, and made grim countenance to smite him.</a>
<a id='line_8794'>When Sir Gareth saw him come in that wise, he leapt out of his bed, and</a>
<a id='line_8795'>gat in his hand his sword, and leapt straight toward that knight. And</a>
<a id='line_8796'>when the knight saw Sir Gareth come so fiercely upon him, he smote him</a>
<a id='line_8797'>with a foin through the thick of the thigh that the wound was a</a>
<a id='line_8798'>shaftmon broad and had cut a-two many veins and sinews. And therewithal</a>
<a id='line_8799'>Sir Gareth smote him upon the helm such a buffet that he fell</a>
<a id='line_8800'>grovelling; and then he leapt over him and unlaced his helm, and smote</a>
<a id='line_8801'>off his head from the body. And then he bled so fast that he might not</a>
<a id='line_8802'>stand, but so he laid him down upon his bed, and there he swooned and</a>
<a id='line_8803'>lay as he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_8804'></a>
<a id='line_8805'>Then Dame Lionesse cried aloud, that her brother Sir Gringamore heard,</a>
<a id='line_8806'>and came down. And when he saw Sir Gareth so shamefully wounded he was</a>
<a id='line_8807'>sore displeased, and said: I am shamed that this noble knight is thus</a>
<a id='line_8808'>honoured. Sir, said Sir Gringamore, how may this be, that ye be here,</a>
<a id='line_8809'>and this noble knight wounded? Brother, she said, I can not tell you,</a>
<a id='line_8810'>for it was not done by me, nor by mine assent. For he is my lord and I</a>
<a id='line_8811'>am his, and he must be mine husband; therefore, my brother, I will that</a>
<a id='line_8812'>ye wit I shame me not to be with him, nor to do him all the pleasure</a>
<a id='line_8813'>that I can. Sister, said Sir Gringamore, and I will that ye wit it, and</a>
<a id='line_8814'>Sir Gareth both, that it was never done by me, nor by my assent that</a>
<a id='line_8815'>this unhappy deed was done. And there they staunched his bleeding as</a>
<a id='line_8816'>well as they might, and great sorrow made Sir Gringamore and Dame</a>
<a id='line_8817'>Lionesse.</a>
<a id='line_8818'></a>
<a id='line_8819'>And forthwithal came Dame Linet, and took up the head in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_8820'>them all, and anointed it with an ointment thereas it was smitten off;</a>
<a id='line_8821'>and in the same wise she did to the other part thereas the head stuck,</a>
<a id='line_8822'>and then she set it together, and it stuck as fast as ever it did. And</a>
<a id='line_8823'>the knight arose lightly up, and the damosel Linet put him in her</a>
<a id='line_8824'>chamber. All this saw Sir Gringamore and Dame Lionesse, and so did Sir</a>
<a id='line_8825'>Gareth; and well he espied that it was the damosel Linet, that rode</a>
<a id='line_8826'>with him through the perilous passages. Ah well, damosel, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8827'>Gareth, I weened ye would not have done as ye have done. My lord</a>
<a id='line_8828'>Gareth, said Linet, all that I have done I will avow, and all that I</a>
<a id='line_8829'>have done shall be for your honour and worship, and to us all. And so</a>
<a id='line_8830'>within a while Sir Gareth was nigh whole, and waxed light and jocund,</a>
<a id='line_8831'>and sang, danced, and gamed; and he and Dame Lionesse were so hot in</a>
<a id='line_8832'>burning love that they made their covenant at the tenth night after,</a>
<a id='line_8833'>that she should come to his bed. And because he was wounded afore, he</a>
<a id='line_8834'>laid his armour and his sword nigh his bed’s side.</a>
<a id='line_8835'></a>
<a id='line_8836'></a>
<a id='line_8837'></a>
<a id='line_8838'>CHAPTER XXIII. How the said knight came again the next night and was</a>
<a id='line_8839'>beheaded again, and how at the feast of Pentecost all the knights that</a>
<a id='line_8840'>Sir Gareth had overcome came and yielded them to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_8841'></a>
<a id='line_8842'>Right as she promised she came; and she was not so soon in his bed but</a>
<a id='line_8843'>she espied an armed knight coming toward the bed: therewithal she</a>
<a id='line_8844'>warned Sir Gareth, and lightly through the good help of Dame Lionesse</a>
<a id='line_8845'>he was armed; and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all</a>
<a id='line_8846'>about the hall; and there was great light as it had been the number of</a>
<a id='line_8847'>twenty torches both before and behind, so that Sir Gareth strained him,</a>
<a id='line_8848'>so that his old wound brast again a-bleeding; but he was hot and</a>
<a id='line_8849'>courageous and took no keep, but with his great force he struck down</a>
<a id='line_8850'>that knight, and voided his helm, and struck off his head. Then he</a>
<a id='line_8851'>hewed the head in an hundred pieces. And when he had done so he took up</a>
<a id='line_8852'>all those pieces, and threw them out at a window into the ditches of</a>
<a id='line_8853'>the castle; and by this done he was so faint that unnethes he might</a>
<a id='line_8854'>stand for bleeding. And by when he was almost unarmed he fell in a</a>
<a id='line_8855'>deadly swoon on the floor; and then Dame Lionesse cried so that Sir</a>
<a id='line_8856'>Gringamore heard; and when he came and found Sir Gareth in that plight</a>
<a id='line_8857'>he made great sorrow; and there he awaked Sir Gareth, and gave him a</a>
<a id='line_8858'>drink that relieved him wonderly well; but the sorrow that Dame</a>
<a id='line_8859'>Lionesse made there may no tongue tell, for she so fared with herself</a>
<a id='line_8860'>as she would have died.</a>
<a id='line_8861'></a>
<a id='line_8862'>Right so came this damosel Linet before them all, and she had fetched</a>
<a id='line_8863'>all the gobbets of the head that Sir Gareth had thrown out at a window,</a>
<a id='line_8864'>and there she anointed them as she had done to-fore, and set them</a>
<a id='line_8865'>together again. Well, damosel Linet, said Sir Gareth, I have not</a>
<a id='line_8866'>deserved all this despite that ye do unto me. Sir knight, she said, I</a>
<a id='line_8867'>have nothing done but I will avow, and all that I have done shall be to</a>
<a id='line_8868'>your worship, and to us all. And then was Sir Gareth staunched of his</a>
<a id='line_8869'>bleeding. But the leeches said that there was no man that bare the life</a>
<a id='line_8870'>should heal him throughout of his wound but if they healed him that</a>
<a id='line_8871'>caused that stroke by enchantment.</a>
<a id='line_8872'></a>
<a id='line_8873'>So leave we Sir Gareth there with Sir Gringamore and his sisters, and</a>
<a id='line_8874'>turn we unto King Arthur, that at the next feast of Pentecost held his</a>
<a id='line_8875'>feast; and there came the Green Knight with fifty knights, and yielded</a>
<a id='line_8876'>them all unto King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight his</a>
<a id='line_8877'>brother, and yielded him to King Arthur, and three score knights with</a>
<a id='line_8878'>him. Also there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an hundred</a>
<a id='line_8879'>knights, and yielded them unto King Arthur; and the Green Knight’s name</a>
<a id='line_8880'>was Pertolepe, and the Red Knight’s name was Perimones, and the Blue</a>
<a id='line_8881'>Knight’s name was Sir Persant of Inde. These three brethren told King</a>
<a id='line_8882'>Arthur how they were overcome by a knight that a damosel had with her,</a>
<a id='line_8883'>and called him Beaumains. Jesu, said the king, I marvel what knight he</a>
<a id='line_8884'>is, and of what lineage he is come. He was with me a twelvemonth, and</a>
<a id='line_8885'>poorly and shamefully he was fostered, and Sir Kay in scorn named him</a>
<a id='line_8886'>Beaumains. So right as the king stood so talking with these three</a>
<a id='line_8887'>brethren, there came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told the king that</a>
<a id='line_8888'>there was come a goodly lord with six hundred knights with him.</a>
<a id='line_8889'></a>
<a id='line_8890'>Then the king went out of Carlion, for there was the feast, and there</a>
<a id='line_8891'>came to him this lord, and saluted the king in a goodly manner. What</a>
<a id='line_8892'>will ye, said King Arthur, and what is your errand? Sir, he said, my</a>
<a id='line_8893'>name is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, but my name is Sir Ironside;</a>
<a id='line_8894'>and sir, wit ye well, here I am sent to you of a knight that is called</a>
<a id='line_8895'>Beaumains, for he won me in plain battle hand for hand, and so did</a>
<a id='line_8896'>never no knight but he, that ever had the better of me this thirty</a>
<a id='line_8897'>winter; the which commanded to yield me to you at your will. Ye are</a>
<a id='line_8898'>welcome, said the king, for ye have been long a great foe to me and my</a>
<a id='line_8899'>court, and now I trust to God I shall so entreat you that ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_8900'>my friend. Sir, both I and these five hundred knights shall always be</a>
<a id='line_8901'>at your summons to do you service as may lie in our powers. Jesu mercy,</a>
<a id='line_8902'>said King Arthur, I am much beholden unto that knight that hath put so</a>
<a id='line_8903'>his body in devoir to worship me and my court. And as to thee,</a>
<a id='line_8904'>Ironside, that art called the Red Knight of the Red Launds, thou art</a>
<a id='line_8905'>called a perilous knight; and if thou wilt hold of me I shall worship</a>
<a id='line_8906'>thee and make thee knight of the Table Round; but then thou must be no</a>
<a id='line_8907'>more a murderer. Sir, as to that, I have promised unto Sir Beaumains</a>
<a id='line_8908'>never more to use such customs, for all the shameful customs that I</a>
<a id='line_8909'>used I did at the request of a lady that I loved; and therefore I must</a>
<a id='line_8910'>go unto Sir Launcelot, and unto Sir Gawaine, and ask them forgiveness</a>
<a id='line_8911'>of the evil will I had unto them; for all that I put to death was all</a>
<a id='line_8912'>only for the love of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Gawaine. They be here</a>
<a id='line_8913'>now, said the king, afore thee, now may ye say to them what ye will.</a>
<a id='line_8914'>And then he kneeled down unto Sir Launcelot, and to Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_8915'>prayed them of forgiveness of his enmity that ever he had against them.</a>
<a id='line_8916'></a>
<a id='line_8917'></a>
<a id='line_8918'></a>
<a id='line_8919'>CHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur pardoned them, and demanded of them where</a>
<a id='line_8920'>Sir Gareth was.</a>
<a id='line_8921'></a>
<a id='line_8922'>Then goodly they said all at once, God forgive you, and we do, and pray</a>
<a id='line_8923'>you that ye will tell us where we may find Sir Beaumains. Fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_8924'>said Sir Ironside, I cannot tell you, for it is full hard to find him;</a>
<a id='line_8925'>for such young knights as he is one, when they be in their adventures</a>
<a id='line_8926'>be never abiding in no place. But to say the worship that the Red</a>
<a id='line_8927'>Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother said of</a>
<a id='line_8928'>Beaumains, it was marvel to hear. Well, my fair lords, said King</a>
<a id='line_8929'>Arthur, wit you well I shall do you honour for the love of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8930'>Beaumains, and as soon as ever I meet with him I shall make you all</a>
<a id='line_8931'>upon one day knights of the Table Round. And as to thee, Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_8932'>Inde, thou hast been ever called a full noble knight, and so have ever</a>
<a id='line_8933'>been thy three brethren called. But I marvel, said the king, that I</a>
<a id='line_8934'>hear not of the Black Knight your brother, he was a full noble knight.</a>
<a id='line_8935'>Sir, said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, Sir Beaumains slew him in a</a>
<a id='line_8936'>recounter with his spear, his name was Sir Percard. That was great</a>
<a id='line_8937'>pity, said the king, and so said many knights. For these four brethren</a>
<a id='line_8938'>were full well known in the court of King Arthur for noble knights, for</a>
<a id='line_8939'>long time they had holden war against the knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_8940'>Then said Pertolepe, the Green Knight, to the king: At a passage of the</a>
<a id='line_8941'>water of Mortaise there encountered Sir Beaumains with two brethren</a>
<a id='line_8942'>that ever for the most part kept that passage, and they were two deadly</a>
<a id='line_8943'>knights, and there he slew the eldest brother in the water, and smote</a>
<a id='line_8944'>him upon the head such a buffet that he fell down in the water, and</a>
<a id='line_8945'>there he was drowned, and his name was Sir Gherard le Breusse; and</a>
<a id='line_8946'>after he slew the other brother upon the land, his name was Sir Arnold</a>
<a id='line_8947'>le Breusse.</a>
<a id='line_8948'></a>
<a id='line_8949'></a>
<a id='line_8950'></a>
<a id='line_8951'>CHAPTER XXV. How the Queen of Orkney came to this feast of Pentecost,</a>
<a id='line_8952'>and Sir Gawaine and his brethren came to ask her blessing.</a>
<a id='line_8953'></a>
<a id='line_8954'>So then the king and they went to meat, and were served in the best</a>
<a id='line_8955'>manner. And as they sat at the meat, there came in the Queen of Orkney,</a>
<a id='line_8956'>with ladies and knights a great number. And then Sir Gawaine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_8957'>Agravaine, and Gaheris arose, and went to her and saluted her upon</a>
<a id='line_8958'>their knees, and asked her blessing; for in fifteen year they had not</a>
<a id='line_8959'>seen her. Then she spake on high to her brother King Arthur: Where have</a>
<a id='line_8960'>ye done my young son Sir Gareth? He was here amongst you a twelvemonth,</a>
<a id='line_8961'>and ye made a kitchen knave of him, the which is shame to you all.</a>
<a id='line_8962'>Alas, where have ye done my dear son that was my joy and bliss? O dear</a>
<a id='line_8963'>mother, said Sir Gawaine, I knew him not. Nor I, said the king, that</a>
<a id='line_8964'>now me repenteth, but thanked be God he is proved a worshipful knight</a>
<a id='line_8965'>as any is now living of his years, and I shall never be glad till I may</a>
<a id='line_8966'>find him.</a>
<a id='line_8967'></a>
<a id='line_8968'>Ah, brother, said the Queen unto King Arthur, and unto Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_8969'>to all her sons, ye did yourself great shame when ye amongst you kept</a>
<a id='line_8970'>my son in the kitchen and fed him like a poor hog. Fair sister, said</a>
<a id='line_8971'>King Arthur, ye shall right well wit I knew him not, nor no more did</a>
<a id='line_8972'>Sir Gawaine, nor his brethren; but sithen it is so, said the king, that</a>
<a id='line_8973'>he is thus gone from us all, we must shape a remedy to find him. Also,</a>
<a id='line_8974'>sister, meseemeth ye might have done me to wit of his coming, and then</a>
<a id='line_8975'>an I had not done well to him ye might have blamed me. For when he came</a>
<a id='line_8976'>to this court he came leaning upon two men’s shoulders, as though he</a>
<a id='line_8977'>might not have gone. And then he asked me three gifts; and one he asked</a>
<a id='line_8978'>the same day, that was that I would give him meat enough that</a>
<a id='line_8979'>twelvemonth; and the other two gifts he asked that day a twelvemonth,</a>
<a id='line_8980'>and that was that he might have the adventure of the damosel Linet, and</a>
<a id='line_8981'>the third was that Sir Launcelot should make him knight when he desired</a>
<a id='line_8982'>him. And so I granted him all his desire, and many in this court</a>
<a id='line_8983'>marvelled that he desired his sustenance for a twelvemonth. And</a>
<a id='line_8984'>thereby, we deemed, many of us, that he was not come of a noble house.</a>
<a id='line_8985'></a>
<a id='line_8986'>Sir, said the Queen of Orkney unto King Arthur her brother, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_8987'>that I sent him unto you right well armed and horsed, and worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_8988'>beseen of his body, and gold and silver plenty to spend. It may be,</a>
<a id='line_8989'>said the King, but thereof saw we none, save that same day as he</a>
<a id='line_8990'>departed from us, knights told me that there came a dwarf hither</a>
<a id='line_8991'>suddenly, and brought him armour and a good horse full well and richly</a>
<a id='line_8992'>beseen; and thereat we all had marvel from whence that riches came,</a>
<a id='line_8993'>that we deemed all that he was come of men of worship. Brother, said</a>
<a id='line_8994'>the queen, all that ye say I believe, for ever sithen he was grown he</a>
<a id='line_8995'>was marvellously witted, and ever he was faithful and true of his</a>
<a id='line_8996'>promise. But I marvel, said she, that Sir Kay did mock him and scorn</a>
<a id='line_8997'>him, and gave him that name Beaumains; yet, Sir Kay, said the queen,</a>
<a id='line_8998'>named him more righteously than he weened; for I dare say an he be</a>
<a id='line_8999'>alive, he is as fair an handed man and well disposed as any is living.</a>
<a id='line_9000'>Sir, said Arthur, let this language be still, and by the grace of God</a>
<a id='line_9001'>he shall be found an he be within this seven realms, and let all this</a>
<a id='line_9002'>pass and be merry, for he is proved to be a man of worship, and that is</a>
<a id='line_9003'>my joy.</a>
<a id='line_9004'></a>
<a id='line_9005'></a>
<a id='line_9006'></a>
<a id='line_9007'>CHAPTER XXVI. How King Arthur sent for the Lady Lionesse, and how she</a>
<a id='line_9008'>let cry a tourney at her castle, whereas came many knights.</a>
<a id='line_9009'></a>
<a id='line_9010'>Then said Sir Gawaine and his brethren unto Arthur, Sir, an ye will</a>
<a id='line_9011'>give us leave, we will go and seek our brother. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9012'>Launcelot, that shall ye not need; and so said Sir Baudwin of Britain:</a>
<a id='line_9013'>for as by our advice the king shall send unto Dame Lionesse a</a>
<a id='line_9014'>messenger, and pray her that she will come to the court in all the</a>
<a id='line_9015'>haste that she may, and doubt ye not she will come; and then she may</a>
<a id='line_9016'>give you best counsel where ye shall find him. This is well said of</a>
<a id='line_9017'>you, said the king. So then goodly letters were made, and the messenger</a>
<a id='line_9018'>sent forth, that night and day he went till he came unto the Castle</a>
<a id='line_9019'>Perilous. And then the lady Dame Lionesse was sent for, thereas she was</a>
<a id='line_9020'>with Sir Gringamore her brother and Sir Gareth. And when she understood</a>
<a id='line_9021'>this message, she bade him ride on his way unto King Arthur, and she</a>
<a id='line_9022'>would come after in all goodly haste. Then when she came to Sir</a>
<a id='line_9023'>Gringamore and to Sir Gareth, she told them all how King Arthur had</a>
<a id='line_9024'>sent for her. That is because of me, said Sir Gareth. Now advise me,</a>
<a id='line_9025'>said Dame Lionesse, what shall I say, and in what manner I shall rule</a>
<a id='line_9026'>me. My lady and my love, said Sir Gareth, I pray you in no wise be ye</a>
<a id='line_9027'>aknowen where I am; but well I wot my mother is there and all my</a>
<a id='line_9028'>brethren, and they will take upon them to seek me, I wot well that they</a>
<a id='line_9029'>do. But this, madam, I would ye said and advised the king when he</a>
<a id='line_9030'>questioned with you of me. Then may ye say, this is your advice that,</a>
<a id='line_9031'>an it like his good grace, ye will do make a cry against the feast of</a>
<a id='line_9032'>the Assumption of our Lady, that what knight there proveth him best he</a>
<a id='line_9033'>shall wield you and all your land. And if so be that he be a wedded</a>
<a id='line_9034'>man, that his wife shall have the degree, and a coronal of gold beset</a>
<a id='line_9035'>with stones of virtue to the value of a thousand pound, and a white</a>
<a id='line_9036'>gerfalcon.</a>
<a id='line_9037'></a>
<a id='line_9038'>So Dame Lionesse departed and came to King Arthur, where she was nobly</a>
<a id='line_9039'>received, and there she was sore questioned of the king and of the</a>
<a id='line_9040'>Queen of Orkney. And she answered, where Sir Gareth was she could not</a>
<a id='line_9041'>tell. But thus much she said unto Arthur: Sir, I will let cry a</a>
<a id='line_9042'>tournament that shall be done before my castle at the Assumption of our</a>
<a id='line_9043'>Lady, and the cry shall be this: that you, my lord Arthur, shall be</a>
<a id='line_9044'>there, and your knights, and I will purvey that my knights shall be</a>
<a id='line_9045'>against yours; and then I am sure ye shall hear of Sir Gareth. This is</a>
<a id='line_9046'>well advised, said King Arthur; and so she departed. And the king and</a>
<a id='line_9047'>she made great provision to that tournament.</a>
<a id='line_9048'></a>
<a id='line_9049'>When Dame Lionesse was come to the Isle of Avilion, that was the same</a>
<a id='line_9050'>isle thereas her brother Sir Gringamore dwelt, then she told them all</a>
<a id='line_9051'>how she had done, and what promise she had made to King Arthur. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_9052'>said Sir Gareth, I have been so wounded with unhappiness sithen I came</a>
<a id='line_9053'>into this castle that I shall not be able to do at that tournament like</a>
<a id='line_9054'>a knight; for I was never thoroughly whole since I was hurt. Be ye of</a>
<a id='line_9055'>good cheer, said the damosel Linet, for I undertake within these</a>
<a id='line_9056'>fifteen days to make ye whole, and as lusty as ever ye were. And then</a>
<a id='line_9057'>she laid an ointment and a salve to him as it pleased to her, that he</a>
<a id='line_9058'>was never so fresh nor so lusty. Then said the damosel Linet: Send you</a>
<a id='line_9059'>unto Sir Persant of Inde, and assummon him and his knights to be here</a>
<a id='line_9060'>with you as they have promised. Also, that ye send unto Sir Ironside,</a>
<a id='line_9061'>that is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and charge him that he be</a>
<a id='line_9062'>ready with you with his whole sum of knights, and then shall ye be able</a>
<a id='line_9063'>to match with King Arthur and his knights. So this was done, and all</a>
<a id='line_9064'>knights were sent for unto the Castle Perilous; and then the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9065'>answered and said unto Dame Lionesse, and to Sir Gareth, Madam, and my</a>
<a id='line_9066'>lord Sir Gareth, ye shall understand that I have been at the court of</a>
<a id='line_9067'>King Arthur, and Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren, and there we</a>
<a id='line_9068'>have done our homage as ye commanded us. Also Sir Ironside said, I have</a>
<a id='line_9069'>taken upon me with Sir Persant of Inde and his brethren to hold part</a>
<a id='line_9070'>against my lord Sir Launcelot and the knights of that court. And this</a>
<a id='line_9071'>have I done for the love of my lady Dame Lionesse, and you my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_9072'>Gareth. Ye have well done, said Sir Gareth; but wit you well ye shall</a>
<a id='line_9073'>be full sore matched with the most noble knights of the world;</a>
<a id='line_9074'>therefore we must purvey us of good knights, where we may get them.</a>
<a id='line_9075'>That is well said, said Sir Persant, and worshipfully.</a>
<a id='line_9076'></a>
<a id='line_9077'>And so the cry was made in England, Wales, and Scotland, Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9078'>Cornwall, and in all the Out Isles, and in Brittany and in many</a>
<a id='line_9079'>countries; that at the feast of our Lady the Assumption next coming,</a>
<a id='line_9080'>men should come to the Castle Perilous beside the Isle of Avilion; and</a>
<a id='line_9081'>there all the knights that there came should have the choice whether</a>
<a id='line_9082'>them list to be on the one party with the knights of the castle, or on</a>
<a id='line_9083'>the other party with King Arthur. And two months was to the day that</a>
<a id='line_9084'>the tournament should be. And so there came many good knights that were</a>
<a id='line_9085'>at their large, and held them for the most part against King Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_9086'>his knights of the Round Table and came in the side of them of the</a>
<a id='line_9087'>castle. For Sir Epinogrus was the first, and he was the king’s son of</a>
<a id='line_9088'>Northumberland, and Sir Palamides the Saracen was another, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9089'>Safere his brother, and Sir Segwarides his brother, but they were</a>
<a id='line_9090'>christened, and Sir Malegrine another, and Sir Brian de les Isles, a</a>
<a id='line_9091'>noble knight, and Sir Grummore Grummursum, a good knight of Scotland,</a>
<a id='line_9092'>and Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, a noble knight, and Sir Turquine</a>
<a id='line_9093'>his brother, and Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, two brethren, good knights</a>
<a id='line_9094'>of Cornwall. There came Sir Tristram de Liones, and with him Sir Dinas,</a>
<a id='line_9095'>the Seneschal, and Sir Sadok; but this Sir Tristram was not at that</a>
<a id='line_9096'>time knight of the Table Round, but he was one of the best knights of</a>
<a id='line_9097'>the world. And so all these noble knights accompanied them with the</a>
<a id='line_9098'>lady of the castle, and with the Red Knight of the Red Launds; but as</a>
<a id='line_9099'>for Sir Gareth, he would not take upon him more but as other mean</a>
<a id='line_9100'>knights.</a>
<a id='line_9101'></a>
<a id='line_9102'></a>
<a id='line_9103'></a>
<a id='line_9104'>CHAPTER XXVII. How King Arthur went to the tournament with his knights,</a>
<a id='line_9105'>and how the lady received him worshipfully, and how the knights</a>
<a id='line_9106'>encountered.</a>
<a id='line_9107'></a>
<a id='line_9108'>And then there came with King Arthur Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_9109'>his brethren. And then his nephews Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9110'>Aglovale, Sir Tor, Sir Percivale de Galis, and Sir Lamorak de Galis.</a>
<a id='line_9111'>Then came Sir Launcelot du Lake with his brethren, nephews, and</a>
<a id='line_9112'>cousins, as Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9113'>Galihodin, Sir Galihud, and many more of Sir Launcelot’s blood, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9114'>Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, his brother, a good knight, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9115'>Sagramore, a good knight; and all the most part of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_9116'>Also there came with King Arthur these knights, the King of Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9117'>King Agwisance, and the King of Scotland, King Carados and King Uriens</a>
<a id='line_9118'>of the land of Gore, and King Bagdemagus and his son Sir Meliaganus,</a>
<a id='line_9119'>and Sir Galahault the noble prince. All these kings, princes, and</a>
<a id='line_9120'>earls, barons, and other noble knights, as Sir Brandiles, Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_9121'>les Avoutres, and Sir Kay, Sir Bedivere, Sir Meliot de Logres, Sir</a>
<a id='line_9122'>Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir Godelake: all these came with King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_9123'>and more that cannot be rehearsed.</a>
<a id='line_9124'></a>
<a id='line_9125'>Now leave we of these kings and knights, and let us speak of the great</a>
<a id='line_9126'>array that was made within the castle and about the castle for both</a>
<a id='line_9127'>parties. The Lady Dame Lionesse ordained great array upon her part for</a>
<a id='line_9128'>her noble knights, for all manner of lodging and victual that came by</a>
<a id='line_9129'>land and by water, that there lacked nothing for her party, nor for the</a>
<a id='line_9130'>other, but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for King</a>
<a id='line_9131'>Arthur and his knights. And then there came the harbingers from King</a>
<a id='line_9132'>Arthur for to harbour him, and his kings, dukes, earls, barons, and</a>
<a id='line_9133'>knights. And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lionesse and the Red Knight of</a>
<a id='line_9134'>the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother, and Sir Gringamore,</a>
<a id='line_9135'>that in no wise there should none of them tell not his name, and make</a>
<a id='line_9136'>no more of him than of the least knight that there was, For, he said, I</a>
<a id='line_9137'>will not be known of neither more nor less, neither at the beginning</a>
<a id='line_9138'>neither at the ending. Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth: Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_9139'>will lend you a ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let</a>
<a id='line_9140'>me have it again when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseth</a>
<a id='line_9141'>my beauty much more than it is of himself. And the virtue of my ring is</a>
<a id='line_9142'>that, that is green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn</a>
<a id='line_9143'>in likeness to green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of</a>
<a id='line_9144'>white, and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it</a>
<a id='line_9145'>will do of all manner of colours. Also who that beareth my ring shall</a>
<a id='line_9146'>lose no blood, and for great love I will give you this ring. Gramercy,</a>
<a id='line_9147'>said Sir Gareth, mine own lady, for this ring is passing meet for me,</a>
<a id='line_9148'>for it will turn all manner of likeness that I am in, and that shall</a>
<a id='line_9149'>cause me that I shall not be known. Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth</a>
<a id='line_9150'>a bay courser that was a passing good horse; also he gave him good</a>
<a id='line_9151'>armour and sure, and a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore’s</a>
<a id='line_9152'>father won upon an heathen tyrant. And so thus every knight made him</a>
<a id='line_9153'>ready to that tournament. And King Arthur was come two days to-fore the</a>
<a id='line_9154'>Assumption of our Lady. And there was all manner of royalty of all</a>
<a id='line_9155'>minstrelsy that might be found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the</a>
<a id='line_9156'>Queen of Orkney, Sir Gareth’s mother.</a>
<a id='line_9157'></a>
<a id='line_9158'>And upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were done, there were</a>
<a id='line_9159'>heralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field. And so there came</a>
<a id='line_9160'>out Sir Epinogrus, the king’s son of Northumberland, from the castle,</a>
<a id='line_9161'>and there encountered with him Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and either of</a>
<a id='line_9162'>them brake their spears to their hands. And then came in Sir Palamides</a>
<a id='line_9163'>out of the castle, and there encountered with him Gawaine, and either</a>
<a id='line_9164'>of them smote other so hard that both the good knights and their horses</a>
<a id='line_9165'>fell to the earth. And then knights of either party rescued their</a>
<a id='line_9166'>knights. And then came in Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides, brethren to</a>
<a id='line_9167'>Sir Palamides; and there encountered Sir Agravaine with Sir Safere and</a>
<a id='line_9168'>Sir Gaheris encountered with Sir Segwarides. So Sir Safere smote down</a>
<a id='line_9169'>Agravaine, Sir Gawaine’s brother; and Sir Segwarides, Sir Safere’s</a>
<a id='line_9170'>brother. And Sir Malegrine, a knight of the castle, encountered with</a>
<a id='line_9171'>Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and there Sir Uwaine gave Sir Malegrine a</a>
<a id='line_9172'>fall, that he had almost broke his neck.</a>
<a id='line_9173'></a>
<a id='line_9174'></a>
<a id='line_9175'></a>
<a id='line_9176'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How the knights bare them in the battle.</a>
<a id='line_9177'></a>
<a id='line_9178'>Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummursum, knights of the</a>
<a id='line_9179'>castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale, and Sir Tor smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_9180'>Grummore Grummursum to the earth. Then came in Sir Carados of the</a>
<a id='line_9181'>dolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle; and there</a>
<a id='line_9182'>encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis,</a>
<a id='line_9183'>that were two brethren. And there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir</a>
<a id='line_9184'>Carados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9185'>Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other’s horse</a>
<a id='line_9186'>and all to the earth, and either parties rescued other, and horsed them</a>
<a id='line_9187'>again. And Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,</a>
<a id='line_9188'>encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights</a>
<a id='line_9189'>encountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands. Then came</a>
<a id='line_9190'>in Sir Tristram, Sir Sadok, and Sir Dinas, knights of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_9191'>there encountered Sir Tristram with Sir Bedivere, and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_9192'>Bedivere was smitten to the earth both horse and man. And Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_9193'>encountered with Sir Petipase, and there Sir Sadok was overthrown. And</a>
<a id='line_9194'>there Uwaine les Avoutres smote down Sir Dinas, the Seneschal. Then</a>
<a id='line_9195'>came in Sir Persant of Inde, a knight of the castle, and there</a>
<a id='line_9196'>encountered with him Sir Launcelot du Lake, and there he smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_9197'>Persant, horse and man, to the earth. Then came Sir Pertolepe from the</a>
<a id='line_9198'>castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel, and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_9199'>Pertolepe, the Green Knight, smote down Sir Lionel, brother to Sir</a>
<a id='line_9200'>Launcelot. All this was marked by noble heralds, who bare him best, and</a>
<a id='line_9201'>their names.</a>
<a id='line_9202'></a>
<a id='line_9203'>And then came into the field Sir Perimones, the Red Knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_9204'>Persant’s brother, that was a knight of the castle, and he encountered</a>
<a id='line_9205'>with Sir Ector de Maris, and either smote other so hard that both their</a>
<a id='line_9206'>horses and they fell to the earth. And then came in the Red Knight of</a>
<a id='line_9207'>the Red Launds, and Sir Gareth, from the castle, and there encountered</a>
<a id='line_9208'>with them Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Bleoberis, and there the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9209'>and Sir Bors [either] smote other so hard that their spears brast, and</a>
<a id='line_9210'>their horses fell grovelling to the earth. Then Sir Bleoberis brake his</a>
<a id='line_9211'>spear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleoberis fell to the</a>
<a id='line_9212'>earth. When Sir Galihodin saw that he bade Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9213'>Gareth smote him to the earth. Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge</a>
<a id='line_9214'>his brother, and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9215'>Dinadan and his brother, La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_9216'>Desirous, and Sir Dodinas le Savage. All these he bare down with one</a>
<a id='line_9217'>spear.</a>
<a id='line_9218'></a>
<a id='line_9219'>When King Agwisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so, he marvelled</a>
<a id='line_9220'>what he might be that one time seemed green, and another time, at his</a>
<a id='line_9221'>again coming, he seemed blue. And thus at every course that he rode to</a>
<a id='line_9222'>and fro he changed his colour, so that there might neither king nor</a>
<a id='line_9223'>knight have ready cognisance of him. Then Sir Agwisance, the King of</a>
<a id='line_9224'>Ireland, encountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him</a>
<a id='line_9225'>from his horse, saddle and all. And then came King Carados of Scotland,</a>
<a id='line_9226'>and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man. And in the same wise he</a>
<a id='line_9227'>served King Uriens of the land of Gore. And then came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_9228'>Bagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him down, horse and man, to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_9229'>And Bagdemagus’ son, Meliganus, brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily</a>
<a id='line_9230'>and knightly. And then Sir Galahault, the noble prince, cried on high:</a>
<a id='line_9231'>Knight with the many colours, well hast thou jousted; now make thee</a>
<a id='line_9232'>ready that I may joust with thee. Sir Gareth heard him, and he gat a</a>
<a id='line_9233'>great spear, and so they encountered together, and there the prince</a>
<a id='line_9234'>brake his spear; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left side of the</a>
<a id='line_9235'>helm that he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not his</a>
<a id='line_9236'>men recovered him.</a>
<a id='line_9237'></a>
<a id='line_9238'>So God me help, said King Arthur, that same knight with the many</a>
<a id='line_9239'>colours is a good knight. Wherefore the king called unto him Sir</a>
<a id='line_9240'>Launcelot, and prayed him to encounter with that knight. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_9241'>Launcelot, I may well find in my heart for to forbear him as at this</a>
<a id='line_9242'>time, for he hath had travail enough this day; and when a good knight</a>
<a id='line_9243'>doth so well upon some day, it is no good knight’s part to let him of</a>
<a id='line_9244'>his worship, and namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great</a>
<a id='line_9245'>labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his quarrel is here this</a>
<a id='line_9246'>day, and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be</a>
<a id='line_9247'>here; for I see well he paineth him and enforceth him to do great</a>
<a id='line_9248'>deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall</a>
<a id='line_9249'>have the honour; though it lay in my power to put him from it I would</a>
<a id='line_9250'>not.</a>
<a id='line_9251'></a>
<a id='line_9252'></a>
<a id='line_9253'></a>
<a id='line_9254'>CHAPTER XXIX. Yet of the said tournament.</a>
<a id='line_9255'></a>
<a id='line_9256'>Then when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then there</a>
<a id='line_9257'>began a sore tournament. And there did Sir Lamorak marvellous deeds of</a>
<a id='line_9258'>arms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir Ironside, that was the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9259'>of the Red Launds, there was strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palamides</a>
<a id='line_9260'>and Bleoberis there was a strong battle; and Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9261'>Tristram met, and there Sir Gawaine had the worse, for he pulled Sir</a>
<a id='line_9262'>Gawaine from his horse, and there he was long upon foot, and defouled.</a>
<a id='line_9263'>Then came in Sir Launcelot, and he smote Sir Turquine, and he him; and</a>
<a id='line_9264'>then came Sir Carados his brother, and both at once they assailed him,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>and he as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with</a>
<a id='line_9266'>them both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of Sir Launcelot. And</a>
<a id='line_9267'>then came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was Sir Launcelot that fought</a>
<a id='line_9268'>with the two perilous knights. And then Sir Gareth came with his good</a>
<a id='line_9269'>horse and hurtled them in-sunder, and no stroke would he smite to Sir</a>
<a id='line_9270'>Launcelot. That espied Sir Launcelot, and deemed it should be the good</a>
<a id='line_9271'>knight Sir Gareth: and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and smote</a>
<a id='line_9272'>on the right hand and on the left hand, and all the folk might well</a>
<a id='line_9273'>espy where that he rode. And by fortune he met with his brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_9274'>Gawaine, and there he put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he put off his</a>
<a id='line_9275'>helm, and so he served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all</a>
<a id='line_9276'>men said he put him in the most pain, and best he did his devoir. For</a>
<a id='line_9277'>when Sir Tristram beheld him how he first jousted and after fought so</a>
<a id='line_9278'>well with a sword, then he rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of</a>
<a id='line_9279'>Inde, and asked them, by their faith, What manner a knight is yonder</a>
<a id='line_9280'>knight that seemeth in so many divers colours? Truly, meseemeth, said</a>
<a id='line_9281'>Tristram, that he putteth himself in great pain, for he never ceaseth.</a>
<a id='line_9282'>Wot ye not what he is? said Sir Ironside. No, said Sir Tristram. Then</a>
<a id='line_9283'>shall ye know that this is he that loveth the lady of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_9284'>she him again; and this is he that won me when I besieged the lady of</a>
<a id='line_9285'>this castle, and this is he that won Sir Persant of Inde, and his three</a>
<a id='line_9286'>brethren. What is his name, said Sir Tristram, and of what blood is he</a>
<a id='line_9287'>come? He was called in the court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his</a>
<a id='line_9288'>right name is Sir Gareth of Orkney, brother to Sir Gawaine. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_9289'>said Sir Tristram, he is a good knight, and a big man of arms, and if</a>
<a id='line_9290'>he be young he shall prove a full noble knight. He is but a child, they</a>
<a id='line_9291'>all said, and of Sir Launcelot he was made knight. Therefore he is</a>
<a id='line_9292'>mickle the better, said Tristram. And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside,</a>
<a id='line_9293'>Sir Persant, and his brother, rode together for to help Sir Gareth; and</a>
<a id='line_9294'>then there were given many strong strokes.</a>
<a id='line_9295'></a>
<a id='line_9296'>And then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm; and</a>
<a id='line_9297'>then said his dwarf: Take me your ring, that ye lose it not while that</a>
<a id='line_9298'>ye drink. And so when he had drunk he gat on his helm, and eagerly took</a>
<a id='line_9299'>his horse and rode into the field, and left his ring with his dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_9300'>and the dwarf was glad the ring was from him, for then he wist well he</a>
<a id='line_9301'>should be known. And then when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks</a>
<a id='line_9302'>saw him well and plainly that he was in yellow colours; and there he</a>
<a id='line_9303'>rased off helms and pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel</a>
<a id='line_9304'>what knight he was, for the king saw by his hair that it was the same</a>
<a id='line_9305'>knight.</a>
<a id='line_9306'></a>
<a id='line_9307'></a>
<a id='line_9308'></a>
<a id='line_9309'>CHAPTER XXX. How Sir Gareth was espied by the heralds, and how he</a>
<a id='line_9310'>escaped out of the field.</a>
<a id='line_9311'></a>
<a id='line_9312'>But before he was in so many colours, and now he is but in one colour;</a>
<a id='line_9313'>that is yellow. Now go, said King Arthur unto divers heralds, and ride</a>
<a id='line_9314'>about him, and espy what manner knight he is, for I have spered of many</a>
<a id='line_9315'>knights this day that be upon his party, and all say they know him not.</a>
<a id='line_9316'></a>
<a id='line_9317'>And so an herald rode nigh Gareth as he could; and there he saw written</a>
<a id='line_9318'>about his helm in gold, This helm is Sir Gareth of Orkney.</a>
<a id='line_9319'></a>
<a id='line_9320'>Then the herald cried as he were wood, and many heralds with him:—This</a>
<a id='line_9321'>is Sir Gareth of Orkney in the yellow arms; that by all kings and</a>
<a id='line_9322'>knights of Arthur’s beheld him and awaited; and then they pressed all</a>
<a id='line_9323'>to behold him, and ever the heralds cried: This is Sir Gareth of</a>
<a id='line_9324'>Orkney, King Lot’s son.</a>
<a id='line_9325'></a>
<a id='line_9326'>And when Sir Gareth espied that he was discovered, then he doubled his</a>
<a id='line_9327'>strokes, and smote down Sir Sagramore, and his brother Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_9328'></a>
<a id='line_9329'>O brother, said Sir Gawaine, I weened ye would not have stricken me.</a>
<a id='line_9330'></a>
<a id='line_9331'>So when he heard him say so he thrang here and there, and so with great</a>
<a id='line_9332'>pain he gat out of the press, and there he met with his dwarf. O boy,</a>
<a id='line_9333'>said Sir Gareth, thou hast beguiled me foul this day that thou kept my</a>
<a id='line_9334'>ring; give it me anon again, that I may hide my body withal; and so he</a>
<a id='line_9335'>took it him. And then they all wist not where he was become; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9336'>Gawaine had in manner espied where Sir Gareth rode, and then he rode</a>
<a id='line_9337'>after with all his might. That espied Sir Gareth, and rode lightly into</a>
<a id='line_9338'>the forest, that Sir Gawaine wist not where he was become. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_9339'>Gareth wist that Sir Gawaine was passed, he asked the dwarf of best</a>
<a id='line_9340'>counsel. Sir, said the dwarf, meseemeth it were best, now that ye are</a>
<a id='line_9341'>escaped from spying, that ye send my lady Dame Lionesse her ring. It is</a>
<a id='line_9342'>well advised, said Sir Gareth; now have it here and bear it to her, and</a>
<a id='line_9343'>say that I recommend me unto her good grace, and say her I will come</a>
<a id='line_9344'>when I may, and I pray her to be true and faithful to me as I will be</a>
<a id='line_9345'>to her. Sir, said the dwarf, it shall be done as ye command: and so he</a>
<a id='line_9346'>rode his way, and did his errand unto the lady. Then she said, Where is</a>
<a id='line_9347'>my knight, Sir Gareth? Madam, said the dwarf, he bade me say that he</a>
<a id='line_9348'>would not be long from you. And so lightly the dwarf came again unto</a>
<a id='line_9349'>Sir Gareth, that would full fain have had a lodging, for he had need to</a>
<a id='line_9350'>be reposed. And then fell there a thunder and a rain, as heaven and</a>
<a id='line_9351'>earth should go together. And Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for of</a>
<a id='line_9352'>all that day he had but little rest, neither his horse nor he. So this</a>
<a id='line_9353'>Sir Gareth rode so long in that forest until the night came. And ever</a>
<a id='line_9354'>it lightened and thundered, as it had been wood. At the last by fortune</a>
<a id='line_9355'>he came to a castle, and there he heard the waits upon the walls.</a>
<a id='line_9356'></a>
<a id='line_9357'></a>
<a id='line_9358'></a>
<a id='line_9359'>CHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Gareth came to a castle where he was well lodged,</a>
<a id='line_9360'>and he jousted with a knight and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_9361'></a>
<a id='line_9362'>Then Sir Gareth rode unto the barbican of the castle, and prayed the</a>
<a id='line_9363'>porter fair to let him into the castle. The porter answered ungoodly</a>
<a id='line_9364'>again, and said, Thou gettest no lodging here. Fair sir, say not so,</a>
<a id='line_9365'>for I am a knight of King Arthur’s, and pray the lord or the lady of</a>
<a id='line_9366'>this castle to give me harbour for the love of King Arthur. Then the</a>
<a id='line_9367'>porter went unto the duchess, and told her how there was a knight of</a>
<a id='line_9368'>King Arthur’s would have harbour. Let him in, said the duchess, for I</a>
<a id='line_9369'>will see that knight, and for King Arthur’s sake he shall not be</a>
<a id='line_9370'>harbourless. Then she yode up into a tower over the gate, with great</a>
<a id='line_9371'>torchlight.</a>
<a id='line_9372'></a>
<a id='line_9373'>When Sir Gareth saw that torch-light he cried on high: Whether thou be</a>
<a id='line_9374'>lord or lady, giant or champion, I take no force so that I may have</a>
<a id='line_9375'>harbour this night; and if it so be that I must needs fight, spare me</a>
<a id='line_9376'>not to-morn when I have rested me, for both I and mine horse be weary.</a>
<a id='line_9377'>Sir knight, said the lady, thou speakest knightly and boldly; but wit</a>
<a id='line_9378'>thou well the lord of this castle loveth not King Arthur, nor none of</a>
<a id='line_9379'>his court, for my lord hath ever been against him; and therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_9380'>were better not to come within this castle; for an thou come in this</a>
<a id='line_9381'>night, thou must come in under such form, that wheresomever thou meet</a>
<a id='line_9382'>my lord, by stigh or by street, thou must yield thee to him as</a>
<a id='line_9383'>prisoner. Madam, said Sir Gareth, what is your lord, and what is his</a>
<a id='line_9384'>name? Sir, my lord’s name is the Duke de la Rowse. Well madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9385'>Gareth, I shall promise you in what place I meet your lord I shall</a>
<a id='line_9386'>yield me unto him and to his good grace; with that I understand he will</a>
<a id='line_9387'>do me no harm: and if I understand that he will, I will release myself</a>
<a id='line_9388'>an I can with my spear and my sword. Ye say well, said the duchess; and</a>
<a id='line_9389'>then she let the drawbridge down, and so he rode into the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_9390'>there he alighted, and his horse was led into a stable; and in the hall</a>
<a id='line_9391'>he unarmed him and said, Madam, I will not out of this hall this night;</a>
<a id='line_9392'>and when it is daylight, let see who will have ado with me, he shall</a>
<a id='line_9393'>find me ready. Then was he set unto supper, and had many good dishes.</a>
<a id='line_9394'>Then Sir Gareth list well to eat, and knightly he ate his meat, and</a>
<a id='line_9395'>eagerly; there was many a fair lady by him, and some said they never</a>
<a id='line_9396'>saw a goodlier man nor so well of eating. Then they made him passing</a>
<a id='line_9397'>good cheer, and shortly when he had supped his bed was made there; so</a>
<a id='line_9398'>he rested him all night.</a>
<a id='line_9399'></a>
<a id='line_9400'>And on the morn he heard mass, and brake his fast and took his leave at</a>
<a id='line_9401'>the duchess, and at them all; and thanked her goodly of her lodging,</a>
<a id='line_9402'>and of his good cheer; and then she asked him his name. Madam, he said,</a>
<a id='line_9403'>truly my name is Gareth of Orkney, and some men call me Beaumains. Then</a>
<a id='line_9404'>knew she well it was the same knight that fought for Dame Lionesse. So</a>
<a id='line_9405'>Sir Gareth departed and rode up into a mountain, and there met him a</a>
<a id='line_9406'>knight, his name was Sir Bendelaine, and said to Sir Gareth: Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_9407'>not pass this way, for either thou shalt joust with me, or else be my</a>
<a id='line_9408'>prisoner. Then will I joust, said Sir Gareth. And so they let their</a>
<a id='line_9409'>horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote him throughout the body; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9410'>Bendelaine rode forth to his castle there beside, and there died. So</a>
<a id='line_9411'>Sir Gareth would have rested him, and he came riding to Bendelaine’s</a>
<a id='line_9412'>castle. Then his knights and servants espied that it was he that had</a>
<a id='line_9413'>slain their lord. Then they armed twenty good men, and came out and</a>
<a id='line_9414'>assailed Sir Gareth; and so he had no spear, but his sword, and put his</a>
<a id='line_9415'>shield afore him; and there they brake their spears upon him, and they</a>
<a id='line_9416'>assailed him passingly sore. But ever Sir Gareth defended him as a</a>
<a id='line_9417'>knight.</a>
<a id='line_9418'></a>
<a id='line_9419'></a>
<a id='line_9420'></a>
<a id='line_9421'>CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Gareth fought with a knight that held within his</a>
<a id='line_9422'>castle thirty ladies, and how he slew him.</a>
<a id='line_9423'></a>
<a id='line_9424'>So when they saw that they might not overcome him, they rode from him,</a>
<a id='line_9425'>and took their counsel to slay his horse; and so they came in upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_9426'>Gareth, and with spears they slew his horse, and then they assailed him</a>
<a id='line_9427'>hard. But when he was on foot, there was none that he fought but he</a>
<a id='line_9428'>gave him such a buffet that he did never recover. So he slew them by</a>
<a id='line_9429'>one and one till they were but four, and there they fled; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9430'>Gareth took a good horse that was one of theirs, and rode his way.</a>
<a id='line_9431'></a>
<a id='line_9432'>Then he rode a great pace till that he came to a castle, and there he</a>
<a id='line_9433'>heard much mourning of ladies and gentlewomen. So there came by him a</a>
<a id='line_9434'>page. What noise is this, said Sir Gareth, that I hear within this</a>
<a id='line_9435'>castle? Sir knight, said the page, here be within this castle thirty</a>
<a id='line_9436'>ladies, and all they be widows; for here is a knight that waiteth daily</a>
<a id='line_9437'>upon this castle, and his name is the Brown Knight without Pity, and he</a>
<a id='line_9438'>is the periloust knight that now liveth; and therefore sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_9439'>page, I rede you flee. Nay, said Sir Gareth, I will not flee though</a>
<a id='line_9440'>thou be afeard of him. And then the page saw where came the Brown</a>
<a id='line_9441'>Knight: Lo, said the page, yonder he cometh. Let me deal with him, said</a>
<a id='line_9442'>Sir Gareth. And when either of other had a sight they let their horses</a>
<a id='line_9443'>run, and the Brown Knight brake his spear, and Sir Gareth smote him</a>
<a id='line_9444'>throughout the body, that he overthrew him to the ground stark dead. So</a>
<a id='line_9445'>Sir Gareth rode into the castle, and prayed the ladies that he might</a>
<a id='line_9446'>repose him. Alas, said the ladies, ye may not be lodged here. Make him</a>
<a id='line_9447'>good cheer, said the page, for this knight hath slain your enemy. Then</a>
<a id='line_9448'>they all made him good cheer as lay in their power. But wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_9449'>they made him good cheer, for they might none otherwise do, for they</a>
<a id='line_9450'>were but poor.</a>
<a id='line_9451'></a>
<a id='line_9452'>And so on the morn he went to mass, and there he saw the thirty ladies</a>
<a id='line_9453'>kneel, and lay grovelling upon divers tombs, making great dole and</a>
<a id='line_9454'>sorrow. Then Sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their lords.</a>
<a id='line_9455'>Fair ladies, said Sir Gareth, ye must at the next feast of Pentecost be</a>
<a id='line_9456'>at the court of King Arthur, and say that I, Sir Gareth, sent you</a>
<a id='line_9457'>thither. We shall do this, said the ladies. So he departed, and by</a>
<a id='line_9458'>fortune he came to a mountain, and there he found a goodly knight that</a>
<a id='line_9459'>bade him, Abide sir knight, and joust with me. What are ye? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9460'>Gareth. My name is, said he, the Duke de la Rowse. Ah sir, ye are the</a>
<a id='line_9461'>same knight that I lodged once in your castle; and there I made promise</a>
<a id='line_9462'>unto your lady that I should yield me unto you. Ah, said the duke, art</a>
<a id='line_9463'>thou that proud knight that profferest to fight with my knights;</a>
<a id='line_9464'>therefore make thee ready, for I will have ado with you. So they let</a>
<a id='line_9465'>their horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote the duke down from his</a>
<a id='line_9466'>horse. But the duke lightly avoided his horse, and dressed his shield</a>
<a id='line_9467'>and drew his sword, and bade Sir Gareth alight and fight with him. So</a>
<a id='line_9468'>he did alight, and they did great battle together more than an hour,</a>
<a id='line_9469'>and either hurt other full sore. At the last Sir Gareth gat the duke to</a>
<a id='line_9470'>the earth, and would have slain him, and then he yield him to him. Then</a>
<a id='line_9471'>must ye go, said Sir Gareth, unto Sir Arthur my lord at the next feast,</a>
<a id='line_9472'>and say that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent you unto him. It shall be</a>
<a id='line_9473'>done, said the duke, and I will do to you homage and fealty with an</a>
<a id='line_9474'>hundred knights with me; and all the days of my life to do you service</a>
<a id='line_9475'>where ye will command me.</a>
<a id='line_9476'></a>
<a id='line_9477'></a>
<a id='line_9478'></a>
<a id='line_9479'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine fought each against</a>
<a id='line_9480'>other, and how they knew each other by the damosel Linet.</a>
<a id='line_9481'></a>
<a id='line_9482'>So the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there he</a>
<a id='line_9483'>saw an armed knight coming toward him. Then Sir Gareth took the duke’s</a>
<a id='line_9484'>shield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without biding they ran</a>
<a id='line_9485'>together as it had been the thunder. And there that knight hurt Sir</a>
<a id='line_9486'>Gareth under the side with his spear. And then they alighted and drew</a>
<a id='line_9487'>their swords, and gave great strokes that the blood trailed to the</a>
<a id='line_9488'>ground. And so they fought two hours.</a>
<a id='line_9489'></a>
<a id='line_9490'>At the last there came the damosel Linet, that some men called the</a>
<a id='line_9491'>damosel Savage, and she came riding upon an ambling mule; and there she</a>
<a id='line_9492'>cried all on high, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave thy fighting with</a>
<a id='line_9493'>thy brother Sir Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_9494'></a>
<a id='line_9495'>And when he heard her say so he threw away his shield and his sword,</a>
<a id='line_9496'>and ran to Sir Gareth, and took him in his arms, and sithen kneeled</a>
<a id='line_9497'>down and asked him mercy.</a>
<a id='line_9498'></a>
<a id='line_9499'>What are ye, said Sir Gareth, that right now were so strong and so</a>
<a id='line_9500'>mighty, and now so suddenly yield you to me? O Gareth, I am your</a>
<a id='line_9501'>brother Sir Gawaine, that for your sake have had great sorrow and</a>
<a id='line_9502'>labour.</a>
<a id='line_9503'></a>
<a id='line_9504'>Then Sir Gareth unlaced his helm, and kneeled down to him, and asked</a>
<a id='line_9505'>him mercy. Then they rose both, and embraced either other in their</a>
<a id='line_9506'>arms, and wept a great while or they might speak, and either of them</a>
<a id='line_9507'>gave other the prize of the battle. And there were many kind words</a>
<a id='line_9508'>between them.</a>
<a id='line_9509'></a>
<a id='line_9510'>Alas, my fair brother, said Sir Gawaine, perdy I owe of right to</a>
<a id='line_9511'>worship you an ye were not my brother, for ye have worshipped King</a>
<a id='line_9512'>Arthur and all his court, for ye have sent me more worshipful knights</a>
<a id='line_9513'>this twelvemonth than six the best of the Round Table have done, except</a>
<a id='line_9514'>Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_9515'></a>
<a id='line_9516'>Then came the damosel Savage that was the Lady Linet, that rode with</a>
<a id='line_9517'>Sir Gareth so long, and there she did staunch Sir Gareth’s wounds and</a>
<a id='line_9518'>Sir Gawaine’s. Now what will ye do? said the damosel Savage; meseemeth</a>
<a id='line_9519'>that it were well done that Arthur had witting of you both, for your</a>
<a id='line_9520'>horses are so bruised that they may not bear. Now, fair damosel, said</a>
<a id='line_9521'>Sir Gawaine, I pray you ride unto my lord mine uncle, King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_9522'>tell him what adventure is to me betid here, and I suppose he will not</a>
<a id='line_9523'>tarry long. Then she took her mule, and lightly she came to King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_9524'>that was but two mile thence. And when she had told him tidings the</a>
<a id='line_9525'>king bade get him a palfrey. And when he was upon his back he bade the</a>
<a id='line_9526'>lords and ladies come after, who that would; and there was saddling and</a>
<a id='line_9527'>bridling of queens’ horses and princes’ horses, and well was him that</a>
<a id='line_9528'>soonest might be ready.</a>
<a id='line_9529'></a>
<a id='line_9530'>So when the king came thereas they were, he saw Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9531'>Gareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided his</a>
<a id='line_9532'>horse. And when he came nigh Sir Gareth he would have spoken but he</a>
<a id='line_9533'>might not; and therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness. And so</a>
<a id='line_9534'>they stert unto their uncle, and required him of his good grace to be</a>
<a id='line_9535'>of good comfort. Wit ye well the king made great joy, and many a</a>
<a id='line_9536'>piteous complaint he made to Sir Gareth, and ever he wept as he had</a>
<a id='line_9537'>been a child. With that came his mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame</a>
<a id='line_9538'>Morgawse, and when she saw Sir Gareth readily in the visage she might</a>
<a id='line_9539'>not weep, but suddenly fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great</a>
<a id='line_9540'>while like as she had been dead. And then Sir Gareth recomforted his</a>
<a id='line_9541'>mother in such wise that she recovered and made good cheer. Then the</a>
<a id='line_9542'>king commanded that all manner of knights that were under his</a>
<a id='line_9543'>obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his</a>
<a id='line_9544'>nephews. And so it was done, and all manner of purveyance purveyed,</a>
<a id='line_9545'>that there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame nor wild for</a>
<a id='line_9546'>gold or silver. And then by the means of the damosel Savage Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_9547'>and Sir Gareth were healed of their wounds; and there they sojourned</a>
<a id='line_9548'>eight days.</a>
<a id='line_9549'></a>
<a id='line_9550'>Then said King Arthur unto the damosel Savage: I marvel that your</a>
<a id='line_9551'>sister, Dame Lionesse, cometh not here to me, and in especial that she</a>
<a id='line_9552'>cometh not to visit her knight, my nephew Sir Gareth, that hath had so</a>
<a id='line_9553'>much travail for her love. My lord, said the damosel Linet, ye must of</a>
<a id='line_9554'>your good grace hold her excused, for she knoweth not that my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_9555'>Gareth, is here. Go then for her, said King Arthur, that we may be</a>
<a id='line_9556'>appointed what is best to be done, according to the pleasure of my</a>
<a id='line_9557'>nephew. Sir, said the damosel, that shall be done, and so she rode unto</a>
<a id='line_9558'>her sister. And as lightly as she might she made her ready; and she</a>
<a id='line_9559'>came on the morn with her brother Sir Gringamore, and with her forty</a>
<a id='line_9560'>knights. And so when she was come she had all the cheer that might be</a>
<a id='line_9561'>done, both of the king, and of many other kings and queens.</a>
<a id='line_9562'></a>
<a id='line_9563'></a>
<a id='line_9564'></a>
<a id='line_9565'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Gareth acknowledged that they loved each other</a>
<a id='line_9566'>to King Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding.</a>
<a id='line_9567'></a>
<a id='line_9568'>And among all these ladies she was named the fairest, and peerless.</a>
<a id='line_9569'>Then when Sir Gawaine saw her there was many a goodly look and goodly</a>
<a id='line_9570'>words, that all men of worship had joy to behold them. Then came King</a>
<a id='line_9571'>Arthur and many other kings, and Dame Guenever, and the Queen of</a>
<a id='line_9572'>Orkney. And there the king asked his nephew, Sir Gareth, whether he</a>
<a id='line_9573'>would have that lady as paramour, or to have her to his wife. My lord,</a>
<a id='line_9574'>wit you well that I love her above all ladies living. Now, fair lady,</a>
<a id='line_9575'>said King Arthur, what say ye? Most noble King, said Dame Lionesse, wit</a>
<a id='line_9576'>you well that my lord, Sir Gareth, is to me more liefer to have and</a>
<a id='line_9577'>wield as my husband, than any king or prince that is christened; and if</a>
<a id='line_9578'>I may not have him I promise you I will never have none. For, my lord</a>
<a id='line_9579'>Arthur, said Dame Lionesse, wit ye well he is my first love, and he</a>
<a id='line_9580'>shall be the last; and if ye will suffer him to have his will and free</a>
<a id='line_9581'>choice I dare say he will have me. That is truth, said Sir Gareth; an I</a>
<a id='line_9582'>have not you and wield not you as my wife, there shall never lady nor</a>
<a id='line_9583'>gentlewoman rejoice me. What, nephew, said the king, is the wind in</a>
<a id='line_9584'>that door? for wit ye well I would not for the stint of my crown to be</a>
<a id='line_9585'>causer to withdraw your hearts; and wit ye well ye cannot love so well</a>
<a id='line_9586'>but I shall rather increase it than distress it. And also ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_9587'>my love and my lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power.</a>
<a id='line_9588'>And in the same wise said Sir Gareth’s mother.</a>
<a id='line_9589'></a>
<a id='line_9590'>Then there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by the</a>
<a id='line_9591'>king’s advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas</a>
<a id='line_9592'>following, at Kink Kenadon by the seaside, for there is a plentiful</a>
<a id='line_9593'>country. And so it was cried in all the places through the realm. And</a>
<a id='line_9594'>then Sir Gareth sent his summons to all these knights and ladies that</a>
<a id='line_9595'>he had won in battle to-fore, that they should be at his day of</a>
<a id='line_9596'>marriage at Kink Kenadon by the sands.</a>
<a id='line_9597'></a>
<a id='line_9598'>And then Dame Lionesse, and the damosel Linet with Sir Gringamore, rode</a>
<a id='line_9599'>to their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring she gave to Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_9600'>and he gave her another. And King Arthur gave her a rich pair of bee of</a>
<a id='line_9601'>gold; and so she departed.</a>
<a id='line_9602'></a>
<a id='line_9603'>And King Arthur and his fellowship rode toward Kink Kenadon, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_9604'>Gareth brought his lady on the way, and so came to the king again and</a>
<a id='line_9605'>rode with him.</a>
<a id='line_9606'></a>
<a id='line_9607'>Lord! the great cheer that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he of</a>
<a id='line_9608'>him, for there was never no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he</a>
<a id='line_9609'>did Sir Launcelot; and ever for the most part he would be in Sir</a>
<a id='line_9610'>Launcelot’s company; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawaine’s</a>
<a id='line_9611'>conditions, he withdrew himself from his brother, Sir Gawaine’s,</a>
<a id='line_9612'>fellowship, for he was vengeable, and where he hated he would be</a>
<a id='line_9613'>avenged with murder, and that hated Sir Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_9614'></a>
<a id='line_9615'></a>
<a id='line_9616'></a>
<a id='line_9617'>CHAPTER XXXV. Of the Great Royalty, and what officers were made at the</a>
<a id='line_9618'>feast of the wedding, and of the jousts at the feast.</a>
<a id='line_9619'></a>
<a id='line_9620'>So it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lionesse, the lady</a>
<a id='line_9621'>of the Castle Perilous, and her sister, Dame Linet, with Sir</a>
<a id='line_9622'>Gringamore, her brother, with them for he had the conduct of these</a>
<a id='line_9623'>ladies. And there they were lodged at the device of King Arthur. And</a>
<a id='line_9624'>upon Michaelmas Day the Bishop of Canterbury made the wedding betwixt</a>
<a id='line_9625'>Sir Gareth and the Lady Lionesse with great solemnity. And King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_9626'>made Gaheris to wed the Damosel Savage, that was Dame Linet; and King</a>
<a id='line_9627'>Arthur made Sir Agravaine to wed Dame Lionesse’s niece, a fair lady,</a>
<a id='line_9628'>her name was Dame Laurel.</a>
<a id='line_9629'></a>
<a id='line_9630'>And so when this solemnization was done, then came in the Green Knight,</a>
<a id='line_9631'>Sir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he did homage and fealty</a>
<a id='line_9632'>to Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him for evermore. Also Sir</a>
<a id='line_9633'>Pertolepe said: I pray you that at this feast I may be your</a>
<a id='line_9634'>chamberlain. With a good will, said Sir Gareth sith it liketh you to</a>
<a id='line_9635'>take so simple an office. Then came in the Red Knight, with three score</a>
<a id='line_9636'>knights with him, and did to Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all</a>
<a id='line_9637'>those knights to hold of him for evermore. And then this Sir Perimones</a>
<a id='line_9638'>prayed Sir Gareth to grant him to be his chief butler at that high</a>
<a id='line_9639'>feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have this office, and it</a>
<a id='line_9640'>were better. Then came in Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred knights</a>
<a id='line_9641'>with him, and there he did homage and fealty, and all his knights</a>
<a id='line_9642'>should do him service, and hold their lands of him for ever; and there</a>
<a id='line_9643'>he prayed Sir Gareth to make him his sewer-chief at the feast. I will</a>
<a id='line_9644'>well, said Sir Gareth, that ye have it and it were better. Then came</a>
<a id='line_9645'>the Duke de la Rowse with an hundred knights with him, and there he did</a>
<a id='line_9646'>homage and fealty to Sir Gareth, and so to hold their lands of him for</a>
<a id='line_9647'>ever. And he required Sir Gareth that he might serve him of the wine</a>
<a id='line_9648'>that day of that feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, and it were</a>
<a id='line_9649'>better. Then came in the Red Knight of the Red Launds, that was Sir</a>
<a id='line_9650'>Ironside, and he brought with him three hundred knights, and there he</a>
<a id='line_9651'>did homage and fealty, and all these knights to hold their lands of him</a>
<a id='line_9652'>for ever. And then he asked Sir Gareth to be his carver. I will well,</a>
<a id='line_9653'>said Sir Gareth, an it please you.</a>
<a id='line_9654'></a>
<a id='line_9655'>Then came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed widows, and</a>
<a id='line_9656'>those thirty ladies brought with them many fair gentlewomen. And all</a>
<a id='line_9657'>they kneeled down at once unto King Arthur and unto Sir Gareth, and</a>
<a id='line_9658'>there all those ladies told the king how Sir Gareth delivered them from</a>
<a id='line_9659'>the dolorous tower, and slew the Brown Knight without Pity: And</a>
<a id='line_9660'>therefore we, and our heirs for evermore, will do homage unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_9661'>Gareth of Orkney. So then the kings and queens, princes and earls,</a>
<a id='line_9662'>barons and many bold knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there</a>
<a id='line_9663'>were all manner of meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with</a>
<a id='line_9664'>all manner of minstrelsy that was used in those days. Also there was</a>
<a id='line_9665'>great jousts three days. But the king would not suffer Sir Gareth to</a>
<a id='line_9666'>joust, because of his new bride; for, as the French book saith, that</a>
<a id='line_9667'>Dame Lionesse desired of the king that none that were wedded should</a>
<a id='line_9668'>joust at that feast.</a>
<a id='line_9669'></a>
<a id='line_9670'>So the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Galis, for he overthrew</a>
<a id='line_9671'>thirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of arms; and then</a>
<a id='line_9672'>King Arthur made Sir Persant and his two brethren Knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_9673'>Table to their lives’ end, and gave them great lands. Also the second</a>
<a id='line_9674'>day there jousted Tristram best, and he overthrew forty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_9675'>did there marvellous deeds of arms. And there King Arthur made</a>
<a id='line_9676'>Ironside, that was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, a Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_9677'>Table Round to his life’s end, and gave him great lands. The third day</a>
<a id='line_9678'>there jousted Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he overthrew fifty knights,</a>
<a id='line_9679'>and did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on him.</a>
<a id='line_9680'>And there King Arthur made the Duke de la Rowse a Knight of the Round</a>
<a id='line_9681'>Table to his life’s end, and gave him great lands to spend. But when</a>
<a id='line_9682'>these jousts were done, Sir Lamorak and Sir Tristram departed suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_9683'>and would not be known, for the which King Arthur and all the court</a>
<a id='line_9684'>were sore displeased. And so they held the court forty days with great</a>
<a id='line_9685'>solemnity. And this Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a well-ruled,</a>
<a id='line_9686'>and fair-languaged.</a>
<a id='line_9687'></a>
<a id='line_9688'>Thus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that wedded Dame Lionesse</a>
<a id='line_9689'>of the Castle Perilous. And also Sir Gaheris wedded her sister, Dame</a>
<a id='line_9690'>Linet, that was called the Damosel Sabage. And Sir Agrabaine wedded</a>
<a id='line_9691'>Dame Laurel, a fair lady and great, and mighty lands with great riches</a>
<a id='line_9692'>gave with them King Arthur, that royally they might live till their</a>
<a id='line_9693'>lives’ end.</a>

<a id='line_9695'> Here followeth the viii. book, the which is the first book of Sir</a>
<a id='line_9696'> Tristram de Liones, and who was his father and his mother, and how he</a>
<a id='line_9697'> was born and fostered, and how he was made knight.</a>

<a id='line_9701'>BOOK VIII.</a>
<a id='line_9702'></a>
<a id='line_9703'></a>
<a id='line_9704'></a>
<a id='line_9705'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Tristram de Liones was born, and how his mother died</a>
<a id='line_9706'>at his birth, wherefore she named him Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_9707'></a>
<a id='line_9708'>It was a king that hight Meliodas, and he was lord and king of the</a>
<a id='line_9709'>country of Liones, and this Meliodas was a likely knight as any was</a>
<a id='line_9710'>that time living. And by fortune he wedded King Mark’s sister of</a>
<a id='line_9711'>Cornwall, and she was called Elizabeth, that was called both good and</a>
<a id='line_9712'>fair. And at that time King Arthur reigned, and he was whole king of</a>
<a id='line_9713'>England, Wales, and Scotland, and of many other realms: howbeit there</a>
<a id='line_9714'>were many kings that were lords of many countries, but all they held</a>
<a id='line_9715'>their lands of King Arthur; for in Wales were two kings, and in the</a>
<a id='line_9716'>north were many kings; and in Cornwall and in the west were two kings;</a>
<a id='line_9717'>also in Ireland were two or three kings, and all were under the</a>
<a id='line_9718'>obeissance of King Arthur. So was the King of France, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_9719'>Brittany, and all the lordships unto Rome.</a>
<a id='line_9720'></a>
<a id='line_9721'>So when this King Meliodas had been with his wife, within a while she</a>
<a id='line_9722'>waxed great with child, and she was a full meek lady, and well she</a>
<a id='line_9723'>loved her lord, and he her again, so there was great joy betwixt them.</a>
<a id='line_9724'>Then there was a lady in that country that had loved King Meliodas</a>
<a id='line_9725'>long, and by no mean she never could get his love; therefore she let</a>
<a id='line_9726'>ordain upon a day, as King Meliodas rode a-hunting, for he was a great</a>
<a id='line_9727'>chaser, and there by an enchantment she made him chase an hart by</a>
<a id='line_9728'>himself alone till that he came to an old castle, and there anon he was</a>
<a id='line_9729'>taken prisoner by the lady that him loved. When Elizabeth, King</a>
<a id='line_9730'>Meliodas’ wife, missed her lord, and she was nigh out of her wit, and</a>
<a id='line_9731'>also as great with child as she was, she took a gentlewoman with her,</a>
<a id='line_9732'>and ran into the forest to seek her lord. And when she was far in the</a>
<a id='line_9733'>forest she might no farther, for she began to travail fast of her</a>
<a id='line_9734'>child. And she had many grimly throes; her gentlewoman helped her all</a>
<a id='line_9735'>that she might, and so by miracle of Our Lady of Heaven she was</a>
<a id='line_9736'>delivered with great pains. But she had taken such cold for the default</a>
<a id='line_9737'>of help that deep draughts of death took her, that needs she must die</a>
<a id='line_9738'>and depart out of this world; there was none other bote.</a>
<a id='line_9739'></a>
<a id='line_9740'>And when this Queen Elizabeth saw that there was none other bote, then</a>
<a id='line_9741'>she made great dole, and said unto her gentlewoman: When ye see my</a>
<a id='line_9742'>lord, King Meliodas, recommend me unto him, and tell him what pains I</a>
<a id='line_9743'>endure here for his love, and how I must die here for his sake for</a>
<a id='line_9744'>default of good help; and let him wit that I am full sorry to depart</a>
<a id='line_9745'>out of this world from him, therefore pray him to be friend to my soul.</a>
<a id='line_9746'>Now let me see my little child, for whom I have had all this sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_9747'>And when she saw him she said thus: Ah, my little son, thou hast</a>
<a id='line_9748'>murdered thy mother, and therefore I suppose, thou that art a murderer</a>
<a id='line_9749'>so young, thou art full likely to be a manly man in thine age. And</a>
<a id='line_9750'>because I shall die of the birth of thee, I charge thee, gentlewoman,</a>
<a id='line_9751'>that thou pray my lord, King Meliodas, that when he is christened let</a>
<a id='line_9752'>call him Tristram, that is as much to say as a sorrowful birth. And</a>
<a id='line_9753'>therewith this queen gave up the ghost and died. Then the gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_9754'>laid her under an umbre of a great tree, and then she lapped the child</a>
<a id='line_9755'>as well as she might for cold. Right so there came the barons,</a>
<a id='line_9756'>following after the queen, and when they saw that she was dead, and</a>
<a id='line_9757'>understood none other but the king was destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_9758'></a>
<a id='line_9759'></a>
<a id='line_9760'></a>
<a id='line_9761'>CHAPTER II. How the stepmother of Sir Tristram had ordained poison for</a>
<a id='line_9762'>to have poisoned Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_9763'></a>
<a id='line_9764'>Then certain of them would have slain the child, because they would</a>
<a id='line_9765'>have been lords of the country of Liones. But then through the fair</a>
<a id='line_9766'>speech of the gentlewoman, and by the means that she made, the most</a>
<a id='line_9767'>part of the barons would not assent thereto. And then they let carry</a>
<a id='line_9768'>home the dead queen, and much dole was made for her.</a>
<a id='line_9769'></a>
<a id='line_9770'>Then this meanwhile Merlin delivered King Meliodas out of prison on the</a>
<a id='line_9771'>morn after his queen was dead. And so when the king was come home the</a>
<a id='line_9772'>most part of the barons made great joy. But the sorrow that the king</a>
<a id='line_9773'>made for his queen that might no tongue tell. So then the king let</a>
<a id='line_9774'>inter her richly, and after he let christen his child as his wife had</a>
<a id='line_9775'>commanded afore her death. And then he let call him Tristram, the</a>
<a id='line_9776'>sorrowful born child. Then the King Meliodas endured seven years</a>
<a id='line_9777'>without a wife, and all this time Tristram was nourished well. Then it</a>
<a id='line_9778'>befell that King Meliodas wedded King Howell’s daughter of Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_9779'>and anon she had children of King Meliodas: then was she heavy and</a>
<a id='line_9780'>wroth that her children should not rejoice the country of Liones,</a>
<a id='line_9781'>wherefore this queen ordained for to poison young Tristram. So she let</a>
<a id='line_9782'>poison be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_9783'>her children were together, unto that intent that when Tristram were</a>
<a id='line_9784'>thirsty he should drink that drink. And so it fell upon a day, the</a>
<a id='line_9785'>queen’s son, as he was in that chamber, espied the piece with poison,</a>
<a id='line_9786'>and he weened it had been good drink, and because the child was thirsty</a>
<a id='line_9787'>he took the piece with poison and drank freely; and therewithal</a>
<a id='line_9788'>suddenly the child brast and was dead.</a>
<a id='line_9789'></a>
<a id='line_9790'>When the queen of Meliodas wist of the death of her son, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_9791'>that she was heavy. But yet the king understood nothing of her treason.</a>
<a id='line_9792'>Notwithstanding the queen would not leave this, but eft she let ordain</a>
<a id='line_9793'>more poison, and put it in a piece. And by fortune King Meliodas, her</a>
<a id='line_9794'>husband, found the piece with wine where was the poison, and he that</a>
<a id='line_9795'>was much thirsty took the piece for to drink thereout. And as he would</a>
<a id='line_9796'>have drunken thereof the queen espied him, and then she ran unto him,</a>
<a id='line_9797'>and pulled the piece from him suddenly. The king marvelled why she did</a>
<a id='line_9798'>so, and remembered him how her son was suddenly slain with poison. And</a>
<a id='line_9799'>then he took her by the hand, and said: Thou false traitress, thou</a>
<a id='line_9800'>shalt tell me what manner of drink this is, or else I shall slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_9801'>And therewith he pulled out his sword, and sware a great oath that he</a>
<a id='line_9802'>should slay her but if she told him truth. Ah! mercy, my lord, said</a>
<a id='line_9803'>she, and I shall tell you all. And then she told him why she would have</a>
<a id='line_9804'>slain Tristram, because her children should rejoice his land. Well,</a>
<a id='line_9805'>said King Meliodas, and therefore shall ye have the law. And so she was</a>
<a id='line_9806'>condemned by the assent of the barons to be burnt; and then was there</a>
<a id='line_9807'>made a great fire, and right as she was at the fire to take her</a>
<a id='line_9808'>execution, young Tristram kneeled afore King Meliodas, and besought him</a>
<a id='line_9809'>to give him a boon. I will well, said the king again. Then said young</a>
<a id='line_9810'>Tristram, Give me the life of thy queen, my stepmother. That is</a>
<a id='line_9811'>unrightfully asked, said King Meliodas, for thou ought of right to hate</a>
<a id='line_9812'>her, for she would have slain thee with that poison an she might have</a>
<a id='line_9813'>had her will; and for thy sake most is my cause that she should die.</a>
<a id='line_9814'></a>
<a id='line_9815'>Sir, said Tristram, as for that, I beseech you of your mercy that you</a>
<a id='line_9816'>will forgive it her, and as for my part, God forgive it her, and I do;</a>
<a id='line_9817'>and so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon, for God’s love</a>
<a id='line_9818'>I require you hold your promise. Sithen it is so, said the king, I will</a>
<a id='line_9819'>that ye have her life. Then, said the king, I give her to you, and go</a>
<a id='line_9820'>ye to the fire and take her, and do with her what ye will. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_9821'>Tristram went to the fire, and by the commandment of the king delivered</a>
<a id='line_9822'>her from the death. But after that King Meliodas would never have ado</a>
<a id='line_9823'>with her, as at bed and board. But by the good means of young Tristram</a>
<a id='line_9824'>he made the king and her accorded. But then the king would not suffer</a>
<a id='line_9825'>young Tristram to abide no longer in his court.</a>
<a id='line_9826'></a>
<a id='line_9827'></a>
<a id='line_9828'></a>
<a id='line_9829'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Tristram was sent into France, and had one to</a>
<a id='line_9830'>govern him named Gouvernail, and how he learned to harp, hawk, and</a>
<a id='line_9831'>hunt.</a>
<a id='line_9832'></a>
<a id='line_9833'>And then he let ordain a gentleman that was well learned and taught,</a>
<a id='line_9834'>his name was Gouvernail; and then he sent young Tristram with</a>
<a id='line_9835'>Gouvernail into France to learn the language, and nurture, and deeds of</a>
<a id='line_9836'>arms. And there was Tristram more than seven years. And then when he</a>
<a id='line_9837'>well could speak the language, and had learned all that he might learn</a>
<a id='line_9838'>in that country, then he came home to his father, King Meliodas, again.</a>
<a id='line_9839'>And so Tristram learned to be an harper passing all other, that there</a>
<a id='line_9840'>was none such called in no country, and so on harping and on</a>
<a id='line_9841'>instruments of music he applied him in his youth for to learn.</a>
<a id='line_9842'></a>
<a id='line_9843'>And after, as he grew in might and strength, he laboured ever in</a>
<a id='line_9844'>hunting and in hawking, so that never gentleman more, that ever we</a>
<a id='line_9845'>heard read of. And as the book saith, he began good measures of blowing</a>
<a id='line_9846'>of beasts of venery, and beasts of chase, and all manner of vermin, and</a>
<a id='line_9847'>all these terms we have yet of hawking and hunting. And therefore the</a>
<a id='line_9848'>book of venery, of hawking, and hunting, is called the book of Sir</a>
<a id='line_9849'>Tristram. Wherefore, as meseemeth, all gentlemen that bear old arms</a>
<a id='line_9850'>ought of right to honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that</a>
<a id='line_9851'>gentlemen have and use, and shall to the day of doom, that thereby in a</a>
<a id='line_9852'>manner all men of worship may dissever a gentleman from a yeoman, and</a>
<a id='line_9853'>from a yeoman a villain. For he that gentle is will draw him unto</a>
<a id='line_9854'>gentle tatches, and to follow the customs of noble gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_9855'></a>
<a id='line_9856'>Thus Sir Tristram endured in Cornwall until he was big and strong, of</a>
<a id='line_9857'>the age of eighteen years. And then the King Meliodas had great joy of</a>
<a id='line_9858'>Sir Tristram, and so had the queen, his wife. For ever after in her</a>
<a id='line_9859'>life, because Sir Tristram saved her from the fire, she did never hate</a>
<a id='line_9860'>him more after, but loved him ever after, and gave Tristram many great</a>
<a id='line_9861'>gifts; for every estate loved him, where that he went.</a>

<a id='line_9865'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Marhaus came out of Ireland for to ask truage of</a>
<a id='line_9866'>Cornwall, or else he would fight therefore.</a>
<a id='line_9867'></a>
<a id='line_9868'>Then it befell that King Anguish of Ireland sent unto King Mark of</a>
<a id='line_9869'>Cornwall for his truage, that Cornwall had paid many winters. And all</a>
<a id='line_9870'>that time King Mark was behind of the truage for seven years. And King</a>
<a id='line_9871'>Mark and his barons gave unto the messenger of Ireland these words and</a>
<a id='line_9872'>answer, that they would none pay; and bade the messenger go unto his</a>
<a id='line_9873'>King Anguish, and tell him we will pay him no truage, but tell your</a>
<a id='line_9874'>lord, an he will always have truage of us of Cornwall, bid him send a</a>
<a id='line_9875'>trusty knight of his land, that will fight for his right, and we shall</a>
<a id='line_9876'>find another for to defend our right. With this answer the messengers</a>
<a id='line_9877'>departed into Ireland. And when King Anguish understood the answer of</a>
<a id='line_9878'>the messengers he was wonderly wroth. And then he called unto him Sir</a>
<a id='line_9879'>Marhaus, the good knight, that was nobly proved, and a Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_9880'>Table Round. And this Marhaus was brother unto the queen of Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_9881'>Then the king said thus: Fair brother, Sir Marhaus, I pray you go into</a>
<a id='line_9882'>Cornwall for my sake, and do battle for our truage that of right we</a>
<a id='line_9883'>ought to have; and whatsomever ye spend ye shall have sufficiently,</a>
<a id='line_9884'>more than ye shall need. Sir, said Marhaus, wit ye well that I shall</a>
<a id='line_9885'>not be loath to do battle in the right of you and your land with the</a>
<a id='line_9886'>best knight of the Table Round; for I know them, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_9887'>what be their deeds; and for to advance my deeds and to increase my</a>
<a id='line_9888'>worship I will right gladly go unto this journey for our right.</a>
<a id='line_9889'></a>
<a id='line_9890'>So in all haste there was made purveyance for Sir Marhaus, and he had</a>
<a id='line_9891'>all things that to him needed; and so he departed out of Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_9892'>arrived up in Cornwall even fast by the Castle of Tintagil. And when</a>
<a id='line_9893'>King Mark understood that he was there arrived to fight for Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9894'>then made King Mark great sorrow when he understood that the good and</a>
<a id='line_9895'>noble knight Sir Marhaus was come. For they knew no knight that durst</a>
<a id='line_9896'>have ado with him. For at that time Sir Marhaus was called one of the</a>
<a id='line_9897'>famousest and renowned knights of the world. And thus Sir Marhaus abode</a>
<a id='line_9898'>in the sea, and every day he sent unto King Mark for to pay the truage</a>
<a id='line_9899'>that was behind of seven year, other else to find a knight to fight</a>
<a id='line_9900'>with him for the truage. This manner of message Sir Marhaus sent daily</a>
<a id='line_9901'>unto King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_9902'></a>
<a id='line_9903'>Then they of Cornwall let make cries in every place, that what knight</a>
<a id='line_9904'>would fight for to save the truage of Cornwall, he should be rewarded</a>
<a id='line_9905'>so that he should fare the better, term of his life. Then some of the</a>
<a id='line_9906'>barons said to King Mark, and counselled him to send to the court of</a>
<a id='line_9907'>King Arthur for to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, that was that time named</a>
<a id='line_9908'>for the marvelloust knight of all the world. Then there were some other</a>
<a id='line_9909'>barons that counselled the king not to do so, and said that it was</a>
<a id='line_9910'>labour in vain, because Sir Marhaus was a knight of the Round Table,</a>
<a id='line_9911'>therefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other, but if it</a>
<a id='line_9912'>were any knight at his own request would fight disguised and unknown.</a>
<a id='line_9913'>So the king and all his barons assented that it was no bote to seek any</a>
<a id='line_9914'>knight of the Round Table. This mean while came the language and the</a>
<a id='line_9915'>noise unto King Meliodas, how that Sir Marhaus abode battle fast by</a>
<a id='line_9916'>Tintagil, and how King Mark could find no manner knight to fight for</a>
<a id='line_9917'>him. When young Tristram heard of this he was wroth, and sore ashamed</a>
<a id='line_9918'>that there durst no knight in Cornwall have ado with Sir Marhaus of</a>
<a id='line_9919'>Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_9920'></a>
<a id='line_9921'></a>
<a id='line_9922'></a>
<a id='line_9923'>CHAPTER V. How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage</a>
<a id='line_9924'>of Cornwall, and how he was made knight.</a>
<a id='line_9925'></a>
<a id='line_9926'>Therewithal Tristram went unto his father, King Meliodas, and asked him</a>
<a id='line_9927'>counsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall from truage. For,</a>
<a id='line_9928'>as meseemeth, said Sir Tristram, it were shame that Sir Marhaus, the</a>
<a id='line_9929'>queen’s brother of Ireland, should go away unless that he were foughten</a>
<a id='line_9930'>withal. As for that, said King Meliodas, wit you well, son Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_9931'>that Sir Marhaus is called one of the best knights of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_9932'>Knight of the Table Round; and therefore I know no knight in this</a>
<a id='line_9933'>country that is able to match with him. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that I</a>
<a id='line_9934'>am not made knight; and if Sir Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_9935'>God let me never have worship: an I were made knight I should match</a>
<a id='line_9936'>him. And sir, said Tristram, I pray you give me leave to ride to King</a>
<a id='line_9937'>Mark; and, so ye be not displeased, of King Mark will I be made knight.</a>
<a id='line_9938'>I will well, said King Meliodas, that ye be ruled as your courage will</a>
<a id='line_9939'>rule you. Then Sir Tristram thanked his father much. And then he made</a>
<a id='line_9940'>him ready to ride into Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_9941'></a>
<a id='line_9942'>In the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from King</a>
<a id='line_9943'>Faramon of France’s daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were full piteous</a>
<a id='line_9944'>letters, and in them were written many complaints of love; but Sir</a>
<a id='line_9945'>Tristram had no joy of her letters nor regard unto her. Also she sent</a>
<a id='line_9946'>him a little brachet that was passing fair. But when the king’s</a>
<a id='line_9947'>daughter understood that Sir Tristram would not love her, as the book</a>
<a id='line_9948'>saith, she died for sorrow. And then the same squire that brought the</a>
<a id='line_9949'>letter and the brachet came again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall</a>
<a id='line_9950'>hear in the tale.</a>
<a id='line_9951'></a>
<a id='line_9952'>So this young Sir Tristram rode unto his eme, King Mark of Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_9953'>And when he came there he heard say that there would no knight fight</a>
<a id='line_9954'>with Sir Marhaus. Then yede Sir Tristram unto his eme and said: Sir, if</a>
<a id='line_9955'>ye will give me the order of knighthood, I will do battle with Sir</a>
<a id='line_9956'>Marhaus. What are ye, said the king, and from whence be ye come? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_9957'>said Tristram, I come from King Meliodas that wedded your sister, and a</a>
<a id='line_9958'>gentleman wit ye well I am. King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that</a>
<a id='line_9959'>he was but a young man of age, but he was passingly well made and big.</a>
<a id='line_9960'>Fair sir, said the king, what is your name, and where were ye born?</a>
<a id='line_9961'>Sir, said he again, my name is Tristram, and in the country of Liones</a>
<a id='line_9962'>was I born. Ye say well, said the king; and if ye will do this battle I</a>
<a id='line_9963'>shall make you knight. Therefore I come to you, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_9964'>for none other cause. But then King Mark made him knight. And</a>
<a id='line_9965'>therewithal, anon as he had made him knight, he sent a messenger unto</a>
<a id='line_9966'>Sir Marhaus with letters that said that he had found a young knight</a>
<a id='line_9967'>ready for to take the battle to the uttermost. It may well be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9968'>Marhaus; but tell King Mark I will not fight with no knight but he be</a>
<a id='line_9969'>of blood royal, that is to say, other king’s son, other queen’s son,</a>
<a id='line_9970'>born of a prince or princess.</a>
<a id='line_9971'></a>
<a id='line_9972'>When King Mark understood that, he sent for Sir Tristram de Liones and</a>
<a id='line_9973'>told him what was the answer of Sir Marhaus. Then said Sir Tristram:</a>
<a id='line_9974'>Sithen that he saith so, let him wit that I am come of father side and</a>
<a id='line_9975'>mother side of as noble blood as he is: for, sir, now shall ye know</a>
<a id='line_9976'>that I am King Meliodas’ son, born of your own sister, Dame Elizabeth,</a>
<a id='line_9977'>that died in the forest in the birth of me. O Jesu, said King Mark, ye</a>
<a id='line_9978'>are welcome fair nephew to me. Then in all the haste the king let horse</a>
<a id='line_9979'>Sir Tristram, and armed him in the best manner that might be had or</a>
<a id='line_9980'>gotten for gold or silver. And then King Mark sent unto Sir Marhaus,</a>
<a id='line_9981'>and did him to wit that a better born man than he was himself should</a>
<a id='line_9982'>fight with him, and his name is Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King</a>
<a id='line_9983'>Meliodas, and born of King Mark’s sister. Then was Sir Marhaus glad and</a>
<a id='line_9984'>blithe that he should fight with such a gentleman. And so by the assent</a>
<a id='line_9985'>of King Mark and of Sir Marhaus they let ordain that they should fight</a>
<a id='line_9986'>within an island nigh Sir Marhaus’ ships; and so was Sir Tristram put</a>
<a id='line_9987'>into a vessel both his horse and he, and all that to him longed both</a>
<a id='line_9988'>for his body and for his horse. Sir Tristram lacked nothing. And when</a>
<a id='line_9989'>King Mark and his barons of Cornwall beheld how young Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_9990'>departed with such a carriage to fight for the right of Cornwall, there</a>
<a id='line_9991'>was neither man nor woman of worship but they wept to see and</a>
<a id='line_9992'>understand so young a knight to jeopardy himself for their right.</a>
<a id='line_9993'></a>
<a id='line_9994'></a>
<a id='line_9995'></a>
<a id='line_9996'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Tristram arrived into the Island for to furnish the</a>
<a id='line_9997'>battle with Sir Marhaus.</a>
<a id='line_9998'></a>
<a id='line_9999'>So to shorten this tale, when Sir Tristram was arrived within the</a>
<a id='line_10000'>island he looked to the farther side, and there he saw at an anchor six</a>
<a id='line_10001'>ships nigh to the land; and under the shadow of the ships upon the</a>
<a id='line_10002'>land, there hoved the noble knight, Sir Marhaus of Ireland. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10003'>Tristram commanded his servant Gouvernail to bring his horse to the</a>
<a id='line_10004'>land, and dress his harness at all manner of rights. And then when he</a>
<a id='line_10005'>had so done he mounted upon his horse; and when he was in his saddle</a>
<a id='line_10006'>well apparelled, and his shield dressed upon his shoulder, Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10007'>asked Gouvernail, Where is this knight that I shall have ado withal?</a>
<a id='line_10008'>Sir, said Gouvernail, see ye him not? I weened ye had seen him; yonder</a>
<a id='line_10009'>he hoveth under the umbre of his ships on horseback, with his spear in</a>
<a id='line_10010'>his hand and his shield upon his shoulder. That is truth, said the</a>
<a id='line_10011'>noble knight, Sir Tristram, now I see him well enough.</a>
<a id='line_10012'></a>
<a id='line_10013'>Then he commanded his servant Gouvernail to go to his vessel again: And</a>
<a id='line_10014'>commend me unto mine eme King Mark, and pray him, if that I be slain in</a>
<a id='line_10015'>this battle, for to inter my body as him seemed best; and as for me,</a>
<a id='line_10016'>let him wit that I will never yield me for cowardice; and if I be slain</a>
<a id='line_10017'>and flee not, then they have lost no truage for me; and if so be that I</a>
<a id='line_10018'>flee or yield me as recreant, bid mine eme never bury me in Christian</a>
<a id='line_10019'>burials. And upon thy life, said Sir Tristram to Gouvernail, come thou</a>
<a id='line_10020'>not nigh this island till that thou see me overcome or slain, or else</a>
<a id='line_10021'>that I win yonder knight. So either departed from other sore weeping.</a>
<a id='line_10022'></a>
<a id='line_10023'></a>
<a id='line_10024'></a>
<a id='line_10025'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Tristram fought against Sir Marhaus and achieved</a>
<a id='line_10026'>his battle, and how Sir Marhaus fled to his ship.</a>
<a id='line_10027'></a>
<a id='line_10028'>And then Sir Marhaus avised Sir Tristram, and said thus: Young knight,</a>
<a id='line_10029'>Sir Tristram, what dost thou here? me sore repenteth of thy courage,</a>
<a id='line_10030'>for wit thou well I have been assayed, and the best knights of this</a>
<a id='line_10031'>land have been assayed of my hand; and also I have matched with the</a>
<a id='line_10032'>best knights of the world, and therefore by my counsel return again</a>
<a id='line_10033'>unto thy vessel. And fair knight, and well-proved knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10034'>Tristram, thou shalt well wit I may not forsake thee in this quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_10035'>for I am for thy sake made knight. And thou shalt well wit that I am a</a>
<a id='line_10036'>king’s son born, and gotten upon a queen; and such promise I have made</a>
<a id='line_10037'>at my uncle’s request and mine own seeking, that I shall fight with</a>
<a id='line_10038'>thee unto the uttermost, and deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And</a>
<a id='line_10039'>also wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that this is the greatest cause that</a>
<a id='line_10040'>thou couragest me to have ado with thee, for thou art called one of the</a>
<a id='line_10041'>most renowned knights of the world, and because of that noise and fame</a>
<a id='line_10042'>that thou hast thou givest me courage to have ado with thee, for never</a>
<a id='line_10043'>yet was I proved with good knight; and sithen I took the order of</a>
<a id='line_10044'>knighthood this day, I am well pleased that I may have ado with so good</a>
<a id='line_10045'>a knight as thou art. And now wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that I cast</a>
<a id='line_10046'>me to get worship on thy body; and if that I be not proved, I trust to</a>
<a id='line_10047'>God that I shall be worshipfully proved upon thy body, and to deliver</a>
<a id='line_10048'>the country of Cornwall for ever from all manner of truage from Ireland</a>
<a id='line_10049'>for ever.</a>
<a id='line_10050'></a>
<a id='line_10051'>When Sir Marhaus had heard him say what he would, he said then thus</a>
<a id='line_10052'>again: Fair knight, sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of</a>
<a id='line_10053'>me, I let thee wit worship may thou none lose by me if thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_10054'>stand me three strokes; for I let thee wit for my noble deeds, proved</a>
<a id='line_10055'>and seen, King Arthur made me Knight of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_10056'></a>
<a id='line_10057'>Then they began to feutre their spears, and they met so fiercely</a>
<a id='line_10058'>together that they smote either other down, both horse and all. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_10059'>Marhaus smote Sir Tristram a great wound in the side with his spear,</a>
<a id='line_10060'>and then they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and</a>
<a id='line_10061'>threw their shields afore them. And then they lashed together as men</a>
<a id='line_10062'>that were wild and courageous. And when they had stricken so together</a>
<a id='line_10063'>long, then they left their strokes, and foined at their breaths and</a>
<a id='line_10064'>visors; and when they saw that that might not prevail them, then they</a>
<a id='line_10065'>hurtled together like rams to bear either other down. Thus they fought</a>
<a id='line_10066'>still more than half a day, and either were wounded passing sore, that</a>
<a id='line_10067'>the blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground. By then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10068'>Tristram waxed more fresher than Sir Marhaus, and better winded and</a>
<a id='line_10069'>bigger; and with a mighty stroke he smote Sir Marhaus upon the helm</a>
<a id='line_10070'>such a buffet that it went through his helm, and through the coif of</a>
<a id='line_10071'>steel, and through the brain-pan, and the sword stuck so fast in the</a>
<a id='line_10072'>helm and in his brain-pan that Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his sword</a>
<a id='line_10073'>or ever he might pull it out from his head; and there Marhaus fell down</a>
<a id='line_10074'>on his knees, the edge of Tristram’s sword left in his brain-pan. And</a>
<a id='line_10075'>suddenly Sir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his sword and his</a>
<a id='line_10076'>shield from him, and so ran to his ships and fled his way, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10077'>Tristram had ever his shield and his sword.</a>
<a id='line_10078'></a>
<a id='line_10079'>And when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him, he said: Ah! Sir</a>
<a id='line_10080'>Knight of the Round Table, why withdrawest thou thee? thou dost thyself</a>
<a id='line_10081'>and thy kin great shame, for I am but a young knight, or now I was</a>
<a id='line_10082'>never proved, and rather than I should withdraw me from thee, I had</a>
<a id='line_10083'>rather be hewn in an hundred pieces. Sir Marhaus answered no word but</a>
<a id='line_10084'>yede his way sore groaning. Well, Sir Knight, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_10085'>promise thee thy sword and thy shield shall be mine; and thy shield</a>
<a id='line_10086'>shall I wear in all places where I ride on mine adventures, and in the</a>
<a id='line_10087'>sight of King Arthur and all the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_10088'></a>
<a id='line_10089'></a>
<a id='line_10090'></a>
<a id='line_10091'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Marhaus after that he was arrived in Ireland died</a>
<a id='line_10092'>of the stroke that Sir Tristram had given him, and how Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_10093'>hurt.</a>
<a id='line_10094'></a>
<a id='line_10095'>Anon Sir Marhaus and his fellowship departed into Ireland. And as soon</a>
<a id='line_10096'>as he came to the king, his brother, he let search his wounds. And when</a>
<a id='line_10097'>his head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram’s sword was found</a>
<a id='line_10098'>therein, and might never be had out of his head for no surgeons, and so</a>
<a id='line_10099'>he died of Sir Tristram’s sword; and that piece of the sword the queen,</a>
<a id='line_10100'>his sister, kept it for ever with her, for she thought to be revenged</a>
<a id='line_10101'>an she might.</a>
<a id='line_10102'></a>
<a id='line_10103'>Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and full</a>
<a id='line_10104'>sore bled that he might not within a little while, when he had taken</a>
<a id='line_10105'>cold, unnethe stir him of his limbs. And then he set him down softly</a>
<a id='line_10106'>upon a little hill, and bled fast. Then anon came Gouvernail, his man,</a>
<a id='line_10107'>with his vessel; and the king and his barons came with procession</a>
<a id='line_10108'>against him. And when he was come unto the land, King Mark took him in</a>
<a id='line_10109'>his arms, and the king and Sir Dinas, the seneschal, led Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10110'>into the castle of Tintagil. And then was he searched in the best</a>
<a id='line_10111'>manner, and laid in his bed. And when King Mark saw his wounds he wept</a>
<a id='line_10112'>heartily, and so did all his lords. So God me help, said King Mark, I</a>
<a id='line_10113'>would not for all my lands that my nephew died. So Sir Tristram lay</a>
<a id='line_10114'>there a month and more, and ever he was like to die of that stroke that</a>
<a id='line_10115'>Sir Marhaus smote him first with the spear. For, as the French book</a>
<a id='line_10116'>saith, the spear’s head was envenomed, that Sir Tristram might not be</a>
<a id='line_10117'>whole. Then was King Mark and all his barons passing heavy, for they</a>
<a id='line_10118'>deemed none other but that Sir Tristram should not recover. Then the</a>
<a id='line_10119'>king let send after all manner of leeches and surgeons, both unto men</a>
<a id='line_10120'>and women, and there was none that would behote him the life. Then came</a>
<a id='line_10121'>there a lady that was a right wise lady, and she said plainly unto King</a>
<a id='line_10122'>Mark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his barons, that he should never</a>
<a id='line_10123'>be whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country that the venom</a>
<a id='line_10124'>came from, and in that country should he be holpen or else never. Thus</a>
<a id='line_10125'>said the lady unto the king.</a>
<a id='line_10126'></a>
<a id='line_10127'>When King Mark understood that, he let purvey for Sir Tristram a fair</a>
<a id='line_10128'>vessel, well victualled, and therein was put Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_10129'>Gouvernail with him, and Sir Tristram took his harp with him, and so he</a>
<a id='line_10130'>was put into the sea to sail into Ireland; and so by good fortune he</a>
<a id='line_10131'>arrived up in Ireland, even fast by a castle where the king and the</a>
<a id='line_10132'>queen was; and at his arrival he sat and harped in his bed a merry lay,</a>
<a id='line_10133'>such one heard they never none in Ireland before that time.</a>
<a id='line_10134'></a>
<a id='line_10135'>And when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that was</a>
<a id='line_10136'>such an harper, anon the king sent for him, and let search his wounds,</a>
<a id='line_10137'>and then asked him his name. Then he answered, I am of the country of</a>
<a id='line_10138'>Liones, and my name is Tramtrist, that thus was wounded in a battle as</a>
<a id='line_10139'>I fought for a lady’s right. So God me help, said King Anguish, ye</a>
<a id='line_10140'>shall have all the help in this land that ye may have here; but I let</a>
<a id='line_10141'>you wit, in Cornwall I had a great loss as ever had king, for there I</a>
<a id='line_10142'>lost the best knight of the world; his name was Marhaus, a full noble</a>
<a id='line_10143'>knight, and Knight of the Table Round; and there he told Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10144'>wherefore Sir Marhaus was slain. Sir Tristram made semblant as he had</a>
<a id='line_10145'>been sorry, and better knew he how it was than the king.</a>
<a id='line_10146'></a>
<a id='line_10147'></a>
<a id='line_10148'></a>
<a id='line_10149'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_10150'>first for to be healed of his wound.</a>
<a id='line_10151'></a>
<a id='line_10152'>Then the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his</a>
<a id='line_10153'>daughter’s ward and keeping, because she was a noble surgeon. And when</a>
<a id='line_10154'>she had searched him she found in the bottom of his wound that therein</a>
<a id='line_10155'>was poison, and so she healed him within a while; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_10156'>Tramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud, for she was at that time</a>
<a id='line_10157'>the fairest maid and lady of the world. And there Tramtrist learned her</a>
<a id='line_10158'>to harp, and she began to have a great fantasy unto him. And at that</a>
<a id='line_10159'>time Sir Palamides, the Saracen, was in that country, and well</a>
<a id='line_10160'>cherished with the king and the queen. And every day Sir Palamides drew</a>
<a id='line_10161'>unto La Beale Isoud and proffered her many gifts, for he loved her</a>
<a id='line_10162'>passingly well. All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he Sir</a>
<a id='line_10163'>Palamides for a noble knight and a mighty man. And wit you well Sir</a>
<a id='line_10164'>Tramtrist had great despite at Sir Palamides, for La Beale Isoud told</a>
<a id='line_10165'>Tramtrist that Palamides was in will to be christened for her sake.</a>
<a id='line_10166'>Thus was there great envy betwixt Tramtrist and Sir Palamides.</a>
<a id='line_10167'></a>
<a id='line_10168'>Then it befell that King Anguish let cry a great jousts and a great</a>
<a id='line_10169'>tournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the Launds, and she</a>
<a id='line_10170'>was nigh cousin unto the king. And what man won her, three days after</a>
<a id='line_10171'>he should wed her and have all her lands. This cry was made in England,</a>
<a id='line_10172'>Wales, Scotland, and also in France and in Brittany. It befell upon a</a>
<a id='line_10173'>day La Beale Isoud came unto Sir Tramtrist, and told him of this</a>
<a id='line_10174'>tournament. He answered and said: Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight,</a>
<a id='line_10175'>and but late I had been dead had not your good ladyship been. Now, fair</a>
<a id='line_10176'>lady, what would ye I should do in this matter? well ye wot, my lady,</a>
<a id='line_10177'>that I may not joust. Ah, Tramtrist, said La Beale Isoud, why will ye</a>
<a id='line_10178'>not have ado at that tournament? well I wot Sir Palamides shall be</a>
<a id='line_10179'>there, and to do what he may; and therefore Tramtrist, I pray you for</a>
<a id='line_10180'>to be there, for else Sir Palamides is like to win the degree. Madam,</a>
<a id='line_10181'>said Tramtrist, as for that, it may be so, for he is a proved knight,</a>
<a id='line_10182'>and I am but a young knight and late made; and the first battle that I</a>
<a id='line_10183'>did it mishapped me to be sore wounded as ye see. But an I wist ye</a>
<a id='line_10184'>would be my better lady, at that tournament I will be, so that ye will</a>
<a id='line_10185'>keep my counsel and let no creature have knowledge that I shall joust</a>
<a id='line_10186'>but yourself, and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor person</a>
<a id='line_10187'>shall I jeopard there for your sake, that, peradventure, Sir Palamides</a>
<a id='line_10188'>shall know when that I come. Thereto, said La Beale Isoud, do your</a>
<a id='line_10189'>best, and as I can, said La Beale Isoud, I shall purvey horse and</a>
<a id='line_10190'>armour for you at my device. As ye will so be it, said Sir Tramtrist, I</a>
<a id='line_10191'>will be at your commandment.</a>
<a id='line_10192'></a>
<a id='line_10193'>So at the day of jousts there came Sir Palamides with a black shield,</a>
<a id='line_10194'>and he overthrew many knights, that all the people had marvel of him.</a>
<a id='line_10195'>For he put to the worse Sir Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravaine, Bagdemagus,</a>
<a id='line_10196'>Kay, Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and</a>
<a id='line_10197'>Griflet le Fise de Dieu. All these the first day Sir Palamides struck</a>
<a id='line_10198'>down to the earth. And then all manner of knights were adread of Sir</a>
<a id='line_10199'>Palamides, and many called him the Knight with the Black Shield. So</a>
<a id='line_10200'>that day Sir Palamides had great worship.</a>
<a id='line_10201'></a>
<a id='line_10202'>Then came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would not</a>
<a id='line_10203'>joust. Sir, he said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not</a>
<a id='line_10204'>adventure me. Then came there the same squire that was sent from the</a>
<a id='line_10205'>king’s daughter of France unto Sir Tristram. And when he had espied Sir</a>
<a id='line_10206'>Tristram he fell flat to his feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what</a>
<a id='line_10207'>courtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram. And therewithal suddenly</a>
<a id='line_10208'>Sir Tristram ran unto his squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and</a>
<a id='line_10209'>prayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name. Sir, said Hebes, I</a>
<a id='line_10210'>will not discover your name but if ye command me.</a>
<a id='line_10211'></a>
<a id='line_10212'></a>
<a id='line_10213'></a>
<a id='line_10214'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Tristram won the degree at a tournament in Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_10215'>and there made Palamides to bear no more harness in a year.</a>
<a id='line_10216'></a>
<a id='line_10217'>Then Sir Tristram asked him what he did in those countries. Sir, he</a>
<a id='line_10218'>said, I came hither with Sir Gawaine for to be made knight, and if it</a>
<a id='line_10219'>please you, of your hands that I may be made knight. Await upon me as</a>
<a id='line_10220'>to-morn secretly, and in the field I shall make you a knight.</a>
<a id='line_10221'></a>
<a id='line_10222'>Then had La Beale Isoud great suspicion unto Tramtrist, that he was</a>
<a id='line_10223'>some man of worship proved, and therewith she comforted herself, and</a>
<a id='line_10224'>cast more love unto him than she had done to-fore. And so on the morn</a>
<a id='line_10225'>Sir Palamides made him ready to come into the field as he did the first</a>
<a id='line_10226'>day. And there he smote down the King with the Hundred Knights, and the</a>
<a id='line_10227'>King of Scots. Then had La Beale Isoud ordained and well arrayed Sir</a>
<a id='line_10228'>Tristram in white horse and harness. And right so she let put him out</a>
<a id='line_10229'>at a privy postern, and so he came into the field as it had been a</a>
<a id='line_10230'>bright angel. And anon Sir Palamides espied him, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_10231'>feutred a spear unto Sir Tramtrist, and he again unto him. And there</a>
<a id='line_10232'>Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palamides unto the earth. And then there</a>
<a id='line_10233'>was a great noise of people: some said Sir Palamides had a fall, some</a>
<a id='line_10234'>said the Knight with the Black Shield had a fall. And wit you well La</a>
<a id='line_10235'>Beale Isoud was passing glad. And then Sir Gawaine and his fellows nine</a>
<a id='line_10236'>had marvel what knight it might be that had smitten down Sir Palamides.</a>
<a id='line_10237'>Then would there none joust with Tramtrist, but all that there were</a>
<a id='line_10238'>forsook him, most and least. Then Sir Tristram made Hebes a knight, and</a>
<a id='line_10239'>caused him to put himself forth, and did right well that day. So after</a>
<a id='line_10240'>Sir Hebes held him with Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10241'></a>
<a id='line_10242'>And when Sir Palamides had received this fall, wit ye well that he was</a>
<a id='line_10243'>sore ashamed, and as privily as he might he withdrew him out of the</a>
<a id='line_10244'>field. All that espied Sir Tristram, and lightly he rode after Sir</a>
<a id='line_10245'>Palamides and overtook him, and bade him turn, for better he would</a>
<a id='line_10246'>assay him or ever he departed. Then Sir Palamides turned him, and</a>
<a id='line_10247'>either lashed at other with their swords. But at the first stroke Sir</a>
<a id='line_10248'>Tristram smote down Palamides, and gave him such a stroke upon the head</a>
<a id='line_10249'>that he fell to the earth. So then Tristram bade yield him, and do his</a>
<a id='line_10250'>commandment, or else he would slay him. When Sir Palamides beheld his</a>
<a id='line_10251'>countenance, he dread his buffets so, that he granted all his askings.</a>
<a id='line_10252'>Well said, said Sir Tristram, this shall be your charge. First, upon</a>
<a id='line_10253'>pain of your life that ye forsake my lady La Beale Isoud, and in no</a>
<a id='line_10254'>manner wise that ye draw not to her. Also this twelvemonth and a day</a>
<a id='line_10255'>that ye bear none armour nor none harness of war. Now promise me this,</a>
<a id='line_10256'>or here shalt thou die. Alas, said Palamides, for ever am I ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_10257'>Then he sware as Sir Tristram had commanded him. Then for despite and</a>
<a id='line_10258'>anger Sir Palamides cut off his harness, and threw them away.</a>
<a id='line_10259'></a>
<a id='line_10260'>And so Sir Tristram turned again to the castle where was La Beale</a>
<a id='line_10261'>Isoud; and by the way he met with a damosel that asked after Sir</a>
<a id='line_10262'>Launcelot, that won the Dolorous Guard worshipfully; and this damosel</a>
<a id='line_10263'>asked Sir Tristram what he was. For it was told her that it was he that</a>
<a id='line_10264'>smote down Sir Palamides, by whom the ten knights of King Arthur’s were</a>
<a id='line_10265'>smitten down. Then the damosel prayed Sir Tristram to tell her what he</a>
<a id='line_10266'>was, and whether that he were Sir Launcelot du Lake, for she deemed</a>
<a id='line_10267'>that there was no knight in the world might do such deeds of arms but</a>
<a id='line_10268'>if it were Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that</a>
<a id='line_10269'>I am not Sir Launcelot, for I was never of such prowess, but in God is</a>
<a id='line_10270'>all that he may make me as good a knight as the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_10271'>Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said she, put up thy visor; and when she</a>
<a id='line_10272'>beheld his visage she thought she saw never a better man’s visage, nor</a>
<a id='line_10273'>a better faring knight. And then when the damosel knew certainly that</a>
<a id='line_10274'>he was not Sir Launcelot, then she took her leave, and departed from</a>
<a id='line_10275'>him. And then Sir Tristram rode privily unto the postern, where kept</a>
<a id='line_10276'>him La Beale Isoud, and there she made him good cheer, and thanked God</a>
<a id='line_10277'>of his good speed. So anon, within a while the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_10278'>understood that it was Tramtrist that smote down Sir Palamides; then</a>
<a id='line_10279'>was he much made of, more than he was before.</a>
<a id='line_10280'></a>
<a id='line_10281'></a>
<a id='line_10282'></a>
<a id='line_10283'>CHAPTER XI. How the queen espied that Sir Tristram had slain her</a>
<a id='line_10284'>brother Sir Marhaus by his sword, and in what jeopardy he was.</a>
<a id='line_10285'></a>
<a id='line_10286'>Thus was Sir Tramtrist long there well cherished with the king and the</a>
<a id='line_10287'>queen, and namely with La Beale Isoud. So upon a day the queen and La</a>
<a id='line_10288'>Beale Isoud made a bain for Sir Tramtrist. And when he was in his bain</a>
<a id='line_10289'>the queen and Isoud, her daughter, roamed up and down in the chamber;</a>
<a id='line_10290'>and therewhiles Gouvernail and Hebes attended upon Tramtrist, and the</a>
<a id='line_10291'>queen beheld his sword thereas it lay upon his bed. And then by unhap</a>
<a id='line_10292'>the queen drew out his sword and beheld it a long while, and both they</a>
<a id='line_10293'>thought it a passing fair sword; but within a foot and an half of the</a>
<a id='line_10294'>point there was a great piece thereof out-broken of the edge. And when</a>
<a id='line_10295'>the queen espied that gap in the sword, she remembered her of a piece</a>
<a id='line_10296'>of a sword that was found in the brain-pan of Sir Marhaus, the good</a>
<a id='line_10297'>knight that was her brother. Alas then, said she unto her daughter, La</a>
<a id='line_10298'>Beale Isoud, this is the same traitor knight that slew my brother,</a>
<a id='line_10299'>thine eme. When Isoud heard her say so she was passing sore abashed,</a>
<a id='line_10300'>for passing well she loved Tramtrist, and full well she knew the</a>
<a id='line_10301'>cruelness of her mother the queen.</a>
<a id='line_10302'></a>
<a id='line_10303'>Anon therewithal the queen went unto her own chamber, and sought her</a>
<a id='line_10304'>coffer, and there she took out the piece or the sword that was pulled</a>
<a id='line_10305'>out of Sir Marhaus’ head after that he was dead. And then she ran with</a>
<a id='line_10306'>that piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the bed. And when she put</a>
<a id='line_10307'>that piece of steel and iron unto the sword, it was as meet as it might</a>
<a id='line_10308'>be when it was new broken. And then the queen gripped that sword in her</a>
<a id='line_10309'>hand fiercely, and with all her might she ran straight upon Tramtrist</a>
<a id='line_10310'>where he sat in his bain, and there she had rived him through had not</a>
<a id='line_10311'>Sir Hebes gotten her in his arms, and pulled the sword from her, and</a>
<a id='line_10312'>else she had thrust him through.</a>
<a id='line_10313'></a>
<a id='line_10314'>Then when she was let of her evil will she ran to the King Anguish, her</a>
<a id='line_10315'>husband, and said on her knees: O my lord, here have ye in your house</a>
<a id='line_10316'>that traitor knight that slew my brother and your servant, that noble</a>
<a id='line_10317'>knight, Sir Marhaus. Who is that, said King Anguish, and where is he?</a>
<a id='line_10318'>Sir, she said, it is Sir Tramtrist, the same knight that my daughter</a>
<a id='line_10319'>healed. Alas, said the king, therefore am I right heavy, for he is a</a>
<a id='line_10320'>full noble knight as ever I saw in field. But I charge you, said the</a>
<a id='line_10321'>king to the queen, that ye have not ado with that knight, but let me</a>
<a id='line_10322'>deal with him.</a>
<a id='line_10323'></a>
<a id='line_10324'>Then the king went into the chamber unto Sir Tramtrist, and then was he</a>
<a id='line_10325'>gone unto his chamber, and the king found him all ready armed to mount</a>
<a id='line_10326'>upon his horse. When the king saw him all ready armed to go unto</a>
<a id='line_10327'>horseback, the king said: Nay, Tramtrist, it will not avail to compare</a>
<a id='line_10328'>thee against me; but thus much I shall do for my worship and for thy</a>
<a id='line_10329'>love; in so much as thou art within my court it were no worship for me</a>
<a id='line_10330'>to slay thee: therefore upon this condition I will give thee leave for</a>
<a id='line_10331'>to depart from this court in safety, so thou wilt tell me who was thy</a>
<a id='line_10332'>father, and what is thy name, and if thou slew Sir Marhaus, my brother.</a>

<a id='line_10337'>out of Ireland for to come into Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_10338'></a>
<a id='line_10339'>Sir, said Tristram, now I shall tell you all the truth: my father’s</a>
<a id='line_10340'>name is Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my mother hight Elizabeth,</a>
<a id='line_10341'>that was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and my mother died of me in</a>
<a id='line_10342'>the forest, and because thereof she commanded, or she died, that when I</a>
<a id='line_10343'>were christened they should christen me Tristram; and because I would</a>
<a id='line_10344'>not be known in this country I turned my name and let me call</a>
<a id='line_10345'>Tramtrist; and for the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme’s sake,</a>
<a id='line_10346'>and for the right of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years. And wit</a>
<a id='line_10347'>ye well, said Tristram unto the king, I did the battle for the love of</a>
<a id='line_10348'>mine uncle, King Mark, and for the love of the country of Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_10349'>for to increase mine honour; for that same day that I fought with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10350'>Marhaus I was made knight, and never or then did I battle with no</a>
<a id='line_10351'>knight, and from me he went alive, and left his shield and his sword</a>
<a id='line_10352'>behind.</a>
<a id='line_10353'></a>
<a id='line_10354'>So God me help, said the king, I may not say but ye did as a knight</a>
<a id='line_10355'>should, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and to increase</a>
<a id='line_10356'>your worship as a knight should; howbeit I may not maintain you in this</a>
<a id='line_10357'>country with my worship, unless that I should displease my barons, and</a>
<a id='line_10358'>my wife and her kin. Sir, said Tristram, I thank you of your good</a>
<a id='line_10359'>lordship that I have had with you here, and the great goodness my lady,</a>
<a id='line_10360'>your daughter, hath shewed me, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, it may</a>
<a id='line_10361'>so happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death, for in</a>
<a id='line_10362'>the parts of England it may happen I may do you service at some season,</a>
<a id='line_10363'>that ye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good lordship. With</a>
<a id='line_10364'>more I promise you as I am true knight, that in all places I shall be</a>
<a id='line_10365'>my lady your daughter’s servant and knight in right and in wrong, and I</a>
<a id='line_10366'>shall never fail her, to do as much as a knight may do. Also I beseech</a>
<a id='line_10367'>your good grace that I may take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and</a>
<a id='line_10368'>at all the barons and knights. I will well, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_10369'></a>
<a id='line_10370'>Then Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of her.</a>
<a id='line_10371'>And then he told her all, what he was, and how he had changed his name</a>
<a id='line_10372'>because he would not be known, and how a lady told him that he should</a>
<a id='line_10373'>never be whole till he came into this country where the poison was</a>
<a id='line_10374'>made, wherethrough I was near my death had not your ladyship been. O</a>
<a id='line_10375'>gentle knight, said La Beale Isoud, full woe am I of thy departing, for</a>
<a id='line_10376'>I saw never man that I owed so good will to. And therewithal she wept</a>
<a id='line_10377'>heartily. Madam, said Sir Tristram, ye shall understand that my name is</a>
<a id='line_10378'>Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his queen.</a>
<a id='line_10379'>And I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days of my life</a>
<a id='line_10380'>your knight. Gramercy, said La Beale Isoud, and I promise you</a>
<a id='line_10381'>there-against that I shall not be married this seven years but by your</a>
<a id='line_10382'>assent; and to whom that ye will I shall be married to him will I have,</a>
<a id='line_10383'>and he will have me if ye will consent.</a>
<a id='line_10384'></a>
<a id='line_10385'>And then Sir Tristram gave her a ring, and she gave him another; and</a>
<a id='line_10386'>therewith he departed from her, leaving her making great dole and</a>
<a id='line_10387'>lamentation; and he straight went unto the court among all the barons,</a>
<a id='line_10388'>and there he took his leave at most and least, and openly he said among</a>
<a id='line_10389'>them all: Fair lords, now it is so that I must depart: if there be any</a>
<a id='line_10390'>man here that I have offended unto, or that any man be with me grieved,</a>
<a id='line_10391'>let complain him here afore me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend</a>
<a id='line_10392'>it unto my power. And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or</a>
<a id='line_10393'>say of me wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here</a>
<a id='line_10394'>is my body to make it good, body against body. And all they stood</a>
<a id='line_10395'>still, there was not one that would say one word; yet were there some</a>
<a id='line_10396'>knights that were of the queen’s blood, and of Sir Marhaus’ blood, but</a>

<a id='line_10404'>So Sir Tristram departed, and took the sea, and with good wind he</a>
<a id='line_10405'>arrived up at Tintagil in Cornwall; and when King Mark was whole in his</a>
<a id='line_10406'>prosperity there came tidings that Sir Tristram was arrived, and whole</a>
<a id='line_10407'>of his wounds: thereof was King Mark passing glad, and so were all the</a>
<a id='line_10408'>barons; and when he saw his time he rode unto his father, King</a>
<a id='line_10409'>Meliodas, and there he had all the cheer that the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_10410'>could make him. And then largely King Meliodas and his queen departed</a>
<a id='line_10411'>of their lands and goods to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10412'></a>
<a id='line_10413'>Then by the license of King Meliodas, his father, he returned again</a>
<a id='line_10414'>unto the court of King Mark, and there he lived in great joy long time,</a>
<a id='line_10415'>until at the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt</a>
<a id='line_10416'>King Mark and Sir Tristram, for they loved both one lady. And she was</a>
<a id='line_10417'>an earl’s wife that hight Sir Segwarides. And this lady loved Sir</a>
<a id='line_10418'>Tristram passingly well. And he loved her again, for she was a passing</a>
<a id='line_10419'>fair lady, and that espied Sir Tristram well. Then King Mark understood</a>
<a id='line_10420'>that and was jealous, for King Mark loved her passingly well.</a>
<a id='line_10421'></a>
<a id='line_10422'>So it fell upon a day this lady sent a dwarf unto Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_10423'>bade him, as he loved her, that he would be with her the night next</a>
<a id='line_10424'>following. Also she charged you that ye come not to her but if ye be</a>
<a id='line_10425'>well armed, for her lover was called a good knight. Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10426'>answered to the dwarf: Recommend me unto my lady, and tell her I will</a>
<a id='line_10427'>not fail but I will be with her the term that she hath set me. And with</a>
<a id='line_10428'>this answer the dwarf departed. And King Mark espied that the dwarf was</a>
<a id='line_10429'>with Sir Tristram upon message from Segwarides’ wife; then King Mark</a>
<a id='line_10430'>sent for the dwarf, and when he was come he made the dwarf by force to</a>
<a id='line_10431'>tell him all, why and wherefore that he came on message from Sir</a>
<a id='line_10432'>Tristram. Now, said King Mark, go where thou wilt, and upon pain of</a>
<a id='line_10433'>death that thou say no word that thou spakest with me; so the dwarf</a>
<a id='line_10434'>departed from the king.</a>
<a id='line_10435'></a>
<a id='line_10436'>And that same night that the steven was set betwixt Segwarides’ wife</a>
<a id='line_10437'>and Sir Tristram, King Mark armed him, and made him ready, and took two</a>
<a id='line_10438'>knights of his counsel with him; and so he rode afore for to abide by</a>
<a id='line_10439'>the way for to wait upon Sir Tristram. And as Sir Tristram came riding</a>
<a id='line_10440'>upon his way with his spear in his hand, King Mark came hurtling upon</a>
<a id='line_10441'>him with his two knights suddenly. And all three smote him with their</a>
<a id='line_10442'>spears, and King Mark hurt Sir Tristram on the breast right sore. And</a>
<a id='line_10443'>then Sir Tristram feutred his spear, and smote his uncle, King Mark, so</a>
<a id='line_10444'>sore, that he rashed him to the earth, and bruised him that he lay</a>
<a id='line_10445'>still in a swoon, and long it was or ever he might wield himself. And</a>
<a id='line_10446'>then he ran to the one knight, and eft to the other, and smote them to</a>
<a id='line_10447'>the cold earth, that they lay still. And therewithal Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_10448'>forth sore wounded to the lady, and found her abiding him at a postern.</a>

<a id='line_10451'></a>
<a id='line_10452'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram lay with the lady, and how her husband</a>
<a id='line_10453'>fought with Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10454'></a>
<a id='line_10455'>And there she welcomed him fair, and either halsed other in arms, and</a>
<a id='line_10456'>so she let put up his horse in the best wise, and then she unarmed him.</a>
<a id='line_10457'>And so they supped lightly, and went to bed with great joy and</a>
<a id='line_10458'>pleasaunce; and so in his raging he took no keep of his green wound</a>
<a id='line_10459'>that King Mark had given him. And so Sir Tristram be-bled both the over</a>
<a id='line_10460'>sheet and the nether, and pillows, and head sheet. And within a while</a>
<a id='line_10461'>there came one afore, that warned her that her lord was near-hand</a>
<a id='line_10462'>within a bow-draught. So she made Sir Tristram to arise, and so he</a>
<a id='line_10463'>armed him, and took his horse, and so departed. By then was come</a>
<a id='line_10464'>Segwarides, her lord, and when he found her bed troubled and broken,</a>
<a id='line_10465'>and went near and beheld it by candle light, then he saw that there had</a>
<a id='line_10466'>lain a wounded knight. Ah, false traitress, then he said, why hast thou</a>
<a id='line_10467'>betrayed me? And therewithal he swang out a sword, and said: But if</a>
<a id='line_10468'>thou tell me who hath been here, here thou shalt die. Ah, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_10469'>mercy, said the lady, and held up her hands, saying: Slay me not, and I</a>
<a id='line_10470'>shall tell you all who hath been here. Tell anon, said Segwarides, to</a>
<a id='line_10471'>me all the truth. Anon for dread she said: Here was Sir Tristram with</a>
<a id='line_10472'>me, and by the way as he came to me ward, he was sore wounded. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_10473'>false traitress, said Segwarides, where is he become? Sir, she said, he</a>
<a id='line_10474'>is armed, and departed on horseback, not yet hence half a mile. Ye say</a>
<a id='line_10475'>well, said Segwarides.</a>
<a id='line_10476'></a>
<a id='line_10477'>Then he armed him lightly, and gat his horse, and rode after Sir</a>
<a id='line_10478'>Tristram that rode straightway unto Tintagil. And within a while he</a>
<a id='line_10479'>overtook Sir Tristram, and then he bade him, Turn, false traitor</a>
<a id='line_10480'>knight. And Sir Tristram anon turned him against him. And therewithal</a>
<a id='line_10481'>Segwarides smote Sir Tristram with a spear that it all to-brast; and</a>
<a id='line_10482'>then he swang out his sword and smote fast at Sir Tristram. Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_10483'>said Sir Tristram, I counsel you that ye smite no more, howbeit for the</a>
<a id='line_10484'>wrongs that I have done you I will forbear you as long as I may. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_10485'>said Segwarides, that shall not be, for either thou shalt die or I.</a>
<a id='line_10486'></a>
<a id='line_10487'>Then Sir Tristram drew out his sword, and hurtled his horse unto him</a>
<a id='line_10488'>fiercely, and through the waist of the body he smote Sir Segwarides</a>
<a id='line_10489'>that he fell to the earth in a swoon. And so Sir Tristram departed and</a>
<a id='line_10490'>left him there. And so he rode unto Tintagil and took his lodging</a>
<a id='line_10491'>secretly, for he would not be known that he was hurt. Also Sir</a>
<a id='line_10492'>Segwarides’ men rode after their master, whom they found lying in the</a>
<a id='line_10493'>field sore wounded, and brought him home on his shield, and there he</a>
<a id='line_10494'>lay long or that he were whole, but at the last he recovered. Also King</a>
<a id='line_10495'>Mark would not be aknown of that Sir Tristram and he had met that</a>
<a id='line_10496'>night. And as for Sir Tristram, he knew not that King Mark had met with</a>
<a id='line_10497'>him. And so the king askance came to Sir Tristram, to comfort him as he</a>
<a id='line_10498'>lay sick in his bed. But as long as King Mark lived he loved never Sir</a>
<a id='line_10499'>Tristram after that; though there was fair speech, love was there none.</a>
<a id='line_10500'>And thus it passed many weeks and days, and all was forgiven and</a>
<a id='line_10501'>forgotten; for Sir Segwarides durst not have ado with Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_10502'>because of his noble prowess, and also because he was nephew unto King</a>
<a id='line_10503'>Mark; therefore he let it overslip: for he that hath a privy hurt is</a>
<a id='line_10504'>loath to have a shame outward.</a>

<a id='line_10508'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Bleoberis demanded the fairest lady in King Mark’s</a>
<a id='line_10509'>court, whom he took away, and how he was fought with.</a>
<a id='line_10510'></a>
<a id='line_10511'>Then it befell upon a day that the good knight Bleoberis de Ganis,</a>
<a id='line_10512'>brother to Blamore de Ganis, and nigh cousin unto the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_10513'>Launcelot du Lake, this Bleoberis came unto the court of King Mark, and</a>
<a id='line_10514'>there he asked of King Mark a boon, to give him what gift that he would</a>
<a id='line_10515'>ask in his court. When the king heard him ask so, he marvelled of his</a>
<a id='line_10516'>asking, but because he was a knight of the Round Table, and of a great</a>
<a id='line_10517'>renown, King Mark granted him his whole asking. Then, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10518'>Bleoberis, I will have the fairest lady in your court that me list to</a>
<a id='line_10519'>choose. I may not say nay, said King Mark; now choose at your</a>
<a id='line_10520'>adventure. And so Sir Bleoberis did choose Sir Segwarides’ wife, and</a>
<a id='line_10521'>took her by the hand, and so went his way with her; and so he took his</a>
<a id='line_10522'>horse and gart set her behind his squire, and rode upon his way.</a>
<a id='line_10523'></a>
<a id='line_10524'>When Sir Segwarides heard tell that his lady was gone with a knight of</a>
<a id='line_10525'>King Arthur’s court, then he armed him and rode after that knight for</a>
<a id='line_10526'>to rescue his lady. So when Bleoberis was gone with this lady, King</a>
<a id='line_10527'>Mark and all the court was wroth that she was away. Then were there</a>
<a id='line_10528'>certain ladies that knew that there were great love between Sir</a>
<a id='line_10529'>Tristram and her, and also that lady loved Sir Tristram above all other</a>
<a id='line_10530'>knights. Then there was one lady that rebuked Sir Tristram in the</a>
<a id='line_10531'>horriblest wise, and called him coward knight, that he would for shame</a>
<a id='line_10532'>of his knighthood see a lady so shamefully be taken away from his</a>
<a id='line_10533'>uncle’s court. But she meant that either of them had loved other with</a>
<a id='line_10534'>entire heart. But Sir Tristram answered her thus: Fair lady, it is not</a>
<a id='line_10535'>my part to have ado in such matters while her lord and husband is</a>
<a id='line_10536'>present here; and if it had been that her lord had not been here in</a>
<a id='line_10537'>this court, then for the worship of this court peradventure I would</a>
<a id='line_10538'>have been her champion, and if so be Sir Segwarides speed not well, it</a>
<a id='line_10539'>may happen that I will speak with that good knight or ever he pass from</a>
<a id='line_10540'>this country.</a>
<a id='line_10541'></a>
<a id='line_10542'>Then within a while came one of Sir Segwarides’ squires, and told in</a>
<a id='line_10543'>the court that Sir Segwarides was beaten sore and wounded to the point</a>
<a id='line_10544'>of death; as he would have rescued his lady Sir Bleoberis overthrew him</a>
<a id='line_10545'>and sore hath wounded him. Then was King Mark heavy thereof, and all</a>
<a id='line_10546'>the court. When Sir Tristram heard of this he was ashamed and sore</a>
<a id='line_10547'>grieved; and then was he soon armed and on horseback, and Gouvernail,</a>
<a id='line_10548'>his servant, bare his shield and spear. And so as Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_10549'>fast he met with Sir Andred his cousin, that by the commandment of King</a>
<a id='line_10550'>Mark was sent to bring forth, an ever it lay in his power, two knights</a>
<a id='line_10551'>of Arthur’s court, that rode by the country to seek their adventures.</a>
<a id='line_10552'>When Sir Tristram saw Sir Andred he asked him what tidings. So God me</a>
<a id='line_10553'>help, said Sir Andred, there was never worse with me, for here by the</a>
<a id='line_10554'>commandment of King Mark I was sent to fetch two knights of King</a>
<a id='line_10555'>Arthur’s court, and that one beat me and wounded me, and set nought by</a>
<a id='line_10556'>my message. Fair cousin, said Sir Tristram, ride on your way, and if I</a>
<a id='line_10557'>may meet them it may happen I shall revenge you. So Sir Andred rode</a>
<a id='line_10558'>into Cornwall, and Sir Tristram rode after the two knights, the which</a>
<a id='line_10559'>one hight Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.</a>

<a id='line_10562'></a>
<a id='line_10563'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Tristram fought with two knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_10564'>Table.</a>
<a id='line_10565'></a>
<a id='line_10566'>Then within a while Sir Tristram saw them afore him, two likely</a>
<a id='line_10567'>knights. Sir, said Gouvernail unto his master, Sir, I would counsel you</a>
<a id='line_10568'>not to have ado with them, for they be two proved knights of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_10569'>court. As for that, said Sir Tristram, have ye no doubt but I will have</a>
<a id='line_10570'>ado with them to increase my worship, for it is many day sithen I did</a>
<a id='line_10571'>any deeds of arms. Do as ye list, said Gouvernail. And therewithal anon</a>
<a id='line_10572'>Sir Tristram asked them from whence they came, and whither they would,</a>
<a id='line_10573'>and what they did in those marches. Sir Sagramore looked upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_10574'>Tristram, and had scorn of his words, and asked him again, Fair knight,</a>
<a id='line_10575'>be ye a knight of Cornwall? Whereby ask ye it? said Sir Tristram. For</a>
<a id='line_10576'>it is seldom seen, said Sir Sagramore, that ye Cornish knights be</a>
<a id='line_10577'>valiant men of arms; for within these two hours there met us one of</a>
<a id='line_10578'>your Cornish knights, and great words he spake, and anon with little</a>
<a id='line_10579'>might he was laid to the earth. And, as I trow, said Sir Sagramore, ye</a>
<a id='line_10580'>shall have the same handsel that he had. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_10581'>it may so happen that I may better withstand than he did, and whether</a>
<a id='line_10582'>ye will or nill I will have ado with you, because he was my cousin that</a>
<a id='line_10583'>ye beat. And therefore here do your best, and wit ye well but if ye</a>
<a id='line_10584'>quit you the better here upon this ground, one knight of Cornwall shall</a>
<a id='line_10585'>beat you both.</a>
<a id='line_10586'></a>
<a id='line_10587'>When Sir Dodinas le Savage heard him say so he gat a spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_10588'>and said, Sir knight, keep well thyself: And then they departed and</a>
<a id='line_10589'>came together as it had been thunder. And Sir Dodinas’ spear brast</a>
<a id='line_10590'>in-sunder, but Sir Tristram smote him with a more might, that he smote</a>
<a id='line_10591'>him clean over the horse-croup, that nigh he had broken his neck. When</a>
<a id='line_10592'>Sir Sagramore saw his fellow have such a fall he marvelled what knight</a>
<a id='line_10593'>he might be. And he dressed his spear with all his might, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10594'>Tristram against him, and they came together as the thunder, and there</a>
<a id='line_10595'>Sir Tristram smote Sir Sagramore a strong buffet, that he bare his</a>
<a id='line_10596'>horse and him to the earth, and in the falling he brake his thigh.</a>
<a id='line_10597'></a>
<a id='line_10598'>When this was done Sir Tristram asked them: Fair knights, will ye any</a>
<a id='line_10599'>more? Be there no bigger knights in the court of King Arthur? it is to</a>
<a id='line_10600'>you shame to say of us knights of Cornwall dishonour, for it may happen</a>
<a id='line_10601'>a Cornish knight may match you. That is truth, said Sir Sagramore, that</a>
<a id='line_10602'>have we well proved; but I require thee, said Sir Sagramore, tell us</a>
<a id='line_10603'>your right name, by the faith and troth that ye owe to the high order</a>
<a id='line_10604'>of knighthood. Ye charge me with a great thing, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_10605'>sithen ye list to wit it, ye shall know and understand that my name is</a>
<a id='line_10606'>Sir Tristram de Liones, King Meliodas’ son, and nephew unto King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_10607'>Then were they two knights fain that they had met with Tristram, and so</a>
<a id='line_10608'>they prayed him to abide in their fellowship. Nay, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_10609'>for I must have ado with one of your fellows, his name is Sir Bleoberis</a>
<a id='line_10610'>de Ganis. God speed you well, said Sir Sagramore and Dodinas. Sir</a>
<a id='line_10611'>Tristram departed and rode onward on his way. And then was he ware</a>
<a id='line_10612'>before him in a valley where rode Sir Bleoberis, with Sir Segwarides’</a>
<a id='line_10613'>lady, that rode behind his squire upon a palfrey.</a>

<a id='line_10617'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Bleoberis for a lady,</a>
<a id='line_10618'>and how the lady was put to choice to whom she would go.</a>
<a id='line_10619'></a>
<a id='line_10620'>Then Sir Tristram rode more than a pace until that he had overtaken</a>
<a id='line_10621'>him. Then spake Sir Tristram: Abide, he said, Knight of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_10622'>bring again that lady, or deliver her to me. I will do neither, said</a>
<a id='line_10623'>Bleoberis, for I dread no Cornish knight so sore that me list to</a>
<a id='line_10624'>deliver her. Why, said Sir Tristram, may not a Cornish knight do as</a>
<a id='line_10625'>well as another knight? this same day two knights of your court within</a>
<a id='line_10626'>this three mile met with me, and or ever we departed they found a</a>
<a id='line_10627'>Cornish knight good enough for them both. What were their names? said</a>
<a id='line_10628'>Bleoberis. They told me, said Sir Tristram, that the one of them hight</a>
<a id='line_10629'>Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_10630'>said Sir Bleoberis, have ye met with them? so God me help, they were</a>
<a id='line_10631'>two good knights and men of great worship, and if ye have beat them</a>
<a id='line_10632'>both ye must needs be a good knight; but if it so be ye have beat them</a>
<a id='line_10633'>both, yet shall ye not fear me, but ye shall beat me or ever ye have</a>
<a id='line_10634'>this lady. Then defend you, said Sir Tristram. So they departed and</a>
<a id='line_10635'>came together like thunder, and either bare other down, horse and all,</a>
<a id='line_10636'>to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_10637'></a>
<a id='line_10638'>Then they avoided their horses, and lashed together eagerly with</a>
<a id='line_10639'>swords, and mightily, now tracing and traversing on the right hand and</a>
<a id='line_10640'>on the left hand more than two hours. And sometime they rushed together</a>
<a id='line_10641'>with such a might that they lay both grovelling on the ground. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10642'>Bleoberis de Ganis stert aback, and said thus: Now, gentle good knight,</a>
<a id='line_10643'>a while hold your hands, and let us speak together. Say what ye will,</a>
<a id='line_10644'>said Tristram, and I will answer you. Sir, said Bleoberis, I would wit</a>
<a id='line_10645'>of whence ye be, and of whom ye be come, and what is your name? So God</a>
<a id='line_10646'>me help, said Sir Tristram, I fear not to tell you my name. Wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_10647'>I am King Meliodas’ son, and my mother is King Mark’s sister, and my</a>
<a id='line_10648'>name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and King Mark is mine uncle. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_10649'>said Bleoberis, I am right glad of you, for ye are he that slew Marhaus</a>
<a id='line_10650'>the knight, hand for hand in an island, for the truage of Cornwall;</a>
<a id='line_10651'>also ye overcame Sir Palamides the good knight, at a tournament in an</a>
<a id='line_10652'>island, where ye beat Sir Gawaine and his nine fellows. So God me help,</a>
<a id='line_10653'>said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am the same knight; now I have</a>
<a id='line_10654'>told you my name, tell me yours with good will. Wit ye well that my</a>
<a id='line_10655'>name is Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and my brother hight Sir Blamore de</a>
<a id='line_10656'>Ganis, that is called a good knight, and we be sister’s children unto</a>
<a id='line_10657'>my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake, that we call one of the best knights of</a>
<a id='line_10658'>the world. That is truth, said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot is called</a>
<a id='line_10659'>peerless of courtesy and of knighthood; and for his sake, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10660'>Tristram, I will not with my good will fight no more with you, for the</a>
<a id='line_10661'>great love I have to Sir Launcelot du Lake. In good faith, said</a>
<a id='line_10662'>Bleoberis, as for me I will be loath to fight with you; but sithen ye</a>
<a id='line_10663'>follow me here to have this lady, I shall proffer you kindness,</a>
<a id='line_10664'>courtesy, and gentleness right here upon this ground. This lady shall</a>
<a id='line_10665'>be betwixt us both, and to whom that she will go, let him have her in</a>
<a id='line_10666'>peace. I will well, said Tristram, for, as I deem, she will leave you</a>
<a id='line_10667'>and come to me. Ye shall prove it anon, said Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_10668'></a>
<a id='line_10669'></a>
<a id='line_10670'></a>
<a id='line_10671'>CHAPTER XVIII. How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10672'>Bleoberis, and how she desired to go to her husband.</a>
<a id='line_10673'></a>
<a id='line_10674'>So when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10675'>Tristram: Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late thou wast</a>
<a id='line_10676'>the man in the world that I most loved and trusted, and I weened thou</a>
<a id='line_10677'>hadst loved me again above all ladies; but when thou sawest this knight</a>
<a id='line_10678'>lead me away thou madest no cheer to rescue me, but suffered my lord</a>
<a id='line_10679'>Segwarides ride after me; but until that time I weened thou haddest</a>
<a id='line_10680'>loved me, and therefore now I will leave thee, and never love thee</a>
<a id='line_10681'>more. And therewithal she went unto Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_10682'></a>
<a id='line_10683'>When Sir Tristram saw her do so he was wonderly wroth with that lady,</a>
<a id='line_10684'>and ashamed to come to the court. Sir Tristram, said Sir Bleoberis, ye</a>
<a id='line_10685'>are in the default, for I hear by this lady’s words she before this day</a>
<a id='line_10686'>trusted you above all earthly knights, and, as she saith, ye have</a>
<a id='line_10687'>deceived her, therefore wit ye well, there may no man hold that will</a>
<a id='line_10688'>away; and rather than ye should be heartily displeased with me I would</a>
<a id='line_10689'>ye had her, an she would abide with you. Nay, said the lady, so God me</a>
<a id='line_10690'>help I will never go with him; for he that I loved most I weened he had</a>
<a id='line_10691'>loved me. And therefore, Sir Tristram, she said, ride as thou came, for</a>
<a id='line_10692'>though thou haddest overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with thee</a>
<a id='line_10693'>never would I have gone. And I shall pray this knight so fair of his</a>
<a id='line_10694'>knighthood, that or ever he pass this country, that he will lead me to</a>
<a id='line_10695'>the abbey where my lord Sir Segwarides lieth. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_10696'>Bleoberis, I let you wit, good knight Sir Tristram, because King Mark</a>
<a id='line_10697'>gave me the choice of a gift in this court, and so this lady liked me</a>
<a id='line_10698'>best—notwithstanding, she is wedded and hath a lord, and I have</a>
<a id='line_10699'>fulfilled my quest, she shall be sent unto her husband again, and in</a>
<a id='line_10700'>especial most for your sake, Sir Tristram; and if she would go with you</a>
<a id='line_10701'>I would ye had her. I thank you, said Sir Tristram, but for her love I</a>
<a id='line_10702'>shall beware what manner a lady I shall love or trust; for had her</a>
<a id='line_10703'>lord, Sir Segwarides, been away from the court, I should have been the</a>
<a id='line_10704'>first that should have followed you; but sithen that ye have refused</a>
<a id='line_10705'>me, as I am true knight I shall her know passingly well that I shall</a>
<a id='line_10706'>love or trust. And so they took their leave one from the other and</a>
<a id='line_10707'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_10708'></a>
<a id='line_10709'>And so Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagil, and Sir Bleoberis rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_10710'>abbey where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there he delivered his</a>
<a id='line_10711'>lady, and departed as a noble knight; and when Sir Segwarides saw his</a>
<a id='line_10712'>lady, he was greatly comforted; and then she told him that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10713'>had done great battle with Sir Bleoberis, and caused him to bring her</a>
<a id='line_10714'>again. These words pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10715'>would do so much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark</a>
<a id='line_10716'>betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_10717'></a>
<a id='line_10718'></a>
<a id='line_10719'></a>
<a id='line_10720'>CHAPTER XIX. How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud toward</a>
<a id='line_10721'>Ireland, and how by fortune he arrived into England.</a>
<a id='line_10722'></a>
<a id='line_10723'>Then when this was done King Mark cast always in his heart how he might</a>
<a id='line_10724'>destroy Sir Tristram. And then he imagined in himself to send Sir</a>
<a id='line_10725'>Tristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud. For Sir Tristram had so</a>
<a id='line_10726'>praised her beauty and her goodness that King Mark said that he would</a>
<a id='line_10727'>wed her, whereupon he prayed Sir Tristram to take his way into Ireland</a>
<a id='line_10728'>for him on message. And all this was done to the intent to slay Sir</a>
<a id='line_10729'>Tristram. Notwithstanding, Sir Tristram would not refuse the message</a>
<a id='line_10730'>for no danger nor peril that might fall, for the pleasure of his uncle,</a>
<a id='line_10731'>but to go he made him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be</a>
<a id='line_10732'>devised. For Sir Tristram took with him the most goodliest knights that</a>
<a id='line_10733'>he might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise that</a>
<a id='line_10734'>was then used, in the goodliest manner. So Sir Tristram departed and</a>
<a id='line_10735'>took the sea with all his fellowship. And anon, as he was in the broad</a>
<a id='line_10736'>sea a tempest took him and his fellowship, and drove them back into the</a>
<a id='line_10737'>coast of England; and there they arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain</a>
<a id='line_10738'>they were to take the land.</a>
<a id='line_10739'></a>
<a id='line_10740'>And when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his pavilion upon the</a>
<a id='line_10741'>land of Camelot, and there he let hang his shield upon the pavilion.</a>
<a id='line_10742'>And that same day came two knights of King Arthur’s, that one was Sir</a>
<a id='line_10743'>Ector de Maris, and Sir Morganor. And they touched the shield, and bade</a>
<a id='line_10744'>him come out of the pavilion for to joust, an he would joust. Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_10745'>be answered, said Sir Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while. So he</a>
<a id='line_10746'>made him ready, and first he smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after</a>
<a id='line_10747'>he smote down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them.</a>
<a id='line_10748'>And when they lay upon the earth they asked Sir Tristram what he was,</a>
<a id='line_10749'>and of what country he was knight. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, wit</a>
<a id='line_10750'>ye well that I am of Cornwall. Alas, said Sir Ector, now am I ashamed</a>
<a id='line_10751'>that ever any Cornish knight should overcome me. And then for despite</a>
<a id='line_10752'>Sir Ector put off his armour from him, and went on foot, and would not</a>
<a id='line_10753'>ride.</a>
<a id='line_10754'></a>
<a id='line_10755'></a>
<a id='line_10756'></a>
<a id='line_10757'>CHAPTER XX. How King Anguish of Ireland was summoned to come to King</a>
<a id='line_10758'>Arthur’s court for treason.</a>
<a id='line_10759'></a>
<a id='line_10760'>Then it fell that Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamore de Ganis, that were</a>
<a id='line_10761'>brethren, they had summoned the King Anguish of Ireland for to come to</a>
<a id='line_10762'>Arthur’s court upon pain of forfeiture of King Arthur’s good grace. And</a>
<a id='line_10763'>if the King of Ireland came not in, at the day assigned and set, the</a>
<a id='line_10764'>king should lose his lands. So it happened that at the day assigned,</a>
<a id='line_10765'>King Arthur neither Sir Launcelot might not be there for to give the</a>
<a id='line_10766'>judgment, for King Arthur was with Sir Launcelot at the Castle Joyous</a>
<a id='line_10767'>Garde. And so King Arthur assigned King Carados and the King of Scots</a>
<a id='line_10768'>to be there that day as judges. So when the kings were at Camelot King</a>
<a id='line_10769'>Anguish of Ireland was come to know his accusers. Then was there Sir</a>
<a id='line_10770'>Blamore de Ganis, and appealed the King of Ireland of treason, that he</a>
<a id='line_10771'>had slain a cousin of his in his court in Ireland by treason. The king</a>
<a id='line_10772'>was sore abashed of his accusation, for-why he was come at the summons</a>
<a id='line_10773'>of King Arthur, and or he came at Camelot he wist not wherefore he was</a>
<a id='line_10774'>sent after. And when the king heard Sir Blamore say his will, he</a>
<a id='line_10775'>understood well there was none other remedy but for to answer him</a>
<a id='line_10776'>knightly; for the custom was such in those days, that an any man were</a>
<a id='line_10777'>appealed of any treason or murder he should fight body for body, or</a>
<a id='line_10778'>else to find another knight for him. And all manner of murders in those</a>
<a id='line_10779'>days were called treason.</a>
<a id='line_10780'></a>
<a id='line_10781'>So when King Anguish understood his accusing he was passing heavy, for</a>
<a id='line_10782'>he knew Sir Blamore de Ganis that he was a noble knight, and of noble</a>
<a id='line_10783'>knights come. Then the King of Ireland was simply purveyed of his</a>
<a id='line_10784'>answer; therefore the judges gave him respite by the third day to give</a>
<a id='line_10785'>his answer. So the king departed unto his lodging. The meanwhile there</a>
<a id='line_10786'>came a lady by Sir Tristram’s pavilion making great dole. What aileth</a>
<a id='line_10787'>you, said Sir Tristram, that ye make such dole? Ah, fair knight, said</a>
<a id='line_10788'>the lady, I am ashamed unless that some good knight help me; for a</a>
<a id='line_10789'>great lady of worship sent by me a fair child and a rich, unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10790'>Launcelot du Lake, and hereby there met with me a knight, and threw me</a>
<a id='line_10791'>down from my palfrey, and took away the child from me. Well, my lady,</a>
<a id='line_10792'>said Sir Tristram, and for my lord Sir Launcelot’s sake I shall get you</a>
<a id='line_10793'>that child again, or else I shall be beaten for it. And so Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10794'>took his horse, and asked the lady which way the knight rode; and then</a>
<a id='line_10795'>she told him. And he rode after him, and within a while he overtook</a>
<a id='line_10796'>that knight. And then Sir Tristram bade him turn and give again the</a>
<a id='line_10797'>child.</a>
<a id='line_10798'></a>
<a id='line_10799'></a>
<a id='line_10800'></a>
<a id='line_10801'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Tristram rescued a child from a knight, and how</a>
<a id='line_10802'>Gouvernail told him of King Anguish.</a>
<a id='line_10803'></a>
<a id='line_10804'>The knight turned his horse and made him ready to fight. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10805'>Tristram smote him with a sword such a buffet that he tumbled to the</a>
<a id='line_10806'>earth. And then he yielded him unto Sir Tristram. Then come thy way,</a>
<a id='line_10807'>said Sir Tristram, and bring the child to the lady again. So he took</a>
<a id='line_10808'>his horse meekly and rode with Sir Tristram; and then by the way Sir</a>
<a id='line_10809'>Tristram asked him his name. Then he said, My name is Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_10810'>Pité. So when he had delivered that child to the lady, he said: Sir, as</a>
<a id='line_10811'>in this the child is well remedied. Then Sir Tristram let him go again</a>
<a id='line_10812'>that sore repented him after, for he was a great foe unto many good</a>
<a id='line_10813'>knights of King Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_10814'></a>
<a id='line_10815'>Then when Sir Tristram was in his pavilion Gouvernail, his man, came</a>
<a id='line_10816'>and told him how that King Anguish of Ireland was come thither, and he</a>
<a id='line_10817'>was put in great distress; and there Gouvernail told Sir Tristram how</a>
<a id='line_10818'>King Anguish was summoned and appealed of murder. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_10819'>Sir Tristram, these be the best tidings that ever came to me this seven</a>
<a id='line_10820'>years, for now shall the King of Ireland have need of my help; for I</a>
<a id='line_10821'>daresay there is no knight in this country that is not of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_10822'>court dare do battle with Sir Blamore de Ganis; and for to win the love</a>
<a id='line_10823'>of the King of Ireland I will take the battle upon me; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_10824'>Gouvernail bring me, I charge thee, to the king.</a>
<a id='line_10825'></a>
<a id='line_10826'>Then Gouvernail went unto King Anguish of Ireland, and saluted him</a>
<a id='line_10827'>fair. The king welcomed him and asked him what he would. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_10828'>Gouvernail, here is a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you:</a>
<a id='line_10829'>he bade me say he would do you service. What knight is he? said the</a>
<a id='line_10830'>king. Sir, said he, it is Sir Tristram de Liones, that for your good</a>
<a id='line_10831'>grace that ye showed him in your lands will reward you in this country.</a>
<a id='line_10832'>Come on, fellow, said the king, with me anon and show me unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10833'>Tristram. So the king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with</a>
<a id='line_10834'>him, until he came unto Sir Tristram’s pavilion. And when Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10835'>saw the king he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup. But the</a>
<a id='line_10836'>king leapt from his horse lightly, and either halsed other in their</a>
<a id='line_10837'>arms. My gracious lord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your great</a>
<a id='line_10838'>goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at that time I</a>
<a id='line_10839'>promised you to do you service an ever it lay in my power. And, gentle</a>
<a id='line_10840'>knight, said the king unto Sir Tristram, now have I great need of you,</a>
<a id='line_10841'>never had I so great need of no knight’s help. How so, my good lord?</a>
<a id='line_10842'>said Sir Tristram. I shall tell you, said the king: I am summoned and</a>
<a id='line_10843'>appealed from my country for the death of a knight that was kin unto</a>
<a id='line_10844'>the good knight Sir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother</a>
<a id='line_10845'>to Sir Bleoberis hath appealed me to fight with him, outher to find a</a>
<a id='line_10846'>knight in my stead. And well I wot, said the king, these that are come</a>
<a id='line_10847'>of King Ban’s blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good</a>
<a id='line_10848'>knights, and hard men for to win in battle as any that I know now</a>
<a id='line_10849'>living. Sir, said Sir Tristram, for the good lordship ye showed me in</a>
<a id='line_10850'>Ireland, and for my lady your daughter’s sake, La Beale Isoud, I will</a>
<a id='line_10851'>take the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two</a>
<a id='line_10852'>things: that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right,</a>
<a id='line_10853'>that ye were never consenting to the knight’s death; Sir, then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10854'>Tristram, when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace that</a>
<a id='line_10855'>I speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that I</a>
<a id='line_10856'>will ask of you. So God me help, said the king, ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_10857'>whatsomever ye will ask. It is well said, said Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_10858'></a>
<a id='line_10859'></a>
<a id='line_10860'></a>
<a id='line_10861'>CHAPTER XXII. How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his</a>
<a id='line_10862'>adversary, and how his adversary would never yield him.</a>
<a id='line_10863'></a>
<a id='line_10864'>Now make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in</a>
<a id='line_10865'>your quarrel rather than to be recreant. I have no doubt of you, said</a>
<a id='line_10866'>the king, that, an ye should have ado with Sir Launcelot du Lake— Sir,</a>
<a id='line_10867'>said Sir Tristram, as for Sir Launcelot, he is called the noblest</a>
<a id='line_10868'>knight of the world, and wit ye well that the knights of his blood are</a>
<a id='line_10869'>noble men, and dread shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_10870'>Blamore, I have done battle with him, therefore upon my head it is no</a>
<a id='line_10871'>shame to call him a good knight. It is noised, said the king, that</a>
<a id='line_10872'>Blamore is the hardier knight. Sir, as for that let him be, he shall</a>
<a id='line_10873'>never be refused, an as he were the best knight that now beareth shield</a>
<a id='line_10874'>or spear.</a>
<a id='line_10875'></a>
<a id='line_10876'>So King Anguish departed unto King Carados and the kings that were that</a>
<a id='line_10877'>time as judges, and told them that he had found his champion ready.</a>
<a id='line_10878'>Then by the commandment of the kings Sir Blamore de Ganis and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10879'>Tristram were sent for to hear the charge. And when they were come</a>
<a id='line_10880'>before the judges there were many kings and knights beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_10881'>Tristram, and much speech they had of him because that he slew Sir</a>
<a id='line_10882'>Marhaus, the good knight, and because he for-jousted Sir Palamides the</a>
<a id='line_10883'>good knight. So when they had taken their charge they withdrew them to</a>
<a id='line_10884'>make them ready to do battle.</a>
<a id='line_10885'></a>
<a id='line_10886'>Then said Sir Bleoberis unto his brother, Sir Blamore: Fair dear</a>
<a id='line_10887'>brother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is Sir</a>
<a id='line_10888'>Launcelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother’s children,</a>
<a id='line_10889'>and there was never none of our kin that ever was shamed in battle; and</a>
<a id='line_10890'>rather suffer death, brother, than to be shamed. Brother, said Blamore,</a>
<a id='line_10891'>have ye no doubt of me, for I shall never shame none of my blood;</a>
<a id='line_10892'>howbeit I am sure that yonder knight is called a passing good knight as</a>
<a id='line_10893'>of his time one of the world, yet shall I never yield me, nor say the</a>
<a id='line_10894'>loath word: well may he happen to smite me down with his great might of</a>
<a id='line_10895'>chivalry, but rather shall he slay me than I shall yield me as</a>
<a id='line_10896'>recreant. God speed you well, said Sir Bleoberis, for ye shall find him</a>
<a id='line_10897'>the mightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him, for I</a>
<a id='line_10898'>have had ado with him. God me speed, said Sir Blamore de Ganis; and</a>
<a id='line_10899'>therewith he took his horse at the one end of the lists, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10900'>Tristram at the other end of the lists, and so they feutred their</a>
<a id='line_10901'>spears and came together as it had been thunder; and there Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_10902'>through great might smote down Sir Blamore and his horse to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_10903'>Then anon Sir Blamore avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and</a>
<a id='line_10904'>threw his shield afore him, and bade Sir Tristram alight: For though an</a>
<a id='line_10905'>horse hath failed me, I trust to God the earth will not fail me. And</a>
<a id='line_10906'>then Sir Tristram alighted, and dressed him unto battle; and there they</a>
<a id='line_10907'>lashed together strongly as racing and tracing, foining and dashing,</a>
<a id='line_10908'>many sad strokes, that the kings and knights had great wonder that they</a>
<a id='line_10909'>might stand; for ever they fought like wood men, so that there was</a>
<a id='line_10910'>never knights seen fight more fiercely than they did; for Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_10911'>was so hasty that he would have no rest, that all men wondered that</a>
<a id='line_10912'>they had breath to stand on their feet; and all the place was bloody</a>
<a id='line_10913'>that they fought in. And at the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_10914'>such a buffet upon the helm that he there fell down upon his side, and</a>
<a id='line_10915'>Sir Tristram stood and beheld him.</a>

<a id='line_10920'>Sir Tristram spared him, and how they took appointment.</a>

<a id='line_10922'>Then when Sir Blamore might speak, he said thus: Sir Tristram de</a>

<a id='line_10924'>that ever I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I would not live to</a>
<a id='line_10925'>be made lord of all the earth, for I have liefer die with worship than</a>
<a id='line_10926'>live with shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou must slay me, or else</a>
<a id='line_10927'>thou shalt never win the field, for I will never say the loath word.</a>
<a id='line_10928'>And therefore if thou dare slay me, slay me, I require thee. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_10929'>Tristram heard him say so knightly, he wist not what to do with him; he</a>
<a id='line_10930'>remembering him of both parties, of what blood he was come, and for Sir</a>
<a id='line_10931'>Launcelot’s sake he would be loath to slay him; and in the other party</a>
<a id='line_10932'>in no wise he might not choose, but that he must make him to say the</a>
<a id='line_10933'>loath word, or else to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_10934'></a>
<a id='line_10935'>Then Sir Tristram stert aback, and went to the kings that were judges,</a>
<a id='line_10936'>and there he kneeled down to-fore them, and besought them for their</a>
<a id='line_10937'>worships, and for King Arthur’s and Sir Launcelot’s sake, that they</a>
<a id='line_10938'>would take this matter in their hands. For, my fair lords, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10939'>Tristram, it were shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder</a>
<a id='line_10940'>lieth should be slain; for ye hear well, shamed will he not be, and I</a>
<a id='line_10941'>pray to God that he never be slain nor shamed for me. And as for the</a>
<a id='line_10942'>king for whom I fight for, I shall require him, as I am his true</a>
<a id='line_10943'>champion and true knight in this field, that he will have mercy upon</a>
<a id='line_10944'>this good knight. So God me help, said King Anguish, I will for your</a>
<a id='line_10945'>sake; Sir Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my</a>
<a id='line_10946'>true knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be here</a>
<a id='line_10947'>as judges to take it in their hands. And the kings that were judges</a>
<a id='line_10948'>called Sir Bleoberis to them, and asked him his advice. My lords, said</a>
<a id='line_10949'>Bleoberis, though my brother be beaten, and hath the worse through</a>
<a id='line_10950'>might of arms, I dare say, though Sir Tristram hath beaten his body he</a>
<a id='line_10951'>hath not beaten his heart, and I thank God he is not shamed this day;</a>
<a id='line_10952'>and rather than he should be shamed I require you, said Bleoberis, let</a>
<a id='line_10953'>Sir Tristram slay him out. It shall not be so, said the kings, for his</a>
<a id='line_10954'>part adversary, both the king and the champion, have pity of Sir</a>
<a id='line_10955'>Blamore’s knighthood. My lords, said Bleoberis, I will right well as ye</a>
<a id='line_10956'>will.</a>
<a id='line_10957'></a>
<a id='line_10958'>Then the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him goodly and</a>
<a id='line_10959'>treatable. And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_10960'>Bleoberis took up Sir Blamore, and the two brethren were accorded with</a>
<a id='line_10961'>King Anguish, and kissed and made friends for ever. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_10962'>Blamore and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their</a>
<a id='line_10963'>oaths that they would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10964'>Tristram, and Sir Tristram made the same oath. And for that gentle</a>
<a id='line_10965'>battle all the blood of Sir Launcelot loved Sir Tristram for ever.</a>
<a id='line_10966'></a>
<a id='line_10967'>Then King Anguish and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed into</a>
<a id='line_10968'>Ireland with great noblesse and joy. So when they were in Ireland the</a>
<a id='line_10969'>king let make it known throughout all the land how and in what manner</a>
<a id='line_10970'>Sir Tristram had done for him. Then the queen and all that there were</a>
<a id='line_10971'>made the most of him that they might. But the joy that La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_10972'>made of Sir Tristram there might no tongue tell, for of all men earthly</a>
<a id='line_10973'>she loved him most.</a>
<a id='line_10974'></a>
<a id='line_10975'></a>
<a id='line_10976'></a>
<a id='line_10977'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram demanded La Beale Isoud for King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_10978'>and how Sir Tristram and Isoud drank the love drink.</a>
<a id='line_10979'></a>
<a id='line_10980'>Then upon a day King Anguish asked Sir Tristram why he asked not his</a>
<a id='line_10981'>boon, for whatsomever he had promised him he should have it without</a>
<a id='line_10982'>fail. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now is it time; this is all that I will</a>
<a id='line_10983'>desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud, your daughter, not for</a>
<a id='line_10984'>myself, but for mine uncle, King Mark, that shall have her to wife, for</a>
<a id='line_10985'>so have I promised him. Alas, said the king, I had liefer than all the</a>
<a id='line_10986'>land that I have ye would wed her yourself. Sir, an I did then I were</a>
<a id='line_10987'>shamed for ever in this world, and false of my promise. Therefore, said</a>
<a id='line_10988'>Sir I Tristram, I pray you hold your promise that ye promised me; for</a>
<a id='line_10989'>this is my desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud to go with me</a>
<a id='line_10990'>into Cornwall for to be wedded to King Mark, mine uncle. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_10991'>said King Anguish, ye shall have her with you to do with her what it</a>
<a id='line_10992'>please you; that is for to say if that ye list to wed her yourself,</a>
<a id='line_10993'>that is me liefest, and if ye will give her unto King Mark, your uncle,</a>
<a id='line_10994'>that is in your choice. So, to make short conclusion, La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_10995'>was made ready to go with Sir Tristram, and Dame Bragwaine went with</a>
<a id='line_10996'>her for her chief gentlewoman, with many other.</a>
<a id='line_10997'></a>
<a id='line_10998'>Then the queen, Isoud’s mother, gave to her and Dame Bragwaine, her</a>
<a id='line_10999'>daughter’s gentlewoman, and unto Gouvernail, a drink, and charged them</a>
<a id='line_11000'>that what day King Mark should wed, that same day they should give him</a>
<a id='line_11001'>that drink, so that King Mark should drink to La Beale Isoud, and then,</a>
<a id='line_11002'>said the queen, I undertake either shall love other the days of their</a>
<a id='line_11003'>life. So this drink was given unto Dame Bragwaine, and unto Gouvernail.</a>
<a id='line_11004'>And then anon Sir Tristram took the sea, and La Beale Isoud; and when</a>
<a id='line_11005'>they were in their cabin, it happed so that they were thirsty, and they</a>
<a id='line_11006'>saw a little flasket of gold stand by them, and it seemed by the colour</a>
<a id='line_11007'>and the taste that it was noble wine. Then Sir Tristram took the</a>
<a id='line_11008'>flasket in his hand, and said, Madam Isoud, here is the best drink that</a>
<a id='line_11009'>ever ye drank, that Dame Bragwaine, your maiden, and Gouvernail, my</a>
<a id='line_11010'>servant, have kept for themselves. Then they laughed and made good</a>
<a id='line_11011'>cheer, and either drank to other freely, and they thought never drink</a>
<a id='line_11012'>that ever they drank to other was so sweet nor so good. But by that</a>
<a id='line_11013'>their drink was in their bodies, they loved either other so well that</a>
<a id='line_11014'>never their love departed for weal neither for woe. And thus it happed</a>
<a id='line_11015'>the love first betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, the which love</a>
<a id='line_11016'>never departed the days of their life.</a>
<a id='line_11017'></a>
<a id='line_11018'>So then they sailed till by fortune they came nigh a castle that hight</a>
<a id='line_11019'>Pluere, and thereby arrived for to repose them, weening to them to have</a>
<a id='line_11020'>had good harbourage. But anon as Sir Tristram was within the castle</a>
<a id='line_11021'>they were taken prisoners; for the custom of the castle was such; who</a>
<a id='line_11022'>that rode by that castle and brought any lady, he must needs fight with</a>
<a id='line_11023'>the lord, that hight Breunor. And if it were so that Breunor won the</a>
<a id='line_11024'>field, then should the knight stranger and his lady be put to death,</a>
<a id='line_11025'>what that ever they were; and if it were so that the strange knight won</a>
<a id='line_11026'>the field of Sir Breunor, then should he die and his lady both. This</a>
<a id='line_11027'>custom was used many winters, for it was called the Castle Pluere, that</a>
<a id='line_11028'>is to say the Weeping Castle.</a>
<a id='line_11029'></a>
<a id='line_11030'></a>
<a id='line_11031'></a>
<a id='line_11032'>CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he</a>
<a id='line_11033'>fought for her beauty, and smote off another lady’s head.</a>
<a id='line_11034'></a>
<a id='line_11035'>Thus as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed a</a>
<a id='line_11036'>knight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer them. I have</a>
<a id='line_11037'>marvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady, what is the cause</a>
<a id='line_11038'>the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison: it was never the custom</a>
<a id='line_11039'>of no place of worship that ever I came in, when a knight and a lady</a>
<a id='line_11040'>asked harbour, and they to receive them, and after to destroy them that</a>
<a id='line_11041'>be his guests. Sir, said the knight, this is the old custom of this</a>
<a id='line_11042'>castle, that when a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our</a>
<a id='line_11043'>lord, and he that is weaker must lose his head. And when that is done,</a>
<a id='line_11044'>if his lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord’s wife, she must</a>
<a id='line_11045'>lose her head: and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall</a>
<a id='line_11046'>the lady of this castle lose her head. So God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11047'>Tristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful. But one advantage have</a>
<a id='line_11048'>I, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair enough, fairer saw I never</a>
<a id='line_11049'>in all my life-days, and I doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not</a>
<a id='line_11050'>lose her head; and rather than I should lose my head I will fight for</a>
<a id='line_11051'>it on a fair field. Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord</a>
<a id='line_11052'>that I will be ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle,</a>
<a id='line_11053'>if it be so I may have my horse and mine armour. Sir, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_11054'>I undertake that your desire shall be sped right well. And then he</a>
<a id='line_11055'>said: Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make you ready</a>
<a id='line_11056'>and your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you behoveth. And</a>
<a id='line_11057'>therewith he departed, and on the morn betimes that same knight came to</a>
<a id='line_11058'>Sir Tristram, and fetched him out and his lady, and brought him horse</a>
<a id='line_11059'>and armour that was his own, and bade him make him ready to the field,</a>
<a id='line_11060'>for all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready to</a>
<a id='line_11061'>behold that battle and judgment.</a>
<a id='line_11062'></a>
<a id='line_11063'>Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in his</a>
<a id='line_11064'>hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: For an thy</a>
<a id='line_11065'>lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady’s head; and</a>
<a id='line_11066'>if my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I must strike off her</a>
<a id='line_11067'>head. And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_11068'>lose thy head. Sir, said Tristram, this is a foul custom and horrible;</a>
<a id='line_11069'>and rather than my lady should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose my</a>
<a id='line_11070'>head. Nay, nay, said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed</a>
<a id='line_11071'>together, and the one shall have her judgment. Nay, I will not so, said</a>
<a id='line_11072'>Sir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. But I</a>
<a id='line_11073'>doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine, and that</a>
<a id='line_11074'>will I prove and make good with my hand. And whosomever he be that will</a>
<a id='line_11075'>say the contrary I will prove it on his head. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_11076'>Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her thrice about with his</a>
<a id='line_11077'>naked sword in his hand. And when Sir Breunor saw that, he did the same</a>
<a id='line_11078'>wise turn his lady. But when Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him</a>
<a id='line_11079'>thought he saw never a fairer lady, and then he dread his lady’s head</a>
<a id='line_11080'>should be off. And so all the people that were there present gave</a>
<a id='line_11081'>judgment that La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made.</a>
<a id='line_11082'>How now, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should</a>
<a id='line_11083'>lose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used this</a>
<a id='line_11084'>wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and ladies been</a>
<a id='line_11085'>destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy you both. So God</a>
<a id='line_11086'>me help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the sooth, thy lady is fairer</a>
<a id='line_11087'>than mine, and that me sore repenteth. And so I hear the people privily</a>
<a id='line_11088'>say, for of all women I saw none so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_11089'>slay my lady, I doubt not but I shall slay thee and have thy lady. Thou</a>
<a id='line_11090'>shalt win her, said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady. And</a>
<a id='line_11091'>because of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if</a>
<a id='line_11092'>that she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me thy</a>
<a id='line_11093'>lady, said Sir Tristram. And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him</a>
<a id='line_11094'>and took his lady from him, and with an awk stroke he smote off her</a>
<a id='line_11095'>head clean. Well, knight, said Sir Breunor, now hast thou done me a</a>
<a id='line_11096'>despite.</a>
<a id='line_11097'></a>
<a id='line_11098'></a>
<a id='line_11099'></a>
<a id='line_11100'>CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the last</a>
<a id='line_11101'>smote off his head.</a>
<a id='line_11102'></a>
<a id='line_11103'>Now take thine horse: sithen I am ladyless I will win thy lady an I</a>
<a id='line_11104'>may.</a>
<a id='line_11105'></a>
<a id='line_11106'>Then they took their horses and came together as it had been the</a>
<a id='line_11107'>thunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_11108'>lightly he rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him he thrust his</a>
<a id='line_11109'>horse throughout both the shoulders, that his horse hurled here and</a>
<a id='line_11110'>there and fell dead to the ground. And ever Sir Breunor ran after to</a>
<a id='line_11111'>have slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram was light and nimble, and</a>
<a id='line_11112'>voided his horse lightly. And or ever Sir Tristram might dress his</a>
<a id='line_11113'>shield and his sword the other gave him three or four sad strokes. Then</a>
<a id='line_11114'>they rushed together like two boars, tracing and traversing mightily</a>
<a id='line_11115'>and wisely as two noble knights. For this Sir Breunor was a proved</a>
<a id='line_11116'>knight, and had been or then the death of many good knights, that it</a>
<a id='line_11117'>was pity that he had so long endured.</a>
<a id='line_11118'></a>
<a id='line_11119'>Thus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and either</a>
<a id='line_11120'>were wounded sore. Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_11121'>Tristram and took him in his arms, for he trusted much in his strength.</a>
<a id='line_11122'>Then was Sir Tristram called the strongest and the highest knight of</a>
<a id='line_11123'>the world; for he was called bigger than Sir Launcelot, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_11124'>Launcelot was better breathed. So anon Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor</a>
<a id='line_11125'>down grovelling, and then he unlaced his helm and struck off his head.</a>
<a id='line_11126'>And then all they that longed to the castle came to him, and did him</a>
<a id='line_11127'>homage and fealty, praying him that he would abide there still a little</a>
<a id='line_11128'>while to fordo that foul custom. Sir Tristram granted thereto. The</a>
<a id='line_11129'>meanwhile one of the knights of the castle rode unto Sir Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_11130'>haut prince, the which was Sir Breunor’s son, which was a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_11131'>and told him what misadventure his father had and his mother.</a>

<a id='line_11135'>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Galahad fought with Sir Tristram, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_11136'>Tristram yielded him and promised to fellowship with Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11137'></a>
<a id='line_11138'>Then came Sir Galahad, and the King with the Hundred Knights with him;</a>
<a id='line_11139'>and this Sir Galahad proffered to fight with Sir Tristram hand for</a>
<a id='line_11140'>hand. And so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with</a>
<a id='line_11141'>great courage. Then Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram met together so hard</a>
<a id='line_11142'>that either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth. And then they</a>
<a id='line_11143'>avoided their horses as noble knights, and dressed their shields, and</a>
<a id='line_11144'>drew their swords with ire and rancour, and they lashed together many</a>
<a id='line_11145'>sad strokes, and one while striking, another while foining, tracing and</a>
<a id='line_11146'>traversing as noble knights; thus they fought long, near half a day,</a>
<a id='line_11147'>and either were sore wounded. At the last Sir Tristram waxed light and</a>
<a id='line_11148'>big, and doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Galahad aback on the one</a>
<a id='line_11149'>side and on the other, so that he was like to have been slain.</a>
<a id='line_11150'></a>
<a id='line_11151'>With that came the King with the Hundred Knights, and all that</a>
<a id='line_11152'>fellowship went fiercely upon Sir Tristram. When Sir Tristram saw them</a>
<a id='line_11153'>coming upon him, then he wist well he might not endure. Then as a wise</a>
<a id='line_11154'>knight of war, he said to Sir Galahad, the haut prince: Sir, ye show to</a>
<a id='line_11155'>me no knighthood, for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at</a>
<a id='line_11156'>once; and as meseemeth ye be a noble knight of your hands it is great</a>
<a id='line_11157'>shame to you. So God me help, said Sir Galahad, there is none other way</a>
<a id='line_11158'>but thou must yield thee to me, other else to die, said Sir Galahad to</a>
<a id='line_11159'>Sir Tristram. I will rather yield me to you than die for that is more</a>
<a id='line_11160'>for the might of your men than of your hands. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_11161'>Tristram took his own sword by the point, and put the pommel in the</a>
<a id='line_11162'>hand of Sir Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_11163'></a>
<a id='line_11164'>Therewithal came the King with the Hundred Knights, and hard began to</a>
<a id='line_11165'>assail Sir Tristram. Let be, said Sir Galahad, be ye not so hardy to</a>
<a id='line_11166'>touch him, for I have given this knight his life. That is your shame,</a>
<a id='line_11167'>said the King with the Hundred Knights; hath he not slain your father</a>
<a id='line_11168'>and your mother? As for that, said Sir Galahad, I may not wite him</a>
<a id='line_11169'>greatly, for my father had him in prison, and enforced him to do battle</a>
<a id='line_11170'>with him; and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom,</a>
<a id='line_11171'>that what knight came there to ask harbour his lady must needs die but</a>
<a id='line_11172'>if she were fairer than my mother; and if my father overcame that</a>
<a id='line_11173'>knight he must needs die. This was a shameful custom and usage, a</a>
<a id='line_11174'>knight for his harbour-asking to have such harbourage. And for this</a>
<a id='line_11175'>custom I would never draw about him. So God me help, said the King,</a>
<a id='line_11176'>this was a shameful custom. Truly, said Sir Galahad, so seemed me; and</a>
<a id='line_11177'>meseemed it had been great pity that this knight should have been</a>
<a id='line_11178'>slain, for I dare say he is the noblest man that beareth life, but if</a>
<a id='line_11179'>it were Sir Launcelot du Lake. Now, fair knight, said Sir Galahad, I</a>
<a id='line_11180'>require thee tell me thy name, and of whence thou art, and whither thou</a>
<a id='line_11181'>wilt. Sir, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and from King</a>
<a id='line_11182'>Mark of Cornwall I was sent on message unto King Anguish of Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_11183'>for to fetch his daughter to be his wife, and here she is ready to go</a>
<a id='line_11184'>with me into Cornwall, and her name is La Beale Isoud. And, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11185'>Tristram, said Sir Galahad, the haut prince, well be ye found in these</a>
<a id='line_11186'>marches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir Launcelot du Lake,</a>
<a id='line_11187'>and accompany with him, ye shall go where ye will, and your fair lady</a>
<a id='line_11188'>with you; and I shall promise you never in all my days shall such</a>
<a id='line_11189'>customs be used in this castle as have been used. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11190'>Tristram, now I let you wit, so God me help, I weened ye had been Sir</a>
<a id='line_11191'>Launcelot du Lake when I saw you first, and therefore I dread you the</a>
<a id='line_11192'>more; and sir, I promise you, said Sir Tristram, as soon as I may I</a>
<a id='line_11193'>will see Sir Launcelot and in fellowship me with him; for of all the</a>
<a id='line_11194'>knights of the world I most desire his fellowship.</a>

<a id='line_11198'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away Sir</a>
<a id='line_11199'>Gawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_11200'></a>
<a id='line_11201'>And then Sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time, and took the</a>
<a id='line_11202'>sea. And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_11203'>Tristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was made like a giant,</a>
<a id='line_11204'>fought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such strokes that he swooned in</a>
<a id='line_11205'>his saddle, and after that he took him by the collar and pulled him out</a>
<a id='line_11206'>of his saddle, and fast bound him to the saddle-bow, and so rode his</a>
<a id='line_11207'>way with him toward his castle. And as he rode, by fortune Sir</a>
<a id='line_11208'>Launcelot met with Sir Carados, and anon he knew Sir Gawaine that lay</a>
<a id='line_11209'>bound after him. Ah, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it</a>
<a id='line_11210'>with you? Never so hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for</a>
<a id='line_11211'>so God me help, without ye rescue me I know no knight that may, but</a>
<a id='line_11212'>outher you or Sir Tristram. Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of Sir</a>
<a id='line_11213'>Gawaine’s words. And then Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: Lay down that</a>
<a id='line_11214'>knight and fight with me. Thou art but a fool, said Sir Carados, for I</a>
<a id='line_11215'>will serve you in the same wise. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, spare</a>
<a id='line_11216'>me not, for I warn thee I will not spare thee. And then he bound Sir</a>
<a id='line_11217'>Gawaine hand and foot, and so threw him to the ground. And then he gat</a>
<a id='line_11218'>his spear of his squire, and departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his</a>
<a id='line_11219'>course. And so either met with other, and brake their spears to their</a>
<a id='line_11220'>hands; and then they pulled out swords, and hurtled together on</a>
<a id='line_11221'>horseback more than an hour. And at the last Sir Launcelot smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_11222'>Carados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierced his brain-pan. So</a>
<a id='line_11223'>then Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by the collar and pulled him under</a>
<a id='line_11224'>his horse’s feet, and then he alighted and pulled off his helm and</a>
<a id='line_11225'>struck off his head. And then Sir Launcelot unbound Sir Gawaine. So</a>
<a id='line_11226'>this same tale was told to Sir Galahad and to Sir Tristram:—here may ye</a>
<a id='line_11227'>hear the nobleness that followeth Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11228'>Tristram, an I had not this message in hand with this fair lady, truly</a>
<a id='line_11229'>I would never stint or I had found Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_11230'>La Beale Isoud went to the sea and came into Cornwall, and there all</a>
<a id='line_11231'>the barons met them.</a>

<a id='line_11235'>CHAPTER XXIX. Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of</a>
<a id='line_11236'>Bragwaine her maid, and of Palamides.</a>
<a id='line_11237'></a>
<a id='line_11238'>And anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse. But ever, as the</a>
<a id='line_11239'>French book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved ever together.</a>
<a id='line_11240'>Then was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and</a>
<a id='line_11241'>ladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all</a>
<a id='line_11242'>other. Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within</a>
<a id='line_11243'>a little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen</a>
<a id='line_11244'>Isoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine,</a>
<a id='line_11245'>that was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the</a>
<a id='line_11246'>forest for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and</a>
<a id='line_11247'>hand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days. And by fortune, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11248'>Palamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he delivered her from the</a>
<a id='line_11249'>death, and brought her to a nunnery there beside, for to be recovered.</a>
<a id='line_11250'>When Isoud the queen missed her maiden, wit ye well she was right heavy</a>
<a id='line_11251'>as ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she loved her best: the</a>
<a id='line_11252'>cause was for she came with her out of her country. And so upon a day</a>
<a id='line_11253'>Queen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts, and there</a>
<a id='line_11254'>she went herself unto a well and made great moan. And suddenly there</a>
<a id='line_11255'>came Palamides to her, and had heard all her complaint, and said: Madam</a>
<a id='line_11256'>Isoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to you Dame Bragwaine</a>
<a id='line_11257'>safe and sound. And the queen was so glad of his proffer that suddenly</a>
<a id='line_11258'>unadvised she granted all his asking. Well, Madam, said Palamides, I</a>
<a id='line_11259'>trust to your promise, and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall</a>
<a id='line_11260'>bring her to you. I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_11261'>Palamides rode forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he came again</a>
<a id='line_11262'>with Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have come</a>
<a id='line_11263'>again, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of her</a>
<a id='line_11264'>life. Notwithstanding, half against her will, she went with Sir</a>
<a id='line_11265'>Palamides unto the queen. And when the queen saw her she was passing</a>
<a id='line_11266'>glad. Now, Madam, said Palamides, remember upon your promise, for I</a>
<a id='line_11267'>have fulfilled my promise. Sir Palamides, said the queen, I wot not</a>
<a id='line_11268'>what is your desire, but I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you</a>
<a id='line_11269'>largely, I thought none evil, nor I warn you none evil will I do.</a>
<a id='line_11270'>Madam, said Sir Palamides, as at this time, ye shall not know my</a>
<a id='line_11271'>desire, but before my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will</a>
<a id='line_11272'>have my desire that ye have promised me. And therewith the queen</a>
<a id='line_11273'>departed, and rode home to the king, and Sir Palamides rode after her.</a>
<a id='line_11274'>And when Sir Palamides came before the king, he said: Sir King, I</a>
<a id='line_11275'>require you as ye be a righteous king, that ye will judge me the right.</a>
<a id='line_11276'>Tell me your cause, said the king, and ye shall have right.</a>

<a id='line_11280'>CHAPTER XXX. How Palamides demanded Queen Isoud, and how Lambegus rode</a>
<a id='line_11281'>after to rescue her, and of the escape of Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_11282'></a>
<a id='line_11283'>Sir, said Palamides, I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again Dame</a>
<a id='line_11284'>Bragwaine that she had lost, upon this covenant, that she should grant</a>
<a id='line_11285'>me a boon that I would ask, and without grudging, outher advisement,</a>
<a id='line_11286'>she granted me. What say ye, my lady? said the king. It is as he saith,</a>
<a id='line_11287'>so God me help, said the queen; to say thee sooth I promised him his</a>
<a id='line_11288'>asking for love and joy that I had to see her. Well, Madam, said the</a>
<a id='line_11289'>king, and if ye were hasty to grant him what boon he would ask, I will</a>
<a id='line_11290'>well that ye perform your promise. Then, said Palamides, I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_11291'>wit that I will have your queen to lead her and govern her whereas me</a>
<a id='line_11292'>list. Therewith the king stood still, and bethought him of Sir</a>
<a id='line_11293'>Tristram, and deemed that he would rescue her. And then hastily the</a>
<a id='line_11294'>king answered: Take her with the adventures that shall fall of it, for</a>
<a id='line_11295'>as I suppose thou wilt not enjoy her no while. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_11296'>Palamides, I dare right well abide the adventure. And so, to make short</a>
<a id='line_11297'>tale, Sir Palamides took her by the hand and said: Madam, grudge not to</a>
<a id='line_11298'>go with me, for I desire nothing but your own promise. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_11299'>said the queen, I fear not greatly to go with thee, howbeit thou hast</a>
<a id='line_11300'>me at advantage upon my promise, for I doubt not I shall be</a>
<a id='line_11301'>worshipfully rescued from thee. As for that, said Sir Palamides, be it</a>
<a id='line_11302'>as it be may. So Queen Isoud was set behind Palamides, and rode his</a>
<a id='line_11303'>way.</a>
<a id='line_11304'></a>
<a id='line_11305'>Anon the king sent after Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could be</a>
<a id='line_11306'>found, for he was in the forest a-hunting; for that was always his</a>
<a id='line_11307'>custom, but if he used arms, to chase and to hunt in the forests. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_11308'>said the king, now I am shamed for ever, that by mine own assent my</a>
<a id='line_11309'>lady and my queen shall be devoured. Then came forth a knight, his name</a>
<a id='line_11310'>was Lambegus, and he was a knight of Sir Tristram. My lord, said this</a>
<a id='line_11311'>knight, sith ye have trust in my lord, Sir Tristram, wit ye well for</a>
<a id='line_11312'>his sake I will ride after your queen and rescue her, or else I shall</a>
<a id='line_11313'>be beaten. Gramercy, said the king, as I live, Sir Lambegus, I shall</a>
<a id='line_11314'>deserve it. And then Sir Lambegus armed him, and rode after as fast as</a>
<a id='line_11315'>he might. And then within a while he overtook Sir Palamides. And then</a>
<a id='line_11316'>Sir Palamides left the queen. What art thou, said Palamides, art thou</a>
<a id='line_11317'>Tristram? Nay, he said, I am his servant, and my name is Sir Lambegus.</a>
<a id='line_11318'>That me repenteth, said Palamides. I had liefer thou hadst been Sir</a>
<a id='line_11319'>Tristram. I believe you well, said Lambegus, but when thou meetest with</a>
<a id='line_11320'>Sir Tristram thou shalt have thy hands full. And then they hurtled</a>
<a id='line_11321'>together and all to-brast their spears, and then they pulled out their</a>
<a id='line_11322'>swords, and hewed on helms and hauberks. At the last Sir Palamides gave</a>
<a id='line_11323'>Sir Lambegus such a wound that he fell down like a dead knight to the</a>
<a id='line_11324'>earth.</a>
<a id='line_11325'></a>
<a id='line_11326'>Then he looked after La Beale Isoud, and then she was gone he nist</a>
<a id='line_11327'>where. Wit ye well Sir Palamides was never so heavy. So the queen ran</a>
<a id='line_11328'>into the forest, and there she found a well, and therein she had</a>
<a id='line_11329'>thought to have drowned herself. And as good fortune would, there came</a>
<a id='line_11330'>a knight to her that had a castle thereby, his name was Sir Adtherp.</a>
<a id='line_11331'>And when he found the queen in that mischief he rescued her, and</a>
<a id='line_11332'>brought her to his castle. And when he wist what she was he armed him,</a>
<a id='line_11333'>and took his horse, and said he would be avenged upon Palamides; and so</a>
<a id='line_11334'>he rode on till he met with him, and there Sir Palamides wounded him</a>
<a id='line_11335'>sore, and by force he made him to tell him the cause why he did battle</a>
<a id='line_11336'>with him, and how he had led the queen unto his castle. Now bring me</a>
<a id='line_11337'>there, said Palamides, or thou shalt die of my hands. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11338'>Adtherp, I am so wounded I may not follow, but ride you this way and it</a>
<a id='line_11339'>shall bring you into my castle, and there within is the queen. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_11340'>Palamides rode still till he came to the castle. And at a window La</a>
<a id='line_11341'>Beale Isoud saw Sir Palamides; then she made the gates to be shut</a>
<a id='line_11342'>strongly. And when he saw he might not come within the castle, he put</a>
<a id='line_11343'>off his bridle and his saddle, and put his horse to pasture, and set</a>
<a id='line_11344'>himself down at the gate like a man that was out of his wit that recked</a>
<a id='line_11345'>not of himself.</a>

<a id='line_11351'></a>
<a id='line_11352'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he was come home and wist La</a>
<a id='line_11353'>Beale Isoud was gone with Sir Palamides, wit ye well he was wroth out</a>
<a id='line_11354'>of measure. Alas, said Sir Tristram, I am this day shamed. Then he</a>
<a id='line_11355'>cried to Gouvernail his man: Haste thee that I were armed and on</a>
<a id='line_11356'>horseback, for well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to</a>
<a id='line_11357'>withstand Sir Palamides: alas that I have not been in his stead! So</a>
<a id='line_11358'>anon as he was armed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after</a>
<a id='line_11359'>into the forest, and within a while he found his knight Lambegus almost</a>
<a id='line_11360'>wounded to the death; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester, and</a>
<a id='line_11361'>charged him to keep him well. And then he rode forth, and there he</a>
<a id='line_11362'>found Sir Adtherp sore wounded, and he told him how the queen would</a>
<a id='line_11363'>have drowned herself had he not been, and how for her sake and love he</a>
<a id='line_11364'>had taken upon him to do battle with Sir Palamides. Where is my lady?</a>
<a id='line_11365'>said Sir Tristram. Sir, said the knight, she is sure enough within my</a>
<a id='line_11366'>castle, an she can hold her within it. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of</a>
<a id='line_11367'>thy great goodness. And so he rode till he came nigh to that castle;</a>
<a id='line_11368'>and then Sir Tristram saw where Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping,</a>
<a id='line_11369'>and his horse pastured fast afore him. Now go thou, Gouvernail, said</a>
<a id='line_11370'>Sir Tristram, and bid him awake, and make him ready. So Gouvernail rode</a>
<a id='line_11371'>unto him and said: Sir Palamides, arise, and take to thee thine</a>
<a id='line_11372'>harness. But he was in such a study he heard not what Gouvernail said.</a>
<a id='line_11373'>So Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram he slept, or else he was</a>
<a id='line_11374'>mad. Go thou again, said Sir Tristram, and bid him arise, and tell him</a>
<a id='line_11375'>that I am here, his mortal foe. So Gouvernail rode again and put upon</a>
<a id='line_11376'>him the butt of his spear, and said: Sir Palamides, make thee ready,</a>
<a id='line_11377'>for wit ye well Sir Tristram hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is</a>
<a id='line_11378'>thy mortal foe. And therewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without</a>
<a id='line_11379'>words, and gat his horse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_11380'>he leapt upon, and gat his spear in his hand, and either feutred their</a>
<a id='line_11381'>spears and hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_11382'>Palamides over his horse’s tail. Then lightly Sir Palamides put his</a>
<a id='line_11383'>shield afore him and drew his sword. And there began strong battle on</a>
<a id='line_11384'>both parts, for both they fought for the love of one lady, and ever she</a>
<a id='line_11385'>lay on the walls and beheld them how they fought out of measure, and</a>
<a id='line_11386'>either were wounded passing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded.</a>
<a id='line_11387'>Thus they fought tracing and traversing more than two hours, that</a>
<a id='line_11388'>well-nigh for dole and sorrow La Beale Isoud swooned. Alas, she said,</a>
<a id='line_11389'>that one I loved and yet do, and the other I love not, yet it were</a>
<a id='line_11390'>great pity that I should see Sir Palamides slain; for well I know by</a>
<a id='line_11391'>that time the end be done Sir Palamides is but a dead knight: because</a>
<a id='line_11392'>he is not christened I would be loath that he should die a Saracen. And</a>
<a id='line_11393'>therewithal she came down and besought Sir Tristram to fight no more.</a>
<a id='line_11394'>Ah, madam, said he, what mean you, will ye have me shamed? Well ye know</a>
<a id='line_11395'>I will be ruled by you. I will not your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud,</a>
<a id='line_11396'>but I would that ye would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen</a>
<a id='line_11397'>Palamides. Madam, said Sir Tristram, I will leave fighting at this time</a>
<a id='line_11398'>for your sake. Then she said to Sir Palamides: This shall be your</a>
<a id='line_11399'>charge, that thou shalt go out of this country while I am therein. I</a>
<a id='line_11400'>will obey your commandment, said Sir Palamides, the which is sore</a>
<a id='line_11401'>against my will. Then take thy way, said La Beale Isoud, unto the court</a>
<a id='line_11402'>of King Arthur, and there recommend me unto Queen Guenever, and tell</a>
<a id='line_11403'>her that I send her word that there be within this land but four</a>

<a id='line_11412'>And so Sir Palamides departed with great heaviness. And Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11413'>took the queen and brought her again to King Mark, and then was there</a>
<a id='line_11414'>made great joy of her home-coming. Who was cherished but Sir Tristram!</a>
<a id='line_11415'>Then Sir Tristram let fetch Sir Lambegus, his knight, from the</a>
<a id='line_11416'>forester’s house, and it was long or he was whole, but at the last he</a>
<a id='line_11417'>was well recovered. Thus they lived with joy and play a long while. But</a>
<a id='line_11418'>ever Sir Andred, that was nigh cousin to Sir Tristram, lay in a watch</a>
<a id='line_11419'>to wait betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, for to take them and</a>
<a id='line_11420'>slander them. So upon a day Sir Tristram talked with La Beale Isoud in</a>
<a id='line_11421'>a window, and that espied Sir Andred, and told it to the King. Then</a>
<a id='line_11422'>King Mark took a sword in his hand and came to Sir Tristram, and called</a>
<a id='line_11423'>him false traitor, and would have stricken him. But Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_11424'>nigh him, and ran under his sword, and took it out of his hand. And</a>
<a id='line_11425'>then the King cried: Where are my knights and my men? I charge you slay</a>
<a id='line_11426'>this traitor. But at that time there was not one would move for his</a>
<a id='line_11427'>words. When Sir Tristram saw that there was not one would be against</a>
<a id='line_11428'>him, he shook the sword to the king, and made countenance as though he</a>
<a id='line_11429'>would have stricken him. And then King Mark fled, and Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11430'>followed him, and smote upon him five or six strokes flatling on the</a>
<a id='line_11431'>neck, that he made him to fall upon the nose. And then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11432'>yede his way and armed him, and took his horse and his man, and so he</a>
<a id='line_11433'>rode into that forest.</a>
<a id='line_11434'></a>
<a id='line_11435'>And there upon a day Sir Tristram met with two brethren that were</a>
<a id='line_11436'>knights with King Mark, and there he struck off the head of the one,</a>
<a id='line_11437'>and wounded the other to the death; and he made him to bear his</a>
<a id='line_11438'>brother’s head in his helm unto the king, and thirty more there he</a>
<a id='line_11439'>wounded. And when that knight came before the king to say his message,</a>
<a id='line_11440'>he there died afore the king and the queen. Then King Mark called his</a>
<a id='line_11441'>council unto him, and asked advice of his barons what was best to do</a>
<a id='line_11442'>with Sir Tristram. Sir, said the barons, in especial Sir Dinas, the</a>
<a id='line_11443'>Seneschal, Sir, we will give you counsel for to send for Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_11444'>for we will that ye wit many men will hold with Sir Tristram an he were</a>
<a id='line_11445'>hard bestead. And sir, said Sir Dinas, ye shall understand that Sir</a>
<a id='line_11446'>Tristram is called peerless and makeless of any Christian knight, and</a>
<a id='line_11447'>of his might and hardiness we knew none so good a knight, but if it be</a>
<a id='line_11448'>Sir Launcelot du Lake. And if he depart from your court and go to King</a>
<a id='line_11449'>Arthur’s court, wit ye well he will get him such friends there that he</a>
<a id='line_11450'>will not set by your malice. And therefore, sir, I counsel you to take</a>
<a id='line_11451'>him to your grace. I will well, said the king, that he be sent for,</a>
<a id='line_11452'>that we may be friends. Then the barons sent for Sir Tristram under a</a>
<a id='line_11453'>safe conduct. And so when Sir Tristram came to the king he was welcome,</a>
<a id='line_11454'>and no rehearsal was made, and there was game and play. And then the</a>
<a id='line_11455'>king and the queen went a-hunting, and Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_11456'></a>
<a id='line_11457'></a>
<a id='line_11458'></a>
<a id='line_11459'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11460'>Tristram at the request of King Mark smote his horse down.</a>
<a id='line_11461'></a>
<a id='line_11462'>The king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in that</a>
<a id='line_11463'>forest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and jousting, for</a>
<a id='line_11464'>there were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto all them that came</a>
<a id='line_11465'>in at that time. And there by fortune came Sir Lamorak de Galis and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11466'>Driant; and there Sir Driant jousted right well, but at the last he had</a>
<a id='line_11467'>a fall. Then Sir Lamorak proffered to joust. And when he began he fared</a>
<a id='line_11468'>so with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he</a>
<a id='line_11469'>gave him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt. I marvel, said King</a>
<a id='line_11470'>Mark, what knight he is that doth such deeds of arms. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11471'>Tristram, I know him well for a noble knight as few now be living, and</a>
<a id='line_11472'>his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. It were great shame, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_11473'>that he should go thus away, unless that some of you meet with him</a>
<a id='line_11474'>better. Sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were no worship for a</a>
<a id='line_11475'>noble man to have ado with him: and for because at this time he hath</a>
<a id='line_11476'>done over much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it</a>
<a id='line_11477'>were great shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time,</a>
<a id='line_11478'>insomuch as he and his horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that</a>
<a id='line_11479'>he hath done this day, an they be well considered, it were enough for</a>
<a id='line_11480'>Sir Launcelot du Lake. As for that, said King Mark, I require you, as</a>
<a id='line_11481'>ye love me and my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and</a>
<a id='line_11482'>joust with Sir Lamorak de Galis. Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a</a>
<a id='line_11483'>thing that is against knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give</a>
<a id='line_11484'>him a fall, for it is no mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and</a>
<a id='line_11485'>so is not his horse and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for</a>
<a id='line_11486'>great unkindness, for ever one good knight is loath to take another at</a>
<a id='line_11487'>disadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require me so</a>
<a id='line_11488'>will I do, and obey your commandment.</a>
<a id='line_11489'></a>
<a id='line_11490'>And so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him forth,</a>
<a id='line_11491'>and there Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the might of his</a>
<a id='line_11492'>own spear, and of Sir Tristram’s spear, Sir Lamorak’s horse fell to the</a>
<a id='line_11493'>earth, and he sitting in the saddle. Then anon as lightly as he might</a>
<a id='line_11494'>he avoided the saddle and his horse, and put his shield afore him and</a>
<a id='line_11495'>drew his sword. And then he bade Sir Tristram: Alight, thou knight, an</a>
<a id='line_11496'>thou durst. Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will no more have ado with thee,</a>
<a id='line_11497'>for I have done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship.</a>
<a id='line_11498'>As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I can thee no thank; since thou hast</a>
<a id='line_11499'>for-jousted me on horseback I require thee and I beseech thee, an thou</a>
<a id='line_11500'>be Sir Tristram, fight with me on foot. I will not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11501'>Tristram; and wit ye well my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and well I</a>
<a id='line_11502'>know ye be Sir Lamorak de Galis, and this that I have done to you was</a>
<a id='line_11503'>against my will, but I was required thereto; but to say that I will do</a>
<a id='line_11504'>at your request as at this time, I will have no more ado with you, for</a>
<a id='line_11505'>me shameth of that I have done. As for the shame, said Sir Lamorak, on</a>
<a id='line_11506'>thy part or on mine, bear thou it an thou wilt, for though a mare’s son</a>
<a id='line_11507'>hath failed me, now a queen’s son shall not fail thee; and therefore,</a>
<a id='line_11508'>an thou be such a knight as men call thee, I require thee, alight, and</a>
<a id='line_11509'>fight with me. Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, I understand your heart</a>
<a id='line_11510'>is great, and cause why ye have, to say thee sooth; for it would grieve</a>
<a id='line_11511'>me an any knight should keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary</a>
<a id='line_11512'>knight, for that knight nor horse was never formed that alway might</a>
<a id='line_11513'>stand or endure. And therefore, said Sir Tristram, I will not have ado</a>
<a id='line_11514'>with you, for me forthinketh of that I have done. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11515'>Lamorak, I shall quit you, an ever I see my time.</a>
<a id='line_11516'></a>
<a id='line_11517'></a>
<a id='line_11518'></a>
<a id='line_11519'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Lamorak sent an horn to King Mark in despite of</a>
<a id='line_11520'>Sir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram was driven into a chapel.</a>
<a id='line_11521'></a>
<a id='line_11522'>So he departed from him with Sir Driant, and by the way they met with a</a>
<a id='line_11523'>knight that was sent from Morgan le Fay unto King Arthur; and this</a>
<a id='line_11524'>knight had a fair horn harnessed with gold, and the horn had such a</a>
<a id='line_11525'>virtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink of that horn but</a>
<a id='line_11526'>if she were true to her husband, and if she were false she should spill</a>
<a id='line_11527'>all the drink, and if she were true to her lord she might drink</a>
<a id='line_11528'>peaceable. And because of the Queen Guenever, and in the despite of Sir</a>
<a id='line_11529'>Launcelot, this horn was sent unto King Arthur; and by force Sir</a>
<a id='line_11530'>Lamorak made that knight to tell all the cause why he bare that horn.</a>
<a id='line_11531'>Now shalt thou bear this horn, said Lamorak, unto King Mark, or else</a>
<a id='line_11532'>choose thou to die for it; for I tell thee plainly, in despite and</a>
<a id='line_11533'>reproof of Sir Tristram thou shalt bear that horn unto King Mark, his</a>
<a id='line_11534'>uncle, and say thou to him that I sent it him for to assay his lady,</a>
<a id='line_11535'>and if she be true to him he shall prove her. So the knight went his</a>
<a id='line_11536'>way unto King Mark, and brought him that rich horn, and said that Sir</a>
<a id='line_11537'>Lamorak sent it him, and thereto he told him the virtue of that horn.</a>
<a id='line_11538'>Then the king made Queen Isoud to drink thereof, and an hundred ladies,</a>
<a id='line_11539'>and there were but four ladies of all those that drank clean. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_11540'>said King Mark, this is a great despite, and sware a great oath that</a>
<a id='line_11541'>she should be burnt and the other ladies.</a>
<a id='line_11542'></a>
<a id='line_11543'>Then the barons gathered them together, and said plainly they would not</a>
<a id='line_11544'>have those ladies burnt for an horn made by sorcery, that came from as</a>
<a id='line_11545'>false a sorceress and witch as then was living. For that horn did never</a>
<a id='line_11546'>good, but caused strife and debate, and always in her days she had been</a>
<a id='line_11547'>an enemy to all true lovers. So there were many knights made their</a>
<a id='line_11548'>avow, an ever they met with Morgan le Fay, that they would show her</a>
<a id='line_11549'>short courtesy. Also Sir Tristram was passing wroth that Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11550'>sent that horn unto King Mark, for well he knew that it was done in the</a>
<a id='line_11551'>despite of him. And therefore he thought to quite Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_11552'></a>
<a id='line_11553'>Then Sir Tristram used daily and nightly to go to Queen Isoud when he</a>
<a id='line_11554'>might, and ever Sir Andred his cousin watched him night and day for to</a>
<a id='line_11555'>take him with La Beale Isoud. And so upon a night Sir Andred espied the</a>
<a id='line_11556'>hour and the time when Sir Tristram went to his lady. Then Sir Andred</a>
<a id='line_11557'>gat unto him twelve knights, and at midnight he set upon Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11558'>secretly and suddenly and there Sir Tristram was taken naked abed with</a>
<a id='line_11559'>La Beale Isoud, and then was he bound hand and foot, and so was he kept</a>
<a id='line_11560'>until day. And then by the assent of King Mark, and of Sir Andred, and</a>
<a id='line_11561'>of some of the barons, Sir Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood</a>
<a id='line_11562'>upon the sea rocks, there for to take his judgment: and so he was led</a>
<a id='line_11563'>bounden with forty knights. And when Sir Tristram saw that there was</a>
<a id='line_11564'>none other boot but needs that he must die, then said he: Fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_11565'>remember what I have done for the country of Cornwall, and in what</a>
<a id='line_11566'>jeopardy I have been in for the weal of you all; for when I fought for</a>
<a id='line_11567'>the truage of Cornwall with Sir Marhaus, the good knight, I was</a>
<a id='line_11568'>promised for to be better rewarded, when ye all refused to take the</a>
<a id='line_11569'>battle; therefore, as ye be good gentle knights, see me not thus</a>
<a id='line_11570'>shamefully to die, for it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me</a>
<a id='line_11571'>die; for I dare say, said Sir Tristram, that I never met with no knight</a>
<a id='line_11572'>but I was as good as he, or better. Fie upon thee, said Sir Andred,</a>
<a id='line_11573'>false traitor that thou art, with thine avaunting; for all thy boast</a>
<a id='line_11574'>thou shalt die this day. O Andred, Andred, said Sir Tristram, thou</a>
<a id='line_11575'>shouldst be my kinsman, and now thou art to me full unfriendly, but an</a>
<a id='line_11576'>there were no more but thou and I, thou wouldst not put me to death.</a>
<a id='line_11577'>No! said Sir Andred, and therewith he drew his sword, and would have</a>
<a id='line_11578'>slain him.</a>
<a id='line_11579'></a>
<a id='line_11580'>When Sir Tristram saw him make such countenance he looked upon both his</a>
<a id='line_11581'>hands that were fast bounden unto two knights, and suddenly he pulled</a>
<a id='line_11582'>them both to him, and unwrast his hands, and then he leapt unto his</a>
<a id='line_11583'>cousin, Sir Andred, and wrested his sword out of his hands; then he</a>
<a id='line_11584'>smote Sir Andred that he fell to the earth, and so Sir Tristram fought</a>
<a id='line_11585'>till that he had killed ten knights. So then Sir Tristram gat the</a>
<a id='line_11586'>chapel and kept it mightily. Then the cry was great, and the people</a>
<a id='line_11587'>drew fast unto Sir Andred, mo than an hundred. When Sir Tristram saw</a>
<a id='line_11588'>the people draw unto him, he remembered he was naked, and sperd fast</a>
<a id='line_11589'>the chapel door, and brake the bars of a window, and so he leapt out</a>
<a id='line_11590'>and fell upon the crags in the sea. And so at that time Sir Andred nor</a>
<a id='line_11591'>none of his fellows might get to him, at that time.</a>
<a id='line_11592'></a>
<a id='line_11593'></a>
<a id='line_11594'></a>
<a id='line_11595'>CHAPTER XXXV. How Sir Tristram was holpen by his men, and of Queen</a>
<a id='line_11596'>Isoud which was put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_11597'></a>
<a id='line_11598'>So when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11599'>Sentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram’s men, sought their</a>
<a id='line_11600'>master. When they heard he was escaped then they were passing glad; and</a>
<a id='line_11601'>on the rocks they found him, and with towels they pulled him up. And</a>
<a id='line_11602'>then Sir Tristram asked them where was La Beale Isoud, for he weened</a>
<a id='line_11603'>she had been had away of Andred’s people. Sir, said Gouvernail, she is</a>
<a id='line_11604'>put in a lazar-cote. Alas, said Sir Tristram, this is a full ungoodly</a>
<a id='line_11605'>place for such a fair lady, and if I may she shall not be long there.</a>
<a id='line_11606'>And so he took his men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and fetched</a>
<a id='line_11607'>her away, and brought her into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11608'>Tristram there abode with her. So the good knight bade his men go from</a>
<a id='line_11609'>him: For at this time I may not help you. So they departed all save</a>
<a id='line_11610'>Gouvernail. And so upon a day Sir Tristram yede into the forest for to</a>
<a id='line_11611'>disport him, and then it happened that there he fell sleep; and there</a>
<a id='line_11612'>came a man that Sir Tristram aforehand had slain his brother, and when</a>
<a id='line_11613'>this man had found him he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow,</a>
<a id='line_11614'>and Sir Tristram leapt up and killed that man. And in the meantime it</a>
<a id='line_11615'>was told King Mark how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in that</a>
<a id='line_11616'>same manor, and as soon as ever he might thither he came with many</a>
<a id='line_11617'>knights to slay Sir Tristram. And when he came there he found him gone;</a>
<a id='line_11618'>and there he took La Beale Isoud home with him, and kept her strait</a>
<a id='line_11619'>that by no means never she might wit nor send unto Tristram, nor he</a>
<a id='line_11620'>unto her. And then when Sir Tristram came toward the old manor he found</a>
<a id='line_11621'>the track of many horses, and thereby he wist his lady was gone. And</a>
<a id='line_11622'>then Sir Tristram took great sorrow, and endured with great pain long</a>
<a id='line_11623'>time, for the arrow that he was hurt withal was envenomed.</a>
<a id='line_11624'></a>
<a id='line_11625'>Then by the mean of La Beale Isoud she told a lady that was cousin unto</a>
<a id='line_11626'>Dame Bragwaine, and she came to Sir Tristram, and told him that he</a>
<a id='line_11627'>might not be whole by no means. For thy lady, La Beale Isoud, may not</a>
<a id='line_11628'>help thee, therefore she biddeth you haste into Brittany to King Howel,</a>
<a id='line_11629'>and there ye shall find his daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she</a>
<a id='line_11630'>shall help thee. Then Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping,</a>
<a id='line_11631'>and so sailed into Brittany. And when King Howel wist that it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_11632'>Tristram he was full glad of him. Sir, he said, I am come into this</a>
<a id='line_11633'>country to have help of your daughter, for it is told me that there is</a>
<a id='line_11634'>none other may heal me but she; and so within a while she healed him.</a>
<a id='line_11635'></a>
<a id='line_11636'></a>
<a id='line_11637'></a>
<a id='line_11638'>CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram served in war King Howel of Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_11639'>and slew his adversary in the field.</a>
<a id='line_11640'></a>
<a id='line_11641'>There was an earl that hight Grip, and this earl made great war upon</a>
<a id='line_11642'>the king, and put the king to the worse, and besieged him. And on a</a>
<a id='line_11643'>time Sir Kehydius, that was son to King Howel, as he issued out he was</a>
<a id='line_11644'>sore wounded, nigh to the death. Then Gouvernail went to the king and</a>
<a id='line_11645'>said: Sir, I counsel you to desire my lord, Sir Tristram, as in your</a>
<a id='line_11646'>need to help you. I will do by your counsel, said the king. And so he</a>
<a id='line_11647'>yede unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him in his wars to help him: For my</a>
<a id='line_11648'>son, Sir Kehydius, may not go into the field. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_11649'>will go to the field and do what I may. Then Sir Tristram issued out of</a>
<a id='line_11650'>the town with such fellowship as he might make, and did such deeds that</a>
<a id='line_11651'>all Brittany spake of him. And then, at the last, by great might and</a>
<a id='line_11652'>force, he slew the Earl Grip with his own hands, and more than an</a>
<a id='line_11653'>hundred knights he slew that day. And then Sir Tristram was received</a>
<a id='line_11654'>worshipfully with procession. Then King Howel embraced him in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_11655'>and said: Sir Tristram, all my kingdom I will resign to thee. God</a>
<a id='line_11656'>defend, said Sir Tristram, for I am beholden unto you for your</a>
<a id='line_11657'>daughter’s sake to do for you.</a>
<a id='line_11658'></a>
<a id='line_11659'>Then by the great means of King Howel and Kehydius his son, by great</a>
<a id='line_11660'>proffers, there grew great love betwixt Isoud and Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_11661'>that lady was both good and fair, and a woman of noble blood and fame.</a>
<a id='line_11662'>And for because Sir Tristram had such cheer and riches, and all other</a>
<a id='line_11663'>pleasaunce that he had, almost he had forsaken La Beale Isoud. And so</a>
<a id='line_11664'>upon a time Sir Tristram agreed to wed Isoud la Blanche Mains. And at</a>
<a id='line_11665'>the last they were wedded, and solemnly held their marriage. And so</a>
<a id='line_11666'>when they were abed both Sir Tristram remembered him of his old lady La</a>
<a id='line_11667'>Beale Isoud. And then he took such a thought suddenly that he was all</a>
<a id='line_11668'>dismayed, and other cheer made he none but with clipping and kissing;</a>
<a id='line_11669'>as for other fleshly lusts Sir Tristram never thought nor had ado with</a>
<a id='line_11670'>her: such mention maketh the French book; also it maketh mention that</a>
<a id='line_11671'>the lady weened there had been no pleasure but kissing and clipping.</a>
<a id='line_11672'>And in the meantime there was a knight in Brittany, his name was</a>
<a id='line_11673'>Suppinabiles, and he came over the sea into England, and then he came</a>
<a id='line_11674'>into the court of King Arthur, and there he met with Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_11675'>Lake, and told him of the marriage of Sir Tristram. Then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11676'>Launcelot: Fie upon him, untrue knight to his lady, that so noble a</a>
<a id='line_11677'>knight as Sir Tristram is should be found to his first lady false, La</a>
<a id='line_11678'>Beale Isoud, Queen of Cornwall; but say ye him this, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11679'>Launcelot, that of all knights in the world I loved him most, and had</a>
<a id='line_11680'>most joy of him, and all was for his noble deeds; and let him wit the</a>
<a id='line_11681'>love between him and me is done for ever, and that I give him warning</a>
<a id='line_11682'>from this day forth as his mortal enemy.</a>

<a id='line_11689'>Then departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he found</a>
<a id='line_11690'>Sir Tristram, and told him that he had been in King Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_11691'>Then said Sir Tristram: Heard ye anything of me? So God me help, said</a>

<a id='line_11695'>That me repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in</a>
<a id='line_11696'>his fellowship. So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that</a>
<a id='line_11697'>noble knights should defame him for the sake of his lady. And in this</a>
<a id='line_11698'>meanwhile La Beale Isoud made a letter unto Queen Guenever, complaining</a>
<a id='line_11699'>her of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how he had wedded the king’s</a>
<a id='line_11700'>daughter of Brittany. Queen Guenever sent her another letter, and bade</a>
<a id='line_11701'>her be of good cheer, for she should have joy after sorrow, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_11702'>Tristram was so noble a knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies</a>
<a id='line_11703'>would make such noble men to wed them. But in the end, Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_11704'>said, it shall be thus, that he shall hate her, and love you better</a>
<a id='line_11705'>than ever he did to-fore.</a>
<a id='line_11706'></a>
<a id='line_11707'>So leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_11708'>Galis, that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished all, save</a>
<a id='line_11709'>Sir Lamorak and his squire; and there he swam mightily, and fishers of</a>
<a id='line_11710'>the Isle of Servage took him up, and his squire was drowned, and the</a>
<a id='line_11711'>shipmen had great labour to save Sir Lamorak’s life, for all the</a>
<a id='line_11712'>comfort that they could do.</a>
<a id='line_11713'></a>
<a id='line_11714'>And the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great mighty</a>
<a id='line_11715'>giant. And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King Arthur’s, and</a>
<a id='line_11716'>in no wise he would do them favour. And these fishers told Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11717'>all the guise of Sir Nabon; how there came never knight of King</a>
<a id='line_11718'>Arthur’s but he destroyed him. And at the last battle that he did was</a>
<a id='line_11719'>slain Sir Nanowne le Petite, the which he put to a shameful death in</a>
<a id='line_11720'>despite of King Arthur, for he was drawn limb-meal. That forthinketh</a>
<a id='line_11721'>me, said Sir Lamorak, for that knight’s death, for he was my cousin;</a>
<a id='line_11722'>and if I were at mine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his</a>
<a id='line_11723'>death. Peace, said the fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye</a>
<a id='line_11724'>depart from hence Sir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or else</a>
<a id='line_11725'>we should die for your sake. So that I be whole, said Lamorak, of my</a>
<a id='line_11726'>disease that I have taken in the sea, I will that ye tell him that I am</a>
<a id='line_11727'>a knight of King Arthur’s, for I was never afeard to reneye my lord.</a>
<a id='line_11728'></a>
<a id='line_11729'></a>
<a id='line_11730'></a>
<a id='line_11731'>CHAPTER XXXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his wife arrived in Wales, and</a>
<a id='line_11732'>how he met there with Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_11733'></a>
<a id='line_11734'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he took a little barget,</a>
<a id='line_11735'>and his wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius her brother, to</a>
<a id='line_11736'>play them in the coasts. And when they were from the land, there was a</a>
<a id='line_11737'>wind drove them in to the coast of Wales upon this Isle of Servage,</a>
<a id='line_11738'>whereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the barget all to-rove; and there</a>
<a id='line_11739'>Dame Isoud was hurt; and as well as they might they gat into the</a>
<a id='line_11740'>forest, and there by a well he saw Segwarides and a damosel. And then</a>
<a id='line_11741'>either saluted other. Sir, said Segwarides, I know you for Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11742'>de Liones, the man in the world that I have most cause to hate, because</a>
<a id='line_11743'>ye departed the love between me and my wife; but as for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11744'>Segwarides, I will never hate a noble knight for a light lady; and</a>
<a id='line_11745'>therefore, I pray you, be my friend, and I will be yours unto my power;</a>
<a id='line_11746'>for wit ye well ye are hard bestead in this valley, and we shall have</a>
<a id='line_11747'>enough to do either of us to succour other. And then Sir Segwarides</a>
<a id='line_11748'>brought Sir Tristram to a lady thereby that was born in Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_11749'>she told him all the perils of that valley, and how there came never</a>
<a id='line_11750'>knight there but he were taken prisoner or slain. Wit you well, fair</a>
<a id='line_11751'>lady, said Sir Tristram, that I slew Sir Marhaus and delivered Cornwall</a>
<a id='line_11752'>from the truage of Ireland, and I am he that delivered the King of</a>
<a id='line_11753'>Ireland from Sir Blamore de Ganis, and I am he that beat Sir Palamides;</a>
<a id='line_11754'>and wit ye well I am Sir Tristram de Liones, that by the grace of God</a>
<a id='line_11755'>shall deliver this woful Isle of Servage. So Sir Tristram was well</a>
<a id='line_11756'>eased.</a>
<a id='line_11757'></a>
<a id='line_11758'>Then one told him there was a knight of King Arthur’s that was wrecked</a>
<a id='line_11759'>on the rocks. What is his name? said Sir Tristram. We wot not, said the</a>
<a id='line_11760'>fishers, but he keepeth it no counsel but that he is a knight of King</a>
<a id='line_11761'>Arthur’s, and by the mighty lord of this isle he setteth nought. I pray</a>
<a id='line_11762'>you, said Sir Tristram, an ye may, bring him hither that I may see him,</a>
<a id='line_11763'>and if he be any of the knights of Arthur’s I shall know him. Then the</a>
<a id='line_11764'>lady prayed the fishers to bring him to her place. So on the morrow</a>
<a id='line_11765'>they brought him thither in a fisher’s raiment; and as soon as Sir</a>
<a id='line_11766'>Tristram saw him he smiled upon him and knew him well, but he knew not</a>
<a id='line_11767'>Sir Tristram. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth by your cheer ye</a>
<a id='line_11768'>have been diseased but late, and also methinketh I should know you</a>
<a id='line_11769'>heretofore. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, that ye have seen me and met</a>
<a id='line_11770'>with me. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name. Upon a</a>
<a id='line_11771'>covenant I will tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that is, that ye will tell</a>
<a id='line_11772'>me whether ye be lord of this island or no, that is called Nabon le</a>
<a id='line_11773'>Noire. Forsooth, said Sir Tristram, I am not he, nor I hold not of him;</a>
<a id='line_11774'>I am his foe as well as ye be, and so shall I be found or I depart out</a>
<a id='line_11775'>of this isle. Well, said Sir Lamorak, since ye have said so largely</a>
<a id='line_11776'>unto me, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son unto King Pellinore.</a>
<a id='line_11777'>Forsooth, I trow well, said Sir Tristram, for an ye said other I know</a>
<a id='line_11778'>the contrary. What are ye, said Sir Lamorak, that knoweth me? I am Sir</a>
<a id='line_11779'>Tristram de Liones. Ah, sir, remember ye not of the fall ye did give me</a>
<a id='line_11780'>once, and after ye refused me to fight on foot. That was not for fear I</a>
<a id='line_11781'>had of you, said Sir Tristram, but me shamed at that time to have more</a>
<a id='line_11782'>ado with you, for meseemed ye had enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my</a>
<a id='line_11783'>kindness many ladies ye put to a reproof when ye sent the horn from</a>
<a id='line_11784'>Morgan le Fay to King Mark, whereas ye did this in despite of me. Well,</a>
<a id='line_11785'>said he, an it were to do again, so would I do, for I had liefer strife</a>
<a id='line_11786'>and debate fell in King Mark’s court rather than Arthur’s court, for</a>
<a id='line_11787'>the honour of both courts be not alike. As to that, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_11788'>I know well; but that that was done it was for despite of me, but all</a>
<a id='line_11789'>your malice, I thank God, hurt not greatly. Therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11790'>Tristram, ye shall leave all your malice, and so will I, and let us</a>
<a id='line_11791'>assay how we may win worship between you and me upon this giant Sir</a>
<a id='line_11792'>Nabon le Noire that is lord of this island, to destroy him. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_11793'>Sir Lamorak, now I understand your knighthood, it may not be false that</a>
<a id='line_11794'>all men say, for of your bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights</a>
<a id='line_11795'>ye are peerless, and for your courtesy and gentleness I showed you</a>
<a id='line_11796'>ungentleness, and that now me repenteth.</a>
<a id='line_11797'></a>
<a id='line_11798'></a>
<a id='line_11799'></a>
<a id='line_11800'>CHAPTER XXXIX. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame</a>
<a id='line_11801'>him, and made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle.</a>
<a id='line_11802'></a>
<a id='line_11803'>In the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that all</a>
<a id='line_11804'>the people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth day after.</a>
<a id='line_11805'>And the same day the son of Nabon should be made knight, and all the</a>
<a id='line_11806'>knights of that valley and thereabout should be there to joust, and all</a>
<a id='line_11807'>those of the realm of Logris should be there to joust with them of</a>
<a id='line_11808'>North Wales: and thither came five hundred knights, and they of the</a>
<a id='line_11809'>country brought thither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11810'>Kehydius, and Sir Segwarides, for they durst none otherwise do; and</a>
<a id='line_11811'>then Sir Nabon lent Sir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak’s</a>
<a id='line_11812'>desire, and Sir Lamorak jousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon</a>
<a id='line_11813'>and all the people said there was never knight that ever they saw do</a>
<a id='line_11814'>such deeds of arms; for, as the French book saith, he for-jousted all</a>
<a id='line_11815'>that were there, for the most part of five hundred knights, that none</a>
<a id='line_11816'>abode him in his saddle.</a>
<a id='line_11817'></a>
<a id='line_11818'>Then Sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play: For I saw never no</a>
<a id='line_11819'>knight do so much upon a day. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, play as I</a>
<a id='line_11820'>may, but I am weary and sore bruised. And there either gat a spear, but</a>
<a id='line_11821'>Nabon would not encounter with Sir Lamorak, but smote his horse in the</a>
<a id='line_11822'>forehead, and so slew him; and then Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and</a>
<a id='line_11823'>turned his shield and drew his sword, and there began strong battle on</a>
<a id='line_11824'>foot. But Sir Lamorak was so sore bruised and short breathed, that he</a>
<a id='line_11825'>traced and traversed somewhat aback. Fair fellow, said Sir Nabon, hold</a>
<a id='line_11826'>thy hand and I shall show thee more courtesy than ever I showed knight,</a>
<a id='line_11827'>because I have seen this day thy noble knighthood, and therefore stand</a>
<a id='line_11828'>thou by, and I will wit whether any of thy fellows will have ado with</a>
<a id='line_11829'>me. Then when Sir Tristram heard that, he stepped forth and said:</a>
<a id='line_11830'>Nabon, lend me horse and sure armour, and I will have ado with thee.</a>
<a id='line_11831'>Well, fellow, said Sir Nabon, go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm thee</a>
<a id='line_11832'>of the best thou findest there, and I shall play a marvellous play with</a>
<a id='line_11833'>thee. Then said Sir Tristram: Look ye play well, or else peradventure I</a>
<a id='line_11834'>shall learn you a new play. That is well said, fellow, said Sir Nabon.</a>
<a id='line_11835'>So when Sir Tristram was armed as him liked best, and well shielded and</a>
<a id='line_11836'>sworded, he dressed to him on foot; for well he knew that Sir Nabon</a>
<a id='line_11837'>would not abide a stroke with a spear, therefore he would slay all</a>
<a id='line_11838'>knights’ horses. Now, fair fellow, Sir Nabon, let us play. So then they</a>
<a id='line_11839'>fought long on foot, tracing and traversing, smiting and foining long</a>
<a id='line_11840'>without any rest. At the last Sir Nabon prayed him to tell him his</a>
<a id='line_11841'>name. Sir Nabon, I tell thee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a</a>
<a id='line_11842'>knight of Cornwall under King Mark. Thou art welcome, said Sir Nabon,</a>
<a id='line_11843'>for of all knights I have most desired to fight with thee or with Sir</a>
<a id='line_11844'>Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11845'></a>
<a id='line_11846'>So then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristram slew Sir Nabon,</a>
<a id='line_11847'>and so forthwith he leapt to his son, and struck off his head; and then</a>
<a id='line_11848'>all the country said they would hold of Sir Tristram. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11849'>Tristram, I will not so; here is a worshipful knight, Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_11850'>Galis, that for me he shall be lord of this country, for he hath done</a>
<a id='line_11851'>here great deeds of arms. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will not be lord of</a>
<a id='line_11852'>this country, for I have not deserved it as well as ye, therefore give</a>
<a id='line_11853'>ye it where ye will, for I will none have. Well, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_11854'>since ye nor I will not have it, let us give it to him that hath not so</a>
<a id='line_11855'>well deserved it. Do as ye list, said Segwarides, for the gift is</a>
<a id='line_11856'>yours, for I will none have an I had deserved it. So was it given to</a>
<a id='line_11857'>Segwarides, whereof he thanked them; and so was he lord, and</a>
<a id='line_11858'>worshipfully he did govern it. And then Sir Segwarides delivered all</a>
<a id='line_11859'>prisoners, and set good governance in that valley; and so he returned</a>
<a id='line_11860'>into Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale Isoud how Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_11861'>had advanced him to the Isle of Servage, and there he proclaimed in all</a>
<a id='line_11862'>Cornwall of all the adventures of these two knights, so was it openly</a>
<a id='line_11863'>known. But full woe was La Beale Isoud when she heard tell that Sir</a>
<a id='line_11864'>Tristram was wedded to Isoud la Blanche Mains.</a>
<a id='line_11865'></a>
<a id='line_11866'></a>
<a id='line_11867'></a>
<a id='line_11868'>CHAPTER XL. How Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Tristram, and how he met</a>
<a id='line_11869'>with Sir Frol, and after with Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11870'></a>
<a id='line_11871'>So turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that rode toward Arthur’s court, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_11872'>Tristram’s wife and Kehydius took a vessel and sailed into Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_11873'>unto King Howel, where he was welcome. And when he heard of these</a>
<a id='line_11874'>adventures they marvelled of his noble deeds. Now turn we unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_11875'>Lamorak, that when he was departed from Sir Tristram he rode out of the</a>
<a id='line_11876'>forest, till he came to an hermitage. When the hermit saw him, he asked</a>
<a id='line_11877'>him from whence he came. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I come from this</a>
<a id='line_11878'>valley. Sir, said the hermit: thereof I marvel. For this twenty winter</a>
<a id='line_11879'>I saw never no knight pass this country but he was either slain or</a>
<a id='line_11880'>villainously wounded, or pass as a poor prisoner. Those ill customs,</a>
<a id='line_11881'>said Sir Lamorak, are fordone, for Sir Tristram slew your lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11882'>Nabon, and his son. Then was the hermit glad, and all his brethren, for</a>
<a id='line_11883'>he said there was never such a tyrant among Christian men. And</a>
<a id='line_11884'>therefore, said the hermit, this valley and franchise we will hold of</a>
<a id='line_11885'>Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_11886'></a>
<a id='line_11887'>So on the morrow Sir Lamorak departed; and as he rode he saw four</a>
<a id='line_11888'>knights fight against one, and that one knight defended him well, but</a>
<a id='line_11889'>at the last the four knights had him down. And then Sir Lamorak went</a>
<a id='line_11890'>betwixt them, and asked them why they would slay that one knight, and</a>
<a id='line_11891'>said it was shame, four against one. Thou shalt well wit, said the four</a>
<a id='line_11892'>knights, that he is false. That is your tale, said Sir Lamorak, and</a>
<a id='line_11893'>when I hear him also speak, I will say as ye say. Then said Lamorak:</a>
<a id='line_11894'>Ah, knight, can ye not excuse you, but that ye are a false knight. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_11895'>said he, yet can I excuse me both with my word and with my hands, that</a>
<a id='line_11896'>I will make good upon one of the best of them, my body to his body.</a>
<a id='line_11897'>Then spake they all at once: We will not jeopardy our bodies as for</a>
<a id='line_11898'>thee. But wit thou well, they said, an King Arthur were here himself,</a>
<a id='line_11899'>it should not lie in his power to save his life. That is too much said,</a>
<a id='line_11900'>said Sir Lamorak, but many speak behind a man more than they will say</a>
<a id='line_11901'>to his face; and because of your words ye shall understand that I am</a>
<a id='line_11902'>one of the simplest of King Arthur’s court; in the worship of my lord</a>
<a id='line_11903'>now do your best, and in despite of you I shall rescue him. And then</a>
<a id='line_11904'>they lashed all at once to Sir Lamorak, but anon at two strokes Sir</a>
<a id='line_11905'>Lamorak had slain two of them, and then the other two fled. So then Sir</a>
<a id='line_11906'>Lamorak turned again to that knight, and asked him his name. Sir, he</a>
<a id='line_11907'>said, my name is Sir Frol of the Out Isles. Then he rode with Sir</a>
<a id='line_11908'>Lamorak and bare him company.</a>
<a id='line_11909'></a>
<a id='line_11910'>And as they rode by the way they saw a seemly knight riding against</a>
<a id='line_11911'>them, and all in white. Ah, said Frol, yonder knight jousted late with</a>
<a id='line_11912'>me and smote me down, therefore I will joust with him. Ye shall not do</a>
<a id='line_11913'>so, said Sir Lamorak, by my counsel, an ye will tell me your quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_11914'>whether ye jousted at his request, or he at yours. Nay, said Sir Frol,</a>
<a id='line_11915'>I jousted with him at my request. Sir, said Lamorak, then will I</a>
<a id='line_11916'>counsel you deal no more with him, for meseemeth by his countenance he</a>
<a id='line_11917'>should be a noble knight, and no japer; for methinketh he should be of</a>
<a id='line_11918'>the Table Round. Therefore I will not spare, said Sir Frol. And then he</a>
<a id='line_11919'>cried and said: Sir knight, make thee ready to joust. That needeth not,</a>
<a id='line_11920'>said the White Knight, for I have no lust to joust with thee; but yet</a>
<a id='line_11921'>they feutred their spears, and the White Knight overthrew Sir Frol, and</a>
<a id='line_11922'>then he rode his way a soft pace. Then Sir Lamorak rode after him, and</a>
<a id='line_11923'>prayed him to tell him his name: For meseemeth ye should be of the</a>
<a id='line_11924'>fellowship of the Round Table. Upon a covenant, said he, I will tell</a>
<a id='line_11925'>you my name, so that ye will not discover my name, and also that ye</a>
<a id='line_11926'>will tell me yours. Then, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. And</a>
<a id='line_11927'>my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then they put up their swords, and</a>
<a id='line_11928'>kissed heartily together, and either made great joy of other. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_11929'>Sir Lamorak, an it please you I will do you service. God defend, said</a>
<a id='line_11930'>Launcelot, that any of so noble a blood as ye be should do me service.</a>
<a id='line_11931'>Then he said: More, I am in a quest that I must do myself alone. Now</a>
<a id='line_11932'>God speed you, said Sir Lamorak, and so they departed. Then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11933'>came to Sir Frol and horsed him again. What knight is that? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11934'>Frol. Sir, he said, it is not for you to know, nor it is no point of my</a>
<a id='line_11935'>charge. Ye are the more uncourteous, said Sir Frol, and therefore I</a>
<a id='line_11936'>will depart from you. Ye may do as ye list, said Sir Lamorak, and yet</a>
<a id='line_11937'>by my company ye have saved the fairest flower of your garland; so they</a>
<a id='line_11938'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_11939'></a>
<a id='line_11940'></a>
<a id='line_11941'></a>
<a id='line_11942'>CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Frol, and of the courteous</a>
<a id='line_11943'>fighting with Sir Belliance his brother.</a>
<a id='line_11944'></a>
<a id='line_11945'>Then within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a well</a>
<a id='line_11946'>sleeping, and his lady sat with him and waked. Right so came Sir</a>
<a id='line_11947'>Gawaine and took the knight’s lady, and set her up behind his squire.</a>
<a id='line_11948'>So Sir Lamorak rode after Sir Gawaine, and said: Sir Gawaine, turn</a>
<a id='line_11949'>again. And then said Sir Gawaine: What will ye do with me? for I am</a>
<a id='line_11950'>nephew unto King Arthur. Sir, said he, for that cause I will spare you,</a>
<a id='line_11951'>else that lady should abide with me, or else ye should joust with me.</a>
<a id='line_11952'>Then Sir Gawaine turned him and ran to him that ought the lady, with</a>
<a id='line_11953'>his spear, but the knight with pure might smote down Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_11954'>took his lady with him. All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to himself:</a>
<a id='line_11955'>But I revenge my fellow he will say of me dishonour in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_11956'>court. Then Sir Lamorak returned and proffered that knight to joust.</a>
<a id='line_11957'>Sir, said he, I am ready. And there they came together with all their</a>
<a id='line_11958'>might, and there Sir Lamorak smote the knight through both sides that</a>
<a id='line_11959'>he fell to the earth dead.</a>
<a id='line_11960'></a>
<a id='line_11961'>Then that lady rode to that knight’s brother that hight Belliance le</a>
<a id='line_11962'>Orgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she told him how his brother</a>
<a id='line_11963'>was slain. Alas, said he, I will be revenged. And so he horsed him, and</a>
<a id='line_11964'>armed him, and within a while he overtook Sir Lamorak, and bade him:</a>
<a id='line_11965'>Turn and leave that lady, for thou and I must play a new play; for thou</a>
<a id='line_11966'>hast slain my brother Sir Frol, that was a better knight than ever wert</a>
<a id='line_11967'>thou. It might well be, said Sir Lamorak, but this day in the field I</a>
<a id='line_11968'>was found the better. So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and</a>
<a id='line_11969'>turned their shields, and drew their swords, and fought mightily as</a>
<a id='line_11970'>noble knights proved, by the space of two hours. So then Sir Belliance</a>
<a id='line_11971'>prayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11972'>de Galis. Ah, said Sir Belliance, thou art the man in the world that I</a>
<a id='line_11973'>most hate, for I slew my sons for thy sake, where I saved thy life, and</a>
<a id='line_11974'>now thou hast slain my brother Sir Frol. Alas, how should I be accorded</a>
<a id='line_11975'>with thee; therefore defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none</a>
<a id='line_11976'>other remedy. Alas, said Sir Lamorak, full well me ought to know you,</a>
<a id='line_11977'>for ye are the man that most have done for me. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_11978'>Lamorak kneeled down, and besought him of grace. Arise, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11979'>Belliance, or else thereas thou kneelest I shall slay thee. That shall</a>
<a id='line_11980'>not need, said Sir Lamorak, for I will yield me unto you, not for fear</a>
<a id='line_11981'>of you, nor for your strength, but your goodness maketh me full loath</a>
<a id='line_11982'>to have ado with you; wherefore I require you for God’s sake, and for</a>
<a id='line_11983'>the honour of knighthood, forgive me all that I have offended unto you.</a>
<a id='line_11984'>Alas, said Belliance, leave thy kneeling, or else I shall slay thee</a>
<a id='line_11985'>without mercy.</a>
<a id='line_11986'></a>
<a id='line_11987'>Then they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that all</a>
<a id='line_11988'>the ground was bloody thereas they fought. And at the last Belliance</a>
<a id='line_11989'>withdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a little hill, for he</a>
<a id='line_11990'>was so faint for bleeding that he might not stand. Then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_11991'>threw his shield upon his back, and asked him what cheer. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_11992'>Sir Belliance. Ah, Sir, yet shall I show you favour in your mal-ease.</a>
<a id='line_11993'>Ah, Knight Sir Belliance, said Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for an I</a>
<a id='line_11994'>had had thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay</a>
<a id='line_11995'>thee; but thy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs</a>
<a id='line_11996'>forgive thee mine evil will. And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and</a>
<a id='line_11997'>unlaced first his umberere, and then his own, and then either kissed</a>
<a id='line_11998'>other with weeping tears. Then Sir Lamorak led Sir Belliance to an</a>
<a id='line_11999'>abbey fast by, and there Sir Lamorak would not depart from Belliance</a>
<a id='line_12000'>till he was whole. And then they sware together that none of them</a>
<a id='line_12001'>should never fight against other. So Sir Lamorak departed and went to</a>
<a id='line_12002'>the court of King Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_12013'>CHAPTER I. How a young man came into the court of King Arthur, and how</a>
<a id='line_12014'>Sir Kay called him in scorn La Cote Male Taile.</a>
<a id='line_12015'></a>
<a id='line_12016'>At the court of King Arthur there came a young man and bigly made, and</a>
<a id='line_12017'>he was richly beseen: and he desired to be made knight of the king, but</a>
<a id='line_12018'>his over-garment sat over-thwartly, howbeit it was rich cloth of gold.</a>
<a id='line_12019'>What is your name? said King Arthur. Sir, said he, my name is Breunor</a>
<a id='line_12020'>le Noire, and within short space ye shall know that I am of good kin.</a>
<a id='line_12021'>It may well be, said Sir Kay, the Seneschal, but in mockage ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_12022'>called La Cote Male Taile, that is as much to say, the evil-shapen</a>
<a id='line_12023'>coat. It is a great thing that thou askest, said the king; and for what</a>
<a id='line_12024'>cause wearest thou that rich coat? tell me, for I can well think for</a>
<a id='line_12025'>some cause it is. Sir, he answered, I had a father, a noble knight, and</a>
<a id='line_12026'>as he rode a-hunting, upon a day it happed him to lay him down to</a>
<a id='line_12027'>sleep; and there came a knight that had been long his enemy, and when</a>
<a id='line_12028'>he saw he was fast asleep he all to-hew him; and this same coat had my</a>
<a id='line_12029'>father on the same time; and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon</a>
<a id='line_12030'>me, for the strokes be on it as I found it, and never shall be amended</a>
<a id='line_12031'>for me. Thus to have my father’s death in remembrance I wear this coat</a>
<a id='line_12032'>till I be revenged; and because ye are called the most noblest king of</a>
<a id='line_12033'>the world I come to you that ye should make me knight. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12034'>Lamorak and Sir Gaheris, it were well done to make him knight; for him</a>
<a id='line_12035'>beseemeth well of person and of countenance, that he shall prove a good</a>
<a id='line_12036'>man, and a good knight, and a mighty; for, Sir, an ye be remembered,</a>
<a id='line_12037'>even such one was Sir Launcelot du Lake when he came first into this</a>
<a id='line_12038'>court, and full few of us knew from whence he came; and now is he</a>
<a id='line_12039'>proved the man of most worship in the world; and all your court and all</a>
<a id='line_12040'>your Round Table is by Sir Launcelot worshipped and amended more than</a>
<a id='line_12041'>by any knight now living. That is truth, said the king, and to-morrow</a>
<a id='line_12042'>at your request I shall make him knight.</a>
<a id='line_12043'></a>
<a id='line_12044'>So on the morrow there was an hart found, and thither rode King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_12045'>with a company of his knights to slay the hart. And this young man that</a>
<a id='line_12046'>Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile was there left behind with Queen</a>
<a id='line_12047'>Guenever; and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a</a>
<a id='line_12048'>strong tower of stone, and it happened that he at that time brake</a>
<a id='line_12049'>loose, and came hurling afore the queen and her knights. And when the</a>
<a id='line_12050'>queen saw the lion she cried and fled, and prayed her knights to rescue</a>
<a id='line_12051'>her. And there was none of them all but twelve that abode, and all the</a>
<a id='line_12052'>other fled. Then said La Cote Male Taile: Now I see well that all</a>
<a id='line_12053'>coward knights be not dead; and therewithal he drew his sword and</a>
<a id='line_12054'>dressed him afore the lion. And that lion gaped wide and came upon him</a>
<a id='line_12055'>ramping to have slain him. And he then smote him in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_12056'>head such a mighty stroke that it clave his head in sunder, and dashed</a>
<a id='line_12057'>to the earth. Then was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_12058'>named by scorn La Cote Male Taile had slain the lion. With that the</a>
<a id='line_12059'>king came home. And when the queen told him of that adventure, he was</a>
<a id='line_12060'>well pleased, and said: Upon pain of mine head he shall prove a noble</a>
<a id='line_12061'>man and a faithful knight, and true of his promise: then the king</a>
<a id='line_12062'>forthwithal made him knight. Now Sir, said this young knight, I require</a>
<a id='line_12063'>you and all the knights of your court, that ye call me by none other</a>
<a id='line_12064'>name but La Cote Male Taile: in so much as Sir Kay hath so named me so</a>
<a id='line_12065'>will I be called. I assent me well thereto, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_12066'></a>
<a id='line_12067'></a>
<a id='line_12068'></a>
<a id='line_12069'>CHAPTER II. How a damosel came into the court and desired a knight to</a>
<a id='line_12070'>take on him an enquest, which La Cote Male Taile emprised.</a>
<a id='line_12071'></a>
<a id='line_12072'>Then that same day there came a damosel into the court, and she brought</a>
<a id='line_12073'>with her a great black shield, with a white hand in the midst holding a</a>
<a id='line_12074'>sword. Other picture was there none in that shield. When King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_12075'>saw her he asked her from whence she came and what she would. Sir, she</a>
<a id='line_12076'>said, I have ridden long and many a day with this shield many ways, and</a>
<a id='line_12077'>for this cause I am come to your court: there was a good knight that</a>
<a id='line_12078'>ought this shield, and this knight had undertaken a great deed of arms</a>
<a id='line_12079'>to enchieve it; and so it misfortuned him another strong knight met</a>
<a id='line_12080'>with him by sudden adventure, and there they fought long, and either</a>
<a id='line_12081'>wounded other passing sore; and they were so weary that they left that</a>
<a id='line_12082'>battle even hand. So this knight that ought this shield saw none other</a>
<a id='line_12083'>way but he must die; and then he commanded me to bear this shield to</a>
<a id='line_12084'>the court of King Arthur, he requiring and praying some good knight to</a>
<a id='line_12085'>take this shield, and that he would fulfil the quest that he was in.</a>
<a id='line_12086'>Now what say ye to this quest? said King Arthur; is there any of you</a>
<a id='line_12087'>here that will take upon him to wield this shield? Then was there not</a>
<a id='line_12088'>one that would speak one word. Then Sir Kay took the shield in his</a>
<a id='line_12089'>hands. Sir knight, said the damosel, what is your name? Wit ye well,</a>
<a id='line_12090'>said he, my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal, that wide-where is known.</a>
<a id='line_12091'>Sir, said that damosel, lay down that shield, for wit ye well it</a>
<a id='line_12092'>falleth not for you, for he must be a better knight than ye that shall</a>
<a id='line_12093'>wield this shield. Damosel, said Sir Kay, wit ye well I took this</a>
<a id='line_12094'>shield in my hands by your leave for to behold it, not to that intent;</a>
<a id='line_12095'>but go wheresomever thou wilt, for I will not go with you.</a>
<a id='line_12096'></a>
<a id='line_12097'>Then the damosel stood still a great while and beheld many of those</a>
<a id='line_12098'>knights. Then spake the knight, La Cote Male Taile: Fair damosel, I</a>
<a id='line_12099'>will take the shield and that adventure upon me, so I wist I should</a>
<a id='line_12100'>know whitherward my journey might be; for because I was this day made</a>
<a id='line_12101'>knight I would take this adventure upon me. What is your name, fair</a>
<a id='line_12102'>young man? said the damosel. My name is, said he, La Cote Male Taile.</a>
<a id='line_12103'>Well mayest thou be called so, said the damosel, the knight with the</a>
<a id='line_12104'>evil-shapen coat; but an thou be so hardy to take upon thee to bear</a>
<a id='line_12105'>that shield and to follow me, wit thou well thy skin shall be as well</a>
<a id='line_12106'>hewn as thy coat. As for that, said La Cote Male Taile, when I am so</a>
<a id='line_12107'>hewn I will ask you no salve to heal me withal. And forthwithal there</a>
<a id='line_12108'>came into the court two squires and brought him great horses, and his</a>
<a id='line_12109'>armour, and his spears, and anon he was armed and took his leave. I</a>
<a id='line_12110'>would not by my will, said the king, that ye took upon you that hard</a>
<a id='line_12111'>adventure. Sir, said he, this adventure is mine, and the first that</a>
<a id='line_12112'>ever I took upon me, and that will I follow whatsomever come of me.</a>
<a id='line_12113'>Then that damosel departed, and La Cote Male Taile fast followed after.</a>
<a id='line_12114'>And within a while he overtook the damosel, and anon she missaid him in</a>
<a id='line_12115'>the foulest manner.</a>
<a id='line_12116'></a>
<a id='line_12117'></a>
<a id='line_12118'></a>
<a id='line_12119'>CHAPTER III. How La Cote Male Taile overthrew Sir Dagonet the king’s</a>
<a id='line_12120'>fool, and of the rebuke that he had of the damosel.</a>
<a id='line_12121'></a>
<a id='line_12122'>Then Sir Kay ordained Sir Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, to follow after</a>
<a id='line_12123'>La Cote Male Taile; and there Sir Kay ordained that Sir Dagonet was</a>
<a id='line_12124'>horsed and armed, and bade him follow La Cote Male Taile and proffer</a>
<a id='line_12125'>him to joust, and so he did; and when he saw La Cote Male Taile, he</a>
<a id='line_12126'>cried and bade him make him ready to joust. So Sir La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12127'>smote Sir Dagonet over his horse’s croup. Then the damosel mocked La</a>
<a id='line_12128'>Cote Male Taile, and said: Fie for shame! now art thou shamed in</a>
<a id='line_12129'>Arthur’s court, when they send a fool to have ado with thee, and</a>
<a id='line_12130'>specially at thy first jousts; thus she rode long, and chid. And within</a>
<a id='line_12131'>a while there came Sir Bleoberis, the good knight, and there he jousted</a>
<a id='line_12132'>with La Cote Male Taile, and there Sir Bleoberis smote him so sore,</a>
<a id='line_12133'>that horse and all fell to the earth. Then La Cote Male Taile arose up</a>
<a id='line_12134'>lightly, and dressed his shield, and drew his sword, and would have</a>
<a id='line_12135'>done battle to the utterance, for he was wood wroth. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12136'>Bleoberis de Ganis, as at this time I will not fight upon foot. Then</a>
<a id='line_12137'>the damosel Maledisant rebuked him in the foulest manner, and bade him:</a>
<a id='line_12138'>Turn again, coward. Ah, damosel, he said, I pray you of mercy to missay</a>
<a id='line_12139'>me no more, my grief is enough though ye give me no more; I call myself</a>
<a id='line_12140'>never the worse knight when a mare’s son faileth me, and also I count</a>
<a id='line_12141'>me never the worse knight for a fall of Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_12142'></a>
<a id='line_12143'>So thus he rode with her two days; and by fortune there came Sir</a>
<a id='line_12144'>Palomides and encountered with him, and he in the same wise served him</a>
<a id='line_12145'>as did Bleoberis to-forehand. What dost thou here in my fellowship?</a>
<a id='line_12146'>said the damosel Maledisant, thou canst not sit no knight, nor</a>
<a id='line_12147'>withstand him one buffet, but if it were Sir Dagonet. Ah, fair damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12148'>I am not the worse to take a fall of Sir Palomides, and yet great</a>
<a id='line_12149'>disworship have I none, for neither Bleoberis nor yet Palomides would</a>
<a id='line_12150'>not fight with me on foot. As for that, said the damosel, wit thou well</a>
<a id='line_12151'>they have disdain and scorn to light off their horses to fight with</a>
<a id='line_12152'>such a lewd knight as thou art. So in the meanwhile there came Sir</a>
<a id='line_12153'>Mordred, Sir Gawaine’s brother, and so he fell in the fellowship with</a>
<a id='line_12154'>the damosel Maledisant. And then they came afore the Castle Orgulous,</a>
<a id='line_12155'>and there was such a custom that there might no knight come by that</a>
<a id='line_12156'>castle but either he must joust or be prisoner, or at the least to lose</a>
<a id='line_12157'>his horse and his harness. And there came out two knights against them,</a>
<a id='line_12158'>and Sir Mordred jousted with the foremost, and that knight of the</a>
<a id='line_12159'>castle smote Sir Mordred down off his horse. And then La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12160'>Taile jousted with that other, and either of them smote other down,</a>
<a id='line_12161'>horse and all, to the earth. And when they avoided their horses, then</a>
<a id='line_12162'>either of them took other’s horses. And then La Cote Male Taile rode</a>
<a id='line_12163'>unto that knight that smote down Sir Mordred, and jousted with him. And</a>
<a id='line_12164'>there Sir La Cote Male Taile hurt and wounded him passing sore, and put</a>
<a id='line_12165'>him from his horse as he had been dead. So he turned unto him that met</a>
<a id='line_12166'>him afore, and he took the flight towards the castle, and Sir La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12167'>Male Taile rode after him into the Castle Orgulous, and there La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12168'>Male Taile slew him.</a>
<a id='line_12169'></a>
<a id='line_12170'></a>
<a id='line_12171'></a>
<a id='line_12172'>CHAPTER IV. How La Cote Male Taile fought against an hundred knights,</a>
<a id='line_12173'>and how he escaped by the mean of a lady.</a>
<a id='line_12174'></a>
<a id='line_12175'>And anon there came an hundred knights about him and assailed him; and</a>
<a id='line_12176'>when he saw his horse should be slain he alighted and voided his horse,</a>
<a id='line_12177'>and put the bridle under his feet, and so put him out of the gate. And</a>
<a id='line_12178'>when he had so done he hurled in among them, and dressed his back unto</a>
<a id='line_12179'>a lady’s chamber-wall, thinking himself that he had liefer die there</a>
<a id='line_12180'>with worship than to abide the rebukes of the damosel Maledisant. And</a>
<a id='line_12181'>in the meantime as he stood and fought, that lady whose was the chamber</a>
<a id='line_12182'>went out slily at her postern, and without the gates she found La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12183'>Male Taile’s horse, and lightly she gat him by the bridle, and tied him</a>
<a id='line_12184'>to the postern. And then she went unto her chamber slily again for to</a>
<a id='line_12185'>behold how that one knight fought against an hundred knights. And when</a>
<a id='line_12186'>she had beheld him long she went to a window behind his back, and said:</a>
<a id='line_12187'>Thou knight, thou fightest wonderly well, but for all that at the last</a>
<a id='line_12188'>thou must needs die, but, an thou canst through thy mighty prowess, win</a>
<a id='line_12189'>unto yonder postern, for there have I fastened thy horse to abide thee:</a>
<a id='line_12190'>but wit thou well thou must think on thy worship, and think not to die,</a>
<a id='line_12191'>for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and</a>
<a id='line_12192'>mightily. When La Cote Male Taile heard her say so he gripped his sword</a>
<a id='line_12193'>in his hands, and put his shield fair afore him, and through the</a>
<a id='line_12194'>thickest press he thrulled through them. And when he came to the</a>
<a id='line_12195'>postern he found there ready four knights, and at two the first strokes</a>
<a id='line_12196'>he slew two of the knights, and the other fled; and so he won his horse</a>
<a id='line_12197'>and rode from them. And all as it was it was rehearsed in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_12198'>court, how he slew twelve knights within the Castle Orgulous; and so he</a>
<a id='line_12199'>rode on his way.</a>
<a id='line_12200'></a>
<a id='line_12201'>And in the meanwhile the damosel said to Sir Mordred: I ween my foolish</a>
<a id='line_12202'>knight be either slain or taken prisoner: then were they ware where he</a>
<a id='line_12203'>came riding. And when he was come unto them he told all how he had sped</a>
<a id='line_12204'>and escaped in despite of them all: And some of the best of them will</a>
<a id='line_12205'>tell no tales. Thou liest falsely, said the damosel, that dare I make</a>
<a id='line_12206'>good, but as a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee</a>
<a id='line_12207'>pass. That may ye prove, said La Cote Male Taile. With that she sent a</a>
<a id='line_12208'>courier of hers, that rode alway with her, for to know the truth of</a>
<a id='line_12209'>this deed; and so he rode thither lightly, and asked how and in what</a>
<a id='line_12210'>manner that La Cote Male Taile was escaped out of the castle. Then all</a>
<a id='line_12211'>the knights cursed him, and said that he was a fiend and no man: For he</a>
<a id='line_12212'>hath slain here twelve of our best knights, and we weened unto this day</a>
<a id='line_12213'>that it had been too much for Sir Launcelot du Lake or for Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12214'>de Liones. And in despite of us all he is departed from us and maugre</a>
<a id='line_12215'>our heads.</a>
<a id='line_12216'></a>
<a id='line_12217'>With this answer the courier departed and came to Maledisant his lady,</a>
<a id='line_12218'>and told her all how Sir La Cote Male Taile had sped at the Castle</a>
<a id='line_12219'>Orgulous. Then she smote down her head, and said little. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_12220'>said Sir Mordred to the damosel, ye are greatly to blame so to rebuke</a>
<a id='line_12221'>him, for I warn you plainly he is a good knight, and I doubt not but he</a>
<a id='line_12222'>shall prove a noble knight; but as yet he may not yet sit sure on</a>
<a id='line_12223'>horseback, for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage</a>
<a id='line_12224'>and exercise. But when he cometh to the strokes of his sword he is then</a>
<a id='line_12225'>noble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides, for wit</a>
<a id='line_12226'>ye well they are wily men of arms, and anon they know when they see a</a>
<a id='line_12227'>young knight by his riding, how they are sure to give him a fall from</a>
<a id='line_12228'>his horse or a great buffet. But for the most part they will not light</a>
<a id='line_12229'>on foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed. For</a>
<a id='line_12230'>in likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he was first made knight, he</a>
<a id='line_12231'>was often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he</a>
<a id='line_12232'>recovered his renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round</a>
<a id='line_12233'>Table. And therefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many</a>
<a id='line_12234'>knights causeth them that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have</a>
<a id='line_12235'>seen the old proved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but</a>
<a id='line_12236'>young beginners. Thus they rode sure talking by the way together.</a>
<a id='line_12237'></a>
<a id='line_12238'>Here leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12239'>du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_12240'></a>
<a id='line_12241'></a>
<a id='line_12242'></a>
<a id='line_12243'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12244'>Male Taile, and how he followed after him, and how La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12245'>was prisoner.</a>
<a id='line_12246'></a>
<a id='line_12247'>That when he was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard he tell</a>
<a id='line_12248'>of the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he slew the lion, and how</a>
<a id='line_12249'>he took upon him the adventure of the black shield, the which was named</a>
<a id='line_12250'>at that time the hardiest adventure of the world. So God me save, said</a>
<a id='line_12251'>Sir Launcelot unto many of his fellows, it was shame to all the noble</a>
<a id='line_12252'>knights to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure upon him</a>
<a id='line_12253'>for his destruction; for I will that ye wit, said Sir Launcelot, that</a>
<a id='line_12254'>that damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield many a day for to seek</a>
<a id='line_12255'>the most proved knights, and that was she that Breuse Saunce Pité took</a>
<a id='line_12256'>that shield from her, and after Tristram de Liones rescued that shield</a>
<a id='line_12257'>from him and gave it to the damosel again, a little afore that time</a>
<a id='line_12258'>that Sir Tristram fought with my nephew Sir Blamore de Ganis, for a</a>
<a id='line_12259'>quarrel that was betwixt the King of Ireland and him. Then many knights</a>
<a id='line_12260'>were sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone forth to that</a>
<a id='line_12261'>adventure. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I cast me to ride after him. And</a>
<a id='line_12262'>within seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male Taile, and then</a>
<a id='line_12263'>he saluted him and the damosel Maledisant. And when Sir Mordred saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_12264'>Launcelot, then he left their fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_12265'>with them all a day, and ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile;</a>
<a id='line_12266'>and then Sir Launcelot answered for him, then she left off, and rebuked</a>
<a id='line_12267'>Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_12268'></a>
<a id='line_12269'>So this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12270'>Launcelot, excusing him of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains; and</a>
<a id='line_12271'>said in the letter, as he was a true knight he had never ado fleshly</a>
<a id='line_12272'>with Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and gentily Sir</a>
<a id='line_12273'>Tristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching him to be his good</a>
<a id='line_12274'>friend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall, and that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12275'>would excuse him if that ever he saw her. And within short time by the</a>
<a id='line_12276'>grace of God, said Sir Tristram, that he would speak with La Beale</a>
<a id='line_12277'>Isoud, and with him right hastily. Then Sir Launcelot departed from the</a>
<a id='line_12278'>damosel and from Sir La Cote Male Taile, for to oversee that letter,</a>
<a id='line_12279'>and to write another letter unto Sir Tristram de Liones.</a>
<a id='line_12280'></a>
<a id='line_12281'>And in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel until</a>
<a id='line_12282'>they came to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were six knights</a>
<a id='line_12283'>stood afore him, and one of them proffered to joust with La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12284'>Taile. And there La Cote Male Taile smote him over his horse’s croup.</a>
<a id='line_12285'>And then the five knights set upon him all at once with their spears,</a>
<a id='line_12286'>and there they smote La Cote Male Taile down, horse and man. And then</a>
<a id='line_12287'>they alighted suddenly, and set their hands upon him all at once, and</a>
<a id='line_12288'>took him prisoner, and so led him unto the castle and kept him as</a>
<a id='line_12289'>prisoner.</a>
<a id='line_12290'></a>
<a id='line_12291'>And on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered the damosel with</a>
<a id='line_12292'>letters unto Sir Tristram, and then he took his way after La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12293'>Taile; and by the way upon a bridge there was a knight proffered Sir</a>
<a id='line_12294'>Launcelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot smote him down, and then they</a>
<a id='line_12295'>fought upon foot a noble battle together, and a mighty; and at the last</a>
<a id='line_12296'>Sir Launcelot smote him down grovelling upon his hands and his knees.</a>
<a id='line_12297'>And then that knight yielded him, and Sir Launcelot received him fair.</a>
<a id='line_12298'>Sir, said the knight, I require thee tell me your name, for much my</a>
<a id='line_12299'>heart giveth unto you. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, as at this time I will</a>
<a id='line_12300'>not tell you my name, unless then that ye tell me your name. Certainly,</a>
<a id='line_12301'>said the knight, my name is Sir Nerovens, that was made knight of my</a>
<a id='line_12302'>lord Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, Nerovens de Lile, said Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_12303'>am right glad that ye are proved a good knight, for now wit ye well my</a>
<a id='line_12304'>name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Nerovens de Lile, what</a>
<a id='line_12305'>have I done! And therewithal flatling he fell to his feet, and would</a>
<a id='line_12306'>have kissed them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him; and then either</a>
<a id='line_12307'>made great joy of other. And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot that</a>
<a id='line_12308'>he should not go by the Castle of Pendragon: For there is a lord, a</a>
<a id='line_12309'>mighty knight, and many knights with him, and this night I heard say</a>
<a id='line_12310'>that they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12311'>and they say he is a Knight of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_12312'></a>
<a id='line_12313'></a>
<a id='line_12314'></a>
<a id='line_12315'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after with</a>
<a id='line_12316'>Sir Brian, and how he delivered the prisoners.</a>
<a id='line_12317'></a>
<a id='line_12318'>Ah, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and him shall I</a>
<a id='line_12319'>rescue or else I shall lose my life therefore. And therewithal he rode</a>
<a id='line_12320'>fast till he came before the Castle of Pendragon; and anon therewithal</a>
<a id='line_12321'>there came six knights, and all made them ready to set upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_12322'>Launcelot at once; then Sir Launcelot feutred his spear, and smote the</a>
<a id='line_12323'>foremost that he brake his back in-sunder, and three of them hit and</a>
<a id='line_12324'>three failed. And then Sir Launcelot passed through them, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_12325'>he turned in again, and smote another knight through the breast and</a>
<a id='line_12326'>throughout the back more than an ell, and therewithal his spear brake.</a>
<a id='line_12327'>So then all the remnant of the four knights drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_12328'>lashed at Sir Launcelot. And at every stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so</a>
<a id='line_12329'>his strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided their saddles,</a>
<a id='line_12330'>passing sore wounded; and forthwithal he rode hurling into that castle.</a>
<a id='line_12331'></a>
<a id='line_12332'>And anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir Brian de</a>
<a id='line_12333'>les Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy unto King</a>
<a id='line_12334'>Arthur, within a while he was armed and upon horseback. And then they</a>
<a id='line_12335'>feutred their spears and hurled together so strongly that both their</a>
<a id='line_12336'>horses rashed to the earth. And then they avoided their saddles, and</a>
<a id='line_12337'>dressed their shields, and drew their swords, and flang together as</a>
<a id='line_12338'>wood men, and there were many strokes given in a while. At the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_12339'>Launcelot gave to Sir Brian such a buffet that he kneeled upon his</a>
<a id='line_12340'>knees, and then Sir Launcelot rashed upon him, and with great force he</a>
<a id='line_12341'>pulled off his helm; and when Sir Brian saw that he should be slain he</a>
<a id='line_12342'>yielded him, and put him in his mercy and in his grace. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_12343'>Launcelot made him to deliver all his prisoners that he had within his</a>
<a id='line_12344'>castle, and therein Sir Launcelot found of Arthur’s knights thirty, and</a>
<a id='line_12345'>forty ladies, and so he delivered them; and then he rode his way. And</a>
<a id='line_12346'>anon as La Cote Male Taile was delivered he gat his horse, and his</a>
<a id='line_12347'>harness, and his damosel Maledisant.</a>
<a id='line_12348'></a>
<a id='line_12349'>The meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten withal</a>
<a id='line_12350'>afore at the bridge, he sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot to wit how</a>
<a id='line_12351'>he sped at the Castle of Pendragon. And then they within the castle</a>
<a id='line_12352'>marvelled what knight he was, when Sir Brian and his knights delivered</a>
<a id='line_12353'>all those prisoners. Have ye no marvel, said the damosel, for the best</a>
<a id='line_12354'>knight in this world was here, and did this journey, and wit ye well,</a>
<a id='line_12355'>she said, it was Sir Launcelot. Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so</a>
<a id='line_12356'>was his lady, and all his knights, that such a man should win them. And</a>
<a id='line_12357'>when the damosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_12358'>Launcelot du Lake that had ridden with them in fellowship, and that she</a>
<a id='line_12359'>remembered her how she had rebuked him and called him coward, then was</a>
<a id='line_12360'>she passing heavy.</a>
<a id='line_12361'></a>
<a id='line_12362'></a>
<a id='line_12363'></a>
<a id='line_12364'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Male disant,</a>
<a id='line_12365'>and named her the Damosel Bienpensant.</a>
<a id='line_12366'></a>
<a id='line_12367'>So then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir</a>
<a id='line_12368'>Launcelot. And within two mile they overtook him, and saluted him, and</a>
<a id='line_12369'>thanked him, and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy of her evil deed</a>
<a id='line_12370'>and saying: For now I know the flower of all knighthood is departed</a>
<a id='line_12371'>even between Sir Tristram and you. For God knoweth, said the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12372'>that I have sought you my lord, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long,</a>
<a id='line_12373'>and now I thank God I have met with you; and once at Camelot I met with</a>
<a id='line_12374'>Sir Tristram, and there he rescued this black shield with the white</a>
<a id='line_12375'>hand holding a naked sword that Sir Breuse Saunce Pité had taken from</a>
<a id='line_12376'>me. Now, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my name? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_12377'>said she, there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought withal at</a>
<a id='line_12378'>the bridge, and she told me your name was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Blame</a>
<a id='line_12379'>have she then, said Sir Launcelot, but her lord, Sir Nerovens, hath</a>
<a id='line_12380'>told her. But, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, upon this covenant I will</a>
<a id='line_12381'>ride with you, so that ye will not rebuke this knight Sir La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12382'>Taile no more; for he is a good knight, and I doubt not he shall prove</a>
<a id='line_12383'>a noble knight, and for his sake and pity that he should not be</a>
<a id='line_12384'>destroyed I followed him to succour him in this great need. Ah, Jesu</a>
<a id='line_12385'>thank you, said the damosel, for now I will say unto you and to him</a>
<a id='line_12386'>both, I rebuked him never for no hate that I hated him, but for great</a>
<a id='line_12387'>love that I had to him. For ever I supposed that he had been too young</a>
<a id='line_12388'>and too tender to take upon him these adventures. And therefore by my</a>
<a id='line_12389'>will I would have driven him away for jealousy that I had of his life,</a>
<a id='line_12390'>for it may be no young knight’s deed that shall enchieve this adventure</a>
<a id='line_12391'>to the end. Pardieu, said Sir Launcelot, it is well said, and where ye</a>
<a id='line_12392'>are called the Damosel Maledisant I will call you the Damosel</a>
<a id='line_12393'>Bienpensant.</a>
<a id='line_12394'></a>
<a id='line_12395'>And so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of</a>
<a id='line_12396'>the country of Surluse, and there they found a fair village with a</a>
<a id='line_12397'>strong bridge like a fortress. And when Sir Launcelot and they were at</a>
<a id='line_12398'>the bridge there stert forth afore them of gentlemen and yeomen many,</a>
<a id='line_12399'>that said: Fair lords, ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress</a>
<a id='line_12400'>because of that black shield that I see one of you bear, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_12401'>there shall not pass but one of you at once; therefore choose you which</a>
<a id='line_12402'>of you shall enter within this bridge first. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12403'>proffered himself first to enter within this bridge. Sir, said La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12404'>Male Taile, I beseech you let me enter within this fortress, and if I</a>
<a id='line_12405'>may speed well I will send for you, and if it happened that I be slain,</a>
<a id='line_12406'>there it goeth. And if so be that I am a prisoner taken, then may ye</a>
<a id='line_12407'>rescue me. I am loath, said Sir Launcelot, to let you pass this</a>
<a id='line_12408'>passage. Sir, said La Cote Male Taile, I pray you let me put my body in</a>
<a id='line_12409'>this adventure. Now go your way, said Sir Launcelot, and Jesu be your</a>
<a id='line_12410'>speed.</a>
<a id='line_12411'></a>
<a id='line_12412'>So he entered, and anon there met with him two brethren, the one hight</a>
<a id='line_12413'>Sir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de Amours. And anon</a>
<a id='line_12414'>they met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12415'>smote down Plaine de Force, and after he smote down Plaine de Amours;</a>
<a id='line_12416'>and then they dressed them to their shields and swords, and bade La</a>
<a id='line_12417'>Cote Male Taile alight, and so he did; and there was dashing and</a>
<a id='line_12418'>foining with swords, and so they began to assail full hard La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12419'>Taile, and many great wounds they gave him upon his head, and upon his</a>
<a id='line_12420'>breast, and upon his shoulders. And as he might ever among he gave sad</a>
<a id='line_12421'>strokes again. And then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be</a>
<a id='line_12422'>of both hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he by fine force and</a>
<a id='line_12423'>knightly prowess gat them afore him. And then when he felt himself so</a>
<a id='line_12424'>wounded, then he doubled his strokes, and gave them so many wounds that</a>
<a id='line_12425'>he felled them to the earth, and would have slain them had they not</a>
<a id='line_12426'>yielded them. And right so Sir La Cote Male Taile took the best horse</a>
<a id='line_12427'>that there was of them three, and so rode forth his way to the other</a>
<a id='line_12428'>fortress and bridge; and there he met with the third brother whose name</a>
<a id='line_12429'>was Sir Plenorius, a full noble knight, and there they jousted</a>
<a id='line_12430'>together, and either smote other down, horse and man, to the earth. And</a>
<a id='line_12431'>then they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew</a>
<a id='line_12432'>their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight</a>
<a id='line_12433'>was afore on the bridge, and another while the other. And thus they</a>
<a id='line_12434'>fought two hours and more, and never rested. And ever Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_12435'>the damosel beheld them. Alas, said the damosel, my knight fighteth</a>
<a id='line_12436'>passing sore and over long. Now may ye see, said Sir Launcelot, that he</a>
<a id='line_12437'>is a noble knight, for to consider his first battle, and his grievous</a>
<a id='line_12438'>wounds; and even forthwithal so wounded as he is, it is marvel that he</a>
<a id='line_12439'>may endure this long battle with that good knight.</a>
<a id='line_12440'></a>
<a id='line_12441'></a>
<a id='line_12442'></a>
<a id='line_12443'>CHAPTER VIII. How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after</a>
<a id='line_12444'>rescued by Sir Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame four brethren.</a>
<a id='line_12445'></a>
<a id='line_12446'>This meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the earth,</a>
<a id='line_12447'>what for-wounded and what for-bled he might not stand. Then the other</a>
<a id='line_12448'>knight had pity of him, and said: Fair young knight, dismay you not,</a>
<a id='line_12449'>for had ye been fresh when ye met with me, as I was, I wot well that I</a>
<a id='line_12450'>should not have endured so long as ye have done; and therefore for your</a>
<a id='line_12451'>noble deeds of arms I shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all</a>
<a id='line_12452'>that I may. And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him</a>
<a id='line_12453'>up in his arms, and led him into his tower. And then he commanded him</a>
<a id='line_12454'>the wine, and made to search him and to stop his bleeding wounds. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_12455'>said La Cote Male Taile, withdraw you from me, and hie you to yonder</a>
<a id='line_12456'>bridge again, for there will meet with you another manner knight than</a>
<a id='line_12457'>ever was I. Why, said Plenorius, is there another manner knight behind</a>
<a id='line_12458'>of your fellowship? Yea, said La Cote Male Taile, there is a much</a>
<a id='line_12459'>better knight than I am. What is his name? said Plenorius. Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_12460'>know for me, said La Cote Male Taile. Well, said the knight, he shall</a>
<a id='line_12461'>be encountered withal whatsomever he be.</a>
<a id='line_12462'></a>
<a id='line_12463'>Then Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said: Sir Plenorius, where</a>
<a id='line_12464'>art thou? either thou must deliver me the prisoner that thou hast led</a>
<a id='line_12465'>unto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me. Then Plenorius gat</a>
<a id='line_12466'>his horse, and came with a spear in his hand walloping toward Sir</a>
<a id='line_12467'>Launcelot; and then they began to feutre their spears, and came</a>
<a id='line_12468'>together as thunder, and smote either other so mightily that their</a>
<a id='line_12469'>horses fell down under them. And then they avoided their horses, and</a>
<a id='line_12470'>pulled out their swords, and like two bulls they lashed together with</a>
<a id='line_12471'>great strokes and foins; but ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon</a>
<a id='line_12472'>him, and Sir Plenorius traced to have gone about him. But Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12473'>would not suffer that, but bare him backer and backer, till he came</a>
<a id='line_12474'>nigh his tower gate. And then said Sir Launcelot: I know thee well for</a>
<a id='line_12475'>a good knight, but wit thou well thy life and death is in my hand, and</a>
<a id='line_12476'>therefore yield thee to me, and thy prisoner. The other answered no</a>
<a id='line_12477'>word, but struck mightily upon Sir Launcelot’s helm, that the fire</a>
<a id='line_12478'>sprang out of his eyes. Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes so</a>
<a id='line_12479'>thick, and smote at him so mightily, that he made him kneel upon his</a>
<a id='line_12480'>knees. And therewith Sir Launcelot leapt upon him, and pulled him</a>
<a id='line_12481'>grovelling down. Then Sir Plenorius yielded him, and his tower, and all</a>
<a id='line_12482'>his prisoners at his will.</a>
<a id='line_12483'></a>
<a id='line_12484'>Then Sir Launcelot received him and took his troth; and then he rode to</a>
<a id='line_12485'>the other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted with other three of</a>
<a id='line_12486'>his brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the other hight Pellogris,</a>
<a id='line_12487'>and the third Sir Pellandris. And first upon horseback Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12488'>smote them down, and afterward he beat them on foot, and made them to</a>
<a id='line_12489'>yield them unto him; and then he returned unto Sir Plenorius, and there</a>
<a id='line_12490'>he found in his prison King Carados of Scotland, and many other</a>
<a id='line_12491'>knights, and all they were delivered. And then Sir La Cote Male Taile</a>
<a id='line_12492'>came to Sir Launcelot, and then Sir Launcelot would have given him all</a>
<a id='line_12493'>these fortresses and these bridges. Nay, said La Cote Male Taile, I</a>
<a id='line_12494'>will not have Sir Plenorius’ livelihood; with that he will grant you,</a>
<a id='line_12495'>my lord Sir Launcelot, to come unto King Arthur’s court, and to be his</a>
<a id='line_12496'>knight, and all his brethren, I will pray you, my lord, to let him have</a>
<a id='line_12497'>his livelihood. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, with this that he will</a>
<a id='line_12498'>come to the court of King Arthur and become his man, and his brethren</a>
<a id='line_12499'>five. And as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12500'>Launcelot, at the next feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_12501'>be Knight of the Round Table. Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of</a>
<a id='line_12502'>Pentecost I will be at Arthur’s court, and at that time I will be</a>
<a id='line_12503'>guided and ruled as King Arthur and ye will have me. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12504'>and Sir La Cote Male Taile reposed them there, unto the time that Sir</a>
<a id='line_12505'>La Cote Male Taile was whole of his wounds, and there they had merry</a>
<a id='line_12506'>cheer, and good rest, and many good games, and there were many fair</a>
<a id='line_12507'>ladies.</a>

<a id='line_12511'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot made La Cote Male Taile lord of the</a>
<a id='line_12512'>Castle of Pendragon, and after was made knight of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_12513'></a>
<a id='line_12514'>And in the meanwhile came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Brandiles,</a>
<a id='line_12515'>and anon they fellowshipped with them. And then within ten days, then</a>
<a id='line_12516'>departed those knights of Arthur’s court from these fortresses. And as</a>
<a id='line_12517'>Sir Launcelot came by the Castle of Pendragon there he put Sir Brian de</a>
<a id='line_12518'>les Isles from his lands, for cause he would never be withhold with</a>
<a id='line_12519'>King Arthur; and all that Castle of Pendragon and all the lands thereof</a>
<a id='line_12520'>he gave to Sir La Cote Male Taile. And then Sir Launcelot sent for</a>
<a id='line_12521'>Nerovens that he made once knight, and he made him to have all the rule</a>
<a id='line_12522'>of that castle and of that country, under La Cote Male Taile; and so</a>
<a id='line_12523'>they rode to Arthur’s court all wholly together. And at Pentecost next</a>
<a id='line_12524'>following there was Sir Plenorius and Sir La Cote Male Taile, called</a>
<a id='line_12525'>otherwise by right Sir Breunor le Noire, both made Knights of the Table</a>
<a id='line_12526'>Round; and great lands King Arthur gave them, and there Breunor le</a>
<a id='line_12527'>Noire wedded that damosel Maledisant. And after she was called</a>
<a id='line_12528'>Beauvivante, but ever after for the more part he was called La Cote</a>
<a id='line_12529'>Male Taile; and he proved a passing noble knight, and mighty; and many</a>
<a id='line_12530'>worshipful deeds he did after in his life; and Sir Plenorius proved a</a>
<a id='line_12531'>noble knight and full of prowess, and all the days of their life for</a>
<a id='line_12532'>the most part they awaited upon Sir Launcelot; and Sir Plenorius’</a>
<a id='line_12533'>brethren were ever knights of King Arthur. And also, as the French book</a>
<a id='line_12534'>maketh mention, Sir La Cote Male Taile avenged his father’s death.</a>

<a id='line_12538'>CHAPTER X. How La Beale Isoud sent letters to Sir Tristram by her maid</a>
<a id='line_12539'>Bragwaine, and of divers adventures of Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_12540'></a>
<a id='line_12541'>Now leave we here Sir La Cote Male Taile, and turn we unto Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12542'>de Liones that was in Brittany. When La Beale Isoud understood that he</a>
<a id='line_12543'>was wedded she sent to him by her maiden Bragwaine as piteous letters</a>
<a id='line_12544'>as could be thought and made, and her conclusion was that, an it</a>
<a id='line_12545'>pleased Sir Tristram, that he would come to her court, and bring with</a>
<a id='line_12546'>him Isoud la Blanche Mains, and they should be kept as well as she</a>
<a id='line_12547'>herself. Then Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Kehydius, and asked him</a>
<a id='line_12548'>whether he would go with him into Cornwall secretly. He answered him</a>
<a id='line_12549'>that he was ready at all times. And then he let ordain privily a little</a>
<a id='line_12550'>vessel, and therein they went, Sir Tristram, Kehydius, Dame Bragwaine,</a>
<a id='line_12551'>and Gouvernail, Sir Tristram’s squire. So when they were in the sea a</a>
<a id='line_12552'>contrarious wind blew them on the coasts of North Wales, nigh the</a>
<a id='line_12553'>Castle Perilous. Then said Sir Tristram: Here shall ye abide me these</a>
<a id='line_12554'>ten days, and Gouvernail, my squire, with you. And if so be I come not</a>
<a id='line_12555'>again by that day take the next way into Cornwall; for in this forest</a>
<a id='line_12556'>are many strange adventures, as I have heard say, and some of them I</a>
<a id='line_12557'>cast me to prove or I depart. And when I may I shall hie me after you.</a>
<a id='line_12558'></a>
<a id='line_12559'>Then Sir Tristram and Kehydius took their horses and departed from</a>
<a id='line_12560'>their fellowship. And so they rode within that forest a mile and more;</a>
<a id='line_12561'>and at the last Sir Tristram saw afore him a likely knight, armed,</a>
<a id='line_12562'>sitting by a well, and a strong mighty horse passing nigh him tied to</a>
<a id='line_12563'>an oak, and a man hoving and riding by him leading an horse laden with</a>
<a id='line_12564'>spears. And this knight that sat at the well seemed by his countenance</a>
<a id='line_12565'>to be passing heavy. Then Sir Tristram rode near him and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_12566'>knight, why sit ye so drooping? ye seem to be a knight-errant by your</a>
<a id='line_12567'>arms and harness, and therefore dress you to joust with one of us, or</a>
<a id='line_12568'>with both. Therewithal that knight made no words, but took his shield</a>
<a id='line_12569'>and buckled it about his neck, and lightly he took his horse and leapt</a>
<a id='line_12570'>upon him. And then he took a great spear of his squire, and departed</a>
<a id='line_12571'>his way a furlong. Sir Kehydius asked leave of Sir Tristram to joust</a>
<a id='line_12572'>first. Do your best, said Sir Tristram. So they met together, and there</a>
<a id='line_12573'>Sir Kehydius had a fall, and was sore wounded on high above the paps.</a>
<a id='line_12574'>Then Sir Tristram said: Knight, that is well jousted, now make you</a>
<a id='line_12575'>ready unto me. I am ready, said the knight. And then that knight took a</a>
<a id='line_12576'>greater spear in his hand, and encountered with Sir Tristram, and there</a>
<a id='line_12577'>by great force that knight smote down Sir Tristram from his horse and</a>
<a id='line_12578'>had a great fall. Then Sir Tristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he</a>
<a id='line_12579'>avoided his horse, and put his shield afore his shoulder, and drew his</a>
<a id='line_12580'>sword. And then Sir Tristram required that knight of his knighthood to</a>
<a id='line_12581'>alight upon foot and fight with him. I will well, said the knight; and</a>
<a id='line_12582'>so he alighted upon foot, and avoided his horse, and cast his shield</a>
<a id='line_12583'>upon his shoulder, and drew his sword, and there they fought a long</a>
<a id='line_12584'>battle together full nigh two hours. Then Sir Tristram said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_12585'>knight, hold thine hand, and tell me of whence thou art, and what is</a>
<a id='line_12586'>thy name. As for that, said the knight, I will be avised; but an thou</a>
<a id='line_12587'>wilt tell me thy name peradventure I will tell thee mine.</a>

<a id='line_12592'>they fought, and after accorded never to fight together.</a>
<a id='line_12593'></a>
<a id='line_12594'>Now fair knight, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_12595'>the other knight, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. Ah, Sir Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_12596'>said Sir Tristram, well be we met, and bethink thee now of the despite</a>
<a id='line_12597'>thou didst me of the sending of the horn unto King Mark’s court, to the</a>
<a id='line_12598'>intent to have slain or dishonoured my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud;</a>
<a id='line_12599'>and therefore wit thou well, said Sir Tristram, the one of us shall die</a>
<a id='line_12600'>or we depart. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, remember that we were together in</a>
<a id='line_12601'>the Isle of Servage, and at that time ye promised me great friendship.</a>
<a id='line_12602'>Then Sir Tristram would make no longer delays, but lashed at Sir</a>
<a id='line_12603'>Lamorak; and thus they fought long till either were weary of other.</a>
<a id='line_12604'>Then Sir Tristram said to Sir Lamorak: In all my life met I never with</a>
<a id='line_12605'>such a knight that was so big and well breathed as ye be, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_12606'>said Sir Tristram, it were pity that any of us both should here be</a>
<a id='line_12607'>mischieved. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, for your renown and name I will that</a>
<a id='line_12608'>ye have the worship of this battle, and therefore I will yield me unto</a>
<a id='line_12609'>you. And therewith he took the point of his sword to yield him. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_12610'>said Sir Tristram, ye shall not do so, for well I know your proffers,</a>
<a id='line_12611'>and more of your gentleness than for any fear or dread ye have of me.</a>
<a id='line_12612'>And therewithal Sir Tristram proffered him his sword and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_12613'>Lamorak, as an overcome knight I yield me unto you as to a man of the</a>
<a id='line_12614'>most noble prowess that ever I met withal. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I</a>
<a id='line_12615'>will do you gentleness; I require you let us be sworn together that</a>
<a id='line_12616'>never none of us shall after this day have ado with other. And</a>
<a id='line_12617'>therewithal Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak sware that never none of them</a>
<a id='line_12618'>should fight against other, nor for weal nor for woe.</a>

<a id='line_12622'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Palomides followed the Questing Beast, and smote</a>
<a id='line_12623'>down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak with one spear.</a>
<a id='line_12624'></a>
<a id='line_12625'>And this meanwhile there came Sir Palomides, the good knight, following</a>
<a id='line_12626'>the Questing Beast that had in shape a head like a serpent’s head, and</a>
<a id='line_12627'>a body like a leopard, buttocks like a lion, and footed like an hart;</a>
<a id='line_12628'>and in his body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of</a>
<a id='line_12629'>thirty couple of hounds questing, and such a noise that beast made</a>
<a id='line_12630'>wheresomever he went; and this beast ever more Sir Palomides followed,</a>
<a id='line_12631'>for it was called his quest. And right so as he followed this beast it</a>
<a id='line_12632'>came by Sir Tristram, and soon after came Palomides. And to brief this</a>
<a id='line_12633'>matter he smote down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak both with one spear;</a>
<a id='line_12634'>and so he departed after the beast Galtisant, that was called the</a>
<a id='line_12635'>Questing Beast; wherefore these two knights were passing wroth that Sir</a>
<a id='line_12636'>Palomides would not fight on foot with them. Here men may understand</a>
<a id='line_12637'>that be of worship, that he was never formed that all times might</a>
<a id='line_12638'>stand, but sometime he was put to the worse by mal-fortune; and at</a>
<a id='line_12639'>sometime the worse knight put the better knight to a rebuke.</a>
<a id='line_12640'></a>
<a id='line_12641'>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak gat Sir Kehydius upon a shield</a>
<a id='line_12642'>betwixt them both, and led him to a forester’s lodge, and there they</a>
<a id='line_12643'>gave him in charge to keep him well, and with him they abode three</a>
<a id='line_12644'>days. Then the two knights took their horses and at the cross they</a>
<a id='line_12645'>departed. And then said Sir Tristram to Sir Lamorak: I require you if</a>
<a id='line_12646'>ye hap to meet with Sir Palomides, say him that he shall find me at the</a>
<a id='line_12647'>same well where I met him, and there I, Sir Tristram, shall prove</a>
<a id='line_12648'>whether he be better knight than I. And so either departed from other a</a>
<a id='line_12649'>sundry way, and Sir Tristram rode nigh thereas was Sir Kehydius; and</a>
<a id='line_12650'>Sir Lamorak rode until he came to a chapel, and there he put his horse</a>
<a id='line_12651'>unto pasture. And anon there came Sir Meliagaunce, that was King</a>
<a id='line_12652'>Bagdemagus’ son, and he there put his horse to pasture, and was not</a>
<a id='line_12653'>ware of Sir Lamorak; and then this knight Sir Meliagaunce made his moan</a>
<a id='line_12654'>of the love that he had to Queen Guenever, and there he made a woful</a>
<a id='line_12655'>complaint. All this heard Sir Lamorak, and on the morn Sir Lamorak took</a>
<a id='line_12656'>his horse and rode unto the forest, and there he met with two knights</a>
<a id='line_12657'>hoving under the wood-shaw. Fair knights, said Sir Lamorak, what do ye</a>
<a id='line_12658'>hoving here and watching? and if ye be knights-errant that will joust,</a>
<a id='line_12659'>lo I am ready. Nay, sir knight, they said, not so, we abide not here to</a>
<a id='line_12660'>joust with you, but we lie here in await of a knight that slew our</a>
<a id='line_12661'>brother. What knight was that, said Sir Lamorak, that you would fain</a>
<a id='line_12662'>meet withal? Sir, they said, it is Sir Launcelot that slew our brother,</a>
<a id='line_12663'>and if ever we may meet with him he shall not escape, but we shall slay</a>
<a id='line_12664'>him. Ye take upon you a great charge, said Sir Lamorak, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_12665'>Launcelot is a noble proved knight. As for that we doubt not, for there</a>
<a id='line_12666'>nis none of us but we are good enough for him. I will not believe that,</a>
<a id='line_12667'>said Sir Lamorak, for I heard never yet of no knight the days of my</a>
<a id='line_12668'>life but Sir Launcelot was too big for him.</a>
<a id='line_12669'></a>
<a id='line_12670'></a>
<a id='line_12671'></a>
<a id='line_12672'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought</a>
<a id='line_12673'>together for the beauty of Dame Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_12674'></a>
<a id='line_12675'>Right so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir</a>
<a id='line_12676'>Launcelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted</a>
<a id='line_12677'>him, and he him again. And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir Launcelot if</a>
<a id='line_12678'>there were anything that he might do for him in these marches. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_12679'>said Sir Launcelot, not at this time I thank you. Then either departed</a>
<a id='line_12680'>from other, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas he left the two knights,</a>
<a id='line_12681'>and then he found them hid in the leaved wood. Fie on you, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12682'>Lamorak, false cowards, pity and shame it is that any of you should</a>
<a id='line_12683'>take the high order of knighthood. So Sir Lamorak departed from them,</a>
<a id='line_12684'>and within a while he met with Sir Meliagaunce. And then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_12685'>asked him why he loved Queen Guenever as he did: For I was not far from</a>
<a id='line_12686'>you when ye made your complaint by the chapel. Did ye so? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12687'>Meliagaunce, then will I abide by it: I love Queen Guenever, what will</a>
<a id='line_12688'>ye with it? I will prove and make good that she is the fairest lady and</a>
<a id='line_12689'>most of beauty in the world. As to that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay</a>
<a id='line_12690'>thereto, for Queen Morgawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his</a>
<a id='line_12691'>mother is the fairest queen and lady that beareth the life. That is not</a>
<a id='line_12692'>so, said Sir Meliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy</a>
<a id='line_12693'>body. Will ye so? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not</a>
<a id='line_12694'>to fight. Then they departed either from other in great wrath. And then</a>
<a id='line_12695'>they came riding together as it had been thunder, and either smote</a>
<a id='line_12696'>other so sore that their horses fell backward to the earth. And then</a>
<a id='line_12697'>they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their</a>
<a id='line_12698'>swords. And then they hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they</a>
<a id='line_12699'>fought a great while. For Meliagaunce was a good man and of great</a>
<a id='line_12700'>might, but Sir Lamorak was hard big for him, and put him always aback,</a>
<a id='line_12701'>but either had wounded other sore.</a>
<a id='line_12702'></a>
<a id='line_12703'>And as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_12704'>Bleoberis riding. And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt them, and asked</a>
<a id='line_12705'>them for what cause they fought so together: And ye are both knights of</a>
<a id='line_12706'>King Arthur!</a>
<a id='line_12707'></a>
<a id='line_12708'>Sir, said Meliagaunce, I shall tell you for what cause we do this</a>
<a id='line_12709'>battle. I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the fairest</a>
<a id='line_12710'>lady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he said Queen</a>
<a id='line_12711'>Morgawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of beauty. Ah, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12712'>Lamorak, why sayest thou so? it is not thy part to dispraise thy</a>
<a id='line_12713'>princess that thou art under her obeissance, and we all. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_12714'>he alighted on foot, and said: For this quarrel, make thee ready, for I</a>
<a id='line_12715'>will prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and most</a>
<a id='line_12716'>of bounty in the world. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado</a>
<a id='line_12717'>with you in this quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest;</a>
<a id='line_12718'>and though I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth;</a>
<a id='line_12719'>for though my lady, Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_12720'>Queen Morgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight</a>
<a id='line_12721'>thinketh his own lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir, ye are the man in</a>
<a id='line_12722'>the world except Sir Tristram that I am most loathest to have ado</a>
<a id='line_12723'>withal, but, an ye will needs fight with me I shall endure you as long</a>
<a id='line_12724'>as I may. Then spake Sir Bleoberis and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_12725'>wist you never so misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you</a>
<a id='line_12726'>but reason and knightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh</a>
<a id='line_12727'>that she is the fairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason</a>
<a id='line_12728'>that ye should be wroth with me for such language? And well ye wot,</a>
<a id='line_12729'>that Sir Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know, and he hath ought you</a>
<a id='line_12730'>and us ever good will, and therefore I pray you be good friends. Then</a>
<a id='line_12731'>Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak. I pray you forgive me mine evil</a>
<a id='line_12732'>will, and if I was misadvised I will amend it. Sir, said Sir Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_12733'>the amends is soon made betwixt you and me. And so Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_12734'>Sir Bleoberis departed, and Sir Meliagaunce and Sir Lamorak took their</a>
<a id='line_12735'>horses, and either departed from other.</a>
<a id='line_12736'></a>
<a id='line_12737'>And within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak, and</a>
<a id='line_12738'>jousted with him; and there he smote down Sir Lamorak, and wounded him</a>
<a id='line_12739'>sore with a spear, and so he rode from him; wherefore Sir Lamorak was</a>
<a id='line_12740'>wroth that he would not fight with him on foot, howbeit that Sir</a>
<a id='line_12741'>Lamorak knew not King Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_12745'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Kay met with Sir Tristram, and after of the shame</a>
<a id='line_12746'>spoken of the knights of Cornwall, and how they jousted.</a>
<a id='line_12747'></a>
<a id='line_12748'>Now leave we of this tale, and speak we of Sir Tristram, that as he</a>
<a id='line_12749'>rode he met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal; and there Sir Kay asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_12750'>Tristram of what country he was. He answered that he was of the country</a>
<a id='line_12751'>of Cornwall. It may well be, said Sir Kay, for yet heard I never that</a>
<a id='line_12752'>ever good knight came out of Cornwall. That is evil spoken, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12753'>Tristram, but an it please you to tell me your name I require you. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_12754'>wit ye well, said Sir Kay, that my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal. Is</a>
<a id='line_12755'>that your name? said Sir Tristram, now wit ye well that ye are named</a>
<a id='line_12756'>the shamefullest knight of your tongue that now is living; howbeit ye</a>
<a id='line_12757'>are called a good knight, but ye are called unfortunate, and passing</a>
<a id='line_12758'>overthwart of your tongue. And thus they rode together till they came</a>
<a id='line_12759'>to a bridge. And there was a knight would not let them pass till one of</a>
<a id='line_12760'>them jousted with him; and so that knight jousted with Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_12761'>there that knight gave Sir Kay a fall: his name was Sir Tor, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12762'>Lamorak’s half-brother. And then they two rode to their lodging, and</a>
<a id='line_12763'>there they found Sir Brandiles, and Sir Tor came thither anon after.</a>
<a id='line_12764'>And as they sat at supper these four knights, three of them spake all</a>
<a id='line_12765'>shame by Cornish knights. Sir Tristram heard all that they said and he</a>
<a id='line_12766'>said but little, but he thought the more, but at that time he</a>
<a id='line_12767'>discovered not his name.</a>
<a id='line_12768'></a>
<a id='line_12769'>Upon the morn Sir Tristram took his horse and abode them upon their</a>
<a id='line_12770'>way. And there Sir Brandiles proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_12771'>Sir Tristram smote him down, horse and all, to the earth. Then Sir Tor</a>
<a id='line_12772'>le Fise de Vayshoure encountered with Sir Tristram and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_12773'>Tristram smote him down, and then he rode his way, and Sir Kay followed</a>
<a id='line_12774'>him, but he would not of his fellowship. Then Sir Brandiles came to Sir</a>
<a id='line_12775'>Kay and said: I would wit fain what is that knight’s name. Come on with</a>
<a id='line_12776'>me, said Sir Kay, and we shall pray him to tell us his name. So they</a>
<a id='line_12777'>rode together till they came nigh him, and then they were ware where he</a>
<a id='line_12778'>sat by a well, and had put off his helm to drink at the well. And when</a>
<a id='line_12779'>he saw them come he laced on his helm lightly, and took his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_12780'>proffered them to joust. Nay, said Sir Brandiles, we jousted late</a>
<a id='line_12781'>enough with you, we come not in that intent. But for this we come to</a>
<a id='line_12782'>require you of knighthood to tell us your name. My fair knights, sithen</a>
<a id='line_12783'>that is your desire, and to please you, ye shall wit that my name is</a>
<a id='line_12784'>Sir Tristram de Liones, nephew unto King Mark of Cornwall. In good</a>
<a id='line_12785'>time, said Sir Brandiles, and well be ye found, and wit ye well that we</a>
<a id='line_12786'>be right glad that we have found you, and we be of a fellowship that</a>
<a id='line_12787'>would be right glad of your company. For ye are the knight in the world</a>
<a id='line_12788'>that the noble fellowship of the Round Table most desireth to have the</a>
<a id='line_12789'>company of. God thank them, said Sir Tristram, of their great goodness,</a>
<a id='line_12790'>but as yet I feel well that I am unable to be of their fellowship, for</a>
<a id='line_12791'>I was never yet of such deeds of worthiness to be in the company of</a>
<a id='line_12792'>such a fellowship. Ah, said Sir Kay, an ye be Sir Tristram de Liones,</a>
<a id='line_12793'>ye are the man called now most of prowess except Sir Launcelot du Lake;</a>
<a id='line_12794'>for he beareth not the life, Christian nor heathen, that can find such</a>
<a id='line_12795'>another knight, to speak of his prowess, and of his hands, and his</a>
<a id='line_12796'>truth withal. For yet could there never creature say of him dishonour</a>
<a id='line_12797'>and make it good. Thus they talked a great while, and then they</a>
<a id='line_12798'>departed either from other such ways as them seemed best.</a>

<a id='line_12802'>CHAPTER XV. How King Arthur was brought into the Forest Perilous, and</a>
<a id='line_12803'>how Sir Tristram saved his life.</a>
<a id='line_12804'></a>
<a id='line_12805'>Now shall ye hear what was the cause that King Arthur came into the</a>
<a id='line_12806'>Forest Perilous, that was in North Wales, by the means of a lady. Her</a>
<a id='line_12807'>name was Annowre, and this lady came to King Arthur at Cardiff; and she</a>
<a id='line_12808'>by fair promise and fair behests made King Arthur to ride with her into</a>
<a id='line_12809'>that Forest Perilous; and she was a great sorceress; and many days she</a>
<a id='line_12810'>had loved King Arthur, and because she would have him to lie by her she</a>
<a id='line_12811'>came into that country. So when the king was gone with her many of his</a>
<a id='line_12812'>knights followed after King Arthur when they missed him, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_12813'>Launcelot, Brandiles, and many other; and when she had brought him to</a>
<a id='line_12814'>her tower she desired him to lie by her; and then the king remembered</a>
<a id='line_12815'>him of his lady, and would not lie by her for no craft that she could</a>
<a id='line_12816'>do. Then every day she would make him ride into that forest with his</a>
<a id='line_12817'>own knights, to the intent to have had King Arthur slain. For when this</a>
<a id='line_12818'>Lady Annowre saw that she might not have him at her will, then she</a>
<a id='line_12819'>laboured by false means to have destroyed King Arthur, and slain.</a>
<a id='line_12820'></a>
<a id='line_12821'>Then the Lady of the Lake that was alway friendly to King Arthur, she</a>
<a id='line_12822'>understood by her subtle crafts that King Arthur was like to be</a>
<a id='line_12823'>destroyed. And therefore this Lady of the Lake, that hight Nimue, came</a>
<a id='line_12824'>into that forest to seek after Sir Launcelot du Lake or Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12825'>for to help King Arthur; foras that same day this Lady of the Lake knew</a>
<a id='line_12826'>well that King Arthur should be slain, unless that he had help of one</a>
<a id='line_12827'>of these two knights. And thus she rode up and down till she met with</a>
<a id='line_12828'>Sir Tristram, and anon as she saw him she knew him. O my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_12829'>Tristram, she said, well be ye met, and blessed be the time that I have</a>
<a id='line_12830'>met with you; for this same day, and within these two hours, shall be</a>
<a id='line_12831'>done the foulest deed that ever was done in this land. O fair damosel,</a>
<a id='line_12832'>said Sir Tristram, may I amend it. Come on with me, she said, and that</a>
<a id='line_12833'>in all the haste ye may, for ye shall see the most worshipfullest</a>
<a id='line_12834'>knight of the world hard bestead. Then said Sir Tristram: I am ready to</a>
<a id='line_12835'>help such a noble man. He is neither better nor worse, said the Lady of</a>
<a id='line_12836'>the Lake, but the noble King Arthur himself. God defend, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12837'>Tristram, that ever he should be in such distress. Then they rode</a>
<a id='line_12838'>together a great pace, until they came to a little turret or castle;</a>
<a id='line_12839'>and underneath that castle they saw a knight standing upon foot</a>
<a id='line_12840'>fighting with two knights; and so Sir Tristram beheld them, and at the</a>
<a id='line_12841'>last the two knights smote down the one knight, and that one of them</a>
<a id='line_12842'>unlaced his helm to have slain him. And the Lady Annowre gat King</a>
<a id='line_12843'>Arthur’s sword in her hand to have stricken off his head. And</a>
<a id='line_12844'>therewithal came Sir Tristram with all his might, crying: Traitress,</a>
<a id='line_12845'>traitress, leave that. And anon there Sir Tristram smote the one of the</a>
<a id='line_12846'>knights through the body that he fell dead; and then he rashed to the</a>
<a id='line_12847'>other and smote his back asunder; and in the meanwhile the Lady of the</a>
<a id='line_12848'>Lake cried to King Arthur: Let not that false lady escape. Then King</a>
<a id='line_12849'>Arthur overtook her, and with the same sword he smote off her head, and</a>
<a id='line_12850'>the Lady of the Lake took up her head and hung it up by the hair of her</a>
<a id='line_12851'>saddle-bow. And then Sir Tristram horsed King Arthur and rode forth</a>
<a id='line_12852'>with him, but he charged the Lady of the Lake not to discover his name</a>
<a id='line_12853'>as at that time.</a>
<a id='line_12854'></a>
<a id='line_12855'>When the king was horsed he thanked heartily Sir Tristram, and desired</a>
<a id='line_12856'>to wit his name; but he would not tell him, but that he was a poor</a>
<a id='line_12857'>knight adventurous; and so he bare King Arthur fellowship till he met</a>
<a id='line_12858'>with some of his knights. And within a while he met with Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_12859'>Maris, and he knew not King Arthur nor Sir Tristram, and he desired to</a>
<a id='line_12860'>joust with one of them. Then Sir Tristram rode unto Sir Ector, and</a>
<a id='line_12861'>smote him from his horse. And when he had done so he came again to the</a>
<a id='line_12862'>king and said: My lord, yonder is one of your knights, he may bare you</a>
<a id='line_12863'>fellowship, and another day that deed that I have done for you I trust</a>
<a id='line_12864'>to God ye shall understand that I would do you service. Alas, said King</a>
<a id='line_12865'>Arthur, let me wit what ye are? Not at this time, said Sir Tristram. So</a>
<a id='line_12866'>he departed and left King Arthur and Sir Ector together.</a>

<a id='line_12871'>began to love Beale Isoud, and of a letter that Tristram found.</a>
<a id='line_12872'></a>
<a id='line_12873'>And then at a day set Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak met at the well; and</a>
<a id='line_12874'>then they took Kehydius at the forester’s house, and so they rode with</a>
<a id='line_12875'>him to the ship where they left Dame Bragwaine and Gouvernail, and so</a>
<a id='line_12876'>they sailed into Cornwall all wholly together. And by assent and</a>
<a id='line_12877'>information of Dame Bragwaine when they were landed they rode unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12878'>Dinas, the Seneschal, a trusty friend of Sir Tristram’s. And so Dame</a>
<a id='line_12879'>Bragwaine and Sir Dinas rode to the court of King Mark, and told the</a>
<a id='line_12880'>queen, La Beale Isoud, that Sir Tristram was nigh her in that country.</a>
<a id='line_12881'>Then for very pure joy La Beale Isoud swooned; and when she might speak</a>
<a id='line_12882'>she said: Gentle knight Seneschal, help that I might speak with him,</a>
<a id='line_12883'>outher my heart will brast. Then Sir Dinas and Dame Bragwaine brought</a>
<a id='line_12884'>Sir Tristram and Kehydius privily unto the court, unto a chamber</a>
<a id='line_12885'>whereas La Beale Isoud had assigned it; and to tell the joys that were</a>
<a id='line_12886'>betwixt La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram, there is no tongue can tell</a>
<a id='line_12887'>it, nor heart think it, nor pen write it. And as the French book maketh</a>
<a id='line_12888'>mention, at the first time that ever Sir Kehydius saw La Beale Isoud he</a>
<a id='line_12889'>was so enamoured upon her that for very pure love he might never</a>
<a id='line_12890'>withdraw it. And at the last, as ye shall hear or the book be ended,</a>
<a id='line_12891'>Sir Kehydius died for the love of La Beale Isoud. And then privily he</a>
<a id='line_12892'>wrote unto her letters and ballads of the most goodliest that were used</a>
<a id='line_12893'>in those days. And when La Beale Isoud understood his letters she had</a>
<a id='line_12894'>pity of his complaint, and unavised she wrote another letter to comfort</a>
<a id='line_12895'>him withal.</a>
<a id='line_12896'></a>
<a id='line_12897'>And Sir Tristram was all this while in a turret at the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_12898'>La Beale Isoud, and when she might she came unto Sir Tristram. So on a</a>
<a id='line_12899'>day King Mark played at the chess under a chamber window; and at that</a>
<a id='line_12900'>time Sir Tristram and Sir Kehydius were within the chamber over King</a>
<a id='line_12901'>Mark, and as it mishapped Sir Tristram found the letter that Kehydius</a>
<a id='line_12902'>sent unto La Beale Isoud, also he had found the letter that she wrote</a>
<a id='line_12903'>unto Kehydius, and at that same time La Beale Isoud was in the same</a>
<a id='line_12904'>chamber. Then Sir Tristram came unto La Beale Isoud and said: Madam,</a>
<a id='line_12905'>here is a letter that was sent unto you, and here is the letter that ye</a>
<a id='line_12906'>sent unto him that sent you that letter. Alas, Madam, the good love</a>
<a id='line_12907'>that I have loved you; and many lands and riches have I forsaken for</a>
<a id='line_12908'>your love, and now ye are a traitress to me, the which doth me great</a>
<a id='line_12909'>pain. But as for thee, Sir Kehydius, I brought thee out of Brittany</a>
<a id='line_12910'>into this country, and thy father, King Howel, I won his lands, howbeit</a>
<a id='line_12911'>I wedded thy sister Isoud la Blanche Mains for the goodness she did</a>
<a id='line_12912'>unto me. And yet, as I am true knight, she is a clean maiden for me;</a>
<a id='line_12913'>but wit thou well, Sir Kehydius, for this falsehood and treason thou</a>
<a id='line_12914'>hast done me, I will revenge it upon thee. And therewithal Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12915'>drew out his sword and said: Sir Kehydius, keep thee, and then La Beale</a>
<a id='line_12916'>Isoud swooned to the earth. And when Sir Kehydius saw Sir Tristram come</a>
<a id='line_12917'>upon him he saw none other boot, but leapt out at a bay-window even</a>
<a id='line_12918'>over the head where sat King Mark playing at the chess. And when the</a>
<a id='line_12919'>king saw one come hurling over his head he said: Fellow, what art thou,</a>
<a id='line_12920'>and what is the cause thou leapest out at that window? My lord the</a>
<a id='line_12921'>king, said Kehydius, it fortuned me that I was asleep in the window</a>
<a id='line_12922'>above your head, and as I slept I slumbered, and so I fell down. And</a>
<a id='line_12923'>thus Sir Kehydius excused him.</a>

<a id='line_12926'></a>
<a id='line_12927'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram departed from Tintagil, and how he</a>
<a id='line_12928'>sorrowed and was so long in a forest till he was out of his mind.</a>
<a id='line_12929'></a>
<a id='line_12930'>Then Sir Tristram dread sore lest he were discovered unto the king that</a>
<a id='line_12931'>he was there; wherefore he drew him to the strength of the Tower, and</a>
<a id='line_12932'>armed him in such armour as he had for to fight with them that would</a>
<a id='line_12933'>withstand him. And so when Sir Tristram saw there was no resistance</a>
<a id='line_12934'>against him he sent Gouvernail for his horse and his spear, and</a>
<a id='line_12935'>knightly he rode forth out of the castle openly, that was called the</a>
<a id='line_12936'>Castle of Tintagil. And even at gate he met with Gingalin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12937'>Gawaine’s son. And anon Sir Gingalin put his spear in his rest, and ran</a>
<a id='line_12938'>upon Sir Tristram and brake his spear; and Sir Tristram at that time</a>
<a id='line_12939'>had but a sword, and gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell</a>
<a id='line_12940'>down from his saddle, and his sword slid adown, and carved asunder his</a>
<a id='line_12941'>horse’s neck. And so Sir Tristram rode his way into the forest, and all</a>
<a id='line_12942'>this doing saw King Mark. And then he sent a squire unto the hurt</a>
<a id='line_12943'>knight, and commanded him to come to him, and so he did. And when King</a>
<a id='line_12944'>Mark wist that it was Sir Gingalin he welcomed him and gave him an</a>
<a id='line_12945'>horse, and asked him what knight it was that had encountered with him.</a>
<a id='line_12946'>Sir, said Gingalin, I wot not what knight he was, but well I wot that</a>
<a id='line_12947'>he sigheth and maketh great dole.</a>
<a id='line_12948'></a>
<a id='line_12949'>Then Sir Tristram within a while met with a knight of his own, that</a>
<a id='line_12950'>hight Sir Fergus. And when he had met with him he made great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_12951'>insomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow</a>
<a id='line_12952'>he was in three days and three nights. Then at the last Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_12953'>sent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for to spere what tidings. And so as</a>
<a id='line_12954'>he rode by the way he met with a damosel that came from Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_12955'>to know and seek how Sir Tristram did. Then Sir Fergus told her how he</a>
<a id='line_12956'>was almost out of his mind. Alas, said the damosel, where shall I find</a>
<a id='line_12957'>him? In such a place, said Sir Fergus. Then Sir Fergus found Queen</a>
<a id='line_12958'>Isoud sick in her bed, making the greatest dole that ever any earthly</a>
<a id='line_12959'>woman made. And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she made great dole</a>
<a id='line_12960'>because she might not amend him, for the more she made of him the more</a>
<a id='line_12961'>was his pain. And at the last Sir Tristram took his horse and rode away</a>
<a id='line_12962'>from her. And then was it three days or that she could find him, and</a>
<a id='line_12963'>then she brought him meat and drink, but he would none; and then</a>
<a id='line_12964'>another time Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and it happed</a>
<a id='line_12965'>him to ride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram did</a>
<a id='line_12966'>battle when La Beale Isoud departed them. And there by fortune the</a>
<a id='line_12967'>damosel met with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest dole that ever</a>
<a id='line_12968'>earthly creature made; and she yede to the lady of that castle and told</a>
<a id='line_12969'>her of the misadventure of Sir Tristram. Alas, said the lady of that</a>
<a id='line_12970'>castle, where is my lord, Sir Tristram? Right here by your castle, said</a>
<a id='line_12971'>the damosel. In good time, said the lady, is he so nigh me; he shall</a>
<a id='line_12972'>have meat and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his whereupon he</a>
<a id='line_12973'>taught me, for of goodly harping he beareth the prize in the world. So</a>
<a id='line_12974'>this lady and damosel brought him meat and drink, but he ate little</a>
<a id='line_12975'>thereof. Then upon a night he put his horse from him, and then he</a>
<a id='line_12976'>unlaced his armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_12977'>and brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he found the</a>
<a id='line_12978'>harp that the lady sent him, then would he harp, and play thereupon and</a>
<a id='line_12979'>weep together. And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the</a>
<a id='line_12980'>lady wist not where he was, then would she sit her down and play upon</a>
<a id='line_12981'>that harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken</a>
<a id='line_12982'>thereto, and sometime he would harp himself. Thus he there endured a</a>
<a id='line_12983'>quarter of a year. Then at the last he ran his way, and she wist not</a>
<a id='line_12984'>where he was become. And then was he naked and waxed lean and poor of</a>
<a id='line_12985'>flesh; and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds, and</a>
<a id='line_12986'>daily they would give him some of their meat and drink. And when he did</a>
<a id='line_12987'>any shrewd deed they would beat him with rods, and so they clipped him</a>
<a id='line_12988'>with shears and made him like a fool.</a>

<a id='line_12990'></a>
<a id='line_12991'></a>
<a id='line_12992'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Tristram soused Dagonet in a well, and how</a>
<a id='line_12993'>Palomides sent a damosel to seek Tristram, and how Palomides met with</a>
<a id='line_12994'>King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_12995'></a>
<a id='line_12996'>And upon a day Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, came into Cornwall with two</a>
<a id='line_12997'>squires with him; and as they rode through that forest they came by a</a>
<a id='line_12998'>fair well where Sir Tristram was wont to be; and the weather was hot,</a>
<a id='line_12999'>and they alighted to drink of that well, and in the meanwhile their</a>
<a id='line_13000'>horses brake loose. Right so Sir Tristram came unto them, and first he</a>
<a id='line_13001'>soused Sir Dagonet in that well, and after his squires, and thereat</a>
<a id='line_13002'>laughed the shepherds; and forthwithal he ran after their horses and</a>
<a id='line_13003'>brought them again one by one, and right so, wet as they were, he made</a>
<a id='line_13004'>them leap up and ride their ways. Thus Sir Tristram endured there an</a>
<a id='line_13005'>half year naked, and would never come in town nor village. The</a>
<a id='line_13006'>meanwhile the damosel that Sir Palomides sent to seek Sir Tristram, she</a>
<a id='line_13007'>yede unto Sir Palomides and told him all the mischief that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13008'>endured. Alas, said Sir Palomides, it is great pity that ever so noble</a>
<a id='line_13009'>a knight should be so mischieved for the love of a lady; but</a>
<a id='line_13010'>nevertheless, I will go and seek him, and comfort him an I may. Then a</a>
<a id='line_13011'>little before that time La Beale Isoud had commanded Sir Kehydius out</a>
<a id='line_13012'>of the country of Cornwall. So Sir Kehydius departed with a dolorous</a>
<a id='line_13013'>heart, and by adventure he met with Sir Palomides, and they</a>
<a id='line_13014'>enfellowshipped together; and either complained to other of their hot</a>
<a id='line_13015'>love that they loved La Beale Isoud. Now let us, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_13016'>seek Sir Tristram, that loved her as well as we, and let us prove</a>
<a id='line_13017'>whether we may recover him. So they rode into that forest, and three</a>
<a id='line_13018'>days and three nights they would never take their lodging, but ever</a>
<a id='line_13019'>sought Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13020'></a>
<a id='line_13021'>And upon a time, by adventure, they met with King Mark that was ridden</a>
<a id='line_13022'>from his men all alone. When they saw him Sir Palomides knew him, but</a>
<a id='line_13023'>Sir Kehydius knew him not. Ah, false king, said Sir Palomides, it is</a>
<a id='line_13024'>pity thou hast thy life, for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful</a>
<a id='line_13025'>knights, and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroyed that</a>
<a id='line_13026'>most noble knight, Sir Tristram de Liones. And therefore defend thee,</a>
<a id='line_13027'>said Sir Palomides, for thou shalt die this day. That were shame, said</a>
<a id='line_13028'>King Mark, for ye two are armed and I am unarmed. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13029'>Palomides, I shall find a remedy therefore; here is a knight with me,</a>
<a id='line_13030'>and thou shalt have his harness. Nay, said King Mark, I will not have</a>
<a id='line_13031'>ado with you, for cause have ye none to me; for all the misease that</a>
<a id='line_13032'>Sir Tristram hath was for a letter that he found; for as to me I did to</a>
<a id='line_13033'>him no displeasure, and God knoweth I am full sorry for his disease and</a>
<a id='line_13034'>malady. So when the king had thus excused him they were friends, and</a>
<a id='line_13035'>King Mark would have had them unto Tintagil; but Sir Palomides would</a>
<a id='line_13036'>not, but turned unto the realm of Logris, and Sir Kehydius said that he</a>
<a id='line_13037'>would go into Brittany.</a>
<a id='line_13038'></a>
<a id='line_13039'>Now turn we unto Sir Dagonet again, that when he and his squires were</a>
<a id='line_13040'>upon horseback he deemed that the shepherds had sent that fool to array</a>
<a id='line_13041'>them so, because that they laughed at them, and so they rode unto the</a>
<a id='line_13042'>keepers of beasts and all to-beat them. Sir Tristram saw them beat that</a>
<a id='line_13043'>were wont to give him meat and drink, then he ran thither and gat Sir</a>
<a id='line_13044'>Dagonet by the head, and gave him such a fall to the earth that he</a>
<a id='line_13045'>bruised him sore so that he lay still. And then he wrast his sword out</a>
<a id='line_13046'>of his hand, and therewith he ran to one of his squires and smote off</a>
<a id='line_13047'>his head, and the other fled. And so Sir Tristram took his way with</a>
<a id='line_13048'>that sword in his hand, running as he had been wild wood. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13049'>Dagonet rode to King Mark and told him how he had sped in that forest.</a>
<a id='line_13050'>And therefore, said Sir Dagonet, beware, King Mark, that thou come not</a>
<a id='line_13051'>about that well in the forest, for there is a fool naked, and that fool</a>
<a id='line_13052'>and I fool met together, and he had almost slain me. Ah, said King</a>
<a id='line_13053'>Mark, that is Sir Matto le Breune, that fell out of his wit because he</a>
<a id='line_13054'>lost his lady; for when Sir Gaheris smote down Sir Matto and won his</a>
<a id='line_13055'>lady of him, never since was he in his mind, and that was pity, for he</a>
<a id='line_13056'>was a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_13057'></a>
<a id='line_13058'></a>
<a id='line_13059'></a>
<a id='line_13060'>CHAPTER XIX. How it was noised how Sir Tristram was dead, and how La</a>
<a id='line_13061'>Beale Isoud would have slain herself.</a>
<a id='line_13062'></a>
<a id='line_13063'>Then Sir Andred, that was cousin unto Sir Tristram, made a lady that</a>
<a id='line_13064'>was his paramour to say and to noise it that she was with Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13065'>or ever he died. And this tale she brought unto King Mark’s court, that</a>
<a id='line_13066'>she buried him by a well, and that or he died he besought King Mark to</a>
<a id='line_13067'>make his cousin, Sir Andred, king of the country of Liones, of the</a>
<a id='line_13068'>which Sir Tristram was lord of. All this did Sir Andred because he</a>
<a id='line_13069'>would have had Sir Tristram’s lands. And when King Mark heard tell that</a>
<a id='line_13070'>Sir Tristram was dead he wept and made great dole. But when Queen Isoud</a>
<a id='line_13071'>heard of these tidings she made such sorrow that she was nigh out of</a>
<a id='line_13072'>her mind; and so upon a day she thought to slay herself and never to</a>
<a id='line_13073'>live after Sir Tristram’s death. And so upon a day La Beale Isoud gat a</a>
<a id='line_13074'>sword privily and bare it to her garden, and there she pight the sword</a>
<a id='line_13075'>through a plum tree up to the hilt, so that it stuck fast, and it stood</a>
<a id='line_13076'>breast high. And as she would have run upon the sword and to have slain</a>
<a id='line_13077'>herself all this espied King Mark, how she kneeled down and said: Sweet</a>
<a id='line_13078'>Lord Jesu, have mercy upon me, for I may not live after the death of</a>
<a id='line_13079'>Sir Tristram de Liones, for he was my first love and he shall be the</a>
<a id='line_13080'>last. And with these words came King Mark and took her in his arms, and</a>
<a id='line_13081'>then he took up the sword, and bare her away with him into a tower; and</a>
<a id='line_13082'>there he made her to be kept, and watched her surely, and after that</a>
<a id='line_13083'>she lay long sick, nigh at the point of death.</a>
<a id='line_13084'></a>
<a id='line_13085'>This meanwhile ran Sir Tristram naked in the forest with the sword in</a>
<a id='line_13086'>his hand, and so he came to an hermitage, and there he laid him down</a>
<a id='line_13087'>and slept; and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_13088'>laid meat down by him. Thus was he kept there ten days; and at the last</a>
<a id='line_13089'>he departed and came to the herdmen again. And there was a giant in</a>
<a id='line_13090'>that country that hight Tauleas, and for fear of Sir Tristram more than</a>
<a id='line_13091'>seven year he durst never much go at large, but for the most part he</a>
<a id='line_13092'>kept him in a sure castle of his own; and so this Tauleas heard tell</a>
<a id='line_13093'>that Sir Tristram was dead, by the noise of the court of King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_13094'>Then this Tauleas went daily at large. And so he happed upon a day he</a>
<a id='line_13095'>came to the herdmen wandering and langering, and there he set him down</a>
<a id='line_13096'>to rest among them. The meanwhile there came a knight of Cornwall that</a>
<a id='line_13097'>led a lady with him, and his name was Sir Dinant; and when the giant</a>
<a id='line_13098'>saw him he went from the herdmen and hid him under a tree, and so the</a>
<a id='line_13099'>knight came to that well, and there he alighted to repose him. And as</a>
<a id='line_13100'>soon as he was from his horse this giant Tauleas came betwixt this</a>
<a id='line_13101'>knight and his horse, and took the horse and leapt upon him. So</a>
<a id='line_13102'>forthwith he rode unto Sir Dinant and took him by the collar, and</a>
<a id='line_13103'>pulled him afore him upon his horse, and there would have stricken off</a>
<a id='line_13104'>his head. Then the herdmen said unto Sir Tristram: Help yonder knight.</a>
<a id='line_13105'>Help ye him, said Sir Tristram. We dare not, said the herdmen. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13106'>Tristram was ware of the sword of the knight thereas it lay; and so</a>
<a id='line_13107'>thither he ran and took up the sword and struck off Sir Tauleas’ head,</a>
<a id='line_13108'>and so he yede his way to the herdmen.</a>

<a id='line_13112'>CHAPTER XX. How King Mark found Sir Tristram naked, and made him to be</a>
<a id='line_13113'>borne home to Tintagil, and how he was there known by a brachet.</a>
<a id='line_13114'></a>
<a id='line_13115'>Then the knight took up the giant’s head and bare it with him unto King</a>
<a id='line_13116'>Mark, and told him what adventure betid him in the forest, and how a</a>
<a id='line_13117'>naked man rescued him from the grimly giant, Tauleas. Where had ye this</a>
<a id='line_13118'>adventure? said King Mark. Forsooth, said Sir Dinant, at the fair</a>
<a id='line_13119'>fountain in your forest where many adventurous knights meet, and there</a>
<a id='line_13120'>is the mad man. Well, said King Mark, I will see that wild man. So</a>
<a id='line_13121'>within a day or two King Mark commanded his knights and his hunters</a>
<a id='line_13122'>that they should be ready on the morn for to hunt, and so upon the morn</a>
<a id='line_13123'>he went unto that forest. And when the king came to that well he found</a>
<a id='line_13124'>there lying by that well a fair naked man, and a sword by him. Then</a>
<a id='line_13125'>King Mark blew and straked, and therewith his knights came to him; and</a>
<a id='line_13126'>then the king commanded his knights to: Take that naked man with</a>
<a id='line_13127'>fairness, and bring him to my castle. So they did softly and fair, and</a>
<a id='line_13128'>cast mantles upon Sir Tristram, and so led him unto Tintagil; and there</a>
<a id='line_13129'>they bathed him, and washed him, and gave him hot suppings till they</a>
<a id='line_13130'>had brought him well to his remembrance; but all this while there was</a>
<a id='line_13131'>no creature that knew Sir Tristram, nor what man he was.</a>
<a id='line_13132'></a>
<a id='line_13133'>So it fell upon a day that the queen, La Beale Isoud, heard of such a</a>
<a id='line_13134'>man, that ran naked in the forest, and how the king had brought him</a>
<a id='line_13135'>home to the court. Then La Beale Isoud called unto her Dame Bragwaine</a>
<a id='line_13136'>and said: Come on with me, for we will go see this man that my lord</a>
<a id='line_13137'>brought from the forest the last day. So they passed forth, and spered</a>
<a id='line_13138'>where was the sick man. And then a squire told the queen that he was in</a>
<a id='line_13139'>the garden taking his rest, and reposing him against the sun. So when</a>
<a id='line_13140'>the queen looked upon Sir Tristram she was not remembered of him. But</a>
<a id='line_13141'>ever she said unto Dame Bragwaine: Meseemeth I should have seen him</a>
<a id='line_13142'>heretofore in many places. But as soon as Sir Tristram saw her he knew</a>
<a id='line_13143'>her well enough. And then he turned away his visage and wept.</a>
<a id='line_13144'></a>
<a id='line_13145'>Then the queen had always a little brachet with her that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13146'>gave her the first time that ever she came into Cornwall, and never</a>
<a id='line_13147'>would that brachet depart from her but if Sir Tristram was nigh thereas</a>
<a id='line_13148'>was La Beale Isoud; and this brachet was sent from the king’s daughter</a>
<a id='line_13149'>of France unto Sir Tristram for great love. And anon as this little</a>
<a id='line_13150'>brachet felt a savour of Sir Tristram, she leapt upon him and licked</a>
<a id='line_13151'>his lears and his ears, and then she whined and quested, and she</a>
<a id='line_13152'>smelled at his feet and at his hands, and on all parts of his body that</a>
<a id='line_13153'>she might come to. Ah, my lady, said Dame Bragwaine unto La Beale</a>
<a id='line_13154'>Isoud, alas, alas, said she, I see it is mine own lord, Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13155'>And thereupon Isoud fell down in a swoon, and so lay a great while. And</a>
<a id='line_13156'>when she might speak she said: My lord Sir Tristram, blessed be God ye</a>
<a id='line_13157'>have your life, and now I am sure ye shall be discovered by this little</a>
<a id='line_13158'>brachet, for she will never leave you. And also I am sure as soon as my</a>
<a id='line_13159'>lord, King Mark, do know you he will banish you out of the country of</a>
<a id='line_13160'>Cornwall, or else he will destroy you; for God’s sake, mine own lord,</a>
<a id='line_13161'>grant King Mark his will, and then draw you unto the court of King</a>
<a id='line_13162'>Arthur, for there are ye beloved, and ever when I may I shall send unto</a>
<a id='line_13163'>you; and when ye list ye may come to me, and at all times early and</a>
<a id='line_13164'>late I will be at your commandment, to live as poor a life as ever did</a>
<a id='line_13165'>queen or lady. O Madam, said Sir Tristram, go from me, for mickle anger</a>
<a id='line_13166'>and danger have I escaped for your love.</a>

<a id='line_13170'>CHAPTER XXI. How King Mark, by the advice of his council, banished Sir</a>
<a id='line_13171'>Tristram out of Cornwall the term of ten years.</a>
<a id='line_13172'></a>
<a id='line_13173'>Then the queen departed, but the brachet would not from him; and</a>
<a id='line_13174'>therewithal came King Mark, and the brachet set upon him, and bayed at</a>
<a id='line_13175'>them all. There withal Sir Andred spake and said: Sir, this is Sir</a>
<a id='line_13176'>Tristram, I see by the brachet. Nay, said the king, I cannot suppose</a>
<a id='line_13177'>that. Then the king asked him upon his faith what he was, and what was</a>
<a id='line_13178'>his name. So God me help, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones;</a>
<a id='line_13179'>now do by me what ye list. Ah, said King Mark, me repenteth of your</a>
<a id='line_13180'>recovery. And then he let call his barons to judge Sir Tristram to the</a>
<a id='line_13181'>death. Then many of his barons would not assent thereto, and in</a>
<a id='line_13182'>especial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Fergus. And so by the advice</a>
<a id='line_13183'>of them all Sir Tristram was banished out of the country for ten year,</a>
<a id='line_13184'>and thereupon he took his oath upon a book before the king and his</a>
<a id='line_13185'>barons. And so he was made to depart out of the country of Cornwall;</a>
<a id='line_13186'>and there were many barons brought him unto his ship, of the which some</a>
<a id='line_13187'>were his friends and some his foes. And in the meanwhile there came a</a>
<a id='line_13188'>knight of King Arthur’s, his name was Dinadan, and his coming was for</a>
<a id='line_13189'>to seek after Sir Tristram; then they showed him where he was armed at</a>
<a id='line_13190'>all points going to the ship. Now fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, or ye</a>
<a id='line_13191'>pass this court that ye will joust with me I require thee. With a good</a>
<a id='line_13192'>will, said Sir Tristram, an these lords will give me leave. Then the</a>
<a id='line_13193'>barons granted thereto, and so they ran together, and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_13194'>Tristram gave Sir Dinadan a fall. And then he prayed Sir Tristram to</a>
<a id='line_13195'>give him leave to go in his fellowship. Ye shall be right welcome, said</a>
<a id='line_13196'>then Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13197'></a>
<a id='line_13198'>And so they took their horses and rode to their ships together, and</a>
<a id='line_13199'>when Sir Tristram was in the sea he said: Greet well King Mark and all</a>
<a id='line_13200'>mine enemies, and say them I will come again when I may; and well am I</a>
<a id='line_13201'>rewarded for the fighting with Sir Marhaus, and delivered all this</a>
<a id='line_13202'>country from servage; and well am I rewarded for the fetching and costs</a>
<a id='line_13203'>of Queen Isoud out of Ireland, and the danger that I was in first and</a>
<a id='line_13204'>last, and by the way coming home what danger I had to bring again Queen</a>
<a id='line_13205'>Isoud from the Castle Pluere; and well am I rewarded when I fought with</a>
<a id='line_13206'>Sir Bleoberis for Sir Segwarides’ wife; and well am I rewarded when I</a>
<a id='line_13207'>fought with Sir Blamore de Ganis for King Anguish, father unto La Beale</a>

<a id='line_13209'>Lamorak de Galis, at King Mark’s request; and well am I rewarded when I</a>
<a id='line_13210'>fought with the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13211'>Northgalis, and both these would have put his land in servage, and by</a>
<a id='line_13212'>me they were put to a rebuke; and well am I rewarded for the slaying of</a>
<a id='line_13213'>Tauleas, the mighty giant, and many other deeds have I done for him,</a>
<a id='line_13214'>and now have I my warison. And tell King Mark that many noble knights</a>

<a id='line_13216'>Also am I not well rewarded when I fought with the good knight Sir</a>

<a id='line_13236'>trappings embroidered with crowns. And then Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13237'>Dinadan departed from them into a forest, and there met them a damosel</a>
<a id='line_13238'>that came for the love of Sir Launcelot to seek after some noble</a>
<a id='line_13239'>knights of King Arthur’s court for to rescue Sir Launcelot. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_13240'>Launcelot was ordained, for-by the treason of Queen Morgan le Fay to</a>
<a id='line_13241'>have slain Sir Launcelot, and for that cause she ordained thirty</a>
<a id='line_13242'>knights to lie in await for Sir Launcelot, and this damosel knew this</a>
<a id='line_13243'>treason. And for this cause the damosel came for to seek noble knights</a>
<a id='line_13244'>to help Sir Launcelot. For that night, or the day after, Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13245'>should come where these thirty knights were. And so this damosel met</a>
<a id='line_13246'>with Sir Bors and Sir Ector and with Sir Driant, and there she told</a>
<a id='line_13247'>them all four of the treason of Morgan le Fay; and then they promised</a>
<a id='line_13248'>her that they would be nigh where Sir Launcelot should meet with the</a>
<a id='line_13249'>thirty knights. And if so be they set upon him we will do rescues as we</a>
<a id='line_13250'>can.</a>
<a id='line_13251'></a>
<a id='line_13252'>So the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_13253'>Tristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there the damosel told them all the</a>
<a id='line_13254'>treason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13255'>Tristram, bring me to that same place where they should meet with Sir</a>
<a id='line_13256'>Launcelot. Then said Sir Dinadan: What will ye do? it is not for us to</a>
<a id='line_13257'>fight with thirty knights, and wit you well I will not thereof; as to</a>
<a id='line_13258'>match one knight two or three is enough an they be men, but for to</a>
<a id='line_13259'>match fifteen knights that will I never undertake. Fie for shame, said</a>
<a id='line_13260'>Sir Tristram, do but your part. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will not</a>
<a id='line_13261'>thereof but if ye will lend me your shield, for ye bear a shield of</a>
<a id='line_13262'>Cornwall; and for the cowardice that is named to the knights of</a>
<a id='line_13263'>Cornwall, by your shields ye be ever forborne. Nay, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_13264'>I will not depart from my shield for her sake that gave it me. But one</a>
<a id='line_13265'>thing, said Sir Tristram, I promise thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_13266'>promise me to abide with me, here I shall slay thee, for I desire no</a>
<a id='line_13267'>more of thee but answer one knight. And if thy heart will not serve</a>
<a id='line_13268'>thee, stand by and look upon me and them. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_13269'>promise you to look upon and to do what I may to save myself, but I</a>
<a id='line_13270'>would I had not met with you.</a>
<a id='line_13271'></a>
<a id='line_13272'>So then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four knights, and</a>
<a id='line_13273'>they were ware of them, and either of other. And so these thirty</a>
<a id='line_13274'>knights let them pass, for this cause, that they would not wrath them,</a>
<a id='line_13275'>if case be that they had ado with Sir Launcelot; and the four knights</a>
<a id='line_13276'>let them pass to this intent, that they would see and behold what they</a>
<a id='line_13277'>would do with Sir Launcelot. And so the thirty knights passed on and</a>
<a id='line_13278'>came by Sir Tristram and by Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on</a>
<a id='line_13279'>high: Lo, here is a knight against you for the love of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_13280'>And there he slew two with one spear and ten with his sword. And then</a>
<a id='line_13281'>came in Sir Dinadan and he did passing well, and so of the thirty</a>
<a id='line_13282'>knights there went but ten away, and they fled. All this battle saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_13283'>Bors de Ganis and his three fellows, and then they saw well it was the</a>
<a id='line_13284'>same knight that jousted with them at the bridge; then they took their</a>
<a id='line_13285'>horses and rode unto Sir Tristram, and praised him and thanked him of</a>
<a id='line_13286'>his good deeds, and they all desired Sir Tristram to go with them to</a>
<a id='line_13287'>their lodging; and he said: Nay, he would not go to no lodging. Then</a>
<a id='line_13288'>they all four knights prayed him to tell them his name. Fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_13289'>said Sir Tristram, as at this time I will not tell you my name.</a>
<a id='line_13290'></a>
<a id='line_13291'></a>
<a id='line_13292'></a>
<a id='line_13293'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan came to a lodging where</a>
<a id='line_13294'>they must joust with two knights.</a>
<a id='line_13295'></a>
<a id='line_13296'>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode forth their way till they came</a>
<a id='line_13297'>to the shepherds and to the herdmen, and there they asked them if they</a>
<a id='line_13298'>knew any lodging or harbour there nigh hand. Forsooth, sirs, said the</a>
<a id='line_13299'>herdmen, hereby is good lodging in a castle; but there is such a custom</a>
<a id='line_13300'>that there shall no knight be harboured but if he joust with two</a>
<a id='line_13301'>knights, and if he be but one knight he must joust with two. And as ye</a>
<a id='line_13302'>be therein soon shall ye be matched. There is shrewd harbour, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13303'>Dinadan; lodge where ye will, for I will not lodge there. Fie for</a>
<a id='line_13304'>shame, said Sir Tristram, are ye not a knight of the Table Round?</a>
<a id='line_13305'>wherefore ye may not with your worship refuse your lodging. Not so,</a>
<a id='line_13306'>said the herdmen, for an ye be beaten and have the worse ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_13307'>be lodged there, and if ye beat them ye shall be well harboured. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_13308'>said Sir Dinadan, they are two sure knights. Then Sir Dinadan would not</a>
<a id='line_13309'>lodge there in no manner but as Sir Tristram required him of his</a>
<a id='line_13310'>knighthood; and so they rode thither. And to make short tale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13311'>Tristram and Sir Dinadan smote them down both, and so they entered into</a>
<a id='line_13312'>the castle and had good cheer as they could think or devise.</a>
<a id='line_13313'></a>
<a id='line_13314'>And when they were unarmed, and thought to be merry and in good rest,</a>
<a id='line_13315'>there came in at the gates Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris, requiring to</a>
<a id='line_13316'>have the custom of the castle. What array is this? said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_13317'>would have my rest. That may not be, said Sir Tristram; now must we</a>
<a id='line_13318'>needs defend the custom of this castle, insomuch as we have the better</a>
<a id='line_13319'>of the lords of this castle, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, needs</a>
<a id='line_13320'>must ye make you ready. In the devil’s name, said Sir Dinadan, came I</a>
<a id='line_13321'>into your company. And so they made them ready; and Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_13322'>encountered with Sir Tristram, and Sir Gaheris had a fall; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13323'>Palomides encountered with Sir Dinadan, and Sir Dinadan had a fall:</a>
<a id='line_13324'>then was it fall for fall. So then must they fight on foot. That would</a>
<a id='line_13325'>not Sir Dinadan, for he was so sore bruised of the fall that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13326'>Palomides gave him. Then Sir Tristram unlaced Sir Dinadan’s helm, and</a>
<a id='line_13327'>prayed him to help him. I will not, said Sir Dinadan, for I am sore</a>
<a id='line_13328'>wounded of the thirty knights that we had but late ago to do withal.</a>
<a id='line_13329'>But ye fare, said Sir Dinadan unto Sir Tristram, as a madman and as a</a>
<a id='line_13330'>man that is out of his mind that would cast himself away, and I may</a>
<a id='line_13331'>curse the time that ever I saw you, for in all the world are not two</a>
<a id='line_13332'>such knights that be so wood as is Sir Launcelot and ye Sir Tristram;</a>
<a id='line_13333'>for once I fell in the fellowship of Sir Launcelot as I have done now</a>
<a id='line_13334'>with you, and he set me a work that a quarter of a year I kept my bed.</a>
<a id='line_13335'>Jesu defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from such two knights, and specially</a>
<a id='line_13336'>from your fellowship. Then, said Sir Tristram, I will fight with them</a>
<a id='line_13337'>both. Then Sir Tristram bade them come forth both, for I will fight</a>
<a id='line_13338'>with you. Then Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris dressed them, and smote at</a>
<a id='line_13339'>them both. Then Dinadan smote at Sir Gaheris a stroke or two, and</a>
<a id='line_13340'>turned from him. Nay, said Sir Palomides, it is too much shame for us</a>
<a id='line_13341'>two knights to fight with one. And then he did bid Sir Gaheris stand</a>
<a id='line_13342'>aside with that knight that hath no list to fight. Then they rode</a>
<a id='line_13343'>together and fought long, and at the last Sir Tristram doubled his</a>
<a id='line_13344'>strokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback more than three strides. And</a>
<a id='line_13345'>then by one assent Sir Gaheris and Sir Dinadan went betwixt them, and</a>
<a id='line_13346'>departed them in-sunder. And then by assent of Sir Tristram they would</a>
<a id='line_13347'>have lodged together. But Sir Dinadan would not lodge in that castle.</a>
<a id='line_13348'>And then he cursed the time that ever he came in their fellowship, and</a>
<a id='line_13349'>so he took his horse, and his harness, and departed.</a>
<a id='line_13350'></a>
<a id='line_13351'>Then Sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lend him a man to</a>
<a id='line_13352'>bring him to a lodging, and so they did, and overtook Sir Dinadan, and</a>
<a id='line_13353'>rode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory, and</a>
<a id='line_13354'>there they were well at ease. And that same night Sir Bors and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13355'>Bleoberis, and Sir Ector and Sir Driant, abode still in the same place</a>
<a id='line_13356'>thereas Sir Tristram fought with the thirty knights; and there they met</a>
<a id='line_13357'>with Sir Launcelot the same night, and had made promise to lodge with</a>
<a id='line_13358'>Sir Colgrevance the same night.</a>
<a id='line_13359'></a>
<a id='line_13360'></a>
<a id='line_13361'></a>
<a id='line_13362'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore</a>
<a id='line_13363'>le Desirous, and how Sir Gawaine turned Sir Tristram from Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_13364'>Fay.</a>
<a id='line_13365'></a>
<a id='line_13366'>But anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield of</a>
<a id='line_13367'>Cornwall, then wist he well that it was Sir Tristram that fought with</a>
<a id='line_13368'>his enemies. And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir Tristram, and called</a>
<a id='line_13369'>him the man of most worship in the world. So there was a knight in that</a>
<a id='line_13370'>priory that hight Pellinore, and he desired to wit the name of Sir</a>
<a id='line_13371'>Tristram, but in no wise he could not; and so Sir Tristram departed and</a>
<a id='line_13372'>left Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he was so weary and so sore bruised</a>
<a id='line_13373'>that he might not ride. Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir</a>
<a id='line_13374'>Dinadan: Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight’s name I will ride</a>
<a id='line_13375'>after him and make him to tell me his name, or he shall die therefore.</a>
<a id='line_13376'>Beware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye follow him ye shall</a>
<a id='line_13377'>repent it. So that knight, Sir Pellinore, rode after Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_13378'>required him of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him down and wounded</a>
<a id='line_13379'>him through the shoulder, and so he passed on his way. And on the next</a>
<a id='line_13380'>day following Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and they told him that</a>
<a id='line_13381'>there was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of</a>
<a id='line_13382'>Scotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust against</a>
<a id='line_13383'>other at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all the</a>
<a id='line_13384'>country after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let make</a>
<a id='line_13385'>seeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgalis let seek</a>
<a id='line_13386'>after Sir Tristram de Liones. And at that time Sir Tristram thought to</a>
<a id='line_13387'>be at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the</a>
<a id='line_13388'>Seneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir</a>
<a id='line_13389'>Tristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him, because he</a>
<a id='line_13390'>would not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be</a>
<a id='line_13391'>before the Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him and</a>
<a id='line_13392'>to rest him. And alway Sir Kay cried: Sir knight of Cornwall, joust</a>
<a id='line_13393'>with me, or else yield thee to me as recreant. When Sir Tristram heard</a>
<a id='line_13394'>him say so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay refused him and turned</a>
<a id='line_13395'>his back. Then Sir Tristram said: As I find thee I shall take thee.</a>
<a id='line_13396'>Then Sir Kay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay</a>
<a id='line_13397'>down, and so he rode forth.</a>
<a id='line_13398'></a>
<a id='line_13399'>Then Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him to</a>
<a id='line_13400'>joust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_13401'>Desirous from his horse, and rode his way; and the same day he met with</a>
<a id='line_13402'>a damosel that told him that he should win great worship of a knight</a>
<a id='line_13403'>adventurous that did much harm in all that country. When Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13404'>heard her say so, he was glad to go with her to win worship. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_13405'>Tristram rode with that damosel a six mile, and then met him Sir</a>
<a id='line_13406'>Gawaine, and therewithal Sir Gawaine knew the damosel, that she was a</a>
<a id='line_13407'>damosel of Queen Morgan le Fay. Then Sir Gawaine understood that she</a>
<a id='line_13408'>led that knight to some mischief. Fair knight, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_13409'>whither ride you now with that damosel? Sir, said Sir Tristram, I wot</a>
<a id='line_13410'>not whither I shall ride but as the damosel will lead me. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13411'>Gawaine, ye shall not ride with her, for she and her lady did never</a>
<a id='line_13412'>good, but ill. And then Sir Gawaine pulled out his sword and said:</a>
<a id='line_13413'>Damosel, but if thou tell me anon for what cause thou leadest this</a>
<a id='line_13414'>knight with thee thou shalt die for it right anon: I know all your</a>
<a id='line_13415'>lady’s treason, and yours. Mercy, Sir Gawaine, she said, and if ye will</a>
<a id='line_13416'>save my life I will tell you. Say on, said Sir Gawaine, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_13417'>have thy life. Sir, she said, Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath</a>
<a id='line_13418'>ordained a thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir</a>
<a id='line_13419'>Tristram, and by the trains of these ladies, who that may first meet</a>
<a id='line_13420'>any of these two knights they should turn them unto Morgan le Fay’s</a>
<a id='line_13421'>castle, saying that they should do deeds of worship; and if any of the</a>
<a id='line_13422'>two knights came there, there be thirty knights lying and watching in a</a>
<a id='line_13423'>tower to wait upon Sir Launcelot or upon Sir Tristram. Fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_13424'>said Sir Gawaine, that ever such false treason should be wrought or</a>
<a id='line_13425'>used in a queen, and a king’s sister, and a king and queen’s daughter.</a>

<a id='line_13429'>CHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Gawaine rode to have foughten</a>
<a id='line_13430'>with the thirty knights, but they durst not come out.</a>
<a id='line_13431'></a>
<a id='line_13432'>Sir, said Sir Gawaine, will ye stand with me, and we will see the</a>
<a id='line_13433'>malice of these thirty knights. Sir, said Sir Tristram, go ye to them,</a>
<a id='line_13434'>an it please you, and ye shall see I will not fail you, for it is not</a>
<a id='line_13435'>long ago since I and a fellow met with thirty knights of that queen’s</a>
<a id='line_13436'>fellowship; and God speed us so that we may win worship. So then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13437'>Gawaine and Sir Tristram rode toward the castle where Morgan le Fay</a>
<a id='line_13438'>was, and ever Sir Gawaine deemed well that he was Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_13439'>Liones, because he heard that two knights had slain and beaten thirty</a>
<a id='line_13440'>knights. And when they came afore the castle Sir Gawaine spake on high</a>
<a id='line_13441'>and said: Queen Morgan le Fay, send out your knights that ye have laid</a>
<a id='line_13442'>in a watch for Sir Launcelot and for Sir Tristram. Now, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13443'>Gawaine, I know your false treason, and through all places where that I</a>
<a id='line_13444'>ride men shall know of your false treason; and now let see, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13445'>Gawaine, whether ye dare come out of your castle, ye thirty knights.</a>
<a id='line_13446'>Then the queen spake and all the thirty knights at once, and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_13447'>Gawaine, full well wottest thou what thou dost and sayest; for by God</a>
<a id='line_13448'>we know thee passing well, but all that thou speakest and dost, thou</a>
<a id='line_13449'>sayest it upon pride of that good knight that is there with thee. For</a>
<a id='line_13450'>there be some of us that know full well the hands of that knight over</a>
<a id='line_13451'>all well. And wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, it is more for his sake than</a>
<a id='line_13452'>for thine that we will not come out of this castle. For wit ye well,</a>
<a id='line_13453'>Sir Gawaine, the knight that beareth the arms of Cornwall, we know him</a>
<a id='line_13454'>and what he is.</a>
<a id='line_13455'></a>
<a id='line_13456'>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram departed and rode on their ways a day</a>
<a id='line_13457'>or two together; and there by adventure, they met with Sir Kay and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13458'>Sagramore le Desirous. And then they were glad of Sir Gawaine, and he</a>
<a id='line_13459'>of them, but they wist not what he was with the shield of Cornwall, but</a>
<a id='line_13460'>by deeming. And thus they rode together a day or two. And then they</a>
<a id='line_13461'>were ware of Sir Breuse Saunce Pité chasing a lady for to have slain</a>
<a id='line_13462'>her, for he had slain her paramour afore. Hold you all still, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13463'>Gawaine, and show none of you forth, and ye shall see me reward yonder</a>
<a id='line_13464'>false knight; for an he espy you he is so well horsed that he will</a>
<a id='line_13465'>escape away. And then Sir Gawaine rode betwixt Sir Breuse and the lady,</a>
<a id='line_13466'>and said: False knight, leave her, and have ado with me. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_13467'>Breuse saw no more but Sir Gawaine he feutred his spear, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13468'>Gawaine against him; and there Sir Breuse overthrew Sir Gawaine, and</a>
<a id='line_13469'>then he rode over him, and overthwart him twenty times to have</a>
<a id='line_13470'>destroyed him; and when Sir Tristram saw him do so villainous a deed,</a>
<a id='line_13471'>he hurled out against him. And when Sir Breuse saw him with the shield</a>
<a id='line_13472'>of Cornwall he knew him well that it was Sir Tristram, and then he</a>
<a id='line_13473'>fled, and Sir Tristram followed after him; and Sir Breuse Saunce Pité</a>
<a id='line_13474'>was so horsed that he went his way quite, and Sir Tristram followed him</a>
<a id='line_13475'>long, for he would fain have been avenged upon him. And so when he had</a>
<a id='line_13476'>long chased him, he saw a fair well, and thither he rode to repose him,</a>
<a id='line_13477'>and tied his horse till a tree.</a>

<a id='line_13484'>And then he pulled off his helm and washed his visage and his hands,</a>
<a id='line_13485'>and so he fell asleep. In the meanwhile came a damosel that had sought</a>

<a id='line_13487'>the well she looked upon him, and had forgotten him as in remembrance</a>

<a id='line_13491'>still till he was awake. So when she saw him wake she saluted him, and</a>
<a id='line_13492'>he her again, for either knew other of old acquaintance; then she told</a>
<a id='line_13493'>him how she had sought him long and broad, and there she told him how</a>
<a id='line_13494'>she had letters from Queen La Beale Isoud. Then anon Sir Tristram read</a>
<a id='line_13495'>them, and wit ye well he was glad, for therein was many a piteous</a>
<a id='line_13496'>complaint. Then Sir Tristram said: Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with</a>
<a id='line_13497'>me till that tournament be done at the Castle of Maidens, and then</a>
<a id='line_13498'>shall bear letters and tidings with you. And then Sir Tristram took his</a>
<a id='line_13499'>horse and sought lodging, and there he met with a good ancient knight</a>
<a id='line_13500'>and prayed him to lodge with him. Right so came Gouvernail unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13501'>Tristram, that was glad of that lady. So this old knight’s name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_13502'>Pellounes, and he told of the great tournament that should be at the</a>
<a id='line_13503'>Castle of Maidens. And there Sir Launcelot and thirty-two knights of</a>
<a id='line_13504'>his blood had ordained shields of Cornwall. And right so there came one</a>
<a id='line_13505'>unto Sir Pellounes, and told him that Sir Persides de Bloise was come</a>
<a id='line_13506'>home; then that knight held up his hands and thanked God of his coming</a>
<a id='line_13507'>home. And there Sir Pellounes told Sir Tristram that in two years he</a>
<a id='line_13508'>had not seen his son, Sir Persides. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know your</a>
<a id='line_13509'>son well enough for a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_13510'></a>
<a id='line_13511'>So on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging both</a>
<a id='line_13512'>at once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their clothing.</a>
<a id='line_13513'>And then these two knights each welcomed other. And when Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_13514'>understood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall, he said he was once in</a>
<a id='line_13515'>Cornwall: And there I jousted afore King Mark; and so it happed me at</a>
<a id='line_13516'>that time to overthrow ten knights, and then came to me Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_13517'>Liones and overthrew me, and took my lady away from me, and that shall</a>
<a id='line_13518'>I never forget, but I shall remember me an ever I see my time. Ah, said</a>
<a id='line_13519'>Sir Tristram, now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram. What deem ye,</a>
<a id='line_13520'>ween ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your malice? Yes,</a>
<a id='line_13521'>said Sir Persides, I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble knight and</a>
<a id='line_13522'>a much better knight than I, yet shall I not owe him my good will.</a>
<a id='line_13523'>Right as they stood thus talking at a bay-window of that castle, they</a>
<a id='line_13524'>saw many knights riding to and fro toward the tournament. And then was</a>
<a id='line_13525'>Sir Tristram ware of a likely knight riding upon a great black horse,</a>
<a id='line_13526'>and a black-covered shield. What knight is that, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_13527'>with the black horse and the black shield? he seemeth a good knight. I</a>
<a id='line_13528'>know him well, said Sir Persides, he is one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_13529'>world. Then is it Sir Launcelot, said Tristram. Nay, said Sir Persides,</a>
<a id='line_13530'>it is Sir Palomides, that is yet unchristened.</a>
<a id='line_13531'></a>
<a id='line_13532'></a>
<a id='line_13533'></a>
<a id='line_13534'>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and how</a>
<a id='line_13535'>Launcelot overthrew two knights.</a>
<a id='line_13536'></a>
<a id='line_13537'>Then they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. And</a>
<a id='line_13538'>within a while after there came a squire of the castle, that told Sir</a>
<a id='line_13539'>Pellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight with a black</a>
<a id='line_13540'>shield had smitten down thirteen knights. Fair brother, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13541'>Tristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us cloaks, and let us go</a>
<a id='line_13542'>see the play. Not so, said Sir Persides, we will not go like knaves</a>
<a id='line_13543'>thither, but we will ride like men and good knights to withstand our</a>
<a id='line_13544'>enemies. So they armed them, and took their horses and great spears,</a>
<a id='line_13545'>and thither they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the</a>
<a id='line_13546'>tournament. And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he sent a</a>
<a id='line_13547'>squire unto him and said: Go thou to the yonder knight with the green</a>
<a id='line_13548'>shield and therein a lion of gold, and say him I require him to joust</a>
<a id='line_13549'>with me, and tell him that my name is Sir Palomides. When Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_13550'>understood that request of Sir Palomides, he made him ready, and there</a>
<a id='line_13551'>anon they met together, but Sir Persides had a fall. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13552'>dressed him to be revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_13553'>Palomides that was ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him at</a>
<a id='line_13554'>an advantage and smote him over his horse’s tail when he had no spear</a>
<a id='line_13555'>in his rest. Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his horse lightly, and</a>
<a id='line_13556'>was wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13557'>Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed him to joust</a>
<a id='line_13558'>with him at his request. Nay, said Sir Palomides, as at this time I</a>
<a id='line_13559'>will not joust with that knight, for I know him better than he weeneth.</a>
<a id='line_13560'>And if he be wroth he may right it to-morn at the Castle of Maidens,</a>
<a id='line_13561'>where he may see me and many other knights.</a>
<a id='line_13562'></a>
<a id='line_13563'>With that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he list</a>
<a id='line_13564'>not to jape. Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be a man never</a>
<a id='line_13565'>so good yet may he have a fall, and he was never so wise but he might</a>
<a id='line_13566'>be overseen, and he rideth well that never fell. So Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_13567'>passing wroth, and said to Sir Persides and to Sir Dinadan: I will</a>
<a id='line_13568'>revenge me. Right so as they stood talking there, there came by Sir</a>
<a id='line_13569'>Tristram a likely knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a</a>
<a id='line_13570'>black shield. What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides.</a>
<a id='line_13571'>I know him well, said Sir Persides, for his name is Sir Briant of North</a>
<a id='line_13572'>Wales; so he passed on among other knights of North Wales. And there</a>
<a id='line_13573'>came in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the arms of Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_13574'>and he sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and required him to joust with</a>
<a id='line_13575'>him. Well, said Sir Briant, sithen I am required to joust I will do</a>
<a id='line_13576'>what I may; and there Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his</a>
<a id='line_13577'>horse a great fall. And then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was</a>
<a id='line_13578'>that bare the shield of Cornwall. Whatsoever he be, said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_13579'>warrant you he is of King Ban’s blood, the which be knights of the most</a>
<a id='line_13580'>noble prowess in the world, for to account so many for so many. Then</a>
<a id='line_13581'>there came two knights of Northgalis, that one hight Hew de la</a>
<a id='line_13582'>Montaine, and the other Sir Madok de la Montaine, and they challenged</a>
<a id='line_13583'>Sir Launcelot foot-hot. Sir Launcelot not refusing them but made him</a>
<a id='line_13584'>ready, with one spear he smote them down both over their horses’</a>
<a id='line_13585'>croups; and so Sir Launcelot rode his way. By the good lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13586'>Tristram, he is a good knight that beareth the shield of Cornwall, and</a>
<a id='line_13587'>meseemeth he rideth in the best manner that ever I saw knight ride.</a>
<a id='line_13588'></a>
<a id='line_13589'>Then the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed him</a>
<a id='line_13590'>heartily for his sake to joust with that knight that hath done us of</a>
<a id='line_13591'>Northgalis despite. Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am full loath to have</a>
<a id='line_13592'>ado with that knight, and cause why is, for as to-morn the great</a>
<a id='line_13593'>tournament shall be; and therefore I will keep myself fresh by my will.</a>
<a id='line_13594'>Nay, said the King of Northgalis, I pray you require him of jousts.</a>
<a id='line_13595'>Sir, said Sir Palomides, I will joust at your request, and require that</a>
<a id='line_13596'>knight to joust with me, and often I have seen a man have a fall at his</a>
<a id='line_13597'>own request.</a>
<a id='line_13598'></a>
<a id='line_13599'></a>
<a id='line_13600'></a>
<a id='line_13601'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew</a>
<a id='line_13602'>him, and after he was assailed with twelve knights.</a>
<a id='line_13603'></a>
<a id='line_13604'>Then Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required him</a>
<a id='line_13605'>of jousts. Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, tell me thy lord’s name.</a>
<a id='line_13606'>Sir, said the squire, my lord’s name is Sir Palomides, the good knight.</a>
<a id='line_13607'>In good hour, said Sir Launcelot, for there is no knight that I saw</a>
<a id='line_13608'>this seven years that I had liefer ado withal than with him. And so</a>
<a id='line_13609'>either knights made them ready with two great spears. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13610'>Dinadan, ye shall see that Sir Palomides will quit him right well. It</a>
<a id='line_13611'>may be so, said Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the</a>
<a id='line_13612'>shield of Cornwall shall give him a fall. I believe it not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13613'>Dinadan. Right so they spurred their horses and feutred their spears,</a>
<a id='line_13614'>and either hit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13615'>Launcelot, and he sat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot smote him so</a>
<a id='line_13616'>lightly that he made his horse to avoid the saddle, and the stroke</a>
<a id='line_13617'>brake his shield and the hauberk, and had he not fallen he had been</a>
<a id='line_13618'>slain. How now, said Sir Tristram, I wist well by the manner of their</a>
<a id='line_13619'>riding both that Sir Palomides should have a fall.</a>
<a id='line_13620'></a>
<a id='line_13621'>Right so Sir Launcelot rode his way, and rode to a well to drink and to</a>
<a id='line_13622'>repose him, and they of Northgalis espied him whither he rode; and then</a>
<a id='line_13623'>there followed him twelve knights for to have mischieved him, for this</a>
<a id='line_13624'>cause that upon the morn at the tournament of the Castle of Maidens</a>
<a id='line_13625'>that he should not win the victory. So they came upon Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13626'>suddenly, and unnethe he might put upon him his helm and take his</a>
<a id='line_13627'>horse, but they were in hands with him; and then Sir Launcelot gat his</a>
<a id='line_13628'>spear, and rode through them, and there he slew a knight and brake a</a>
<a id='line_13629'>spear in his body. Then he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand</a>
<a id='line_13630'>and upon the left hand, so that within a few strokes he had slain other</a>
<a id='line_13631'>three knights, and the remnant that abode he wounded them sore all that</a>
<a id='line_13632'>did abide. Thus Sir Launcelot escaped from his enemies of North Wales,</a>
<a id='line_13633'>and then Sir Launcelot rode his way till a friend, and lodged him till</a>
<a id='line_13634'>on the morn; for he would not the first day have ado in the tournament</a>
<a id='line_13635'>because of his great labour. And on the first day he was with King</a>
<a id='line_13636'>Arthur thereas he was set on high upon a scaffold to discern who was</a>
<a id='line_13637'>best worthy of his deeds. So Sir Launcelot was with King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_13638'>jousted not the first day.</a>
<a id='line_13639'></a>
<a id='line_13640'></a>
<a id='line_13641'></a>
<a id='line_13642'>CHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Tristram behaved him the first day of the</a>
<a id='line_13643'>tournament, and there he had the prize.</a>
<a id='line_13644'></a>
<a id='line_13645'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones, that commanded Gouvernail, his</a>
<a id='line_13646'>servant, to ordain him a black shield with none other remembrance</a>
<a id='line_13647'>therein. And so Sir Persides and Sir Tristram departed from their host</a>
<a id='line_13648'>Sir Pellounes, and they rode early toward the tournament, and then they</a>
<a id='line_13649'>drew them to King Carados’ side, of Scotland; and anon knights began</a>
<a id='line_13650'>the field what of King Northgalis’ part, and what of King Carados’</a>
<a id='line_13651'>part, and there began great party. Then there was hurling and rashing.</a>
<a id='line_13652'>Right so came in Sir Persides and Sir Tristram and so they did fare</a>
<a id='line_13653'>that they put the King of Northgalis aback. Then came in Sir Bleoberis</a>
<a id='line_13654'>de Ganis and Sir Gaheris with them of Northgalis, and then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_13655'>Persides smitten down and almost slain, for more than forty horse men</a>
<a id='line_13656'>went over him. For Sir Bleoberis did great deeds of arms, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13657'>Gaheris failed him not. When Sir Tristram beheld them, and saw them do</a>
<a id='line_13658'>such deeds of arms, he marvelled what they were. Also Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13659'>thought shame that Sir Persides was so done to; and then he gat a great</a>
<a id='line_13660'>spear in his hand, and then he rode to Sir Gaheris and smote him down</a>
<a id='line_13661'>from his horse. And then was Sir Bleoberis wroth, and gat a spear and</a>
<a id='line_13662'>rode against Sir Tristram in great ire; and there Sir Tristram met with</a>
<a id='line_13663'>him, and smote Sir Bleoberis from his horse. So then the King with the</a>
<a id='line_13664'>Hundred Knights was wroth, and he horsed Sir Bleoberis and Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_13665'>again, and there began a great medley; and ever Sir Tristram held them</a>
<a id='line_13666'>passing short, and ever Sir Bleoberis was passing busy upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13667'>Tristram; and there came Sir Dinadan against Sir Tristram, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13668'>Tristram gave him such a buffet that he swooned in his saddle. Then</a>
<a id='line_13669'>anon Sir Dinadan came to Sir Tristram and said: Sir, I know thee better</a>
<a id='line_13670'>than thou weenest; but here I promise thee my troth I will never come</a>
<a id='line_13671'>against thee more, for I promise thee that sword of thine shall never</a>
<a id='line_13672'>come on mine helm.</a>
<a id='line_13673'></a>
<a id='line_13674'>With that came Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet</a>
<a id='line_13675'>that down he laid his head; and then he caught him so sore by the helm</a>
<a id='line_13676'>that he pulled him under his horse’s feet. And then King Arthur blew to</a>
<a id='line_13677'>lodging. Then Sir Tristram departed to his pavilion, and Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_13678'>rode with him; and Sir Persides and King Arthur then, and the kings</a>
<a id='line_13679'>upon both parties, marvelled what knight that was with the black</a>
<a id='line_13680'>shield. Many said their advice, and some knew him for Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_13681'>held their peace and would nought say. So that first day King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_13682'>and all the kings and lords that were judges, gave Sir Tristram the</a>
<a id='line_13683'>prize; howbeit they knew him not, but named him the Knight with the</a>
<a id='line_13684'>Black Shield.</a>
<a id='line_13685'></a>
<a id='line_13686'></a>
<a id='line_13687'></a>
<a id='line_13688'>CHAPTER XXX. How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur’s party</a>
<a id='line_13689'>because he saw Sir Palomides on that party.</a>
<a id='line_13690'></a>
<a id='line_13691'>Then upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of Northgalis,</a>
<a id='line_13692'>and rode to King Arthur’s side, where was King Carados, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13693'>Ireland, and Sir Launcelot’s kin, and Sir Gawaine’s kin. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_13694'>Palomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he sent to seek him</a>
<a id='line_13695'>when he was out of his mind in the forest, and this damosel asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_13696'>Tristram what he was and what was his name?</a>
<a id='line_13697'></a>
<a id='line_13698'>As for that, said Sir Tristram, tell Sir Palomides ye shall not wit as</a>
<a id='line_13699'>at this time unto the time I have broken two spears upon him. But let</a>
<a id='line_13700'>him wit thus much, said Sir Tristram, that I am the same knight that he</a>
<a id='line_13701'>smote down in over evening at the tournament; and tell him plainly on</a>
<a id='line_13702'>what party that Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party.</a>
<a id='line_13703'></a>
<a id='line_13704'>Sir, said the damosel, ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will be</a>
<a id='line_13705'>on King Arthur’s side, where the most noble knights of the world be. In</a>
<a id='line_13706'>the name of God, said Sir Tristram, then will I be with the King of</a>
<a id='line_13707'>Northgalis, because Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur’s side, and</a>
<a id='line_13708'>else I would not but for his sake. So when King Arthur was come they</a>
<a id='line_13709'>blew unto the field; and then there began a great party, and so King</a>
<a id='line_13710'>Carados jousted with the King of the Hundred Knights, and there King</a>
<a id='line_13711'>Carados had a fall: then was there hurling and rushing, and right so</a>
<a id='line_13712'>came in knights of King Arthur’s, and they bare aback the King of</a>
<a id='line_13713'>Northgalis’ knights.</a>
<a id='line_13714'></a>
<a id='line_13715'>Then Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that there</a>
<a id='line_13716'>was none might withstand him, and thus Sir Tristram dured long. And at</a>
<a id='line_13717'>the last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban, and there</a>
<a id='line_13718'>fell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13719'>Blamore de Ganis, and many other knights. And then Sir Tristram smote</a>
<a id='line_13720'>on the right hand and on the left hand, that all lords and ladies spake</a>
<a id='line_13721'>of his noble deeds. But at the last Sir Tristram should have had the</a>
<a id='line_13722'>worse had not the King with the Hundred Knights been. And then he came</a>
<a id='line_13723'>with his fellowship and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him away from</a>
<a id='line_13724'>those knights that bare the shields of Cornwall. And then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13725'>saw another fellowship by themself, and there were a forty knights</a>
<a id='line_13726'>together, and Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their governor. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13727'>Tristram rode in amongst them, and there he smote down Sir Kay from his</a>
<a id='line_13728'>horse; and there he fared among those knights like a greyhound among</a>
<a id='line_13729'>conies.</a>
<a id='line_13730'></a>
<a id='line_13731'>Then Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the head.</a>
<a id='line_13732'>Sir, said Sir Launcelot, who wounded you so sore? Sir, he said, a</a>
<a id='line_13733'>knight that beareth a black shield, and I may curse the time that ever</a>
<a id='line_13734'>I met with him, for he is a devil and no man. So Sir Launcelot departed</a>
<a id='line_13735'>from him and thought to meet with Sir Tristram, and so he rode with his</a>
<a id='line_13736'>sword drawn in his hand to seek Sir Tristram; and then he espied him</a>
<a id='line_13737'>how he hurled here and there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh</a>
<a id='line_13738'>smote down a knight. O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare</a>
<a id='line_13739'>arms saw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms. And if I</a>
<a id='line_13740'>should set upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did shame</a>
<a id='line_13741'>to myself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his sword. And then the</a>
<a id='line_13742'>King with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of North Wales set</a>
<a id='line_13743'>upon the twenty of Sir Launcelot’s kin: and they twenty knights held</a>
<a id='line_13744'>them ever together as wild swine, and none would fail other. And so</a>
<a id='line_13745'>when Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse of these twenty knights he</a>
<a id='line_13746'>marvelled of their good deeds, for he saw by their fare and by their</a>
<a id='line_13747'>rule that they had liefer die than avoid the field. Now Jesu, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13748'>Tristram, well may he be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a</a>
<a id='line_13749'>sort of noble knights unto his kin, and full like is he to be a noble</a>
<a id='line_13750'>man that is their leader and governor. He meant it by Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_13751'>Lake. So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he thought shame to</a>
<a id='line_13752'>see two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13753'>Tristram rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and said: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_13754'>leave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye win no worship of</a>
<a id='line_13755'>them, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye well they will not out</a>
<a id='line_13756'>of the field I see by their cheer and countenance; and worship get ye</a>
<a id='line_13757'>none an ye slay them. Therefore leave your fighting with them, for I to</a>
<a id='line_13758'>increase my worship I will ride to the twenty knights and help them</a>
<a id='line_13759'>with all my might and power. Nay, said the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_13760'>Knights, ye shall not do so; now I see your courage and courtesy I will</a>
<a id='line_13761'>withdraw my knights for your pleasure, for evermore a good knight will</a>
<a id='line_13762'>favour another, and like will draw to like.</a>
<a id='line_13763'></a>
<a id='line_13764'></a>
<a id='line_13765'></a>
<a id='line_13766'>CHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought</a>
<a id='line_13767'>him with him to his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_13768'></a>
<a id='line_13769'>Then the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his knights. And all</a>
<a id='line_13770'>this while, and long to-fore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13771'>Tristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him. And then</a>
<a id='line_13772'>suddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode their</a>
<a id='line_13773'>way into the forest, that no man perceived where they went. So then</a>
<a id='line_13774'>King Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the King of Northgalis the</a>
<a id='line_13775'>prize because Sir Tristram was upon his side. Then Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_13776'>here and there, so wood as lion that fauted his fill, because he had</a>
<a id='line_13777'>lost Sir Tristram, and so he returned unto King Arthur. And then in all</a>
<a id='line_13778'>the field was a noise that with the wind it might be heard two mile</a>
<a id='line_13779'>thence, how the lords and ladies cried: The Knight with the Black</a>
<a id='line_13780'>Shield hath won the field. Alas, said King Arthur, where is that knight</a>
<a id='line_13781'>become? It is shame to all those in the field so to let him escape away</a>
<a id='line_13782'>from you; but with gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him</a>
<a id='line_13783'>unto me to the Castle of Maidens. Then the noble King Arthur went unto</a>
<a id='line_13784'>his knights and comforted them in the best wise that he could, and</a>
<a id='line_13785'>said: My fair fellows, be not dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field</a>
<a id='line_13786'>this day. And many were hurt and sore wounded, and many were whole. My</a>
<a id='line_13787'>fellows, said King Arthur, look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn I</a>
<a id='line_13788'>will be in the field with you and revenge you of your enemies. So that</a>
<a id='line_13789'>night King Arthur and his knights reposed themself.</a>
<a id='line_13790'></a>
<a id='line_13791'>The damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all the</a>
<a id='line_13792'>while the tournament was a-doing she was with Queen Guenever, and ever</a>
<a id='line_13793'>the queen asked her for what cause she came into that country. Madam,</a>
<a id='line_13794'>she answered, I come for none other cause but from my lady La Beale</a>
<a id='line_13795'>Isoud to wit of your welfare. For in no wise she would not tell the</a>
<a id='line_13796'>queen that she came for Sir Tristram’s sake. So this lady, Dame</a>
<a id='line_13797'>Bragwaine, took her leave of Queen Guenever, and she rode after Sir</a>
<a id='line_13798'>Tristram. And as she rode through the forest she heard a great cry;</a>
<a id='line_13799'>then she commanded her squire to go into the forest to wit what was</a>
<a id='line_13800'>that noise. And so he came to a well, and there he found a knight</a>
<a id='line_13801'>bounden till a tree crying as he had been wood, and his horse and his</a>
<a id='line_13802'>harness standing by him. And when he espied that squire, therewith he</a>
<a id='line_13803'>abraid and brake himself loose, and took his sword in his hand, and ran</a>
<a id='line_13804'>to have slain the squire. Then he took his horse and fled all that ever</a>
<a id='line_13805'>he might unto Dame Bragwaine, and told her of his adventure. Then she</a>
<a id='line_13806'>rode unto Sir Tristram’s pavilion, and told Sir Tristram what adventure</a>
<a id='line_13807'>she had found in the forest. Alas, said Sir Tristram, upon my head</a>
<a id='line_13808'>there is some good knight at mischief.</a>
<a id='line_13809'></a>
<a id='line_13810'>Then Sir Tristram took his horse and his sword and rode thither, and</a>
<a id='line_13811'>there he heard how the knight complained unto himself and said: I,</a>
<a id='line_13812'>woful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth me, that thus</a>
<a id='line_13813'>am defoiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir Bors and Sir Ector.</a>
<a id='line_13814'>Alas, he said, why live I so long! And then he gat his sword in his</a>
<a id='line_13815'>hands, and made many strange signs and tokens; and so through his</a>
<a id='line_13816'>raging he threw his sword into that fountain. Then Sir Palomides wailed</a>
<a id='line_13817'>and wrang his hands. And at the last for pure sorrow he ran into that</a>
<a id='line_13818'>fountain, over his belly, and sought after his sword. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13819'>saw that, and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him in his arms fast.</a>
<a id='line_13820'>What art thou, said Palomides, that holdeth me so? I am a man of this</a>
<a id='line_13821'>forest that would thee none harm. Alas, said Sir Palomides, I may never</a>
<a id='line_13822'>win worship where Sir Tristram is; for ever where he is an I be there,</a>
<a id='line_13823'>then get I no worship; and if he be away for the most part I have the</a>
<a id='line_13824'>gree, unless that Sir Launcelot be there or Sir Lamorak. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13825'>Palomides said: Once in Ireland Sir Tristram put me to the worse, and</a>
<a id='line_13826'>another time in Cornwall, and in other places in this land. What would</a>
<a id='line_13827'>ye do, said Sir Tristram, an ye had Sir Tristram? I would fight with</a>
<a id='line_13828'>him, said Sir Palomides, and ease my heart upon him; and yet, to say</a>
<a id='line_13829'>thee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in this world living.</a>
<a id='line_13830'>What will ye do, said Sir Tristram, will ye go with me to your lodging?</a>
<a id='line_13831'>Nay, said he, I will go to the King with the Hundred Knights, for he</a>
<a id='line_13832'>rescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector and else had I been</a>
<a id='line_13833'>slain traitorly. Sir Tristram said him such kind words that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13834'>Palomides went with him to his lodging. Then Gouvernail went to-fore,</a>
<a id='line_13835'>and charged Dame Bragwaine to go out of the way to her lodging. And bid</a>
<a id='line_13836'>ye Sir Persides that he make him no quarrels. And so they rode together</a>
<a id='line_13837'>till they came to Sir Tristram’s pavilion, and there Sir Palomides had</a>
<a id='line_13838'>all the cheer that might be had all that night. But in no wise Sir</a>
<a id='line_13839'>Palomides might not know what was Sir Tristram; and so after supper</a>
<a id='line_13840'>they yede to rest, and Sir Tristram for great travail slept till it was</a>
<a id='line_13841'>day. And Sir Palomides might not sleep for anguish; and in the dawning</a>
<a id='line_13842'>of the day he took his horse privily, and rode his way unto Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_13843'>and unto Sir Sagramore le Desirous, where they were in their pavilions;</a>
<a id='line_13844'>for they three were fellows at the beginning of the tournament. And</a>
<a id='line_13845'>then upon the morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third</a>
<a id='line_13846'>day.</a>
<a id='line_13847'></a>
<a id='line_13848'></a>
<a id='line_13849'></a>
<a id='line_13850'>CHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he</a>
<a id='line_13851'>jousted with King Arthur, and other feats.</a>
<a id='line_13852'></a>
<a id='line_13853'>So the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights, they</a>
<a id='line_13854'>two encountered with King Carados and with the King of Ireland; and</a>
<a id='line_13855'>there the King with the Hundred Knights smote down King Carados, and</a>
<a id='line_13856'>the King of Northgalis smote down the King of Ireland. With that came</a>
<a id='line_13857'>in Sir Palomides, and when he came he made great work, for by his</a>
<a id='line_13858'>indented shield he was well known. So came in King Arthur, and did</a>
<a id='line_13859'>great deeds of arms together, and put the King of Northgalis and the</a>
<a id='line_13860'>King with the Hundred Knights to the worse. With this came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_13861'>Tristram with his black shield, and anon he jousted with Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_13862'>and there by fine force Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides over his</a>
<a id='line_13863'>horse’s croup. Then King Arthur cried: Knight with the Black Shield,</a>
<a id='line_13864'>make thee ready to me, and in the same wise Sir Tristram smote King</a>
<a id='line_13865'>Arthur. And then by force of King Arthur’s knights the King and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13866'>Palomides were horsed again. Then King Arthur with a great eager heart</a>
<a id='line_13867'>he gat a spear in his hand, and there upon the one side he smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_13868'>Tristram over his horse. Then foot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_13869'>Tristram, as he was upon foot, to have overridden him. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13870'>Tristram was ware of him, and there he stooped aside, and with great</a>
<a id='line_13871'>ire he gat him by the arm, and pulled him down from his horse. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13872'>Palomides lightly arose, and then they dashed together mightily with</a>
<a id='line_13873'>their swords; and many kings, queens, and lords, stood and beheld them.</a>
<a id='line_13874'>And at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides upon the helm three</a>
<a id='line_13875'>mighty strokes, and at every stroke that he gave him he said: This for</a>
<a id='line_13876'>Sir Tristram’s sake. With that Sir Palomides fell to the earth</a>
<a id='line_13877'>grovelling.</a>
<a id='line_13878'></a>
<a id='line_13879'>Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13880'>an horse, and so was he horsed again. By then was Sir Palomides horsed,</a>
<a id='line_13881'>and with great ire he jousted upon Sir Tristram with his spear as it</a>
<a id='line_13882'>was in the rest, and gave him a great dash with his sword. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13883'>Tristram avoided his spear, and gat him by the neck with his both</a>
<a id='line_13884'>hands, and pulled him clean out of his saddle, and so he bare him afore</a>
<a id='line_13885'>him the length of ten spears, and then in the presence of them all he</a>
<a id='line_13886'>let him fall at his adventure. Then Sir Tristram was ware of King</a>
<a id='line_13887'>Arthur with a naked sword in his hand, and with his spear Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13888'>ran upon King Arthur; and then King Arthur boldly abode him and with</a>
<a id='line_13889'>his sword he smote a-two his spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_13890'>stonied; and so King Arthur gave him three or four strokes or he might</a>
<a id='line_13891'>get out his sword, and at the last Sir Tristram drew his sword and</a>
<a id='line_13892'>[either] assailed other passing hard. With that the great press</a>
<a id='line_13893'>departed [them]. Then Sir Tristram rode here and there and did his</a>
<a id='line_13894'>great pain, that eleven of the good knights of the blood of King Ban,</a>
<a id='line_13895'>that was of Sir Launcelot’s kin, that day Sir Tristram smote down; that</a>
<a id='line_13896'>all the estates marvelled of his great deeds and all cried upon the</a>
<a id='line_13897'>Knight with the Black Shield.</a>
<a id='line_13898'></a>
<a id='line_13899'></a>
<a id='line_13900'></a>
<a id='line_13901'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after Sir</a>
<a id='line_13902'>Tristram smote down Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_13903'></a>
<a id='line_13904'>Then this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it. And then he gat</a>
<a id='line_13905'>a great spear in his hand and came towards the cry. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13906'>cried: The Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to joust with</a>
<a id='line_13907'>me. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he gat his spear in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_13908'>and either abashed down their heads, and came together as thunder; and</a>
<a id='line_13909'>Sir Tristram’s spear brake in pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune</a>
<a id='line_13910'>struck Sir Tristram on the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet</a>
<a id='line_13911'>Sir Tristram avoided not his saddle, and so the spear brake.</a>
<a id='line_13912'>Therewithal Sir Tristram that was wounded gat out his sword, and he</a>
<a id='line_13913'>rushed to Sir Launcelot, and gave him three great strokes upon the helm</a>
<a id='line_13914'>that the fire sprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his head lowly</a>
<a id='line_13915'>toward his saddle-bow. And therewithal Sir Tristram departed from the</a>
<a id='line_13916'>field, for he felt him so wounded that he weened he should have died;</a>
<a id='line_13917'>and Sir Dinadan espied him and followed him into the forest. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13918'>Launcelot abode and did many marvellous deeds.</a>
<a id='line_13919'></a>
<a id='line_13920'>So when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest’s side he alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_13921'>unlaced his harness and freshed his wound; then weened Sir Dinadan that</a>
<a id='line_13922'>he should have died. Nay, nay, said Sir Tristram, Dinadan never dread</a>
<a id='line_13923'>thee, for I am heart-whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by</a>
<a id='line_13924'>the mercy of God. By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides</a>
<a id='line_13925'>riding straight upon them. And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13926'>Palomides came to have destroyed him. And so Sir Dinadan gave him</a>
<a id='line_13927'>warning, and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that</a>
<a id='line_13928'>ye may not have ado with him, therefore I will ride against him and do</a>
<a id='line_13929'>to him what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul; and in</a>
<a id='line_13930'>the meanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle, or in the</a>
<a id='line_13931'>forest, that he shall not meet with you. Sir Tristram smiled and said:</a>
<a id='line_13932'>I thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good will, but ye shall wit that I am</a>
<a id='line_13933'>able to handle him. And then anon hastily he armed him, and took his</a>
<a id='line_13934'>horse, and a great spear in his hand, and said to Sir Dinadan: Adieu;</a>
<a id='line_13935'>and rode toward Sir Palomides a soft pace. Then when Sir Palomides saw</a>
<a id='line_13936'>that, he made countenance to amend his horse, but he did it for this</a>
<a id='line_13937'>cause, for he abode Sir Gaheris that came after him. And when he was</a>
<a id='line_13938'>come he rode toward Sir Tristram. Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13939'>Palomides, and required him to joust with him; and if he smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_13940'>Palomides he would do no more to him; and if it so happened that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13941'>Palomides smote down Sir Tristram, he bade him do his utterance. So</a>
<a id='line_13942'>they were accorded. Then they met together, and Sir Tristram smote down</a>
<a id='line_13943'>Sir Palomides that he had a grievous fall, so that he lay still as he</a>
<a id='line_13944'>had been dead. And then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he would</a>
<a id='line_13945'>not have jousted; but whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote him</a>
<a id='line_13946'>over his horse’s croup, that he lay still as though he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_13947'>And then Sir Tristram rode his way and left Sir Persides’ squire within</a>
<a id='line_13948'>the pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old knight’s</a>
<a id='line_13949'>place to lodge them. And that old knight had five sons at the</a>
<a id='line_13950'>tournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their coming home. And</a>
<a id='line_13951'>so, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten.</a>
<a id='line_13952'></a>
<a id='line_13953'>And when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir Launcelot held alway</a>
<a id='line_13954'>the stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself, and</a>
<a id='line_13955'>wit ye well there was many a noble knight against him. And when King</a>
<a id='line_13956'>Arthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous deeds of arms he then armed</a>
<a id='line_13957'>him, and took his horse and his armour, and rode into the field to help</a>
<a id='line_13958'>Sir Launcelot; and so many knights came in with King Arthur. And to</a>
<a id='line_13959'>make short tale in conclusion, the King of Northgalis and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13960'>the Hundred Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13961'>abode and was the last in the field the prize was given him. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_13962'>Launcelot would neither for king, queen, nor knight, have the prize,</a>
<a id='line_13963'>but where the cry was cried through the field: Sir Launcelot, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13964'>Launcelot hath won the field this day, Sir Launcelot let make another</a>
<a id='line_13965'>cry contrary: Sir Tristram hath won the field, for he began first, and</a>
<a id='line_13966'>last he hath endured, and so hath he done the first day, the second,</a>
<a id='line_13967'>and the third day.</a>

<a id='line_13969'></a>
<a id='line_13970'></a>
<a id='line_13971'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How the prize of the third day was given to Sir</a>
<a id='line_13972'>Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot gave it to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_13973'></a>
<a id='line_13974'>Then all the estates and degrees high and low said of Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13975'>great worship, for the honour that he did unto Sir Tristram; and for</a>
<a id='line_13976'>that honour doing to Sir Tristram he was at that time more praised and</a>
<a id='line_13977'>renowned than an he had overthrown five hundred knights; and all the</a>
<a id='line_13978'>people wholly for this gentleness, first the estates both high and low,</a>
<a id='line_13979'>and after the commonalty cried at once: Sir Launcelot hath won the</a>
<a id='line_13980'>field whosoever say nay. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth and ashamed, and</a>
<a id='line_13981'>so therewithal he rode to King Arthur. Alas, said the king, we are all</a>
<a id='line_13982'>dismayed that Sir Tristram is thus departed from us. By God, said King</a>
<a id='line_13983'>Arthur, he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw hold spear or</a>
<a id='line_13984'>sword in hand, and the most courteoust knight in his fighting; for full</a>
<a id='line_13985'>hard I saw him, said King Arthur, when he smote Sir Palomides upon the</a>
<a id='line_13986'>helm thrice, that he abashed his helm with his strokes, and also he</a>
<a id='line_13987'>said: Here is a stroke for Sir Tristram, and thus thrice he said. Then</a>
<a id='line_13988'>King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Dodinas le Savage took their horses</a>
<a id='line_13989'>to seek Sir Tristram, and by the means of Sir Persides he had told King</a>
<a id='line_13990'>Arthur where Sir Tristram was in his pavilion. But when they came</a>
<a id='line_13991'>there, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan were gone.</a>
<a id='line_13992'></a>
<a id='line_13993'>Then King Arthur and Sir Launcelot were heavy, and returned again to</a>
<a id='line_13994'>the Castle of Maidens making great dole for the hurt of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_13995'>and his sudden departing. So God me help, said King Arthur, I am more</a>
<a id='line_13996'>heavy that I cannot meet with him than for all the hurts that all my</a>
<a id='line_13997'>knights have had at the tournament. Right so came Sir Gaheris and told</a>
<a id='line_13998'>King Arthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was</a>
<a id='line_13999'>at Sir Palomides’ own request. Alas, said King Arthur, that was great</a>
<a id='line_14000'>dishonour to Sir Palomides, inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded,</a>
<a id='line_14001'>and now may we all, kings, and knights, and men of worship, say that</a>
<a id='line_14002'>Sir Tristram may be called a noble knight, and one of the best knights</a>
<a id='line_14003'>that ever I saw the days of my life. For I will that ye all, kings and</a>
<a id='line_14004'>knights, know, said King Arthur, that I never saw knight do so</a>
<a id='line_14005'>marvellously as he hath done these three days; for he was the first</a>
<a id='line_14006'>that began and that longest held on, save this last day. And though he</a>
<a id='line_14007'>was hurt, it was a manly adventure of two noble knights, and when two</a>
<a id='line_14008'>noble men encounter needs must the one have the worse, like as God will</a>
<a id='line_14009'>suffer at that time. As for me, said Sir Launcelot, for all the lands</a>
<a id='line_14010'>that ever my father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an I had</a>
<a id='line_14011'>known him at that time; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield.</a>
<a id='line_14012'>For an I had seen his black shield, I would not have meddled with him</a>
<a id='line_14013'>for many causes; for late he did as much for me as ever did knight, and</a>
<a id='line_14014'>that is well known that he had ado with thirty knights, and no help</a>
<a id='line_14015'>save Sir Dinadan. And one thing shall I promise, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14016'>Sir Palomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow</a>
<a id='line_14017'>that noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus. Sir Launcelot said all</a>
<a id='line_14018'>the worship that might be said by Sir Tristram. Then King Arthur made a</a>
<a id='line_14019'>great feast to all that would come. And thus we let pass King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_14020'>and a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides, that after he had a fall</a>
<a id='line_14021'>of Sir Tristram, he was nigh-hand araged out of his wit for despite of</a>
<a id='line_14022'>Sir Tristram. And so he followed him by adventure. And as he came by a</a>
<a id='line_14023'>river, in his woodness he would have made his horse to have leapt over;</a>
<a id='line_14024'>and the horse failed footing and fell in the river, wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_14025'>Palomides was adread lest he should have been drowned; and then he</a>
<a id='line_14026'>avoided his horse, and swam to the land, and let his horse go down by</a>
<a id='line_14027'>adventure.</a>
<a id='line_14028'></a>
<a id='line_14029'></a>
<a id='line_14030'></a>
<a id='line_14031'>CHAPTER XXXV. How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was,</a>
<a id='line_14032'>and of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir</a>
<a id='line_14033'>Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14034'></a>
<a id='line_14035'>And when he came to the land he took off his harness, and sat roaring</a>
<a id='line_14036'>and crying as a man out of his mind. Right so came a damosel even by</a>
<a id='line_14037'>Sir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and his brother unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_14038'>Mordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir</a>
<a id='line_14039'>Tristram was. For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir</a>
<a id='line_14040'>Mordred a ten days afore; and had it not been for the love of Sir</a>
<a id='line_14041'>Gawaine and his brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred. And so</a>
<a id='line_14042'>this damosel came by Sir Palomides, and she and he had language</a>
<a id='line_14043'>together, the which pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode</a>
<a id='line_14044'>her ways till she came to the old knight’s place, and there she told</a>
<a id='line_14045'>that old knight how she met with the woodest knight by adventure that</a>
<a id='line_14046'>ever she met withal. What bare he in his shield? said Sir Tristram. It</a>
<a id='line_14047'>was indented with white and black, said the damosel. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14048'>Tristram, that was Sir Palomides, the good knight. For well I know him,</a>
<a id='line_14049'>said Sir Tristram, for one of the best knights living in this realm.</a>
<a id='line_14050'>Then that old knight took a little hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_14051'>and brought him unto his own manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir</a>
<a id='line_14052'>Palomides, but he said but little, for at that time Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_14053'>walking upon his feet, and well amended of his hurts; and always when</a>
<a id='line_14054'>Sir Palomides saw Sir Tristram he would behold him full marvellously,</a>
<a id='line_14055'>and ever him seemed that he had seen him. Then would he say unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_14056'>Dinadan: An ever I may meet with Sir Tristram he shall not escape mine</a>
<a id='line_14057'>hands. I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, that ye boast behind Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14058'>for it is but late that he was in your hands, and ye in his hands; why</a>
<a id='line_14059'>would ye not hold him when ye had him? for I saw myself twice or thrice</a>
<a id='line_14060'>that ye gat but little worship of Sir Tristram. Then was Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_14061'>ashamed. So leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old</a>
<a id='line_14062'>knight Sir Darras.</a>
<a id='line_14063'></a>
<a id='line_14064'>Now shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot: Had not</a>
<a id='line_14065'>ye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he was here daily unto the</a>
<a id='line_14066'>time ye met with him, and in an evil time, said Arthur, ye encountered</a>
<a id='line_14067'>with him. My lord Arthur, said Launcelot, ye put upon me that I should</a>
<a id='line_14068'>be cause of his departition; God knoweth it was against my will. But</a>
<a id='line_14069'>when men be hot in deeds of arms oft they hurt their friends as well as</a>
<a id='line_14070'>their foes. And my lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall understand that</a>
<a id='line_14071'>Sir Tristram is a man that I am loath to offend, for he hath done for</a>
<a id='line_14072'>me more than ever I did for him as yet. But then Sir Launcelot made</a>
<a id='line_14073'>bring forth a book: and then Sir Launcelot said: Here we are ten</a>
<a id='line_14074'>knights that will swear upon a book never to rest one night where we</a>
<a id='line_14075'>rest another this twelvemonth until that we find Sir Tristram. And as</a>
<a id='line_14076'>for me, said Sir Launcelot, I promise you upon this book that an I may</a>
<a id='line_14077'>meet with him, either with fairness or foulness I shall bring him to</a>
<a id='line_14078'>this court, or else I shall die therefore. And the names of these ten</a>
<a id='line_14079'>knights that had undertaken this quest were these following: First was</a>
<a id='line_14080'>Sir Launcelot, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Bleoberis,</a>
<a id='line_14081'>and Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Lucan the Butler, Sir Uwaine, Sir Galihud</a>
<a id='line_14082'>Lionel, and Galiodin. So these ten noble knights departed from the</a>
<a id='line_14083'>court of King Arthur, and so they rode upon their quest together until</a>
<a id='line_14084'>they came to a cross where departed four ways, and there departed the</a>
<a id='line_14085'>fellowship in four to seek Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14086'></a>
<a id='line_14087'>And as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he met with Dame Bragwaine that</a>
<a id='line_14088'>was sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she fled as fast</a>
<a id='line_14089'>as her palfrey might go. So Sir Launcelot met with her and asked her</a>
<a id='line_14090'>why she fled. Ah, fair knight, said Dame Bragwaine, I flee for dread of</a>
<a id='line_14091'>my life, for here followeth me Sir Breuse Saunce Pité to slay me. Hold</a>
<a id='line_14092'>you nigh me, said Sir Launcelot. Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breuse</a>
<a id='line_14093'>Saunce Pité, Sir Launcelot cried unto him, and said: False knight,</a>
<a id='line_14094'>destroyer of ladies and damosels, now thy last days be come. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_14095'>Breuse Saunce Pité saw Sir Launcelot’s shield he knew it well, for at</a>
<a id='line_14096'>that time he bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he bare his own shield.</a>
<a id='line_14097'>And then Sir Breuse fled, and Sir Launcelot followed after him. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_14098'>Breuse was so well horsed that when him list to flee he might well</a>
<a id='line_14099'>flee, and also abide when him list. And then Sir Launcelot returned</a>
<a id='line_14100'>unto Dame Bragwaine, and she thanked him of his great labour.</a>
<a id='line_14101'></a>
<a id='line_14102'></a>
<a id='line_14103'></a>
<a id='line_14104'>CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan were</a>
<a id='line_14105'>taken and put in prison.</a>
<a id='line_14106'></a>
<a id='line_14107'>Now will we speak of Sir Lucan the butler, that by fortune he came</a>
<a id='line_14108'>riding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he came in</a>
<a id='line_14109'>none other intent but to ask harbour. Then the porter asked what was</a>
<a id='line_14110'>his name. Tell your lord that my name is Sir Lucan, the butler, a</a>
<a id='line_14111'>Knight of the Round Table. So the porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of</a>
<a id='line_14112'>the place, and told him who was there to ask harbour. Nay, nay, said</a>
<a id='line_14113'>Sir Daname, that was nephew to Sir Darras, say him that he shall not be</a>
<a id='line_14114'>lodged here, but let him wit that I, Sir Daname, will meet with him</a>
<a id='line_14115'>anon, and bid him make him ready. So Sir Daname came forth on</a>
<a id='line_14116'>horseback, and there they met together with spears, and Sir Lucan smote</a>
<a id='line_14117'>down Sir Daname over his horse’s croup, and then he fled into that</a>
<a id='line_14118'>place, and Sir Lucan rode after him, and asked after him many times.</a>
<a id='line_14119'></a>
<a id='line_14120'>Then Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram: It is shame to see the lord’s</a>
<a id='line_14121'>cousin of this place defoiled. Abide, said Sir Tristram, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_14122'>redress it. And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on horseback, and he</a>
<a id='line_14123'>jousted with Lucan the butler, and there Sir Lucan smote Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_14124'>through the thick of the thigh, and so he rode his way; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14125'>Tristram was wroth that Sir Dinadan was hurt, and followed after, and</a>
<a id='line_14126'>thought to avenge him; and within a while he overtook Sir Lucan, and</a>
<a id='line_14127'>bade him turn; and so they met together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir</a>
<a id='line_14128'>Lucan passing sore and gave him a fall. With that came Sir Uwaine, a</a>
<a id='line_14129'>gentle knight, and when he saw Sir Lucan so hurt he called Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14130'>to joust with him. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name I</a>
<a id='line_14131'>require you. Sir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwaine le Fise de</a>
<a id='line_14132'>Roy Ureine. Ah, said Sir Tristram, by my will I would not have ado with</a>
<a id='line_14133'>you at no time. Ye shall not so, said Sir Uwaine, but ye shall have ado</a>
<a id='line_14134'>with me. And then Sir Tristram saw none other bote, but rode against</a>
<a id='line_14135'>him, and overthrew Sir Uwaine and hurt him in the side, and so he</a>
<a id='line_14136'>departed unto his lodging again. And when Sir Dinadan understood that</a>
<a id='line_14137'>Sir Tristram had hurt Sir Lucan he would have ridden after Sir Lucan</a>
<a id='line_14138'>for to have slain him, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14139'>Uwaine let ordain an horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to the abbey</a>
<a id='line_14140'>of Ganis, and the castle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis, of the</a>
<a id='line_14141'>which Sir Bleoberis was lord. And at that castle Sir Launcelot promised</a>
<a id='line_14142'>all his fellows to meet in the quest of Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14143'></a>
<a id='line_14144'>So when Sir Tristram was come to his lodging there came a damosel that</a>
<a id='line_14145'>told Sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that tournament,</a>
<a id='line_14146'>and two grievously wounded that they were never like to help themself.</a>
<a id='line_14147'>And all this was done by a noble knight that bare the black shield, and</a>
<a id='line_14148'>that was he that bare the prize. Then came there one and told Sir</a>
<a id='line_14149'>Darras that the same knight was within, him that bare the black shield.</a>
<a id='line_14150'>Then Sir Darras yede unto Sir Tristram’s chamber, and there he found</a>
<a id='line_14151'>his shield and showed it to the damosel. Ah sir, said the damosel, that</a>
<a id='line_14152'>same is he that slew your three sons. Then without any tarrying Sir</a>
<a id='line_14153'>Darras put Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan, within a</a>
<a id='line_14154'>strong prison, and there Sir Tristram was like to have died of great</a>
<a id='line_14155'>sickness; and every day Sir Palomides would reprove Sir Tristram of old</a>
<a id='line_14156'>hate betwixt them. And ever Sir Tristram spake fair and said little.</a>
<a id='line_14157'>But when Sir Palomides saw the falling of sickness of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14158'>then was he heavy for him, and comforted him in all the best wise he</a>
<a id='line_14159'>could. And as the French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir</a>
<a id='line_14160'>Darras that were of his own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14161'>and his two fellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept</a>
<a id='line_14162'>them in prison, and meat and drink they had. So Sir Tristram endured</a>
<a id='line_14163'>there great pain, for sickness had undertaken him, and that is the</a>
<a id='line_14164'>greatest pain a prisoner may have. For all the while a prisoner may</a>
<a id='line_14165'>have his health of body he may endure under the mercy of God and in</a>
<a id='line_14166'>hope of good deliverance; but when sickness toucheth a prisoner’s body,</a>
<a id='line_14167'>then may a prisoner say all wealth is him bereft, and then he hath</a>
<a id='line_14168'>cause to wail and to weep. Right so did Sir Tristram when sickness had</a>
<a id='line_14169'>undertaken him, for then he took such sorrow that he had almost slain</a>
<a id='line_14170'>himself.</a>
<a id='line_14171'></a>
<a id='line_14172'></a>
<a id='line_14173'></a>
<a id='line_14174'>CHAPTER XXXVII. How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of Sir</a>
<a id='line_14175'>Tristram. Some of King Arthur’s knights jousted with knights of</a>
<a id='line_14176'>Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_14177'></a>
<a id='line_14178'>Now will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14179'>Dinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought after Sir</a>
<a id='line_14180'>Tristram many divers parts of this land. And some yede into Cornwall;</a>
<a id='line_14181'>and by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King Arthur, came unto King</a>
<a id='line_14182'>Mark, and there he was well received and sat at King Mark’s own table</a>
<a id='line_14183'>and ate of his own mess. Then King Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings</a>
<a id='line_14184'>there were in the realm of Logris. Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king</a>
<a id='line_14185'>reigneth as a noble knight; and now but late there was a great jousts</a>
<a id='line_14186'>and tournament as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most</a>
<a id='line_14187'>noble knights were at that jousts. But there was one knight that did</a>
<a id='line_14188'>marvellously three days, and he bare a black shield, and of all knights</a>
<a id='line_14189'>that ever I saw he proved the best knight. Then, said King Mark, that</a>
<a id='line_14190'>was Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14191'>Gheris, for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides were on the contrary</a>
<a id='line_14192'>party against the Knight with the Black Shield. Then was it Sir</a>
<a id='line_14193'>Tristram, said the king. Yea, said Sir Gaheris. And therewithal the</a>
<a id='line_14194'>king smote down his head, and in his heart he feared sore that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14195'>Tristram should get him such worship in the realm of Logris</a>
<a id='line_14196'>wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him. Thus</a>
<a id='line_14197'>Sir Gaheris had great cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La Beale</a>
<a id='line_14198'>Isoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris’ words; for well she wist by</a>
<a id='line_14199'>his deeds and manners that it was Sir Tristram. And then the king made</a>
<a id='line_14200'>a feast royal, and to that feast came Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine,</a>
<a id='line_14201'>and some called him Uwaine le Blanchemains. And this Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_14202'>challenged all the knights of Cornwall. Then was the king wood wroth</a>
<a id='line_14203'>that he had no knights to answer him. Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King</a>
<a id='line_14204'>Mark, leapt up and said: I will encounter with Sir Uwaine. Then he yede</a>
<a id='line_14205'>and armed him and horsed him in the best manner. And there Sir Uwaine</a>
<a id='line_14206'>met with Sir Andred, and smote him down that he swooned on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_14207'>Then was King Mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he had no knight</a>
<a id='line_14208'>to revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.</a>
<a id='line_14209'></a>
<a id='line_14210'>So the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him</a>
<a id='line_14211'>for his sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwaine. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14212'>Dinas, I am full loath to have ado with any knight of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_14213'>Yet, said the king, for my love take upon thee to joust. So Sir Dinas</a>
<a id='line_14214'>made him ready, and anon they encountered together with great spears,</a>
<a id='line_14215'>but Sir Dinas was overthrown, horse and man, a great fall. Who was</a>
<a id='line_14216'>wroth but King Mark! Alas, he said, have I no knight that will</a>
<a id='line_14217'>encounter with yonder knight? Sir, said Sir Gaheris, for your sake I</a>
<a id='line_14218'>will joust. So Sir Gaheris made him ready, and when he was armed he</a>
<a id='line_14219'>rode into the field. And when Sir Uwaine saw Sir Gaheris’ shield he</a>
<a id='line_14220'>rode to him and said: Sir, ye do not your part. For, sir, the first</a>
<a id='line_14221'>time ye were made Knight of the Round Table ye sware that ye should not</a>
<a id='line_14222'>have ado with your fellowship wittingly. And pardie, Sir Gaheris, ye</a>
<a id='line_14223'>knew me well enough by my shield, and so do I know you by your shield,</a>
<a id='line_14224'>and though ye would break your oath I would not break mine; for there</a>
<a id='line_14225'>is not one here, nor ye, that shall think I am afeard of you, but I</a>
<a id='line_14226'>durst right well have ado with you, and yet we be sisters’ sons. Then</a>
<a id='line_14227'>was Sir Gaheris ashamed, and so therewithal every knight went their</a>
<a id='line_14228'>way, and Sir Uwaine rode into the country.</a>
<a id='line_14229'></a>
<a id='line_14230'>Then King Mark armed him, and took his horse and his spear, with a</a>
<a id='line_14231'>squire with him. And then he rode afore Sir Uwaine, and suddenly at a</a>
<a id='line_14232'>gap he ran upon him as he that was not ware of him, and there he smote</a>
<a id='line_14233'>him almost through the body, and there left him. So within a while</a>
<a id='line_14234'>there came Sir Kay and found Sir Uwaine, and asked him how he was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_14235'>I wot not, said Sir Uwaine, why nor wherefore, but by treason I am sure</a>
<a id='line_14236'>I gat this hurt; for here came a knight suddenly upon me or that I was</a>
<a id='line_14237'>ware, and suddenly hurt me. Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King</a>
<a id='line_14238'>Mark. Thou traitor knight, said Sir Kay, an I wist it were thou that</a>
<a id='line_14239'>thus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my</a>
<a id='line_14240'>hands. Sir, said Sir Andred, I did never hurt him, and that I will</a>
<a id='line_14241'>report me to himself. Fie on you false knight, said Sir Kay, for ye of</a>
<a id='line_14242'>Cornwall are nought worth. So Sir Kay made carry Sir Uwaine to the</a>
<a id='line_14243'>Abbey of the Black Cross, and there he was healed. And then Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_14244'>took his leave of King Mark, but or he departed he said: Sir king, ye</a>
<a id='line_14245'>did a foul shame unto you and your court, when ye banished Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14246'>out of this country, for ye needed not to have doubted no knight an he</a>
<a id='line_14247'>had been here. And so he departed.</a>

<a id='line_14249'></a>
<a id='line_14250'></a>
<a id='line_14251'>CHAPTER XXVIII. Of the treason of King Mark, and how Sir Gaheris smote</a>
<a id='line_14252'>him down and Andred his cousin.</a>
<a id='line_14253'></a>
<a id='line_14254'>Then there came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, unto King Mark, and there he</a>
<a id='line_14255'>had good cheer showing outward. Now, fair lords, said he, will ye prove</a>
<a id='line_14256'>any adventure in the forest of Morris, in the which I know well is as</a>
<a id='line_14257'>hard an adventure as I know any. Sir, said Sir Kay, I will prove it.</a>
<a id='line_14258'>And Sir Gaheris said he would be avised for King Mark was ever full of</a>
<a id='line_14259'>treason: and therewithal Sir Gaheris departed and rode his way. And by</a>
<a id='line_14260'>the same way that Sir Kay should ride he laid him down to rest,</a>
<a id='line_14261'>charging his squire to wait upon Sir Kay; And warn me when he cometh.</a>
<a id='line_14262'>So within a while Sir Kay came riding that way, and then Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_14263'>took his horse and met him, and said: Sir Kay, ye are not wise to ride</a>
<a id='line_14264'>at the request of King Mark, for he dealeth all with treason. Then said</a>
<a id='line_14265'>Sir Kay: I require you let us prove this adventure. I shall not fail</a>
<a id='line_14266'>you, said Sir Gaheris. And so they rode that time till a lake that was</a>
<a id='line_14267'>that time called the Perilous Lake, and there they abode under the shaw</a>
<a id='line_14268'>of the wood.</a>
<a id='line_14269'></a>
<a id='line_14270'>The meanwhile King Mark within the castle of Tintagil avoided all his</a>
<a id='line_14271'>barons, and all other save such as were privy with him were avoided out</a>
<a id='line_14272'>of his chamber. And then he let call his nephew Sir Andred, and bade</a>
<a id='line_14273'>arm him and horse him lightly; and by that time it was midnight. And so</a>
<a id='line_14274'>King Mark was armed in black, horse and all; and so at a privy postern</a>
<a id='line_14275'>they two issued out with their varlets with them, and rode till they</a>
<a id='line_14276'>came to that lake. Then Sir Kay espied them first, and gat his spear,</a>
<a id='line_14277'>and proffered to joust. And King Mark rode against him, and smote each</a>
<a id='line_14278'>other full hard, for the moon shone as the bright day. And there at</a>
<a id='line_14279'>that jousts Sir Kay’s horse fell down, for his horse was not so big as</a>
<a id='line_14280'>the king’s horse, and Sir Kay’s horse bruised him full sore. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14281'>Gaheris was wroth that Sir Kay had a fall. Then he cried: Knight, sit</a>
<a id='line_14282'>thou fast in thy saddle, for I will revenge my fellow. Then King Mark</a>
<a id='line_14283'>was afeard of Sir Gaheris, and so with evil will King Mark rode against</a>
<a id='line_14284'>him, and Sir Gaheris gave him such a stroke that he fell down. So then</a>
<a id='line_14285'>forthwithal Sir Gaheris ran unto Sir Andred and smote him from his</a>
<a id='line_14286'>horse quite, that his helm smote in the earth, and nigh had broken his</a>
<a id='line_14287'>neck. And therewithal Sir Gaheris alighted, and gat up Sir Kay. And</a>
<a id='line_14288'>then they yode both on foot to them, and bade them yield them, and tell</a>
<a id='line_14289'>their names outher they should die. Then with great pain Sir Andred</a>
<a id='line_14290'>spake first, and said: It is King Mark of Cornwall, therefore be ye</a>
<a id='line_14291'>ware what ye do, and I am Sir Andred, his cousin. Fie on you both, said</a>
<a id='line_14292'>Sir Gaheris, for a false traitor, and false treason hast thou wrought</a>
<a id='line_14293'>and he both, under the feigned cheer that ye made us! it were pity,</a>
<a id='line_14294'>said Sir Gaheris, that thou shouldst live any longer. Save my life,</a>
<a id='line_14295'>said King Mark, and I will make amends; and consider that I am a king</a>
<a id='line_14296'>anointed. It were the more shame, said Sir Gaheris, to save thy life;</a>
<a id='line_14297'>thou art a king anointed with cream, and therefore thou shouldst hold</a>
<a id='line_14298'>with all men of worship; and therefore thou art worthy to die. With</a>
<a id='line_14299'>that he lashed at King Mark without saying any more, and covered him</a>
<a id='line_14300'>with his shield and defended him as he might. And then Sir Kay lashed</a>
<a id='line_14301'>at Sir Andred, and therewithal King Mark yielded him unto Sir Gaheris.</a>
<a id='line_14302'>And then he kneeled adown, and made his oath upon the cross of the</a>
<a id='line_14303'>sword, that never while he lived he would be against errant-knights.</a>
<a id='line_14304'>And also he sware to be good friend unto Sir Tristram if ever he came</a>
<a id='line_14305'>into Cornwall.</a>
<a id='line_14306'></a>
<a id='line_14307'>By then Sir Andred was on the earth, and Sir Kay would have slain him.</a>
<a id='line_14308'>Let be, said Sir Gaheris, slay him not I pray you. It were pity, said</a>
<a id='line_14309'>Sir Kay, that he should live any longer, for this is nigh cousin unto</a>
<a id='line_14310'>Sir Tristram, and ever he hath been a traitor unto him, and by him he</a>
<a id='line_14311'>was exiled out of Cornwall, and therefore I will slay him, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14312'>Kay. Ye shall not, said Sir Gaheris; sithen I have given the king his</a>
<a id='line_14313'>life, I pray you give him his life. And therewithal Sir Kay let him go.</a>
<a id='line_14314'>And so Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris rode their way unto Dinas, the</a>
<a id='line_14315'>Seneschal, for because they heard say that he loved well Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14316'>So they reposed them there, and soon after they rode unto the realm of</a>
<a id='line_14317'>Logris. And so within a little while they met with Sir Launcelot that</a>
<a id='line_14318'>always had Dame Bragwaine with him, to that intent he weened to have</a>
<a id='line_14319'>met the sooner with Sir Tristram; and Sir Launcelot asked what tidings</a>
<a id='line_14320'>in Cornwall, and whether they heard of Sir Tristram or not. Sir Kay and</a>
<a id='line_14321'>Sir Gaheris answered and said, that they heard not of him. Then they</a>
<a id='line_14322'>told Sir Launcelot word by word of their adventure. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14323'>smiled and said: Hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in</a>
<a id='line_14324'>the bone; and so made them merry together.</a>
<a id='line_14325'></a>
<a id='line_14326'></a>
<a id='line_14327'></a>
<a id='line_14328'>CHAPTER XIX. How after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14329'>Dinadan had been long in prison they were delivered.</a>
<a id='line_14330'></a>
<a id='line_14331'>Now leave we off this tale, and speak we of Sir Dinas that had within</a>
<a id='line_14332'>the castle a paramour, and she loved another knight better than him.</a>
<a id='line_14333'>And so when Sir Dinas went out a-hunting she slipped down by a towel,</a>
<a id='line_14334'>and took with her two brachets, and so she yede to the knight that she</a>
<a id='line_14335'>loved, and he her again. And when Sir Dinas came home and missed his</a>
<a id='line_14336'>paramour and his brachets, then was he the more wrother for his</a>
<a id='line_14337'>brachets than for the lady. So then he rode after the knight that had</a>
<a id='line_14338'>his paramour, and bade him turn and joust. So Sir Dinas smote him down,</a>
<a id='line_14339'>that with the fall he brake his leg and his arm. And then his lady and</a>
<a id='line_14340'>paramour cried Sir Dinas mercy, and said she would love him better than</a>
<a id='line_14341'>ever she did. Nay, said Sir Dinas, I shall never trust them that once</a>
<a id='line_14342'>betrayed me, and therefore, as ye have begun, so end, for I will never</a>
<a id='line_14343'>meddle with you. And so Sir Dinas departed, and took his brachets with</a>
<a id='line_14344'>him, and so rode to his castle.</a>
<a id='line_14345'></a>
<a id='line_14346'>Now will we turn unto Sir Launcelot, that was right heavy that he could</a>
<a id='line_14347'>never hear no tidings of Sir Tristram, for all this while he was in</a>
<a id='line_14348'>prison with Sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan. Then Dame Bragwaine</a>
<a id='line_14349'>took her leave to go into Cornwall, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Kay, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14350'>Gaheris rode to seek Sir Tristram in the country of Surluse.</a>
<a id='line_14351'></a>
<a id='line_14352'>Now speaketh this tale of Sir Tristram and of his two fellows, for</a>
<a id='line_14353'>every day Sir Palomides brawled and said language against Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_14354'>I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, of thee, Sir Palomides, an thou haddest Sir</a>
<a id='line_14355'>Tristram here thou wouldst do him no harm; for an a wolf and a sheep</a>
<a id='line_14356'>were together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in</a>
<a id='line_14357'>peace. And wit thou well, said Sir Dinadan, this same is Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_14358'>at a word, and now must thou do thy best with him, and let see now if</a>
<a id='line_14359'>ye can skift it with your hands. Then was Sir Palomides abashed and</a>
<a id='line_14360'>said little. Sir Palomides, then said Sir Tristram, I have heard much</a>
<a id='line_14361'>of your maugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this</a>
<a id='line_14362'>time by my will, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us in</a>
<a id='line_14363'>governance; for an I dread him not more than I do thee, soon it should</a>
<a id='line_14364'>be skift: so they peaced themself. Right so came in a damosel and said:</a>
<a id='line_14365'>Knights, be of good cheer, for ye are sure of your lives, and that I</a>
<a id='line_14366'>heard say my lord, Sir Darras. Then were they glad all three, for daily</a>
<a id='line_14367'>they weened they should have died.</a>
<a id='line_14368'></a>
<a id='line_14369'>Then soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he weened to have</a>
<a id='line_14370'>died; then Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides under them both</a>
<a id='line_14371'>making great sorrow. So a damosel came in to them and found them</a>
<a id='line_14372'>mourning. Then she went unto Sir Darras, and told him how that mighty</a>
<a id='line_14373'>knight that bare the black shield was likely to die. That shall not be,</a>
<a id='line_14374'>said Sir Darras, for God defend when knights come to me for succour</a>
<a id='line_14375'>that I should suffer them to die within my prison. Therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14376'>Darras to the damosel, fetch that knight and his fellows afore me. And</a>
<a id='line_14377'>then anon Sir Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him. He said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_14378'>knight, me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble</a>
<a id='line_14379'>knight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye well it shall never be</a>
<a id='line_14380'>said that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in</a>
<a id='line_14381'>prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby I was</a>
<a id='line_14382'>greatly aggrieved. But now shalt thou go and thy fellows, and your</a>
<a id='line_14383'>harness and horses have been fair and clean kept, and ye shall go where</a>
<a id='line_14384'>it liketh you, upon this covenant, that thou, knight, wilt promise me</a>
<a id='line_14385'>to be good friend to my sons two that be now alive, and also that thou</a>
<a id='line_14386'>tell me thy name. Sir, said he, as for me my name is Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_14387'>Liones, and in Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark. And</a>
<a id='line_14388'>as for the death of your sons I might not do withal, for an they had</a>
<a id='line_14389'>been the next kin that I have I might have done none otherwise. And if</a>
<a id='line_14390'>I had slain them by treason or treachery I had been worthy to have</a>
<a id='line_14391'>died. All this I consider, said Sir Darras, that all that ye did was by</a>
<a id='line_14392'>force of knighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to</a>
<a id='line_14393'>death. But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_14394'>heartily to be my good friend and to my sons. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_14395'>promise you by the faith of my body, ever while I live I will do you</a>
<a id='line_14396'>service, for ye have done to us but as a natural knight ought to do.</a>
<a id='line_14397'>Then Sir Tristram reposed him there till that he was amended of his</a>
<a id='line_14398'>sickness; and when he was big and strong they took their leave, and</a>
<a id='line_14399'>every knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till</a>
<a id='line_14400'>they came to a cross way. Now fellows, said Sir Tristram, here will we</a>
<a id='line_14401'>depart in sundry ways. And because Sir Dinadan had the first adventure</a>
<a id='line_14402'>of him I will begin.</a>
<a id='line_14403'></a>
<a id='line_14404'></a>
<a id='line_14405'></a>
<a id='line_14406'>CHAPTER XL. How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breuse Saunce Pité,</a>
<a id='line_14407'>and how Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_14408'></a>
<a id='line_14409'>So as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he found a lady making great dole.</a>
<a id='line_14410'>What aileth you? said Sir Dinadan. Sir knight, said the lady, I am the</a>
<a id='line_14411'>wofullest lady of the world, for within these five days here came a</a>
<a id='line_14412'>knight called Sir Breuse Saunce Pité, and he slew mine own brother, and</a>
<a id='line_14413'>ever since he hath kept me at his own will, and of all men in the world</a>
<a id='line_14414'>I hate him most; and therefore I require you of knighthood to avenge</a>
<a id='line_14415'>me, for he will not tarry, but be here anon. Let him come, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14416'>Dinadan, and because of honour of all women I will do my part. With</a>
<a id='line_14417'>this came Sir Breuse, and when he saw a knight with his lady he was</a>
<a id='line_14418'>wood wroth. And then he said: Sir knight, keep thee from me. So they</a>
<a id='line_14419'>hurtled together as thunder, and either smote other passing sore, but</a>
<a id='line_14420'>Sir Dinadan put him through the shoulder a grievous wound, and or ever</a>
<a id='line_14421'>Sir Dinadan might turn him Sir Breuse was gone and fled. Then the lady</a>
<a id='line_14422'>prayed him to bring her to a castle there beside but four mile thence;</a>
<a id='line_14423'>and so Sir Dinadan brought her there, and she was welcome, for the lord</a>
<a id='line_14424'>of that castle was her uncle; and so Sir Dinadan rode his way upon his</a>
<a id='line_14425'>adventure.</a>
<a id='line_14426'></a>
<a id='line_14427'>Now turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he came to a</a>
<a id='line_14428'>castle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay; and so when Sir</a>
<a id='line_14429'>Tristram was let into that castle he had good cheer all that night. And</a>
<a id='line_14430'>upon the morn when he would have departed the queen said: Wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_14431'>ye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner. Jesu</a>
<a id='line_14432'>defend! said Sir Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner. Fair knight,</a>
<a id='line_14433'>said the queen, ye shall abide with me till that I wit what ye are and</a>
<a id='line_14434'>from whence ye come. And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her</a>
<a id='line_14435'>own side, and her paramour on the other side. And ever Queen Morgan</a>
<a id='line_14436'>would behold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was</a>
<a id='line_14437'>in will suddenly to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he</a>
<a id='line_14438'>left it for shame. Then the queen said to Sir Tristram: Tell me thy</a>
<a id='line_14439'>name, and I shall suffer you to depart when ye will. Upon that covenant</a>
<a id='line_14440'>I tell you my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Morgan le Fay,</a>
<a id='line_14441'>an I had wist that, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou</a>
<a id='line_14442'>shalt. But sithen I have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou</a>
<a id='line_14443'>wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee,</a>
<a id='line_14444'>unto the castle of the Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a great</a>
<a id='line_14445'>tournament, and there I pray you that ye will be, and to do for me as</a>
<a id='line_14446'>much deeds of arms as ye may do. For at the Castle of Maidens, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14447'>Tristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever I heard knight do.</a>
<a id='line_14448'>Madam, said Sir Tristram, let me see the shield that I shall bear. Then</a>
<a id='line_14449'>the shield was brought forth, and the field was goldish, with a king</a>
<a id='line_14450'>and a queen therein painted, and a knight standing above them, [one</a>
<a id='line_14451'>foot] upon the king’s head, and the other upon the queen’s. Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_14452'>Sir Tristram, this is a fair shield and a mighty; but what signifieth</a>
<a id='line_14453'>this king and this queen, and the knight standing upon both their</a>
<a id='line_14454'>heads? I shall tell you, said Morgan le Fay, it signifieth King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_14455'>and Queen Guenever, and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and</a>
<a id='line_14456'>in servage. Who is that knight? said Sir Tristram. That shall ye not</a>
<a id='line_14457'>wit as at this time, said the queen. But as the French book saith,</a>
<a id='line_14458'>Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and ever she desired him, and he</a>
<a id='line_14459'>would never love her nor do nothing at her request, and therefore she</a>
<a id='line_14460'>held many knights together for to have taken him by strength. And</a>
<a id='line_14461'>because she deemed that Sir Launcelot loved Queen Guenever paramour,</a>
<a id='line_14462'>and she him again, therefore Queen Morgan le Fay ordained that shield</a>
<a id='line_14463'>to put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent that King Arthur might</a>
<a id='line_14464'>understand the love between them. Then Sir Tristram took that shield</a>
<a id='line_14465'>and promised her to bear it at the tournament at the Castle of the Hard</a>
<a id='line_14466'>Rock. But Sir Tristram knew not that that shield was ordained against</a>
<a id='line_14467'>Sir Launcelot, but afterward he knew it.</a>
<a id='line_14468'></a>
<a id='line_14469'></a>

<a id='line_14471'>CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how he</a>
<a id='line_14472'>slew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_14473'></a>
<a id='line_14474'>So then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the shield</a>
<a id='line_14475'>with him. Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le Fay, his name</a>
<a id='line_14476'>was Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow Sir Tristram. Fair</a>
<a id='line_14477'>friend, said Morgan, ride not after that knight, for ye shall not win</a>
<a id='line_14478'>no worship of him. Fie on him, coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist</a>
<a id='line_14479'>never good knight come out of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_14480'>Liones. What an that be he? said she. Nay, nay, said he, he is with La</a>
<a id='line_14481'>Beale Isoud, and this is but a daffish knight. Alas, my fair friend, ye</a>
<a id='line_14482'>shall find him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him</a>
<a id='line_14483'>better than ye do. For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay him.</a>
<a id='line_14484'>Ah, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will follow that</a>
<a id='line_14485'>knight, for I fear me sore of your again coming. With this this knight</a>
<a id='line_14486'>rode his way wood wroth, and he rode after Sir Tristram as fast as he</a>
<a id='line_14487'>had been chased with knights. When Sir Tristram heard a knight come</a>
<a id='line_14488'>after him so fast he returned about, and saw a knight coming against</a>
<a id='line_14489'>him. And when he came nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high: Sir</a>
<a id='line_14490'>knight, keep thee from me. Then they rushed together as it had been</a>
<a id='line_14491'>thunder, and Sir Hemison brised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his</a>
<a id='line_14492'>harness was so good that he might not hurt him. And Sir Tristram smote</a>
<a id='line_14493'>him harder, and bare him through the body, and he fell over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_14494'>croup. Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more with his sword, but</a>
<a id='line_14495'>he saw so much blood go from him that him seemed he was likely to die,</a>
<a id='line_14496'>and so he departed from him and came to a fair manor to an old knight,</a>
<a id='line_14497'>and there Sir Tristram lodged.</a>

<a id='line_14502'>Tristram praised Sir Launcelot and his kin.</a>
<a id='line_14503'></a>
<a id='line_14504'>Now leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight that was</a>
<a id='line_14505'>wounded to the death. Then his varlet alighted, and took off his helm,</a>
<a id='line_14506'>and then he asked his lord whether there were any life in him. There is</a>
<a id='line_14507'>in me life, said the knight, but it is but little; and therefore leap</a>
<a id='line_14508'>thou up behind me when thou hast holpen me up, and hold me fast that I</a>
<a id='line_14509'>fall not, and bring me to Queen Morgan le Fay; for deep draughts of</a>
<a id='line_14510'>death draw to my heart that I may not live, for I would fain speak with</a>
<a id='line_14511'>her or I died: for else my soul will be in great peril an I die.</a>
<a id='line_14512'>For[thwith] with great pain his varlet brought him to the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_14513'>there Sir Hemison fell down dead. When Morgan le Fay saw him dead she</a>
<a id='line_14514'>made great sorrow out of reason; and then she let despoil him unto his</a>
<a id='line_14515'>shirt, and so she let him put into a tomb. And about the tomb she let</a>
<a id='line_14516'>write: Here lieth Sir Hemison, slain by the hands of Sir Tristram de</a>
<a id='line_14517'>Liones.</a>
<a id='line_14518'></a>
<a id='line_14519'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that asked the knight his host if he saw</a>
<a id='line_14520'>late any knights adventurous. Sir, he said, the last night here lodged</a>
<a id='line_14521'>with me Ector de Maris and a damosel with him, and that damosel told me</a>
<a id='line_14522'>that he was one of the best knights of the world. That is not so, said</a>
<a id='line_14523'>Sir Tristram, for I know four better knights of his own blood, and the</a>
<a id='line_14524'>first is Sir Launcelot du Lake, call him the best knight, and Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_14525'>de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir Gaheris. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_14526'>said his host, Sir Gawaine is a better knight than he. That is not so,</a>
<a id='line_14527'>said Sir Tristram, for I have met with them both, and I felt Sir</a>
<a id='line_14528'>Gaheris for the better knight, and Sir Lamorak I call him as good as</a>
<a id='line_14529'>any of them except Sir Launcelot. Why name ye not Sir Tristram? said</a>
<a id='line_14530'>his host, for I account him as good as any of them. I know not Sir</a>
<a id='line_14531'>Tristram, said Tristram. Thus they talked and bourded as long as them</a>
<a id='line_14532'>list, and then went to rest. And on the morn Sir Tristram departed, and</a>
<a id='line_14533'>took his leave of his host, and rode toward the Roche Dure, and none</a>
<a id='line_14534'>adventure had Sir Tristram but that; and so he rested not till he came</a>
<a id='line_14535'>to the castle, where he saw five hundred tents.</a>
<a id='line_14536'></a>
<a id='line_14537'></a>
<a id='line_14538'></a>
<a id='line_14539'>CHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that</a>
<a id='line_14540'>Morgan le Fay delivered to him.</a>
<a id='line_14541'></a>
<a id='line_14542'>Then the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King</a>
<a id='line_14543'>Arthur’s knights, and there began a great medley. So came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_14544'>Tristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there he smote down many</a>
<a id='line_14545'>knights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that shield. And when</a>
<a id='line_14546'>King Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in what intent it was</a>
<a id='line_14547'>made; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore she was heavy.</a>
<a id='line_14548'>Then was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_14549'>and when she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake</a>
<a id='line_14550'>openly unto King Arthur. Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained</a>
<a id='line_14551'>for you, to warn you of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to</a>
<a id='line_14552'>you and your queen. And then anon that damosel picked her away privily,</a>
<a id='line_14553'>that no man wist where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and</a>
<a id='line_14554'>wroth, and asked from whence came that damosel. There was not one that</a>
<a id='line_14555'>knew her nor wist where she was become. Then Queen Guenever called to</a>
<a id='line_14556'>her Sir Ector de Maris, and there she made her complaint to him, and</a>
<a id='line_14557'>said: I wot well this shield was made by Morgan le Fay in despite of me</a>
<a id='line_14558'>and of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread me sore lest I should be</a>
<a id='line_14559'>destroyed. And ever the king beheld Sir Tristram, that did so</a>
<a id='line_14560'>marvellous deeds of arms that he wondered sore what knight he might be,</a>
<a id='line_14561'>and well he wist it was not Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14562'>Tristram was in Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he</a>
<a id='line_14563'>deemed, an he had been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of</a>
<a id='line_14564'>his fellows that were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should</a>
<a id='line_14565'>have found him or that time. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he</a>
<a id='line_14566'>might be. And ever Sir Arthur’s eye was on that shield. All that espied</a>
<a id='line_14567'>the queen, and that made her sore afeard.</a>
<a id='line_14568'></a>
<a id='line_14569'>Then ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what upon</a>
<a id='line_14570'>the right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might</a>
<a id='line_14571'>withstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to</a>
<a id='line_14572'>withdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight</a>
<a id='line_14573'>with the strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him</a>
<a id='line_14574'>Sir Uwaine le Blanche Mains, and bade him arm him and make him ready.</a>
<a id='line_14575'>So anon King Arthur and Sir Uwaine dressed them before Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14576'>and required him to tell them where he had that shield. Sir, he said, I</a>
<a id='line_14577'>had it of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_15460'>So they came together as thunder, and Sir Uwaine brised his spear all</a>
<a id='line_15461'>to pieces upon Sir Tristram’s shield, and Sir Tristram smote him harder</a>
<a id='line_15462'>and sorer, with such a might that he bare him clean out of his saddle</a>
<a id='line_15463'>to the earth. With that Sir Tristram turned about and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_15464'>knights, I had no need to joust with you, for I have had enough to do</a>
<a id='line_15465'>this day. Then arose Arthur and went to Sir Uwaine, and said to Sir</a>
<a id='line_15466'>Tristram: We have as we have deserved, for through our orgulyté we</a>
<a id='line_15467'>demanded battle of you, and yet we knew not your name. Nevertheless, by</a>
<a id='line_15468'>Saint Cross, said Sir Uwaine, he is a strong knight at mine advice as</a>
<a id='line_15469'>any is now living.</a>
<a id='line_15470'></a>
<a id='line_15471'>Then Sir Tristram departed, and in every place he asked and demanded</a>
<a id='line_15472'>after Sir Launcelot, but in no place he could not hear of him whether</a>
<a id='line_15473'>he were dead or alive; wherefore Sir Tristram made great dole and</a>
<a id='line_15474'>sorrow. So Sir Tristram rode by a forest, and then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_15475'>fair tower by a marsh on that one side, and on that other side a fair</a>
<a id='line_15476'>meadow. And there he saw ten knights fighting together. And ever the</a>
<a id='line_15477'>nearer he came he saw how there was but one knight did battle against</a>
<a id='line_15478'>nine knights, and that one did so marvellously that Sir Tristram had</a>
<a id='line_15479'>great wonder that ever one knight might do so great deeds of arms. And</a>
<a id='line_15480'>then within a little while he had slain half their horses and unhorsed</a>
<a id='line_15481'>them, and their horses ran in the fields and forest. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15482'>had so great pity of that one knight that endured so great pain, and</a>
<a id='line_15483'>ever he thought it should be Sir Palomides, by his shield. And so he</a>
<a id='line_15484'>rode unto the knights and cried unto them, and bade them cease of their</a>
<a id='line_15485'>battle, for they did themselves great shame so many knights to fight</a>
<a id='line_15486'>with one. Then answered the master of those knights, his name was</a>
<a id='line_15487'>called Breuse Saunce Pité, that was at that time the most mischievoust</a>
<a id='line_15488'>knight living, and said thus: Sir knight, what have ye ado with us to</a>
<a id='line_15489'>meddle? and therefore, an ye be wise, depart on your way as ye came,</a>
<a id='line_15490'>for this knight shall not escape us. That were pity, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_15491'>that so good a knight as he is should be slain so cowardly; and</a>
<a id='line_15492'>therefore I warn you I will succour him with all my puissance.</a>
<a id='line_15493'></a>
<a id='line_15494'></a>
<a id='line_15495'></a>
<a id='line_15496'></a>
<a id='line_15497'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Tristram saved Sir Palomides’ life, and how they</a>
<a id='line_15498'>promised to fight together within a fortnight.</a>
<a id='line_15499'></a>
<a id='line_15500'></a>
<a id='line_15501'>So Sir Tristram alighted off his horse because they were on foot, that</a>
<a id='line_15502'>they should not slay his horse, and then dressed his shield, with his</a>
<a id='line_15503'>sword in his hand, and he smote on the right hand and on the left hand</a>
<a id='line_15504'>passing sore, that well-nigh at every stroke he struck down a knight.</a>
<a id='line_15505'>And when they espied his strokes they fled all with Breuse Saunce Pité</a>
<a id='line_15506'>unto the tower, and Sir Tristram followed fast after with his sword in</a>
<a id='line_15507'>his hand, but they escaped into the tower, and shut Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15508'>without the gate. And when Sir Tristram saw this he returned aback unto</a>
<a id='line_15509'>Sir Palomides, and found him sitting under a tree sore wounded. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_15510'>fair knight, said Sir Tristram, well be ye found. Gramercy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15511'>Palomides, of your great goodness, for ye have rescued me of my life,</a>
<a id='line_15512'>and saved me from my death. What is your name? said Sir Tristram. He</a>
<a id='line_15513'>said: My name is Sir Palomides. O Jesu, said Sir Tristram, thou hast a</a>
<a id='line_15514'>fair grace of me this day that I should rescue thee, and thou art the</a>
<a id='line_15515'>man in the world that I most hate; but now make thee ready, for I will</a>
<a id='line_15516'>do battle with thee. What is your name? said Sir Palomides. My name is</a>
<a id='line_15517'>Sir Tristram, your mortal enemy. It may be so, said Sir Palomides; but</a>
<a id='line_15518'>ye have done over much for me this day that I should fight with you;</a>
<a id='line_15519'>for inasmuch as ye have saved my life it will be no worship for you to</a>
<a id='line_15520'>have ado with me, for ye are fresh and I am wounded sore, and</a>
<a id='line_15521'>therefore, an ye will needs have ado with me, assign me a day and then</a>
<a id='line_15522'>I shall meet with you without fail. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, now</a>
<a id='line_15523'>I assign you to meet me in the meadow by the river of Camelot, where</a>
<a id='line_15524'>Merlin set the peron. So they were agreed.</a>
<a id='line_15525'></a>
<a id='line_15526'>Then Sir Tristram asked Sir Palomides why the ten knights did battle</a>
<a id='line_15527'>with him. For this cause, said Sir Palomides; as I rode upon mine</a>
<a id='line_15528'>adventures in a forest here beside I espied where lay a dead knight,</a>
<a id='line_15529'>and a lady weeping beside him. And when I saw her making such dole, I</a>
<a id='line_15530'>asked her who slew her lord. Sir, she said, the falsest knight of the</a>
<a id='line_15531'>world now living, and he is the most villain that ever man heard speak</a>
<a id='line_15532'>of and his name is Sir Breuse Saunce Pité. Then for pity I made the</a>
<a id='line_15533'>damosel to leap on her palfrey, and I promised her to be her warrant,</a>
<a id='line_15534'>and to help her to inter her lord. And so, suddenly, as I came riding</a>
<a id='line_15535'>by this tower, there came out Sir Breuse Saunce Pité, and suddenly he</a>
<a id='line_15536'>struck me from my horse. And then or I might recover my horse this Sir</a>
<a id='line_15537'>Breuse slew the damosel. And so I took my horse again, and I was sore</a>
<a id='line_15538'>ashamed, and so began the medley betwixt us: and this is the cause</a>
<a id='line_15539'>wherefore we did this battle. Well, said Sir Tristram, now I understand</a>
<a id='line_15540'>the manner of your battle, but in any wise have remembrance of your</a>
<a id='line_15541'>promise that ye have made with me to do battle with me this day</a>
<a id='line_15542'>fortnight. I shall not fail you, said Sir Palomides. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15543'>Tristram, as at this time I will not fail you till that ye be out of</a>
<a id='line_15544'>the danger of your enemies.</a>
<a id='line_15545'></a>
<a id='line_15546'>So they mounted upon their horses, and rode together unto that forest,</a>
<a id='line_15547'>and there they found a fair well, with clear water bubbling. Fair sir,</a>
<a id='line_15548'>said Sir Tristram, to drink of that water have I courage; and then they</a>
<a id='line_15549'>alighted off their horses. And then were they ware by them where stood</a>
<a id='line_15550'>a great horse tied to a tree, and ever he neighed. And then were they</a>
<a id='line_15551'>ware of a fair knight armed, under a tree, lacking no piece of harness,</a>
<a id='line_15552'>save his helm lay under his head. By the good lord, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_15553'>yonder lieth a well-faring knight; what is best to do? Awake him, said</a>
<a id='line_15554'>Sir Palomides. So Sir Tristram awaked him with the butt of his spear.</a>
<a id='line_15555'>And so the knight rose up hastily and put his helm upon his head, and</a>
<a id='line_15556'>gat a great spear in his hand; and without any more words he hurled</a>
<a id='line_15557'>unto Sir Tristram, and smote him clean from his saddle to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_15558'>and hurt him on the left side, that Sir Tristram lay in great peril.</a>
<a id='line_15559'>Then he walloped farther, and fetched his course, and came hurling upon</a>
<a id='line_15560'>Sir Palomides, and there he struck him a part through the body, that he</a>
<a id='line_15561'>fell from his horse to the earth. And then this strange knight left</a>
<a id='line_15562'>them there, and took his way through the forest. With this Sir</a>
<a id='line_15563'>Palomides and Sir Tristram were on foot, and gat their horses again,</a>
<a id='line_15564'>and either asked counsel of other, what was best to do. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_15565'>said Sir Tristram, I will follow this strong knight that thus hath</a>
<a id='line_15566'>shamed us. Well, said Sir Palomides, and I will repose me hereby with a</a>
<a id='line_15567'>friend of mine. Beware, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, that ye fail</a>
<a id='line_15568'>not that day that ye have set with me to do battle, for, as I deem, ye</a>
<a id='line_15569'>will not hold your day, for I am much bigger than ye. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_15570'>Sir Palomides, be it as it be may, for I fear you not, for an I be not</a>
<a id='line_15571'>sick nor prisoner, I will not fail you; but I have cause to have more</a>
<a id='line_15572'>doubt of you that ye will not meet with me, for ye ride after yonder</a>
<a id='line_15573'>strong knight. And if ye meet with him it is an hard adventure an ever</a>
<a id='line_15574'>ye escape his hands. Right so Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides departed,</a>
<a id='line_15575'>and either took their ways diverse.</a>
<a id='line_15576'></a>
<a id='line_15577'></a>
<a id='line_15578'></a>
<a id='line_15579'></a>
<a id='line_15580'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Tristram sought a strong knight that had smitten</a>
<a id='line_15581'>him down, and many other knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_15582'></a>
<a id='line_15583'></a>
<a id='line_15584'>And so Sir Tristram rode long after this strong knight. And at the last</a>
<a id='line_15585'>he saw where lay a lady overthwart a dead knight. Fair lady, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15586'>Tristram, who hath slain your lord? Sir, she said, here came a knight</a>
<a id='line_15587'>riding, as my lord and I rested us here, and asked him of whence he</a>
<a id='line_15588'>was, and my lord said of Arthur’s court. Therefore, said the strong</a>
<a id='line_15589'>knight, I will joust with thee, for I hate all these that be of</a>
<a id='line_15590'>Arthur’s court. And my lord that lieth here dead amounted upon his</a>
<a id='line_15591'>horse, and the strong knight and my lord encountered together, and</a>
<a id='line_15592'>there he smote my lord throughout with his spear, and thus he hath</a>
<a id='line_15593'>brought me in great woe and damage. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15594'>Tristram, of your great anger; an it please you tell me your husband’s</a>
<a id='line_15595'>name. Sir, said she, his name was Galardoun, that would have proved a</a>
<a id='line_15596'>good knight. So departed Sir Tristram from that dolorous lady, and had</a>
<a id='line_15597'>much evil lodging. Then on the third day Sir Tristram met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_15598'>Gawaine and with Sir Bleoberis in a forest at a lodge, and either were</a>
<a id='line_15599'>sore wounded. Then Sir Tristram asked Sir Gawaine and Sir Bleoberis if</a>
<a id='line_15600'>they met with such a knight, with such a cognisance, with a covered</a>
<a id='line_15601'>shield. Fair sir, said these knights, such a knight met with us to our</a>
<a id='line_15602'>great damage. And first he smote down my fellow, Sir Bleoberis, and</a>
<a id='line_15603'>sore wounded him because he bade me I should not have ado with him, for</a>
<a id='line_15604'>why he was overstrong for me. That strong knight took his words at</a>
<a id='line_15605'>scorn, and said he said it for mockery. And then they rode together,</a>
<a id='line_15606'>and so he hurt my fellow. And when he had done so I might not for shame</a>
<a id='line_15607'>but I must joust with him. And at the first course he smote me down and</a>
<a id='line_15608'>my horse to the earth. And there he had almost slain me, and from us he</a>
<a id='line_15609'>took his horse and departed, and in an evil time we met with him. Fair</a>
<a id='line_15610'>knights, said Sir Tristram, so he met with me, and with another knight</a>
<a id='line_15611'>that hight Palomides, and he smote us both down with one spear, and</a>
<a id='line_15612'>hurt us right sore. By my faith, said Sir Gawaine, by my counsel ye</a>
<a id='line_15613'>shall let him pass and seek him no further; for at the next feast of</a>
<a id='line_15614'>the Round Table, upon pain of my head ye shall find him there. By my</a>
<a id='line_15615'>faith, said Sir Tristram, I shall never rest till that I find him. And</a>
<a id='line_15616'>then Sir Gawaine asked him his name. Then he said: My name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_15617'>Tristram. And so either told other their names, and then departed Sir</a>
<a id='line_15618'>Tristram and rode his way.</a>
<a id='line_15619'></a>
<a id='line_15620'>And by fortune in a meadow Sir Tristram met with Sir Kay, the</a>
<a id='line_15621'>Seneschal, and Sir Dinadan. What tidings with you, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_15622'>with you knights? Not good, said these knights. Why so? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15623'>Tristram; I pray you tell me, for I ride to seek a knight. What</a>
<a id='line_15624'>cognisance beareth he? said Sir Kay. He beareth, said Sir Tristram, a</a>
<a id='line_15625'>covered shield close with cloth. By my head, said Sir Kay, that is the</a>
<a id='line_15626'>same knight that met with us, for this night we were lodged within a</a>
<a id='line_15627'>widow’s house, and there was that knight lodged; and when he wist we</a>
<a id='line_15628'>were of Arthur’s court he spoke great villainy by the king, and</a>
<a id='line_15629'>specially by the Queen Guenever, and then on the morn was waged battle</a>
<a id='line_15630'>with him for that cause. And at the first recounter, said Sir Kay, he</a>
<a id='line_15631'>smote me down from my horse and hurt me passing sore; and when my</a>
<a id='line_15632'>fellow, Sir Dinadan, saw me smitten down and hurt he would not revenge</a>
<a id='line_15633'>me, but fled from me; and thus he departed. And then Sir Tristram asked</a>
<a id='line_15634'>them their names, and so either told other their names. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_15635'>Tristram departed from Sir Kay, and from Sir Dinadan, and so he passed</a>
<a id='line_15636'>through a great forest into a plain, till he was ware of a priory, and</a>
<a id='line_15637'>there he reposed him with a good man six days.</a>
<a id='line_15638'></a>
<a id='line_15639'></a>
<a id='line_15640'></a>
<a id='line_15641'></a>
<a id='line_15642'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le Desirous and</a>
<a id='line_15643'>Sir Dodinas le Savage.</a>
<a id='line_15644'></a>
<a id='line_15645'></a>
<a id='line_15646'>And then he sent his man that hight Gouvernail, and commanded him to go</a>
<a id='line_15647'>to a city thereby to fetch him new harness; for it was long time afore</a>
<a id='line_15648'>that that Sir Tristram had been refreshed, his harness was brised and</a>
<a id='line_15649'>broken. And when Gouvernail, his servant, was come with his apparel, he</a>
<a id='line_15650'>took his leave at the widow, and mounted upon his horse, and rode his</a>
<a id='line_15651'>way early on the morn. And by sudden adventure Sir Tristram met with</a>
<a id='line_15652'>Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and with Sir Dodinas le Savage. And these</a>
<a id='line_15653'>two knights met with Sir Tristram and questioned with him, and asked</a>
<a id='line_15654'>him if he would joust with them. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, with</a>
<a id='line_15655'>a good will I would joust with you, but I have promised at a day set,</a>
<a id='line_15656'>near hand, to do battle with a strong knight; and therefore I am loath</a>
<a id='line_15657'>to have ado with you, for an it misfortuned me here to be hurt I should</a>
<a id='line_15658'>not be able to do my battle which I promised. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_15659'>Sagramore, maugre your head, ye shall joust with us or ye pass from us.</a>
<a id='line_15660'>Well, said Sir Tristram, if ye enforce me thereto I must do what I may.</a>
<a id='line_15661'>And then they dressed their shields, and came running together with</a>
<a id='line_15662'>great ire. But through Sir Tristram’s great force he struck Sir</a>
<a id='line_15663'>Sagramore from his horse. Then he hurled his horse farther, and said to</a>
<a id='line_15664'>Sir Dodinas: Knight, make thee ready; and so through fine force Sir</a>
<a id='line_15665'>Tristram struck Dodinas from his horse. And when he saw them lie on the</a>
<a id='line_15666'>earth he took his bridle, and rode forth on his way, and his man</a>
<a id='line_15667'>Gouvernail with him.</a>
<a id='line_15668'></a>
<a id='line_15669'>Anon as Sir Tristram was passed, Sir Sagramore and Sir Dodinas gat</a>
<a id='line_15670'>again their horses, and mounted up lightly and followed after Sir</a>
<a id='line_15671'>Tristram. And when Sir Tristram saw them come so fast after him he</a>
<a id='line_15672'>returned with his horse to them, and asked them what they would. It is</a>
<a id='line_15673'>not long ago sithen I smote you to the earth at your own request and</a>
<a id='line_15674'>desire: I would have ridden by you, but ye would not suffer me, and now</a>
<a id='line_15675'>meseemeth ye would do more battle with me. That is truth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15676'>Sagramore and Sir Dodinas, for we will be revenged of the despite ye</a>
<a id='line_15677'>have done to us. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, that shall little</a>
<a id='line_15678'>need you, for all that I did to you ye caused it; wherefore I require</a>
<a id='line_15679'>you of your knighthood leave me as at this time, for I am sure an I do</a>
<a id='line_15680'>battle with you I shall not escape without great hurts, and as I</a>
<a id='line_15681'>suppose ye shall not escape all lotless. And this is the cause why I am</a>
<a id='line_15682'>so loath to have ado with you; for I must fight within these three days</a>
<a id='line_15683'>with a good knight, and as valiant as any is now living, and if I be</a>
<a id='line_15684'>hurt I shall not be able to do battle with him. What knight is that,</a>
<a id='line_15685'>said Sir Sagramore, that ye shall fight withal? Sirs, said he, it is a</a>
<a id='line_15686'>good knight called Sir Palomides. By my head, said Sir Sagramore and</a>
<a id='line_15687'>Sir Dodinas, ye have cause to dread him, for ye shall find him a</a>
<a id='line_15688'>passing good knight, and a valiant. And because ye shall have ado with</a>
<a id='line_15689'>him we will forbear you as at this time, and else ye should not escape</a>
<a id='line_15690'>us lightly. But, fair knight, said Sir Sagramore, tell us your name.</a>
<a id='line_15691'>Sir, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Sagramore and</a>
<a id='line_15692'>Sir Dodinas, well be ye found, for much worship have we heard of you.</a>
<a id='line_15693'>And then either took leave of other, and departed on their way.</a>

<a id='line_15699'>how they fought together unknown.</a>
<a id='line_15700'></a>
<a id='line_15701'></a>
<a id='line_15702'>Then departed Sir Tristram and rode straight unto Camelot, to the peron</a>
<a id='line_15703'>that Merlin had made to-fore, where Sir Lanceor, that was the king’s</a>
<a id='line_15704'>son of Ireland, was slain by the hands of Balin. And in that same place</a>
<a id='line_15705'>was the fair lady Colombe slain, that was love unto Sir Lanceor; for</a>
<a id='line_15706'>after he was dead she took his sword and thrust it through her body.</a>
<a id='line_15707'>And by the craft of Merlin he made to inter this knight, Lanceor, and</a>
<a id='line_15708'>his lady, Colombe, under one stone. And at that time Merlin prophesied</a>
<a id='line_15709'>that in that same place should fight two the best knights that ever</a>
<a id='line_15710'>were in Arthur’s days, and the best lovers. So when Sir Tristram came</a>
<a id='line_15711'>to the tomb where Lanceor and his lady were buried he looked about him</a>
<a id='line_15712'>after Sir Palomides. Then was he ware of a seemly knight came riding</a>
<a id='line_15713'>against him all in white, with a covered shield. When he came nigh Sir</a>
<a id='line_15714'>Tristram he said on high: Ye be welcome, sir knight, and well and truly</a>
<a id='line_15715'>have ye holden your promise. And then they dressed their shields and</a>
<a id='line_15716'>spears, and came together with all their might of their horses; and</a>
<a id='line_15717'>they met so fiercely that both their horses and knights fell to the</a>
<a id='line_15718'>earth, and as fast as they might avoided their horses, and put their</a>
<a id='line_15719'>shields afore them; and they struck together with bright swords, as men</a>
<a id='line_15720'>that were of might, and either wounded other wonderly sore, that the</a>
<a id='line_15721'>blood ran out upon the grass. And thus they fought the space of four</a>
<a id='line_15722'>hours, that never one would speak to other one word, and of their</a>
<a id='line_15723'>harness they had hewn off many pieces. O Lord Jesu, said Gouvernail, I</a>
<a id='line_15724'>marvel greatly of the strokes my master hath given to your master. By</a>
<a id='line_15725'>my head, said Sir Launcelot’s servant, your master hath not given so</a>
<a id='line_15726'>many but your master has received as many or more. O Jesu, said</a>
<a id='line_15727'>Gouvernail, it is too much for Sir Palomides to suffer or Sir</a>
<a id='line_15728'>Launcelot, and yet pity it were that either of these good knights</a>
<a id='line_15729'>should destroy other’s blood. So they stood and wept both, and made</a>
<a id='line_15730'>great dole when they saw the bright swords over-covered with blood of</a>
<a id='line_15731'>their bodies.</a>
<a id='line_15732'></a>
<a id='line_15733'>Then at the last spake Sir Launcelot and said: Knight, thou fightest</a>
<a id='line_15734'>wonderly well as ever I saw knight, therefore, an it please you, tell</a>
<a id='line_15735'>me your name. Sir, said Sir Tristram, that is me loath to tell any man</a>
<a id='line_15736'>my name. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, an I were required I was never</a>
<a id='line_15737'>loath to tell my name. It is well said, said Sir Tristram, then I</a>
<a id='line_15738'>require you to tell me your name? Fair knight, he said, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_15739'>Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Tristram, what have I done! for ye</a>
<a id='line_15740'>are the man in the world that I love best. Fair knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15741'>Launcelot, tell me your name? Truly, said he, my name is Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15742'>de Liones. O Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, what adventure is befallen me!</a>
<a id='line_15743'>And therewith Sir Launcelot kneeled down and yielded him up his sword.</a>
<a id='line_15744'>And therewith Sir Tristram kneeled adown, and yielded him up his sword.</a>
<a id='line_15745'>And so either gave other the degree. And then they both forthwithal</a>
<a id='line_15746'>went to the stone, and set them down upon it, and took off their helms</a>
<a id='line_15747'>to cool them, and either kissed other an hundred times. And then anon</a>
<a id='line_15748'>after they took off their helms and rode to Camelot. And there they met</a>
<a id='line_15749'>with Sir Gawaine and with Sir Gaheris that had made promise to Arthur</a>
<a id='line_15750'>never to come again to the court till they had brought Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15751'>with them.</a>
<a id='line_15752'></a>

<a id='line_15755'></a>
<a id='line_15756'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram to the court, and of</a>
<a id='line_15757'>the great joy that the king and other made for the coming of Sir</a>
<a id='line_15758'>Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_15759'></a>
<a id='line_15760'></a>
<a id='line_15761'>Return again, said Sir Launcelot, for your quest is done, for I have</a>
<a id='line_15762'>met with Sir Tristram: lo, here is his own person! Then was Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_15763'>glad, and said to Sir Tristram: Ye are welcome, for now have ye eased</a>
<a id='line_15764'>me greatly of my labour. For what cause, said Sir Gawaine, came ye into</a>
<a id='line_15765'>this court? Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, I came into this country</a>
<a id='line_15766'>because of Sir Palomides; for he and I had assigned at this day to have</a>
<a id='line_15767'>done battle together at the peron, and I marvel I hear not of him. And</a>
<a id='line_15768'>thus by adventure my lord, Sir Launcelot, and I met together. With this</a>
<a id='line_15769'>came King Arthur, and when he wist that there was Sir Tristram, then he</a>
<a id='line_15770'>ran unto him and took him by the hand and said: Sir Tristram, ye are as</a>
<a id='line_15771'>welcome as any knight that ever came to this court. And when the king</a>
<a id='line_15772'>had heard how Sir Launcelot and he had foughten, and either had wounded</a>
<a id='line_15773'>other wonderly sore, then the king made great dole. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15774'>told the king how he came thither for to have had ado with Sir</a>
<a id='line_15775'>Palomides. And then he told the king how he had rescued him from the</a>
<a id='line_15776'>nine knights and Breuse Saunce Pité; and how he found a knight lying by</a>
<a id='line_15777'>a well, and that knight smote down Sir Palomides and me, but his shield</a>
<a id='line_15778'>was covered with a cloth. So Sir Palomides left me, and I followed</a>
<a id='line_15779'>after that knight; and in many places I found where he had slain</a>
<a id='line_15780'>knights, and forjousted many. By my head, said Sir Gawaine, that same</a>
<a id='line_15781'>knight smote me down and Sir Bleoberis, and hurt us sore both, he with</a>
<a id='line_15782'>the covered shield. Ah, said Sir Kay, that knight smote me adown and</a>
<a id='line_15783'>hurt me passing sore, and fain would I have known him, but I might not.</a>
<a id='line_15784'>Jesu, mercy, said Arthur, what knight was that with the covered shield?</a>
<a id='line_15785'>I know not, said Sir Tristram; and so said they all. Now, said King</a>
<a id='line_15786'>Arthur, then wot I, for it is Sir Launcelot. Then they all looked upon</a>
<a id='line_15787'>Sir Launcelot and said: Ye have beguiled us with your covered shield.</a>
<a id='line_15788'>It is not the first time, said Arthur, he hath done so. My lord, said</a>
<a id='line_15789'>Sir Launcelot, truly wit ye well I was the same knight that bare the</a>
<a id='line_15790'>covered shield; and because I would not be known that I was of your</a>
<a id='line_15791'>court I said no worship of your house. That is truth, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_15792'>Sir Kay, and Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_15793'></a>
<a id='line_15794'>Then King Arthur took Sir Tristram by the hand and went to the Table</a>
<a id='line_15795'>Round. Then came Queen Guenever and many ladies with her, and all the</a>
<a id='line_15796'>ladies said at one voice: Welcome, Sir Tristram! Welcome, said the</a>
<a id='line_15797'>damosels. Welcome, said knights. Welcome, said Arthur, for one of the</a>
<a id='line_15798'>best knights, and the gentlest of the world, and the man of most</a>
<a id='line_15799'>worship; for of all manner of hunting thou bearest the prize, and of</a>
<a id='line_15800'>all measures of blowing thou art the beginning, and of all the terms of</a>
<a id='line_15801'>hunting and hawking ye are the beginner, of all instruments of music ye</a>
<a id='line_15802'>are the best; therefore, gentle knight, said Arthur, ye are welcome to</a>
<a id='line_15803'>this court. And also, I pray you, said Arthur, grant me a boon. It</a>
<a id='line_15804'>shall be at your commandment, said Tristram. Well, said Arthur, I will</a>
<a id='line_15805'>desire of you that ye will abide in my court. Sir, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_15806'>thereto is me loath, for I have ado in many countries. Not so, said</a>
<a id='line_15807'>Arthur, ye have promised it me, ye may not say nay. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15808'>Tristram, I will as ye will. Then went Arthur unto the sieges about the</a>
<a id='line_15809'>Round Table, and looked in every siege the which were void that lacked</a>
<a id='line_15810'>knights. And then the king saw in the siege of Marhaus letters that</a>
<a id='line_15811'>said: This is the siege of the noble knight, Sir Tristram. And then</a>
<a id='line_15812'>Arthur made Sir Tristram Knight of the Table Round, with great nobley</a>
<a id='line_15813'>and great feast as might be thought. For Sir Marhaus was slain afore by</a>
<a id='line_15814'>the hands of Sir Tristram in an island; and that was well known at that</a>
<a id='line_15815'>time in the court of Arthur, for this Marhaus was a worthy knight. And</a>
<a id='line_15816'>for evil deeds that he did unto the country of Cornwall Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15817'>and he fought. And they fought so long, tracing and traversing, till</a>
<a id='line_15818'>they fell bleeding to the earth; for they were so sore wounded that</a>
<a id='line_15819'>they might not stand for bleeding. And Sir Tristram by fortune</a>
<a id='line_15820'>recovered, and Sir Marhaus died through the stroke on the head. So</a>
<a id='line_15821'>leave we of Sir Tristram and speak we of King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_15822'></a>
<a id='line_15823'></a>
<a id='line_15824'></a>
<a id='line_15825'></a>
<a id='line_15826'>CHAPTER VII. How for the despite of Sir Tristram King Mark came with</a>
<a id='line_15827'>two knights into England, and how he slew one of the knights.</a>
<a id='line_15828'></a>
<a id='line_15829'></a>
<a id='line_15830'>Then King Mark had great despite of the renown of Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_15831'>then he chased him out of Cornwall: yet was he nephew unto King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_15832'>but he had great suspicion unto Sir Tristram because of his queen, La</a>
<a id='line_15833'>Beale Isoud; for him seemed that there was too much love between them</a>
<a id='line_15834'>both. So when Sir Tristram departed out of Cornwall into England King</a>
<a id='line_15835'>Mark heard of the great prowess that Sir Tristram did there, the which</a>
<a id='line_15836'>grieved him sore. So he sent on his part men to espy what deeds he did.</a>
<a id='line_15837'>And the queen sent privily on her part spies to know what deeds he had</a>
<a id='line_15838'>done, for great love was between them twain. So when the messengers</a>
<a id='line_15839'>were come home they told the truth as they had heard, that he passed</a>
<a id='line_15840'>all other knights but if it were Sir Launcelot. Then King Mark was</a>
<a id='line_15841'>right heavy of these tidings, and as glad was La Beale Isoud. Then in</a>
<a id='line_15842'>great despite he took with him two good knights and two squires, and</a>
<a id='line_15843'>disguised himself, and took his way into England, to the intent for to</a>
<a id='line_15844'>slay Sir Tristram. And one of these two knights hight Bersules, and the</a>
<a id='line_15845'>other knight was called Amant. So as they rode King Mark asked a knight</a>
<a id='line_15846'>that he met, where he should find King Arthur. He said: At Camelot.</a>
<a id='line_15847'>Also he asked that knight after Sir Tristram, whether he heard of him</a>
<a id='line_15848'>in the court of King Arthur. Wit you well, said that knight, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_15849'>find Sir Tristram there for a man of as great worship as is now living;</a>
<a id='line_15850'>for through his prowess he won the tournament of the Castle of Maidens</a>
<a id='line_15851'>that standeth by the Hard Rock. And sithen he hath won with his own</a>
<a id='line_15852'>hands thirty knights that were men of great honour. And the last battle</a>
<a id='line_15853'>that ever he did he fought with Sir Launcelot; and that was a</a>
<a id='line_15854'>marvellous battle. And not by force Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_15855'>to the court, and of him King Arthur made passing great joy, and so</a>
<a id='line_15856'>made him Knight of the Table Round; and his seat was where the good</a>
<a id='line_15857'>knight’s, Sir Marhaus, seat was. Then was King Mark passing sorry when</a>
<a id='line_15858'>he heard of the honour of Sir Tristram; and so they departed.</a>
<a id='line_15859'></a>
<a id='line_15860'>Then said King Mark unto his two knights: Now will I tell you my</a>
<a id='line_15861'>counsel: ye are the men that I trust most to alive, and I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_15862'>wit my coming hither is to this intent, for to destroy Sir Tristram by</a>
<a id='line_15863'>wiles or by treason; and it shall be hard if ever he escape our hands.</a>
<a id='line_15864'>Alas, said Sir Bersules, what mean you? for ye be set in such a way ye</a>
<a id='line_15865'>are disposed shamefully; for Sir Tristram is the knight of most worship</a>
<a id='line_15866'>that we know living, and therefore I warn you plainly I will never</a>
<a id='line_15867'>consent to do him to the death; and therefore I will yield my service,</a>
<a id='line_15868'>and forsake you. When King Mark heard him say so, suddenly he drew his</a>
<a id='line_15869'>sword and said: Ah, traitor; and smote Sir Bersules on the head, that</a>
<a id='line_15870'>the sword went to his teeth. When Amant, the knight, saw him do that</a>
<a id='line_15871'>villainous deed, and his squires, they said it was foul done, and</a>
<a id='line_15872'>mischievously: Wherefore we will do thee no more service, and wit ye</a>
<a id='line_15873'>well, we will appeach thee of treason afore Arthur. Then was King Mark</a>
<a id='line_15874'>wonderly wroth and would have slain Amant; but he and the two squires</a>
<a id='line_15875'>held them together, and set nought by his malice. When King Mark saw he</a>
<a id='line_15876'>might not be revenged on them, he said thus unto the knight, Amant: Wit</a>
<a id='line_15877'>thou well, an thou appeach me of treason I shall thereof defend me</a>
<a id='line_15878'>afore King Arthur; but I require thee that thou tell not my name, that</a>
<a id='line_15879'>I am King Mark, whatsomever come of me. As for that, said Sir Amant, I</a>
<a id='line_15880'>will not discover your name; and so they departed, and Amant and his</a>
<a id='line_15881'>fellows took the body of Bersules and buried it.</a>
<a id='line_15882'></a>

<a id='line_15885'></a>
<a id='line_15886'>CHAPTER VIII. How King Mark came to a fountain where he found Sir</a>
<a id='line_15887'>Lamorak complaining for the love of King Lot’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_15888'></a>
<a id='line_15889'></a>
<a id='line_15890'>Then King Mark rode till he came to a fountain, and there he rested</a>
<a id='line_15891'>him, and stood in a doubt whether he would ride to Arthur’s court or</a>
<a id='line_15892'>none, or return again to his country. And as he thus rested him by that</a>
<a id='line_15893'>fountain there came by him a knight well armed on horseback; and he</a>
<a id='line_15894'>alighted, and tied his horse until a tree, and set him down by the</a>
<a id='line_15895'>brink of the fountain; and there he made great languor and dole, and</a>
<a id='line_15896'>made the dolefullest complaint of love that ever man heard; and all</a>
<a id='line_15897'>this while was he not ware of King Mark. And this was a great part of</a>
<a id='line_15898'>his complaint: he cried and wept, saying: O fair Queen of Orkney, King</a>
<a id='line_15899'>Lot’s wife, and mother of Sir Gawaine, and to Sir Gaheris, and mother</a>
<a id='line_15900'>to many other, for thy love I am in great pains. Then King Mark arose</a>
<a id='line_15901'>and went near him and said: Fair knight, ye have made a piteous</a>
<a id='line_15902'>complaint. Truly, said the knight, it is an hundred part more ruefuller</a>
<a id='line_15903'>than my heart can utter. I require you, said King Mark, tell me your</a>
<a id='line_15904'>name. Sir, said he, as for my name I will not hide it from no knight</a>
<a id='line_15905'>that beareth a shield, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. But when</a>
<a id='line_15906'>Sir Lamorak heard King Mark speak, then wist he well by his speech that</a>
<a id='line_15907'>he was a Cornish knight. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I understand by your</a>
<a id='line_15908'>tongue ye be of Cornwall, wherein there dwelleth the shamefullest king</a>
<a id='line_15909'>that is now living, for he is a great enemy to all good knights; and</a>
<a id='line_15910'>that proveth well, for he hath chased out of that country Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_15911'>that is the worshipfullest knight that now is living, and all knights</a>
<a id='line_15912'>speak of him worship; and for jealousness of his queen he hath chased</a>
<a id='line_15913'>him out of his country. It is pity, said Sir Lamorak, that ever any</a>
<a id='line_15914'>such false knight-coward as King Mark is, should be matched with such a</a>
<a id='line_15915'>fair lady and good as La Beale Isoud is, for all the world of him</a>
<a id='line_15916'>speaketh shame, and of her worship that any queen may have. I have not</a>
<a id='line_15917'>ado in this matter, said King Mark, neither nought will I speak</a>
<a id='line_15918'>thereof. Well said, said Sir Lamorak. Sir, can ye tell me any tidings?</a>
<a id='line_15919'>I can tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that there shall be a great</a>
<a id='line_15920'>tournament in haste beside Camelot, at the Castle of Jagent; and the</a>
<a id='line_15921'>King with the Hundred Knights and the King of Ireland, as I suppose,</a>
<a id='line_15922'>make that tournament.</a>
<a id='line_15923'></a>
<a id='line_15924'>Then there came a knight that was called Sir Dinadan, and saluted them</a>
<a id='line_15925'>both. And when he wist that King Mark was a knight of Cornwall he</a>
<a id='line_15926'>reproved him for the love of King Mark a thousand fold more than did</a>
<a id='line_15927'>Sir Lamorak. Then he proffered to joust with King Mark. And he was full</a>
<a id='line_15928'>loath thereto, but Sir Dinadan edged him so, that he jousted with Sir</a>
<a id='line_15929'>Lamorak. And Sir Lamorak smote King Mark so sore that he bare him on</a>
<a id='line_15930'>his spear end over his horse’s tail. And then King Mark arose again,</a>
<a id='line_15931'>and followed after Sir Lamorak. But Sir Dinadan would not joust with</a>
<a id='line_15932'>Sir Lamorak, but he told King Mark that Sir Lamorak was Sir Kay, the</a>
<a id='line_15933'>Seneschal. That is not so, said King Mark, for he is much bigger than</a>
<a id='line_15934'>Sir Kay; and so he followed and overtook him, and bade him abide. What</a>
<a id='line_15935'>will you do? said Sir Lamorak. Sir, he said, I will fight with a sword,</a>
<a id='line_15936'>for ye have shamed me with a spear; and therewith they dashed together</a>
<a id='line_15937'>with swords, and Sir Lamorak suffered him and forbare him. And King</a>
<a id='line_15938'>Mark was passing hasty, and smote thick strokes. Sir Lamorak saw he</a>
<a id='line_15939'>would not stint, and waxed somewhat wroth, and doubled his strokes, for</a>
<a id='line_15940'>he was one of the noblest knights of the world; and he beat him so on</a>
<a id='line_15941'>the helm that his head hung nigh on the saddle bow. When Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_15942'>saw him fare so, he said: Sir knight, what cheer? meseemeth you have</a>
<a id='line_15943'>nigh your fill of fighting, it were pity to do you any more harm, for</a>
<a id='line_15944'>ye are but a mean knight, therefore I give you leave to go where ye</a>
<a id='line_15945'>list. Gramercy, said King Mark, for ye and I be not matches.</a>
<a id='line_15946'></a>
<a id='line_15947'>Then Sir Dinadan mocked King Mark and said: Ye are not able to match a</a>
<a id='line_15948'>good knight. As for that, said King Mark, at the first time I jousted</a>
<a id='line_15949'>with this knight ye refused him. Think ye that it is a shame to me?</a>
<a id='line_15950'>said Sir Dinadan: nay, sir, it is ever worship to a knight to refuse</a>
<a id='line_15951'>that thing that he may not attain, there fore your worship had been</a>
<a id='line_15952'>much more to have refused him as I did; for I warn you plainly he is</a>
<a id='line_15953'>able to beat such five as ye and I be; for ye knights of Cornwall are</a>
<a id='line_15954'>no men of worship as other knights are. And because ye are no men of</a>
<a id='line_15955'>worship ye hate all men of worship, for never was bred in your country</a>
<a id='line_15956'>such a knight as is Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_15957'></a>

<a id='line_15960'></a>
<a id='line_15961'>CHAPTER IX. How King Mark, Sir Lamorak, and Sir Dinadan came to a</a>
<a id='line_15962'>castle, and how King Mark was known there.</a>
<a id='line_15963'></a>
<a id='line_15964'></a>
<a id='line_15965'>Then they rode forth all together, King Mark, Sir Lamorak, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15966'>Dinadan, till that they came to a bridge, and at the end thereof stood</a>
<a id='line_15967'>a fair tower. Then saw they a knight on horseback well armed,</a>
<a id='line_15968'>brandishing a spear, crying and proffering himself to joust. Now, said</a>
<a id='line_15969'>Sir Dinadan unto King Mark, yonder are two brethren, that one hight</a>
<a id='line_15970'>Alein, and the other hight Trian, that will joust with any that passeth</a>
<a id='line_15971'>this passage. Now proffer yourself, said Dinadan to King Mark, for ever</a>
<a id='line_15972'>ye be laid to the earth. Then King Mark was ashamed, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_15973'>feutred his spear, and hurtled to Sir Trian, and either brake their</a>
<a id='line_15974'>spears all to pieces, and passed through anon. Then Sir Trian sent King</a>
<a id='line_15975'>Mark another spear to joust more; but in no wise he would not joust no</a>
<a id='line_15976'>more. Then they came to the castle all three knights, and prayed the</a>
<a id='line_15977'>lord of the castle of harbour. Ye are right welcome, said the knights</a>
<a id='line_15978'>of the castle, for the love of the lord of this castle, the which hight</a>
<a id='line_15979'>Sir Tor le Fise Aries. And then they came into a fair court well</a>
<a id='line_15980'>repaired, and they had passing good cheer, till the lieutenant of this</a>
<a id='line_15981'>castle, that hight Berluse, espied King Mark of Cornwall. Then said</a>
<a id='line_15982'>Berluse: Sir knight, I know you better than you ween, for ye are King</a>
<a id='line_15983'>Mark that slew my father afore mine own eyen; and me had ye slain had I</a>
<a id='line_15984'>not escaped into a wood; but wit ye well, for the love of my lord of</a>
<a id='line_15985'>this castle I will neither hurt you nor harm you, nor none of your</a>
<a id='line_15986'>fellowship. But wit ye well, when ye are past this lodging I shall hurt</a>
<a id='line_15987'>you an I may, for ye slew my father traitorly. But first for the love</a>
<a id='line_15988'>of my lord, Sir Tor, and for the love of Sir Lamorak, the honourable</a>
<a id='line_15989'>knight that here is lodged, ye shall have none ill lodging; for it is</a>
<a id='line_15990'>pity that ever ye should be in the company of good knights; for ye are</a>
<a id='line_15991'>the most villainous knight or king that is now known alive, for ye are</a>
<a id='line_15992'>a destroyer of good knights, and all that ye do is but treason.</a>
<a id='line_15993'></a>

<a id='line_15997'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Berluse met with King Mark, and how Sir Dinadan took</a>
<a id='line_15998'>his part.</a>
<a id='line_15999'></a>
<a id='line_16000'></a>
<a id='line_16001'>Then was King Mark sore ashamed, and said but little again. But when</a>
<a id='line_16002'>Sir Lamorak and Sir Dinadan wist that he was King Mark they were sorry</a>
<a id='line_16003'>of his fellowship. So after supper they went to lodging. So on the morn</a>
<a id='line_16004'>they arose early, and King Mark and Sir Dinadan rode together; and</a>
<a id='line_16005'>three mile from their lodging there met with them three knights, and</a>
<a id='line_16006'>Sir Berluse was one, and that other his two cousins. Sir Berluse saw</a>
<a id='line_16007'>King Mark, and then he cried on high: Traitor, keep thee from me for</a>
<a id='line_16008'>wit thou well that I am Berluse. Sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_16009'>counsel you to leave off at this time, for he is riding to King Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_16010'>and because I have promised to conduct him to my lord King Arthur needs</a>
<a id='line_16011'>must I take a part with him; howbeit I love not his condition, and fain</a>
<a id='line_16012'>I would be from him. Well, Dinadan, said Sir Berluse, me repenteth that</a>
<a id='line_16013'>ye will take part with him, but now do your best. And then he hurtled</a>
<a id='line_16014'>to King Mark, and smote him sore upon the shield, that he bare him</a>
<a id='line_16015'>clean out of his saddle to the earth. That saw Sir Dinadan, and he</a>
<a id='line_16016'>feutred his spear, and ran to one of Berluse’s fellows, and smote him</a>
<a id='line_16017'>down off his saddle. Then Dinadan turned his horse, and smote the third</a>
<a id='line_16018'>knight in the same wise to the earth, for Sir Dinadan was a good knight</a>
<a id='line_16019'>on horseback; and there began a great battle, for Berluse and his</a>
<a id='line_16020'>fellows held them together strongly on foot. And so through the great</a>
<a id='line_16021'>force of Sir Dinadan King Mark had Berluse to the earth, and his two</a>
<a id='line_16022'>fellows fled; and had not been Sir Dinadan King Mark would have slain</a>
<a id='line_16023'>him. And so Sir Dinadan rescued him of his life, for King Mark was but</a>
<a id='line_16024'>a murderer. And then they took their horses and departed and left Sir</a>
<a id='line_16025'>Berluse there sore wounded.</a>
<a id='line_16026'></a>
<a id='line_16027'>Then King Mark and Sir Dinadan rode forth a four leagues English, till</a>
<a id='line_16028'>that they came to a bridge where hoved a knight on horseback, armed and</a>
<a id='line_16029'>ready to joust. Lo, said Sir Dinadan unto King Mark, yonder hoveth a</a>
<a id='line_16030'>knight that will joust, for there shall none pass this bridge but he</a>
<a id='line_16031'>must joust with that knight. It is well, said King Mark, for this</a>
<a id='line_16032'>jousts falleth with thee. Sir Dinadan knew the knight well that he was</a>
<a id='line_16033'>a noble knight, and fain he would have jousted, but he had had liefer</a>
<a id='line_16034'>King Mark had jousted with him, but by no mean King Mark would not</a>
<a id='line_16035'>joust. Then Sir Dinadan might not refuse him in no manner. And then</a>
<a id='line_16036'>either dressed their spears and their shields, and smote together, so</a>
<a id='line_16037'>that through fine force Sir Dinadan was smitten to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_16038'>lightly he rose up and gat his horse, and required that knight to do</a>
<a id='line_16039'>battle with swords. And he answered and said: Fair knight, as at this</a>
<a id='line_16040'>time I may not have ado with you no more, for the custom of this</a>
<a id='line_16041'>passage is such. Then was Sir Dinadan passing wroth that he might not</a>
<a id='line_16042'>be revenged of that knight; and so he departed, and in no wise would</a>
<a id='line_16043'>that knight tell his name. But ever Sir Dinadan thought he should know</a>
<a id='line_16044'>him by his shield that it should be Sir Tor.</a>
<a id='line_16045'></a>

<a id='line_16049'>CHAPTER XI. How King Mark mocked Sir Dinadan, and how they met with six</a>
<a id='line_16050'>knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_16051'></a>
<a id='line_16052'></a>
<a id='line_16053'>So as they rode by the way King Mark then began to mock Sir Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_16054'>and said: I weened you knights of the Table Round might not in no wise</a>
<a id='line_16055'>find their matches. Ye say well, said Sir Dinadan; as for you, on my</a>
<a id='line_16056'>life I call you none of the best knights; but sith ye have such a</a>
<a id='line_16057'>despite at me I require you to joust with me to prove my strength. Not</a>
<a id='line_16058'>so, said King Mark, for I will not have ado with you in no manner; but</a>
<a id='line_16059'>I require you of one thing, that when ye come to Arthur’s court</a>
<a id='line_16060'>discover not my name, for I am there so hated. It is shame to you, said</a>
<a id='line_16061'>Sir Dinadan, that ye govern you so shamefully; for I see by you ye are</a>
<a id='line_16062'>full of cowardice, and ye are a murderer, and that is the greatest</a>
<a id='line_16063'>shame that a knight may have; for never a knight being a murderer hath</a>
<a id='line_16064'>worship, nor never shall have; for I saw but late through my force ye</a>
<a id='line_16065'>would have slain Sir Berluse, a better knight than ye, or ever ye shall</a>
<a id='line_16066'>be, and more of prowess. Thus they rode forth talking till they came to</a>
<a id='line_16067'>a fair place, where stood a knight, and prayed them to take their</a>
<a id='line_16068'>lodging with him. So at the request of that knight they reposed them</a>
<a id='line_16069'>there, and made them well at ease, and had great cheer. For all</a>
<a id='line_16070'>errant-knights were welcome to him, and specially all those of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_16071'>court. Then Sir Dinadan demanded his host what was the knight’s name</a>
<a id='line_16072'>that kept the bridge. For what cause ask you it? said the host. For it</a>
<a id='line_16073'>is not long ago, said Sir Dinadan, sithen he gave me a fall. Ah, fair</a>
<a id='line_16074'>knight, said his host, thereof have ye no marvel, for he is a passing</a>
<a id='line_16075'>good knight, and his name is Sir Tor, the son of Aries le Vaysher. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_16076'>said Sir Dinadan, was that Sir Tor? for truly so ever me thought.</a>
<a id='line_16077'></a>
<a id='line_16078'>Right as they stood thus talking together they saw come riding to them</a>
<a id='line_16079'>over a plain six knights of the court of King Arthur, well armed at all</a>
<a id='line_16080'>points. And there by their shields Sir Dinadan knew them well. The</a>
<a id='line_16081'>first was the good knight Sir Uwaine, the son of King Uriens, the</a>
<a id='line_16082'>second was the noble knight Sir Brandiles, the third was Ozana le Cure</a>
<a id='line_16083'>Hardy, the fourth was Uwaine les Aventurous, the fifth was Sir</a>
<a id='line_16084'>Agravaine, the sixth Sir Mordred, brother to Sir Gawaine. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_16085'>Dinadan had seen these six knights he thought in himself he would bring</a>
<a id='line_16086'>King Mark by some wile to joust with one of them. And anon they took</a>
<a id='line_16087'>their horses and ran after these knights well a three mile English.</a>
<a id='line_16088'>Then was King Mark ware where they sat all six about a well, and ate</a>
<a id='line_16089'>and drank such meats as they had, and their horses walking and some</a>
<a id='line_16090'>tied, and their shields hung in divers places about them. Lo, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16091'>Dinadan, yonder are knights-errant that will joust with us. God forbid,</a>
<a id='line_16092'>said King Mark, for they be six and we but two. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16093'>Dinadan, let us not spare, for I will assay the foremost; and therewith</a>
<a id='line_16094'>he made him ready. When King Mark saw him do so, as fast as Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_16095'>rode toward them, King Mark rode froward them with all his menial</a>
<a id='line_16096'>meiny. So when Sir Dinadan saw King Mark was gone, he set the spear out</a>
<a id='line_16097'>of the rest, and threw his shield upon his back, and came, riding to</a>
<a id='line_16098'>the fellowship of the Table Round. And anon Sir Uwaine knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_16099'>Dinadan, and welcomed him, and so did all his fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_16100'></a>

<a id='line_16104'>CHAPTER XII. How the six knights sent Sir Dagonet to joust with King</a>
<a id='line_16105'>Mark, and how King Mark refused him.</a>
<a id='line_16106'></a>
<a id='line_16107'></a>
<a id='line_16108'>And then they asked him of his adventures, and whether he had seen Sir</a>
<a id='line_16109'>Tristram or Sir Launcelot. So God me help, said Sir Dinadan, I saw none</a>
<a id='line_16110'>of them sithen I departed from Camelot. What knight is that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16111'>Brandiles, that so suddenly departed from you, and rode over yonder</a>
<a id='line_16112'>field? Sir, said he, it was a knight of Cornwall, and the most horrible</a>
<a id='line_16113'>coward that ever bestrode horse. What is his name? said all these</a>
<a id='line_16114'>knights. I wot not, said Sir Dinadan. So when they had reposed them,</a>
<a id='line_16115'>and spoken together, they took their horses and rode to a castle where</a>
<a id='line_16116'>dwelt an old knight that made all knights-errant good cheer. Then in</a>
<a id='line_16117'>the meanwhile that they were talking came into the castle Sir Griflet</a>
<a id='line_16118'>le Fise de Dieu, and there was he welcome; and they all asked him</a>
<a id='line_16119'>whether he had seen Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram. Sirs, he answered, I</a>
<a id='line_16120'>saw him not sithen he departed from Camelot. So as Sir Dinadan walked</a>
<a id='line_16121'>and beheld the castle, thereby in a chamber he espied King Mark, and</a>
<a id='line_16122'>then he rebuked him, and asked him why he departed so. Sir, said he,</a>
<a id='line_16123'>for I durst not abide because they were so many. But how escaped ye?</a>
<a id='line_16124'>said King Mark. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, they were better friends than I</a>
<a id='line_16125'>weened they had been. Who is captain of that fellowship? said the king.</a>
<a id='line_16126'>Then for to fear him Sir Dinadan said that it was Sir Launcelot. O</a>
<a id='line_16127'>Jesu, said the king, might I know Sir Launcelot by his shield? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_16128'>said Dinadan, for he beareth a shield of silver and black bends. All</a>
<a id='line_16129'>this he said to fear the king, for Sir Launcelot was not in his</a>
<a id='line_16130'>fellowship. Now I pray you, said King Mark, that ye will ride in my</a>
<a id='line_16131'>fellowship. That is me loath to do, said Sir Dinadan, because ye</a>
<a id='line_16132'>forsook my fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_16133'></a>
<a id='line_16134'>Right so Sir Dinadan went from King Mark, and went to his own</a>
<a id='line_16135'>fellowship; and so they mounted upon their horses, and rode on their</a>
<a id='line_16136'>ways, and talked of the Cornish knight, for Dinadan told them that he</a>
<a id='line_16137'>was in the castle where they were lodged. It is well said, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16138'>Griflet, for here have I brought Sir Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, that</a>
<a id='line_16139'>is the best fellow and the merriest in the world. Will ye do well? said</a>
<a id='line_16140'>Sir Dinadan: I have told the Cornish knight that here is Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16141'>and the Cornish knight asked me what shield he bare. Truly, I told him</a>
<a id='line_16142'>that he bare the same shield that Sir Mordred beareth. Will ye do well?</a>
<a id='line_16143'>said Sir Mordred; I am hurt and may not well bear my shield nor</a>
<a id='line_16144'>harness, and therefore put my shield and my harness upon Sir Dagonet,</a>
<a id='line_16145'>and let him set upon the Cornish knight. That shall be done, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16146'>Dagonet, by my faith. Then anon was Dagonet armed him in Mordred’s</a>
<a id='line_16147'>harness and his shield, and he was set on a great horse, and a spear in</a>
<a id='line_16148'>his hand. Now, said Dagonet, shew me the knight, and I trow I shall</a>
<a id='line_16149'>bear him down. So all these knights rode to a woodside, and abode till</a>
<a id='line_16150'>King Mark came by the way. Then they put forth Sir Dagonet, and he came</a>
<a id='line_16151'>on all the while his horse might run, straight upon King Mark. And when</a>
<a id='line_16152'>he came nigh King Mark, he cried as he were wood, and said: Keep thee,</a>
<a id='line_16153'>knight of Cornwall, for I will slay thee. Anon, as King Mark beheld his</a>
<a id='line_16154'>shield, he said to himself: Yonder is Sir Launcelot; alas, now am I</a>
<a id='line_16155'>destroyed; and therewithal he made his horse to run as fast as it might</a>
<a id='line_16156'>through thick and thin. And ever Sir Dagonet followed after King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_16157'>crying and rating him as a wood man, through a great forest. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_16158'>Uwaine and Sir Brandiles saw Dagonet so chase King Mark, they laughed</a>
<a id='line_16159'>all as they were wood. And then they took their horses, and rode after</a>
<a id='line_16160'>to see how Sir Dagonet sped, for they would not for no good that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16161'>Dagonet were shent, for King Arthur loved him passing well, and made</a>
<a id='line_16162'>him knight with his own hands. And at every tournament he began to make</a>
<a id='line_16163'>King Arthur to laugh. Then the knights rode here and there, crying and</a>
<a id='line_16164'>chasing after King Mark, that all the forest rang of the noise.</a>

<a id='line_16170'>how he overthrew Dagonet and other knights.</a>
<a id='line_16171'></a>
<a id='line_16172'></a>
<a id='line_16173'>So King Mark rode by fortune by a well, in the way where stood a</a>
<a id='line_16174'>knight-errant on horseback, armed at all points, with a great spear in</a>
<a id='line_16175'>his hand. And when he saw King Mark coming flying he said: Knight,</a>
<a id='line_16176'>return again for shame and stand with me, and I shall be thy warrant.</a>
<a id='line_16177'>Ah, fair knight, said King Mark, let me pass, for yonder cometh after</a>
<a id='line_16178'>me the best knight of the world, with the black bended shield. Fie, for</a>
<a id='line_16179'>shame, said the knight, he is none of the worthy knights, and if he</a>
<a id='line_16180'>were Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram I should not doubt to meet the</a>
<a id='line_16181'>better of them both. When King Mark heard him say that word, he turned</a>
<a id='line_16182'>his horse and abode by him. And then that strong knight bare a spear to</a>
<a id='line_16183'>Dagonet, and smote him so sore that he bare him over his horse’s tail,</a>
<a id='line_16184'>and nigh he had broken his neck. And anon after him came Sir Brandiles,</a>
<a id='line_16185'>and when he saw Dagonet have that fall he was passing wroth, and cried:</a>
<a id='line_16186'>Keep thee, knight, and so they hurtled together wonder sore. But the</a>
<a id='line_16187'>knight smote Sir Brandiles so sore that he went to the earth, horse and</a>
<a id='line_16188'>man. Sir Uwaine came after and saw all this. Jesu, said he, yonder is a</a>
<a id='line_16189'>strong knight. And then they feutred their spears, and this knight came</a>
<a id='line_16190'>so eagerly that he smote down Sir Uwaine. Then came Ozana with the</a>
<a id='line_16191'>hardy heart, and he was smitten down. Now, said Sir Griflet, by my</a>
<a id='line_16192'>counsel let us send to yonder errant-knight, and wit whether he be of</a>
<a id='line_16193'>Arthur’s court, for as I deem it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. So they sent</a>
<a id='line_16194'>unto him, and prayed the strange knight to tell his name, and whether</a>
<a id='line_16195'>he were of Arthur’s court or not. As for my name they shall not wit,</a>
<a id='line_16196'>but tell them I am a knight-errant as they are, and let them wit that I</a>
<a id='line_16197'>am no knight of King Arthur’s court; and so the squire rode again unto</a>
<a id='line_16198'>them and told them his answer of him. By my head, said Sir Agravaine,</a>
<a id='line_16199'>he is one of the strongest knights that ever I saw, for he hath</a>
<a id='line_16200'>overthrown three noble knights, and needs we must encounter with him</a>
<a id='line_16201'>for shame. So Sir Agravaine feutred his spear, and that other was</a>
<a id='line_16202'>ready, and smote him down over his horse to the earth. And in the same</a>
<a id='line_16203'>wise he smote Sir Uwaine les Avoutres and also Sir Griflet. Then had he</a>
<a id='line_16204'>served them all but Sir Dinadan, for he was behind, and Sir Mordred was</a>
<a id='line_16205'>unarmed, and Dagonet had his harness.</a>
<a id='line_16206'></a>
<a id='line_16207'>So when this was done, this strong knight rode on his way a soft pace,</a>
<a id='line_16208'>and King Mark rode after him, praising him mickle; but he would answer</a>
<a id='line_16209'>no words, but sighed wonderly sore, hanging down his head, taking no</a>
<a id='line_16210'>heed to his words. Thus they rode well a three mile English, and then</a>
<a id='line_16211'>this knight called to him a varlet, and bade him ride until yonder fair</a>
<a id='line_16212'>manor, and recommend me to the lady of that castle and place, and pray</a>
<a id='line_16213'>her to send me refreshing of good meats and drinks. And if she ask thee</a>
<a id='line_16214'>what I am, tell her that I am the knight that followeth the glatisant</a>
<a id='line_16215'>beast: that is in English to say the questing beast; for that beast</a>
<a id='line_16216'>wheresomever he yede he quested in the belly with such a noise as it</a>
<a id='line_16217'>had been a thirty couple of hounds. Then the varlet went his way and</a>
<a id='line_16218'>came to the manor, and saluted the lady, and told her from whence he</a>
<a id='line_16219'>came. And when she understood that he came from the knight that</a>
<a id='line_16220'>followed the questing beast: O sweet Lord Jesu, she said, when shall I</a>
<a id='line_16221'>see that noble knight, my dear son Palomides? Alas, will he not abide</a>
<a id='line_16222'>with me? and therewith she swooned and wept, and made passing great</a>
<a id='line_16223'>dole. And then also soon as she might she gave the varlet all that he</a>
<a id='line_16224'>asked. And the varlet returned unto Sir Palomides, for he was a varlet</a>
<a id='line_16225'>of King Mark. And as soon as he came, he told the knight’s name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_16226'>Palomides. I am well pleased, said King Mark, but hold thee still and</a>
<a id='line_16227'>say nothing. Then they alighted and set them down and reposed them a</a>
<a id='line_16228'>while. Anon withal King Mark fell asleep. When Sir Palomides saw him</a>
<a id='line_16229'>sound asleep he took his horse and rode his way, and said to them: I</a>
<a id='line_16230'>will not be in the company of a sleeping knight. And so he rode forth a</a>
<a id='line_16231'>great pace.</a>

<a id='line_16240'>Now turn we unto Sir Dinadan, that found these seven knights passing</a>
<a id='line_16241'>heavy. And when he wist how that they sped, as heavy was he. My lord</a>
<a id='line_16242'>Uwaine, said Dinadan, I dare lay my head it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. I</a>
<a id='line_16243'>promise you all I shall find him an he may be found in this country.</a>
<a id='line_16244'>And so Sir Dinadan rode after this knight; and so did King Mark, that</a>
<a id='line_16245'>sought him through the forest. So as King Mark rode after Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_16246'>he heard the noise of a man that made great dole. Then King Mark rode</a>
<a id='line_16247'>as nigh that noise as he might and as he durst. Then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_16248'>knight that was descended off his horse, and had put off his helm, and</a>
<a id='line_16249'>there he made a piteous complaint and a dolorous, of love.</a>
<a id='line_16250'></a>
<a id='line_16251'>Now leave we that, and talk we of Sir Dinadan, that rode to seek Sir</a>
<a id='line_16252'>Palomides. And as he came within a forest he met with a knight, a</a>
<a id='line_16253'>chaser of a deer. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, met ye with a knight with a</a>
<a id='line_16254'>shield of silver and lions’ heads? Yea, fair knight, said the other,</a>
<a id='line_16255'>with such a knight met I with but a while agone, and straight yonder</a>
<a id='line_16256'>way he yede. Gramercy, said Sir Dinadan, for might I find the track of</a>
<a id='line_16257'>his horse I should not fail to find that knight. Right so as Sir</a>
<a id='line_16258'>Dinadan rode in the even late he heard a doleful noise as it were of a</a>
<a id='line_16259'>man. Then Sir Dinadan rode toward that noise; and when he came nigh</a>
<a id='line_16260'>that noise he alighted off his horse, and went near him on foot. Then</a>
<a id='line_16261'>was he ware of a knight that stood under a tree, and his horse tied by</a>
<a id='line_16262'>him, and the helm off his head; and ever that knight made a doleful</a>
<a id='line_16263'>complaint as ever made knight. And always he made his complaint of La</a>
<a id='line_16264'>Beale Isoud, the Queen of Cornwall, and said: Ah, fair lady, why love I</a>
<a id='line_16265'>thee! for thou art fairest of all other, and yet showest thou never</a>
<a id='line_16266'>love to me, nor bounty. Alas, yet must I love thee. And I may not blame</a>
<a id='line_16267'>thee, fair lady, for mine eyes be cause of this sorrow. And yet to love</a>
<a id='line_16268'>thee I am but a fool, for the best knight of the world loveth thee, and</a>
<a id='line_16269'>ye him again, that is Sir Tristram de Liones. And the falsest king and</a>
<a id='line_16270'>knight is your husband, and the most coward and full of treason, is</a>
<a id='line_16271'>your lord, King Mark. Alas, that ever so fair a lady and peerless of</a>
<a id='line_16272'>all other should be matched with the most villainous knight of the</a>
<a id='line_16273'>world. All this language heard King Mark, what Sir Palomides said by</a>
<a id='line_16274'>him; wherefore he was adread when he saw Sir Dinadan, lest he espied</a>
<a id='line_16275'>him, that he would tell Sir Palomides that he was King Mark; and</a>
<a id='line_16276'>therefore he withdrew him, and took his horse and rode to his men,</a>
<a id='line_16277'>where he commanded them to abide. And so he rode as fast as he might</a>
<a id='line_16278'>unto Camelot; and the same day he found there Amant, the knight, ready</a>
<a id='line_16279'>that afore Arthur had appealed him of treason; and so, lightly the king</a>
<a id='line_16280'>commanded them to do battle. And by misadventure King Mark smote Amant</a>
<a id='line_16281'>through the body. And yet was Amant in the righteous quarrel. And right</a>
<a id='line_16282'>so he took his horse and departed from the court for dread of Sir</a>
<a id='line_16283'>Dinadan, that he would tell Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides what he was.</a>
<a id='line_16284'>Then were there maidens that La Beale Isoud had sent to Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_16285'>that knew Sir Amant well.</a>
<a id='line_16286'></a>

<a id='line_16290'>CHAPTER XV. How King Mark had slain Sir Amant wrongfully to-fore King</a>
<a id='line_16291'>Arthur, and Sir Launcelot fetched King Mark to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_16292'></a>
<a id='line_16293'></a>
<a id='line_16294'>Then by the license of King Arthur they went to him and spake with him;</a>
<a id='line_16295'>for while the truncheon of the spear stuck in his body he spake: Ah,</a>
<a id='line_16296'>fair damosels, said Amant, recommend me unto La Beale Isoud, and tell</a>
<a id='line_16297'>her that I am slain for the love of her and of Sir Tristram. And there</a>
<a id='line_16298'>he told the damosels how cowardly King Mark had slain him, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16299'>Bersules, his fellow. And for that deed I appealed him of treason, and</a>
<a id='line_16300'>here am I slain in a righteous quarrel; and all was because Sir</a>
<a id='line_16301'>Bersules and I would not consent by treason to slay the noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_16302'>Sir Tristram. Then the two maidens cried aloud that all the court might</a>
<a id='line_16303'>hear it, and said: O sweet Lord Jesu, that knowest all hid things, why</a>
<a id='line_16304'>sufferest Thou so false a traitor to vanquish and slay a true knight</a>
<a id='line_16305'>that fought in a righteous quarrel? Then anon it was sprung to the</a>
<a id='line_16306'>king, and the queen, and to all the lords, that it was King Mark that</a>
<a id='line_16307'>had slain Sir Amant, and Sir Bersules afore hand; wherefore they did</a>
<a id='line_16308'>their battle. Then was King Arthur wroth out of measure, and so were</a>
<a id='line_16309'>all the other knights. But when Sir Tristram knew all the matter he</a>
<a id='line_16310'>made great dole and sorrow out of measure, and wept for sorrow for the</a>
<a id='line_16311'>loss of the noble knights, Sir Bersules and of Sir Amant.</a>
<a id='line_16312'></a>
<a id='line_16313'>When Sir Launcelot espied Sir Tristram weep he went hastily to King</a>
<a id='line_16314'>Arthur, and said: Sir, I pray you give me leave to return again to</a>
<a id='line_16315'>yonder false king and knight. I pray you, said King Arthur, fetch him</a>
<a id='line_16316'>again, but I would not that ye slew him, for my worship. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16317'>Launcelot armed him in all haste, and mounted upon a great horse, and</a>
<a id='line_16318'>took a spear in his hand and rode after King Mark. And from thence a</a>
<a id='line_16319'>three mile English Sir Launcelot over took him, and bade him: Turn</a>
<a id='line_16320'>recreant king and knight, for whether thou wilt or not thou shalt go</a>
<a id='line_16321'>with me to King Arthur’s court. King Mark returned and looked upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_16322'>Launcelot, and said: Fair sir, what is your name? Wit thou well, said</a>
<a id='line_16323'>he, my name is Sir Launcelot, and therefore defend thee. And when King</a>
<a id='line_16324'>Mark wist that it was Sir Launcelot, and came so fast upon him with a</a>
<a id='line_16325'>spear, he cried then aloud: I yield me to thee, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16326'>honourable knight. But Sir Launcelot would not hear him, but came fast</a>
<a id='line_16327'>upon him. King Mark saw that, and made no defence, but tumbled adown</a>
<a id='line_16328'>out of his saddle to the earth as a sack, and there he lay still, and</a>
<a id='line_16329'>cried Sir Launcelot mercy. Arise, recreant knight and king. I will not</a>
<a id='line_16330'>fight, said King Mark, but whither that ye will I will go with you.</a>
<a id='line_16331'>Alas, alas, said Sir Launcelot, that I may not give thee one buffet for</a>
<a id='line_16332'>the love of Sir Tristram and of La Beale Isoud, and for the two knights</a>
<a id='line_16333'>that thou hast slain traitorly. And so he mounted upon his horse and</a>
<a id='line_16334'>brought him to King Arthur; and there King Mark alighted in that same</a>
<a id='line_16335'>place, and threw his helm from him upon the earth, and his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_16336'>fell flat to the earth of King Arthur’s feet, and put him in his grace</a>
<a id='line_16337'>and mercy. So God me help, said Arthur, ye are welcome in a manner, and</a>
<a id='line_16338'>in a manner ye are not welcome. In this manner ye are welcome, that ye</a>
<a id='line_16339'>come hither maugre thy head, as I suppose. That is truth, said King</a>
<a id='line_16340'>Mark, and else I had not been here, for my lord, Sir Launcelot, brought</a>
<a id='line_16341'>me hither through his fine force, and to him am I yolden to as</a>
<a id='line_16342'>recreant. Well, said Arthur, ye understand ye ought to do me service,</a>
<a id='line_16343'>homage, and fealty. And never would ye do me none, but ever ye have</a>
<a id='line_16344'>been against me, and a destroyer of my knights; now, how will ye acquit</a>
<a id='line_16345'>you? Sir, said King Mark, right as your lordship will require me, unto</a>
<a id='line_16346'>my power, I will make a large amends. For he was a fair speaker, and</a>
<a id='line_16347'>false thereunder. Then for great pleasure of Sir Tristram, to make them</a>
<a id='line_16348'>twain accorded, the king withheld King Mark as at that time, and made a</a>
<a id='line_16349'>broken love-day between them.</a>

<a id='line_16355'>Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristam.</a>
<a id='line_16356'></a>
<a id='line_16357'></a>
<a id='line_16358'>Now turn we again unto Sir Palomides, how Sir Dinadan comforted him in</a>
<a id='line_16359'>all that he might, from his great sorrow. What knight are ye? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16360'>Palomides. Sir, I am a knight-errant as ye be, that hath sought you</a>
<a id='line_16361'>long by your shield. Here is my shield, said Sir Palomides, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_16362'>well, an ye will ought, therewith I will defend it. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16363'>Dinadan, I will not have ado with you but in good manner. And if ye</a>
<a id='line_16364'>will, ye shall find me soon ready. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, whitherward</a>
<a id='line_16365'>ride you this way? By my head, said Sir Palomides, I wot not, but as</a>
<a id='line_16366'>fortune leadeth me. Heard ye or saw ye ought of Sir Tristram? So God me</a>
<a id='line_16367'>help, of Sir Tristram I both heard and saw, and not for then we loved</a>
<a id='line_16368'>not inwardly well together, yet at my mischief Sir Tristram rescued me</a>
<a id='line_16369'>from my death; and yet, or he and I departed, by both our assents we</a>
<a id='line_16370'>assigned a day that we should have met at the stony grave that Merlin</a>
<a id='line_16371'>set beside Camelot, and there to have done battle together; howbeit I</a>
<a id='line_16372'>was letted, said Sir Palomides, that I might not hold my day, the which</a>
<a id='line_16373'>grieveth me sore; but I have a large excuse. For I was prisoner with a</a>
<a id='line_16374'>lord, and many other more, and that shall Sir Tristram right well</a>
<a id='line_16375'>understand, that I brake it not of fear of cowardice. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16376'>Palomides told Sir Dinadan the same day that they should have met. So</a>
<a id='line_16377'>God me help, said Sir Dinadan, that same day met Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16378'>Tristram at the same grave of stone. And there was the most mightiest</a>
<a id='line_16379'>battle that ever was seen in this land betwixt two knights, for they</a>
<a id='line_16380'>fought more than two hours. And there they both bled so much blood that</a>
<a id='line_16381'>all men marvelled that ever they might endure it. And so at the last,</a>
<a id='line_16382'>by both their assents, they were made friends and sworn-brethren for</a>
<a id='line_16383'>ever, and no man can judge the better knight. And now is Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_16384'>made a knight of the Round Table, and he sitteth in the siege of the</a>
<a id='line_16385'>noble knight, Sir Marhaus. By my head, said Sir Palomides, Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_16386'>is far bigger than Sir Launcelot, and the hardier knight. Have ye</a>
<a id='line_16387'>assayed them both? said Sir Dinadan. I have seen Sir Tristram fight,</a>
<a id='line_16388'>said Sir Palomides, but never Sir Launcelot to my witting. But at the</a>
<a id='line_16389'>fountain where Sir Launcelot lay asleep, there with one spear he smote</a>
<a id='line_16390'>down Sir Tristram and me, said Palomides, but at that time they knew</a>
<a id='line_16391'>not either other. Fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, as for Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16392'>and Sir Tristram let them be, for the worst of them will not be lightly</a>
<a id='line_16393'>matched of no knights that I know living. No, said Sir Palomides, God</a>
<a id='line_16394'>defend, but an I had a quarrel to the better of them both I would with</a>
<a id='line_16395'>as good a will fight with him as with you. Sir, I require you tell me</a>
<a id='line_16396'>your name, and in good faith I shall hold you company till that we come</a>
<a id='line_16397'>to Camelot; and there shall ye have great worship now at this great</a>
<a id='line_16398'>tournament; for there shall be the Queen Guenever, and La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_16399'>of Cornwall. Wit you well, sir knight, for the love of La Beale Isoud I</a>
<a id='line_16400'>will be there, and else not, but I will not have ado in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_16401'>court. Sir, said Dinadan, I shall ride with you and do you service, so</a>
<a id='line_16402'>you will tell me your name. Sir, ye shall understand my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_16403'>Palomides, brother to Safere, the good and noble knight. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_16404'>Segwarides and I, we be Saracens born, of father and mother. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_16405'>Sir Dinadan, I thank you much for the telling of your name. For I am</a>
<a id='line_16406'>glad of that I know your name, and I promise you by the faith of my</a>
<a id='line_16407'>body, ye shall not be hurt by me by my will, but rather be advanced.</a>
<a id='line_16408'>And thereto will I help you with all my power, I promise you, doubt ye</a>
<a id='line_16409'>not. And certainly on my life ye shall win great worship in the court</a>
<a id='line_16410'>of King Arthur, and be right welcome. So then they dressed on their</a>
<a id='line_16411'>helms and put on their shields, and mounted upon their horses, and took</a>
<a id='line_16412'>the broad way towards Camelot. And then were they ware of a castle that</a>
<a id='line_16413'>was fair and rich, and also passing strong as any was within this</a>
<a id='line_16414'>realm.</a>

<a id='line_16421'></a>
<a id='line_16422'></a>
<a id='line_16423'>Sir Palomides, said Dinadan, here is a castle that I know well, and</a>
<a id='line_16424'>therein dwelleth Queen Morgan le Fay, King Arthur’s sister; and King</a>
<a id='line_16425'>Arthur gave her this castle, the which he hath repented him sithen a</a>
<a id='line_16426'>thousand times, for sithen King Arthur and she have been at debate and</a>
<a id='line_16427'>strife; but this castle could he never get nor win of her by no manner</a>
<a id='line_16428'>of engine; and ever as she might she made war on King Arthur. And all</a>
<a id='line_16429'>dangerous knights she withholdeth with her, for to destroy all these</a>
<a id='line_16430'>knights that King Arthur loveth. And there shall no knight pass this</a>
<a id='line_16431'>way but he must joust with one knight, or with two, or with three. And</a>
<a id='line_16432'>if it hap that King Arthur’s knight be beaten, he shall lose his horse</a>
<a id='line_16433'>and his harness and all that he hath, and hard, if that he escape, but</a>
<a id='line_16434'>that he shall be prisoner. So God me help, said Palomides, this is a</a>
<a id='line_16435'>shameful custom, and a villainous usance for a queen to use, and namely</a>
<a id='line_16436'>to make such war upon her own lord, that is called the Flower of</a>
<a id='line_16437'>Chivalry that is christian or heathen; and with all my heart I would</a>
<a id='line_16438'>destroy that shameful custom. And I will that all the world wit she</a>
<a id='line_16439'>shall have no service of me. And if she send out any knights, as I</a>
<a id='line_16440'>suppose she will, for to joust, they shall have both their hands full.</a>
<a id='line_16441'>And I shall not fail you, said Sir Dinadan, unto my puissance, upon my</a>
<a id='line_16442'>life.</a>
<a id='line_16443'></a>
<a id='line_16444'>So as they stood on horseback afore the castle, there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_16445'>with a red shield, and two squires after him; and he came straight unto</a>
<a id='line_16446'>Sir Palomides, the good knight, and said to him: Fair and gentle</a>
<a id='line_16447'>knight-errant, I require thee for the love thou owest unto knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_16448'>that ye will not have ado here with these men of this castle; for this</a>
<a id='line_16449'>was Sir Lamorak that thus said. For I came hither to seek this deed,</a>
<a id='line_16450'>and it is my request; and therefore I beseech you, knight, let me deal,</a>
<a id='line_16451'>and if I be beaten revenge me. In the name of God, said Palomides, let</a>
<a id='line_16452'>see how ye will speed, and we shall behold you. Then anon came forth a</a>
<a id='line_16453'>knight of the castle, and proffered to joust with the Knight with the</a>
<a id='line_16454'>Red Shield. Anon they encountered together, and he with the red shield</a>
<a id='line_16455'>smote him so hard that he bare him over to the earth. Therewith anon</a>
<a id='line_16456'>came another knight of the castle, and he was smitten so sore that he</a>
<a id='line_16457'>avoided his saddle. And forthwithal came the third knight, and the</a>
<a id='line_16458'>Knight with the Red Shield smote him to the earth. Then came Sir</a>
<a id='line_16459'>Palomides, and besought him that he might help him to joust. Fair</a>
<a id='line_16460'>knight, said he unto him, suffer me as at this time to have my will,</a>
<a id='line_16461'>for an they were twenty knights I shall not doubt them. And ever there</a>
<a id='line_16462'>were upon the walls of the castle many lords and ladies that cried and</a>
<a id='line_16463'>said: Well have ye jousted, Knight with the Red Shield. But as soon as</a>
<a id='line_16464'>the knight had smitten them down, his squire took their horses, and</a>
<a id='line_16465'>avoided their saddles and bridles of the horses, and turned them into</a>
<a id='line_16466'>the forest, and made the knights to be kept to the end of the jousts.</a>
<a id='line_16467'>Right so came out of the castle the fourth knight, and freshly</a>
<a id='line_16468'>proffered to joust with the Knight with the Red Shield: and he was</a>
<a id='line_16469'>ready, and he smote him so hard that horse and man fell to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_16470'>and the knight’s back brake with the fall, and his neck also. O Jesu,</a>
<a id='line_16471'>said Sir Palomides, that yonder is a passing good knight, and the best</a>
<a id='line_16472'>jouster that ever I saw. By my head, said Sir Dinadan, he is as good as</a>
<a id='line_16473'>ever was Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, what knight somever he be.</a>

<a id='line_16482'>Then forthwithal came a knight out of the castle, with a shield bended</a>

<a id='line_16484'>he encountered so hard that he smote the knight of the castle through</a>

<a id='line_16486'>Fair knight, said Sir Palomides, ye have overmuch on hand, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_16487'>pray you let me joust, for ye had need to be reposed. Why sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_16488'>knight, seem ye that I am weak and feeble? and sir, methinketh ye</a>
<a id='line_16489'>proffer me wrong, and to me shame, when I do well enough. I tell you</a>
<a id='line_16490'>now as I told you erst; for an they were twenty knights I shall beat</a>
<a id='line_16491'>them, and if I be beaten or slain then may ye revenge me. And if ye</a>
<a id='line_16492'>think that I be weary, and ye have an appetite to joust with me, I</a>
<a id='line_16493'>shall find you jousting enough. Sir, said Palomides, I said it not</a>
<a id='line_16494'>because I would joust with you, but meseemeth that ye have overmuch on</a>
<a id='line_16495'>hand. And therefore, an ye were gentle, said the Knight with the Red</a>
<a id='line_16496'>Shield, ye should not proffer me shame; therefore I require you to</a>
<a id='line_16497'>joust with me, and ye shall find that I am not weary. Sith ye require</a>
<a id='line_16498'>me, said Sir Palomides, take keep to yourself. Then they two knights</a>
<a id='line_16499'>came together as fast as their horses might run, and the knight smote</a>
<a id='line_16500'>Sir Palomides sore on the shield that the spear went into his side a</a>
<a id='line_16501'>great wound, and a perilous. And therewithal Sir Palomides avoided his</a>
<a id='line_16502'>saddle. And that knight turned unto Sir Dinadan; and when he saw him</a>
<a id='line_16503'>coming he cried aloud, and said: Sir, I will not have ado with you; but</a>
<a id='line_16504'>for that he let it not, but came straight upon him. So Sir Dinadan for</a>
<a id='line_16505'>shame put forth his spear and all to-shivered it upon the knight. But</a>
<a id='line_16506'>he smote Sir Dinadan again so hard that he smote him clean from his</a>
<a id='line_16507'>saddle; but their horses he would not suffer his squires to meddle</a>
<a id='line_16508'>with, and because they were knights-errant.</a>
<a id='line_16509'></a>
<a id='line_16510'>Then he dressed him again to the castle, and jousted with seven knights</a>
<a id='line_16511'>more, and there was none of them might withstand him, but he bare him</a>
<a id='line_16512'>to the earth. And of these twelve knights he slew in plain jousts four.</a>
<a id='line_16513'>And the eight knights he made them to swear on the cross of a sword</a>
<a id='line_16514'>that they should never use the evil customs of the castle. And when he</a>
<a id='line_16515'>had made them to swear that oath he let them pass. And ever stood the</a>
<a id='line_16516'>lords and the ladies on the castle walls crying and saying: Knight with</a>
<a id='line_16517'>the Red Shield, ye have marvellously well done as ever we saw knight</a>
<a id='line_16518'>do. And therewith came a knight out of the castle unarmed, and said:</a>
<a id='line_16519'>Knight with the Red Shield, overmuch damage hast thou done to us this</a>
<a id='line_16520'>day, therefore return whither thou wilt, for here are no more will have</a>
<a id='line_16521'>ado with thee; for we repent sore that ever thou camest here, for by</a>
<a id='line_16522'>thee is fordone the old custom of this castle. And with that word he</a>
<a id='line_16523'>turned again into the castle, and shut the gates. Then the Knight with</a>
<a id='line_16524'>the Red Shield turned and called his squires, and so passed forth on</a>
<a id='line_16525'>his way, and rode a great pace.</a>
<a id='line_16526'></a>
<a id='line_16527'>And when he was past Sir Palomides went to Sir Dinadan, and said: I had</a>
<a id='line_16528'>never such a shame of one knight that ever I met; and therefore I cast</a>
<a id='line_16529'>me to ride after him, and to be revenged with my sword, for a-horseback</a>
<a id='line_16530'>I deem I shall get no worship of him. Sir Palomides, said Dinadan, ye</a>
<a id='line_16531'>shall not meddle with him by my counsel, for ye shall get no worship of</a>
<a id='line_16532'>him; and for this cause, ye have seen him this day have had overmuch to</a>
<a id='line_16533'>do, and overmuch travailed. By almighty Jesu, said Palomides, I shall</a>
<a id='line_16534'>never be at ease till that I have had ado with him. Sir, said Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_16535'>I shall give you my beholding. Well, said Palomides, then shall ye see</a>
<a id='line_16536'>how we shall redress our mights. So they took their horses of their</a>
<a id='line_16537'>varlets, and rode after the Knight with the Red Shield; and down in a</a>
<a id='line_16538'>valley beside a fountain they were ware where he was alighted to repose</a>
<a id='line_16539'>him, and had done off his helm for to drink at the well.</a>
<a id='line_16540'></a>
<a id='line_16541'></a>
<a id='line_16542'></a>
<a id='line_16543'></a>
<a id='line_16544'>CHAPTER XIX. How Sir Lamorak jousted with Sir Palomides, and hurt him</a>
<a id='line_16545'>grievously.</a>
<a id='line_16546'></a>
<a id='line_16547'></a>
<a id='line_16548'>Then Palomides rode fast till he came nigh him. And then he said:</a>
<a id='line_16549'>Knight, remember ye of the shame ye did to me right now at the castle,</a>
<a id='line_16550'>therefore dress thee, for I will have ado with thee. Fair knight, said</a>
<a id='line_16551'>he to Palomides, of me ye win no worship, for ye have seen this day</a>
<a id='line_16552'>that I have been travailed sore. As for that, said Palomides, I will</a>
<a id='line_16553'>not let, for wit ye well I will be revenged. Well, said the knight, I</a>
<a id='line_16554'>may happen to endure you. And therewithal he mounted upon his horse,</a>
<a id='line_16555'>and took a great spear in his hand ready for to joust. Nay, said</a>
<a id='line_16556'>Palomides, I will not joust, for I am sure at jousting I get no prize.</a>
<a id='line_16557'>Fair knight, said that knight, it would beseem a knight to joust and to</a>
<a id='line_16558'>fight on horseback. Ye shall see what I will do, said Palomides. And</a>
<a id='line_16559'>therewith he alighted down upon foot, and dressed his shield afore him</a>
<a id='line_16560'>and pulled out his sword. Then the Knight with the Red Shield descended</a>
<a id='line_16561'>down from his horse, and dressed his shield afore him, and so he drew</a>
<a id='line_16562'>out his sword. And then they came together a soft pace, and wonderly</a>
<a id='line_16563'>they lashed together passing thick the mountenance of an hour or ever</a>
<a id='line_16564'>they breathed. Then they traced and traversed, and waxed wonderly</a>
<a id='line_16565'>wroth, and either behight other death; they hewed so fast with their</a>
<a id='line_16566'>swords that they cut in down half their swords and mails, that the bare</a>
<a id='line_16567'>flesh in some place stood above their harness. And when Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_16568'>beheld his fellow’s sword over-hylled with his blood it grieved him</a>
<a id='line_16569'>sore: some while they foined, some while they struck as wild men. But</a>
<a id='line_16570'>at the last Sir Palomides waxed faint, because of his first wound that</a>
<a id='line_16571'>he had at the castle with a spear, for that wound grieved him wonderly</a>
<a id='line_16572'>sore. Fair knight, said Palomides, meseemeth we have assayed either</a>
<a id='line_16573'>other passing sore, and if it may please thee, I require thee of thy</a>
<a id='line_16574'>knighthood tell me thy name. Sir, said the knight to Palomides, that is</a>
<a id='line_16575'>me loath to do, for thou hast done me wrong and no knighthood to</a>
<a id='line_16576'>proffer me battle, considering my great travail, but an thou wilt tell</a>
<a id='line_16577'>me thy name I will tell thee mine. Sir, said he, wit thou well my name</a>
<a id='line_16578'>is Palomides. Ah, sir, ye shall understand my name is Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_16579'>Galis, son and heir unto the good knight and king, King Pellinore, and</a>
<a id='line_16580'>Sir Tor, the good knight, is my half brother. When Sir Palomides heard</a>
<a id='line_16581'>him say so he kneeled down and asked mercy, For outrageously have I</a>
<a id='line_16582'>done to you this day; considering the great deeds of arms I have seen</a>
<a id='line_16583'>you do, shamefully and unknightly I have required you to do battle. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_16584'>Sir Palomides, said Sir Lamorak, overmuch have ye done and said to me.</a>
<a id='line_16585'>And therewith he embraced him with his both hands, and said: Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_16586'>the worthy knight, in all this land is no better than ye, nor more of</a>
<a id='line_16587'>prowess, and me repenteth sore that we should fight together. So it</a>
<a id='line_16588'>doth not me, said Sir Palomides, and yet am I sorer wounded than ye be;</a>
<a id='line_16589'>but as for that I shall soon thereof be whole. But certainly I would</a>
<a id='line_16590'>not for the fairest castle in this land, but if thou and I had met, for</a>
<a id='line_16591'>I shall love you the days of my life afore all other knights except my</a>
<a id='line_16592'>brother, Sir Safere. I say the same, said Sir Lamorak, except my</a>
<a id='line_16593'>brother, Sir Tor. Then came Sir Dinadan, and he made great joy of Sir</a>
<a id='line_16594'>Lamorak. Then their squires dressed both their shields and their</a>
<a id='line_16595'>harness, and stopped their wounds. And thereby at a priory they rested</a>
<a id='line_16596'>them all night.</a>
<a id='line_16597'></a>
<a id='line_16598'></a>
<a id='line_16599'></a>
<a id='line_16600'></a>
<a id='line_16601'>CHAPTER XX. How it was told Sir Launcelot that Dagonet chased King</a>
<a id='line_16602'>Mark, and how a knight overthrew him and six knights.</a>
<a id='line_16603'></a>
<a id='line_16604'></a>
<a id='line_16605'>Now turn we again. When Sir Ganis and Sir Brandiles with his fellows</a>
<a id='line_16606'>came to the court of King Arthur they told the king, Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_16607'>Sir Tristram, how Sir Dagonet, the fool, chased King Mark through the</a>
<a id='line_16608'>forest, and how the strong knight smote them down all seven with one</a>
<a id='line_16609'>spear. There was great laughing and japing at King Mark and at Sir</a>
<a id='line_16610'>Dagonet. But all these knights could not tell what knight it was that</a>
<a id='line_16611'>rescued King Mark. Then they asked King Mark if that he knew him, and</a>
<a id='line_16612'>he answered and said: He named himself the Knight that followed the</a>
<a id='line_16613'>Questing Beast, and on that name he sent one of my varlets to a place</a>
<a id='line_16614'>where was his mother; and when she heard from whence he came she made</a>
<a id='line_16615'>passing great dole, and discovered to my varlet his name, and said: Oh,</a>
<a id='line_16616'>my dear son, Sir Palomides, why wilt thou not see me? And therefore,</a>
<a id='line_16617'>sir, said King Mark, it is to understand his name is Sir Palomides, a</a>
<a id='line_16618'>noble knight. Then were all these seven knights glad that they knew his</a>
<a id='line_16619'>name.</a>
<a id='line_16620'></a>
<a id='line_16621'>Now turn we again, for on the morn they took their horses, both Sir</a>
<a id='line_16622'>Lamorak, Palomides, and Dinadan, with their squires and varlets, till</a>
<a id='line_16623'>they saw a fair castle that stood on a mountain well closed, and</a>
<a id='line_16624'>thither they rode, and there they found a knight that hight Galahalt,</a>
<a id='line_16625'>that was lord of that castle, and there they had great cheer and were</a>
<a id='line_16626'>well eased. Sir Dinadan, said Sir Lamorak, what will ye do? Oh sir,</a>
<a id='line_16627'>said Dinadan, I will to-morrow to the court of King Arthur. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_16628'>said Sir Palomides, I will not ride these three days, for I am sore</a>
<a id='line_16629'>hurt, and much have I bled, and therefore I will repose me here. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_16630'>said Sir Lamorak, and I will abide here with you; and when ye ride,</a>
<a id='line_16631'>then will I ride, unless that ye tarry over long; then will I take my</a>
<a id='line_16632'>horse. Therefore I pray you, Sir Dinadan, abide and ride with us.</a>
<a id='line_16633'>Faithfully, said Dinadan, I will not abide, for I have such a talent to</a>
<a id='line_16634'>see Sir Tristram that I may not abide long from him. Ah, Dinadan, said</a>
<a id='line_16635'>Sir Palomides, now do I understand that ye love my mortal enemy, and</a>
<a id='line_16636'>therefore how should I trust you. Well, said Dinadan, I love my lord</a>
<a id='line_16637'>Sir Tristram, above all other, and him will I serve and do honour. So</a>
<a id='line_16638'>shall I, said Sir Lamorak, in all that may lie in my power.</a>
<a id='line_16639'></a>
<a id='line_16640'>So on the morn Sir Dinadan rode unto the court of King Arthur; and by</a>
<a id='line_16641'>the way as he rode he saw where stood an errant knight, and made him</a>
<a id='line_16642'>ready for to joust. Not so, said Dinadan, for I have no will to joust.</a>
<a id='line_16643'>With me shall ye joust, said the knight, or that ye pass this way.</a>
<a id='line_16644'>Whether ask ye jousts, by love or by hate? The knight answered: Wit ye</a>
<a id='line_16645'>well I ask it for love, and not for hate. It may well be so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16646'>Dinadan, but ye proffer me hard love when ye will joust with me with a</a>
<a id='line_16647'>sharp spear. But, fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, sith ye will joust</a>
<a id='line_16648'>with me, meet with me in the court of King Arthur, and there shall I</a>
<a id='line_16649'>joust with you. Well, said the knight, sith ye will not joust with me,</a>
<a id='line_16650'>I pray you tell me your name. Sir knight, said he, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_16651'>Dinadan. Ah, said the knight, full well know I you for a good knight</a>
<a id='line_16652'>and a gentle, and wit you well I love you heartily. Then shall there be</a>
<a id='line_16653'>no jousts, said Dinadan, betwixt us. So they departed. And the same day</a>
<a id='line_16654'>he came to Camelot, where lay King Arthur. And there he saluted the</a>
<a id='line_16655'>king and the queen, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram; and all the court</a>
<a id='line_16656'>was glad of Sir Dinadan, for he was gentle, wise, and courteous, and a</a>
<a id='line_16657'>good knight. And in especial, the valiant knight Sir Tristram loved Sir</a>
<a id='line_16658'>Dinadan passing well above all other knights save Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_16659'></a>
<a id='line_16660'>Then the king asked Sir Dinadan what adventures he had seen. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_16661'>Dinadan, I have seen many adventures, and of some King Mark knoweth,</a>
<a id='line_16662'>but not all. Then the king hearkened Sir Dinadan, how he told that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16663'>Palomides and he were afore the castle of Morgan le Fay, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_16664'>Lamorak took the jousts afore them, and how he forjousted twelve</a>
<a id='line_16665'>knights, and of them four he slew, and how after he smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_16666'>Palomides and me both. t I may not believe that, said the king, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_16667'>Palomides is a passing good knight. That is very truth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16668'>Dinadan, but yet I saw him better proved, hand for hand. And then he</a>
<a id='line_16669'>told the king all that battle, and how Sir Palomides was more weaker,</a>
<a id='line_16670'>and more hurt, and more lost of his blood. And without doubt, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16671'>Dinadan, had the battle longer lasted, Palomides had been slain. O</a>
<a id='line_16672'>Jesu, said King Arthur, this is to me a great marvel. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_16673'>Tristram, marvel ye nothing thereof, for at mine advice there is not a</a>
<a id='line_16674'>valianter knight in the world living, for I know his might. And now I</a>
<a id='line_16675'>will say you, I was never so weary of knight but if it were Sir</a>
<a id='line_16676'>Launcelot. And there is no knight in the world except Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16677'>that did so well as Sir Lamorak. So God me help, said the king, I would</a>
<a id='line_16678'>that knight, Sir Lamorak, came to this Court. Sir, said Dinadan, he</a>
<a id='line_16679'>will be here in short space, and Sir Palomides both, but I fear that</a>
<a id='line_16680'>Palomides may not yet travel.</a>

<a id='line_16685'>CHAPTER XXI. How King Arthur let do cry a jousts, and how Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_16686'>came in, and overthrew Sir Gawaine and many other.</a>
<a id='line_16687'></a>
<a id='line_16688'></a>
<a id='line_16689'>Then within three days after the king let make a jousting at a priory.</a>
<a id='line_16690'>And there made them ready many knights of the Round Table, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_16691'>Gawaine and his brethren made them ready to joust; but Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_16692'>Launcelot, nor Dinadan, would not joust, but suffered Sir Gawaine, for</a>
<a id='line_16693'>the love of King Arthur, with his brethren, to win the gree if they</a>
<a id='line_16694'>might. Then on the morn they apparelled them to joust, Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_16695'>his four brethren, and did there great deeds of arms. And Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_16696'>Maris did marvellously well, but Sir Gawaine passed all that</a>
<a id='line_16697'>fellowship; wherefore King Arthur and all the knights gave Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_16698'>the honour at the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_16699'></a>
<a id='line_16700'>Right so King Arthur was ware of a knight and two squires, the which</a>
<a id='line_16701'>came out of a forest side, with a shield covered with leather, and then</a>
<a id='line_16702'>he came slyly and hurtled here and there, and anon with one spear he</a>
<a id='line_16703'>had smitten down two knights of the Round Table. Then with his hurtling</a>
<a id='line_16704'>he lost the covering of his shield, then was the king and all other</a>
<a id='line_16705'>ware that he bare a red shield. O Jesu, said King Arthur, see where</a>
<a id='line_16706'>rideth a stout knight, he with the red shield. And there was noise and</a>
<a id='line_16707'>crying: Beware the Knight with the Red Shield. So within a little while</a>
<a id='line_16708'>he had overthrown three brethren of Sir Gawaine’s. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_16709'>King Arthur, meseemeth yonder is the best jouster that ever I saw. With</a>
<a id='line_16710'>that he saw him encounter with Sir Gawaine, and he smote him down with</a>
<a id='line_16711'>so great force that he made his horse to avoid his saddle. How now,</a>
<a id='line_16712'>said the king, Sir Gawaine hath a fall; well were me an I knew what</a>
<a id='line_16713'>knight he were with the red shield. I know him well, said Dinadan, but</a>
<a id='line_16714'>as at this time ye shall not know his name. By my head, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16715'>Tristram, he jousted better than Sir Palomides, and if ye list to know</a>
<a id='line_16716'>his name, wit ye well his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.</a>
<a id='line_16717'></a>
<a id='line_16718'>As they stood thus talking, Sir Gawaine and he encountered together</a>
<a id='line_16719'>again, and there he smote Sir Gawaine from his horse, and bruised him</a>
<a id='line_16720'>sore. And in the sight of King Arthur he smote down twenty knights,</a>
<a id='line_16721'>beside Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And so clearly was the prize given</a>
<a id='line_16722'>him as a knight peerless. Then slyly and marvellously Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_16723'>withdrew him from all the fellowship into the forest side. All this</a>
<a id='line_16724'>espied King Arthur, for his eye went never from him. Then the king, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16725'>Launcelot, Sir Tristram, and Sir Dinadan, took their hackneys, and rode</a>
<a id='line_16726'>straight after the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and there found</a>
<a id='line_16727'>him. And thus said the king: Ah, fair knight, well be ye found. When he</a>
<a id='line_16728'>saw the king he put off his helm and saluted him, and when he saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_16729'>Tristram he alighted down off his horse and ran to him to take him by</a>
<a id='line_16730'>the thighs, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him, but he alighted or</a>
<a id='line_16731'>that he came, and either took other in arms, and made great joy of</a>
<a id='line_16732'>other. The king was glad, and also was all the fellowship of the Round</a>
<a id='line_16733'>Table, except Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And when they wist that he</a>
<a id='line_16734'>was Sir Lamorak, they had great despite at him, and were wonderly wroth</a>
<a id='line_16735'>with him that he had put him to dishonour that day.</a>
<a id='line_16736'></a>
<a id='line_16737'>Then Gawaine called privily in council all his brethren, and to them</a>
<a id='line_16738'>said thus: Fair brethren, here may ye see, whom that we hate King</a>
<a id='line_16739'>Arthur loveth, and whom that we love he hateth. And wit ye well, my</a>
<a id='line_16740'>fair brethren, that this Sir Lamorak will never love us, because we</a>
<a id='line_16741'>slew his father, King Pellinore, for we deemed that he slew our father,</a>
<a id='line_16742'>King of Orkney. And for the despite of Pellinore, Sir Lamorak did us a</a>
<a id='line_16743'>shame to our mother, therefore I will be revenged. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16744'>Gawaine’s brethren, let see how ye will or may be revenged, and ye</a>
<a id='line_16745'>shall find us ready. Well, said Gawaine, hold you still and we shall</a>

<a id='line_16756'>Arthur, that on a day said unto King Mark: Sir, I pray you give me a</a>
<a id='line_16757'>gift that I shall ask you. Sir, said King Mark, I will give you</a>
<a id='line_16758'>whatsomever ye desire an it be in my power. Sir, gramercy, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_16759'>This I will ask you, that ye will be good lord unto Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_16760'>he is a man of great honour; and that ye will take him with you into</a>
<a id='line_16761'>Cornwall, and let him see his friends, and there cherish him for my</a>
<a id='line_16762'>sake. Sir, said King Mark, I promise you by the faith of my body, and</a>
<a id='line_16763'>by the faith that I owe to God and to you, I shall worship him for your</a>
<a id='line_16764'>sake in all that I can or may. Sir, said Arthur, and I will forgive you</a>
<a id='line_16765'>all the evil will that ever I ought you, an so be that you swear that</a>
<a id='line_16766'>upon a book before me. With a good will, said King Mark; and so he</a>
<a id='line_16767'>there sware upon a book afore him and all his knights, and therewith</a>
<a id='line_16768'>King Mark and Sir Tristram took either other by the hands hard knit</a>
<a id='line_16769'>together. But for all this King Mark thought falsely, as it proved</a>
<a id='line_16770'>after, for he put Sir Tristram in prison, and cowardly would have slain</a>
<a id='line_16771'>him.</a>
<a id='line_16772'></a>
<a id='line_16773'>Then soon after King Mark took his leave to ride into Cornwall, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16774'>Tristram made him ready to ride with him, whereof the most part of the</a>
<a id='line_16775'>Round Table were wroth and heavy, and in especial Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_16776'>Sir Lamorak, and Sir Dinadan, were wroth out of measure. For well they</a>
<a id='line_16777'>wist King Mark would slay or destroy Sir Tristram. Alas, said Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_16778'>that my lord, Sir Tristram, shall depart. And Sir Tristram took such</a>
<a id='line_16779'>sorrow that he was amazed like a fool. Alas, said Sir Launcelot unto</a>
<a id='line_16780'>King Arthur, what have ye done, for ye shall lose the most man of</a>
<a id='line_16781'>worship that ever came into your court. It was his own desire, said</a>
<a id='line_16782'>Arthur, and therefore I might not do withal, for I have done all that I</a>
<a id='line_16783'>can and made them at accord. Accord, said Sir Launcelot, fie upon that</a>
<a id='line_16784'>accord, for ye shall hear that he shall slay Sir Tristram, or put him</a>
<a id='line_16785'>in a prison, for he is the most coward and the villainest king and</a>
<a id='line_16786'>knight that is now living.</a>
<a id='line_16787'></a>
<a id='line_16788'>And therewith Sir Launcelot departed, and came to King Mark, and said</a>
<a id='line_16789'>to him thus: Sir king, wit thou well the good knight Sir Tristram shall</a>
<a id='line_16790'>go with thee. Beware, I rede thee, of treason, for an thou mischief</a>
<a id='line_16791'>that knight by any manner of falsehood or treason, by the faith I owe</a>
<a id='line_16792'>to God and to the order of knighthood, I shall slay thee with mine own</a>
<a id='line_16793'>hands. Sir Launcelot, said the king, overmuch have ye said to me, and I</a>
<a id='line_16794'>have sworn and said over largely afore King Arthur in hearing of all</a>
<a id='line_16795'>his knights, that I shall not slay nor betray him. It were to me</a>
<a id='line_16796'>overmuch shame to break my promise. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16797'>but ye are called so false and full of treason that no man may believe</a>
<a id='line_16798'>you. Forsooth it is known well wherefore ye came into this country, and</a>
<a id='line_16799'>for none other cause but for to slay Sir Tristram. So with great dole</a>
<a id='line_16800'>King Mark and Sir Tristram rode together, for it was by Sir Tristram’s</a>
<a id='line_16801'>will and his means to go with King Mark, and all was for the intent to</a>
<a id='line_16802'>see La Beale Isoud, for without the sight of her Sir Tristram might not</a>
<a id='line_16803'>endure.</a>

<a id='line_16808'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Percivale was made knight of King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_16809'>how a dumb maid spake, and brought him to the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_16810'></a>
<a id='line_16811'></a>
<a id='line_16812'>Now turn we again unto Sir Lamorak, and speak we of his brethren, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16813'>Tor, which was King Pellinore’s first son and begotten of Aryes, wife</a>
<a id='line_16814'>of the cowherd, for he was a bastard; and Sir Aglovale was his first</a>
<a id='line_16815'>son begotten in wedlock; Sir Lamorak, Dornar, Percivale, these were his</a>
<a id='line_16816'>sons too in wedlock. So when King Mark and Sir Tristram were departed</a>
<a id='line_16817'>from the court there was made great dole and sorrow for the departing</a>
<a id='line_16818'>of Sir Tristram. Then the king and his knights made no manner of joys</a>
<a id='line_16819'>eight days after. And at the eight days’ end there came to the court a</a>
<a id='line_16820'>knight with a young squire with him. And when this knight was unarmed,</a>
<a id='line_16821'>he went to the king and required him to make the young squire a knight.</a>
<a id='line_16822'>Of what lineage is he come? said King Arthur. Sir, said the knight, he</a>
<a id='line_16823'>is the son of King Pellinore, that did you some time good service, and</a>
<a id='line_16824'>he is a brother unto Sir Lamorak de Galis, the good knight. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_16825'>the king, for what cause desire ye that of me that I should make him</a>
<a id='line_16826'>knight? Wit you well, my lord the king, that this young squire is</a>
<a id='line_16827'>brother to me as well as to Sir Lamorak, and my name is Aglavale. Sir</a>
<a id='line_16828'>Aglavale, said Arthur, for the love of Sir Lamorak, and for his</a>
<a id='line_16829'>father’s love, he shall be made knight to-morrow. Now tell me, said</a>
<a id='line_16830'>Arthur, what is his name? Sir, said the knight, his name is Percivale</a>
<a id='line_16831'>de Galis. So on the morn the king made him knight in Camelot. But the</a>
<a id='line_16832'>king and all the knights thought it would be long or that he proved a</a>
<a id='line_16833'>good knight.</a>
<a id='line_16834'></a>
<a id='line_16835'>Then at the dinner, when the king was set at the table, and every</a>
<a id='line_16836'>knight after he was of prowess, the king commanded him to be set among</a>
<a id='line_16837'>mean knights; and so was Sir Percivale set as the king commanded. Then</a>
<a id='line_16838'>was there a maiden in the queen’s court that was come of high blood,</a>
<a id='line_16839'>and she was dumb and never spake word. Right so she came straight into</a>
<a id='line_16840'>the hall, and went unto Sir Percivale, and took him by the hand and</a>
<a id='line_16841'>said aloud, that the king and all the knights might hear it: Arise, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16842'>Percivale, the noble knight and God’s knight, and go with me; and so he</a>
<a id='line_16843'>did. And there she brought him to the right side of the Siege Perilous,</a>
<a id='line_16844'>and said, Fair knight, take here thy siege, for that siege appertaineth</a>
<a id='line_16845'>to thee and to none other. Right so she departed and asked a priest.</a>
<a id='line_16846'>And as she was confessed and houselled then she died. Then the king and</a>
<a id='line_16847'>all the court made great joy of Sir Percivale.</a>

<a id='line_16852'>CHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Lamorak visited King Lot’s wife, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_16853'>Gaheris slew her which was his own mother.</a>
<a id='line_16854'></a>
<a id='line_16855'></a>
<a id='line_16856'>Now turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that much was there praised. Then, by the</a>
<a id='line_16857'>mean of Sir Gawaine and his brethren, they sent for their mother there</a>
<a id='line_16858'>besides, fast by a castle beside Camelot; and all was to that intent to</a>
<a id='line_16859'>slay Sir Lamorak. The Queen of Orkney was there but a while, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_16860'>Lamorak wist of their being, and was full fain; and for to make an end</a>
<a id='line_16861'>of this matter, he sent unto her, and there betwixt them was a night</a>
<a id='line_16862'>assigned that Sir Lamorak should come to her. Thereof was ware Sir</a>
<a id='line_16863'>Gaheris, and there he rode afore the same night, and waited upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_16864'>Lamorak, and then he saw where he came all armed. And where Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_16865'>alighted he tied his horse to a privy postern, and so he went into a</a>
<a id='line_16866'>parlour and unarmed him; and then he went unto the queen’s bed, and she</a>
<a id='line_16867'>made of him passing great joy, and he of her again, for either loved</a>
<a id='line_16868'>other passing sore. So when the knight, Sir Gaheris, saw his time, he</a>
<a id='line_16869'>came to their bedside all armed, with his sword naked, and suddenly gat</a>
<a id='line_16870'>his mother by the hair and struck off her head.</a>
<a id='line_16871'></a>
<a id='line_16872'>When Sir Lamorak saw the blood dash upon him all hot, the which he</a>
<a id='line_16873'>loved passing well, wit you well he was sore abashed and dismayed of</a>
<a id='line_16874'>that dolorous knight. And therewithal, Sir Lamorak leapt out of the bed</a>
<a id='line_16875'>in his shirt as a knight dismayed, saying thus: Ah, Sir Gaheris, knight</a>
<a id='line_16876'>of the Table Round, foul and evil have ye done, and to you great shame.</a>
<a id='line_16877'>Alas, why have ye slain your mother that bare you? with more right ye</a>
<a id='line_16878'>should have slain me. The offence hast thou done, said Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_16879'>notwithstanding a man is born to offer his service; but yet shouldst</a>
<a id='line_16880'>thou beware with whom thou meddlest, for thou hast put me and my</a>
<a id='line_16881'>brethren to a shame, and thy father slew our father; and thou to lie by</a>
<a id='line_16882'>our mother is too much shame for us to suffer. And as for thy father,</a>
<a id='line_16883'>King Pellinore, my brother Sir Gawaine and I slew him. Ye did him the</a>
<a id='line_16884'>more wrong, said Sir Lamorak, for my father slew not your father, it</a>
<a id='line_16885'>was Balin le Savage: and as yet my father’s death is not revenged.</a>
<a id='line_16886'>Leave those words, said Sir Gaheris, for an thou speak feloniously I</a>
<a id='line_16887'>will slay thee. But because thou art naked I am ashamed to slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_16888'>But wit thou well, in what place I may get thee I shall slay thee; and</a>
<a id='line_16889'>now my mother is quit of thee; and withdraw thee and take thine armour,</a>
<a id='line_16890'>that thou were gone. Sir Lamorak saw there was none other bote, but</a>
<a id='line_16891'>fast armed him, and took his horse and rode his way making great</a>
<a id='line_16892'>sorrow. But for the shame and dolour he would not ride to King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_16893'>court, but rode another way.</a>
<a id='line_16894'></a>
<a id='line_16895'>But when it was known that Gaheris had slain his mother the king was</a>
<a id='line_16896'>passing wroth, and commanded him to go out of his court. Wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_16897'>Sir Gawaine was wroth that Gaheris had slain his mother and let Sir</a>
<a id='line_16898'>Lamorak escape. And for this matter was the king passing wroth, and so</a>
<a id='line_16899'>was Sir Launcelot, and many other knights. Sir, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16900'>here is a great mischief befallen by felony, and by forecast treason,</a>
<a id='line_16901'>that your sister is thus shamefully slain. And I dare say that it was</a>
<a id='line_16902'>wrought by treason, and I dare say ye shall lose that good knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16903'>Lamorak, the which is great pity. I wot well and am sure, an Sir</a>
<a id='line_16904'>Tristram wist it, he would never more come within your court, the which</a>
<a id='line_16905'>should grieve you much more and all your knights. God defend, said the</a>
<a id='line_16906'>noble King Arthur, that I should lose Sir Lamorak or Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_16907'>then twain of my chief knights of the Table Round were gone. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_16908'>Sir Launcelot, I am sure ye shall lose Sir Lamorak, for Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_16909'>his brethren will slay him by one mean or other; for they among them</a>
<a id='line_16910'>have concluded and sworn to slay him an ever they may see their time.</a>
<a id='line_16911'>That shall I let, said Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_16917'>fleeing, and how they both were overthrown, and of Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_16918'></a>
<a id='line_16919'></a>
<a id='line_16920'>Now leave we of Sir Lamorak, and speak of Sir Gawaine’s brethren, and</a>
<a id='line_16921'>specially of Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred. As they rode on their</a>
<a id='line_16922'>adventures they met with a knight fleeing, sore wounded; and they asked</a>
<a id='line_16923'>him what tidings. Fair knights, said he, here cometh a knight after me</a>
<a id='line_16924'>that will slay me. With that came Sir Dinadan riding to them by</a>
<a id='line_16925'>adventure, but he would promise them no help. But Sir Agravaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16926'>Mordred promised him to rescue him. Therewithal came that knight</a>
<a id='line_16927'>straight unto them, and anon he proffered to joust. That saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_16928'>Mordred and rode to him, but he struck Mordred over his horse’s tail.</a>
<a id='line_16929'>That saw Sir Agravaine, and straight he rode toward that knight, and</a>
<a id='line_16930'>right so as he served Mordred so he served Agravaine, and said to them:</a>
<a id='line_16931'>Sirs, wit ye well both that I am Breuse Saunce Pité, that hath done</a>
<a id='line_16932'>this to you. And yet he rode over Agravaine five or six times. When</a>
<a id='line_16933'>Dinadan saw this, he must needs joust with him for shame. And so</a>
<a id='line_16934'>Dinadan and he encountered together, that with pure strength Sir</a>
<a id='line_16935'>Dinadan smote him over his horse’s tail. Then he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_16936'>fled, for he was on foot one of the valiantest knights in Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_16937'>days, and a great destroyer of all good knights.</a>
<a id='line_16938'></a>
<a id='line_16939'>Then rode Sir Dinadan unto Sir Mordred and unto Sir Agravaine. Sir</a>
<a id='line_16940'>knight, said they all, well have ye done, and well have ye revenged us,</a>
<a id='line_16941'>wherefore we pray you tell us your name. Fair sirs, ye ought to know my</a>
<a id='line_16942'>name, the which is called Sir Dinadan. When they understood that it was</a>
<a id='line_16943'>Dinadan they were more wroth than they were before, for they hated him</a>
<a id='line_16944'>out of measure because of Sir Lamorak. For Dinadan had such a custom</a>
<a id='line_16945'>that he loved all good knights that were valiant, and he hated all</a>
<a id='line_16946'>those that were destroyers of good knights. And there were none that</a>
<a id='line_16947'>hated Dinadan but those that ever were called murderers. Then spake the</a>
<a id='line_16948'>hurt knight that Breuse Saunce Pité had chased, his name was Dalan, and</a>
<a id='line_16949'>said: If thou be Dinadan thou slewest my father. It may well be so,</a>
<a id='line_16950'>said Dinadan, but then it was in my defence and at his request. By my</a>
<a id='line_16951'>head, said Dalan, thou shalt die therefore, and therewith he dressed</a>
<a id='line_16952'>his spear and his shield. And to make the shorter tale, Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_16953'>smote him down off his horse, that his neck was nigh broken. And in the</a>
<a id='line_16954'>same wise he smote Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine. And after, in the</a>
<a id='line_16955'>quest of the Sangreal, cowardly and feloniously they slew Dinadan, the</a>
<a id='line_16956'>which was great damage, for he was a great bourder and a passing good</a>
<a id='line_16957'>knight.</a>
<a id='line_16958'></a>
<a id='line_16959'>And so Sir Dinadan rode to a castle that hight Beale-Valet. And there</a>
<a id='line_16960'>he found Sir Palomides that was not yet whole of the wound that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16961'>Lamorak gave him. And there Dinadan told Palomides all the tidings that</a>
<a id='line_16962'>he heard and saw of Sir Tristram, and how he was gone with King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_16963'>and with him he hath all his will and desire. Therewith Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_16964'>waxed wroth, for he loved La Beale Isoud. And then he wist well that</a>
<a id='line_16965'>Sir Tristram enjoyed her.</a>

<a id='line_16971'>letters out of Cornwall, and of the answer again.</a>
<a id='line_16972'></a>
<a id='line_16973'></a>
<a id='line_16974'>Now leave we Sir Palomides and Sir Dinadan in the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_16975'>Beale-Valet, and turn we again unto King Arthur. There came a knight</a>
<a id='line_16976'>out of Cornwall, his name was Fergus, a fellow of the Round Table. And</a>
<a id='line_16977'>there he told the king and Sir Launcelot good tidings of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_16978'>and there were brought goodly letters, and how he left him in the</a>
<a id='line_16979'>castle of Tintagil. Then came the damosel that brought goodly letters</a>
<a id='line_16980'>unto King Arthur and unto Sir Launcelot, and there she had passing good</a>
<a id='line_16981'>cheer of the king, and of the Queen Guenever, and of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_16982'>Then they wrote goodly letters again. But Sir Launcelot bade ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_16983'>Tristram beware of King Mark, for ever he called him in his letters</a>
<a id='line_16984'>King Fox, as who saith, he fareth all with wiles and treason. Whereof</a>
<a id='line_16985'>Sir Tristram in his heart thanked Sir Launcelot. Then the damosel went</a>
<a id='line_16986'>unto La Beale Isoud, and bare her letters from the king and from Sir</a>
<a id='line_16987'>Launcelot, whereof she was in passing great joy. Fair damosel, said La</a>
<a id='line_16988'>Beale Isoud, how fareth my Lord Arthur, and the Queen Guenever, and the</a>
<a id='line_16989'>noble knight, Sir Launcelot? She answered, and to make short tale: Much</a>
<a id='line_16990'>the better that ye and Sir Tristram be in joy. God reward them, said La</a>
<a id='line_16991'>Beale Isoud, for Sir Tristram suffereth great pain for me, and I for</a>
<a id='line_16992'>him.</a>
<a id='line_16993'></a>
<a id='line_16994'>So the damosel departed, and brought letters to King Mark. And when he</a>
<a id='line_16995'>had read them, and understood them, he was wroth with Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_16996'>he deemed that he had sent the damosel unto King Arthur. For Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_16997'>Launcelot in a manner threated King Mark. And as King Mark read these</a>
<a id='line_16998'>letters he deemed treason by Sir Tristram. Damosel, said King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_16999'>will ye ride again and bear letters from me unto King Arthur? Sir, she</a>
<a id='line_17000'>said, I will be at your commandment to ride when ye will. Ye say well,</a>
<a id='line_17001'>said the king; come again, said the king, to-morn, and fetch your</a>
<a id='line_17002'>letters. Then she departed and told them how she should ride again with</a>
<a id='line_17003'>letters unto Arthur. Then we pray you, said La Beale Isoud and Sir</a>
<a id='line_17004'>Tristram, that when ye have received your letters, that ye would come</a>
<a id='line_17005'>by us that we may see the privity of your letters. All that I may do,</a>
<a id='line_17006'>madam, ye wot well I must do for Sir Tristram, for I have been long his</a>
<a id='line_17007'>own maiden.</a>
<a id='line_17008'></a>
<a id='line_17009'>So on the morn the damosel went to King Mark to have had his letters</a>
<a id='line_17010'>and to depart. I am not avised, said King Mark, as at this time to send</a>
<a id='line_17011'>my letters. Then privily and secretly he sent letters unto King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_17012'>and unto Queen Guenever, and unto Sir Launcelot. So the varlet</a>
<a id='line_17013'>departed, and found the king and the queen in Wales, at Carlion. And as</a>
<a id='line_17014'>the king and the queen were at mass the varlet came with the letters.</a>
<a id='line_17015'>And when mass was done the king and the queen opened the letters</a>
<a id='line_17016'>privily by themself. And the beginning of the king’s letters spake</a>
<a id='line_17017'>wonderly short unto King Arthur, and bade him entermete with himself</a>
<a id='line_17018'>and with his wife, and of his knights; for he was able enough to rule</a>
<a id='line_17019'>and keep his wife.</a>

<a id='line_17024'>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Launcelot was wroth with the letter that he</a>
<a id='line_17025'>received from King Mark, and of Dinadan which made a lay of King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_17026'></a>
<a id='line_17027'></a>
<a id='line_17028'>When King Arthur understood the letter, he mused of many things, and</a>
<a id='line_17029'>thought on his sister’s words, Queen Morgan le Fay, that she had said</a>
<a id='line_17030'>betwixt Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot. And in this thought he</a>
<a id='line_17031'>studied a great while. Then he bethought him again how his sister was</a>
<a id='line_17032'>his own enemy, and that she hated the queen and Sir Launcelot, and so</a>
<a id='line_17033'>he put all that out of his thought. Then King Arthur read the letter</a>
<a id='line_17034'>again, and the latter clause said that King Mark took Sir Tristram for</a>
<a id='line_17035'>his mortal enemy; wherefore he put Arthur out of doubt he would be</a>
<a id='line_17036'>revenged of Sir Tristram. Then was King Arthur wroth with King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_17037'>And when Queen Guenever read her letter and understood it, she was</a>
<a id='line_17038'>wroth out of measure, for the letter spake shame by her and by Sir</a>
<a id='line_17039'>Launcelot. And so privily she sent the letter unto Sir Launcelot. And</a>
<a id='line_17040'>when he wist the intent of the letter he was so wroth that he laid him</a>
<a id='line_17041'>down on his bed to sleep, whereof Sir Dinadan was ware, for it was his</a>
<a id='line_17042'>manner to be privy with all good knights. And as Sir Launcelot slept he</a>
<a id='line_17043'>stole the letter out of his hand, and read it word by word. And then he</a>
<a id='line_17044'>made great sorrow for anger. And so Sir Launcelot awaked, and went to a</a>
<a id='line_17045'>window, and read the letter again, the which made him angry.</a>
<a id='line_17046'></a>
<a id='line_17047'>Sir, said Dinadan, wherefore be ye angry? discover your heart to me:</a>
<a id='line_17048'>forsooth ye wot well I owe you good will, howbeit I am a poor knight</a>
<a id='line_17049'>and a servitor unto you and to all good knights. For though I be not of</a>
<a id='line_17050'>worship myself I love all those that be of worship. It is truth, said</a>
<a id='line_17051'>Sir Launcelot, ye are a trusty knight, and for great trust I will shew</a>
<a id='line_17052'>you my counsel. And when Dinadan understood all, he said: This is my</a>
<a id='line_17053'>counsel: set you right nought by these threats, for King Mark is so</a>
<a id='line_17054'>villainous, that by fair speech shall never man get of him. But ye</a>
<a id='line_17055'>shall see what I shall do; I will make a lay for him, and when it is</a>
<a id='line_17056'>made I shall make an harper to sing it afore him. So anon he went and</a>
<a id='line_17057'>made it, and taught it an harper that hight Eliot. And when he could</a>
<a id='line_17058'>it, he taught it to many harpers. And so by the will of Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_17059'>and of Arthur, the harpers went straight into Wales, and into Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_17060'>to sing the lay that Sir Dinadan made by King Mark, the which was the</a>
<a id='line_17061'>worst lay that ever harper sang with harp or with any other</a>
<a id='line_17062'>instruments.</a>

<a id='line_17067'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Tristram was hurt, and of a war made to King</a>
<a id='line_17068'>Mark; and of Sir Tristram how he promised to rescue him.</a>
<a id='line_17069'></a>
<a id='line_17070'></a>
<a id='line_17071'>Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram and to King Mark. As Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_17072'>was at jousts and at tournament it fortuned he was sore hurt both with</a>
<a id='line_17073'>a spear and with a sword, but yet he won always the degree. And for to</a>
<a id='line_17074'>repose him he went to a good knight that dwelled in Cornwall, in a</a>
<a id='line_17075'>castle, whose name was Sir Dinas le Seneschal. Then by misfortune there</a>
<a id='line_17076'>came out of Sessoin a great number of men of arms, and an hideous host,</a>
<a id='line_17077'>and they entered nigh the Castle of Tintagil; and their captain’s name</a>
<a id='line_17078'>was Elias, a good man of arms. When King Mark understood his enemies</a>
<a id='line_17079'>were entered into his land he made great dole and sorrow, for in no</a>
<a id='line_17080'>wise by his will King Mark would not send for Sir Tristram, for he</a>
<a id='line_17081'>hated him deadly.</a>
<a id='line_17082'></a>
<a id='line_17083'>So when his council was come they devised and cast many perils of the</a>
<a id='line_17084'>strength of their enemies. And then they concluded all at once, and</a>
<a id='line_17085'>said thus unto King Mark: Sir, wit ye well ye must send for Sir</a>
<a id='line_17086'>Tristram, the good knight, or else they will never be overcome. For by</a>
<a id='line_17087'>Sir Tristram they must be foughten withal, or else we row against the</a>
<a id='line_17088'>stream. Well, said King Mark, I will do by your counsel; but yet he was</a>
<a id='line_17089'>full loath thereto, but need constrained him to send for him. Then was</a>
<a id='line_17090'>he sent for in all haste that might be, that he should come to King</a>
<a id='line_17091'>Mark. And when he understood that King Mark had sent for him, he</a>
<a id='line_17092'>mounted upon a soft ambler and rode to King Mark. And when he was come</a>
<a id='line_17093'>the king said thus: Fair nephew Sir Tristram, this is all. Here be come</a>
<a id='line_17094'>our enemies of Sessoin, that are here nigh hand, and without tarrying</a>
<a id='line_17095'>they must be met with shortly, or else they will destroy this country.</a>
<a id='line_17096'>Sir, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well all my power is at your</a>
<a id='line_17097'>commandment. And wit ye well, sir, these eight days I may bear none</a>
<a id='line_17098'>arms, for my wounds be not yet whole. And by that day I shall do what I</a>
<a id='line_17099'>may. Ye say well, said King Mark; then go ye again and repose you and</a>
<a id='line_17100'>make you fresh, and I shall go and meet the Sessoins with all my power.</a>
<a id='line_17101'></a>
<a id='line_17102'>So the king departed unto Tintagil, and Sir Tristram went to repose</a>
<a id='line_17103'>him. And the king made a great host and departed them in three; the</a>
<a id='line_17104'>first part led Sir Dinas the Seneschal, and Sir Andred led the second</a>
<a id='line_17105'>part, and Sir Argius led the third part; and he was of the blood of</a>
<a id='line_17106'>King Mark. And the Sessoins had three great battles, and many good men</a>
<a id='line_17107'>of arms. And so King Mark by the advice of his knights issued out of</a>
<a id='line_17108'>the Castle of Tintagil upon his enemies. And Dinas, the good knight,</a>
<a id='line_17109'>rode out afore, and slew two knights with his own hands, and then began</a>
<a id='line_17110'>the battles. And there was marvellous breaking of spears and smiting of</a>
<a id='line_17111'>swords, and slew down many good knights. And ever was Sir Dinas the</a>
<a id='line_17112'>Seneschal the best of King Mark’s party. And thus the battle endured</a>
<a id='line_17113'>long with great mortality. But at the last King Mark and Sir Dinas,</a>
<a id='line_17114'>were they never so loath, they withdrew them to the Castle of Tintagil</a>
<a id='line_17115'>with great slaughter of people; and the Sessoins followed on fast, that</a>
<a id='line_17116'>ten of them were put within the gates and four slain with the</a>
<a id='line_17117'>portcullis.</a>
<a id='line_17118'></a>
<a id='line_17119'>Then King Mark sent for Sir Tristram by a varlet, that told him all the</a>
<a id='line_17120'>mortality. Then he sent the varlet again, and bade him: Tell King Mark</a>
<a id='line_17121'>that I will come as soon as I am whole, for erst I may do him no good.</a>
<a id='line_17122'>Then King Mark had his answer. Therewith came Elias and bade the king</a>
<a id='line_17123'>yield up the castle: For ye may not hold it no while. Sir Elias, said</a>
<a id='line_17124'>the king, so will I yield up the castle if I be not soon rescued. Anon</a>
<a id='line_17125'>King Mark sent again for rescue to Sir Tristram. By then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_17126'>was whole, and he had gotten him ten good knights of Arthur’s; and with</a>
<a id='line_17127'>them he rode unto Tintagil. And when he saw the great host of Sessoins</a>
<a id='line_17128'>he marvelled wonder greatly. And then Sir Tristram rode by the woods</a>
<a id='line_17129'>and by the ditches as secretly as he might, till he came nigh the</a>
<a id='line_17130'>gates. And there dressed a knight to him when he saw that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_17131'>would enter; and Sir Tristram smote him down dead, and so he served</a>
<a id='line_17132'>three more. And everych of these ten knights slew a man of arms. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_17133'>Tristram entered into the Castle of Tintagil. And when King Mark wist</a>
<a id='line_17134'>that Sir Tristram was come he was glad of his coming, and so was all</a>
<a id='line_17135'>the fellowship, and of him they made great joy.</a>
<a id='line_17136'></a>
<a id='line_17137'></a>
<a id='line_17138'></a>
<a id='line_17139'></a>
<a id='line_17140'>CHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Tristram overcame the battle, and how Elias</a>
<a id='line_17141'>desired a man to fight body for body.</a>
<a id='line_17142'></a>
<a id='line_17143'></a>
<a id='line_17144'>So on the morn Elias the captain came, and bade King Mark: Come out and</a>
<a id='line_17145'>do battle; for now the good knight Sir Tristram is entered it will be</a>
<a id='line_17146'>shame to thee, said Elias, for to keep thy walls. When King Mark</a>
<a id='line_17147'>understood this he was wroth and said no word, but went unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_17148'>Tristram and asked him his counsel. Sir, said Sir Tristram, will ye</a>
<a id='line_17149'>that I give him his answer? I will well, said King Mark. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_17150'>Tristram said thus to the messenger: Bear thy lord word from the king</a>
<a id='line_17151'>and me, that we will do battle with him to-morn in the plain field.</a>
<a id='line_17152'>What is your name? said the messenger. Wit thou well my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_17153'>Tristram de Liones. Therewithal the messenger departed and told his</a>
<a id='line_17154'>lord Elias all that he had heard. Sir, said Sir Tristram unto King</a>
<a id='line_17155'>Mark, I pray you give me leave to have the rule of the battle. I pray</a>
<a id='line_17156'>you take the rule, said King Mark. Then Sir Tristram let devise the</a>
<a id='line_17157'>battle in what manner that it should be. He let depart his host in six</a>
<a id='line_17158'>parties, and ordained Sir Dinas the Seneschal to have the foreward, and</a>
<a id='line_17159'>other knights to rule the remnant. And the same night Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_17160'>burnt all the Sessoins’ ships unto the cold water. Anon, as Elias wist</a>
<a id='line_17161'>that, he said it was of Sir Tristram’s doing: For he casteth that we</a>
<a id='line_17162'>shall never escape, mother son of us. Therefore, fair fellows, fight</a>
<a id='line_17163'>freely to-morrow, and miscomfort you nought; for any knight, though he</a>
<a id='line_17164'>be the best knight in the world, he may not have ado with us all.</a>
<a id='line_17165'></a>
<a id='line_17166'>Then they ordained their battle in four parties, wonderly well</a>
<a id='line_17167'>apparelled and garnished with men of arms. Thus they within issued, and</a>
<a id='line_17168'>they without set freely upon them; and there Sir Dinas did great deeds</a>
<a id='line_17169'>of arms. Not for then Sir Dinas and his fellowship were put to the</a>
<a id='line_17170'>worse. With that came Sir Tristram and slew two knights with one spear;</a>
<a id='line_17171'>then he slew on the right hand and on the left hand, that men marvelled</a>
<a id='line_17172'>that ever he might do such deeds of arms. And then he might see</a>
<a id='line_17173'>sometime the battle was driven a bow-draught from the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_17174'>sometime it was at the gates of the castle. Then came Elias the captain</a>
<a id='line_17175'>rushing here and there, and hit King Mark so sore upon the helm that he</a>
<a id='line_17176'>made him to avoid the saddle. And then Sir Dinas gat King Mark again to</a>
<a id='line_17177'>horseback. Therewithal came in Sir Tristram like a lion, and there he</a>
<a id='line_17178'>met with Elias, and he smote him so sore upon the helm that he avoided</a>
<a id='line_17179'>his saddle. And thus they fought till it was night, and for great</a>
<a id='line_17180'>slaughter and for wounded people everych party drew to their rest.</a>
<a id='line_17181'></a>
<a id='line_17182'>And when King Mark was come within the Castle of Tintagil he lacked of</a>
<a id='line_17183'>his knights an hundred, and they without lacked two hundred; and they</a>
<a id='line_17184'>searched the wounded men on both parties. And then they went to</a>
<a id='line_17185'>council; and wit you well either party were loath to fight more, so</a>
<a id='line_17186'>that either might escape with their worship. When Elias the captain</a>
<a id='line_17187'>understood the death of his men he made great dole; and when he wist</a>
<a id='line_17188'>that they were loath to go to battle again he was wroth out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_17189'>Then Elias sent word unto King Mark, in great despite, whether he would</a>
<a id='line_17190'>find a knight that would fight for him body for body. And if that he</a>
<a id='line_17191'>might slay King Mark’s knight, he to have the truage of Cornwall</a>
<a id='line_17192'>yearly. And if that his knight slay mine, I fully release my claim</a>
<a id='line_17193'>forever. Then the messenger departed unto King Mark, and told him how</a>
<a id='line_17194'>that his lord Elias had sent him word to find a knight to do battle</a>
<a id='line_17195'>with him body for body. When King Mark understood the messenger, he</a>
<a id='line_17196'>bade him abide and he should have his answer. Then called he all the</a>
<a id='line_17197'>baronage together to wit what was the best counsel. They said all at</a>
<a id='line_17198'>once: To fight in a field we have no lust, for had not been Sir</a>
<a id='line_17199'>Tristram’s prowess it had been likely that we never should have</a>
<a id='line_17200'>escaped; and therefore, sir, as we deem, it were well done to find a</a>
<a id='line_17201'>knight that would do battle with him, for he knightly proffereth.</a>
<a id='line_17202'></a>

<a id='line_17206'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Elias and Sir Tristram fought together for the</a>
<a id='line_17207'>truage, and how Sir Tristram slew Elias in the field.</a>
<a id='line_17208'></a>
<a id='line_17209'></a>
<a id='line_17210'>Not for then when all this was said, they could find no knight that</a>
<a id='line_17211'>would do battle with him. Sir king, said they all, here is no knight</a>
<a id='line_17212'>that dare fight with Elias. Alas, said King Mark, then am I utterly</a>
<a id='line_17213'>ashamed and utterly destroyed, unless that my nephew Sir Tristram will</a>
<a id='line_17214'>take the battle upon him. Wit you well, they said all, he had yesterday</a>
<a id='line_17215'>overmuch on hand, and he is weary for travail, and sore wounded. Where</a>
<a id='line_17216'>is he? said King Mark. Sir, said they, he is in his bed to repose him.</a>
<a id='line_17217'>Alas, said King Mark, but I have the succour of my nephew Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_17218'>I am utterly destroyed for ever.</a>
<a id='line_17219'></a>
<a id='line_17220'>Therewith one went to Sir Tristram where he lay, and told him what King</a>
<a id='line_17221'>Mark had said. And therewith Sir Tristram arose lightly, and put on him</a>
<a id='line_17222'>a long gown, and came afore the king and all the lords. And when he saw</a>
<a id='line_17223'>them all so dismayed he asked the king and the lords what tidings were</a>
<a id='line_17224'>with them. Never worse, said the king. And therewith he told him all,</a>
<a id='line_17225'>how he had word of Elias to find a knight to fight for the truage of</a>
<a id='line_17226'>Cornwall, and none can I find. And as for you, said the king and all</a>
<a id='line_17227'>the lords, we may ask no more of you for shame; for through your</a>
<a id='line_17228'>hardiness yesterday ye saved all our lives. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now</a>
<a id='line_17229'>I understand ye would have my succour, reason would that I should do</a>
<a id='line_17230'>all that lieth in my power to do, saving my worship and my life,</a>
<a id='line_17231'>howbeit I am sore bruised and hurt. And sithen Sir Elias proffereth so</a>
<a id='line_17232'>largely, I shall fight with him, or else I will be slain in the field,</a>
<a id='line_17233'>or else I will deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And therefore</a>
<a id='line_17234'>lightly call his messenger and he shall be answered, for as yet my</a>
<a id='line_17235'>wounds be green, and they will be sorer a seven night after than they</a>
<a id='line_17236'>be now; and therefore he shall have his answer that I will do battle</a>
<a id='line_17237'>to-morn with him.</a>
<a id='line_17238'></a>
<a id='line_17239'>Then was the messenger departed brought before King Mark. Hark, my</a>
<a id='line_17240'>fellow, said Sir Tristram, go fast unto thy lord, and bid him make true</a>
<a id='line_17241'>assurance on his part for the truage, as the king here shall make on</a>
<a id='line_17242'>his part; and then tell thy lord, Sir Elias, that I, Sir Tristram, King</a>
<a id='line_17243'>Arthur’s knight, and knight of the Table Round, will as to-morn meet</a>
<a id='line_17244'>with thy lord on horseback, to do battle as long as my horse may</a>
<a id='line_17245'>endure, and after that to do battle with him on foot to the utterance.</a>
<a id='line_17246'>The messenger beheld Sir Tristram from the top to the toe; and</a>
<a id='line_17247'>therewithal he departed and came to his lord, and told him how he was</a>
<a id='line_17248'>answered of Sir Tristram. And therewithal was made hostage on both</a>
<a id='line_17249'>parties, and made it as sure as it might be, that whether party had the</a>
<a id='line_17250'>victory, so to end. And then were both hosts assembled on both parts of</a>
<a id='line_17251'>the field, without the Castle of Tintagil, and there was none but Sir</a>
<a id='line_17252'>Tristram and Sir Elias armed.</a>
<a id='line_17253'></a>
<a id='line_17254'>So when the appointment was made, they departed in-sunder, and they</a>
<a id='line_17255'>came together with all the might that their horses might run. And</a>
<a id='line_17256'>either knight smote other so hard that both horses and knights went to</a>
<a id='line_17257'>the earth. Not for then they both lightly arose and dressed their</a>
<a id='line_17258'>shields on their shoulders, with naked swords in their hands, and they</a>
<a id='line_17259'>dashed together that it seemed a flaming fire about them. Thus they</a>
<a id='line_17260'>traced, and traversed, and hewed on helms and hauberks, and cut away</a>
<a id='line_17261'>many cantels of their shields, and either wounded other passing sore,</a>
<a id='line_17262'>so that the hot blood fell freshly upon the earth. And by then they had</a>
<a id='line_17263'>foughten the mountenance of an hour Sir Tristram waxed faint and</a>
<a id='line_17264'>for-bled, and gave sore aback. That saw Sir Elias, and followed</a>
<a id='line_17265'>fiercely upon him, and wounded him in many places. And ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_17266'>Tristram traced and traversed, and went froward him here and there, and</a>
<a id='line_17267'>covered him with his shield as he might all weakly, that all men said</a>
<a id='line_17268'>he was overcome; for Sir Elias had given him twenty strokes against</a>
<a id='line_17269'>one.</a>
<a id='line_17270'></a>
<a id='line_17271'>Then was there laughing of the Sessoins’ party, and great dole on King</a>
<a id='line_17272'>Mark’s party. Alas, said the king, we are ashamed and destroyed all for</a>
<a id='line_17273'>ever: for as the book saith, Sir Tristram was never so matched, but if</a>
<a id='line_17274'>it were Sir Launcelot. Thus as they stood and beheld both parties, that</a>
<a id='line_17275'>one party laughing and the other party weeping, Sir Tristram remembered</a>
<a id='line_17276'>him of his lady, La Beale Isoud, that looked upon him, and how he was</a>
<a id='line_17277'>likely never to come in her presence. Then he pulled up his shield that</a>
<a id='line_17278'>erst hung full low. And then he dressed up his shield unto Elias, and</a>
<a id='line_17279'>gave him many sad strokes, twenty against one, and all to-brake his</a>
<a id='line_17280'>shield and his hauberk, that the hot blood ran down to the earth. Then</a>
<a id='line_17281'>began King Mark to laugh, and all Cornish men, and that other party to</a>
<a id='line_17282'>weep. And ever Sir Tristram said to Sir Elias: Yield thee.</a>
<a id='line_17283'></a>
<a id='line_17284'>Then when Sir Tristram saw him so staggering on the ground, he said:</a>
<a id='line_17285'>Sir Elias, I am right sorry for thee, for thou art a passing good</a>
<a id='line_17286'>knight as ever I met withal, except Sir Launcelot. Therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_17287'>Elias fell to the earth, and there died. What shall I do, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_17288'>Tristram unto King Mark, for this battle is at an end? Then they of</a>
<a id='line_17289'>Elias’ party departed, and King Mark took of them many prisoners, to</a>
<a id='line_17290'>redress the harms and the scathes that he had of them; and the remnant</a>
<a id='line_17291'>he sent into their country to borrow out their fellows. Then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_17292'>Tristram searched and well healed. Yet for all this King Mark would</a>
<a id='line_17293'>fain have slain Sir Tristram. But for all that ever Sir Tristram saw or</a>
<a id='line_17294'>heard by King Mark, yet would he never beware of his treason, but ever</a>
<a id='line_17295'>he would be thereas La Beale Isoud was.</a>

<a id='line_17300'>CHAPTER XXXI. How at a great feast that King Mark made an harper came</a>
<a id='line_17301'>and sang the lay that Dinadan had made.</a>
<a id='line_17302'></a>
<a id='line_17303'></a>
<a id='line_17304'>Now will we pass of this matter, and speak we of the harpers that Sir</a>
<a id='line_17305'>Launcelot and Sir Dinadan had sent into Cornwall. And at the great</a>
<a id='line_17306'>feast that King Mark made for joy that the Sessoins were put out of his</a>
<a id='line_17307'>country, then came Eliot the harper with the lay that Dinadan had made</a>
<a id='line_17308'>and secretly brought it unto Sir Tristram, and told him the lay that</a>
<a id='line_17309'>Dinadan had made by King Mark. And when Sir Tristram heard it, he said:</a>
<a id='line_17310'>O Lord Jesu, that Dinadan can make wonderly well and ill, thereas it</a>
<a id='line_17311'>shall be. Sir, said Eliot, dare I sing this song afore King Mark? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_17312'>on my peril, said Sir Tristram, for I shall be thy warrant. Then at the</a>
<a id='line_17313'>meat came in Eliot the harper, and because he was a curious harper men</a>
<a id='line_17314'>heard him sing the same lay that Dinadan had made, the which spake the</a>
<a id='line_17315'>most villainy by King Mark of his treason that ever man heard.</a>
<a id='line_17316'></a>
<a id='line_17317'>When the harper had sung his song to the end King Mark was wonderly</a>
<a id='line_17318'>wroth, and said: Thou harper, how durst thou be so bold on thy head to</a>
<a id='line_17319'>sing this song afore me. Sir, said Eliot, wit you well I am a minstrel,</a>
<a id='line_17320'>and I must do as I am commanded of these lords that I bear the arms of.</a>
<a id='line_17321'>And sir, wit ye well that Sir Dinadan, a knight of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_17322'>made this song, and made me to sing it afore you. Thou sayest well,</a>
<a id='line_17323'>said King Mark, and because thou art a minstrel thou shalt go quit, but</a>
<a id='line_17324'>I charge thee hie thee fast out of my sight. So the harper departed and</a>
<a id='line_17325'>went to Sir Tristram, and told him how he had sped. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_17326'>let make letters as goodly as he could to Launcelot and to Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_17327'>And so he let conduct the harper out of the country. But to say that</a>
<a id='line_17328'>King Mark was wonderly wroth, he was, for he deemed that the lay that</a>
<a id='line_17329'>was sung afore him was made by Sir Tristram’s counsel, wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_17330'>thought to slay him and all his well-willers in that country.</a>

<a id='line_17335'>CHAPTER XXXII. How King Mark slew by treason his brother Boudwin, for</a>
<a id='line_17336'>good service that he had done to him.</a>
<a id='line_17337'></a>
<a id='line_17338'></a>
<a id='line_17339'>Now turn we to another matter that fell between King Mark and his</a>
<a id='line_17340'>brother, that was called the good Prince Boudwin, that all the people</a>
<a id='line_17341'>of the country loved passing well. So it befell on a time that the</a>
<a id='line_17342'>miscreant Saracens landed in the country of Cornwall soon after these</a>
<a id='line_17343'>Sessoins were gone. And then the good Prince Boudwin, at the landing,</a>
<a id='line_17344'>he raised the country privily and hastily. And or it were day he let</a>
<a id='line_17345'>put wildfire in three of his own ships, and suddenly he pulled up the</a>
<a id='line_17346'>sail, and with the wind he made those ships to be driven among the navy</a>
<a id='line_17347'>of the Saracens. And to make short tale, those three ships set on fire</a>
<a id='line_17348'>all the ships, that none were saved. And at point of the day the good</a>
<a id='line_17349'>Prince Boudwin with all his fellowship set on the miscreants with</a>
<a id='line_17350'>shouts and cries, and slew to the number of forty thousand, and left</a>
<a id='line_17351'>none alive.</a>
<a id='line_17352'></a>
<a id='line_17353'>When King Mark wist this he was wonderly wroth that his brother should</a>
<a id='line_17354'>win such worship. And because this prince was better beloved than he in</a>
<a id='line_17355'>all that country, and that also Boudwin loved well Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_17356'>therefore he thought to slay him. And thus, hastily, as a man out of</a>
<a id='line_17357'>his wit, he sent for Prince Boudwin and Anglides his wife, and bade</a>
<a id='line_17358'>them bring their young son with them, that he might see him. All this</a>
<a id='line_17359'>he did to the intent to slay the child as well as his father, for he</a>
<a id='line_17360'>was the falsest traitor that ever was born. Alas, for his goodness and</a>
<a id='line_17361'>for his good deeds this gentle Prince Boudwin was slain. So when he</a>
<a id='line_17362'>came with his wife Anglides, the king made them fair semblant till they</a>
<a id='line_17363'>had dined. And when they had dined King Mark sent for his brother and</a>
<a id='line_17364'>said thus: Brother, how sped you when the miscreants arrived by you?</a>
<a id='line_17365'>meseemeth it had been your part to have sent me word, that I might have</a>
<a id='line_17366'>been at that journey, for it had been reason that I had had the honour</a>
<a id='line_17367'>and not you. Sir, said the Prince Boudwin, it was so that an I had</a>
<a id='line_17368'>tarried till that I had sent for you those miscreants had destroyed my</a>
<a id='line_17369'>country. Thou liest, false traitor, said King Mark, for thou art ever</a>
<a id='line_17370'>about for to win worship from me, and put me to dishonour, and thou</a>
<a id='line_17371'>cherishest that I hate. And therewith he struck him to the heart with a</a>
<a id='line_17372'>dagger, that he never after spake word. Then the Lady Anglides made</a>
<a id='line_17373'>great dole, and swooned, for she saw her lord slain afore her face.</a>
<a id='line_17374'>Then was there no more to do but Prince Boudwin was despoiled and</a>
<a id='line_17375'>brought to burial. But Anglides privily gat her husband’s doublet and</a>
<a id='line_17376'>his shirt, and that she kept secretly.</a>
<a id='line_17377'></a>
<a id='line_17378'>Then was there much sorrow and crying, and great dole made Sir</a>
<a id='line_17379'>Tristram, Sir Dinas, Sir Fergus, and so did all knights that were</a>
<a id='line_17380'>there; for that prince was passingly well beloved. So La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_17381'>sent unto Anglides, the Prince Boudwin’s wife, and bade her avoid</a>
<a id='line_17382'>lightly or else her young son, Alisander le Orphelin, should be slain.</a>
<a id='line_17383'>When she heard this, she took her horse and her child; and rode with</a>
<a id='line_17384'>such poor men as durst ride with her.</a>
<a id='line_17385'></a>

<a id='line_17389'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Anglides, Boudwin’s wife, escaped with her young</a>
<a id='line_17390'>son, Alisander le Orphelin, and came to the Castle of Arundel.</a>
<a id='line_17391'></a>
<a id='line_17392'></a>
<a id='line_17393'>Notwithstanding, when King Mark had done this deed, yet he thought to</a>
<a id='line_17394'>do more vengeance; and with his sword in his hand, he sought from</a>
<a id='line_17395'>chamber to chamber, to seek Anglides and her young son. And when she</a>
<a id='line_17396'>was missed he called a good knight that hight Sadok, and charged him by</a>
<a id='line_17397'>pain of death to fetch Anglides again and her young son. So Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_17398'>departed and rode after Anglides. And within ten mile he overtook her,</a>
<a id='line_17399'>and bade her turn again and ride with him to King Mark. Alas, fair</a>
<a id='line_17400'>knight, she said, what shall ye win by my son’s death or by mine? I</a>
<a id='line_17401'>have had overmuch harm and too great a loss. Madam, said Sadok, of your</a>
<a id='line_17402'>loss is dole and pity; but madam, said Sadok, would ye depart out of</a>
<a id='line_17403'>this country with your son, and keep him till he be of age, that he may</a>
<a id='line_17404'>revenge his father’s death, then would I suffer you to depart from me,</a>
<a id='line_17405'>so you promise me to revenge the death of Prince Boudwin. Ah, gentle</a>
<a id='line_17406'>knight, Jesu thank thee, and if ever my son, Alisander le Orphelin,</a>
<a id='line_17407'>live to be a knight, he shall have his father’s doublet and his shirt</a>
<a id='line_17408'>with the bloody marks, and I shall give him such a charge that he shall</a>
<a id='line_17409'>remember it while he liveth. And therewithal Sadok departed from her,</a>
<a id='line_17410'>and either betook other to God. And when Sadok came to King Mark he</a>
<a id='line_17411'>told him faithfully that he had drowned young Alisander her son; and</a>
<a id='line_17412'>thereof King Mark was full glad.</a>
<a id='line_17413'></a>
<a id='line_17414'>Now turn we unto Anglides, that rode both night and day by adventure</a>
<a id='line_17415'>out of Cornwall, and little and in few places she rested; but ever she</a>
<a id='line_17416'>drew southward to the seaside, till by fortune she came to a castle</a>
<a id='line_17417'>that is called Magouns, and now it is called Arundel, in Sussex. And</a>
<a id='line_17418'>the Constable of the castle welcomed her, and said she was welcome to</a>
<a id='line_17419'>her own castle; and there was Anglides worshipfully received, for the</a>
<a id='line_17420'>Constable’s wife was nigh her cousin, and the Constable’s name was</a>
<a id='line_17421'>Bellangere; and that same Constable told Anglides that the same castle</a>
<a id='line_17422'>was hers by right inheritance. Thus Anglides endured years and winters,</a>
<a id='line_17423'>till Alisander was big and strong; there was none so wight in all that</a>
<a id='line_17424'>country, neither there was none that might do no manner of mastery</a>
<a id='line_17425'>afore him.</a>
<a id='line_17426'></a>

<a id='line_17430'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Anglides gave the bloody doublet to Alisander, her</a>
<a id='line_17431'>son, the same day that he was made knight, and the charge withal.</a>
<a id='line_17432'></a>
<a id='line_17433'></a>
<a id='line_17434'>Then upon a day Bellangere the Constable came to Anglides and said:</a>
<a id='line_17435'>Madam, it were time my lord Alisander were made knight, for he is a</a>
<a id='line_17436'>passing strong young man. Sir, said she, I would he were made knight;</a>
<a id='line_17437'>but then must I give him the most charge that ever sinful mother gave</a>
<a id='line_17438'>to her child. Do as ye list, said Bellangere, and I shall give him</a>
<a id='line_17439'>warning that he shall be made knight. Now it will be well done that he</a>
<a id='line_17440'>may be made knight at our Lady Day in Lent. Be it so, said Anglides,</a>
<a id='line_17441'>and I pray you make ready therefore. So came the Constable to</a>
<a id='line_17442'>Alisander, and told him that he should at our Lady Day in Lent be made</a>
<a id='line_17443'>knight. I thank God, said Alisander; these are the best tidings that</a>
<a id='line_17444'>ever came to me. Then the Constable ordained twenty of the greatest</a>
<a id='line_17445'>gentlemen’s sons, and the best born men of the country, that should be</a>
<a id='line_17446'>made knights that same day that Alisander was made knight. So on the</a>
<a id='line_17447'>same day that Alisander and his twenty fellows were made knights, at</a>
<a id='line_17448'>the offering of the mass there came Anglides unto her son and said</a>
<a id='line_17449'>thus: O fair sweet son, I charge thee upon my blessing, and of the high</a>
<a id='line_17450'>order of chivalry that thou takest here this day, that thou understand</a>
<a id='line_17451'>what I shall say and charge thee withal. Therewithal she pulled out a</a>
<a id='line_17452'>bloody doublet and a bloody shirt, that were be-bled with old blood.</a>
<a id='line_17453'>When Alisander saw this he stert aback and waxed pale, and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_17454'>mother, what may this mean? I shall tell thee, fair son: this was thine</a>
<a id='line_17455'>own father’s doublet and shirt, that he wore upon him that same day</a>
<a id='line_17456'>that he was slain. And there she told him why and wherefore, and how</a>
<a id='line_17457'>for his goodness King Mark slew him with his dagger afore mine own</a>
<a id='line_17458'>eyen. And therefore this shall be your charge that I shall give thee.</a>
<a id='line_17459'></a>

<a id='line_17463'>CHAPTER XXXV. How it was told to King Mark of Sir Alisander, and how he</a>
<a id='line_17464'>would have slain Sir Sadok for saving his life.</a>
<a id='line_17465'></a>
<a id='line_17466'></a>
<a id='line_17467'>Now I require thee, and charge thee upon my blessing, and upon the high</a>
<a id='line_17468'>order of knighthood, that thou be revenged upon King Mark for the death</a>
<a id='line_17469'>of thy father. And therewithal she swooned. Then Alisander leapt to his</a>
<a id='line_17470'>mother, and took her up in his arms, and said: Fair mother, ye have</a>
<a id='line_17471'>given me a great charge, and here I promise you I shall be avenged upon</a>
<a id='line_17472'>King Mark when that I may; and that I promise to God and to you. So</a>
<a id='line_17473'>this feast was ended, and the Constable, by the advice of Anglides, let</a>
<a id='line_17474'>purvey that Alisander was well horsed and harnessed. Then he jousted</a>
<a id='line_17475'>with his twenty fellows that were made knights with him, but for to</a>
<a id='line_17476'>make a short tale, he overthrew all those twenty, that none might</a>
<a id='line_17477'>withstand him a buffet.</a>
<a id='line_17478'></a>
<a id='line_17479'>Then one of those knights departed unto King Mark, and told him all,</a>
<a id='line_17480'>how Alisander was made knight, and all the charge that his mother gave</a>
<a id='line_17481'>him, as ye have heard afore time. Alas, false treason, said King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_17482'>I weened that young traitor had been dead. Alas, whom may I trust? And</a>
<a id='line_17483'>therewithal King Mark took a sword in his hand; and sought Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_17484'>from chamber to chamber to slay him. When Sir Sadok saw King Mark come</a>
<a id='line_17485'>with his sword in his hand he said thus: Beware, King Mark, and come</a>
<a id='line_17486'>not nigh me; for wit thou well that I saved Alisander his life, of</a>
<a id='line_17487'>which I never repent me, for thou falsely and cowardly slew his father</a>
<a id='line_17488'>Boudwin, traitorly for his good deeds; wherefore I pray Almighty Jesu</a>
<a id='line_17489'>send Alisander might and strength to be revenged upon thee. And now</a>
<a id='line_17490'>beware King Mark of young Alisander, for he is made a knight. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_17491'>said King Mark, that ever I should hear a traitor say so afore me. And</a>
<a id='line_17492'>therewith four knights of King Mark’s drew their swords to slay Sir</a>
<a id='line_17493'>Sadok, but anon Sir Sadok slew them all in King Mark’s presence. And</a>
<a id='line_17494'>then Sir Sadok passed forth into his chamber, and took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_17495'>his harness, and rode on his way a good pace. For there was neither Sir</a>
<a id='line_17496'>Tristram, neither Sir Dinas, nor Sir Fergus, that would Sir Sadok any</a>
<a id='line_17497'>evil will. Then was King Mark wroth, and thought to destroy Sir</a>
<a id='line_17498'>Alisander and Sir Sadok that had saved him; for King Mark dreaded and</a>
<a id='line_17499'>hated Alisander most of any man living.</a>
<a id='line_17500'></a>
<a id='line_17501'>When Sir Tristram understood that Alisander was made knight, anon</a>
<a id='line_17502'>forthwithal he sent him a letter, praying him and charging him that he</a>
<a id='line_17503'>would draw him to the court of King Arthur, and that he put him in the</a>
<a id='line_17504'>rule and in the hands of Sir Launcelot. So this letter was sent to</a>
<a id='line_17505'>Alisander from his cousin, Sir Tristram. And at that time he thought to</a>
<a id='line_17506'>do after his commandment. Then King Mark called a knight that brought</a>
<a id='line_17507'>him the tidings from Alisander, and bade him abide still in that</a>
<a id='line_17508'>country. Sir, said that knight, so must I do, for in my own country I</a>
<a id='line_17509'>dare not come. No force, said King Mark, I shall give thee here double</a>
<a id='line_17510'>as much lands as ever thou hadst of thine own. But within short space</a>
<a id='line_17511'>Sir Sadok met with that false knight, and slew him. Then was King Mark</a>
<a id='line_17512'>wood wroth out of measure. Then he sent unto Queen Morgan le Fay, and</a>
<a id='line_17513'>to the Queen of Northgalis, praying them in his letters that they two</a>
<a id='line_17514'>sorceresses would set all the country in fire with ladies that were</a>
<a id='line_17515'>enchantresses, and by such that were dangerous knights, as Malgrin,</a>
<a id='line_17516'>Breuse Saunce Pité, that by no mean Alisander le Orphelin should</a>
<a id='line_17517'>escape, but either he should be taken or slain. This ordinance made</a>
<a id='line_17518'>King Mark for to destroy Alisander.</a>

<a id='line_17523'>CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Alisander won the prize at a tournament, and of</a>
<a id='line_17524'>Morgan le Fay: and how he fought with Sir Malgrin, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_17525'></a>
<a id='line_17526'></a>
<a id='line_17527'>Now turn we again unto Sir Alisander, that at his departing his mother</a>
<a id='line_17528'>took with him his father’s bloody shirt. So that he bare with him</a>
<a id='line_17529'>always till his death day, in tokening to think of his father’s death.</a>
<a id='line_17530'>So was Alisander purposed to ride to London, by the counsel of Sir</a>
<a id='line_17531'>Tristram, to Sir Launcelot. And by fortune he went by the seaside, and</a>
<a id='line_17532'>rode wrong. And there he won at a tournament the gree that King Carados</a>
<a id='line_17533'>made. And there he smote down King Carados and twenty of his knights,</a>
<a id='line_17534'>and also Sir Safere, a good knight that was Sir Palomides’ brother, the</a>
<a id='line_17535'>good knight. All this saw a damosel, and saw the best knight joust that</a>
<a id='line_17536'>ever she saw. And ever as he smote down knights he made them to swear</a>
<a id='line_17537'>to wear none harness in a twelvemonth and a day. This is well said,</a>
<a id='line_17538'>said Morgan le Fay, this is the knight that I would fain see. And so</a>
<a id='line_17539'>she took her palfrey, and rode a great while, and then she rested her</a>
<a id='line_17540'>in her pavilion. So there came four knights, two were armed, and two</a>
<a id='line_17541'>were unarmed, and they told Morgan le Fay their names: the first was</a>
<a id='line_17542'>Elias de Gomeret, the second was Cari de Gomeret, those were armed;</a>
<a id='line_17543'>that other twain were of Camiliard, cousins unto Queen Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_17544'>that one hight Guy, and that other hight Garaunt, those were unarmed.</a>
<a id='line_17545'>There these four knights told Morgan le Fay how a young knight had</a>
<a id='line_17546'>smitten them down before a castle. For the maiden of that castle said</a>
<a id='line_17547'>that he was but late made knight, and young. But as we suppose, but if</a>
<a id='line_17548'>it were Sir Tristram, or Sir Launcelot, or Sir Lamorak, the good</a>
<a id='line_17549'>knight, there is none that might sit him a buffet with a spear. Well,</a>
<a id='line_17550'>said Morgan le Fay, I shall meet that knight or it be long time, an he</a>
<a id='line_17551'>dwell in that country.</a>
<a id='line_17552'></a>
<a id='line_17553'>So turn we to the damosel of the castle, that when Alisander le</a>
<a id='line_17554'>Orphelin had forjousted the four knights, she called him to her, and</a>
<a id='line_17555'>said thus: Sir knight, wilt thou for my sake joust and fight with a</a>
<a id='line_17556'>knight, for my sake, of this country, that is and hath been long time</a>
<a id='line_17557'>an evil neighbour to me? His name is Malgrin, and he will not suffer me</a>
<a id='line_17558'>to be married in no manner wise for all that I can do, or any knight</a>
<a id='line_17559'>for my sake. Damosel, said Alisander, an he come whiles I am here I</a>
<a id='line_17560'>will fight with him, and my poor body for your sake I will jeopard. And</a>
<a id='line_17561'>therewithal she sent for him, for he was at her commandment. And when</a>
<a id='line_17562'>either had a sight of other, they made them ready for to joust, and</a>
<a id='line_17563'>they came together eagerly, and Malgrin brised his spear upon</a>
<a id='line_17564'>Alisander, and Alisander smote him again so hard that he bare him quite</a>
<a id='line_17565'>from his saddle to the earth. But this Malgrin arose lightly, and</a>
<a id='line_17566'>dressed his shield and drew his sword, and bade him alight, saying:</a>
<a id='line_17567'>Though thou have the better of me on horseback, thou shalt find that I</a>
<a id='line_17568'>shall endure like a knight on foot. It is well said, said Alisander;</a>
<a id='line_17569'>and so lightly he avoided his horse and betook him to his varlet. And</a>
<a id='line_17570'>then they rushed together like two boars, and laid on their helms and</a>
<a id='line_17571'>shields long time, by the space of three hours, that never man could</a>
<a id='line_17572'>say which was the better knight.</a>
<a id='line_17573'></a>
<a id='line_17574'>And in the meanwhile came Morgan le Fay to the damosel of the castle,</a>
<a id='line_17575'>and they beheld the battle. But this Malgrin was an old roted knight,</a>
<a id='line_17576'>and he was called one of the dangerous knights of the world to do</a>
<a id='line_17577'>battle on foot, but on horseback there were many better. And ever this</a>
<a id='line_17578'>Malgrin awaited to slay Alisander, and so wounded him wonderly sore,</a>
<a id='line_17579'>that it was marvel that ever he might stand, for he had bled so much</a>
<a id='line_17580'>blood; for Alisander fought wildly, and not wittily. And that other was</a>
<a id='line_17581'>a felonious knight, and awaited him, and smote him sore. And sometime</a>
<a id='line_17582'>they rushed together with their shields, like two boars or rams, and</a>
<a id='line_17583'>fell grovelling both to the earth. Now knight, said Malgrin, hold thy</a>
<a id='line_17584'>hand a while, and tell me what thou art. I will not, said Alisander,</a>
<a id='line_17585'>but if me list: but tell me thy name, and why thou keepest this</a>
<a id='line_17586'>country, or else thou shalt die of my hands. Wit thou well, said</a>
<a id='line_17587'>Malgrin, that for this maiden’s love, of this castle, I have slain ten</a>
<a id='line_17588'>good knights by mishap; and by outrage and orgulité of myself I have</a>
<a id='line_17589'>slain ten other knights. So God me help, said Alisander, this is the</a>
<a id='line_17590'>foulest confession that ever I heard knight make, nor never heard I</a>
<a id='line_17591'>speak of other men of such a shameful confession; wherefore it were</a>
<a id='line_17592'>great pity and great shame unto me that I should let thee live any</a>
<a id='line_17593'>longer; therefore keep thee as well as ever thou mayest, for as I am</a>
<a id='line_17594'>true knight, either thou shalt slay me or else I shall slay thee, I</a>
<a id='line_17595'>promise thee faithfully.</a>
<a id='line_17596'></a>
<a id='line_17597'>Then they lashed together fiercely, and at the last Alisander smote</a>
<a id='line_17598'>Malgrin to the earth. And then he raced off his helm, and smote off his</a>
<a id='line_17599'>head lightly. And when he had done and ended this battle, anon he</a>
<a id='line_17600'>called to him his varlet, the which brought him his horse. And then he,</a>
<a id='line_17601'>weening to be strong enough, would have mounted. And so she laid Sir</a>
<a id='line_17602'>Alisander in an horse litter, and led him into the castle, for he had</a>
<a id='line_17603'>no foot nor might to stand upon the earth; for he had sixteen great</a>
<a id='line_17604'>wounds, and in especial one of them was like to be his death.</a>
<a id='line_17605'></a>

<a id='line_17608'></a>
<a id='line_17609'>CHAPTER XXXVII. How Queen Morgan le Fay had Alisander in her castle,</a>
<a id='line_17610'>and how she healed his wounds.</a>
<a id='line_17611'></a>
<a id='line_17612'></a>
<a id='line_17613'>Then Queen Morgan le Fay searched his wounds, and gave such an ointment</a>
<a id='line_17614'>unto him that he should have died. And on the morn when she came to him</a>
<a id='line_17615'>he complained him sore; and then she put other ointments upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_17616'>then he was out of his pain. Then came the damosel of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_17617'>said unto Morgan le Fay: I pray you help me that this knight might wed</a>
<a id='line_17618'>me, for he hath won me with his hands. Ye shall see, said Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_17619'>Fay, what I shall say. Then Morgan le Fay went unto Alisander, and bade</a>
<a id='line_17620'>in anywise that he should refuse this lady, an she desire to wed you,</a>
<a id='line_17621'>for she is not for you. So the damosel came and desired of him</a>
<a id='line_17622'>marriage. Damosel, said Orphelin, I thank you, but as yet I cast me not</a>
<a id='line_17623'>to marry in this country. Sir, she said, sithen ye will not marry me, I</a>
<a id='line_17624'>pray you insomuch as ye have won me, that ye will give me to a knight</a>
<a id='line_17625'>of this country that hath been my friend, and loved me many years. With</a>
<a id='line_17626'>all my heart, said Alisander, I will assent thereto. Then was the</a>
<a id='line_17627'>knight sent for, his name was Gerine le Grose. And anon he made them</a>
<a id='line_17628'>handfast, and wedded them.</a>
<a id='line_17629'></a>
<a id='line_17630'>Then came Queen Morgan le Fay to Alisander, and bade him arise, and put</a>
<a id='line_17631'>him in an horse litter, and gave him such a drink that in three days</a>
<a id='line_17632'>and three nights he waked never, but slept; and so she brought him to</a>
<a id='line_17633'>her own castle that at that time was called La Beale Regard. Then</a>
<a id='line_17634'>Morgan le Fay came to Alisander, and asked him if he would fain be</a>
<a id='line_17635'>whole. Who would be sick, said Alisander, an he might be whole? Well,</a>
<a id='line_17636'>said Morgan le Fay, then shall ye promise me by your knighthood that</a>
<a id='line_17637'>this day twelvemonth and a day ye shall not pass the compass of this</a>
<a id='line_17638'>castle, and without doubt ye shall lightly be whole. I assent, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_17639'>Alisander. And there he made her a promise: then was he soon whole. And</a>
<a id='line_17640'>when Alisander was whole, then he repented him of his oath, for he</a>
<a id='line_17641'>might not be revenged upon King Mark. Right so there came a damosel</a>
<a id='line_17642'>that was cousin to the Earl of Pase, and she was cousin to Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_17643'>Fay. And by right that castle of La Beale Regard should have been hers</a>
<a id='line_17644'>by true inheritance. So this damosel entered into this castle where lay</a>
<a id='line_17645'>Alisander, and there she found him upon his bed, passing heavy and all</a>
<a id='line_17646'>sad.</a>

<a id='line_17651'>CHAPTER XXXVIII. How Alisander was delivered from Queen Morgan le Fay</a>
<a id='line_17652'>by the means of a damosel.</a>
<a id='line_17653'></a>
<a id='line_17654'></a>
<a id='line_17655'>Sir knight, said the damosel, an ye would be merry I could tell you</a>
<a id='line_17656'>good tidings. Well were me, said Alisander, an I might hear of good</a>
<a id='line_17657'>tidings, for now I stand as a prisoner by my promise. Sir, she said,</a>
<a id='line_17658'>wit you well that ye be a prisoner, and worse than ye ween; for my</a>
<a id='line_17659'>lady, my cousin Queen Morgan le Fay, keepeth you here for none other</a>
<a id='line_17660'>intent but for to do her pleasure with you when it liketh her. O Jesu</a>
<a id='line_17661'>defend me, said Alisander, from such pleasure; for I had liefer cut</a>
<a id='line_17662'>away my hangers than I would do her such pleasure. As Jesu help me,</a>
<a id='line_17663'>said the damosel, an ye would love me and be ruled by me, I shall make</a>
<a id='line_17664'>your deliverance with your worship. Tell me, said Alisander, by what</a>
<a id='line_17665'>means, and ye shall have my love. Fair knight, said she, this castle of</a>
<a id='line_17666'>right ought to be mine, and I have an uncle the which is a mighty earl,</a>
<a id='line_17667'>he is Earl of Pase, and of all folks he hateth most Morgan le Fay; and</a>
<a id='line_17668'>I shall send unto him and pray him for my sake to destroy this castle</a>
<a id='line_17669'>for the evil customs that be used therein; and then will he come and</a>
<a id='line_17670'>set wild-fire on every part of the castle, and I shall get you out at a</a>
<a id='line_17671'>privy postern, and there shall ye have your horse and your harness. Ye</a>
<a id='line_17672'>say well, damosel, said Alisander. And then she said: Ye may keep the</a>
<a id='line_17673'>room of this castle this twelvemonth and a day, then break ye not your</a>
<a id='line_17674'>oath. Truly, fair damosel, said Alisander, ye say sooth. And then he</a>
<a id='line_17675'>kissed her, and did to her pleasaunce as it pleased them both at times</a>
<a id='line_17676'>and leisures.</a>
<a id='line_17677'></a>
<a id='line_17678'>So anon she sent unto her uncle and bade him come and destroy that</a>
<a id='line_17679'>castle, for as the book saith, he would have destroyed that castle</a>
<a id='line_17680'>afore time had not that damosel been. When the earl understood her</a>
<a id='line_17681'>letters he sent her word again that on such a day he would come and</a>
<a id='line_17682'>destroy that castle. So when that day came she showed Alisander a</a>
<a id='line_17683'>postern wherethrough he should flee into a garden, and there he should</a>
<a id='line_17684'>find his armour and his horse. When the day came that was set, thither</a>
<a id='line_17685'>came the Earl of Pase with four hundred knights, and set on fire all</a>
<a id='line_17686'>the parts of the castle, that or they ceased they left not a stone</a>
<a id='line_17687'>standing. And all this while that the fire was in the castle he abode</a>
<a id='line_17688'>in the garden. And when the fire was done he let make a cry that he</a>
<a id='line_17689'>would keep that piece of earth thereas the castle of La Beale Regard</a>
<a id='line_17690'>was a twelvemonth and a day, from all manner knights that would come.</a>
<a id='line_17691'></a>
<a id='line_17692'>So it happed there was a duke that hight Ansirus, and he was of the kin</a>
<a id='line_17693'>of Sir Launcelot. And this knight was a great pilgrim, for every third</a>
<a id='line_17694'>year he would be at Jerusalem. And because he used all his life to go</a>
<a id='line_17695'>in pilgrimage men called him Duke Ansirus the Pilgrim. And this duke</a>
<a id='line_17696'>had a daughter that hight Alice, that was a passing fair woman, and</a>
<a id='line_17697'>because of her father she was called Alice la Beale Pilgrim. And anon</a>
<a id='line_17698'>as she heard of this cry she went unto Arthur’s court, and said openly</a>
<a id='line_17699'>in hearing of many knights, that what knight may overcome that knight</a>
<a id='line_17700'>that keepeth that piece of earth shall have me and all my lands.</a>
<a id='line_17701'></a>
<a id='line_17702'>When the knights of the Round Table heard her say thus many were glad,</a>
<a id='line_17703'>for she was passing fair and of great rents. Right so she let cry in</a>
<a id='line_17704'>castles and towns as fast on her side as Alisander did on his side.</a>
<a id='line_17705'>Then she dressed her pavilion straight by the piece of the earth that</a>
<a id='line_17706'>Alisander kept. So she was not so soon there but there came a knight of</a>
<a id='line_17707'>Arthur’s court that hight Sagramore le Desirous, and he proffered to</a>
<a id='line_17708'>joust with Alisander; and they encountered, and Sagramore le Desirous</a>
<a id='line_17709'>brised his spear upon Sir Alisander, but Sir Alisander smote him so</a>
<a id='line_17710'>hard that he avoided his saddle. And when La Beale Alice saw him joust</a>
<a id='line_17711'>so well, she thought him a passing goodly knight on horseback. And then</a>
<a id='line_17712'>she leapt out of her pavilion, and took Sir Alisander by the bridle,</a>
<a id='line_17713'>and thus she said: Fair knight, I require thee of thy knighthood show</a>
<a id='line_17714'>me thy visage. I dare well, said Alisander, show my visage. And then he</a>
<a id='line_17715'>put off his helm; and she saw his visage, she said: O sweet Jesu, thee</a>
<a id='line_17716'>I must love, and never other. Then show me your visage, said he.</a>
<a id='line_17717'></a>
<a id='line_17718'></a>
<a id='line_17719'></a>
<a id='line_17720'></a>
<a id='line_17721'>CHAPTER XXXIX. How Alisander met with Alice la Beale Pilgrim, and how</a>
<a id='line_17722'>he jousted with two knights; and after of him and of Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_17723'></a>
<a id='line_17724'></a>
<a id='line_17725'>Then she unwimpled her visage. And when he saw her he said: Here have I</a>
<a id='line_17726'>found my love and my lady. Truly, fair lady, said he, I promise you to</a>
<a id='line_17727'>be your knight, and none other that beareth the life. Now, gentle</a>
<a id='line_17728'>knight, said she, tell me your name. My name is, said he, Alisander le</a>
<a id='line_17729'>Orphelin. Now, damosel, tell me your name, said he. My name is, said</a>
<a id='line_17730'>she, Alice la Beale Pilgrim. And when we be more at our heart’s ease,</a>
<a id='line_17731'>both ye and I shall tell other of what blood we be come. So there was</a>
<a id='line_17732'>great love betwixt them. And as they thus talked there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_17733'>that hight Harsouse le Berbuse, and asked part of Sir Alisander’s</a>
<a id='line_17734'>spears. Then Sir Alisander encountered with him, and at the first Sir</a>
<a id='line_17735'>Alisander smote him over his horse’s croup. And then there came another</a>
<a id='line_17736'>knight that hight Sir Hewgon, and Sir Alisander smote him down as he</a>
<a id='line_17737'>did that other. Then Sir Hewgon proffered to do battle on foot. Sir</a>
<a id='line_17738'>Alisander overcame him with three strokes, and there would have slain</a>
<a id='line_17739'>him had he not yielded him. So then Alisander made both those knights</a>
<a id='line_17740'>to swear to wear none armour in a twelvemonth and a day.</a>
<a id='line_17741'></a>
<a id='line_17742'>Then Sir Alisander alighted down, and went to rest him and repose him.</a>
<a id='line_17743'>Then the damosel that helped Sir Alisander out of the castle, in her</a>
<a id='line_17744'>play told Alice all together how he was prisoner in the castle of La</a>
<a id='line_17745'>Beale Regard, and there she told her how she got him out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_17746'>Sir, said Alice la Beale Pilgrim, meseemeth ye are much beholding to</a>
<a id='line_17747'>this maiden. That is truth, said Sir Alisander. And there Alice told</a>
<a id='line_17748'>him of what blood she was come. Sir, wit ye well, she said, that I am</a>
<a id='line_17749'>of the blood of King Ban, that was father unto Sir Launcelot. Y-wis,</a>
<a id='line_17750'>fair lady, said Alisander, my mother told me that my father was brother</a>
<a id='line_17751'>unto a king, and I nigh cousin unto Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_17752'></a>
<a id='line_17753'>Then this while came there three knights, that one hight Vains, and the</a>
<a id='line_17754'>other hight Harvis de les Marches, and the third hight Perin de la</a>
<a id='line_17755'>Montaine. And with one spear Sir Alisander smote them down all three,</a>
<a id='line_17756'>and gave them such falls that they had no list to fight upon foot. So</a>
<a id='line_17757'>he made them to swear to wear none arms in a twelvemonth. So when they</a>
<a id='line_17758'>were departed Sir Alisander beheld his lady Alice on horseback as he</a>
<a id='line_17759'>stood in her pavilion. And then was he so enamoured upon her that he</a>
<a id='line_17760'>wist not whether he were on horseback or on foot.</a>
<a id='line_17761'></a>
<a id='line_17762'>Right so came the false knight Sir Mordred, and saw Sir Alisander was</a>
<a id='line_17763'>assotted upon his lady; and therewithal he took his horse by the</a>
<a id='line_17764'>bridle, and led him here and there, and had cast to have led him out of</a>
<a id='line_17765'>that place to have shamed him. When the damosel that helped him out of</a>
<a id='line_17766'>that castle saw how shamefully he was led, anon she let arm her, and</a>
<a id='line_17767'>set a shield upon her shoulder; and therewith she mounted upon his</a>
<a id='line_17768'>horse, and gat a naked sword in her hand, and she thrust unto Alisander</a>
<a id='line_17769'>with all her might, and she gave him such a buffet that he thought the</a>
<a id='line_17770'>fire flew out of his eyen. And when Alisander felt that stroke he</a>
<a id='line_17771'>looked about him, and drew his sword. And when she saw that, she fled,</a>
<a id='line_17772'>and so did Mordred into the forest, and the damosel fled into the</a>
<a id='line_17773'>pavilion. So when Alisander understood himself how the false knight</a>
<a id='line_17774'>would have shamed him had not the damosel been then was he wroth with</a>
<a id='line_17775'>himself that Sir Mordred was so escaped his hands. But then Sir</a>
<a id='line_17776'>Alisander and Alice had good game at the damosel, how sadly she hit him</a>
<a id='line_17777'>upon the helm.</a>
<a id='line_17778'></a>
<a id='line_17779'>Then Sir Alisander jousted thus day by day, and on foot he did many</a>
<a id='line_17780'>battles with many knights of King Arthur’s court, and with many knights</a>
<a id='line_17781'>strangers. Therefore to tell all the battles that he did it were</a>
<a id='line_17782'>overmuch to rehearse, for every day within that twelvemonth he had ado</a>
<a id='line_17783'>with one knight or with other, and some day he had ado with three or</a>
<a id='line_17784'>with four; and there was never knight that put him to the worse. And at</a>
<a id='line_17785'>the twelvemonth’s end he departed with his lady, Alice la Beale</a>
<a id='line_17786'>Pilgrim. And the damosel would never go from him, and so they went into</a>
<a id='line_17787'>their country of Benoye, and lived there in great joy.</a>
<a id='line_17788'></a>

<a id='line_17794'></a>
<a id='line_17795'></a>
<a id='line_17796'>But as the book saith, King Mark would never stint till he had slain</a>
<a id='line_17797'>him by treason. And by Alice he gat a child that hight Bellengerus le</a>
<a id='line_17798'>Beuse. And by good fortune he came to the court of King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_17799'>proved a passing good knight; and he revenged his father’s death, for</a>
<a id='line_17800'>the false King Mark slew both Sir Tristram and Alisander falsely and</a>
<a id='line_17801'>feloniously. And it happed so that Alisander had never grace nor</a>
<a id='line_17802'>fortune to come to King Arthur’s court. For an he had come to Sir</a>
<a id='line_17803'>Launcelot, all knights said that knew him, he was one of the strongest</a>
<a id='line_17804'>knights that was in Arthur’s days, and great dole was made for him. So</a>
<a id='line_17805'>let we of him pass, and turn we to another tale.</a>
<a id='line_17806'></a>
<a id='line_17807'>So it befell that Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was lord of the</a>
<a id='line_17808'>country of Surluse, whereof came many good knights. And this noble</a>
<a id='line_17809'>prince was a passing good man of arms, and ever he held a noble</a>
<a id='line_17810'>fellowship together. And then he came to Arthur’s court and told him</a>
<a id='line_17811'>his intent, how this was his will, how he would let cry a jousts in the</a>
<a id='line_17812'>country of Surluse, the which country was within the lands of King</a>
<a id='line_17813'>Arthur, and there he asked leave to let cry a jousts. I will give you</a>
<a id='line_17814'>leave, said King Arthur; but wit thou well, said King Arthur, I may not</a>
<a id='line_17815'>be there. Sir, said Queen Guenever, please it you to give me leave to</a>
<a id='line_17816'>be at that jousts. With right good will, said Arthur; for Sir Galahalt,</a>
<a id='line_17817'>the haut prince, shall have you in governance. Sir, said Galahalt, I</a>
<a id='line_17818'>will as ye will. Sir, then the queen, I will take with me [Sir</a>
<a id='line_17819'>Launcelot] and such knights as please me best. Do as ye list, said King</a>
<a id='line_17820'>Arthur. So anon she commanded Sir Launcelot to make him ready with such</a>
<a id='line_17821'>knights as he thought best.</a>
<a id='line_17822'></a>
<a id='line_17823'>So in every good town and castle of this land was made a cry, that in</a>
<a id='line_17824'>the country of Surluse Sir Galahalt should make a joust that should</a>
<a id='line_17825'>last eight days, and how the haut prince, with the help of Queen</a>
<a id='line_17826'>Guenever’s knights, should joust against all manner of men that would</a>
<a id='line_17827'>come. When this cry was known, kings and princes, dukes and earls,</a>
<a id='line_17828'>barons and noble knights, made them ready to be at that jousts. And at</a>
<a id='line_17829'>the day of jousting there came in Sir Dinadan disguised, and did many</a>
<a id='line_17830'>great deeds of arms.</a>
<a id='line_17831'></a>
<a id='line_17832'></a>
<a id='line_17833'></a>
<a id='line_17834'></a>
<a id='line_17835'>CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Launcelot fought in the tournament, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_17836'>Palomides did arms there for a damosel.</a>
<a id='line_17837'></a>
<a id='line_17838'></a>
<a id='line_17839'>Then at the request of Queen Guenever and of King Bagdemagus Sir</a>
<a id='line_17840'>Launcelot came into the range, but he was disguised, and that was the</a>
<a id='line_17841'>cause that few folk knew him; and there met with him Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_17842'>Maris, his own brother, and either brake their spears upon other to</a>
<a id='line_17843'>their hands. And then either gat another spear. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_17844'>smote down Sir Ector de Maris, his own brother. That saw Sir Bleoberis,</a>
<a id='line_17845'>and he smote Sir Launcelot such a buffet upon the helm that he wist not</a>
<a id='line_17846'>well where he was. Then Sir Launcelot was wrothy and smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_17847'>Bleoberis so sore upon the helm that his head bowed down backward. And</a>
<a id='line_17848'>he smote eft another buffet, that he avoided his saddle; and so he rode</a>
<a id='line_17849'>by, and thrust forth to the thickest. When the King of Northgalis saw</a>
<a id='line_17850'>Sir Ector and Bleoberis lie on the ground then was he wroth, for they</a>
<a id='line_17851'>came on his party against them of Surluse. So the King of Northgalis</a>
<a id='line_17852'>ran to Sir Launcelot, and brake a spear upon him all to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_17853'>Therewith Sir Launcelot overtook the King of Northgalis, and smote him</a>
<a id='line_17854'>such a buffet on the helm with his sword that he made him to avoid his</a>
<a id='line_17855'>horse; and anon the king was horsed again. So both the King Bagdemagus’</a>
<a id='line_17856'>and the King of Northgalis’ party hurled to other; and then began a</a>
<a id='line_17857'>strong medley, but they of Northgalis were far bigger.</a>
<a id='line_17858'></a>
<a id='line_17859'>When Sir Launcelot saw his party go to the worst he thrang into the</a>
<a id='line_17860'>thickest press with a sword in his hand; and there he smote down on the</a>
<a id='line_17861'>right hand and on the left hand, and pulled down knights and raced off</a>
<a id='line_17862'>their helms, that all men had wonder that ever one knight might do such</a>
<a id='line_17863'>deeds of arms. When Sir Meliagaunce, that was son unto King Bagdemagus,</a>
<a id='line_17864'>saw how Sir Launcelot fared he marvelled greatly. And when he</a>
<a id='line_17865'>understood that it was he, he wist well that he was disguised for his</a>
<a id='line_17866'>sake. Then Sir Meliagaunce prayed a knight to slay Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_17867'>horse, either with sword or with spear. At that time King Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_17868'>met with a knight that hight Sauseise, a good knight, to whom he said:</a>
<a id='line_17869'>Now fair Sauseise, encounter with my son Meliagaunce and give him large</a>
<a id='line_17870'>payment, for I would he were well beaten of thy hands, that he might</a>
<a id='line_17871'>depart out of this field. And then Sir Sauseise encountered with Sir</a>
<a id='line_17872'>Meliagaunce, and either smote other down. And then they fought on foot,</a>
<a id='line_17873'>and there Sauseise had won Sir Meliagaunce, had there not come rescues.</a>
<a id='line_17874'>So then the haut prince blew to lodging, and every knight unarmed him</a>
<a id='line_17875'>and went to the great feast.</a>
<a id='line_17876'></a>
<a id='line_17877'>Then in the meanwhile there came a damosel to the haut prince, and</a>
<a id='line_17878'>complained that there was a knight that hight Goneries that withheld</a>
<a id='line_17879'>her all her lands. Then the knight was there present, and cast his</a>
<a id='line_17880'>glove to her or to any that would fight in her name. So the damosel</a>
<a id='line_17881'>took up the glove all heavily for default of a champion. Then there</a>
<a id='line_17882'>came a varlet to her and said: Damosel, will ye do after me? Full fain,</a>
<a id='line_17883'>said the damosel. Then go you unto such a knight that lieth here beside</a>
<a id='line_17884'>in an hermitage, and that followeth the Questing Beast, and pray him to</a>
<a id='line_17885'>take the battle upon him, and anon I wot well he will grant you.</a>
<a id='line_17886'></a>
<a id='line_17887'>So anon she took her palfrey, and within a while she found that knight,</a>
<a id='line_17888'>that was Sir Palomides. And when she required him he armed him and rode</a>
<a id='line_17889'>with her, and made her to go to the haut prince, and to ask leave for</a>
<a id='line_17890'>her knight to do battle. I will well, said the haut prince. Then the</a>
<a id='line_17891'>knights were ready in the field to joust on horseback; and either gat a</a>
<a id='line_17892'>spear in their hands, and met so fiercely together that their spears</a>
<a id='line_17893'>all to-shivered. Then they flang out swords, and Sir Palomides smote</a>
<a id='line_17894'>Sir Goneries down to the earth. And then he raced off his helm and</a>
<a id='line_17895'>smote off his head. Then they went to supper, and the damosel loved</a>
<a id='line_17896'>Palomides as paramour, but the book saith she was of his kin. So then</a>
<a id='line_17897'>Palomides disguised himself in this manner, in his shield he bare the</a>
<a id='line_17898'>Questing Beast, and in all his trappings. And when he was thus ready,</a>
<a id='line_17899'>he sent to the haut prince to give him leave to joust with other</a>
<a id='line_17900'>knights, but he was adoubted of Sir Launcelot. The haut prince sent him</a>
<a id='line_17901'>word again that he should be welcome, and that Sir Launcelot should not</a>
<a id='line_17902'>joust with him. Then Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, let cry what knight</a>
<a id='line_17903'>somever he were that smote down Sir Palomides should have his damosel</a>
<a id='line_17904'>to himself.</a>
<a id='line_17905'></a>
<a id='line_17906'></a>
<a id='line_17907'></a>
<a id='line_17908'></a>
<a id='line_17909'>CHAPTER XLII. How Sir Galahalt and Palomides fought together, and of</a>
<a id='line_17910'>Sir Dinadan and Sir Galahalt.</a>
<a id='line_17911'></a>
<a id='line_17912'></a>
<a id='line_17913'>Here beginneth the second day. Anon as Sir Palomides came into the</a>
<a id='line_17914'>field, Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was at the range end, and met</a>
<a id='line_17915'>with Sir Palomides, and he with him, with great spears. And then they</a>
<a id='line_17916'>came so hard together that their spears all to-shivered, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_17917'>Galahalt smote him so hard that he bare him backward over his horse,</a>
<a id='line_17918'>but yet he lost not his stirrups. Then they drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_17919'>lashed together many sad strokes, that many worshipful knights left</a>
<a id='line_17920'>their business to behold them. But at the last Sir Galahalt, the haut</a>
<a id='line_17921'>prince, smote a stroke of might unto Palomides, sore upon the helm; but</a>
<a id='line_17922'>the helm was so hard that the sword might not bite, but slipped and</a>
<a id='line_17923'>smote off the head of the horse of Sir Palomides. When the haut prince</a>
<a id='line_17924'>wist and saw the good knight fall unto the earth he was ashamed of that</a>
<a id='line_17925'>stroke. And therewith he alighted down off his own horse, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_17926'>the good knight, Palomides, to take that horse of his gift, and to</a>
<a id='line_17927'>forgive him that deed. Sir, said Palomides, I thank you of your great</a>
<a id='line_17928'>goodness, for ever of a man of worship a knight shall never have</a>
<a id='line_17929'>disworship; and so he mounted upon that horse, and the haut prince had</a>
<a id='line_17930'>another anon. Now, said the haut prince, I release to you that maiden,</a>
<a id='line_17931'>for ye have won her. Ah, said Palomides, the damosel and I be at your</a>
<a id='line_17932'>commandment.</a>
<a id='line_17933'></a>
<a id='line_17934'>So they departed, and Sir Galahalt did great deeds of arms. And right</a>
<a id='line_17935'>so came Dinadan and encountered with Sir Galahalt, and either came to</a>
<a id='line_17936'>other so fast with their spears that their spears brake to their hands.</a>
<a id='line_17937'>But Dinadan had weened the haut prince had been more weary than he was.</a>
<a id='line_17938'>And then he smote many sad strokes at the haut prince; but when Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_17939'>saw he might not get him to the earth he said: My lord, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_17940'>leave me, and take another. The haut prince knew not Dinadan, and left</a>
<a id='line_17941'>goodly for his fair words. And so they departed; but soon there came</a>
<a id='line_17942'>another and told the haut prince that it was Dinadan. Forsooth, said</a>
<a id='line_17943'>the prince, therefore am I heavy that he is so escaped from me, for</a>
<a id='line_17944'>with his mocks and japes now shall I never have done with him. And then</a>
<a id='line_17945'>Galahalt rode fast after him, and bade him: Abide, Dinadan, for King</a>
<a id='line_17946'>Arthur’s sake. Nay, said Dinadan, so God me help, we meet no more</a>
<a id='line_17947'>together this day. Then in that wrath the haut prince met with</a>
<a id='line_17948'>Meliagaunce, and he smote him in the throat that an he had fallen his</a>
<a id='line_17949'>neck had broken; and with the same spear he smote down another knight.</a>
<a id='line_17950'>Then came in they of Northgalis and many strangers, and were like to</a>
<a id='line_17951'>have put them of Surluse to the worse, for Sir Galahalt, the haut</a>
<a id='line_17952'>prince, had ever much in hand. So there came the good knight, Semound</a>
<a id='line_17953'>the Valiant, with forty knights, and he beat them all aback. Then the</a>
<a id='line_17954'>Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot let blow to lodging, and every knight</a>
<a id='line_17955'>unarmed him, and dressed him to the feast.</a>
<a id='line_17956'></a>

<a id='line_17959'></a>
<a id='line_17960'>CHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Archade appealed Sir Palomides of treason, and</a>
<a id='line_17961'>how Sir Palomides slew him.</a>
<a id='line_17962'></a>
<a id='line_17963'></a>
<a id='line_17964'>When Palomides was unarmed he asked lodging for himself and the</a>
<a id='line_17965'>damosel. Anon the haut prince commanded them to lodging. And he was not</a>
<a id='line_17966'>so soon in his lodging but there came a knight that hight Archade, he</a>
<a id='line_17967'>was brother unto Goneries that Palomides slew afore in the damosel’s</a>
<a id='line_17968'>quarrel. And this knight, Archade, called Sir Palomides traitor, and</a>
<a id='line_17969'>appealed him for the death of his brother. By the leave of the haut</a>
<a id='line_17970'>prince, said Palomides, I shall answer thee. When Sir Galahalt</a>
<a id='line_17971'>understood their quarrel he bade them go to dinner: And as soon as ye</a>
<a id='line_17972'>have dined look that either knight be ready in the field. So when they</a>
<a id='line_17973'>had dined they were armed both, and took their horses, and the queen,</a>
<a id='line_17974'>and the prince, and Sir Launcelot, were set to behold them; and so they</a>
<a id='line_17975'>let run their horses, and there Sir Palomides bare Archade on his spear</a>
<a id='line_17976'>over his horse’s tail. And then Palomides alighted and drew his sword,</a>
<a id='line_17977'>but Sir Archade might not arise; and there Sir Palomides raced off his</a>
<a id='line_17978'>helm, and smote off his head. Then the haut prince and Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_17979'>went unto supper. Then King Bagdemagus sent away his son Meliagaunce</a>
<a id='line_17980'>because Sir Launcelot should not meet with him, for he hated Sir</a>
<a id='line_17981'>Launcelot, and that knew he not.</a>

<a id='line_17987'>Lamorak, and other things.</a>
<a id='line_17988'></a>
<a id='line_17989'></a>
<a id='line_17990'>Now beginneth the third day of jousting; and at that day King</a>
<a id='line_17991'>Bagdemagus made him ready; and there came against him King Marsil, that</a>
<a id='line_17992'>had in gift an island of Sir Galahalt the haut prince; and this island</a>
<a id='line_17993'>had the name Pomitain. Then it befell that King Bagdemagus and King</a>
<a id='line_17994'>Marsil of Pomitain met together with spears, and King Marsil had such a</a>
<a id='line_17995'>buffet that he fell over his horse’s croup. Then came there in a knight</a>
<a id='line_17996'>of King Marsil to revenge his lord, and King Bagdemagus smote him down,</a>
<a id='line_17997'>horse and man, to the earth. So there came an earl that hight Arrouse,</a>
<a id='line_17998'>and Sir Breuse, and an hundred knights with them of Pomitain, and the</a>
<a id='line_17999'>King of Northgalis was with them; and all these were against them of</a>
<a id='line_18000'>Surluse. And then there began great battle, and many knights were cast</a>
<a id='line_18001'>under horses’ feet. And ever King Bagdemagus did best, for he first</a>
<a id='line_18002'>began, and ever he held on. Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, smote ever at</a>
<a id='line_18003'>the face of King Bagdemagus; and at the last King Bagdemagus hurtled</a>
<a id='line_18004'>down Gaheris, horse and man.</a>
<a id='line_18005'></a>
<a id='line_18006'>Then by adventure Sir Palomides, the good knight, met with Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_18007'>de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis’ brother. And either smote other with great</a>
<a id='line_18008'>spears, that both their horses and knights fell to the earth. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_18009'>Blamore had such a fall that he had almost broken his neck, for the</a>
<a id='line_18010'>blood brast out at nose, mouth, and his ears, but at the last he</a>
<a id='line_18011'>recovered well by good surgeons. Then there came in the Duke Chaleins</a>
<a id='line_18012'>of Clarance; and in his governance there came a knight that hight Elis</a>
<a id='line_18013'>la Noire; and there encountered with him King Bagdemagus, and he smote</a>
<a id='line_18014'>Elis that he made him to avoid his saddle. So the Duke Chaleins of</a>
<a id='line_18015'>Clarance did there great deeds of arms, and of so late as he came in</a>
<a id='line_18016'>the third day there was no man did so well except King Bagdemagus and</a>
<a id='line_18017'>Sir Palomides, that the prize was given that day to King Bagdemagus.</a>
<a id='line_18018'>And then they blew unto lodging, and unarmed them, and went to the</a>
<a id='line_18019'>feast. Right so came Dinadan, and mocked and japed with King Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_18020'>that all knights laughed at him, for he was a fine japer, and well</a>
<a id='line_18021'>loving all good knights.</a>
<a id='line_18022'></a>
<a id='line_18023'>So anon as they had dined there came a varlet bearing four spears on</a>
<a id='line_18024'>his back; and he came to Palomides, and said thus: Here is a knight by</a>
<a id='line_18025'>hath sent you the choice of four spears, and requireth you for your</a>
<a id='line_18026'>lady’s sake to take that one half of these spears, and joust with him</a>
<a id='line_18027'>in the field. Tell him, said Palomides, I will not fail him. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_18028'>Galahalt wist of this, he bade Palomides make him ready. So the Queen</a>
<a id='line_18029'>Guenever, the haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, they were set upon</a>
<a id='line_18030'>scaffolds to give the judgment of these two knights. Then Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_18031'>and the strange knight ran so eagerly together that their spears brake</a>
<a id='line_18032'>to their hands. Anon withal either of them took a great spear in his</a>
<a id='line_18033'>hand and all to-shivered them in pieces. And then either took a greater</a>
<a id='line_18034'>spear, and then the knight smote down Sir Palomides, horse and man, to</a>
<a id='line_18035'>the earth. And as he would have passed over him the strange knight’s</a>
<a id='line_18036'>horse stumbled and fell down upon Palomides. Then they drew their</a>
<a id='line_18037'>swords and lashed together wonderly sore a great while.</a>
<a id='line_18038'></a>
<a id='line_18039'>Then the haut prince and Sir Launcelot said they saw never two knights</a>
<a id='line_18040'>fight better than they did; but ever the strange knight doubled his</a>
<a id='line_18041'>strokes, and put Palomides aback; therewithal the haut prince cried:</a>
<a id='line_18042'>Ho: and then they went to lodging. And when they were unarmed they knew</a>
<a id='line_18043'>it was the noble knight Sir Lamorak. When Sir Launcelot knew that it</a>
<a id='line_18044'>was Sir Lamorak he made much of him, for above all earthly men he loved</a>
<a id='line_18045'>him best except Sir Tristram. Then Queen Guenever commended him, and so</a>
<a id='line_18046'>did all other good knights make much of him, except Sir Gawaine’s</a>
<a id='line_18047'>brethren. Then Queen Guenever said unto Sir Launcelot: Sir, I require</a>
<a id='line_18048'>you that an ye joust any more, that ye joust with none of the blood of</a>
<a id='line_18049'>my lord Arthur. So he promised he would not as at that time.</a>

<a id='line_18055'></a>
<a id='line_18056'></a>
<a id='line_18057'>Here beginneth the fourth day. Then came into the field the King with</a>
<a id='line_18058'>the Hundred Knights, and all they of Northgalis, and the Duke Chaleins</a>
<a id='line_18059'>of Clarance, and King Marsil of Pomitain, and there came Safere,</a>
<a id='line_18060'>Palomides’ brother, and there he told him tidings of his mother. And</a>
<a id='line_18061'>his name was called the Earl, and so he appealed him afore King Arthur:</a>
<a id='line_18062'>For he made war upon our father and mother, and there I slew him in</a>
<a id='line_18063'>plain battle. So they went into the field, and the damosel with them;</a>
<a id='line_18064'>and there came to encounter again them Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_18065'>Ector de Maris. Sir Palomides encountered with Sir Bleoberis, and</a>
<a id='line_18066'>either smote other down. And in the same wise did Sir Safere and Sir</a>
<a id='line_18067'>Ector, and the two couples did battle on foot. Then came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_18068'>Lamorak, and he encountered with the King with the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_18069'>smote him quite over his horse’s tail. And in the same wise he served</a>
<a id='line_18070'>the King of Northgalis, and also he smote down King Marsil. And so or</a>
<a id='line_18071'>ever he stint he smote down with his spear and with his sword thirty</a>
<a id='line_18072'>knights. When Duke Chaleins saw Lamorak do so great prowess he would</a>
<a id='line_18073'>not meddle with him for shame; and then he charged all his knights in</a>
<a id='line_18074'>pain of death that none of you touch him; for it were shame to all good</a>
<a id='line_18075'>knights an that knight were shamed.</a>
<a id='line_18076'></a>
<a id='line_18077'>Then the two kings gathered them together, and all they set upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_18078'>Lamorak; and he failed them not, but rushed here and there, smiting on</a>
<a id='line_18079'>the right hand and on the left, and raced off many helms, so that the</a>
<a id='line_18080'>haut prince and Queen Guenever said they saw never knight do such deeds</a>
<a id='line_18081'>of arms on horseback. Alas, said Launcelot to King Bagdemagus, I will</a>
<a id='line_18082'>arm me and help Sir Lamorak. And I will ride with you, said King</a>
<a id='line_18083'>Bagdemagus. And when they two were horsed they came to Sir Lamorak that</a>
<a id='line_18084'>stood among thirty knights; and well was him that might reach him a</a>
<a id='line_18085'>buffet, and ever he smote again mightily. Then came there into the</a>
<a id='line_18086'>press Sir Launcelot, and he threw down Sir Mador de la Porte. And with</a>
<a id='line_18087'>the truncheon of that spear he threw down many knights. And King</a>
<a id='line_18088'>Bagdemagus smote on the left hand and on the right hand marvellously</a>
<a id='line_18089'>well. And then the three kings fled aback. Therewithal then Sir</a>
<a id='line_18090'>Galahalt let blow to lodging, and all the heralds gave Sir Lamorak the</a>
<a id='line_18091'>prize. And all this while fought Palomides, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Safere,</a>
<a id='line_18092'>Sir Ector on foot; never were there four knights evener matched. And</a>
<a id='line_18093'>then they were departed, and had unto their lodging, and unarmed them,</a>
<a id='line_18094'>and so they went to the great feast.</a>
<a id='line_18095'></a>
<a id='line_18096'>But when Sir Lamorak was come into the court Queen Guenever took him in</a>
<a id='line_18097'>her arms and said: Sir, well have ye done this day. Then came the haut</a>
<a id='line_18098'>prince, and he made of him great joy, and so did Dinadan, for he wept</a>
<a id='line_18099'>for joy; but the joy that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Lamorak there might</a>
<a id='line_18100'>no man tell. Then they went unto rest, and on the morn the haut prince</a>
<a id='line_18101'>let blow unto the field.</a>
<a id='line_18102'></a>
<a id='line_18103'></a>
<a id='line_18104'></a>
<a id='line_18105'></a>
<a id='line_18106'>CHAPTER XLVI. Of the Fifth day, and how Sir Lamorak behaved him.</a>
<a id='line_18107'></a>
<a id='line_18108'></a>
<a id='line_18109'>Here beginneth the fifth day. So it befell that Sir Palomides came in</a>
<a id='line_18110'>the morntide, and proffered to joust thereas King Arthur was in a</a>
<a id='line_18111'>castle there besides Surluse; and there encountered with him a</a>
<a id='line_18112'>worshipful duke, and there Sir Palomides smote him over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_18113'>croup. And this duke was uncle unto King Arthur. Then Sir Elise’s son</a>
<a id='line_18114'>rode unto Palomides, and Palomides served Elise in the same wise. When</a>
<a id='line_18115'>Sir Uwaine saw this he was wroth. Then he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_18116'>encountered with Sir Palomides, and Palomides smote him so hard that he</a>
<a id='line_18117'>went to the earth, horse and man. And for to make a short tale, he</a>
<a id='line_18118'>smote down three brethren of Sir Gawaine, that is for to say Mordred,</a>
<a id='line_18119'>Gaheris, and Agravaine. O Jesu, said Arthur, this is a great despite of</a>
<a id='line_18120'>a Saracen that he shall smite down my blood. And therewithal King</a>
<a id='line_18121'>Arthur was wood wroth, and thought to have made him ready to joust.</a>
<a id='line_18122'></a>
<a id='line_18123'>That espied Sir Lamorak, that Arthur and his blood were discomfit; and</a>
<a id='line_18124'>anon he was ready, and asked Palomides if he would any more joust. Why</a>
<a id='line_18125'>should I not? said Palomides. Then they hurtled together, and brake</a>
<a id='line_18126'>their spears, and all to-shivered them, that all the castle rang of</a>
<a id='line_18127'>their dints. Then either gat a greater spear in his hand, and they came</a>
<a id='line_18128'>so fiercely together; but Sir Palomides’ spear all to-brast and Sir</a>
<a id='line_18129'>Lamorak’s did hold. Therewithal Sir Palomides lost his stirrups and lay</a>
<a id='line_18130'>upright on his horse’s back. And then Sir Palomides returned again and</a>
<a id='line_18131'>took his damosel, and Sir Safere returned his way.</a>
<a id='line_18132'></a>
<a id='line_18133'>So, when he was departed, King Arthur came to Sir Lamorak and thanked</a>
<a id='line_18134'>him of his goodness, and prayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_18135'>Lamorak, wit thou well, I owe you my service, but as at this time I</a>
<a id='line_18136'>will not abide here, for I see of mine enemies many about me. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_18137'>said Arthur, now wot I well it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. O Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_18138'>abide with me, and by my crown I shall never fail thee: and not so</a>
<a id='line_18139'>hardy in Gawaine’s head, nor none of his brethren, to do thee any</a>
<a id='line_18140'>wrong. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, wrong have they done me, and to you both.</a>
<a id='line_18141'>That is truth, said the king, for they slew their own mother and my</a>
<a id='line_18142'>sister, the which me sore grieveth: it had been much fairer and better</a>
<a id='line_18143'>that ye had wedded her, for ye are a king’s son as well as they. O</a>
<a id='line_18144'>Jesu, said the noble knight Sir Lamorak unto Arthur, her death shall I</a>
<a id='line_18145'>never forget. I promise you, and make mine avow unto God, I shall</a>
<a id='line_18146'>revenge her death as soon as I see time convenable. And if it were not</a>
<a id='line_18147'>at the reverence of your highness I should now have been revenged upon</a>
<a id='line_18148'>Sir Gawaine and his brethren. Truly, said Arthur, I will make you at</a>
<a id='line_18149'>accord. Sir, said Lamorak, as at this time I may not abide with you,</a>
<a id='line_18150'>for I must to the jousts, where is Sir Launcelot, and the haut prince</a>
<a id='line_18151'>Sir Galahalt.</a>
<a id='line_18152'></a>
<a id='line_18153'>Then there was a damosel that was daughter to King Bandes. And there</a>
<a id='line_18154'>was a Saracen knight that hight Corsabrin, and he loved the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_18155'>and in no wise he would suffer her to be married; for ever this</a>
<a id='line_18156'>Corsabrin noised her, and named her that she was out of her mind; and</a>
<a id='line_18157'>thus he let her that she might not be married.</a>
<a id='line_18158'></a>
<a id='line_18159'></a>
<a id='line_18160'></a>
<a id='line_18161'></a>
<a id='line_18162'>CHAPTER XLVII. How Sir Palomides fought with Corsabrin for a lady, and</a>
<a id='line_18163'>how Palomides slew Corsabrin.</a>
<a id='line_18164'></a>
<a id='line_18165'></a>
<a id='line_18166'>So by fortune this damosel heard tell that Palomides did much for</a>
<a id='line_18167'>damosels’ sake; so she sent to him a pensel, and prayed him to fight</a>
<a id='line_18168'>with Sir Corsabrin for her love, and he should have her and her lands</a>
<a id='line_18169'>of her father’s that should fall to her. Then the damosel sent unto</a>
<a id='line_18170'>Corsabrin, and bade him go unto Sir Palomides that was a paynim as well</a>
<a id='line_18171'>as he, and she gave him warning that she had sent him her pensel, and</a>
<a id='line_18172'>if he might overcome Palomides she would wed him. When Corsabrin wist</a>
<a id='line_18173'>of her deeds then was he wood wroth and angry, and rode unto Surluse</a>
<a id='line_18174'>where the haut prince was, and there he found Sir Palomides ready, the</a>
<a id='line_18175'>which had the pensel. So there they waged battle either with other</a>
<a id='line_18176'>afore Galahalt. Well, said the haut prince, this day must noble knights</a>
<a id='line_18177'>joust, and at-after dinner we shall see how ye can speed.</a>
<a id='line_18178'></a>
<a id='line_18179'>Then they blew to jousts; and in came Dinadan, and met with Sir Gerin,</a>
<a id='line_18180'>a good knight, and he threw him down over his horse’s croup; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_18181'>Dinadan overthrew four knights more; and there he did great deeds of</a>
<a id='line_18182'>arms, for he was a good knight, but he was a scoffer and a japer, and</a>
<a id='line_18183'>the merriest knight among fellowship that was that time living. And he</a>
<a id='line_18184'>had such a custom that he loved every good knight, and every good</a>
<a id='line_18185'>knight loved him again. So then when the haut prince saw Dinadan do so</a>
<a id='line_18186'>well, he sent unto Sir Launcelot and bade him strike down Sir Dinadan:</a>
<a id='line_18187'>And when that ye have done so bring him afore me and the noble Queen</a>
<a id='line_18188'>Guenever. Then Sir Launcelot did as he was required. Then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_18189'>and he smote down many knights, and raced off helms, and drove all the</a>
<a id='line_18190'>knights afore them. And so Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Dinadan, and</a>
<a id='line_18191'>made his men to unarm him, and so brought him to the queen and the haut</a>
<a id='line_18192'>prince, and they laughed at Dinadan so sore that they might not stand.</a>
<a id='line_18193'>Well, said Sir Dinadan, yet have I no shame, for the old shrew, Sir</a>
<a id='line_18194'>Launcelot, smote me down. So they went to dinner, [and] all the court</a>
<a id='line_18195'>had good sport at Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_18196'></a>
<a id='line_18197'>Then when the dinner was done they blew to the field to behold Sir</a>
<a id='line_18198'>Palomides and Corsabrin. Sir Palomides pight his pensel in midst of the</a>
<a id='line_18199'>field; and then they hurtled together with their spears as it were</a>
<a id='line_18200'>thunder, and either smote other to the earth. And then they pulled out</a>
<a id='line_18201'>their swords, and dressed their shields, and lashed together mightily</a>
<a id='line_18202'>as mighty knights, that well-nigh there was no piece of harness would</a>
<a id='line_18203'>hold them, for this Corsabrin was a passing felonious knight.</a>
<a id='line_18204'>Corsabrin, said Palomides, wilt thou release me yonder damosel and the</a>
<a id='line_18205'>pensel? Then was Corsabrin wroth out of measure, and gave Palomides</a>
<a id='line_18206'>such a buffet that he kneeled on his knee. Then Palomides arose</a>
<a id='line_18207'>lightly, and smote him upon the helm that he fell down right to the</a>
<a id='line_18208'>earth. And therewith he raced off his helm and said: Corsabrin, yield</a>
<a id='line_18209'>thee or else thou shalt die of my hands. Fie on thee, said Corsabrin,</a>
<a id='line_18210'>do thy worst. Then he smote off his head. And therewithal came a stink</a>
<a id='line_18211'>of his body when the soul departed, that there might nobody abide the</a>
<a id='line_18212'>savour. So was the corpse had away and buried in a wood, because he was</a>
<a id='line_18213'>a paynim. Then they blew unto lodging, and Palomides was unarmed.</a>
<a id='line_18214'></a>
<a id='line_18215'>Then he went unto Queen Guenever, to the haut prince, and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_18216'>Launcelot. Sir, said the haut prince, here have ye seen this day a</a>
<a id='line_18217'>great miracle by Corsabrin, what savour there was when the soul</a>
<a id='line_18218'>departed from the body. Therefore, sir, we will require you to take the</a>
<a id='line_18219'>baptism upon you, and I promise you all knights will set the more by</a>
<a id='line_18220'>you, and say more worship by you. Sir, said Palomides, I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_18221'>all know that into this land I came to be christened, and in my heart I</a>
<a id='line_18222'>am christened and christened will I be. But I have made such an avow</a>
<a id='line_18223'>that I may not be christened till I have done seven true battles for</a>
<a id='line_18224'>Jesu’s sake, and then will I be christened; and I trust God will take</a>
<a id='line_18225'>mine intent, for I mean truly. Then Sir Palomides prayed Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_18226'>and the haut prince to sup with him. And so they did, both Sir</a>
<a id='line_18227'>Launcelot and Sir Lamorak, and many other good knights. So on the morn</a>
<a id='line_18228'>they heard their mass, and blew the field, and then knights made them</a>
<a id='line_18229'>ready.</a>
<a id='line_18230'></a>
<a id='line_18231'></a>
<a id='line_18232'></a>
<a id='line_18233'></a>
<a id='line_18234'>CHAPTER XLVIII. Of the sixth day, and what then was done.</a>
<a id='line_18235'></a>
<a id='line_18236'></a>
<a id='line_18237'>Here beginneth the sixth day. Then came therein Sir Gaheris, and there</a>
<a id='line_18238'>encountered with him Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and Sir Gaheris smote him</a>
<a id='line_18239'>over his horse’s croup. And then either party encountered with other,</a>
<a id='line_18240'>and there were many spears broken, and many knights cast under feet. So</a>
<a id='line_18241'>there came in Sir Dornard and Sir Aglovale, that were brethren unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_18242'>Lamorak, and they met with other two knights, and either smote other so</a>
<a id='line_18243'>hard that all four knights and horses fell to the earth. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_18244'>Lamorak saw his two brethren down he was wroth out of measure, and then</a>
<a id='line_18245'>he gat a great spear in his hand, and therewithal he smote down four</a>
<a id='line_18246'>good knights, and then his spear brake. Then he pulled out his sword,</a>
<a id='line_18247'>and smote about him on the right hand and on the left hand, and raced</a>
<a id='line_18248'>off helms and pulled down knights, that all men marvelled of such deeds</a>
<a id='line_18249'>of arms as he did, for he fared so that many knights fled. Then he</a>
<a id='line_18250'>horsed his brethren again, and said: Brethren, ye ought to be ashamed</a>
<a id='line_18251'>to fall so off your horses! what is a knight but when he is on</a>
<a id='line_18252'>horseback? I set not by a knight when he is on foot, for all battles on</a>
<a id='line_18253'>foot are but pillers’ battles. For there should no knight fight on foot</a>
<a id='line_18254'>but if it were for treason, or else he were driven thereto by force;</a>
<a id='line_18255'>therefore, brethren, sit fast on your horses, or else fight never more</a>
<a id='line_18256'>afore me.</a>
<a id='line_18257'></a>
<a id='line_18258'>With that came in the Duke Chaleins of Clarance, and there encountered</a>
<a id='line_18259'>with him the Earl Ulbawes of Surluse, and either of them smote other</a>
<a id='line_18260'>down. Then the knights of both parties horsed their lords again, for</a>
<a id='line_18261'>Sir Ector and Bleoberis were on foot, waiting on the Duke Chaleins. And</a>
<a id='line_18262'>the King with the Hundred Knights was with the Earl of Ulbawes. With</a>
<a id='line_18263'>that came Gaheris and lashed to the King with the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_18264'>he to him again. Then came the Duke Chaleins and departed them.</a>
<a id='line_18265'></a>
<a id='line_18266'>Then they blew to lodging, and the knights unarmed them and drew them</a>
<a id='line_18267'>to their dinner; and at the midst of their dinner in came Dinadan and</a>
<a id='line_18268'>began to rail. Then he beheld the haut prince, that seemed wroth with</a>
<a id='line_18269'>some fault that he saw; for he had a custom he loved no fish, and</a>
<a id='line_18270'>because he was served with fish, the which he hated, therefore he was</a>
<a id='line_18271'>not merry. When Sir Dinadan had espied the haut prince, he espied where</a>
<a id='line_18272'>was a fish with a great head, and that he gat betwixt two dishes, and</a>
<a id='line_18273'>served the haut prince with that fish. And then he said thus: Sir</a>
<a id='line_18274'>Galahalt, well may I liken you to a wolf, for he will never eat fish,</a>
<a id='line_18275'>but flesh; then the haut prince laughed at his words. Well, well, said</a>
<a id='line_18276'>Dinadan to Launcelot, what devil do ye in this country, for here may no</a>
<a id='line_18277'>mean knights win no worship for thee. Sir Dinadan, said Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_18278'>ensure thee I shall no more meet with thee nor with thy great spear,</a>
<a id='line_18279'>for I may not sit in my saddle when that spear hitteth me. And if I be</a>
<a id='line_18280'>happy I shall beware of that boistous body that thou bearest. Well,</a>
<a id='line_18281'>said Launcelot, make good watch ever: God forbid that ever we meet but</a>
<a id='line_18282'>if it be at a dish of meat. Then laughed the queen and the haut prince,</a>
<a id='line_18283'>that they might not sit at their table; thus they made great joy till</a>
<a id='line_18284'>on the morn, and then they heard mass, and blew to field. And Queen</a>
<a id='line_18285'>Guenever and all the estates were set, and judges armed clean with</a>
<a id='line_18286'>their shields to keep the right.</a>
<a id='line_18287'></a>
<a id='line_18288'></a>
<a id='line_18289'></a>
<a id='line_18290'></a>
<a id='line_18291'>CHAPTER XLIX. Of the seventh battle, and how Sir Launcelot, being</a>
<a id='line_18292'>disguised like a maid, smote down Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_18293'></a>
<a id='line_18294'></a>
<a id='line_18295'>Now beginneth the seventh battle. There came in the Duke Cambines, and</a>
<a id='line_18296'>there encountered with him Sir Aristance, that was counted a good</a>
<a id='line_18297'>knight, and they met so hard that either bare other down, horse and</a>
<a id='line_18298'>man. Then came there the Earl of Lambaile and helped the duke again to</a>
<a id='line_18299'>horse. Then came there Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and he smote the Earl</a>
<a id='line_18300'>Lambaile down from his horse. Then began they to do great deeds of</a>
<a id='line_18301'>arms, and many spears were broken, and many knights were cast to the</a>
<a id='line_18302'>earth. Then the King of Northgalis and the Earl Ulbawes smote together</a>
<a id='line_18303'>that all the judges thought it was like mortal death. This meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_18304'>Queen Guenever, and the haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, made there Sir</a>
<a id='line_18305'>Dinadan make him ready to joust. I would, said Dinadan, ride into the</a>
<a id='line_18306'>field, but then one of you twain will meet with me. Per dieu, said the</a>
<a id='line_18307'>haut prince, ye may see how we sit here as judges with our shields, and</a>
<a id='line_18308'>always mayest thou behold whether we sit here or not.</a>
<a id='line_18309'></a>
<a id='line_18310'>So Sir Dinadan departed and took his horse, and met with many knights,</a>
<a id='line_18311'>and did passing well. And as he was departed, Sir Launcelot disguised</a>
<a id='line_18312'>himself, and put upon his armour a maiden’s garment freshly attired.</a>
<a id='line_18313'>Then Sir Launcelot made Sir Galihodin to lead him through the range,</a>
<a id='line_18314'>and all men had wonder what damosel it was. And so as Sir Dinadan came</a>
<a id='line_18315'>into the range, Sir Launcelot, that was in the damosel’s array, gat</a>
<a id='line_18316'>Galihodin’s spear, and ran unto Sir Dinadan. And always Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_18317'>looked up thereas Sir Launcelot was, and then he saw one sit in the</a>
<a id='line_18318'>stead of Sir Launcelot, armed. But when Dinadan saw a manner of a</a>
<a id='line_18319'>damosel he dread perils that it was Sir Launcelot disguised, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_18320'>Launcelot came on him so fast that he smote him over his horse’s croup;</a>
<a id='line_18321'>and then with great scorns they gat Sir Dinadan into the forest there</a>
<a id='line_18322'>beside, and there they dispoiled him unto his shirt, and put upon him a</a>
<a id='line_18323'>woman’s garment, and so brought him into the field: and so they blew</a>
<a id='line_18324'>unto lodging. And every knight went and unarmed them. Then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_18325'>Dinadan brought in among them all. And when Queen Guenever saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_18326'>Dinadan brought so among them all, then she laughed that she fell down,</a>
<a id='line_18327'>and so did all that there were. Well, said Dinadan to Launcelot, thou</a>
<a id='line_18328'>art so false that I can never beware of thee. Then by all the assent</a>
<a id='line_18329'>they gave Sir Launcelot the prize, the next was Sir Lamorak de Galis,</a>
<a id='line_18330'>the third was Sir Palomides, the fourth was King Bagdemagus; so these</a>
<a id='line_18331'>four knights had the prize, and there was great joy, and great nobley</a>
<a id='line_18332'>in all the court.</a>
<a id='line_18333'></a>
<a id='line_18334'>And on the morn Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot departed unto King</a>
<a id='line_18335'>Arthur, but in no wise Sir Lamorak would not go with them. I shall</a>
<a id='line_18336'>undertake, said Sir Launcelot, that an ye will go with us King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_18337'>shall charge Sir Gawaine and his brethren never to do you hurt. As for</a>
<a id='line_18338'>that, said Sir Lamorak, I will not trust Sir Gawaine nor none of his</a>
<a id='line_18339'>brethren; and wit ye well, Sir Launcelot, an it were not for my lord</a>
<a id='line_18340'>King Arthur’s sake, I should match Sir Gawaine and his brethren well</a>
<a id='line_18341'>enough. But to say that I should trust them, that shall I never, and</a>
<a id='line_18342'>therefore I pray you recommend me unto my lord Arthur, and unto all my</a>
<a id='line_18343'>lords of the Round Table. And in what place that ever I come I shall do</a>
<a id='line_18344'>you service to my power: and sir, it is but late that I revenged that,</a>
<a id='line_18345'>when my lord Arthur’s kin were put to the worse by Sir Palomides. Then</a>
<a id='line_18346'>Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Launcelot, and either wept at their</a>
<a id='line_18347'>departing.</a>

<a id='line_18352'>CHAPTER L. How by treason Sir Tristram was brought to a tournament for</a>
<a id='line_18353'>to have been slain, and how he was put in prison.</a>
<a id='line_18354'></a>
<a id='line_18355'></a>
<a id='line_18356'>Now turn we from this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram, of whom</a>
<a id='line_18357'>this book is principally of, and leave we the king and the queen, Sir</a>
<a id='line_18358'>Launcelot, and Sir Lamorak, and here beginneth the treason of King</a>
<a id='line_18359'>Mark, that he ordained against Sir Tristram. There was cried by the</a>
<a id='line_18360'>coasts of Cornwall a great tournament and jousts, and all was done by</a>
<a id='line_18361'>Sir Galahalt the haut prince and King Bagdemagus, to the intent to slay</a>
<a id='line_18362'>Launcelot, or else utterly destroy him and shame him, because Sir</a>
<a id='line_18363'>Launcelot had always the higher degree, therefore this prince and this</a>
<a id='line_18364'>king made this jousts against Sir Launcelot. And thus their counsel was</a>
<a id='line_18365'>discovered unto King Mark, whereof he was full glad.</a>
<a id='line_18366'></a>
<a id='line_18367'>Then King Mark bethought him that he would have Sir Tristram unto that</a>
<a id='line_18368'>tournament disguised that no man should know him, to that intent that</a>
<a id='line_18369'>the haut prince should ween that Sir Tristram were Sir Launcelot. So at</a>
<a id='line_18370'>these jousts came in Sir Tristram. And at that time Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_18371'>not there, but when they saw a knight disguised do such deeds of arms,</a>
<a id='line_18372'>they weened it had been Sir Launcelot. And in especial King Mark said</a>
<a id='line_18373'>it was Sir Launcelot plainly. Then they set upon him, both King</a>
<a id='line_18374'>Bagdemagus, and the haut prince, and their knights, that it was wonder</a>
<a id='line_18375'>that ever Sir Tristram might endure that pain. Notwithstanding for all</a>
<a id='line_18376'>the pain that he had, Sir Tristram won the degree at that tournament,</a>
<a id='line_18377'>and there he hurt many knights and bruised them, and they hurt him and</a>
<a id='line_18378'>bruised him wonderly sore. So when the jousts were all done they knew</a>
<a id='line_18379'>well that it was Sir Tristram de Liones; and all that were on King</a>
<a id='line_18380'>Mark’s party were glad that Sir Tristram was hurt, and the remnant were</a>
<a id='line_18381'>sorry of his hurt; for Sir Tristram was not so behated as was Sir</a>
<a id='line_18382'>Launcelot within the realm of England.</a>
<a id='line_18383'></a>
<a id='line_18384'>Then came King Mark unto Sir Tristram and said: Fair nephew, I am sorry</a>
<a id='line_18385'>of your hurts. Gramercy my lord, said Sir Tristram. Then King Mark made</a>
<a id='line_18386'>Sir Tristram to be put in an horse bier in great sign of love, and</a>
<a id='line_18387'>said: Fair cousin, I shall be your leech myself. And so he rode forth</a>
<a id='line_18388'>with Sir Tristram, and brought him to a castle by daylight. And then</a>
<a id='line_18389'>King Mark made Sir Tristram to eat. And then after he gave him a drink,</a>
<a id='line_18390'>the which as soon as he had drunk he fell asleep. And when it was night</a>
<a id='line_18391'>he made him to be carried to another castle, and there he put him in a</a>
<a id='line_18392'>strong prison, and there he ordained a man and a woman to give him his</a>
<a id='line_18393'>meat and drink. So there he was a great while.</a>
<a id='line_18394'></a>
<a id='line_18395'>Then was Sir Tristram missed, and no creature wist where he was become.</a>
<a id='line_18396'>When La Beale Isoud heard how he was missed, privily she went unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_18397'>Sadok, and prayed him to espy where was Sir Tristram. Then when Sadok</a>
<a id='line_18398'>wist how Sir Tristram was missed, and anon espied that he was put in</a>
<a id='line_18399'>prison by King Mark and the traitors of Magouns, then Sadok and two of</a>
<a id='line_18400'>his cousins laid them in an ambushment, fast by the Castle of Tintagil,</a>
<a id='line_18401'>in arms. And as by fortune, there came riding King Mark and four of his</a>
<a id='line_18402'>nephews, and a certain of the traitors of Magouns. When Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_18403'>espied them he brake out of the bushment, and set there upon them. And</a>
<a id='line_18404'>when King Mark espied Sir Sadok he fled as fast as he might, and there</a>
<a id='line_18405'>Sir Sadok slew all the four nephews unto King Mark. But these traitors</a>
<a id='line_18406'>of Magouns slew one of Sadok’s cousins with a great wound in the neck,</a>
<a id='line_18407'>but Sadok smote the other to the death. Then Sir Sadok rode upon his</a>
<a id='line_18408'>way unto a castle that was called Liones, and there he espied of the</a>
<a id='line_18409'>treason and felony of King Mark. So they of that castle rode with Sir</a>
<a id='line_18410'>Sadok till that they came to a castle that hight Arbray, and there in</a>
<a id='line_18411'>the town they found Sir Dinas the Seneschal, that was a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_18412'>But when Sir Sadok had told Sir Dinas of all the treason of King Mark</a>
<a id='line_18413'>he defied such a king, and said he would give up his lands that he held</a>
<a id='line_18414'>of him. And when he said these words all manner knights said as Sir</a>
<a id='line_18415'>Dinas said. Then by his advice and of Sir Sadok’s, he let stuff all the</a>
<a id='line_18416'>towns and castles within the country of Liones, and assembled all the</a>
<a id='line_18417'>people that they might make.</a>
<a id='line_18418'></a>

<a id='line_18421'></a>
<a id='line_18422'>CHAPTER LI. How King Mark let do counterfeit letters from the Pope, and</a>
<a id='line_18423'>how Sir Percivale delivered Sir Tristram out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_18424'></a>
<a id='line_18425'></a>
<a id='line_18426'>Now turn we unto King Mark, that when he was escaped from Sir Sadok he</a>
<a id='line_18427'>rode unto the Castle of Tintagil, and there he made great cry and</a>
<a id='line_18428'>noise, and cried unto harness all that might bear arms. Then they</a>
<a id='line_18429'>sought and found where were dead four cousins of King Mark’s, and the</a>
<a id='line_18430'>traitor of Magouns. Then the king let inter them in a chapel. Then the</a>
<a id='line_18431'>king let cry in all the country that held of him, to go unto arms, for</a>
<a id='line_18432'>he understood to the war he must needs. When King Mark heard and</a>
<a id='line_18433'>understood how Sir Sadok and Sir Dinas were arisen in the country of</a>
<a id='line_18434'>Liones he remembered of wiles and treason. Lo thus he did: he let make</a>
<a id='line_18435'>and counterfeit letters from the Pope, and did make a strange clerk to</a>
<a id='line_18436'>bear them unto King Mark; the which letters specified that King Mark</a>
<a id='line_18437'>should make him ready, upon pain of cursing, with his host to come to</a>
<a id='line_18438'>the Pope, to help to go to Jerusalem, for to make war upon the</a>
<a id='line_18439'>Saracens.</a>
<a id='line_18440'></a>
<a id='line_18441'>When this clerk was come by the mean of the king, anon withal King Mark</a>
<a id='line_18442'>sent these letters unto Sir Tristram and bade him say thus: that an he</a>
<a id='line_18443'>would go war upon the miscreants, he should be had out of prison, and</a>
<a id='line_18444'>to have all his power. When Sir Tristram understood this letter, then</a>
<a id='line_18445'>he said thus to the clerk: Ah, King Mark, ever hast thou been a</a>
<a id='line_18446'>traitor, and ever will be; but, Clerk, said Sir Tristram, say thou thus</a>
<a id='line_18447'>unto King Mark: Since the Apostle Pope hath sent for him, bid him go</a>
<a id='line_18448'>thither himself; for tell him, traitor king as he is, I will not go at</a>
<a id='line_18449'>his commandment, get I out of prison as I may, for I see I am well</a>
<a id='line_18450'>rewarded for my true service. Then the clerk returned unto King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_18451'>and told him of the answer of Sir Tristram. Well, said King Mark, yet</a>
<a id='line_18452'>shall he be beguiled. So he went into his chamber, and counterfeit</a>
<a id='line_18453'>letters; and the letters specified that the Pope desired Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_18454'>to come himself, to make war upon the miscreants. When the clerk was</a>
<a id='line_18455'>come again to Sir Tristram and took him these letters, then Sir</a>
<a id='line_18456'>Tristram beheld these letters, and anon espied they were of King Mark’s</a>
<a id='line_18457'>counterfeiting. Ah, said Sir Tristram, false hast thou been ever, King</a>
<a id='line_18458'>Mark, and so wilt thou end. Then the clerk departed from Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_18459'>and came to King Mark again.</a>
<a id='line_18460'></a>
<a id='line_18461'>By then there were come four wounded knights within the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_18462'>Tintagil, and one of them his neck was nigh broken in twain. Another</a>
<a id='line_18463'>had his arm stricken away, the third was borne through with a spear,</a>
<a id='line_18464'>the fourth had his teeth stricken in twain. And when they came afore</a>
<a id='line_18465'>King Mark they cried and said: King, why fleest thou not, for all this</a>
<a id='line_18466'>country is arisen clearly against thee? Then was King Mark wroth out of</a>
<a id='line_18467'>measure.</a>
<a id='line_18468'></a>
<a id='line_18469'>And in the meanwhile there came into the country Sir Percivale de Galis</a>
<a id='line_18470'>to seek Sir Tristram. And when he heard that Sir Tristram was in</a>
<a id='line_18471'>prison, Sir Percivale made clearly the deliverance of Sir Tristram by</a>
<a id='line_18472'>his knightly means. And when he was so delivered he made great joy of</a>
<a id='line_18473'>Sir Percivale, and so each one of other. Sir Tristram said unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_18474'>Percivale: An ye will abide in these marches I will ride with you. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_18475'>said Percivale, in this country I may not tarry, for I must needs into</a>
<a id='line_18476'>Wales. So Sir Percivale departed from Sir Tristram, and rode straight</a>
<a id='line_18477'>unto King Mark, and told him how he had delivered Sir Tristram; and</a>
<a id='line_18478'>also he told the king that he had done himself great shame for to put</a>
<a id='line_18479'>Sir Tristram in prison, for he is now the knight of most renown in this</a>
<a id='line_18480'>world living. And wit thou well the noblest knights of the world love</a>
<a id='line_18481'>Sir Tristram, and if he will make war upon you ye may not abide it.</a>
<a id='line_18482'>That is truth, said King Mark, but I may not love Sir Tristram because</a>
<a id='line_18483'>he loveth my queen and my wife, La Beale Isoud. Ah, fie for shame, said</a>
<a id='line_18484'>Sir Percivale, say ye never so more. Are ye not uncle unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_18485'>Tristram, and he your nephew? Ye should never think that so noble a</a>
<a id='line_18486'>knight as Sir Tristram is, that he would do himself so great a villainy</a>
<a id='line_18487'>to hold his uncle’s wife; howbeit, said Sir Percivale, he may love your</a>
<a id='line_18488'>queen sinless, because she is called one of the fairest ladies of the</a>
<a id='line_18489'>world.</a>
<a id='line_18490'></a>
<a id='line_18491'>Then Sir Percivale departed from King Mark. So when he was departed</a>
<a id='line_18492'>King Mark bethought him of more treason: notwithstanding King Mark</a>
<a id='line_18493'>granted Sir Percivale never by no manner of means to hurt Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_18494'>So anon King Mark sent unto Sir Dinas the Seneschal that he should put</a>
<a id='line_18495'>down all the people that he had raised, for he sent him an oath that he</a>
<a id='line_18496'>would go himself unto the Pope of Rome to war upon the miscreants; and</a>
<a id='line_18497'>this is a fairer war than thus to arise the people against your king.</a>
<a id='line_18498'>When Sir Dinas understood that King Mark would go upon the miscreants,</a>
<a id='line_18499'>then Sir Dinas in all the haste put down all the people; and when the</a>
<a id='line_18500'>people were departed every man to his home, then King Mark espied where</a>
<a id='line_18501'>was Sir Tristram with La Beale Isoud; and there by treason King Mark</a>
<a id='line_18502'>let take him and put him in prison, contrary to his promise that he</a>
<a id='line_18503'>made unto Sir Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_18504'></a>
<a id='line_18505'>When Queen Isoud understood that Sir Tristram was in prison she made as</a>
<a id='line_18506'>great sorrow as ever made lady or gentlewoman. Then Sir Tristram sent a</a>
<a id='line_18507'>letter unto La Beale Isoud, and prayed her to be his good lady; and if</a>
<a id='line_18508'>it pleased her to make a vessel ready for her and him, he would go with</a>
<a id='line_18509'>her unto the realm of Logris, that is this land. When La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_18510'>understood Sir Tristram’s letters and his intent, she sent him another,</a>
<a id='line_18511'>and bade him be of good comfort, for she would do make the vessel</a>
<a id='line_18512'>ready, and all thing to purpose.</a>
<a id='line_18513'></a>
<a id='line_18514'>Then La Beale Isoud sent unto Sir Dinas, and to Sadok, and prayed them</a>
<a id='line_18515'>in anywise to take King Mark, and put him in prison, unto the time that</a>
<a id='line_18516'>she and Sir Tristram were departed unto the realm of Logris. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_18517'>Dinas the Seneschal understood the treason of King Mark he promised her</a>
<a id='line_18518'>again, and sent her word that King Mark should be put in prison. And as</a>
<a id='line_18519'>they devised it so it was done. And then Sir Tristram was delivered out</a>
<a id='line_18520'>of prison; and anon in all the haste Queen Isoud and Sir Tristram went</a>
<a id='line_18521'>and took their counsel with that they would have with them when they</a>
<a id='line_18522'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_18523'></a>
<a id='line_18524'></a>
<a id='line_18525'></a>
<a id='line_18526'></a>
<a id='line_18527'>CHAPTER LII. How Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud came unto England, and</a>
<a id='line_18528'>how Sir Launcelot brought them to Joyous Gard.</a>
<a id='line_18529'></a>
<a id='line_18530'></a>
<a id='line_18531'>Then La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram took their vessel, and came by</a>
<a id='line_18532'>water into this land. And so they were not in this land four days but</a>
<a id='line_18533'>there came a cry of a jousts and tournament that King Arthur let make.</a>
<a id='line_18534'>When Sir Tristram heard tell of that tournament he disguised himself,</a>
<a id='line_18535'>and La Beale Isoud, and rode unto that tournament. And when he came</a>
<a id='line_18536'>there he saw many knights joust and tourney; and so Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_18537'>dressed him to the range, and to make short conclusion, he overthrew</a>
<a id='line_18538'>fourteen knights of the Round Table. When Sir Launcelot saw these</a>
<a id='line_18539'>knights thus overthrown, Sir Launcelot dressed him to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_18540'>That saw La Beale Isoud how Sir Launcelot was come into the field. Then</a>
<a id='line_18541'>La Beale Isoud sent unto Sir Launcelot a ring, and bade him wit that it</a>
<a id='line_18542'>was Sir Tristram de Liones. When Sir Launcelot under stood that there</a>
<a id='line_18543'>was Sir Tristram he was full glad, and would not joust. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_18544'>Launcelot espied whither Sir Tristram yede, and after him he rode; and</a>
<a id='line_18545'>then either made of other great joy. And so Sir Launcelot brought Sir</a>
<a id='line_18546'>Tristram and La Beale Isoud unto Joyous Gard, that was his own castle,</a>
<a id='line_18547'>that he had won with his own hands. And there Sir Launcelot put them in</a>
<a id='line_18548'>to wield for their own. And wit ye well that castle was garnished and</a>
<a id='line_18549'>furnished for a king and a queen royal there to have sojourned. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_18550'>Launcelot charged all his people to honour them and love them as they</a>
<a id='line_18551'>would do himself.</a>
<a id='line_18552'></a>
<a id='line_18553'>So Sir Launcelot departed unto King Arthur; and then he told Queen</a>
<a id='line_18554'>Guenever how he that jousted so well at the last tournament was Sir</a>
<a id='line_18555'>Tristram. And there he told her how he had with him La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_18556'>maugre King Mark, and so Queen Guenever told all this unto King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_18557'>When King Arthur wist that Sir Tristram was escaped and come from King</a>
<a id='line_18558'>Mark, and had brought La Beale Isoud with him, then was he passing</a>
<a id='line_18559'>glad. So because of Sir Tristram King Arthur let make a cry, that on</a>
<a id='line_18560'>May Day should be a jousts before the castle of Lonazep; and that</a>
<a id='line_18561'>castle was fast by Joyous Gard. And thus Arthur devised, that all the</a>
<a id='line_18562'>knights of this land, and of Cornwall, and of North Wales, should joust</a>
<a id='line_18563'>against all these countries, Ireland, Scotland, and the remnant of</a>
<a id='line_18564'>Wales, and the country of Gore, and Surluse, and of Listinoise, and</a>
<a id='line_18565'>they of Northumberland, and all they that held lands of Arthur on this</a>
<a id='line_18566'>half the sea. When this cry was made many knights were glad and many</a>
<a id='line_18567'>were unglad. Sir, said Launcelot unto Arthur, by this cry that ye have</a>
<a id='line_18568'>made ye will put us that be about you in great jeopardy, for there be</a>
<a id='line_18569'>many knights that have great envy to us; therefore when we shall meet</a>
<a id='line_18570'>at the day of jousts there will be hard shift among us. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_18571'>said Arthur, I care not; there shall we prove who shall be best of his</a>
<a id='line_18572'>hands. So when Sir Launcelot understood wherefore King Arthur made this</a>
<a id='line_18573'>jousting, then he made such purveyance that La Beale Isoud should</a>
<a id='line_18574'>behold the jousts in a secret place that was honest for her estate.</a>
<a id='line_18575'></a>
<a id='line_18576'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram and to La Beale Isoud, how they made</a>
<a id='line_18577'>great joy daily together with all manner of mirths that they could</a>
<a id='line_18578'>devise; and every day Sir Tristram would go ride a-hunting, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_18579'>Tristram was that time called the best chaser of the world, and the</a>
<a id='line_18580'>noblest blower of an horn of all manner of measures; for as books</a>
<a id='line_18581'>report, of Sir Tristram came all the good terms of venery and hunting,</a>
<a id='line_18582'>and all the sizes and measures of blowing of an horn; and of him we had</a>
<a id='line_18583'>first all the terms of hawking, and which were beasts of chase and</a>
<a id='line_18584'>beasts of venery, and which were vermins, and all the blasts that long</a>
<a id='line_18585'>to all manner of games. First to the uncoupling, to the seeking, to the</a>
<a id='line_18586'>rechate, to the flight, to the death, and to strake, and many other</a>
<a id='line_18587'>blasts and terms, that all manner of gentlemen have cause to the</a>
<a id='line_18588'>world’s end to praise Sir Tristram, and to pray for his soul.</a>
<a id='line_18589'></a>
<a id='line_18590'></a>
<a id='line_18591'></a>
<a id='line_18592'></a>
<a id='line_18593'>CHAPTER LIII. How by the counsel of La Beale Isoud Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_18594'>armed, and how he met with Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_18595'></a>
<a id='line_18596'></a>
<a id='line_18597'>So on a day La Beale Isoud said unto Sir Tristram: I marvel me much,</a>
<a id='line_18598'>said she, that ye remember not yourself, how ye be here in a strange</a>
<a id='line_18599'>country, and here be many perilous knights; and well ye wot that King</a>
<a id='line_18600'>Mark is full of treason; and that ye will ride thus to chase and to</a>
<a id='line_18601'>hunt unarmed ye might be destroyed. My fair lady and my love, I cry you</a>
<a id='line_18602'>mercy, I will no more do so. So then Sir Tristram rode daily a-hunting</a>
<a id='line_18603'>armed, and his men bearing his shield and his spear. So on a day a</a>
<a id='line_18604'>little afore the month of May, Sir Tristram chased an hart passing</a>
<a id='line_18605'>eagerly, and so the hart passed by a fair well. And then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_18606'>alighted and put off his helm to drink of that bubbly water. Right so</a>
<a id='line_18607'>he heard and saw the Questing Beast come to the well. When Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_18608'>saw that beast he put on his helm, for he deemed he should hear of Sir</a>
<a id='line_18609'>Palomides, for that beast was his quest. Right so Sir Tristram saw</a>
<a id='line_18610'>where came a knight armed, upon a noble courser, and he saluted him,</a>
<a id='line_18611'>and they spake of many things; and this knight’s name was Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_18612'>Pité. And right so withal there came unto them the noble knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_18613'>Palomides, and either saluted other, and spake fair to other.</a>
<a id='line_18614'></a>
<a id='line_18615'>Fair knights, said Sir Palomides, I can tell you tidings. What is that?</a>
<a id='line_18616'>said those knights. Sirs, wit ye well that King Mark is put in prison</a>
<a id='line_18617'>by his own knights, and all was for love of Sir Tristram; for King Mark</a>
<a id='line_18618'>had put Sir Tristram twice in prison, and once Sir Percivale delivered</a>
<a id='line_18619'>the noble knight Sir Tristram out of prison. And at the last time Queen</a>
<a id='line_18620'>La Beale Isoud delivered him, and went clearly away with him into this</a>
<a id='line_18621'>realm; and all this while King Mark, the false traitor, is in prison.</a>
<a id='line_18622'>Is this truth? said Palomides; then shall we hastily hear of Sir</a>
<a id='line_18623'>Tristram. And as for to say that I love La Beale Isoud paramours, I</a>
<a id='line_18624'>dare make good that I do, and that she hath my service above all other</a>
<a id='line_18625'>ladies, and shall have the term of my life.</a>
<a id='line_18626'></a>
<a id='line_18627'>And right so as they stood talking they saw afore them where came a</a>
<a id='line_18628'>knight all armed, on a great horse, and one of his men bare his shield,</a>
<a id='line_18629'>and the other his spear. And anon as that knight espied them he gat his</a>
<a id='line_18630'>shield and his spear and dressed him to joust. Fair fellows, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18631'>Tristram, yonder is a knight will joust with us, let see which of us</a>
<a id='line_18632'>shall encounter with him, for I see well he is of the court of King</a>
<a id='line_18633'>Arthur. It shall not be long or he be met withal, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_18634'>for I found never no knight in my quest of this glasting beast, but an</a>
<a id='line_18635'>he would joust I never refused him. As well may I, said Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_18636'>Pité, follow that beast as ye. Then shall ye do battle with me, said</a>
<a id='line_18637'>Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_18638'></a>
<a id='line_18639'>So Sir Palomides dressed him unto that other knight, Sir Bleoberis,</a>
<a id='line_18640'>that was a full noble knight, nigh kin unto Sir Launcelot. And so they</a>
<a id='line_18641'>met so hard that Sir Palomides fell to the earth, horse and all. Then</a>
<a id='line_18642'>Sir Bleoberis cried aloud and said thus: Make thee ready thou false</a>
<a id='line_18643'>traitor knight, Breuse Saunce Pité, for wit thou certainly I will have</a>
<a id='line_18644'>ado with thee to the utterance for the noble knights and ladies that</a>
<a id='line_18645'>thou hast falsely betrayed. When this false knight and traitor, Breuse</a>
<a id='line_18646'>Saunce Pité, heard him say so, he took his horse by the bridle and fled</a>
<a id='line_18647'>his way as fast as ever his horse might run, for sore he was of him</a>
<a id='line_18648'>afeard. When Sir Bleoberis saw him flee he followed fast after, through</a>
<a id='line_18649'>thick and through thin. And by fortune as Sir Breuse fled, he saw even</a>
<a id='line_18650'>afore him three knights of the Table Round, of the which the one hight</a>
<a id='line_18651'>Sir Ector de Maris, the other hight Sir Percivale de Galis, the third</a>
<a id='line_18652'>hight Sir Harry le Fise Lake, a good knight and an hardy. And as for</a>
<a id='line_18653'>Sir Percivale, he was called that time of his time one of the best</a>
<a id='line_18654'>knights of the world, and the best assured. When Breuse saw these</a>
<a id='line_18655'>knights he rode straight unto them, and cried unto them and prayed them</a>
<a id='line_18656'>of rescues. What need have ye? said Sir Ector. Ah, fair knights, said</a>
<a id='line_18657'>Sir Breuse, here followeth me the most traitor knight, and most coward,</a>
<a id='line_18658'>and most of villainy; his name is Breuse Saunce Pité, and if he may get</a>
<a id='line_18659'>me he will slay me without mercy and pity. Abide with us, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18660'>Percivale, and we shall warrant you.</a>
<a id='line_18661'></a>
<a id='line_18662'>Then were they ware of Sir Bleoberis that came riding all that he</a>
<a id='line_18663'>might. Then Sir Ector put himself forth to joust afore them all. When</a>
<a id='line_18664'>Sir Bleoberis saw that they were four knights and he but himself, he</a>
<a id='line_18665'>stood in a doubt whether he would turn or hold his way. Then he said to</a>
<a id='line_18666'>himself: I am a knight of the Table Round, and rather than I should</a>
<a id='line_18667'>shame mine oath and my blood I will hold my way whatsoever fall</a>
<a id='line_18668'>thereof. And then Sir Ector dressed his spear, and smote either other</a>
<a id='line_18669'>passing sore, but Sir Ector fell to the earth. That saw Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_18670'>and he dressed his horse toward him all that he might drive, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_18671'>Percivale had such a stroke that horse and man fell to the earth. When</a>
<a id='line_18672'>Sir Harry saw that they were both to the earth then he said to himself:</a>
<a id='line_18673'>Never was Breuse of such prowess. So Sir Harry dressed his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_18674'>they met together so strongly that both the horses and knights fell to</a>
<a id='line_18675'>the earth, but Sir Bleoberis’ horse began to recover again. That saw</a>
<a id='line_18676'>Breuse and he came hurtling, and smote him over and over, and would</a>
<a id='line_18677'>have slain him as he lay on the ground. Then Sir Harry le Fise Lake</a>
<a id='line_18678'>arose lightly, and took the bridle of Sir Breuse’s horse, and said: Fie</a>
<a id='line_18679'>for shame! strike never a knight when he is at the earth, for this</a>
<a id='line_18680'>knight may be called no shameful knight of his deeds, for yet as men</a>
<a id='line_18681'>may see thereas he lieth on the ground he hath done worshipfully, and</a>
<a id='line_18682'>put to the worse passing good knights. Therefore will I not let, said</a>
<a id='line_18683'>Sir Breuse. Thou shalt not choose, said Sir Harry, as at this time.</a>
<a id='line_18684'>Then when Sir Breuse saw that he might not choose nor have his will he</a>
<a id='line_18685'>spake fair. Then Sir Harry let him go. And then anon he made his horse</a>
<a id='line_18686'>to run over Sir Bleoberis, and rashed him to the earth like if he would</a>
<a id='line_18687'>have slain him. When Sir Harry saw him do so villainously he cried:</a>
<a id='line_18688'>Traitor knight, leave off for shame. And as Sir Harry would have taken</a>
<a id='line_18689'>his horse to fight with Sir Breuse, then Sir Breuse ran upon him as he</a>
<a id='line_18690'>was half upon his horse, and smote him down, horse and man, to the</a>
<a id='line_18691'>earth, and had near slain Sir Harry, the good knight. That saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_18692'>Percivale, and then he cried: Traitor knight what dost thou? And when</a>
<a id='line_18693'>Sir Percivale was upon his horse Sir Breuse took his horse and fled all</a>
<a id='line_18694'>that ever he might, and Sir Percivale and Sir Harry followed after him</a>
<a id='line_18695'>fast, but ever the longer they chased the farther were they behind.</a>
<a id='line_18696'></a>
<a id='line_18697'>Then they turned again and came to Sir Ector de Maris and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_18698'>Bleoberis. Ah, fair knights, said Bleoberis, why have ye succoured that</a>
<a id='line_18699'>false knight and traitor? Why said Sir Harry, what knight is he? for</a>
<a id='line_18700'>well I wot it is a false knight, said Sir Harry, and a coward and a</a>
<a id='line_18701'>felonious knight. Sir, said Bleoberis, he is the most coward knight,</a>
<a id='line_18702'>and a devourer of ladies and a destroyer of good knights and especially</a>
<a id='line_18703'>of Arthur’s. What is your name? said Sir Ector. My name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_18704'>Bleoberis de Ganis. Alas, fair cousin, said Ector, forgive it me, for I</a>
<a id='line_18705'>am Sir Ector de Maris. Then Sir Percivale and Sir Harry made great joy</a>
<a id='line_18706'>that they met with Bleoberis, but all they were heavy that Sir Breuse</a>
<a id='line_18707'>was escaped them, whereof they made great dole.</a>
<a id='line_18708'></a>

<a id='line_18712'>CHAPTER LIV. Of Sir Palomides, and how he met with Sir Bleoberis and</a>
<a id='line_18713'>with Sir Ector, and of Sir Pervivale.</a>
<a id='line_18714'></a>
<a id='line_18715'></a>
<a id='line_18716'>Right so as they stood thus there came Sir Palomides, and when he saw</a>
<a id='line_18717'>the shield of Bleoberis lie on the earth, then said Palomides: He that</a>
<a id='line_18718'>oweth that shield let him dress him to me, for he smote me down here</a>
<a id='line_18719'>fast by at a fountain, and therefore I will fight for him on foot. I am</a>
<a id='line_18720'>ready, said Bleoberis, here to answer thee, for wit thou well, sir</a>
<a id='line_18721'>knight, it was I, and my name is Bleoberis de Ganis. Well art thou met,</a>
<a id='line_18722'>said Palomides, and wit thou well my name is Palomides the Saracen; and</a>
<a id='line_18723'>either of them hated other to the death. Sir Palomides, said Ector, wit</a>
<a id='line_18724'>thou well there is neither thou nor none knight that beareth the life</a>
<a id='line_18725'>that slayeth any of our blood but he shall die for it; therefore an</a>
<a id='line_18726'>thou list to fight go seek Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, and there</a>
<a id='line_18727'>shall ye find your match. With them have I met, said Palomides, but I</a>
<a id='line_18728'>had never no worship of them. Was there never no manner of knight, said</a>
<a id='line_18729'>Sir Ector, but they that ever matched with you? Yes, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_18730'>there was the third, a good knight as any of them, and of his age he</a>
<a id='line_18731'>was the best that ever I found; for an he might have lived till he had</a>
<a id='line_18732'>been an hardier man there liveth no knight now such, and his name was</a>
<a id='line_18733'>Sir Lamorak de Galis. And as he had jousted at a tournament there he</a>
<a id='line_18734'>overthrew me and thirty knights more, and there he won the degree. And</a>
<a id='line_18735'>at his departing there met him Sir Gawaine and his brethren, and with</a>
<a id='line_18736'>great pain they slew him feloniously, unto all good knights’ great</a>
<a id='line_18737'>damage. Anon as Sir Percivale heard that his brother was dead, Sir</a>
<a id='line_18738'>Lamorak, he fell over his horse’s mane swooning, and there he made the</a>
<a id='line_18739'>greatest dole that ever made knight. And when Sir Percivale arose he</a>
<a id='line_18740'>said: Alas, my good and noble brother Sir Lamorak, now shall we never</a>
<a id='line_18741'>meet, and I trow in all the wide world a man may not find such a knight</a>
<a id='line_18742'>as he was of his age; and it is too much to suffer the death of our</a>
<a id='line_18743'>father King Pellinore, and now the death of our good brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_18744'>Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_18745'></a>
<a id='line_18746'>Then in the meanwhile there came a varlet from the court of King</a>
<a id='line_18747'>Arthur, and told them of the great tournament that should be at</a>
<a id='line_18748'>Lonazep, and how these lands, Cornwall and Northgalis, should be</a>
<a id='line_18749'>against all them that would come.</a>

<a id='line_18752'></a>
<a id='line_18753'></a>
<a id='line_18754'>CHAPTER LV. How Sir Tristram met with Sir Dinadan, and of their</a>
<a id='line_18755'>devices, and what he said to Sir Gawaine’s brethren.</a>
<a id='line_18756'></a>
<a id='line_18757'></a>
<a id='line_18758'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that as he rode a-hunting he met with</a>
<a id='line_18759'>Sir Dinadan, that was come into that country to seek Sir Tristram. Then</a>
<a id='line_18760'>Sir Dinadan told Sir Tristram his name, but Sir Tristram would not tell</a>
<a id='line_18761'>him his name, wherefore Sir Dinadan was wroth. For such a foolish</a>
<a id='line_18762'>knight as ye are, said Sir Dinadan, I saw but late this day lying by a</a>
<a id='line_18763'>well, and he fared as he slept; and there he lay like a fool grinning,</a>
<a id='line_18764'>and would not speak, and his shield lay by him, and his horse stood by</a>
<a id='line_18765'>him; and well I wot he was a lover. Ah, fair sir, said Sir Tristram are</a>
<a id='line_18766'>ye not a lover? Mary, fie on that craft! said Sir Dinadan. That is evil</a>
<a id='line_18767'>said, said Sir Tristram, for a knight may never be of prowess but if he</a>
<a id='line_18768'>be a lover. It is well said, said Sir Dinadan; now tell me your name,</a>
<a id='line_18769'>sith ye be a lover, or else I shall do battle with you. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_18770'>said Sir Tristram, it is no reason to fight with me but I tell you my</a>
<a id='line_18771'>name; and as for that my name shall ye not wit as at this time. Fie for</a>
<a id='line_18772'>shame, said Dinadan, art thou a knight and durst not tell thy name to</a>
<a id='line_18773'>me? therefore I will fight with thee. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_18774'>will be advised, for I will not do battle but if me list. And if I do</a>
<a id='line_18775'>battle, said Sir Tristram, ye are not able to withstand me. Fie on</a>
<a id='line_18776'>thee, coward, said Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_18777'></a>
<a id='line_18778'>And thus as they hoved still, they saw a knight come riding against</a>
<a id='line_18779'>them. Lo, said Sir Tristram, see where cometh a knight riding will</a>
<a id='line_18780'>joust with you. Anon, as Sir Dinadan beheld him he said: That is the</a>
<a id='line_18781'>same doted knight that I saw lie by the well, neither sleeping nor</a>
<a id='line_18782'>waking. Well, said Sir Tristram, I know that knight well with the</a>
<a id='line_18783'>covered shield of azure, he is the king’s son of Northumberland, his</a>
<a id='line_18784'>name is Epinegris; and he is as great a lover as I know, and he loveth</a>
<a id='line_18785'>the king’s daughter of Wales, a full fair lady. And now I suppose, said</a>
<a id='line_18786'>Sir Tristram, an ye require him he will joust with you, and then shall</a>
<a id='line_18787'>ye prove whether a lover be a better knight, or ye that will not love</a>
<a id='line_18788'>no lady. Well, said Dinadan, now shalt thou see what I shall do.</a>
<a id='line_18789'>Therewithal Sir Dinadan spake on high and said: Sir knight, make thee</a>
<a id='line_18790'>ready to joust with me, for it is the custom of errant knights one to</a>
<a id='line_18791'>joust with other. Sir, said Epinegris, is that the rule of you errant</a>
<a id='line_18792'>knights for to make a knight to joust, will he or nill? As for that,</a>
<a id='line_18793'>said Dinadan, make thee ready, for here is for me. And therewithal they</a>
<a id='line_18794'>spurred their horses and met together so hard that Epinegris smote down</a>
<a id='line_18795'>Sir Dinadan. Then Sir Tristram rode to Sir Dinadan and said: How now,</a>
<a id='line_18796'>meseemeth the lover hath well sped. Fie on thee, coward, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18797'>Dinadan, and if thou be a good knight revenge me. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18798'>Tristram, I will not joust as at this time, but take your horse and let</a>
<a id='line_18799'>us go hence. God defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from thy fellowship, for</a>
<a id='line_18800'>I never sped well since I met with thee: and so they departed. Well,</a>
<a id='line_18801'>said Sir Tristram, peradventure I could tell you tidings of Sir</a>
<a id='line_18802'>Tristram. God defend me, said Dinadan, from thy fellowship, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_18803'>Tristram were mickle the worse an he were in thy company; and then they</a>
<a id='line_18804'>departed. Sir, said Sir Tristram, yet it may happen I shall meet with</a>
<a id='line_18805'>you in other places.</a>
<a id='line_18806'></a>
<a id='line_18807'>So rode Sir Tristram unto Joyous Gard, and there he heard in that town</a>
<a id='line_18808'>great noise and cry. What is this noise? said Sir Tristram. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_18809'>they, here is a knight of this castle that hath been long among us, and</a>
<a id='line_18810'>right now he is slain with two knights, and for none other cause but</a>
<a id='line_18811'>that our knight said that Sir Launcelot were a better knight than Sir</a>
<a id='line_18812'>Gawaine. That was a simple cause, said Sir Tristram, for to slay a good</a>
<a id='line_18813'>knight for to say well by his master. That is little remedy to us, said</a>
<a id='line_18814'>the men of the town. For an Sir Launcelot had been here soon we should</a>
<a id='line_18815'>have been revenged upon the false knights.</a>
<a id='line_18816'></a>
<a id='line_18817'>When Sir Tristram heard them say so he sent for his shield and for his</a>
<a id='line_18818'>spear, and lightly within a while he had overtaken them, and bade them</a>
<a id='line_18819'>turn and amend that they had misdone. What amends wouldst thou have?</a>
<a id='line_18820'>said the one knight. And therewith they took their course, and either</a>
<a id='line_18821'>met other so hard that Sir Tristram smote down that knight over his</a>
<a id='line_18822'>horse’s tail. Then the other knight dressed him to Sir Tristram, and in</a>
<a id='line_18823'>the same wise he served the other knight. And then they gat off their</a>
<a id='line_18824'>horses as well as they might, and dressed their shields and swords to</a>
<a id='line_18825'>do their battle to the utterance. Knights, said Sir Tristram, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_18826'>tell me of whence ye are, and what be your names, for such men ye might</a>
<a id='line_18827'>be ye should hard escape my hands; and ye might be such men of such a</a>
<a id='line_18828'>country that for all your evil deeds ye should pass quit. Wit thou</a>
<a id='line_18829'>well, sir knight, said they, we fear not to tell thee our names, for my</a>
<a id='line_18830'>name is Sir Agravaine, and my name is Gaheris, brethren unto the good</a>
<a id='line_18831'>knight Sir Gawaine, and we be nephews unto King Arthur. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18832'>Tristram, for King Arthur’s sake I shall let you pass as at this time.</a>
<a id='line_18833'>But it is shame, said Sir Tristram, that Sir Gawaine and ye be come of</a>
<a id='line_18834'>so great a blood that ye four brethren are so named as ye be, for ye be</a>
<a id='line_18835'>called the greatest destroyers and murderers of good knights that be</a>
<a id='line_18836'>now in this realm; for it is but as I heard say that Sir Gawaine and ye</a>
<a id='line_18837'>slew among you a better knight than ever ye were, that was the noble</a>
<a id='line_18838'>knight Sir Lamorak de Galis. An it had pleased God, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_18839'>I would I had been by Sir Lamorak at his death. Then shouldst thou have</a>
<a id='line_18840'>gone the same way, said Sir Gaheris. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_18841'>there must have been many more knights than ye are. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_18842'>Tristram departed from them toward Joyous Gard. And when he was</a>
<a id='line_18843'>departed they took their horses, and the one said to the other: We will</a>
<a id='line_18844'>overtake him and be revenged upon him in the despite of Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_18845'></a>

<a id='line_18849'>CHAPTER LVI. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_18850'>and how Sir Dinadan was sent for by La Beale Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_18851'></a>
<a id='line_18852'></a>
<a id='line_18853'>So when they had overtaken Sir Tristram, Sir Agravaine bade him: Turn,</a>
<a id='line_18854'>traitor knight. That is evil said, said Sir Tristram; and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_18855'>pulled out his sword, and smote Sir Agravaine such a buffet upon the</a>
<a id='line_18856'>helm that he tumbled down off his horse in a swoon, and he had a</a>
<a id='line_18857'>grievous wound. And then he turned to Gaheris, and Sir Tristram smote</a>
<a id='line_18858'>his sword and his helm together with such a might that Gaheris fell out</a>
<a id='line_18859'>of his saddle: and so Sir Tristram rode unto Joyous Gard, and there he</a>
<a id='line_18860'>alighted and unarmed him. So Sir Tristram told La Beale Isoud of all</a>
<a id='line_18861'>his adventure, as ye have heard to-fore. And when she heard him tell of</a>
<a id='line_18862'>Sir Dinadan: Sir, said she, is not that he that made the song by King</a>
<a id='line_18863'>Mark? That same is he, said Sir Tristram, for he is the best bourder</a>
<a id='line_18864'>and japer, and a noble knight of his hands, and the best fellow that I</a>
<a id='line_18865'>know, and all good knights love his fellowship. Alas, sir, said she,</a>
<a id='line_18866'>why brought ye not him with you? Have ye no care, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_18867'>for he rideth to seek me in this country; and therefore he will not</a>
<a id='line_18868'>away till he have met with me. And there Sir Tristram told La Beale</a>
<a id='line_18869'>Isoud how Sir Dinadan held against all lovers. Right so there came in a</a>
<a id='line_18870'>varlet and told Sir Tristram how there was come an errant knight into</a>
<a id='line_18871'>the town, with such colours upon his shield. That is Sir Dinadan, said</a>
<a id='line_18872'>Sir Tristram; wit ye what ye shall do, said Sir Tristram: send ye for</a>
<a id='line_18873'>him, my Lady Isoud, and I will not be seen, and ye shall hear the</a>
<a id='line_18874'>merriest knight that ever ye spake withal, and the maddest talker; and</a>
<a id='line_18875'>I pray you heartily that ye make him good cheer.</a>
<a id='line_18876'></a>
<a id='line_18877'>Then anon La Beale Isoud sent into the town, and prayed Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_18878'>that he would come into the castle and repose him there with a lady.</a>
<a id='line_18879'>With a good will, said Sir Dinadan; and so he mounted upon his horse</a>
<a id='line_18880'>and rode into the castle; and there he alighted, and was unarmed, and</a>
<a id='line_18881'>brought into the castle. Anon La Beale Isoud came unto him, and either</a>
<a id='line_18882'>saluted other; then she asked him of whence that he was. Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_18883'>Dinadan, I am of the court of King Arthur, and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_18884'>Round, and my name is Sir Dinadan. What do ye in this country? said La</a>
<a id='line_18885'>Beale Isoud. Madam, said he, I seek Sir Tristram the good knight, for</a>
<a id='line_18886'>it was told me that he was in this country. It may well be, said La</a>
<a id='line_18887'>Beale Isoud, but I am not ware of him. Madam, said Dinadan, I marvel of</a>
<a id='line_18888'>Sir Tristram and mo other lovers, what aileth them to be so mad and so</a>
<a id='line_18889'>sotted upon women. Why, said La Beale Isoud, are ye a knight and be no</a>
<a id='line_18890'>lover? it is shame to you: wherefore ye may not be called a good knight</a>
<a id='line_18891'>[but] if ye make a quarrel for a lady. God defend me, said Dinadan, for</a>
<a id='line_18892'>the joy of love is too short, and the sorrow thereof, and what cometh</a>
<a id='line_18893'>thereof, dureth over long. Ah, said La Beale Isoud, say ye not so, for</a>
<a id='line_18894'>here fast by was the good knight Sir Bleoberis, that fought with three</a>
<a id='line_18895'>knights at once for a damosel’s sake, and he won her afore the King of</a>
<a id='line_18896'>Northumberland. It was so, said Sir Dinadan, for I know him well for a</a>
<a id='line_18897'>good knight and a noble, and come of noble blood; for all be noble</a>
<a id='line_18898'>knights of whom he is come of, that is Sir Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_18899'></a>
<a id='line_18900'>Now I pray you, said La Beale Isoud, tell me will you fight for my love</a>
<a id='line_18901'>with three knights that do me great wrong? and insomuch as ye be a</a>
<a id='line_18902'>knight of King Arthur’s I require you to do battle for me. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_18903'>Dinadan said: I shall say you ye be as fair a lady as ever I saw any,</a>
<a id='line_18904'>and much fairer than is my lady Queen Guenever, but wit ye well at one</a>
<a id='line_18905'>word, I will not fight for you with three knights, Jesu defend me. Then</a>
<a id='line_18906'>Isoud laughed, and had good game at him. So he had all the cheer that</a>
<a id='line_18907'>she might make him, and there he lay all that night. And on the morn</a>
<a id='line_18908'>early Sir Tristram armed him, and La Beale Isoud gave him a good helm;</a>
<a id='line_18909'>and then he promised her that he would meet with Sir Dinadan, and they</a>
<a id='line_18910'>two would ride together into Lonazep, where the tournament should be:</a>
<a id='line_18911'>And there shall I make ready for you where ye shall see the tournament.</a>
<a id='line_18912'>Then departed Sir Tristram with two squires that bare his shield and</a>
<a id='line_18913'>his spears that were great and long.</a>
<a id='line_18914'></a>
<a id='line_18915'></a>
<a id='line_18916'></a>
<a id='line_18917'></a>
<a id='line_18918'>CHAPTER LVII. How Sir Dinadan met with Sir Tristram, and with jousting</a>
<a id='line_18919'>with Sir Palomides, Sir Dinadan knew him.</a>
<a id='line_18920'></a>
<a id='line_18921'></a>
<a id='line_18922'>Then after that Sir Dinadan departed, and rode his way a great pace</a>
<a id='line_18923'>until he had overtaken Sir Tristram. And when Sir Dinadan had overtaken</a>
<a id='line_18924'>him he knew him anon, and he hated the fellowship of him above all</a>
<a id='line_18925'>other knights. Ah, said Sir Dinadan, art thou that coward knight that I</a>
<a id='line_18926'>met with yesterday? keep thee, for thou shalt joust with me maugre thy</a>
<a id='line_18927'>head. Well, said Sir Tristram, and I am loath to joust. And so they let</a>
<a id='line_18928'>their horses run, and Sir Tristram missed of him a-purpose, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_18929'>Dinadan brake a spear upon Sir Tristram, and therewith Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_18930'>dressed him to draw out his sword. Not so, said Sir Tristram, why are</a>
<a id='line_18931'>ye so wroth? I will not fight. Fie on thee, coward, said Dinadan, thou</a>
<a id='line_18932'>shamest all knights. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I care not, for I</a>
<a id='line_18933'>will wait upon you and be under your protection; for because ye are so</a>
<a id='line_18934'>good a knight ye may save me. The devil deliver me of thee, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18935'>Dinadan, for thou art as goodly a man of arms and of thy person as ever</a>
<a id='line_18936'>I saw, and the most coward that ever I saw. What wilt thou do with</a>
<a id='line_18937'>those great spears that thou carriest with thee? I shall give them,</a>
<a id='line_18938'>said Sir Tristram, to some good knight when I come to the tournament;</a>
<a id='line_18939'>and if I see you do best, I shall give them to you.</a>
<a id='line_18940'></a>
<a id='line_18941'>So thus as they rode talking they saw where came an errant knight afore</a>
<a id='line_18942'>them, that dressed him to joust. Lo, said Sir Tristram, yonder is one</a>
<a id='line_18943'>will joust; now dress thee to him. Ah, shame betide thee, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18944'>Dinadan. Nay, not so, said Tristram, for that knight beseemeth a shrew.</a>
<a id='line_18945'>Then shall I, said Sir Dinadan. And so they dressed their shields and</a>
<a id='line_18946'>their spears, and they met together so hard that the other knight smote</a>
<a id='line_18947'>down Sir Dinadan from his horse. Lo, said Sir Tristram, it had been</a>
<a id='line_18948'>better ye had left. Fie on thee, coward, said Sir Dinadan. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_18949'>Dinadan started up and gat his sword in his hand, and proffered to do</a>
<a id='line_18950'>battle on foot. Whether in love or in wrath? said the other knight. Let</a>
<a id='line_18951'>us do battle in love, said Sir Dinadan. What is your name, said that</a>
<a id='line_18952'>knight, I pray you tell me. Wit ye well my name is Sir Dinadan. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_18953'>Dinadan, said that knight, and my name is Gareth, the youngest brother</a>
<a id='line_18954'>unto Sir Gawaine. Then either made of other great cheer, for this</a>
<a id='line_18955'>Gareth was the best knight of all the brethren, and he proved a good</a>
<a id='line_18956'>knight. Then they took their horses, and there they spake of Sir</a>
<a id='line_18957'>Tristram, how such a coward he was; and every word Sir Tristram heard</a>
<a id='line_18958'>and laughed them to scorn.</a>
<a id='line_18959'></a>
<a id='line_18960'>Then were they ware where came a knight afore them well horsed and well</a>
<a id='line_18961'>armed, and he made him ready to joust. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_18962'>look betwixt you who shall joust with yonder knight, for I warn you I</a>
<a id='line_18963'>will not have ado with him. Then shall I, said Sir Gareth. And so they</a>
<a id='line_18964'>encountered together, and there that knight smote down Sir Gareth over</a>
<a id='line_18965'>his horse’s croup. How now, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Dinadan, dress</a>
<a id='line_18966'>thee now and revenge the good knight Gareth. That shall I not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18967'>Dinadan, for he hath stricken down a much bigger knight than I am. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_18968'>said Sir Tristram, now Sir Dinadan, I see and feel well your heart</a>
<a id='line_18969'>faileth you, therefore now shall ye see what I shall do. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_18970'>Tristram hurtled unto that knight, and smote him quite from his horse.</a>
<a id='line_18971'>And when Sir Dinadan saw that, he marvelled greatly; and then he deemed</a>
<a id='line_18972'>that it was Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_18973'></a>
<a id='line_18974'>Then this knight that was on foot pulled out his sword to do battle.</a>
<a id='line_18975'>What is your name? said Sir Tristram. Wit ye well, said that knight, my</a>
<a id='line_18976'>name is Sir Palomides. What knight hate ye most? said Sir Tristram. Sir</a>
<a id='line_18977'>knight, said he, I hate Sir Tristram to the death, for an I may meet</a>
<a id='line_18978'>with him the one of us shall die. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_18979'>wit ye well that I am Sir Tristram de Liones, and now do your worst.</a>
<a id='line_18980'>When Sir Palomides heard him say so he was astonied. And then he said</a>
<a id='line_18981'>thus: I pray you, Sir Tristram, forgive me all mine evil will, and if I</a>
<a id='line_18982'>live I shall do you service above all other knights that be living; and</a>
<a id='line_18983'>whereas I have owed you evil will me sore repenteth. I wot not what</a>
<a id='line_18984'>aileth me, for meseemeth that ye are a good knight, and none other</a>
<a id='line_18985'>knight that named himself a good knight should not hate you; therefore</a>
<a id='line_18986'>I require you, Sir Tristram, take no displeasure at mine unkind words.</a>
<a id='line_18987'>Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, ye say well, and well I wot ye are a</a>
<a id='line_18988'>good knight, for I have seen ye proved; and many great enterprises have</a>
<a id='line_18989'>ye taken upon you, and well achieved them; therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_18990'>Tristram, an ye have any evil will to me, now may ye right it, for I am</a>
<a id='line_18991'>ready at your hand. Not so, my lord Sir Tristram, I will do you</a>
<a id='line_18992'>knightly service in all thing as ye will command. And right so I will</a>
<a id='line_18993'>take you, said Sir Tristram. And so they rode forth on their ways</a>
<a id='line_18994'>talking of many things. O my lord Sir Tristram, said Dinadan, foul have</a>
<a id='line_18995'>ye mocked me, for God knoweth I came into this country for your sake,</a>
<a id='line_18996'>and by the advice of my lord Sir Launcelot; and yet would not Sir</a>
<a id='line_18997'>Launcelot tell me the certainty of you, where I should find you. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_18998'>said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot wist well where I was, for I abode</a>
<a id='line_18999'>within his own castle.</a>
<a id='line_19000'></a>
<a id='line_19001'></a>
<a id='line_19002'></a>
<a id='line_19003'></a>
<a id='line_19004'>CHAPTER LVIII. How they approached the Castle Lonazep, and of other</a>
<a id='line_19005'>devices of the death of Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_19006'></a>
<a id='line_19007'></a>
<a id='line_19008'>Thus they rode until they were ware of the Castle Lonazep. And then</a>
<a id='line_19009'>were they ware of four hundred tents and pavilions, and marvellous</a>
<a id='line_19010'>great ordinance. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, yonder I see the</a>
<a id='line_19011'>greatest ordinance that ever I saw. Sir, said Palomides, meseemeth that</a>
<a id='line_19012'>there was as great an ordinance at the Castle of Maidens upon the rock,</a>
<a id='line_19013'>where ye won the prize, for I saw myself where ye forjousted thirty</a>
<a id='line_19014'>knights. Sir, said Dinadan, and in Surluse, at that tournament that</a>
<a id='line_19015'>Galahalt of the Long Isles made, the which there dured seven days, was</a>
<a id='line_19016'>as great a gathering as is here, for there were many nations. Who was</a>
<a id='line_19017'>the best? said Sir Tristram. Sir, it was Sir Launcelot du Lake and the</a>
<a id='line_19018'>noble knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and Sir Launcelot won the degree. I</a>
<a id='line_19019'>doubt not, said Sir Tristram, but he won the degree, so he had not been</a>
<a id='line_19020'>overmatched with many knights; and of the death of Sir Lamorak, said</a>
<a id='line_19021'>Sir Tristram, it was over great pity, for I dare say he was the</a>
<a id='line_19022'>cleanest mighted man and the best winded of his age that was alive; for</a>
<a id='line_19023'>I knew him that he was the biggest knight that ever I met withal, but</a>
<a id='line_19024'>if it were Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir Tristram, full woe is me for</a>
<a id='line_19025'>his death. And if they were not the cousins of my lord Arthur that slew</a>
<a id='line_19026'>him, they should die for it, and all those that were consenting to his</a>
<a id='line_19027'>death. And for such things, said Sir Tristram, I fear to draw unto the</a>
<a id='line_19028'>court of my lord Arthur; I will that ye wit it, said Sir Tristram unto</a>
<a id='line_19029'>Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_19030'></a>
<a id='line_19031'>Sir, I blame you not, said Gareth, for well I understand the vengeance</a>
<a id='line_19032'>of my brethren Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Mordred. But as for</a>
<a id='line_19033'>me, said Sir Gareth, I meddle not of their matters, therefore there is</a>
<a id='line_19034'>none of them that loveth me. And for I understand they be murderers of</a>
<a id='line_19035'>good knights I left their company; and God would I had been by, said</a>
<a id='line_19036'>Gareth, when the noble knight, Sir Lamorak, was slain.</a>
<a id='line_19037'></a>
<a id='line_19038'>Now as Jesu be my help, said Sir Tristram, it is well said of you, for</a>
<a id='line_19039'>I had liefer than all the gold betwixt this and Rome I had been there.</a>
<a id='line_19040'></a>
<a id='line_19041'>Iwis, said Palomides, and so would I had been there, and yet had I</a>
<a id='line_19042'>never the degree at no jousts nor tournament thereas he was, but he put</a>
<a id='line_19043'>me to the worse, or on foot or on horseback; and that day that he was</a>
<a id='line_19044'>slain he did the most deeds of arms that ever I saw knight do in all my</a>
<a id='line_19045'>life days. And when him was given the degree by my lord Arthur, Sir</a>
<a id='line_19046'>Gawaine and his three brethren, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Sir Mordred,</a>
<a id='line_19047'>set upon Sir Lamorak in a privy place, and there they slew his horse.</a>
<a id='line_19048'>And so they fought with him on foot more than three hours, both before</a>
<a id='line_19049'>him and behind him; and Sir Mordred gave him his death wound behind him</a>
<a id='line_19050'>at his back, and all to-hew him: for one of his squires told me that</a>
<a id='line_19051'>saw it. Fie upon treason, said Sir Tristram, for it killeth my heart to</a>
<a id='line_19052'>hear this tale. So it doth mine, said Gareth; brethren as they be mine</a>
<a id='line_19053'>I shall never love them, nor draw in their fellowship for that deed.</a>
<a id='line_19054'></a>
<a id='line_19055'>Now speak we of other deeds, said Palomides, and let him be, for his</a>
<a id='line_19056'>life ye may not get again. That is the more pity, said Dinadan, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_19057'>Gawaine and his brethren, except you Sir Gareth, hate all the good</a>
<a id='line_19058'>knights of the Round Table for the most part; for well I wot an they</a>
<a id='line_19059'>might privily, they hate my lord Sir Launcelot and all his kin, and</a>
<a id='line_19060'>great privy despite they have at him; and that is my lord Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_19061'>well ware of, and that causeth him to have the good knights of his kin</a>
<a id='line_19062'>about him.</a>
<a id='line_19063'></a>
<a id='line_19064'></a>
<a id='line_19065'></a>
<a id='line_19066'></a>
<a id='line_19067'>CHAPTER LIX. How they came to Humber bank, and how they found a ship</a>
<a id='line_19068'>there, wherein lay the body of King Hermance.</a>
<a id='line_19069'></a>
<a id='line_19070'></a>
<a id='line_19071'>Sir, said Palomides, let us leave of this matter, and let us see how we</a>
<a id='line_19072'>shall do at this tournament. By mine advice, said Palomides, let us</a>
<a id='line_19073'>four hold together against all that will come. Not by my counsel, said</a>
<a id='line_19074'>Sir Tristram, for I see by their pavilions there will be four hundred</a>
<a id='line_19075'>knights, and doubt ye not, said Sir Tristram, but there will be many</a>
<a id='line_19076'>good knights; and be a man never so valiant nor so big, yet he may be</a>
<a id='line_19077'>overmatched. And so have I seen knights done many times; and when they</a>
<a id='line_19078'>weened best to have won worship they lost it, for manhood is not worth</a>
<a id='line_19079'>but if it be medled with wisdom. And as for me, said Sir Tristram, it</a>
<a id='line_19080'>may happen I shall keep mine own head as well as another.</a>
<a id='line_19081'></a>
<a id='line_19082'>So thus they rode until that they came to Humber bank, where they heard</a>
<a id='line_19083'>a cry and a doleful noise. Then were they ware in the wind where came a</a>
<a id='line_19084'>rich vessel hilled over with red silk, and the vessel landed fast by</a>
<a id='line_19085'>them. Therewith Sir Tristram alighted and his knights. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_19086'>Tristram went afore and entered into that vessel. And when he came</a>
<a id='line_19087'>within he saw a fair bed richly covered, and thereupon lay a dead</a>
<a id='line_19088'>seemly knight, all armed save the head, was all be-bled with deadly</a>
<a id='line_19089'>wounds upon him, the which seemed to be a passing good knight. How may</a>
<a id='line_19090'>this be, said Sir Tristram, that this knight is thus slain? Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_19091'>Tristram was ware of a letter in the dead knight’s hand. Master</a>
<a id='line_19092'>mariners, said Sir Tristram, what meaneth that letter? Sir, said they,</a>
<a id='line_19093'>in that letter ye shall hear and know how he was slain, and for what</a>
<a id='line_19094'>cause, and what was his name. But sir, said the mariners, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_19095'>that no man shall take that letter and read it but if he be a good</a>
<a id='line_19096'>knight, and that he will faithfully promise to revenge his death, else</a>
<a id='line_19097'>shall there be no knight see that letter open. Wit ye well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19098'>Tristram, that some of us may revenge his death as well as other, and</a>
<a id='line_19099'>if it be so as ye mariners say his death shall be revenged. And</a>
<a id='line_19100'>therewith Sir Tristram took the letter out of the knight’s hand, and it</a>
<a id='line_19101'>said thus: Hermance, king and lord of the Red City, I send unto all</a>
<a id='line_19102'>knights errant, recommending unto you noble knights of Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_19103'>I beseech them all among them to find one knight that will fight for my</a>
<a id='line_19104'>sake with two brethren that I brought up of nought, and feloniously and</a>
<a id='line_19105'>traitorly they have slain me; wherefore I beseech one good knight to</a>
<a id='line_19106'>revenge my death. And he that revengeth my death I will that he have my</a>
<a id='line_19107'>Red City and all my castles.</a>
<a id='line_19108'></a>
<a id='line_19109'>Sir, said the mariners, wit ye well this king and knight that here</a>
<a id='line_19110'>lieth was a full worshipful man and of full great prowess, and full</a>
<a id='line_19111'>well he loved all manner knights errants. So God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19112'>Tristram, here is a piteous case, and full fain would I take this</a>
<a id='line_19113'>enterprise upon me; but I have made such a promise that needs I must be</a>
<a id='line_19114'>at this great tournament, or else I am shamed. For well I wot for my</a>
<a id='line_19115'>sake in especial my lord Arthur let make this jousts and tournament in</a>
<a id='line_19116'>this country; and well I wot that many worshipful people will be there</a>
<a id='line_19117'>at that tournament for to see me; therefore I fear me to take this</a>
<a id='line_19118'>enterprise upon me that I shall not come again by time to this jousts.</a>
<a id='line_19119'>Sir, said Palomides, I pray you give me this enterprise, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_19120'>see me achieve it worshipfully, other else I shall die in this quarrel.</a>
<a id='line_19121'>Well, said Sir Tristram, and this enterprise I give you, with this,</a>
<a id='line_19122'>that ye be with me at this tournament that shall be as this day seven</a>
<a id='line_19123'>night. Sir, said Palomides, I promise you that I shall be with you by</a>
<a id='line_19124'>that day if I be unslain or unmaimed.</a>
<a id='line_19125'></a>
<a id='line_19126'></a>
<a id='line_19127'></a>
<a id='line_19128'></a>
<a id='line_19129'>CHAPTER LX. How Sir Tristram with his fellowship came and were with an</a>
<a id='line_19130'>host which after fought with Sir Tristram; and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_19131'></a>
<a id='line_19132'></a>
<a id='line_19133'>Then departed Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Sir Dinadan, and left Sir</a>
<a id='line_19134'>Palomides in the vessel; and so Sir Tristram beheld the mariners how</a>
<a id='line_19135'>they sailed overlong Humber. And when Sir Palomides was out of their</a>
<a id='line_19136'>sight they took their horses and beheld about them. And then were they</a>
<a id='line_19137'>ware of a knight that came riding against them unarmed, and nothing</a>
<a id='line_19138'>about him but a sword. And when this knight came nigh them he saluted</a>
<a id='line_19139'>them, and they him again. Fair knights, said that knight, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_19140'>insomuch as ye be knights errant, that ye will come and see my castle,</a>
<a id='line_19141'>and take such as ye find there; I pray you heartily. And so they rode</a>
<a id='line_19142'>with him until his castle, and there they were brought into the hall,</a>
<a id='line_19143'>that was well apparelled; and so they were there unarmed, and set at a</a>
<a id='line_19144'>board; and when this knight saw Sir Tristram, anon he knew him. And</a>
<a id='line_19145'>then this knight waxed pale and wroth at Sir Tristram. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_19146'>Tristram saw his host make such cheer he marvelled and said: Sir, mine</a>
<a id='line_19147'>host, what cheer make you? Wit thou well, said he, I fare the worse for</a>
<a id='line_19148'>thee, for I know thee, Sir Tristram de Liones, thou slewest my brother;</a>
<a id='line_19149'>and therefore I give thee summons I will slay thee an ever I may get</a>
<a id='line_19150'>thee at large. Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I am never advised that</a>
<a id='line_19151'>ever I slew any brother of yours; and if ye say that I did I will make</a>
<a id='line_19152'>amends unto my power. I will none amends, said the knight, but keep</a>
<a id='line_19153'>thee from me.</a>
<a id='line_19154'></a>
<a id='line_19155'>So when he had dined Sir Tristram asked his arms, and departed. And so</a>
<a id='line_19156'>they rode on their ways, and within a while Sir Dinadan saw where came</a>
<a id='line_19157'>a knight well armed and well horsed, without shield. Sir Tristram, said</a>
<a id='line_19158'>Sir Dinadan, take keep to yourself, for I dare undertake yonder cometh</a>
<a id='line_19159'>your host that will have ado with you. Let him come, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_19160'>I shall abide him as well as I may. Anon the knight, when he came nigh</a>
<a id='line_19161'>Sir Tristram, he cried and bade him abide and keep him. So they hurtled</a>
<a id='line_19162'>together, but Sir Tristram smote the other knight so sore that he bare</a>
<a id='line_19163'>him over his horse’s croup. That knight arose lightly and took his</a>
<a id='line_19164'>horse again, and so rode fiercely to Sir Tristram, and smote him twice</a>
<a id='line_19165'>hard upon the helm. Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I pray you leave off</a>
<a id='line_19166'>and smite me no more, for I would be loath to deal with you an I might</a>
<a id='line_19167'>choose, for I have your meat and your drink within my body. For all</a>
<a id='line_19168'>that he would not leave; and then Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet</a>
<a id='line_19169'>upon the helm that he fell up-so-down from his horse, that the blood</a>
<a id='line_19170'>brast out at the ventails of his helm, and so he lay still likely to be</a>
<a id='line_19171'>dead. Then Sir Tristram said: Me repenteth of this buffet that I smote</a>
<a id='line_19172'>so sore, for as I suppose he is dead. And so they left him and rode on</a>
<a id='line_19173'>their ways.</a>
<a id='line_19174'></a>
<a id='line_19175'>So they had not ridden but a while, but they saw riding against them</a>
<a id='line_19176'>two full likely knights, well armed and well horsed, and goodly</a>
<a id='line_19177'>servants about them. The one was Berrant le Apres, and he was called</a>
<a id='line_19178'>the King with the Hundred Knights; and the other was Sir Segwarides,</a>
<a id='line_19179'>which were renowned two noble knights. So as they came either by other</a>
<a id='line_19180'>the king looked upon Sir Dinadan, that at that time he had Sir</a>
<a id='line_19181'>Tristram’s helm upon his shoulder, the which helm the king had seen</a>
<a id='line_19182'>to-fore with the Queen of Northgalis, and that queen the king loved as</a>
<a id='line_19183'>paramour; and that helm the Queen of Northgalis had given to La Beale</a>
<a id='line_19184'>Isoud, and the queen La Beale Isoud gave it to Sir Tristram. Sir</a>
<a id='line_19185'>knight, said Berrant, where had ye that helm? What would ye? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19186'>Dinadan. For I will have ado with thee, said the king, for the love of</a>
<a id='line_19187'>her that owed that helm, and therefore keep you. So they departed and</a>
<a id='line_19188'>came together with all their mights of their horses, and there the King</a>
<a id='line_19189'>with the Hundred Knights smote Sir Dinadan, horse and all, to the</a>
<a id='line_19190'>earth; and then he commanded his servant: Go and take thou his helm</a>
<a id='line_19191'>off, and keep it. So the varlet went to unbuckle his helm. What helm,</a>
<a id='line_19192'>what wilt thou do? said Sir Tristram, leave that helm. To what intent,</a>
<a id='line_19193'>said the king, will ye, sir knight, meddle with that helm? Wit you</a>
<a id='line_19194'>well, said Sir Tristram, that helm shall not depart from me or it be</a>
<a id='line_19195'>dearer bought. Then make you ready, said Sir Berrant unto Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_19196'>So they hurtled together, and there Sir Tristram smote him down over</a>
<a id='line_19197'>his horse’s tail; and then the king arose lightly, and gat his horse</a>
<a id='line_19198'>lightly again. And then he struck fiercely at Sir Tristram many great</a>
<a id='line_19199'>strokes. And then Sir Tristram gave Sir Berrant such a buffet upon the</a>
<a id='line_19200'>helm that he fell down over his horse sore stonied. Lo, said Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_19201'>that helm is unhappy to us twain, for I had a fall for it, and now, sir</a>
<a id='line_19202'>king, have ye another fall.</a>
<a id='line_19203'></a>
<a id='line_19204'>Then Segwarides asked: Who shall joust with me? I pray thee, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19205'>Gareth unto Dinadan, let me have this jousts. Sir, said Dinadan, I pray</a>
<a id='line_19206'>you take it as for me. That is no reason, said Tristram, for this</a>
<a id='line_19207'>jousts should be yours. At a word, said Dinadan, I will not thereof.</a>
<a id='line_19208'>Then Gareth dressed him to Sir Segwarides, and there Sir Segwarides</a>
<a id='line_19209'>smote Gareth and his horse to the earth. Now, said Sir Tristram to</a>
<a id='line_19210'>Dinadan, joust with yonder knight. I will not thereof, said Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_19211'>Then will I, said Sir Tristram. And then Sir Tristram ran to him, and</a>
<a id='line_19212'>gave him a fall; and so they left them on foot, and Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_19213'>unto Joyous Gard, and there Sir Gareth would not of his courtesy have</a>
<a id='line_19214'>gone into this castle, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him to depart.</a>
<a id='line_19215'>And so they alighted and unarmed them, and had great cheer. But when</a>
<a id='line_19216'>Dinadan came afore La Beale Isoud he cursed the time that ever he bare</a>
<a id='line_19217'>Sir Tristram’s helm, and there he told her how Sir Tristram had mocked</a>
<a id='line_19218'>him. Then was there laughing and japing at Sir Dinadan, that they wist</a>
<a id='line_19219'>not what to do with him.</a>
<a id='line_19220'></a>
<a id='line_19221'></a>
<a id='line_19222'></a>
<a id='line_19223'></a>
<a id='line_19224'>CHAPTER LXI. How Palomides went for to fight with two brethren for the</a>
<a id='line_19225'>death of King Hermance.</a>
<a id='line_19226'></a>
<a id='line_19227'></a>
<a id='line_19228'>Now will we leave them merry within Joyous Gard, and speak we of Sir</a>
<a id='line_19229'>Palomides. Then Sir Palomides sailed evenlong Humber to the coasts of</a>
<a id='line_19230'>the sea, where was a fair castle. And at that time it was early in the</a>
<a id='line_19231'>morning, afore day. Then the mariners went unto Sir Palomides that</a>
<a id='line_19232'>slept fast. Sir knight, said the mariners, ye must arise, for here is a</a>
<a id='line_19233'>castle there ye must go into. I assent me, said Sir Palomides; and</a>
<a id='line_19234'>therewithal he arrived. And then he blew his horn that the mariners had</a>
<a id='line_19235'>given him. And when they within the castle heard that horn they put</a>
<a id='line_19236'>forth many knights; and there they stood upon the walls, and said with</a>
<a id='line_19237'>one voice: Welcome be ye to this castle. And then it waxed clear day,</a>
<a id='line_19238'>and Sir Palomides entered into the castle. And within a while he was</a>
<a id='line_19239'>served with many divers meats. Then Sir Palomides heard about him much</a>
<a id='line_19240'>weeping and great dole. What may this mean? said Sir Palomides; I love</a>
<a id='line_19241'>not to hear such a sorrow, and fain I would know what it meaneth. Then</a>
<a id='line_19242'>there came afore him one whose name was Sir Ebel, that said thus: Wit</a>
<a id='line_19243'>ye well, sir knight, this dole and sorrow is here made every day, and</a>
<a id='line_19244'>for this cause: we had a king that hight Hermance, and he was King of</a>
<a id='line_19245'>the Red City, and this king that was lord was a noble knight, large and</a>
<a id='line_19246'>liberal of his expense; and in the world he loved nothing so much as he</a>
<a id='line_19247'>did errant knights of King Arthur’s court, and all jousting, hunting,</a>
<a id='line_19248'>and all manner of knightly games; for so kind a king and knight had</a>
<a id='line_19249'>never the rule of poor people as he was; and because of his goodness</a>
<a id='line_19250'>and gentleness we bemoan him, and ever shall. And all kings and</a>
<a id='line_19251'>estates may beware by our lord, for he was destroyed in his own</a>
<a id='line_19252'>default; for had he cherished them of his blood he had yet lived with</a>
<a id='line_19253'>great riches and rest: but all estates may beware by our king. But</a>
<a id='line_19254'>alas, said Ebel, that we shall give all other warning by his death.</a>
<a id='line_19255'></a>
<a id='line_19256'>Tell me, said Palomides, and in what manner was your lord slain, and by</a>
<a id='line_19257'>whom. Sir, said Sir Ebel, our king brought up of children two men that</a>
<a id='line_19258'>now are perilous knights; and these two knights our king had so in</a>
<a id='line_19259'>charity, that he loved no man nor trusted no man of his blood, nor none</a>
<a id='line_19260'>other that was about him. And by these two knights our king was</a>
<a id='line_19261'>governed, and so they ruled him peaceably and his lands, and never</a>
<a id='line_19262'>would they suffer none of his blood to have no rule with our king. And</a>
<a id='line_19263'>also he was so free and so gentle, and they so false and deceivable,</a>
<a id='line_19264'>that they ruled him peaceably; and that espied the lords of our king’s</a>
<a id='line_19265'>blood, and departed from him unto their own livelihood. Then when these</a>
<a id='line_19266'>two traitors understood that they had driven all the lords of his blood</a>
<a id='line_19267'>from him, they were not pleased with that rule, but then they thought</a>
<a id='line_19268'>to have more, as ever it is an old saw: Give a churl rule and thereby</a>
<a id='line_19269'>he will not be sufficed; for whatsomever he be that is ruled by a</a>
<a id='line_19270'>villain born, and the lord of the soil to be a gentleman born, the same</a>
<a id='line_19271'>villain shall destroy all the gentlemen about him: therefore all</a>
<a id='line_19272'>estates and lords, beware whom ye take about you. And if ye be a knight</a>
<a id='line_19273'>of King Arthur’s court remember this tale, for this is the end and</a>
<a id='line_19274'>conclusion. My lord and king rode unto the forest hereby by the advice</a>
<a id='line_19275'>of these traitors, and there he chased at the red deer, armed at all</a>
<a id='line_19276'>pieces full like a good knight; and so for labour he waxed dry, and</a>
<a id='line_19277'>then he alighted, and drank at a well. And when he was alighted, by the</a>
<a id='line_19278'>assent of these two traitors, that one that hight Helius he suddenly</a>
<a id='line_19279'>smote our king through the body with a spear, and so they left him</a>
<a id='line_19280'>there. And when they were departed, then by fortune I came to the well,</a>
<a id='line_19281'>and found my lord and king wounded to the death. And when I heard his</a>
<a id='line_19282'>complaint, I let bring him to the water side, and in that same ship I</a>
<a id='line_19283'>put him alive; and when my lord King Hermance was in that vessel, he</a>
<a id='line_19284'>required me for the true faith I owed unto him for to write a letter in</a>
<a id='line_19285'>this manner.</a>
<a id='line_19286'></a>

<a id='line_19290'>CHAPTER LXII. The copy of the letter written for to revenge the king’s</a>
<a id='line_19291'>death, and how Sir Palomides fought for to have the battle.</a>
<a id='line_19292'></a>
<a id='line_19293'></a>
<a id='line_19294'>Recommending unto King Arthur and to all his knights errant, beseeching</a>
<a id='line_19295'>them all that insomuch as I, King Hermance, King of the Red City, thus</a>
<a id='line_19296'>am slain by felony and treason, through two knights of mine own, and of</a>
<a id='line_19297'>mine own bringing up and of mine own making, that some worshipful</a>
<a id='line_19298'>knight will revenge my death, insomuch I have been ever to my power</a>
<a id='line_19299'>well willing unto Arthur’s court. And who that will adventure his life</a>
<a id='line_19300'>with these two traitors for my sake in one battle, I, King Hermance,</a>
<a id='line_19301'>King of the Red City, freely give him all my lands and rents that ever</a>
<a id='line_19302'>I wielded in my life. This letter, said Ebel, I wrote by my lord’s</a>
<a id='line_19303'>commandment, and then he received his Creator; and when he was dead, he</a>
<a id='line_19304'>commanded me or ever he were cold to put that letter fast in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_19305'>And then he commanded me to put forth that same vessel down Humber, and</a>
<a id='line_19306'>I should give these mariners in commandment never to stint until that</a>
<a id='line_19307'>they came unto Logris, where all the noble knights shall assemble at</a>
<a id='line_19308'>this time. And there shall some good knight have pity on me to revenge</a>
<a id='line_19309'>my death, for there was never king nor lord falslier nor traitorlier</a>
<a id='line_19310'>slain than I am here to my death. Thus was the complaint of our King</a>
<a id='line_19311'>Hermance. Now, said Sir Ebel, ye know all how our lord was betrayed, we</a>
<a id='line_19312'>require you for God’s sake have pity upon his death, and worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_19313'>revenge his death, and then may ye wield all these lands. For we all</a>
<a id='line_19314'>wit well that an ye may slay these two traitors, the Red City and all</a>
<a id='line_19315'>those that be therein will take you for their lord.</a>
<a id='line_19316'></a>
<a id='line_19317'>Truly, said Sir Palomides, it grieveth my heart for to hear you tell</a>
<a id='line_19318'>this doleful tale; and to say the truth I saw the same letter that ye</a>
<a id='line_19319'>speak of, and one of the best knights on the earth read that letter to</a>
<a id='line_19320'>me, and by his commandment I came hither to revenge your king’s death;</a>
<a id='line_19321'>and therefore have done, and let me wit where I shall find those</a>
<a id='line_19322'>traitors, for I shall never be at ease in my heart till I be in hands</a>
<a id='line_19323'>with them. Sir, said Sir Ebel, then take your ship again, and that ship</a>
<a id='line_19324'>must bring you unto the Delectable Isle, fast by the Red City, and we</a>
<a id='line_19325'>in this castle shall pray for you, and abide your again-coming. For</a>
<a id='line_19326'>this same castle, an ye speed well, must needs be yours; for our King</a>
<a id='line_19327'>Hermance let make this castle for the love of the two traitors, and so</a>
<a id='line_19328'>we kept it with strong hand, and therefore full sore are we threated.</a>
<a id='line_19329'>Wot ye what ye shall do, said Sir Palomides; whatsomever come of me,</a>
<a id='line_19330'>look ye keep well this castle. For an it misfortune me so to be slain</a>
<a id='line_19331'>in this quest I am sure there will come one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_19332'>world for to revenge my death, and that is Sir Tristram de Liones, or</a>
<a id='line_19333'>else Sir Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_19334'></a>
<a id='line_19335'>Then Sir Palomides departed from that castle. And as he came nigh the</a>
<a id='line_19336'>city, there came out of a ship a goodly knight armed against him, with</a>
<a id='line_19337'>his shield on his shoulder, and his hand upon his sword. And anon as he</a>
<a id='line_19338'>came nigh Sir Palomides he said: Sir knight, what seek ye here? leave</a>
<a id='line_19339'>this quest for it is mine, and mine it was or ever it was yours, and</a>
<a id='line_19340'>therefore I will have it. Sir knight, said Palomides, it may well be</a>
<a id='line_19341'>that this quest was yours or it was mine, but when the letter was taken</a>
<a id='line_19342'>out of the dead king’s hand, at that time by likelihood there was no</a>
<a id='line_19343'>knight had undertaken to revenge the death of the king. And so at that</a>
<a id='line_19344'>time I promised to revenge his death, and so I shall or else I am</a>
<a id='line_19345'>ashamed. Ye say well, said the knight, but wit ye well then will I</a>
<a id='line_19346'>fight with you, and who be the better knight of us both, let him take</a>
<a id='line_19347'>the battle upon hand. I assent me, said Sir Palomides. And then they</a>
<a id='line_19348'>dressed their shields, and pulled out their swords, and lashed together</a>
<a id='line_19349'>many sad strokes as men of might; and this fighting was more than an</a>
<a id='line_19350'>hour, but at the last Sir Palomides waxed big and better winded, so</a>
<a id='line_19351'>that then he smote that knight such a stroke that he made him to kneel</a>
<a id='line_19352'>upon his knees. Then that knight spake on high and said: Gentle knight,</a>
<a id='line_19353'>hold thy hand. Sir Palomides was goodly and withdrew his hand. Then</a>
<a id='line_19354'>this knight said: Wit ye well, knight, that thou art better worthy to</a>
<a id='line_19355'>have this battle than I, and require thee of knighthood tell me thy</a>
<a id='line_19356'>name. Sir, my name is Palomides, a knight of King Arthur’s, and of the</a>
<a id='line_19357'>Table Round, that hither I came to revenge the death of this dead king.</a>

<a id='line_19362'>CHAPTER LXIII. Of the preparation of Sir Palomides and the two brethren</a>
<a id='line_19363'>that should fight with him.</a>
<a id='line_19364'></a>
<a id='line_19365'></a>
<a id='line_19366'>Well be ye found, said the knight to Palomides, for of all knights that</a>
<a id='line_19367'>be alive, except three, I had liefest have you. The first is Sir</a>
<a id='line_19368'>Launcelot du Lake, and Sir Tristram de Liones, the third is my nigh</a>
<a id='line_19369'>cousin, Sir Lamorak de Galis. And I am brother unto King Hermance that</a>
<a id='line_19370'>is dead, and my name is Sir Hermind. Ye say well, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_19371'>and ye shall see how I shall speed; and if I be there slain go ye to my</a>
<a id='line_19372'>lord Sir Launcelot, or else to my lord Sir Tristram, and pray them to</a>
<a id='line_19373'>revenge my death, for as for Sir Lamorak him shall ye never see in this</a>
<a id='line_19374'>world. Alas, said Sir Hermind, how may that be? He is slain, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19375'>Palomides, by Sir Gawaine and his brethren. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_19376'>Hermind, there was not one for one that slew him. That is truth, said</a>
<a id='line_19377'>Sir Palomides, for they were four dangerous knights that slew him, as</a>
<a id='line_19378'>Sir Gawaine, Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_19379'>Gareth, the fifth brother was away, the best knight of them all. And so</a>
<a id='line_19380'>Sir Palomides told Hermind all the manner, and how they slew Sir</a>
<a id='line_19381'>Lamorak all only by treason.</a>
<a id='line_19382'></a>
<a id='line_19383'>So Sir Palomides took his ship, and arrived up at the Delectable Isle.</a>
<a id='line_19384'>And in the meanwhile Sir Hermind that was the king’s brother, he</a>
<a id='line_19385'>arrived up at the Red City, and there he told them how there was come a</a>
<a id='line_19386'>knight of King Arthur’s to avenge King Hermance’s death: And his name</a>
<a id='line_19387'>is Sir Palomides, the good knight, that for the most part he followeth</a>
<a id='line_19388'>the beast Glatisant. Then all the city made great joy, for mickle had</a>
<a id='line_19389'>they heard of Sir Palomides, and of his noble prowess. So let they</a>
<a id='line_19390'>ordain a messenger, and sent unto the two brethren, and bade them to</a>
<a id='line_19391'>make them ready, for there was a knight come that would fight with them</a>
<a id='line_19392'>both. So the messenger went unto them where they were at a castle there</a>
<a id='line_19393'>beside; and there he told them how there was a knight come of King</a>
<a id='line_19394'>Arthur’s court to fight with them both at once. He is welcome, said</a>
<a id='line_19395'>they; but tell us, we pray you, if it be Sir Launcelot or any of his</a>
<a id='line_19396'>blood? He is none of that blood, said the messenger. Then we care the</a>
<a id='line_19397'>less, said the two brethren, for with none of the blood of Sir</a>
<a id='line_19398'>Launcelot we keep not to have ado withal. Wit ye well, said the</a>
<a id='line_19399'>messenger, that his name is Sir Palomides, that yet is unchristened, a</a>
<a id='line_19400'>noble knight. Well, said they, an he be now unchristened he shall never</a>
<a id='line_19401'>be christened. So they appointed to be at the city within two days.</a>
<a id='line_19402'></a>
<a id='line_19403'>And when Sir Palomides was come to the city they made passing great joy</a>
<a id='line_19404'>of him, and then they beheld him, and saw that he was well made,</a>
<a id='line_19405'>cleanly and bigly, and unmaimed of his limbs, and neither too young nor</a>
<a id='line_19406'>too old. And so all the people praised him; and though he was not</a>
<a id='line_19407'>christened yet he believed in the best manner, and was full faithful</a>
<a id='line_19408'>and true of his promise, and well conditioned; and because he made his</a>
<a id='line_19409'>avow that he would never be christened unto the time that he had</a>
<a id='line_19410'>achieved the beast Glatisant, the which was a full wonderful beast, and</a>
<a id='line_19411'>a great signification; for Merlin prophesied much of that beast. And</a>
<a id='line_19412'>also Sir Palomides avowed never to take full christendom unto the time</a>
<a id='line_19413'>that he had done seven battles within the lists.</a>
<a id='line_19414'></a>
<a id='line_19415'>So within the third day there came to the city these two brethren, the</a>
<a id='line_19416'>one hight Helius, the other hight Helake, the which were men of great</a>
<a id='line_19417'>prowess; howbeit that they were false and full of treason, and but poor</a>
<a id='line_19418'>men born, yet were they noble knights of their hands. And with them</a>
<a id='line_19419'>they brought forty knights, to that intent that they should be big</a>
<a id='line_19420'>enough for the Red City. Thus came the two brethren with great bobaunce</a>
<a id='line_19421'>and pride, for they had put the Red City in fear and damage. Then they</a>
<a id='line_19422'>were brought to the lists, and Sir Palomides came into the place and</a>
<a id='line_19423'>said thus: Be ye the two brethren, Helius and Helake, that slew your</a>
<a id='line_19424'>king and lord, Sir Hermance, by felony and treason, for whom that I am</a>
<a id='line_19425'>come hither to revenge his death? Wit thou well, said Sir Helius and</a>
<a id='line_19426'>Sir Helake, that we are the same knights that slew King Hermance; and</a>
<a id='line_19427'>wit thou well, Sir Palomides Saracen, that we shall handle thee so or</a>
<a id='line_19428'>thou depart that thou shalt wish that thou wert christened. It may well</a>
<a id='line_19429'>be, said Sir Palomides, for yet I would not die or I were christened;</a>
<a id='line_19430'>and yet so am I not afeard of you both, but I trust to God that I shall</a>
<a id='line_19431'>die a better christian man than any of you both; and doubt ye not, said</a>
<a id='line_19432'>Sir Palomides, either ye or I shall be left dead in this place.</a>
<a id='line_19433'></a>
<a id='line_19434'></a>
<a id='line_19435'></a>
<a id='line_19436'></a>
<a id='line_19437'>CHAPTER LXIV. Of the battle between Sir Palomides and the two brethren,</a>
<a id='line_19438'>and how the two brethren were slain.</a>
<a id='line_19439'></a>
<a id='line_19440'></a>
<a id='line_19441'>Then they departed, and the two brethren came against Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_19442'>and he against them, as fast as their horses might run. And by fortune</a>
<a id='line_19443'>Sir Palomides smote Helake through his shield and through the breast</a>
<a id='line_19444'>more than a fathom. All this while Sir Helius held up his spear, and</a>
<a id='line_19445'>for pride and orgulité he would not smite Sir Palomides with his spear;</a>
<a id='line_19446'>but when he saw his brother lie on the earth, and saw he might not help</a>
<a id='line_19447'>himself, then he said unto Sir Palomides: Help thyself. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_19448'>he came hurtling unto Sir Palomides with his spear, and smote him quite</a>
<a id='line_19449'>from his saddle. Then Sir Helius rode over Sir Palomides twice or</a>
<a id='line_19450'>thrice. And therewith Sir Palomides was ashamed, and gat the horse of</a>
<a id='line_19451'>Sir Helius by the bridle, and therewithal the horse areared, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_19452'>Palomides halp after, and so they fell both to the earth; but anon Sir</a>
<a id='line_19453'>Helius stert up lightly, and there he smote Sir Palomides a great</a>
<a id='line_19454'>stroke upon the helm, that he kneeled upon his own knee. Then they</a>
<a id='line_19455'>lashed together many sad strokes, and traced and traversed now</a>
<a id='line_19456'>backward, now sideling, hurtling together like two boars, and that same</a>
<a id='line_19457'>time they fell both grovelling to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_19458'></a>
<a id='line_19459'>Thus they fought still without any reposing two hours, and never</a>
<a id='line_19460'>breathed; and then Sir Palomides waxed faint and weary, and Sir Helius</a>
<a id='line_19461'>waxed passing strong, and doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_19462'>overthwart and endlong all the field, that they of the city when they</a>
<a id='line_19463'>saw Sir Palomides in this case they wept and cried, and made great</a>
<a id='line_19464'>dole, and the other party made as great joy. Alas, said the men of the</a>
<a id='line_19465'>city, that this noble knight should thus be slain for our king’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_19466'>And as they were thus weeping and crying, Sir Palomides that had</a>
<a id='line_19467'>suffered an hundred strokes, that it was wonder that he stood on his</a>
<a id='line_19468'>feet, at the last Sir Palomides beheld as he might the common people,</a>
<a id='line_19469'>how they wept for him; and then he said to himself: Ah, fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_19470'>Sir Palomides, why hangest thou thy head so low; and therewith he bare</a>
<a id='line_19471'>up his shield, and looked Sir Helius in the visage, and he smote him a</a>
<a id='line_19472'>great stroke upon the helm, and after that another and another. And</a>
<a id='line_19473'>then he smote Sir Helius with such a might that he fell to the earth</a>
<a id='line_19474'>grovelling; and then he raced off his helm from his head, and there he</a>
<a id='line_19475'>smote him such a buffet that he departed his head from the body. And</a>
<a id='line_19476'>then were the people of the city the joyfullest people that might be.</a>
<a id='line_19477'>So they brought him to his lodging with great solemnity, and there all</a>
<a id='line_19478'>the people became his men. And then Sir Palomides prayed them all to</a>
<a id='line_19479'>take keep unto all the lordship of King Hermance: For, fair sirs, wit</a>
<a id='line_19480'>ye well I may not as at this time abide with you, for I must in all</a>
<a id='line_19481'>haste be with my lord King Arthur at the Castle of Lonazep, the which I</a>
<a id='line_19482'>have promised. Then was the people full heavy at his departing, for all</a>
<a id='line_19483'>that city proffered Sir Palomides the third part of their goods so that</a>
<a id='line_19484'>he would abide with them; but in no wise as at that time he would not</a>
<a id='line_19485'>abide.</a>
<a id='line_19486'></a>
<a id='line_19487'>And so Sir Palomides departed, and so he came unto the castle thereas</a>
<a id='line_19488'>Sir Ebel was lieutenant. And when they in the castle wist how Sir</a>
<a id='line_19489'>Palomides had sped, there was a joyful meiny; and so Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_19490'>departed, and came to the castle of Lonazep. And when he wist that Sir</a>
<a id='line_19491'>Tristram was not there he took his way over Humber, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_19492'>Joyous Gard, whereas Sir Tristram was and La Beale Isoud. Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_19493'>had commanded that what knight errant came within the Joyous Gard, as</a>
<a id='line_19494'>in the town, that they should warn Sir Tristram. So there came a man of</a>
<a id='line_19495'>the town, and told Sir Tristram how there was a knight in the town, a</a>
<a id='line_19496'>passing goodly man. What manner of man is he, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_19497'>what sign beareth he? So the man told Sir Tristram all the tokens of</a>
<a id='line_19498'>him. That is Palomides, said Dinadan. It may well be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19499'>Tristram. Go ye to him, said Sir Tristram unto Dinadan. So Dinadan went</a>
<a id='line_19500'>unto Sir Palomides, and there either made other great joy, and so they</a>
<a id='line_19501'>lay together that night. And on the morn early came Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_19502'>Sir Gareth, and took them in their beds, and so they arose and brake</a>
<a id='line_19503'>their fast.</a>
<a id='line_19504'></a>
<a id='line_19505'></a>
<a id='line_19506'></a>
<a id='line_19507'></a>
<a id='line_19508'>CHAPTER LXV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides met Breuse Saunce Pité,</a>
<a id='line_19509'>and how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud went unto Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_19510'></a>
<a id='line_19511'></a>
<a id='line_19512'>And then Sir Tristram desired Sir Palomides to ride into the fields and</a>
<a id='line_19513'>woods. So they were accorded to repose them in the forest. And when</a>
<a id='line_19514'>they had played them a great while they rode unto a fair well; and anon</a>
<a id='line_19515'>they were ware of an armed knight that came riding against them, and</a>
<a id='line_19516'>there either saluted other. Then this armed knight spake to Sir</a>
<a id='line_19517'>Tristram, and asked what were these knights that were lodged in Joyous</a>
<a id='line_19518'>Gard. I wot not what they are, said Sir Tristram. What knights be ye?</a>
<a id='line_19519'>said that knight, for meseemeth ye be no knights errant, because ye</a>
<a id='line_19520'>ride unarmed. Whether we be knights or not we list not to tell thee our</a>
<a id='line_19521'>name. Wilt thou not tell me thy name? said that knight; then keep thee,</a>
<a id='line_19522'>for thou shalt die of my hands. And therewith he got his spear in his</a>
<a id='line_19523'>hands, and would have run Sir Tristram through. That saw Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_19524'>and smote his horse traverse in midst of the side, that man and horse</a>
<a id='line_19525'>fell to the earth. And therewith Sir Palomides alighted and pulled out</a>
<a id='line_19526'>his sword to have slain him. Let be, said Sir Tristram, slay him not,</a>
<a id='line_19527'>the knight is but a fool, it were shame to slay him. But take away his</a>
<a id='line_19528'>spear, said Sir Tristram, and let him take his horse and go where that</a>
<a id='line_19529'>he will.</a>
<a id='line_19530'></a>
<a id='line_19531'>So when this knight arose he groaned sore of the fall, and so he took</a>
<a id='line_19532'>his horse, and when he was up he turned then his horse, and required</a>
<a id='line_19533'>Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides to tell him what knights they were. Now</a>
<a id='line_19534'>wit ye well, said Sir Tristram, that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones,</a>
<a id='line_19535'>and this knight’s name is Sir Palomides. When he wist what they were he</a>
<a id='line_19536'>took his horse with the spurs, because they should not ask him his</a>
<a id='line_19537'>name, and so rode fast away through thick and thin. Then came there by</a>
<a id='line_19538'>them a knight with a bended shield of azure, whose name was Epinogris,</a>
<a id='line_19539'>and he came toward them a great wallop. Whither are ye riding? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19540'>Tristram. My fair lords, said Epinogris, I follow the falsest knight</a>
<a id='line_19541'>that beareth the life; wherefore I require you tell me whether ye saw</a>
<a id='line_19542'>him, for he beareth a shield with a case of red over it. So God me</a>
<a id='line_19543'>help, said Tristram, such a knight departed from us not a quarter of an</a>
<a id='line_19544'>hour agone; we pray you tell us his name. Alas, said Epinogris, why let</a>
<a id='line_19545'>ye him escape from you? and he is so great a foe unto all errant</a>
<a id='line_19546'>knights: his name is Breuse Saunce Pité. Ah, fie for shame, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19547'>Palomides, alas that ever he escaped mine hands, for he is the man in</a>
<a id='line_19548'>the world that I hate most. Then every knight made great sorrow to</a>
<a id='line_19549'>other; and so Epinogris departed and followed the chase after him.</a>
<a id='line_19550'></a>
<a id='line_19551'>Then Sir Tristram and his three fellows rode unto Joyous Gard; and</a>
<a id='line_19552'>there Sir Tristram talked unto Sir Palomides of his battle, how he sped</a>
<a id='line_19553'>at the Red City, and as ye have heard afore so was it ended. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_19554'>said Sir Tristram, I am glad ye have well sped, for ye have done</a>
<a id='line_19555'>worshipfully. Well, said Sir Tristram, we must forward to-morn. And</a>
<a id='line_19556'>then he devised how it should be; and Sir Tristram devised to send his</a>
<a id='line_19557'>two pavilions to set them fast by the well of Lonazep, and therein</a>
<a id='line_19558'>shall be the queen La Beale Isoud. It is well said, said Sir Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_19559'>but when Sir Palomides heard of that his heart was ravished out of</a>
<a id='line_19560'>measure: notwithstanding he said but little. So when they came to</a>
<a id='line_19561'>Joyous Gard Sir Palomides would not have gone into the castle, but as</a>
<a id='line_19562'>Sir Tristram took him by the finger, and led him into the castle. And</a>
<a id='line_19563'>when Sir Palomides saw La Beale Isoud he was ravished so that he might</a>
<a id='line_19564'>unnethe speak. So they went unto meat, but Palomides might not eat, and</a>
<a id='line_19565'>there was all the cheer that might be had. And on the morn they were</a>
<a id='line_19566'>apparelled to ride toward Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_19567'></a>
<a id='line_19568'>So Sir Tristram had three squires, and La Beale Isoud had three</a>
<a id='line_19569'>gentlewomen, and both the queen and they were richly apparelled; and</a>
<a id='line_19570'>other people had they none with them, but varlets to bear their shields</a>
<a id='line_19571'>and their spears. And thus they rode forth. So as they rode they saw</a>
<a id='line_19572'>afore them a rout of knights; it was the knight Galihodin with twenty</a>
<a id='line_19573'>knights with him. Fair fellows, said Galihodin, yonder come four</a>
<a id='line_19574'>knights, and a rich and a well fair lady: I am in will to take that</a>
<a id='line_19575'>lady from them. That is not of the best counsel, said one of</a>
<a id='line_19576'>Galihodin’s men, but send ye to them and wit what they will say; and so</a>
<a id='line_19577'>it was done. There came a squire unto Sir Tristram, and asked them</a>
<a id='line_19578'>whether they would joust or else to lose their lady. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19579'>Tristram, tell your lord I bid him come as many as we be, and win her</a>
<a id='line_19580'>and take her. Sir, said Palomides, an it please you let me have this</a>
<a id='line_19581'>deed, and I shall undertake them all four. I will that ye have it, said</a>
<a id='line_19582'>Sir Tristram, at your pleasure. Now go and tell your lord Galihodin,</a>
<a id='line_19583'>that this same knight will encounter with him and his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_19584'></a>
<a id='line_19585'></a>
<a id='line_19586'></a>
<a id='line_19587'></a>
<a id='line_19588'>CHAPTER LXVI. How Sir Palomides jousted with Sir Galihodin, and after</a>
<a id='line_19589'>with Sir Gawaine, and smote them down.</a>
<a id='line_19590'></a>
<a id='line_19591'></a>
<a id='line_19592'>Then this squire departed and told Galihodin; and then he dressed his</a>
<a id='line_19593'>shield, and put forth a spear, and Sir Palomides another; and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_19594'>Palomides smote Galihodin so hard that he smote both horse and man to</a>
<a id='line_19595'>the earth. And there he had an horrible fall. And then came there</a>
<a id='line_19596'>another knight, and in the same wise he served him; and so he served</a>
<a id='line_19597'>the third and the fourth, that he smote them over their horses’ croups,</a>
<a id='line_19598'>and always Sir Palomides’ spear was whole. Then came six knights more</a>
<a id='line_19599'>of Galihodin’s men, and would have been avenged upon Sir Palomides. Let</a>
<a id='line_19600'>be, said Sir Galihodin, not so hardy, none of you all meddle with this</a>
<a id='line_19601'>knight, for he is a man of great bounté and honour, and if he would ye</a>
<a id='line_19602'>were not able to meddle with him. And right so they held them still.</a>
<a id='line_19603'>And ever Sir Palomides was ready to joust; and when he saw they would</a>
<a id='line_19604'>no more he rode unto Sir Tristram. Right well have ye done, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_19605'>Tristram, and worshipfully have ye done as a good knight should. This</a>
<a id='line_19606'>Galihodin was nigh cousin unto Galahalt, the haut prince; and this</a>
<a id='line_19607'>Galihodin was a king within the country of Surluse.</a>
<a id='line_19608'></a>
<a id='line_19609'>So as Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and La Beale Isoud rode together</a>
<a id='line_19610'>they saw afore them four knights, and every man had his spear in his</a>
<a id='line_19611'>hand: the first was Sir Gawaine, the second Sir Uwaine, the third Sir</a>
<a id='line_19612'>Sagramore le Desirous, and the fourth was Dodinas le Savage. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_19613'>Palomides beheld them, that the four knights were ready to joust, he</a>
<a id='line_19614'>prayed Sir Tristram to give him leave to have ado with them all so long</a>
<a id='line_19615'>as he might hold him on horseback. And if that I be smitten down I pray</a>
<a id='line_19616'>you revenge me. Well, said Sir Tristram, I will as ye will, and ye are</a>
<a id='line_19617'>not so fain to have worship but I would as fain increase your worship.</a>
<a id='line_19618'>And therewithal Sir Gawaine put forth his spear, and Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_19619'>another; and so they came so eagerly together that Sir Palomides smote</a>
<a id='line_19620'>Sir Gawaine to the earth, horse and all; and in the same wise he served</a>
<a id='line_19621'>Uwaine, Sir Dodinas, and Sagramore. All these four knights Sir</a>
<a id='line_19622'>Palomides smote down with divers spears. And then Sir Tristram departed</a>
<a id='line_19623'>toward Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_19624'></a>
<a id='line_19625'>And when they were departed then came thither Galihodin with his ten</a>
<a id='line_19626'>knights unto Sir Gawaine, and there he told him all how he had sped. I</a>
<a id='line_19627'>marvel, said Sir Gawaine, what knights they be, that are so arrayed in</a>
<a id='line_19628'>green. And that knight upon the white horse smote me down, said</a>
<a id='line_19629'>Galihodin, and my three fellows. And so he did to me, said Gawaine; and</a>
<a id='line_19630'>well I wot, said Sir Gawaine, that either he upon the white horse is</a>
<a id='line_19631'>Sir Tristram or else Sir Palomides, and that gay beseen lady is Queen</a>
<a id='line_19632'>Isoud. Thus they talked of one thing and of other.</a>
<a id='line_19633'></a>
<a id='line_19634'>And in the meanwhile Sir Tristram passed on till that he came to the</a>
<a id='line_19635'>well where his two pavilions were set; and there they alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_19636'>there they saw many pavilions and great array. Then Sir Tristram left</a>
<a id='line_19637'>there Sir Palomides and Sir Gareth with La Beale Isoud, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_19638'>Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to Lonazep to hearken tidings; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_19639'>Tristram rode upon Sir Palomides’ white horse. And when he came into</a>
<a id='line_19640'>the castle Sir Dinadan heard a great horn blow, and to the horn drew</a>
<a id='line_19641'>many knights. Then Sir Tristram asked a knight: What meaneth the blast</a>
<a id='line_19642'>of that horn? Sir, said that knight, it is all those that shall hold</a>
<a id='line_19643'>against King Arthur at this tournament. The first is the King of</a>
<a id='line_19644'>Ireland, and the King of Surluse, the King of Listinoise, the King of</a>
<a id='line_19645'>Northumberland, and the King of the best part of Wales, with many other</a>
<a id='line_19646'>countries. And these draw them to a council, to understand what</a>
<a id='line_19647'>governance they shall be of; but the King of Ireland, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_19648'>Marhalt, and father to the good knight Sir Marhaus that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_19649'>slew, had all the speech that Sir Tristram might hear it. He said:</a>
<a id='line_19650'>Lords and fellows, let us look to ourself, for wit ye well King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_19651'>is sure of many good knights, or else he would not with so few knights</a>
<a id='line_19652'>have ado with us; therefore by my counsel let every king have a</a>
<a id='line_19653'>standard and a cognisance by himself, that every knight draw to their</a>
<a id='line_19654'>natural lord, and then may every king and captain help his knights if</a>
<a id='line_19655'>they have need. When Sir Tristram had heard all their counsel he rode</a>
<a id='line_19656'>unto King Arthur for to hear of his counsel.</a>
<a id='line_19657'></a>
<a id='line_19658'></a>
<a id='line_19659'></a>
<a id='line_19660'></a>
<a id='line_19661'>CHAPTER LXVII. How Sir Tristram and his fellowship came into the</a>
<a id='line_19662'>tournament of Lonazep; and of divers jousts and matters.</a>
<a id='line_19663'></a>
<a id='line_19664'></a>
<a id='line_19665'>But Sir Tristram was not so soon come into the place, but Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_19666'>and Sir Galihodin went to King Arthur, and told him: That same green</a>
<a id='line_19667'>knight in the green harness with the white horse smote us two down, and</a>
<a id='line_19668'>six of our fellows this same day. Well, said Arthur. And then he called</a>
<a id='line_19669'>Sir Tristram and asked him what was his name. Sir, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_19670'>ye shall hold me excused as at this time, for ye shall not wit my name.</a>
<a id='line_19671'>And there Sir Tristram returned and rode his way. I have marvel, said</a>
<a id='line_19672'>Arthur, that yonder knight will not tell me his name, but go thou,</a>
<a id='line_19673'>Griflet le Fise de Dieu, and pray him to speak with me betwixt us. Then</a>
<a id='line_19674'>Sir Griflet rode after him and overtook him, and said him that King</a>
<a id='line_19675'>Arthur prayed him for to speak with him secretly apart. Upon this</a>
<a id='line_19676'>covenant, said Sir Tristram, I will speak with him; that I will turn</a>
<a id='line_19677'>again so that ye will ensure me not to desire to hear my name. I shall</a>
<a id='line_19678'>undertake, said Sir Griflet, that he will not greatly desire it of you.</a>
<a id='line_19679'>So they rode together until they came to King Arthur. Fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_19680'>King Arthur, what is the cause ye will not tell me your name? Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_19681'>Sir Tristram, without a cause I will not hide my name. Upon what party</a>
<a id='line_19682'>will ye hold? said King Arthur. Truly, my lord, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_19683'>wot not yet on what party I will be on, until I come to the field, and</a>
<a id='line_19684'>there as my heart giveth me, there will I hold; but to-morrow ye shall</a>
<a id='line_19685'>see and prove on what party I shall come. And therewithal he returned</a>
<a id='line_19686'>and went to his pavilions.</a>
<a id='line_19687'></a>
<a id='line_19688'>And upon the morn they armed them all in green, and came into the</a>
<a id='line_19689'>field; and there young knights began to joust, and did many worshipful</a>
<a id='line_19690'>deeds. Then spake Gareth unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him to give him</a>
<a id='line_19691'>leave to break his spear, for him thought shame to bear his spear whole</a>
<a id='line_19692'>again. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he laughed, and said: I pray</a>
<a id='line_19693'>you do your best. Then Sir Gareth gat a spear and proffered to joust.</a>
<a id='line_19694'>That saw a knight that was nephew unto the King of the Hundred Knights;</a>
<a id='line_19695'>his name was Selises, and a good man of arms. So this knight Selises</a>
<a id='line_19696'>then dressed him unto Sir Gareth, and they two met together so hard</a>
<a id='line_19697'>that either smote other down, his horse and all, to the earth, so they</a>
<a id='line_19698'>were both bruised and hurt; and there they lay till the King with the</a>
<a id='line_19699'>Hundred Knights halp Selises up, and Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_19700'>halp up Gareth again. And so they rode with Sir Gareth unto their</a>
<a id='line_19701'>pavilions, and then they pulled off his helm.</a>
<a id='line_19702'></a>
<a id='line_19703'>And when La Beale Isoud saw Sir Gareth bruised in the face she asked</a>
<a id='line_19704'>him what ailed him. Madam, said Sir Gareth, I had a great buffet, and</a>
<a id='line_19705'>as I suppose I gave another, but none of my fellows, God thank them,</a>
<a id='line_19706'>would not rescue me. Forsooth, said Palomides, it longed not to none of</a>
<a id='line_19707'>us as this day to joust, for there have not this day jousted no proved</a>
<a id='line_19708'>knights, and needly ye would joust. And when the other party saw ye</a>
<a id='line_19709'>proffered yourself to joust they sent one to you, a passing good knight</a>
<a id='line_19710'>of his age, for I know him well, his name is Selises; and worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_19711'>ye met with him, and neither of you are dishonoured, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_19712'>refresh yourself that ye may be ready and whole to joust to-morrow. As</a>
<a id='line_19713'>for that, said Gareth, I shall not fail you an I may bestride mine</a>
<a id='line_19714'>horse.</a>
<a id='line_19715'></a>

<a id='line_19718'></a>
<a id='line_19719'>CHAPTER LXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his fellowship jousted, and of the</a>
<a id='line_19720'>noble feats that they did in that tourneying.</a>
<a id='line_19721'></a>
<a id='line_19722'></a>
<a id='line_19723'>Now upon what party, said Tristram, is it best we be withal as to-morn?</a>
<a id='line_19724'>Sir, said Palomides, ye shall have mine advice to be against King</a>
<a id='line_19725'>Arthur as to-morn, for on his party will be Sir Launcelot and many good</a>
<a id='line_19726'>knights of his blood with him. And the more men of worship that they</a>
<a id='line_19727'>be, the more worship we shall win. That is full knightly spoken, said</a>
<a id='line_19728'>Sir Tristram; and right so as ye counsel me, so will we do. In the name</a>
<a id='line_19729'>of God, said they all. So that night they were lodged with the best.</a>
<a id='line_19730'>And on the morn when it was day they were arrayed all in green</a>
<a id='line_19731'>trappings, shields and spears, and La Beale Isoud in the same colour,</a>
<a id='line_19732'>and her three damosels. And right so these four knights came into the</a>
<a id='line_19733'>field endlong and through. And so they led La Beale Isoud thither as</a>
<a id='line_19734'>she should stand and behold all the jousts in a bay window; but always</a>
<a id='line_19735'>she was wimpled that no man might see her visage. And then these three</a>
<a id='line_19736'>knights rode straight unto the party of the King of Scots.</a>
<a id='line_19737'></a>
<a id='line_19738'>When King Arthur had seen them do all this he asked Sir Launcelot what</a>
<a id='line_19739'>were these knights and that queen. Sir, said Launcelot, I cannot say</a>
<a id='line_19740'>you in certain, but if Sir Tristram be in this country, or Sir</a>
<a id='line_19741'>Palomides, wit ye well it be they m certain, and La Beale Isoud. Then</a>
<a id='line_19742'>Arthur called to him Sir Kay and said: Go lightly and wit how many</a>
<a id='line_19743'>knights there be here lacking of the Table Round, for by the sieges</a>
<a id='line_19744'>thou mayst know. So went Sir Kay and saw by the writings in the sieges</a>
<a id='line_19745'>that there lacked ten knights. And these be their names that be not</a>
<a id='line_19746'>here. Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, Sir Percivale, Sir Gaheris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_19747'>Epinogris, Sir Mordred, Sir Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_19748'>Pelleas the noble knight. Well, said Arthur, some of these I dare</a>
<a id='line_19749'>undertake are here this day against us.</a>
<a id='line_19750'></a>
<a id='line_19751'>Then came therein two brethren, cousins unto Sir Gawaine, the one hight</a>
<a id='line_19752'>Sir Edward, that other hight Sir Sadok, the which were two good</a>
<a id='line_19753'>knights; and they asked of King Arthur that they might have the first</a>
<a id='line_19754'>jousts, for they were of Orkney. I am pleased, said King Arthur. Then</a>
<a id='line_19755'>Sir Edward encountered with the King of Scots, in whose party was Sir</a>
<a id='line_19756'>Tristram and Sir Palomides; and Sir Edward smote the King of Scots</a>
<a id='line_19757'>quite from his horse, and Sir Sadok smote down the King of North Wales,</a>
<a id='line_19758'>and gave him a wonder great fall, that there was a great cry on King</a>
<a id='line_19759'>Arthur’s party, and that made Sir Palomides passing wroth. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_19760'>Palomides dressed his shield and his spear, and with all his might he</a>
<a id='line_19761'>met with Sir Edward of Orkney, that he smote him so hard that his horse</a>
<a id='line_19762'>might not stand on his feet, and so they hurtled to the earth; and then</a>
<a id='line_19763'>with the same spear Sir Palomides smote down Sir Sadok over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_19764'>croup. O Jesu, said Arthur, what knight is that arrayed all in green?</a>
<a id='line_19765'>he jousteth mightily. Wit you well, said Sir Gawaine, he is a good</a>
<a id='line_19766'>knight, and yet shall ye see him joust better or he depart. And yet</a>
<a id='line_19767'>shall ye see, said Sir Gawaine, another bigger knight, in the same</a>
<a id='line_19768'>colour, than he is; for that same knight, said Sir Gawaine, that smote</a>
<a id='line_19769'>down right now my four cousins, he smote me down within these two days,</a>
<a id='line_19770'>and seven fellows more.</a>
<a id='line_19771'></a>
<a id='line_19772'>This meanwhile as they stood thus talking there came into the place Sir</a>
<a id='line_19773'>Tristram upon a black horse, and or ever he stint he smote down with</a>
<a id='line_19774'>one spear four good knights of Orkney that were of the kin of Sir</a>
<a id='line_19775'>Gawaine; and Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan everych of them smote down a</a>
<a id='line_19776'>good knight. Jesu, said Arthur, yonder knight upon the black horse doth</a>
<a id='line_19777'>mightily and marvellously well. Abide you, said Sir Gawaine; that</a>
<a id='line_19778'>knight with the black horse began not yet. Then Sir Tristram made to</a>
<a id='line_19779'>horse again the two kings that Edward and Sadok had unhorsed at the</a>
<a id='line_19780'>beginning. And then Sir Tristram drew his sword and rode into the</a>
<a id='line_19781'>thickest of the press against them of Orkney; and there he smote down</a>
<a id='line_19782'>knights, and rashed off helms, and pulled away their shields, and</a>
<a id='line_19783'>hurtled down many knights: he fared so that Sir Arthur and all knights</a>
<a id='line_19784'>had great marvel when they saw one knight do so great deeds of arms.</a>
<a id='line_19785'>And Sir Palomides failed not upon the other side, but did so</a>
<a id='line_19786'>marvellously well that all men had wonder. For there King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_19787'>likened Sir Tristram that was on the black horse like to a wood lion,</a>
<a id='line_19788'>and likened Sir Palomides upon the white horse unto a wood leopard, and</a>
<a id='line_19789'>Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan unto eager wolves. But the custom was such</a>
<a id='line_19790'>among them that none of the kings would help other, but all the</a>
<a id='line_19791'>fellowship of every standard to help other as they might; but ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_19792'>Tristram did so much deeds of arms that they of Orkney waxed weary of</a>
<a id='line_19793'>him, and so withdrew them unto Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_19794'></a>
<a id='line_19795'></a>
<a id='line_19796'></a>
<a id='line_19797'></a>
<a id='line_19798'>CHAPTER LXIX. How Sir Tristram was unhorsed and smitten down by Sir</a>
<a id='line_19799'>Launcelot, and after that Sir Tristram smote down King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_19800'></a>
<a id='line_19801'></a>
<a id='line_19802'>Then was the cry of heralds and all manner of common people: The Green</a>
<a id='line_19803'>Knight hath done marvellously, and beaten all them of Orkney. And there</a>
<a id='line_19804'>the heralds numbered that Sir Tristram that sat upon the black horse</a>
<a id='line_19805'>had smitten down with spears and swords thirty knights; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_19806'>Palomides had smitten down twenty knights, and the most part of these</a>
<a id='line_19807'>fifty knights were of the house of King Arthur, and proved knights. So</a>
<a id='line_19808'>God me help, said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot, this is a great shame to</a>
<a id='line_19809'>us to see four knights beat so many knights of mine; and therefore make</a>
<a id='line_19810'>you ready, for we will have ado with them. Sir, said Launcelot, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_19811'>well that there are two passing good knights, and great worship were it</a>
<a id='line_19812'>not to us now to have ado with them, for they have this day sore</a>
<a id='line_19813'>travailed. As for that, said Arthur, I will be avenged; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_19814'>take with you Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector, and I will be the fourth,</a>
<a id='line_19815'>said Arthur. Sir, said Launcelot, ye shall find me ready, and my</a>
<a id='line_19816'>brother Sir Ector, and my cousin Sir Bleoberis. And so when they were</a>
<a id='line_19817'>ready and on horseback: Now choose, said Sir Arthur unto Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_19818'>with whom that ye will encounter withal. Sir, said Launcelot, I will</a>
<a id='line_19819'>meet with the green knight upon the black horse, that was Sir Tristram;</a>
<a id='line_19820'>and my cousin Sir Bleoberis shall match the green knight upon the white</a>
<a id='line_19821'>horse, that was Sir Palomides; and my brother Sir Ector shall match</a>
<a id='line_19822'>with the green knight upon the white horse, that was Sir Gareth. Then</a>
<a id='line_19823'>must I, said Sir Arthur, have ado with the green knight upon the</a>
<a id='line_19824'>grisled horse, and that was Sir Dinadan. Now every man take heed to his</a>
<a id='line_19825'>fellow, said Sir Launcelot. And so they trotted on together, and there</a>
<a id='line_19826'>encountered Sir Launcelot against Sir Tristram. So Sir Launcelot smote</a>
<a id='line_19827'>Sir Tristram so sore upon the shield that he bare horse and man to the</a>
<a id='line_19828'>earth; but Sir Launcelot weened that it had been Sir Palomides, and so</a>
<a id='line_19829'>he passed forth. And then Sir Bleoberis encountered with Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_19830'>and he smote him so hard upon the shield that Sir Palomides and his</a>
<a id='line_19831'>white horse rustled to the earth. Then Sir Ector de Maris smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_19832'>Gareth so hard that down he fell off his horse. And the noble King</a>
<a id='line_19833'>Arthur encountered with Sir Dinadan, and he smote him quite from his</a>
<a id='line_19834'>saddle. And then the noise turned awhile how the green knights were</a>
<a id='line_19835'>slain down.</a>
<a id='line_19836'></a>
<a id='line_19837'>When the King of Northgalis saw that Sir Tristram had a fall, then he</a>
<a id='line_19838'>remembered him how great deeds of arms Sir Tristram had done. Then he</a>
<a id='line_19839'>made ready many knights, for the custom and cry was such, that what</a>
<a id='line_19840'>knight were smitten down, and might not be horsed again by his fellows,</a>
<a id='line_19841'>outher by his own strength, that as that day he should be prisoner unto</a>
<a id='line_19842'>the party that had smitten him down. So came in the King of Northgalis,</a>
<a id='line_19843'>and he rode straight unto Sir Tristram; and when he came nigh him he</a>
<a id='line_19844'>alighted down suddenly and betook Sir Tristram his horse, and said</a>
<a id='line_19845'>thus: Noble knight, I know thee not of what country that thou art, but</a>
<a id='line_19846'>for the noble deeds that thou hast done this day take there my horse,</a>
<a id='line_19847'>and let me do as well I may; for, as Jesu me help, thou art better</a>
<a id='line_19848'>worthy to have mine horse than I myself. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_19849'>and if I may I shall quite you: look that ye go not far from us, and as</a>
<a id='line_19850'>I suppose, I shall win you another horse. And therewith Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_19851'>mounted upon his horse, and there he met with King Arthur, and he gave</a>
<a id='line_19852'>him such a buffet upon the helm with his sword that King Arthur had no</a>
<a id='line_19853'>power to keep his saddle. And then Sir Tristram gave the King of</a>
<a id='line_19854'>Northgalis King Arthur’s horse: then was there great press about King</a>
<a id='line_19855'>Arthur for to horse him again; but Sir Palomides would not suffer King</a>
<a id='line_19856'>Arthur to be horsed again, but ever Sir Palomides smote on the right</a>
<a id='line_19857'>hand and on the left hand mightily as a noble knight. And this</a>
<a id='line_19858'>meanwhile Sir Tristram rode through the thickest of the press, and</a>
<a id='line_19859'>smote down knights on the right hand and on the left hand, and raced</a>
<a id='line_19860'>off helms, and so passed forth unto his pavilions, and left Sir</a>
<a id='line_19861'>Palomides on foot; and Sir Tristram changed his horse and disguised</a>
<a id='line_19862'>himself all in red, horse and harness.</a>
<a id='line_19863'></a>
<a id='line_19864'></a>
<a id='line_19865'></a>
<a id='line_19866'></a>
<a id='line_19867'>CHAPTER LXX. How Sir Tristram changed his harness and it was all red,</a>
<a id='line_19868'>and how he demeaned him, and how Sir Palomides slew Launcelot’s horse.</a>
<a id='line_19869'></a>
<a id='line_19870'></a>
<a id='line_19871'>And when the queen La Beale Isoud saw that Sir Tristram was unhorsed,</a>
<a id='line_19872'>and she wist not where he was, then she wept greatly. But Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_19873'>when he was ready, came dashing lightly into the field, and then La</a>
<a id='line_19874'>Beale Isoud espied him. And so he did great deeds of arms; with one</a>
<a id='line_19875'>spear, that was great, Sir Tristram smote down five knights or ever he</a>
<a id='line_19876'>stint. Then Sir Launcelot espied him readily, that it was Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_19877'>and then he repented him that he had smitten him down; and so Sir</a>
<a id='line_19878'>Launcelot went out of the press to repose him and lightly he came</a>
<a id='line_19879'>again. And now when Sir Tristram came into the press, through his great</a>
<a id='line_19880'>force he put Sir Palomides upon his horse, and Sir Gareth, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_19881'>Dinadan, and then they began to do marvellously; but Sir Palomides nor</a>
<a id='line_19882'>none of his two fellows knew not who had holpen them on horseback</a>
<a id='line_19883'>again. But ever Sir Tristram was nigh them and succoured them, and they</a>
<a id='line_19884'>[knew] not him, because he was changed into red armour: and all this</a>
<a id='line_19885'>while Sir Launcelot was away.</a>
<a id='line_19886'></a>
<a id='line_19887'>So when La Beale Isoud knew Sir Tristram again upon his horse-back she</a>
<a id='line_19888'>was passing glad, and then she laughed and made good cheer. And as it</a>
<a id='line_19889'>happened, Sir Palomides looked up toward her where she lay in the</a>
<a id='line_19890'>window, and he espied how she laughed; and therewith he took such a</a>
<a id='line_19891'>rejoicing that he smote down, what with his spear and with his sword,</a>
<a id='line_19892'>all that ever he met; for through the sight of her he was so enamoured</a>
<a id='line_19893'>in her love that he seemed at that time, that an both Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_19894'>Sir Launcelot had been both against him they should have won no worship</a>
<a id='line_19895'>of him; and in his heart, as the book saith, Sir Palomides wished that</a>
<a id='line_19896'>with his worship he might have ado with Sir Tristram before all men,</a>
<a id='line_19897'>because of La Beale Isoud. Then Sir Palomides began to double his</a>
<a id='line_19898'>strength, and he did so marvellously that all men had wonder of him,</a>
<a id='line_19899'>and ever he cast up his eye unto La Beale Isoud. And when he saw her</a>
<a id='line_19900'>make such cheer he fared like a lion, that there might no man withstand</a>
<a id='line_19901'>him; and then Sir Tristram beheld him, how that Sir Palomides bestirred</a>
<a id='line_19902'>him; and then he said unto Sir Dinadan: So God me help, Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_19903'>is a passing good knight and a well enduring, but such deeds saw I him</a>
<a id='line_19904'>never do, nor never heard I tell that ever he did so much in one day.</a>
<a id='line_19905'>It is his day, said Dinadan; and he would say no more unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_19906'>Tristram; but to himself he said: An if ye knew for whose love he doth</a>
<a id='line_19907'>all those deeds of arms, soon would Sir Tristram abate his courage.</a>
<a id='line_19908'>Alas, said Sir Tristram, that Sir Palomides is not christened. So said</a>
<a id='line_19909'>King Arthur, and so said all those that beheld him. Then all people</a>
<a id='line_19910'>gave him the prize, as for the best knight that day, that he passed Sir</a>
<a id='line_19911'>Launcelot outher Sir Tristram. Well, said Dinadan to himself, all this</a>
<a id='line_19912'>worship that Sir Palomides hath here this day he may thank the Queen</a>
<a id='line_19913'>Isoud, for had she been away this day Sir Palomides had not gotten the</a>
<a id='line_19914'>prize this day.</a>
<a id='line_19915'></a>
<a id='line_19916'>Right so came into the field Sir Launcelot du Lake, and saw and heard</a>
<a id='line_19917'>the noise and cry and the great worship that Sir Palomides had. He</a>
<a id='line_19918'>dressed him against Sir Palomides, with a great mighty spear and a</a>
<a id='line_19919'>long, and thought to smite him down. And when Sir Palomides saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_19920'>Launcelot come upon him so fast, he ran upon Sir Launcelot as fast with</a>
<a id='line_19921'>his sword as he might; and as Sir Launcelot should have stricken him he</a>
<a id='line_19922'>smote his spear aside, and smote it a-two with his sword. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_19923'>Palomides rushed unto Sir Launcelot, and thought to have put him to a</a>
<a id='line_19924'>shame; and with his sword he smote his horse’s neck that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_19925'>rode upon, and then Sir Launcelot fell to the earth. Then was the cry</a>
<a id='line_19926'>huge and great: See how Sir Palomides the Saracen hath smitten down Sir</a>
<a id='line_19927'>Launcelot’s horse. Right then were there many knights wroth with Sir</a>
<a id='line_19928'>Palomides because he had done that deed; therefore many knights held</a>
<a id='line_19929'>there against that it was unknightly done in a tournament to kill an</a>
<a id='line_19930'>horse wilfully, but that it had been done in plain battle, life for</a>
<a id='line_19931'>life.</a>
<a id='line_19932'></a>

<a id='line_19935'></a>
<a id='line_19936'>CHAPTER LXXI. How Sir Launcelot said to Sir Palomides, and how the</a>
<a id='line_19937'>prize of that day was given unto Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_19938'></a>
<a id='line_19939'></a>
<a id='line_19940'>When Sir Ector de Maris saw Sir Launcelot his brother have such a</a>
<a id='line_19941'>despite, and so set on foot, then he gat a spear eagerly, and ran</a>
<a id='line_19942'>against Sir Palomides, and he smote him so hard that he bare him quite</a>
<a id='line_19943'>from his horse. That saw Sir Tristram, that was in red harness, and he</a>
<a id='line_19944'>smote down Sir Ector de Maris quite from his horse. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_19945'>dressed his shield upon his shoulder, and with his sword naked in his</a>
<a id='line_19946'>hand, and so came straight upon Sir Palomides fiercely and said: Wit</a>
<a id='line_19947'>thou well thou hast done me this day the greatest despite that ever any</a>
<a id='line_19948'>worshipful knight did to me in tournament or in jousts, and therefore I</a>
<a id='line_19949'>will be avenged upon thee, therefore take keep to yourself. Ah, mercy,</a>
<a id='line_19950'>noble knight, said Palomides, and forgive me mine unkindly deeds, for I</a>
<a id='line_19951'>have no power nor might to withstand you, and I have done so much this</a>
<a id='line_19952'>day that well I wot I did never so much, nor never shall in my</a>
<a id='line_19953'>life-days; and therefore, most noble knight, I require thee spare me as</a>
<a id='line_19954'>at this day, and I promise you I shall ever be your knight while I</a>
<a id='line_19955'>live: an ye put me from my worship now, ye put me from the greatest</a>
<a id='line_19956'>worship that ever I had or ever shall have in my life-days. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_19957'>Sir Launcelot, I see, for to say thee sooth, ye have done marvellously</a>
<a id='line_19958'>well this day; and I understand a part for whose love ye do it, and</a>
<a id='line_19959'>well I wot that love is a great mistress. And if my lady were here as</a>
<a id='line_19960'>she nis not, wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, ye should not bear away</a>
<a id='line_19961'>the worship. But beware your love be not discovered, for an Sir</a>
<a id='line_19962'>Tristram may know it ye will repent it; and sithen my quarrel is not</a>
<a id='line_19963'>here, ye shall have this day the worship as for me; considering the</a>
<a id='line_19964'>great travail and pain that ye have had this day, it were no worship</a>
<a id='line_19965'>for me to put you from it. And therewithal Sir Launcelot suffered Sir</a>
<a id='line_19966'>Palomides to depart.</a>
<a id='line_19967'></a>
<a id='line_19968'>Then Sir Launcelot by great force and might gat his own horse maugre</a>
<a id='line_19969'>twenty knights. So when Sir Launcelot was horsed he did many marvels,</a>
<a id='line_19970'>and so did Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides in like wise. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_19971'>Launcelot smote down with a spear Sir Dinadan, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_19972'>Scotland, and the King of Wales, and the King of Northumberland, and</a>
<a id='line_19973'>the King of Listinoise. So then Sir Launcelot and his fellows smote</a>
<a id='line_19974'>down well a forty knights. Then came the King of Ireland and the King</a>
<a id='line_19975'>of the Straight Marches to rescue Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides. There</a>
<a id='line_19976'>began a great medley, and many knights were smitten down on both</a>
<a id='line_19977'>parties; and always Sir Launcelot spared Sir Tristram, and he spared</a>
<a id='line_19978'>him. And Sir Palomides would not meddle with Sir Launcelot, and so</a>
<a id='line_19979'>there was hurtling here and there. And then King Arthur sent out many</a>
<a id='line_19980'>knights of the Table Round; and Sir Palomides was ever in the foremost</a>
<a id='line_19981'>front, and Sir Tristram did so strongly well that the king and all</a>
<a id='line_19982'>other had marvel. And then the king let blow to lodging; and because</a>
<a id='line_19983'>Sir Palomides began first, and never he went nor rode out of the field</a>
<a id='line_19984'>to repose, but ever he was doing marvellously well either on foot or on</a>
<a id='line_19985'>horseback, and longest during, King Arthur and all the kings gave Sir</a>
<a id='line_19986'>Palomides the honour and the gree as for that day.</a>
<a id='line_19987'></a>
<a id='line_19988'>Then Sir Tristram commanded Sir Dinadan to fetch the queen La Beale</a>
<a id='line_19989'>Isoud, and bring her to his two pavilions that stood by the well. And</a>
<a id='line_19990'>so Dinadan did as he was commanded. But when Sir Palomides understood</a>
<a id='line_19991'>and wist that Sir Tristram was in the red armour, and on a red horse,</a>
<a id='line_19992'>wit ye well that he was glad, and so was Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_19993'>for they all weened that Sir Tristram had been taken prisoner. And then</a>
<a id='line_19994'>every knight drew to his inn. And then King Arthur and every knight</a>
<a id='line_19995'>spake of those knights; but above all men they gave Sir Palomides the</a>
<a id='line_19996'>prize, and all knights that knew Sir Palomides had wonder of his deeds.</a>
<a id='line_19997'>Sir, said Sir Launcelot unto Arthur, as for Sir Palomides an he be the</a>
<a id='line_19998'>green knight I dare say as for this day he is best worthy to have the</a>
<a id='line_19999'>degree, for he reposed him never, nor never changed his weeds, and he</a>
<a id='line_20000'>began first and longest held on. And yet, well I wot, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20001'>Launcelot, that there was a better knight than he, and that shall be</a>
<a id='line_20002'>proved or we depart, upon pain of my life. Thus they talked on either</a>
<a id='line_20003'>party; and so Sir Dinadan railed with Sir Tristram and said: What the</a>
<a id='line_20004'>devil is upon thee this day? for Sir Palomides’ strength feebled never</a>
<a id='line_20005'>this day, but ever he doubled his strength.</a>
<a id='line_20006'></a>

<a id='line_20010'>CHAPTER LXXII. How Sir Dinadan provoked Sir Tristram to do well.</a>
<a id='line_20011'></a>
<a id='line_20012'></a>
<a id='line_20013'>And thou, Sir Tristram, farest all this day as though thou hadst been</a>
<a id='line_20014'>asleep, and therefore I call thee coward. Well, Dinadan, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20015'>Tristram, I was never called coward or now of no earthly knight in my</a>
<a id='line_20016'>life; and wit thou well, sir, I call myself never the more coward</a>
<a id='line_20017'>though Sir Launcelot gave me a fall, for I outcept him of all knights.</a>
<a id='line_20018'>And doubt ye not Sir Dinadan, an Sir Launcelot have a quarrel good, he</a>
<a id='line_20019'>is too over good for any knight that now is living; and yet of his</a>
<a id='line_20020'>sufferance, largess, bounty, and courtesy, I call him knight peerless:</a>
<a id='line_20021'>and so Sir Tristram was in manner wroth with Sir Dinadan. But all this</a>
<a id='line_20022'>language Sir Dinadan said because he would anger Sir Tristram, for to</a>
<a id='line_20023'>cause him to awake his spirits and to be wroth; for well knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_20024'>Dinadan that an Sir Tristram were thoroughly wroth Sir Palomides should</a>
<a id='line_20025'>not get the prize upon the morn. And for this intent Sir Dinadan said</a>
<a id='line_20026'>all this railing and language against Sir Tristram. Truly, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20027'>Palomides, as for Sir Launcelot, of his noble knighthood, courtesy, and</a>
<a id='line_20028'>prowess, and gentleness, I know not his peer; for this day, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20029'>Palomides, I did full uncourteously unto Sir Launcelot, and full</a>
<a id='line_20030'>unknightly, and full knightly and courteously he did to me again; for</a>
<a id='line_20031'>an he had been as ungentle to me as I was to him, this day I had won no</a>
<a id='line_20032'>worship. And therefore, said Palomides, I shall be Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_20033'>knight while my life lasteth. This talking was in the houses of kings.</a>
<a id='line_20034'>But all kings, lords, and knights, said, of clear knighthood, and of</a>
<a id='line_20035'>pure strength, of bounty, of courtesy, Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20036'>bare the prize above all knights that ever were in Arthur’s days. And</a>
<a id='line_20037'>there were never knights in Arthur’s days did half so many deeds as</a>
<a id='line_20038'>they did; as the book saith, no ten knights did not half the deeds that</a>
<a id='line_20039'>they did, and there was never knight in their days that required Sir</a>
<a id='line_20040'>Launcelot or Sir Tristram of any quest, so it were not to their shame,</a>
<a id='line_20041'>but they performed their desire.</a>

<a id='line_20046'>CHAPTER LXXIII. How King Arthur and Sir Lancelot came to see La Beale</a>
<a id='line_20047'>Isoud, and how Palomides smote down King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_20048'></a>
<a id='line_20049'></a>
<a id='line_20050'>So on the morn Sir Launcelot departed, and Sir Tristram was ready, and</a>
<a id='line_20051'>La Beale Isoud with Sir Palomides and Sir Gareth. And so they rode all</a>
<a id='line_20052'>in green full freshly beseen unto the forest. And Sir Tristram left Sir</a>
<a id='line_20053'>Dinadan sleeping in his bed. And so as they rode it happed the king and</a>
<a id='line_20054'>Launcelot stood in a window, and saw Sir Tristram ride and Isoud. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_20055'>said Launcelot, yonder rideth the fairest lady of the world except your</a>
<a id='line_20056'>queen, Dame Guenever. Who is that? said Sir Arthur. Sir, said he, it is</a>
<a id='line_20057'>Queen Isoud that, out-taken my lady your queen, she is makeless. Take</a>
<a id='line_20058'>your horse, said Arthur, and array you at all rights as I will do, and</a>
<a id='line_20059'>I promise you, said the king, I will see her. Then anon they were armed</a>
<a id='line_20060'>and horsed, and either took a spear and rode unto the forest. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_20061'>Launcelot, it is not good that ye go too nigh them, for wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_20062'>there are two as good knights as now are living, and therefore, sir, I</a>
<a id='line_20063'>pray you be not too hasty. For peradventure there will be some knights</a>
<a id='line_20064'>be displeased an we come suddenly upon them. As for that, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_20065'>I will see her, for I take no force whom I grieve. Sir, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_20066'>ye put yourself in great jeopardy. As for that, said the king, we will</a>
<a id='line_20067'>take the adventure. Right so anon the king rode even to her, and</a>
<a id='line_20068'>saluted her, and said: God you save. Sir, said she, ye are welcome.</a>
<a id='line_20069'>Then the king beheld her, and liked her wonderly well.</a>
<a id='line_20070'></a>
<a id='line_20071'>With that came Sir Palomides unto Arthur, and said: Uncourteous knight,</a>
<a id='line_20072'>what seekest thou here? thou art uncourteous to come upon a lady thus</a>
<a id='line_20073'>suddenly, therefore withdraw thee. Sir Arthur took none heed of Sir</a>
<a id='line_20074'>Palomides’ words, but ever he looked still upon Queen Isoud. Then was</a>
<a id='line_20075'>Sir Palomides wroth, and therewith he took a spear, and came hurtling</a>
<a id='line_20076'>upon King Arthur, and smote him down with a spear. When Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_20077'>saw that despite of Sir Palomides, he said to himself: I am loath to</a>
<a id='line_20078'>have ado with yonder knight, and not for his own sake but for Sir</a>
<a id='line_20079'>Tristram. And one thing I am sure of, if I smite down Sir Palomides I</a>
<a id='line_20080'>must have ado with Sir Tristram, and that were overmuch for me to match</a>
<a id='line_20081'>them both, for they are two noble knights; notwithstanding, whether I</a>
<a id='line_20082'>live or I die, needs must I revenge my lord, and so will I, whatsomever</a>
<a id='line_20083'>befall of me. And therewith Sir Launcelot cried to Sir Palomides: Keep</a>
<a id='line_20084'>thee from me. And then Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides rushed together</a>
<a id='line_20085'>with two spears strongly, but Sir Launcelot smote Sir Palomides so hard</a>
<a id='line_20086'>that he went quite out of his saddle, and had a great fall. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_20087'>Tristram saw Sir Palomides have that fall, he said to Sir Launcelot:</a>
<a id='line_20088'>Sir knight, keep thee, for I must joust with thee. As for to joust with</a>
<a id='line_20089'>me, said Sir Launcelot, I will not fail you, for no dread I have of</a>
<a id='line_20090'>you; but I am loath to have ado with you an I might choose, for I will</a>
<a id='line_20091'>that ye wit that I must revenge my special lord that was unhorsed</a>
<a id='line_20092'>unwarly and unknightly. And therefore, though I revenged that fall,</a>
<a id='line_20093'>take ye no displeasure therein, for he is to me such a friend that I</a>
<a id='line_20094'>may not see him shamed.</a>
<a id='line_20095'></a>
<a id='line_20096'>Anon Sir Tristram understood by his person and by his knightly words</a>
<a id='line_20097'>that it was Sir Launcelot du Lake, and verily Sir Tristram deemed that</a>
<a id='line_20098'>it was King Arthur, he that Sir Palomides had smitten down. And then</a>
<a id='line_20099'>Sir Tristram put his spear from him, and put Sir Palomides again on</a>
<a id='line_20100'>horseback, and Sir Launcelot put King Arthur on horseback and so</a>
<a id='line_20101'>departed. So God me help, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, ye did not</a>
<a id='line_20102'>worshipfully when ye smote down that knight so suddenly as ye did. And</a>
<a id='line_20103'>wit ye well ye did yourself great shame, for the knights came hither of</a>
<a id='line_20104'>their gentleness to see a fair lady; and that is every good knight’s</a>
<a id='line_20105'>part, to behold a fair lady; and ye had not ado to play such masteries</a>
<a id='line_20106'>afore my lady. Wit thou well it will turn to anger, for he that ye</a>
<a id='line_20107'>smote down was King Arthur, and that other was the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_20108'>Launcelot. But I shall not forget the words of Sir Launcelot when that</a>
<a id='line_20109'>he called him a man of great worship, thereby I wist that it was King</a>
<a id='line_20110'>Arthur. And as for Sir Launcelot, an there had been five hundred</a>
<a id='line_20111'>knights in the meadow, he would not have refused them, and yet he said</a>
<a id='line_20112'>he would refuse me. By that again I wist that it was Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_20113'>ever he forbeareth me in every place, and showeth me great kindness;</a>
<a id='line_20114'>and of all knights, I out-take none, say what men will say, he beareth</a>
<a id='line_20115'>the flower of all chivalry, say it him whosomever will. An he be well</a>
<a id='line_20116'>angered, and that him list to do his utterance without any favour, I</a>
<a id='line_20117'>know him not alive but Sir Launcelot is over hard for him, be it on</a>
<a id='line_20118'>horseback or on foot. I may never believe, said Palomides, that King</a>
<a id='line_20119'>Arthur will ride so privily as a poor errant knight. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20120'>Tristram, ye know not my lord Arthur, for all knights may learn to be a</a>
<a id='line_20121'>knight of him. And therefore ye may be sorry, said Sir Tristram, of</a>
<a id='line_20122'>your unkindly deeds to so noble a king. And a thing that is done may</a>
<a id='line_20123'>not be undone, said Palomides. Then Sir Tristram sent Queen Isoud unto</a>
<a id='line_20124'>her lodging in the priory, there to behold all the tournament.</a>
<a id='line_20125'></a>

<a id='line_20131'></a>
<a id='line_20132'></a>
<a id='line_20133'>Then there was a cry unto all knights, that when they heard an horn</a>
<a id='line_20134'>blow they should make jousts as they did the first day. And like as the</a>
<a id='line_20135'>brethren Sir Edward and Sir Sadok began the jousts the first day, Sir</a>
<a id='line_20136'>Uwaine the king’s son Urien and Sir Lucanere de Buttelere began the</a>
<a id='line_20137'>jousts the second day. And at the first encounter</a>
<a id='line_20138'></a>
<a id='line_20139'>Sir Uwaine smote down the King’s son of Scots; and Sir Lucanere ran</a>
<a id='line_20140'>against the King of Wales, and they brake their spears all to pieces;</a>
<a id='line_20141'>and they were so fierce both, that they hurtled together that both fell</a>
<a id='line_20142'>to the earth. Then they of Orkney horsed again Sir Lucanere. And then</a>
<a id='line_20143'>came in Sir Tristram de Liones; and then Sir Tristram smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_20144'>Uwaine and Sir Lucanere; and Sir Palomides smote down other two knights</a>
<a id='line_20145'>and Sir Gareth smote down other two knights. Then said Sir Arthur unto</a>
<a id='line_20146'>Sir Launcelot: See yonder three knights do passingly well, and namely</a>
<a id='line_20147'>the first that jousted. Sir, said Launcelot, that knight began not yet</a>
<a id='line_20148'>but ye shall see him this day do marvellously. And then came into the</a>
<a id='line_20149'>place the duke’s son of Orkney, and then they began to do many deeds of</a>
<a id='line_20150'>arms.</a>
<a id='line_20151'></a>
<a id='line_20152'>When Sir Tristram saw them so begin, he said to Palomides: How feel ye</a>
<a id='line_20153'>yourself? may ye do this day as ye did yesterday? Nay, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_20154'>I feel myself so weary, and so sore bruised of the deeds of yesterday,</a>
<a id='line_20155'>that I may not endure as I did yesterday. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20156'>Tristram, for I shall lack you this day. Sir Palomides said: Trust not</a>
<a id='line_20157'>to me, for I may not do as I did. All these words said Palomides for to</a>
<a id='line_20158'>beguile Sir Tristram. Sir, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Gareth, then must</a>
<a id='line_20159'>I trust upon you; wherefore I pray you be not far from me to rescue me.</a>
<a id='line_20160'>An need be, said Sir Gareth, I shall not fail you in all that I may do.</a>
<a id='line_20161'>Then Sir Palomides rode by himself; and then in despite of Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20162'>he put himself in the thickest press among them of Orkney, and there he</a>
<a id='line_20163'>did so marvellously deeds of arms that all men had wonder of him, for</a>
<a id='line_20164'>there might none stand him a stroke.</a>
<a id='line_20165'></a>
<a id='line_20166'>When Sir Tristram saw Sir Palomides do such deeds, he marvelled and</a>
<a id='line_20167'>said to himself: He is weary of my company. So Sir Tristram beheld him</a>
<a id='line_20168'>a great while and did but little else, for the noise and cry was so</a>
<a id='line_20169'>huge and great that Sir Tristram marvelled from whence came the</a>
<a id='line_20170'>strength that Sir Palomides had there in the field. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20171'>Gareth unto Sir Tristram, remember ye not of the words that Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_20172'>said to you yesterday, when he called you a coward; forsooth, sir, he</a>
<a id='line_20173'>said it for none ill, for ye are the man in the world that he most</a>
<a id='line_20174'>loveth, and all that he said was for your worship. And therefore, said</a>
<a id='line_20175'>Sir Gareth to Sir Tristram, let me know this day what ye be; and wonder</a>
<a id='line_20176'>ye not so upon Sir Palomides, for he enforceth himself to win all the</a>
<a id='line_20177'>worship and honour from you. I may well believe it, said Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_20178'>And sithen I understand his evil will and his envy, ye shall see, if</a>
<a id='line_20179'>that I enforce myself, that the noise shall be left that now is upon</a>
<a id='line_20180'>him.</a>
<a id='line_20181'></a>
<a id='line_20182'>Then Sir Tristram rode into the thickest of the press, and then he did</a>
<a id='line_20183'>so marvellously well, and did so great deeds of arms, that all men said</a>
<a id='line_20184'>that Sir Tristram did double so much deeds of arms as Sir Palomides had</a>
<a id='line_20185'>done aforehand. And then the noise went plain from Sir Palomides, and</a>
<a id='line_20186'>all the people cried upon Sir Tristram. O Jesu, said the people, see</a>
<a id='line_20187'>how Sir Tristram smiteth down with his spear so many knights. And see,</a>
<a id='line_20188'>said they all, how many knights he smiteth down with his sword, and of</a>
<a id='line_20189'>how many knights he rashed off their helms and their shields; and so he</a>
<a id='line_20190'>beat them all of Orkney afore him. How now, said Sir Launcelot unto</a>
<a id='line_20191'>King Arthur, I told you that this day there would a knight play his</a>
<a id='line_20192'>pageant. Yonder rideth a knight ye may see he doth knightly, for he</a>
<a id='line_20193'>hath strength and wind. So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_20194'>say sooth, for I saw never a better knight, for he passeth far Sir</a>
<a id='line_20195'>Palomides. Sir, wit ye well, said Launcelot, it must be so of right,</a>
<a id='line_20196'>for it is himself, that noble knight Sir Tristram. I may right well</a>
<a id='line_20197'>believe it, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_20198'></a>
<a id='line_20199'>But when Sir Palomides heard the noise and the cry was turned from him,</a>
<a id='line_20200'>he rode out on a part and beheld Sir Tristram. And when Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20201'>saw Sir Tristram do so marvellously well he wept passingly sore for</a>
<a id='line_20202'>despite, for he wist well he should no worship win that day; for well</a>
<a id='line_20203'>knew Sir Palomides, when Sir Tristram would put forth his strength and</a>
<a id='line_20204'>his manhood, be should get but little worship that day.</a>
<a id='line_20205'></a>
<a id='line_20206'></a>
<a id='line_20207'></a>
<a id='line_20208'></a>
<a id='line_20209'>CHAPTER LXXV. How Sir Tristram departed of the field, and awaked Sir</a>
<a id='line_20210'>Dinadan, and changed his array into black.</a>
<a id='line_20211'></a>
<a id='line_20212'></a>
<a id='line_20213'>Then came King Arthur, and the King of Northgalis, and Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_20214'>Lake; and Sir Bleoberis, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, these</a>
<a id='line_20215'>three knights came into the field with Sir Launcelot. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_20216'>Launcelot with the three knights of his kin did so great deeds of arms</a>
<a id='line_20217'>that all the noise began upon Sir Launcelot. And so they beat the King</a>
<a id='line_20218'>of Wales and the King of Scots far aback, and made them to avoid the</a>
<a id='line_20219'>field; but Sir Tristram and Sir Gareth abode still in the field and</a>
<a id='line_20220'>endured all that ever there came, that all men had wonder that any</a>
<a id='line_20221'>knight might endure so many strokes. But ever Sir Launcelot, and his</a>
<a id='line_20222'>three kinsmen by the commandment of Sir Launcelot, forbare Sir</a>
<a id='line_20223'>Tristram. Then said Sir Arthur: Is that Sir Palomides that endureth so</a>
<a id='line_20224'>well? Nay, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well it is the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_20225'>Tristram, for yonder ye may see Sir Palomides beholdeth and hoveth, and</a>
<a id='line_20226'>doth little or nought. And sir, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20227'>weeneth this day to beat us all out of the field. And as for me, said</a>
<a id='line_20228'>Sir Launcelot, I shall not beat him, beat him whoso will. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_20229'>Launcelot unto Arthur, ye may see how Sir Palomides hoveth yonder, as</a>
<a id='line_20230'>though he were in a dream; wit ye well he is full heavy that Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20231'>doth such deeds of arms. Then is he but a fool, said Arthur, for never</a>
<a id='line_20232'>was Sir Palomides, nor never shall be, of such prowess as Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_20233'>And if he have any envy at Sir Tristram, and cometh in with him upon</a>
<a id='line_20234'>his side he is a false knight.</a>
<a id='line_20235'></a>
<a id='line_20236'>As the king and Sir Launcelot thus spake, Sir Tristram rode privily out</a>
<a id='line_20237'>of the press, that none espied him but La Beale Isoud and Sir</a>
<a id='line_20238'>Palomides, for they two would not let off their eyes upon Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_20239'>And when Sir Tristram came to his pavilions he found Sir Dinadan in his</a>
<a id='line_20240'>bed asleep. Awake, said Tristram, ye ought to be ashamed so to sleep</a>
<a id='line_20241'>when knights have ado in the field. Then Sir Dinadan arose lightly and</a>
<a id='line_20242'>said: What will ye that I shall do? Make you ready, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_20243'>to ride with me into the field. So when Sir Dinadan was armed he looked</a>
<a id='line_20244'>upon Sir Tristram’s helm and on his shield, and when he saw so many</a>
<a id='line_20245'>strokes upon his helm and upon his shield he said: In good time was I</a>
<a id='line_20246'>thus asleep, for had I been with you I must needs for shame there have</a>
<a id='line_20247'>followed you; more for shame than any prowess that is in me; that I see</a>
<a id='line_20248'>well now by those strokes that I should have been truly beaten as I was</a>
<a id='line_20249'>yesterday. Leave your japes, said Sir Tristram, and come off, that [we]</a>
<a id='line_20250'>were in the field again. What, said Sir Dinadan, is your heart up?</a>
<a id='line_20251'>yesterday ye fared as though ye had dreamed. So then Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_20252'>arrayed in black harness. O Jesu, said Dinadan, what aileth you this</a>
<a id='line_20253'>day? meseemeth ye be wilder than ye were yesterday. Then smiled Sir</a>
<a id='line_20254'>Tristram and said to Dinadan: Await well upon me; if ye see me</a>
<a id='line_20255'>overmatched look that ye be ever behind me, and I shall make you ready</a>
<a id='line_20256'>way by God’s grace. So Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan took their horses.</a>
<a id='line_20257'>All this espied Sir Palomides, both their going and their coming, and</a>
<a id='line_20258'>so did La Beale Isoud, for she knew Sir Tristram above all other.</a>
<a id='line_20259'></a>
<a id='line_20260'></a>
<a id='line_20261'></a>
<a id='line_20262'></a>
<a id='line_20263'>CHAPTER LXXVI. How Sir Palomides changed his shield and his armour for</a>
<a id='line_20264'>to hurt Sir Tristram, and how Sir Launcelot did to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_20265'></a>
<a id='line_20266'></a>
<a id='line_20267'>Then when Sir Palomides saw that Sir Tristram was disguised, then he</a>
<a id='line_20268'>thought to do him a shame. So Sir Palomides rode to a knight that was</a>
<a id='line_20269'>sore wounded, that sat under a fair well from the field. Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_20270'>said Sir Palomides, I pray you to lend me your armour and your shield,</a>
<a id='line_20271'>for mine is over-well known in this field, and that hath done me great</a>
<a id='line_20272'>damage; and ye shall have mine armour and my shield that is as sure as</a>
<a id='line_20273'>yours. I will well, said the knight, that ye have mine armour and my</a>
<a id='line_20274'>shield, if they may do you any avail. So Sir Palomides armed him</a>
<a id='line_20275'>hastily in that knight’s armour and his shield that shone as any</a>
<a id='line_20276'>crystal or silver, and so he came riding into the field. And then there</a>
<a id='line_20277'>was neither Sir Tristram nor none of King Arthur’s party that knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_20278'>Palomides. And right so as Sir Palomides was come into the field Sir</a>
<a id='line_20279'>Tristram smote down three knights, even in the sight of Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_20280'>And then Sir Palomides rode against Sir Tristram, and either met other</a>
<a id='line_20281'>with great spears, that they brast to their hands. And then they dashed</a>
<a id='line_20282'>together with swords eagerly. Then Sir Tristram had marvel what knight</a>
<a id='line_20283'>he was that did battle so knightly with him. Then was Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20284'>wroth, for he felt him passing strong, so that he deemed he might not</a>
<a id='line_20285'>have ado with the remnant of the knights, because of the strength of</a>
<a id='line_20286'>Sir Palomides. So they lashed together and gave many sad strokes</a>
<a id='line_20287'>together, and many knights marvelled what knight he might be that so</a>
<a id='line_20288'>encountered with the black knight, Sir Tristram. Full well knew La</a>
<a id='line_20289'>Beale Isoud that there was Sir Palomides that fought with Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_20290'>for she espied all in her window where that she stood, as Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20291'>changed his harness with the wounded knight. And then she began to weep</a>
<a id='line_20292'>so heartily for the despite of Sir Palomides that there she swooned.</a>
<a id='line_20293'></a>
<a id='line_20294'>Then came in Sir Launcelot with the knights of Orkney. And when the</a>
<a id='line_20295'>other party had espied Sir Launcelot, they cried: Return, return, here</a>
<a id='line_20296'>cometh Sir Launcelot du Lake. So there came knights and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_20297'>Launcelot, ye must needs fight with yonder knight in the black harness,</a>
<a id='line_20298'>that was Sir Tristram, for he hath almost overcome that good knight</a>
<a id='line_20299'>that fighteth with him with the silver shield, that was Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_20300'>Then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_20301'>Launcelot said to Palomides: Sir knight, let me have the battle, for ye</a>
<a id='line_20302'>have need to be reposed. Sir Palomides knew Sir Launcelot well, and so</a>
<a id='line_20303'>did Sir Tristram, but because Sir Launcelot was far hardier knight than</a>
<a id='line_20304'>himself therefore he was glad, and suffered Sir Launcelot to fight with</a>
<a id='line_20305'>Sir Tristram. For well wist he that Sir Launcelot knew not Sir</a>
<a id='line_20306'>Tristram, and there he hoped that Sir Launcelot should beat or shame</a>
<a id='line_20307'>Sir Tristram, whereof Sir Palomides was full fain. And so Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_20308'>gave Sir Tristram many sad strokes, but Sir Launcelot knew not Sir</a>
<a id='line_20309'>Tristram, but Sir Tristram knew well Sir Launcelot. And thus they</a>
<a id='line_20310'>fought long together, that La Beale Isoud was well-nigh out of her mind</a>
<a id='line_20311'>for sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_20312'></a>
<a id='line_20313'>Then Sir Dinadan told Sir Gareth how that knight in the black harness</a>
<a id='line_20314'>was Sir Tristram: And this is Launcelot that fighteth with him, that</a>
<a id='line_20315'>must needs have the better of him, for Sir Tristram hath had too much</a>
<a id='line_20316'>travail this day. Then let us smite him down, said Sir Gareth. So it is</a>
<a id='line_20317'>better that we do, said Sir Dinadan, than Sir Tristram be shamed, for</a>
<a id='line_20318'>yonder hoveth the strong knight with the silver shield to fall upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_20319'>Tristram if need be. Then forthwithal Gareth rushed upon Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_20320'>and gave him a great stroke upon his helm so hard that he was astonied.</a>
<a id='line_20321'>And then came Sir Dinadan with a spear, and he smote Sir Launcelot such</a>
<a id='line_20322'>a buffet that horse and all fell to the earth. O Jesu, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20323'>Tristram to Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan, fie for shame, why did ye smite</a>
<a id='line_20324'>down so good a knight as he is, and namely when I had ado with him? now</a>
<a id='line_20325'>ye do yourself great shame, and him no disworship; for I held him</a>
<a id='line_20326'>reasonable hot, though ye had not holpen me.</a>
<a id='line_20327'></a>
<a id='line_20328'>Then came Sir Palomides that was disguised, and smote down Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_20329'>from his horse. Then Sir Launcelot, because Sir Dinadan had smitten him</a>
<a id='line_20330'>aforehand, then Sir Launcelot assailed Sir Dinadan passing sore, and</a>
<a id='line_20331'>Sir Dinadan defended him mightily. But well understood Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20332'>that Sir Dinadan might not endure Sir Launcelot, wherefore Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20333'>was sorry. Then came Sir Palomides fresh upon Sir Tristram. And when</a>
<a id='line_20334'>Sir Tristram saw him come, he thought to deliver him at once, because</a>
<a id='line_20335'>that he would help Sir Dinadan, because he stood in great peril with</a>
<a id='line_20336'>Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Tristram hurtled unto Sir Palomides and gave</a>
<a id='line_20337'>him a great buffet, and then Sir Tristram gat Sir Palomides and pulled</a>
<a id='line_20338'>him down underneath him. And so fell Sir Tristram with him; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_20339'>Tristram leapt up lightly and left Sir Palomides, and went betwixt Sir</a>
<a id='line_20340'>Launcelot and Dinadan, and then they began to do battle together.</a>
<a id='line_20341'></a>
<a id='line_20342'>Right so Sir Dinadan gat Sir Tristram’s horse, and said on high that</a>
<a id='line_20343'>Sir Launcelot might hear it: My lord Sir Tristram, take your horse. And</a>
<a id='line_20344'>when Sir Launcelot heard him name Sir Tristram: O Jesu, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_20345'>what have I done? I am dishonoured. Ah, my lord Sir Tristram, said</a>
<a id='line_20346'>Launcelot, why were ye disguised? ye have put yourself in great peril</a>
<a id='line_20347'>this day; but I pray you noble knight to pardon me, for an I had known</a>
<a id='line_20348'>you we had not done this battle. Sir, said Sir Tristram, this is not</a>
<a id='line_20349'>the first kindness ye showed me. So they were both horsed again.</a>
<a id='line_20350'></a>
<a id='line_20351'>Then all the people on the one side gave Sir Launcelot the honour and</a>
<a id='line_20352'>the degree, and on the other side all the people gave to the noble</a>
<a id='line_20353'>knight Sir Tristram the honour and the degree; but Launcelot said nay</a>
<a id='line_20354'>thereto: For I am not worthy to have this honour, for I will report me</a>
<a id='line_20355'>unto all knights that Sir Tristram hath been longer in the field than</a>
<a id='line_20356'>I, and he hath smitten down many more knights this day than I have</a>
<a id='line_20357'>done. And therefore I will give Sir Tristram my voice and my name, and</a>
<a id='line_20358'>so I pray all my lords and fellows so to do. Then there was the whole</a>
<a id='line_20359'>voice of dukes and earls, barons and knights, that Sir Tristram this</a>
<a id='line_20360'>day is proved the best knight.</a>
<a id='line_20361'></a>
<a id='line_20362'></a>
<a id='line_20363'></a>
<a id='line_20364'></a>
<a id='line_20365'>CHAPTER LXXVII. How Sir Tristram departed with La Beale Isoud, and how</a>
<a id='line_20366'>Palomides followed and excused him.</a>
<a id='line_20367'></a>
<a id='line_20368'></a>
<a id='line_20369'>Then they blew unto lodging, and Queen Isoud was led unto her</a>
<a id='line_20370'>pavilions. But wit you well she was wroth out of measure with Sir</a>
<a id='line_20371'>Palomides, for she saw all his treason from the beginning to the</a>
<a id='line_20372'>ending. And all this while neither Sir Tristram, neither Sir Gareth nor</a>
<a id='line_20373'>Dinadan, knew not of the treason of Sir Palomides; but afterward ye</a>
<a id='line_20374'>shall hear that there befell the greatest debate betwixt Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20375'>and Sir Palomides that might be.</a>
<a id='line_20376'></a>
<a id='line_20377'>So when the tournament was done, Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_20378'>rode with La Beale Isoud to these pavilions. And ever Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20379'>rode with them in their company disguised as he was. But when Sir</a>
<a id='line_20380'>Tristram had espied him that he was the same knight with the shield of</a>
<a id='line_20381'>silver that held him so hot that day: Sir knight, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_20382'>wit ye well here is none that hath need of your fellowship, and</a>
<a id='line_20383'>therefore I pray you depart from us. Sir Palomides answered again as</a>
<a id='line_20384'>though he had not known Sir Tristram: Wit you well, sir knight, from</a>
<a id='line_20385'>this fellowship will I never depart, for one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_20386'>world commanded me to be in this company, and till he discharge me of</a>
<a id='line_20387'>my service I will not be discharged. By that Sir Tristram knew that it</a>
<a id='line_20388'>was Sir Palomides. Ah, Sir Palomides, said the noble knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_20389'>Tristram, are ye such a knight? Ye have been named wrong, for ye have</a>
<a id='line_20390'>long been called a gentle knight, and as this day ye have showed me</a>
<a id='line_20391'>great ungentleness, for ye had almost brought me unto my death. But, as</a>
<a id='line_20392'>for you, I suppose I should have done well enough, but Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_20393'>with you was overmuch; for I know no knight living but Sir Launcelot is</a>
<a id='line_20394'>over good for him, an he will do his uttermost. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20395'>Palomides, are ye my lord Sir Tristram? Yea, sir, and that ye know well</a>
<a id='line_20396'>enough. By my knighthood, said Palomides, until now I knew you not; I</a>
<a id='line_20397'>weened that ye had been the King of Ireland, for well I wot ye bare his</a>
<a id='line_20398'>arms. His arms I bare, said Sir Tristram, and that will I stand by, for</a>
<a id='line_20399'>I won them once in a field of a full noble knight, his name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_20400'>Marhaus; and with great pain I won that knight, for there was none</a>
<a id='line_20401'>other recover, but Sir Marhaus died through false leeches; and yet was</a>
<a id='line_20402'>he never yolden to me. Sir, said Palomides, I weened ye had been turned</a>
<a id='line_20403'>upon Sir Launcelot’s party, and that caused me to turn. Ye say well,</a>
<a id='line_20404'>said Sir Tristram, and so I take you, and I forgive you.</a>
<a id='line_20405'></a>
<a id='line_20406'>So then they rode into their pavilions; and when they were alighted</a>
<a id='line_20407'>they unarmed them and washed their faces and hands, and so yode unto</a>
<a id='line_20408'>meat, and were set at their table. But when Isoud saw Sir Palomides she</a>
<a id='line_20409'>changed then her colours, and for wrath she might not speak. Anon Sir</a>
<a id='line_20410'>Tristram espied her countenance and said: Madam, for what cause make ye</a>
<a id='line_20411'>us such cheer? we have been sore travailed this day. Mine own lord,</a>
<a id='line_20412'>said La Beale Isoud, for God’s sake be ye not displeased with me, for I</a>
<a id='line_20413'>may none otherwise do; for I saw this day how ye were betrayed and nigh</a>
<a id='line_20414'>brought to your death. Truly, sir, I saw every deal, how and in what</a>
<a id='line_20415'>wise, and therefore, sir, how should I suffer in your presence such a</a>
<a id='line_20416'>felon and traitor as Sir Palomides; for I saw him with mine eyes, how</a>
<a id='line_20417'>he beheld you when ye went out of the field. For ever he hoved still</a>
<a id='line_20418'>upon his horse till he saw you come in againward. And then forthwithal</a>
<a id='line_20419'>I saw him ride to the hurt knight, and changed harness with him, and</a>
<a id='line_20420'>then straight I saw him how he rode into the field. And anon as he had</a>
<a id='line_20421'>found you he encountered with you, and thus wilfully Sir Palomides did</a>
<a id='line_20422'>battle with you; and as for him, sir, I was not greatly afraid, but I</a>
<a id='line_20423'>dread sore Launcelot, that knew you not. Madam, said Palomides, ye may</a>
<a id='line_20424'>say whatso ye will, I may not contrary you, but by my knighthood I knew</a>
<a id='line_20425'>not Sir Tristram. Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I will take your</a>
<a id='line_20426'>excuse, but well I wot ye spared me but little, but all is pardoned on</a>
<a id='line_20427'>my part. Then La Beale Isoud held down her head and said no more at</a>
<a id='line_20428'>that time.</a>

<a id='line_20434'>pavilions as they sat at supper, and of Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_20435'></a>
<a id='line_20436'></a>
<a id='line_20437'>And therewithal two knights armed came unto the pavilion, and there</a>
<a id='line_20438'>they alighted both, and came in armed at all pieces. Fair knights, said</a>
<a id='line_20439'>Sir Tristram, ye are to blame to come thus armed at all pieces upon me</a>
<a id='line_20440'>while we are at our meat; if ye would anything when we were in the</a>
<a id='line_20441'>field there might ye have eased your hearts. Not so, said the one of</a>
<a id='line_20442'>those knights, we come not for that intent, but wit ye well Sir</a>
<a id='line_20443'>Tristram, we be come hither as your friends. And I am come here, said</a>
<a id='line_20444'>the one, for to see you, and this knight is come for to see La Beale</a>
<a id='line_20445'>Isoud. Then said Sir Tristram: I require you do off your helms that I</a>
<a id='line_20446'>may see you. That will we do at your desire, said the knights. And when</a>
<a id='line_20447'>their helms were off, Sir Tristram thought that he should know them.</a>
<a id='line_20448'></a>
<a id='line_20449'>Then said Sir Dinadan privily unto Sir Tristram: Sir, that is Sir</a>
<a id='line_20450'>Launcelot du Lake that spake unto you first, and the other is my lord</a>
<a id='line_20451'>King Arthur. Then, said Sir Tristram unto La Beale Isoud, Madam arise,</a>
<a id='line_20452'>for here is my lord, King Arthur. Then the king and the queen kissed,</a>
<a id='line_20453'>and Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram braced either other in arms, and</a>
<a id='line_20454'>then there was joy without measure; and at the request of La Beale</a>
<a id='line_20455'>Isoud, King Arthur and Launcelot were unarmed, and then there was merry</a>
<a id='line_20456'>talking. Madam, said Sir Arthur, it is many a day sithen that I have</a>
<a id='line_20457'>desired to see you, for ye have been praised so far; and now I dare say</a>
<a id='line_20458'>ye are the fairest that ever I saw, and Sir Tristram is as fair and as</a>
<a id='line_20459'>good a knight as any that I know; therefore me beseemeth ye are well</a>
<a id='line_20460'>beset together. Sir, God thank you, said the noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_20461'>Tristram, and Isoud; of your great goodness and largess ye are</a>
<a id='line_20462'>peerless. Thus they talked of many things and of all the whole jousts.</a>
<a id='line_20463'>But for what cause, said King Arthur, were ye, Sir Tristram, against</a>
<a id='line_20464'>us? Ye are a knight of the Table Round; of right ye should have been</a>
<a id='line_20465'>with us. Sir, said Sir Tristram, here is Dinadan, and Sir Gareth your</a>
<a id='line_20466'>own nephew, caused me to be against you. My lord Arthur, said Gareth, I</a>
<a id='line_20467'>may well bear the blame, but it were Sir Tristram’s own deeds. That may</a>
<a id='line_20468'>I repent, said Dinadan, for this unhappy Sir Tristram brought us to</a>
<a id='line_20469'>this tournament, and many great buffets he caused us to have. Then the</a>
<a id='line_20470'>king and Launcelot laughed that they might not sit.</a>
<a id='line_20471'></a>
<a id='line_20472'>What knight was that, said Arthur, that held you so short, this with</a>
<a id='line_20473'>the shield of silver? Sir, said Sir Tristram, here he sitteth at this</a>
<a id='line_20474'>board. What, said Arthur, was it Sir Palomides? Wit ye well it was he,</a>
<a id='line_20475'>said La Beale Isoud. So God me help, said Arthur, that was unknightly</a>
<a id='line_20476'>done of you of so good a knight, for I have heard many people call you</a>
<a id='line_20477'>a courteous knight. Sir, said Palomides, I knew not Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_20478'>he was so disguised. So God me help, said Launcelot, it may well be,</a>
<a id='line_20479'>for I knew not Sir Tristram; but I marvel why ye turned on our party.</a>
<a id='line_20480'>That was done for the same cause, said Launcelot. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20481'>Tristram, I have pardoned him, and I would be right loath to leave his</a>
<a id='line_20482'>fellowship, for I love right well his company: so they left off and</a>
<a id='line_20483'>talked of other things.</a>
<a id='line_20484'></a>
<a id='line_20485'>And in the evening King Arthur and Sir Launcelot departed unto their</a>
<a id='line_20486'>lodging; but wit ye well Sir Palomides had envy heartily, for all that</a>
<a id='line_20487'>night he had never rest in his bed, but wailed and wept out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_20488'>So on the morn Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan arose early, and then</a>
<a id='line_20489'>they went unto Sir Palomides’ chamber, and there they found him fast</a>
<a id='line_20490'>asleep, for he had all night watched, and it was seen upon his cheeks</a>
<a id='line_20491'>that he had wept full sore. Say nothing, said Sir Tristram, for I am</a>
<a id='line_20492'>sure he hath taken anger and sorrow for the rebuke that I gave to him,</a>
<a id='line_20493'>and La Beale Isoud.</a>

<a id='line_20499'>how King Arthur was unhorsed.</a>
<a id='line_20500'></a>
<a id='line_20501'></a>
<a id='line_20502'>Then Sir Tristram let call Sir Palomides, and bade him make him ready,</a>
<a id='line_20503'>for it was time to go to the field. When they were ready they were</a>
<a id='line_20504'>armed, and clothed all in red, both Isoud and all they; and so they led</a>
<a id='line_20505'>her passing freshly through the field, into the priory where was her</a>
<a id='line_20506'>lodging. And then they heard three blasts blow, and every king and</a>
<a id='line_20507'>knight dressed him unto the field. And the first that was ready to</a>
<a id='line_20508'>joust was Sir Palomides and Sir Kainus le Strange, a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_20509'>Table Round. And so they two encountered together, but Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20510'>smote Sir Kainus so hard that he smote him quite over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_20511'>croup. And forthwithal Sir Palomides smote down another knight, and</a>
<a id='line_20512'>brake then his spear, and pulled out his sword and did wonderly well.</a>
<a id='line_20513'>And then the noise began greatly upon Sir Palomides. Lo, said King</a>
<a id='line_20514'>Arthur, yonder Palomides beginneth to play his pageant. So God me help,</a>
<a id='line_20515'>said Arthur, he is a passing good knight. And right as they stood</a>
<a id='line_20516'>talking thus, in came Sir Tristram as thunder, and he encountered with</a>
<a id='line_20517'>Sir Kay the Seneschal, and there he smote him down quite from his</a>
<a id='line_20518'>horse; and with that same spear Sir Tristram smote down three knights</a>
<a id='line_20519'>more, and then he pulled out his sword and did marvellously. Then the</a>
<a id='line_20520'>noise and cry changed from Sir Palomides and turned to Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_20521'>and all the people cried: O Tristram, O Tristram. And then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_20522'>Palomides clean forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_20523'></a>
<a id='line_20524'>How now, said Launcelot unto Arthur, yonder rideth a knight that</a>
<a id='line_20525'>playeth his pageants. So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_20526'>shall see this day that yonder two knights shall here do this day</a>
<a id='line_20527'>wonders. Sir, said Launcelot, the one knight waiteth upon the other,</a>
<a id='line_20528'>and enforceth himself through envy to pass the noble knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_20529'>Tristram, and he knoweth not of the privy envy the which Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20530'>hath to him; for all that the noble Sir Tristram doth is through clean</a>
<a id='line_20531'>knighthood. And then Sir Gareth and Dinadan did wonderly great deeds of</a>
<a id='line_20532'>arms, as two noble knights, so that King Arthur spake of them great</a>
<a id='line_20533'>honour and worship; and the kings and knights of Sir Tristram’s side</a>
<a id='line_20534'>did passingly well, and held them truly together. Then Sir Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_20535'>Sir Launcelot took their horses and dressed them, and gat into the</a>
<a id='line_20536'>thickest of the press. And there Sir Tristram unknowing smote down King</a>
<a id='line_20537'>Arthur, and then Sir Launcelot would have rescued him, but there were</a>
<a id='line_20538'>so many upon Sir Launcelot that they pulled him down from his horse.</a>
<a id='line_20539'>And then the King of Ireland and the King of Scots with their knights</a>
<a id='line_20540'>did their pain to take King Arthur and Sir Launcelot prisoner. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_20541'>Launcelot heard them say so, he fared as it had been an hungry lion,</a>
<a id='line_20542'>for he fared so that no knight durst nigh him.</a>
<a id='line_20543'></a>
<a id='line_20544'>Then came Sir Ector de Maris, and he bare a spear against Sir</a>
<a id='line_20545'>Palomides, and brast it upon him all to shivers. And then Sir Ector</a>
<a id='line_20546'>came again and gave Sir Palomides such a dash with a sword that he</a>
<a id='line_20547'>stooped down upon his saddle bow. And forthwithal Sir Ector pulled down</a>
<a id='line_20548'>Sir Palomides under his feet; and then Sir Ector de Maris gat Sir</a>
<a id='line_20549'>Launcelot du Lake an horse, and brought it to him, and bade him mount</a>
<a id='line_20550'>upon him; but Sir Palomides leapt afore and gat the horse by the</a>
<a id='line_20551'>bridle, and leapt into the saddle. So God me help, said Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_20552'>are better worthy to have that horse than I. Then Sir Ector brought Sir</a>
<a id='line_20553'>Launcelot another horse. Gramercy, said Launcelot unto his brother. And</a>
<a id='line_20554'>so when he was horsed again, with one spear he smote down four knights.</a>
<a id='line_20555'>And then Sir Launcelot brought to King Arthur one of the best of the</a>
<a id='line_20556'>four horses. Then Sir Launcelot with King Arthur and a few of his</a>
<a id='line_20557'>knights of Sir Launcelot’s kin did marvellous deeds; for that time, as</a>
<a id='line_20558'>the book recordeth, Sir Launcelot smote down and pulled down thirty</a>
<a id='line_20559'>knights. Notwithstanding the other party held them so fast together</a>
<a id='line_20560'>that King Arthur and his knights were overmatched. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_20561'>Tristram saw that, what labour King Arthur and his knights, and in</a>
<a id='line_20562'>especial the noble deeds that Sir Launcelot did with his own hands, he</a>
<a id='line_20563'>marvelled greatly.</a>
<a id='line_20564'></a>

<a id='line_20568'>CHAPTER LXXX. How Sir Tristram turned to King Arthur’s side, and how</a>
<a id='line_20569'>Palomides would not.</a>
<a id='line_20570'></a>
<a id='line_20571'></a>
<a id='line_20572'>Then Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Palomides, Sir Gareth, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_20573'>Dinadan, and said thus to them: My fair fellows, wit ye well that I</a>
<a id='line_20574'>will turn unto King Arthur’s party, for I saw never so few men do so</a>
<a id='line_20575'>well, and it will be shame unto us knights that be of the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_20576'>to see our lord King Arthur, and that noble knight Sir Launcelot, to be</a>
<a id='line_20577'>dishonoured. It will be well done, said Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan. Do</a>
<a id='line_20578'>your best, said Palomides, for I will not change my party that I came</a>
<a id='line_20579'>in withal. That is for my sake, said Sir Tristram; God speed you in</a>
<a id='line_20580'>your journey. And so departed Sir Palomides from them. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_20581'>Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan, turned with Sir Launcelot. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_20582'>Launcelot smote down the King of Ireland quite from his horse; and so</a>
<a id='line_20583'>Sir Launcelot smote down the King of Scots, and the King of Wales; and</a>
<a id='line_20584'>then Sir Arthur ran unto Sir Palomides and smote him quite from his</a>
<a id='line_20585'>horse; and then Sir Tristram bare down all that he met. Sir Gareth and</a>
<a id='line_20586'>Sir Dinadan did there as noble knights; then all the parties began to</a>
<a id='line_20587'>flee. Alas, said Palomides, that ever I should see this day, for now</a>
<a id='line_20588'>have I lost all the worship that I won; and then Sir Palomides went his</a>
<a id='line_20589'>way wailing, and so withdrew him till he came to a well, and there he</a>
<a id='line_20590'>put his horse from him, and did off his armour, and wailed and wept</a>
<a id='line_20591'>like as he had been a wood man. Then many knights gave the prize to Sir</a>
<a id='line_20592'>Tristram, and there were many that gave the prize unto Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_20593'>Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, I thank you of the honour ye would give</a>
<a id='line_20594'>me, but I pray you heartily that ye would give your voice to Sir</a>
<a id='line_20595'>Launcelot, for by my faith said Sir Tristram, I will give Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_20596'>my voice. But Sir Launcelot would not have it, and so the prize was</a>
<a id='line_20597'>given betwixt them both.</a>
<a id='line_20598'></a>
<a id='line_20599'>Then every man rode to his lodging, and Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector</a>
<a id='line_20600'>rode with Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud unto their pavilions. Then as</a>
<a id='line_20601'>Sir Palomides was at the well wailing and weeping, there came by him</a>
<a id='line_20602'>flying the kings of Wales and of Scotland, and they saw Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20603'>in that arage. Alas, said they, that so noble a man as ye be should be</a>
<a id='line_20604'>in this array. And then those kings gat Sir Palomides’ horse again, and</a>
<a id='line_20605'>made him to arm him and mount upon his horse, and so he rode with them,</a>
<a id='line_20606'>making great dole. So when Sir Palomides came nigh the pavilions</a>
<a id='line_20607'>thereas Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud was in, then Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20608'>prayed the two kings to abide him there the while that he spake with</a>
<a id='line_20609'>Sir Tristram. And when he came to the port of the pavilions, Sir</a>
<a id='line_20610'>Palomides said on high: Where art thou, Sir Tristram de Liones? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_20611'>said Dinadan, that is Palomides. What, Sir Palomides, will ye not come</a>
<a id='line_20612'>in here among us? Fie on thee traitor, said Palomides, for wit you well</a>
<a id='line_20613'>an it were daylight as it is night I should slay thee, mine own hands.</a>
<a id='line_20614'>And if ever I may get thee, said Palomides, thou shalt die for this</a>
<a id='line_20615'>day’s deed. Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, ye wite me with wrong,</a>
<a id='line_20616'>for had ye done as I did ye had won worship. But sithen ye give me so</a>
<a id='line_20617'>large warning I shall be well ware of you. Fie on thee, traitor, said</a>
<a id='line_20618'>Palomides, and therewith departed.</a>
<a id='line_20619'></a>
<a id='line_20620'>Then on the morn Sir Tristram, Bleoberis, and Sir Ector de Maris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_20621'>Gareth, Sir Dinadan, what by water and what by land, they brought La</a>
<a id='line_20622'>Beale Isoud unto Joyous Gard, and there reposed them a seven night, and</a>
<a id='line_20623'>made all the mirths and disports that they could devise. And King</a>
<a id='line_20624'>Arthur and his knights drew unto Camelot, and Sir Palomides rode with</a>
<a id='line_20625'>the two kings; and ever he made the greatest dole that any man could</a>
<a id='line_20626'>think, for he was not all only so dolorous for the departing from La</a>
<a id='line_20627'>Beale Isoud, but he was a part as sorrowful to depart from the</a>
<a id='line_20628'>fellowship of Sir Tristram; for Sir Tristram was so kind and so gentle</a>
<a id='line_20629'>that when Sir Palomides remembered him thereof he might never be merry.</a>

<a id='line_20636'></a>
<a id='line_20637'></a>
<a id='line_20638'>So at the seven nights’ end Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector departed from</a>
<a id='line_20639'>Sir Tristram and from the queen; and these two good knights had great</a>
<a id='line_20640'>gifts; and Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan abode with Sir Tristram. And when</a>
<a id='line_20641'>Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector were come there as the Queen Guenever was</a>
<a id='line_20642'>lodged, in a castle by the seaside, and through the grace of God the</a>
<a id='line_20643'>queen was recovered of her malady, then she asked the two knights from</a>
<a id='line_20644'>whence they came. They said that they came from Sir Tristram and from</a>
<a id='line_20645'>La Beale Isoud. How doth Sir Tristram, said the queen, and La Beale</a>
<a id='line_20646'>Isoud? Truly, said those two knights, he doth as a noble knight should</a>
<a id='line_20647'>do; and as for the Queen Isoud, she is peerless of all ladies; for to</a>
<a id='line_20648'>speak of her beauty, bounté, and mirth, and of her goodness, we saw</a>
<a id='line_20649'>never her match as far as we have ridden and gone. O mercy Jesu, said</a>
<a id='line_20650'>Queen Guenever, so saith all the people that have seen her and spoken</a>
<a id='line_20651'>with her. God would that I had part of her conditions; and it is</a>
<a id='line_20652'>misfortuned me of my sickness while that tournament endured. And as I</a>
<a id='line_20653'>suppose I shall never see in all my life such an assembly of knights</a>
<a id='line_20654'>and ladies as ye have done.</a>
<a id='line_20655'></a>
<a id='line_20656'>Then the knights told her how Palomides won the degree at the first day</a>
<a id='line_20657'>with great noblesse; and the second day Sir Tristram won the degree;</a>
<a id='line_20658'>and the third day Sir Launcelot won the degree. Well, said Queen</a>
<a id='line_20659'>Guenever, who did best all these three days? So God me help, said these</a>
<a id='line_20660'>knights, Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram had least dishonour. And wit ye</a>
<a id='line_20661'>well Sir Palomides did passing well and mightily; but he turned against</a>
<a id='line_20662'>the party that he came in withal, and that caused him to lose a great</a>
<a id='line_20663'>part of his worship, for it seemed that Sir Palomides is passing</a>
<a id='line_20664'>envious. Then shall he never win worship, said Queen Guenever, for an</a>
<a id='line_20665'>it happeth an envious man once to win worship he shall be dishonoured</a>
<a id='line_20666'>twice therefore; and for this cause all men of worship hate an envious</a>
<a id='line_20667'>man, and will shew him no favour, and he that is courteous, and kind,</a>
<a id='line_20668'>and gentle, hath favour in every place.</a>

<a id='line_20680'>great courser, and the King of Scotland gave him great gifts; and fain</a>
<a id='line_20681'>they would have had Sir Palomides to have abiden with them, but in no</a>
<a id='line_20682'>wise he would abide; and so he departed, and rode as adventures would</a>
<a id='line_20683'>guide him, till it was nigh noon. And then in a forest by a well Sir</a>
<a id='line_20684'>Palomides saw where lay a fair wounded knight and his horse bounden by</a>
<a id='line_20685'>him; and that knight made the greatest dole that ever he heard man</a>
<a id='line_20686'>make, for ever he wept, and therewith he sighed as though he would die.</a>
<a id='line_20687'>Then Sir Palomides rode near him and saluted him mildly and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_20688'>knight, why wail ye so? let me lie down and wail with you, for doubt</a>
<a id='line_20689'>not I am much more heavier than ye are; for I dare say, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_20690'>that my sorrow is an hundred fold more than yours is, and therefore let</a>
<a id='line_20691'>us complain either to other. First, said the wounded knight, I require</a>
<a id='line_20692'>you tell me your name, for an thou be none of the noble knights of the</a>
<a id='line_20693'>Round Table thou shalt never know my name, whatsomever come of me. Fair</a>
<a id='line_20694'>knight, said Palomides, such as I am, be it better or be it worse, wit</a>
<a id='line_20695'>thou well that my name is Sir Palomides, son and heir unto King</a>
<a id='line_20696'>Astlabor, and Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides are my two brethren; and</a>
<a id='line_20697'>wit thou well as for myself I was never christened, but my two brethren</a>
<a id='line_20698'>are truly christened. O noble knight, said that knight, well is me that</a>
<a id='line_20699'>I have met with you; and wit ye well my name is Epinogris, the king’s</a>
<a id='line_20700'>son of Northumberland. Now sit down, said Epinogris, and let us either</a>
<a id='line_20701'>complain to other.</a>
<a id='line_20702'></a>
<a id='line_20703'>Then Sir Palomides began his complaint. Now shall I tell you, said</a>
<a id='line_20704'>Palomides, what woe I endure. I love the fairest queen and lady that</a>
<a id='line_20705'>ever bare life, and wit ye well her name is La Beale Isoud, King Mark’s</a>
<a id='line_20706'>wife of Cornwall. That is great folly, said Epinogris, for to love</a>
<a id='line_20707'>Queen Isoud, for one of the best knights of the world loveth her, that</a>
<a id='line_20708'>is Sir Tristram de Liones. That is truth, said Palomides, for no man</a>
<a id='line_20709'>knoweth that matter better than I do, for I have been in Sir Tristram’s</a>
<a id='line_20710'>fellowship this month, and with La Beale Isoud together; and alas, said</a>
<a id='line_20711'>Palomides, unhappy man that I am, now have I lost the fellowship of Sir</a>
<a id='line_20712'>Tristram for ever, and the love of La Beale Isoud for ever, and I am</a>
<a id='line_20713'>never like to see her more, and Sir Tristram and I be either to other</a>
<a id='line_20714'>mortal enemies. Well, said Epinogris, sith that ye loved La Beale</a>
<a id='line_20715'>Isoud, loved she you ever again by anything that ye could think or wit,</a>
<a id='line_20716'>or else did ye rejoice her ever in any pleasure? Nay, by my knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_20717'>said Palomides, I never espied that ever she loved me more than all the</a>
<a id='line_20718'>world, nor never had I pleasure with her, but the last day she gave me</a>
<a id='line_20719'>the greatest rebuke that ever I had, the which shall never go from my</a>
<a id='line_20720'>heart. And yet I well deserved that rebuke, for I did not knightly, and</a>
<a id='line_20721'>therefore I have lost the love of her and of Sir Tristram for ever; and</a>
<a id='line_20722'>I have many times enforced myself to do many deeds for La Beale Isoud’s</a>
<a id='line_20723'>sake, and she was the causer of my worship-winning. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20724'>Palomides, now have I lost all the worship that ever I won, for never</a>
<a id='line_20725'>shall me befall such prowess as I had in the fellowship of Sir</a>
<a id='line_20726'>Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_20727'></a>
<a id='line_20728'></a>
<a id='line_20729'></a>
<a id='line_20730'></a>
<a id='line_20731'>CHAPTER LXXXIII. How Sir Palomides brought Sir Epinogris his lady; and</a>
<a id='line_20732'>how Sir Palomides and Sir Safere were assailed.</a>
<a id='line_20733'></a>
<a id='line_20734'></a>
<a id='line_20735'>Nay, nay, said Epinogris, your sorrow is but japes to my sorrow; for I</a>
<a id='line_20736'>rejoiced my lady and won her with my hands, and lost her again: alas</a>
<a id='line_20737'>that day! Thus first I won her, said Epinogris; my lady was an earl’s</a>
<a id='line_20738'>daughter, and as the earl and two knights came from the tournament of</a>
<a id='line_20739'>Lonazep, for her sake I set upon this earl and on his two knights, my</a>
<a id='line_20740'>lady there being present; and so by fortune there I slew the earl and</a>
<a id='line_20741'>one of the knights, and the other knight fled, and so that night I had</a>
<a id='line_20742'>my lady. And on the morn as she and I reposed us at this well-side</a>
<a id='line_20743'>there came there to me an errant knight, his name was Sir Helior le</a>
<a id='line_20744'>Preuse, an hardy knight, and this Sir Helior challenged me to fight for</a>
<a id='line_20745'>my lady. And then we went to battle first upon horse and after on foot,</a>
<a id='line_20746'>but at the last Sir Helior wounded me so that he left me for dead, and</a>
<a id='line_20747'>so he took my lady with him; and thus my sorrow is more than yours, for</a>
<a id='line_20748'>I have rejoiced and ye rejoiced never. That is truth, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_20749'>but sith I can never recover myself I shall promise you if I can meet</a>
<a id='line_20750'>with Sir Helior I shall get you your lady again, or else he shall beat</a>
<a id='line_20751'>me.</a>
<a id='line_20752'></a>
<a id='line_20753'>Then Sir Palomides made Sir Epinogris to take his horse, and so they</a>
<a id='line_20754'>rode to an hermitage, and there Sir Epinogris rested him. And in the</a>
<a id='line_20755'>meanwhile Sir Palomides walked privily out to rest him under the</a>
<a id='line_20756'>leaves, and there beside he saw a knight come riding with a shield that</a>
<a id='line_20757'>he had seen Sir Ector de Maris bear beforehand; and there came after</a>
<a id='line_20758'>him a ten knights, and so these ten knights hoved under the leaves for</a>
<a id='line_20759'>heat. And anon after there came a knight with a green shield and</a>
<a id='line_20760'>therein a white lion, leading a lady upon a palfrey. Then this knight</a>
<a id='line_20761'>with the green shield that seemed to be master of the ten knights, he</a>
<a id='line_20762'>rode fiercely after Sir Helior, for it was he that hurt Sir Epinogris.</a>
<a id='line_20763'>And when he came nigh Sir Helior he bade him defend his lady. I will</a>
<a id='line_20764'>defend her, said Helior, unto my power. And so they ran together so</a>
<a id='line_20765'>mightily that either of these knights smote other down, horse and all,</a>
<a id='line_20766'>to the earth; and then they won up lightly and drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_20767'>their shields, and lashed together mightily more than an hour. All this</a>
<a id='line_20768'>Sir Palomides saw and beheld, but ever at the last the knight with Sir</a>
<a id='line_20769'>Ector’s shield was bigger, and at the last this knight smote Sir Helior</a>
<a id='line_20770'>down, and then that knight unlaced his helm to have stricken off his</a>
<a id='line_20771'>head. And then he cried mercy, and prayed him to save his life, and</a>
<a id='line_20772'>bade him take his lady. Then Sir Palomides dressed him up, because he</a>
<a id='line_20773'>wist well that that same lady was Epinogris’ lady, and he promised him</a>
<a id='line_20774'>to help him.</a>
<a id='line_20775'></a>
<a id='line_20776'>Then Sir Palomides went straight to that lady, and took her by the</a>
<a id='line_20777'>hand, and asked her whether she knew a knight that hight Epinogris.</a>
<a id='line_20778'>Alas, she said, that ever he knew me or I him, for I have for his sake</a>
<a id='line_20779'>lost my worship, and also his life grieveth me most of all. Not so,</a>
<a id='line_20780'>lady, said Palomides, come on with me, for here is Epinogris in this</a>
<a id='line_20781'>hermitage. Ah! well is me, said the lady, an he be alive. Whither wilt</a>
<a id='line_20782'>thou with that lady? said the knight with Sir Ector’s shield. I will do</a>
<a id='line_20783'>with her what me list, said Palomides. Wit you well, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_20784'>thou speakest over large, though thou seemest me to have at advantage,</a>
<a id='line_20785'>because thou sawest me do battle but late. Thou weenest, sir knight, to</a>
<a id='line_20786'>have that lady away from me so lightly? nay, think it never not; an</a>
<a id='line_20787'>thou were as good a knight as is Sir Launcelot, or as is Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_20788'>or Sir Palomides, but thou shalt win her dearer than ever did I. And so</a>
<a id='line_20789'>they went unto battle upon foot, and there they gave many sad strokes,</a>
<a id='line_20790'>and either wounded other passing sore, and thus they fought still more</a>
<a id='line_20791'>than an hour.</a>
<a id='line_20792'></a>
<a id='line_20793'>Then Sir Palomides had marvel what knight he might be that was so</a>
<a id='line_20794'>strong and so well breathed during, and thus said Palomides: Knight, I</a>
<a id='line_20795'>require thee tell me thy name. Wit thou well, said that knight, I dare</a>
<a id='line_20796'>tell thee my name, so that thou wilt tell me thy name. I will, said</a>
<a id='line_20797'>Palomides. Truly, said that knight, my name is Safere, son of King</a>
<a id='line_20798'>Astlabor, and Sir Palomides and Sir Segwarides are my brethren. Now,</a>
<a id='line_20799'>and wit thou well, my name is Sir Palomides. Then Sir Safere kneeled</a>
<a id='line_20800'>down upon his knees, and prayed him of mercy; and then they unlaced</a>
<a id='line_20801'>their helms and either kissed other weeping. And in the meanwhile Sir</a>
<a id='line_20802'>Epinogris arose out of his bed, and heard them by the strokes, and so</a>
<a id='line_20803'>he armed him to help Sir Palomides if need were.</a>
<a id='line_20804'></a>
<a id='line_20805'></a>
<a id='line_20806'></a>
<a id='line_20807'></a>
<a id='line_20808'>CHAPTER LXXXIV. How Sir Palomides and Sir Safere conducted Sir</a>
<a id='line_20809'>Epinogris to his castle, and of other adventures.</a>
<a id='line_20810'></a>
<a id='line_20811'></a>
<a id='line_20812'>Then Sir Palomides took the lady by the hand and brought her to Sir</a>
<a id='line_20813'>Epinogris, and there was great joy betwixt them, for either swooned for</a>
<a id='line_20814'>joy. When they were met: Fair knight and lady, said Sir Safere, it were</a>
<a id='line_20815'>pity to depart you; Jesu send you joy either of other. Gramercy, gentle</a>
<a id='line_20816'>knight, said Epinogris; and much more thanks be to my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_20817'>Palomides, that thus hath through his prowess made me to get my lady.</a>
<a id='line_20818'>Then Sir Epinogris required Sir Palomides and Sir Safere, his brother,</a>
<a id='line_20819'>to ride with them unto his castle, for the safeguard of his person.</a>
<a id='line_20820'>Sir, said Palomides, we will be ready to conduct you because that ye</a>
<a id='line_20821'>are sore wounded; and so was Epinogris and his lady horsed, and his</a>
<a id='line_20822'>lady behind him upon a soft ambler. And then they rode unto his castle,</a>
<a id='line_20823'>where they had great cheer and joy, as great as ever Sir Palomides and</a>
<a id='line_20824'>Sir Safere had in their life-days.</a>
<a id='line_20825'></a>
<a id='line_20826'>So on the morn Sir Safere and Sir Palomides departed, day until after</a>
<a id='line_20827'>noon. And at the last they heard a great weeping and a great noise down</a>
<a id='line_20828'>in a manor. Sir, said then Sir Safere, let us wit what noise this is. I</a>
<a id='line_20829'>will well, said Sir Palomides. And so they rode forth till that they</a>
<a id='line_20830'>came to a fair gate of a manor, and there sat an old man saying his</a>
<a id='line_20831'>prayers and beads. Then Sir Palomides and Sir Safere alighted and left</a>
<a id='line_20832'>their horses, and went within the gates, and there they saw full many</a>
<a id='line_20833'>goodly men weeping. Fair sirs, said Palomides, wherefore weep ye and</a>
<a id='line_20834'>make this sorrow? Anon one of the knights of the castle beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_20835'>Palomides and knew him, and then went to his fellows and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_20836'>fellows, wit ye well all, we have in this castle the same knight that</a>
<a id='line_20837'>slew our lord at Lonazep, for I know him well; it is Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_20838'>Then they went unto harness, all that might bear harness, some on</a>
<a id='line_20839'>horseback and some on foot, to the number of three score. And when they</a>
<a id='line_20840'>were ready they came freshly upon Sir Palomides and upon Sir Safere</a>
<a id='line_20841'>with a great noise, and said thus: Keep thee, Sir Palomides, for thou</a>
<a id='line_20842'>art known, and by right thou must be dead, for thou hast slain our</a>
<a id='line_20843'>lord; and therefore wit ye well we will slay thee, therefore defend</a>
<a id='line_20844'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_20845'></a>
<a id='line_20846'>Then Sir Palomides and Sir Safere, the one set his back to the other,</a>
<a id='line_20847'>and gave many great strokes, and took many great strokes; and thus they</a>
<a id='line_20848'>fought with a twenty knights and forty gentlemen and yeomen nigh two</a>
<a id='line_20849'>hours. But at the last though they were loath, Sir Palomides and Sir</a>
<a id='line_20850'>Safere were taken and yolden, and put in a strong prison; and within</a>
<a id='line_20851'>three days twelve knights passed upon them, and they found Sir</a>
<a id='line_20852'>Palomides guilty, and Sir Safere not guilty, of their lord’s death. And</a>
<a id='line_20853'>when Sir Safere should be delivered there was great dole betwixt Sir</a>
<a id='line_20854'>Palomides and him, and many piteous complaints that Sir Safere made at</a>
<a id='line_20855'>his departing, there is no maker can rehearse the tenth part. Fair</a>
<a id='line_20856'>brother, said Palomides, let be thy dolour and thy sorrow. And if I be</a>
<a id='line_20857'>ordained to die a shameful death, welcome be it; but an I had wist of</a>
<a id='line_20858'>this death that I am deemed unto, I should never have been yolden. So</a>
<a id='line_20859'>Sir Safere departed from his brother with the greatest dolour and</a>
<a id='line_20860'>sorrow that ever made knight.</a>
<a id='line_20861'></a>
<a id='line_20862'>And on the morn they of the castle ordained twelve knights to ride with</a>
<a id='line_20863'>Sir Palomides unto the father of the same knight that Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20864'>slew; and so they bound his legs under an old steed’s belly. And then</a>
<a id='line_20865'>they rode with Sir Palomides unto a castle by the seaside, that hight</a>
<a id='line_20866'>Pelownes, and there Sir Palomides should have justice. Thus was their</a>
<a id='line_20867'>ordinance; and so they rode with Sir Palomides fast by the castle of</a>
<a id='line_20868'>Joyous Gard. And as they passed by that castle there came riding out of</a>
<a id='line_20869'>that castle by them one that knew Sir Palomides. And when that knight</a>
<a id='line_20870'>saw Sir Palomides bounden upon a crooked courser, the knight asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_20871'>Palomides for what cause he was led so. Ah, my fair fellow and knight,</a>
<a id='line_20872'>said Palomides, I ride toward my death for the slaying of a knight at a</a>
<a id='line_20873'>tournament of Lonazep; and if I had not departed from my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_20874'>Tristram, as I ought not to have done, now might I have been sure to</a>
<a id='line_20875'>have had my life saved; but I pray you, sir knight, recommend me unto</a>
<a id='line_20876'>my lord, Sir Tristram, and unto my lady, Queen Isoud, and say to them</a>
<a id='line_20877'>if ever I trespassed to them I ask them forgiveness. And also I beseech</a>
<a id='line_20878'>you recommend me unto my lord, King Arthur, and to all the fellowship</a>
<a id='line_20879'>of the Round Table, unto my power. Then that knight wept for pity of</a>
<a id='line_20880'>Sir Palomides; and therewithal he rode unto Joyous Gard as fast as his</a>
<a id='line_20881'>horse might run, and lightly that knight descended down off his horse</a>
<a id='line_20882'>and went unto Sir Tristram, and there he told him all as ye have heard,</a>
<a id='line_20883'>and ever the knight wept as he had been mad.</a>
<a id='line_20884'></a>
<a id='line_20885'></a>
<a id='line_20886'></a>
<a id='line_20887'></a>
<a id='line_20888'>CHAPTER LXXXV. How Sir Tristram made him ready to rescue Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_20889'>but Sir Launcelot rescued him or he came.</a>
<a id='line_20890'></a>
<a id='line_20891'></a>
<a id='line_20892'>When Sir Tristram heard how Sir Palomides went to his death, he was</a>
<a id='line_20893'>heavy to hear that, and said: Howbeit that I am wroth with Sir</a>
<a id='line_20894'>Palomides, yet will not I suffer him to die so shameful a death, for he</a>
<a id='line_20895'>is a full noble knight. And then anon Sir Tristram was armed and took</a>
<a id='line_20896'>his horse and two squires with him, and rode a great pace toward the</a>
<a id='line_20897'>castle of Pelownes where Sir Palomides was judged to death. And these</a>
<a id='line_20898'>twelve knights that led Sir Palomides passed by a well whereas Sir</a>
<a id='line_20899'>Launcelot was, which was alighted there, and had tied his horse to a</a>
<a id='line_20900'>tree, and taken off his helm to drink of that well; and when he saw</a>
<a id='line_20901'>these knights, Sir Launcelot put on his helm and suffered them to pass</a>
<a id='line_20902'>by him. And then was he ware of Sir Palomides bounden, and led</a>
<a id='line_20903'>shamefully to his death. O Jesu, said Launcelot, what misadventure is</a>
<a id='line_20904'>befallen him that he is thus led toward his death? Forsooth, said</a>
<a id='line_20905'>Launcelot, it were shame to me to suffer this noble knight so to die an</a>
<a id='line_20906'>I might help him, therefore I will help him whatsomever come of it, or</a>
<a id='line_20907'>else I shall die for Sir Palomides’ sake. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_20908'>mounted upon his horse, and gat his spear in his hand, and rode after</a>
<a id='line_20909'>the twelve knights that led Sir Palomides. Fair knights, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20910'>Launcelot, whither lead ye that knight? it beseemeth him full ill to</a>
<a id='line_20911'>ride bounden. Then these twelve knights suddenly turned their horses</a>
<a id='line_20912'>and said to Sir Launcelot: Sir knight, we counsel thee not to meddle</a>
<a id='line_20913'>with this knight, for he hath deserved death, and unto death he is</a>
<a id='line_20914'>judged. That me repenteth, said Launcelot, that I may not borrow him</a>
<a id='line_20915'>with fairness, for he is over good a knight to die such a shameful</a>
<a id='line_20916'>death. And therefore, fair knights, said Sir Launcelot, keep you as</a>
<a id='line_20917'>well as ye can, for I will rescue that knight or die for it.</a>
<a id='line_20918'></a>
<a id='line_20919'>Then they began to dress their spears, and Sir Launcelot smote the</a>
<a id='line_20920'>foremost down, horse and man, and so he served three more with one</a>
<a id='line_20921'>spear; and then that spear brast, and therewithal Sir Launcelot drew</a>
<a id='line_20922'>his sword, and then he smote on the right hand and on the left hand.</a>
<a id='line_20923'>Then within a while he left none of those twelve knights, but he had</a>
<a id='line_20924'>laid them to the earth, and the most part of them were sore wounded.</a>
<a id='line_20925'>And then Sir Launcelot took the best horse that he found, and loosed</a>
<a id='line_20926'>Sir Palomides and set him upon that horse; and so they returned again</a>
<a id='line_20927'>unto Joyous Gard, and then was Sir Palomides ware of Sir Tristram how</a>
<a id='line_20928'>he came riding. And when Sir Launcelot saw him he knew him well, but</a>
<a id='line_20929'>Sir Tristram knew him not because Sir Launcelot had on his shoulder a</a>
<a id='line_20930'>golden shield. So Sir Launcelot made him ready to joust with Sir</a>
<a id='line_20931'>Tristram, that Sir Tristram should not ween that he were Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_20932'>Then Sir Palomides cried aloud to Sir Tristram: O my lord, I require</a>
<a id='line_20933'>you joust not with this knight, for this good knight hath saved me from</a>
<a id='line_20934'>my death. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he came a soft trotting</a>
<a id='line_20935'>pace toward them. And then Sir Palomides said: My lord, Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_20936'>much am I beholding unto you of your great goodness, that would proffer</a>
<a id='line_20937'>your noble body to rescue me undeserved, for I have greatly offended</a>
<a id='line_20938'>you. Notwithstanding, said Sir Palomides, here met we with this noble</a>
<a id='line_20939'>knight that worshipfully and manly rescued me from twelve knights, and</a>
<a id='line_20940'>smote them down all and wounded them sore.</a>

<a id='line_20945'>CHAPTER LXXXVI. How Sir Tristram and Launcelot, with Palomides, came to</a>
<a id='line_20946'>joyous Gard; and of Palomides and Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_20947'></a>
<a id='line_20948'></a>
<a id='line_20949'>Fair knight, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Launcelot, of whence be ye? I</a>
<a id='line_20950'>am a knight errant, said Sir Launcelot, that rideth to seek many</a>
<a id='line_20951'>adventures. What is your name? said Sir Tristram. Sir, at this time I</a>
<a id='line_20952'>will not tell you. Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Tristram and to</a>
<a id='line_20953'>Palomides: Now either of you are met together I will depart from you.</a>
<a id='line_20954'>Not so, said Sir Tristram; I pray you of knighthood to ride with me</a>
<a id='line_20955'>unto my castle. Wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride with</a>
<a id='line_20956'>you, for I have many deeds to do in other places, that at this time I</a>
<a id='line_20957'>may not abide with you. Ah, mercy Jesu, said Sir Tristram, I require</a>
<a id='line_20958'>you as ye be a true knight to the order of knighthood, play you with me</a>
<a id='line_20959'>this night. Then Sir Tristram had a grant of Sir Launcelot: howbeit</a>
<a id='line_20960'>though he had not desired him he would have ridden with them, outher</a>
<a id='line_20961'>soon have come after them; for Sir Launcelot came for none other cause</a>
<a id='line_20962'>into that country but for to see Sir Tristram. And when they were come</a>
<a id='line_20963'>within Joyous Gard they alighted, and their horses were led into a</a>
<a id='line_20964'>stable; and then they unarmed them. And when Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_20965'>unhelmed, Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides knew him. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_20966'>took Sir Launcelot in arms, and so did La Beale Isoud; and Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20967'>kneeled down upon his knees and thanked Sir Launcelot. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_20968'>Launcelot saw Sir Palomides kneel he lightly took him up and said thus:</a>
<a id='line_20969'>Wit thou well, Sir Palomides, I and any knight in this land, of worship</a>
<a id='line_20970'>ought of very right succour and rescue so noble a knight as ye are</a>
<a id='line_20971'>proved and renowned, throughout all this realm endlong and overthwart.</a>
<a id='line_20972'>And then was there joy among them, and the oftener that Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_20973'>saw La Beale Isoud the heavier he waxed day by day.</a>
<a id='line_20974'></a>
<a id='line_20975'>Then Sir Launcelot within three or four days departed, and with him</a>
<a id='line_20976'>rode Sir Ector de Maris; and Dinadan and Sir Palomides were there left</a>
<a id='line_20977'>with Sir Tristram a two months and more. But ever Sir Palomides faded</a>
<a id='line_20978'>and mourned, that all men had marvel wherefore he faded so away. So</a>
<a id='line_20979'>upon a day, in the dawning, Sir Palomides went into the forest by</a>
<a id='line_20980'>himself alone; and there he found a well, and then he looked into the</a>
<a id='line_20981'>well, and in the water he saw his own visage, how he was disturbed and</a>
<a id='line_20982'>defaded, nothing like that he was. What may this mean? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_20983'>Palomides, and thus he said to himself: Ah, Palomides, Palomides, why</a>
<a id='line_20984'>art thou defaded, thou that was wont to be called one of the fairest</a>
<a id='line_20985'>knights of the world? I will no more lead this life, for I love that I</a>
<a id='line_20986'>may never get nor recover. And therewithal he laid him down by the</a>
<a id='line_20987'>well. And then he began to make a rhyme of La Beale Isoud and him.</a>
<a id='line_20988'></a>
<a id='line_20989'>And in the meanwhile Sir Tristram was that same day ridden into the</a>
<a id='line_20990'>forest to chase the hart of greese; but Sir Tristram would not ride</a>
<a id='line_20991'>a-hunting never more unarmed, because of Sir Breuse Saunce Pité. And so</a>
<a id='line_20992'>as Sir Tristram rode into that forest up and down, he heard one sing</a>
<a id='line_20993'>marvellously loud, and that was Sir Palomides that lay by the well. And</a>
<a id='line_20994'>then Sir Tristram rode softly thither, for he deemed there was some</a>
<a id='line_20995'>knight errant that was at the well. And when Sir Tristram came nigh him</a>
<a id='line_20996'>he descended down from his horse and tied his horse fast till a tree,</a>
<a id='line_20997'>and then he came near him on foot; and anon he was ware where lay Sir</a>
<a id='line_20998'>Palomides by the well and sang loud and merrily; and ever the</a>
<a id='line_20999'>complaints were of that noble queen, La Beale Isoud, the which was</a>
<a id='line_21000'>marvellously and wonderfully well said, and full dolefully and</a>
<a id='line_21001'>piteously made. And all the whole song the noble knight, Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_21002'>heard from the beginning to the ending, the which grieved and troubled</a>
<a id='line_21003'>him sore.</a>
<a id='line_21004'></a>
<a id='line_21005'>But then at the last, when Sir Tristram had heard all Sir Palomides’</a>
<a id='line_21006'>complaints, he was wroth out of measure, and thought for to slay him</a>
<a id='line_21007'>thereas he lay. Then Sir Tristram remembered himself that Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_21008'>was unarmed, and of the noble name that Sir Palomides had, and the</a>
<a id='line_21009'>noble name that himself had, and then he made a restraint of his anger;</a>
<a id='line_21010'>and so he went unto Sir Palomides a soft pace and said: Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_21011'>I have heard your complaint, and of thy treason that thou hast owed me</a>
<a id='line_21012'>so long, and wit thou well therefore thou shalt die; and if it were not</a>
<a id='line_21013'>for shame of knighthood thou shouldest not escape my hands, for now I</a>
<a id='line_21014'>know well thou hast awaited me with treason. Tell me, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21015'>Tristram, how thou wilt acquit thee? Sir, said Palomides, thus I will</a>
<a id='line_21016'>acquit me: as for Queen La Beale Isoud, ye shall wit well that I love</a>
<a id='line_21017'>her above all other ladies in this world; and well I wot it shall</a>
<a id='line_21018'>befall me as for her love as befell to the noble knight Sir Kehydius,</a>
<a id='line_21019'>that died for the love of La Beale Isoud. And now, Sir Tristram, I will</a>
<a id='line_21020'>that ye wit that I have loved La Beale Isoud many a day, and she hath</a>
<a id='line_21021'>been the causer of my worship, and else I had been the most simplest</a>
<a id='line_21022'>knight in the world. For by her, and because of her, I have won the</a>
<a id='line_21023'>worship that I have; for when I remembered me of La Beale Isoud I won</a>
<a id='line_21024'>the worship wheresomever I came for the most part; and yet had I never</a>
<a id='line_21025'>reward nor bounté of her the days of my life, and yet have I been her</a>
<a id='line_21026'>knight guerdonless. And therefore, Sir Tristram, as for any death I</a>
<a id='line_21027'>dread not, for I had as lief die as to live. And if I were armed as</a>
<a id='line_21028'>thou art, I should lightly do battle with thee. Well have ye uttered</a>
<a id='line_21029'>your treason, said Tristram. I have done to you no treason, said</a>
<a id='line_21030'>Palomides, for love is free for all men, and though I have loved your</a>
<a id='line_21031'>lady, she is my lady as well as yours; howbeit I have wrong if any</a>
<a id='line_21032'>wrong be, for ye rejoice her, and have your desire of her, and so had I</a>
<a id='line_21033'>never nor never am like to have, and yet shall I love her to the</a>
<a id='line_21034'>uttermost days of my life as well as ye.</a>
<a id='line_21035'></a>
<a id='line_21036'></a>

<a id='line_21039'>CHAPTER LXXXVII. How there was a day set between Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_21040'>Palomides for to fight, and how Sir Tristram was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_21041'></a>
<a id='line_21042'></a>
<a id='line_21043'>Then said Sir Tristram: I will fight with you to the uttermost. I</a>
<a id='line_21044'>grant, said Palomides, for in a better quarrel keep I never to fight,</a>
<a id='line_21045'>for an I die of your hands, of a better knight’s hands may I not be</a>
<a id='line_21046'>slain. And sithen I understand that I shall never rejoice La Beale</a>
<a id='line_21047'>Isoud, I have as good will to die as to live. Then set ye a day, said</a>
<a id='line_21048'>Sir Tristram, that we shall do battle. This day fifteen days, said</a>
<a id='line_21049'>Palomides, will I meet with you hereby, in the meadow under Joyous</a>
<a id='line_21050'>Gard. Fie for shame, said Sir Tristram, will ye set so long day? let us</a>
<a id='line_21051'>fight to-morn. Not so, said Palomides, for I am meagre, and have been</a>
<a id='line_21052'>long sick for the love of La Beale Isoud, and therefore I will repose</a>
<a id='line_21053'>me till I have my strength again. So then Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_21054'>Palomides promised faith fully to meet at the well that day fifteen</a>
<a id='line_21055'>days. I am remembered, said Sir Tristram to Palomides, that ye brake me</a>
<a id='line_21056'>once a promise when that I rescued you from Breuse Saunce Pité and nine</a>
<a id='line_21057'>knights; and then ye promised me to meet me at the peron and the grave</a>
<a id='line_21058'>beside Camelot, whereas at that time ye failed of your promise. Wit you</a>
<a id='line_21059'>well, said Palomides unto Sir Tristram, I was at that day in prison, so</a>
<a id='line_21060'>that I might not hold my promise. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, an</a>
<a id='line_21061'>ye had holden your promise this work had not been here now at this</a>
<a id='line_21062'>time.</a>
<a id='line_21063'></a>
<a id='line_21064'>Right so departed Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides. And so Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_21065'>took his horse and his harness, and he rode unto King Arthur’s court;</a>
<a id='line_21066'>and there Sir Palomides gat him four knights and four</a>
<a id='line_21067'>sergeants-of-arms, and so he returned againward unto Joyous Gard. And</a>
<a id='line_21068'>in the meanwhile Sir Tristram chased and hunted at all manner of</a>
<a id='line_21069'>venery; and about three days afore the battle should be, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_21070'>Tristram chased an hart, there was an archer shot at the hart, and by</a>
<a id='line_21071'>misfortune he smote Sir Tristram in the thick of the thigh, and the</a>
<a id='line_21072'>arrow slew Sir Tristram’s horse and hurt him. When Sir Tristram was so</a>
<a id='line_21073'>hurt he was passing heavy, and wit ye well he bled sore; and then he</a>
<a id='line_21074'>took another horse, and rode unto Joyous Gard with great heaviness,</a>
<a id='line_21075'>more for the promise that he had made with Sir Palomides, as to do</a>
<a id='line_21076'>battle with him within three days after, than for any hurt of his</a>
<a id='line_21077'>thigh. Wherefore there was neither man nor woman that could cheer him</a>
<a id='line_21078'>with anything that they could make to him, neither Queen La Beale</a>
<a id='line_21079'>Isoud; for ever he deemed that Sir Palomides had smitten him so that he</a>
<a id='line_21080'>should not be able to do battle with him at the day set.</a>
<a id='line_21081'></a>

<a id='line_21085'>CHAPTER LXXXVIII. How Sir Palomides kept his day to have foughten, but</a>
<a id='line_21086'>Sir Tristram might not come; and other things.</a>
<a id='line_21087'></a>
<a id='line_21088'></a>
<a id='line_21089'>But in no wise there was no knight about Sir Tristram that would</a>
<a id='line_21090'>believe that ever Sir Palomides would hurt Sir Tristram, neither by his</a>
<a id='line_21091'>own hands nor by none other consenting. Then when the fifteenth day was</a>
<a id='line_21092'>come, Sir Palomides came to the well with four knights with him of</a>
<a id='line_21093'>Arthur’s court, and three sergeants-of-arms. And for this intent Sir</a>
<a id='line_21094'>Palomides brought the knights with him and the sergeants-of-arms, for</a>
<a id='line_21095'>they should bear record of the battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_21096'>Palomides. And the one sergeant brought in his helm, the other his</a>
<a id='line_21097'>spear, the third his sword. So thus Palomides came into the field, and</a>
<a id='line_21098'>there he abode nigh two hours; and then he sent a squire unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_21099'>Tristram, and desired him to come into the field to hold his promise.</a>
<a id='line_21100'></a>
<a id='line_21101'>When the squire was come to Joyous Gard, anon as Sir Tristram heard of</a>
<a id='line_21102'>his coming he let command that the squire should come to his presence</a>
<a id='line_21103'>thereas he lay in his bed. My lord Sir Tristram, said Palomides’</a>
<a id='line_21104'>squire, wit you well my lord, Palomides, abideth you in the field, and</a>
<a id='line_21105'>he would wit whether ye would do battle or not. Ah, my fair brother,</a>
<a id='line_21106'>said Sir Tristram, wit thou well that I am right heavy for these</a>
<a id='line_21107'>tidings; therefore tell Sir Palomides an I were well at ease I would</a>
<a id='line_21108'>not lie here, nor he should have no need to send for me an I might</a>
<a id='line_21109'>either ride or go; and for thou shalt say that I am no liar—Sir</a>
<a id='line_21110'>Tristram showed him his thigh that the wound was six inches deep. And</a>
<a id='line_21111'>now thou hast seen my hurt, tell thy lord that this is no feigned</a>
<a id='line_21112'>matter, and tell him that I had liefer than all the gold of King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_21113'>that I were whole; and tell Palomides as soon as I am whole I shall</a>
<a id='line_21114'>seek him endlong and overthwart, and that I promise you as I am true</a>
<a id='line_21115'>knight; and if ever I may meet with him, he shall have battle of me his</a>
<a id='line_21116'>fill. And with this the squire departed; and when Palomides wist that</a>
<a id='line_21117'>Tristram was hurt he was glad and said: Now I am sure I shall have no</a>
<a id='line_21118'>shame, for I wot well I should have had hard handling of him, and by</a>
<a id='line_21119'>likely I must needs have had the worse, for he is the hardest knight in</a>
<a id='line_21120'>battle that now is living except Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_21121'></a>
<a id='line_21122'>And then departed Sir Palomides whereas fortune led him, and within a</a>
<a id='line_21123'>month Sir Tristram was whole of his hurt. And then he took his horse,</a>
<a id='line_21124'>and rode from country to country, and all strange adventures he</a>
<a id='line_21125'>achieved wheresomever he rode; and always he enquired for Sir</a>
<a id='line_21126'>Palomides, but of all that quarter of summer Sir Tristram could never</a>
<a id='line_21127'>meet with Sir Palomides. But thus as Sir Tristram sought and enquired</a>
<a id='line_21128'>after Sir Palomides Sir Tristram achieved many great battles,</a>
<a id='line_21129'>wherethrough all the noise fell to Sir Tristram, and it ceased of Sir</a>
<a id='line_21130'>Launcelot; and therefore Sir Launcelot’s brethren and his kinsmen would</a>
<a id='line_21131'>have slain Sir Tristram because of his fame. But when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_21132'>wist how his kinsmen were set, he said to them openly: Wit you well,</a>
<a id='line_21133'>that an the envy of you all be so hardy to wait upon my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_21134'>Tristram, with any hurt, shame, or villainy, as I am true knight I</a>
<a id='line_21135'>shall slay the best of you with mine own hands. Alas, fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_21136'>should ye for his noble deeds await upon him to slay him. Jesu defend,</a>
<a id='line_21137'>said Launcelot, that ever any noble knight as Sir Tristram is should be</a>
<a id='line_21138'>destroyed with treason. Of this noise and fame sprang into Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_21139'>and among them of Liones, whereof they were passing glad, and made</a>
<a id='line_21140'>great joy. And then they of Liones sent letters unto Sir Tristram of</a>
<a id='line_21141'>recommendation, and many great gifts to maintain Sir Tristram’s estate;</a>
<a id='line_21142'>and ever, between, Sir Tristram resorted unto Joyous Gard whereas La</a>

<a id='line_21157'>dolorous lady from her pain, and how that he fought with a dragon.</a>
<a id='line_21158'></a>
<a id='line_21159'></a>
<a id='line_21160'>Now leave we Sir Tristram de Liones, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_21161'>Lake, and of Sir Galahad, Sir Launcelot’s son, how he was gotten, and</a>
<a id='line_21162'>in what manner, as the book of French rehearseth. Afore the time that</a>
<a id='line_21163'>Sir Galahad was gotten or born, there came in an hermit unto King</a>
<a id='line_21164'>Arthur upon Whitsunday, as the knights sat at the Table Round. And when</a>
<a id='line_21165'>the hermit saw the Siege Perilous, he asked the king and all the</a>
<a id='line_21166'>knights why that siege was void. Sir Arthur and all the knights</a>
<a id='line_21167'>answered: There shall never none sit in that siege but one, but if he</a>
<a id='line_21168'>be destroyed. Then said the hermit: Wot ye what is he? Nay, said Arthur</a>
<a id='line_21169'>and all the knights, we wot not who is he that shall sit therein. Then</a>
<a id='line_21170'>wot I, said the hermit, for he that shall sit there is unborn and</a>
<a id='line_21171'>ungotten, and this same year he shall be gotten that shall sit there in</a>
<a id='line_21172'>that Siege Perilous, and he shall win the Sangreal. When this hermit</a>
<a id='line_21173'>had made this mention he departed from the court of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_21174'></a>
<a id='line_21175'>And then after this feast Sir Launcelot rode on his adventure, till on</a>
<a id='line_21176'>a time by adventure he passed over the pont of Corbin; and there he saw</a>
<a id='line_21177'>the fairest tower that ever he saw, and there-under was a fair town</a>
<a id='line_21178'>full of people; and all the people, men and women, cried at once:</a>
<a id='line_21179'>Welcome, Sir Launcelot du Lake, the flower of all knighthood, for by</a>
<a id='line_21180'>thee all we shall be holpen out of danger. What mean ye, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21181'>Launcelot, that ye cry so upon me? Ah, fair knight, said they all, here</a>
<a id='line_21182'>is within this tower a dolorous lady that hath been there in pains many</a>
<a id='line_21183'>winters and days, for ever she boileth in scalding water; and but late,</a>
<a id='line_21184'>said all the people, Sir Gawaine was here and he might not help her,</a>
<a id='line_21185'>and so he left her in pain. So may I, said Sir Launcelot, leave her in</a>
<a id='line_21186'>pain as well as Sir Gawaine did. Nay, said the people, we know well</a>
<a id='line_21187'>that it is Sir Launcelot that shall deliver her. Well, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_21188'>then shew me what I shall do.</a>
<a id='line_21189'></a>
<a id='line_21190'>Then they brought Sir Launcelot into the tower; and when he came to the</a>
<a id='line_21191'>chamber thereas this lady was, the doors of iron unlocked and unbolted.</a>
<a id='line_21192'>And so Sir Launcelot went into the chamber that was as hot as any stew.</a>
<a id='line_21193'>And there Sir Launcelot took the fairest lady by the hand that ever he</a>
<a id='line_21194'>saw, and she was naked as a needle; and by enchantment Queen Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_21195'>Fay and the Queen of Northgalis had put her there in that pains,</a>
<a id='line_21196'>because she was called the fairest lady of that country; and there she</a>
<a id='line_21197'>had been five years, and never might she be delivered out of her great</a>
<a id='line_21198'>pains unto the time the best knight of the world had taken her by the</a>
<a id='line_21199'>hand. Then the people brought her clothes. And when she was arrayed,</a>
<a id='line_21200'>Sir Launcelot thought she was the fairest lady of the world, but if it</a>
<a id='line_21201'>were Queen Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_21202'></a>
<a id='line_21203'>Then this lady said to Sir Launcelot: Sir, if it please you will ye go</a>
<a id='line_21204'>with me hereby into a chapel that we may give loving and thanking unto</a>
<a id='line_21205'>God? Madam, said Sir Launcelot, come on with me, I will go with you. So</a>
<a id='line_21206'>when they came there and gave thankings to God all the people, both</a>
<a id='line_21207'>learned and lewd, gave thankings unto God and him, and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_21208'>knight, since ye have delivered this lady, ye shall deliver us from a</a>
<a id='line_21209'>serpent there is here in a tomb. Then Sir Launcelot took his shield and</a>
<a id='line_21210'>said: Bring me thither, and what I may do unto the pleasure of God and</a>
<a id='line_21211'>you I will do. So when Sir Launcelot came thither he saw written upon</a>
<a id='line_21212'>the tomb letters of gold that said thus: Here shall come a leopard of</a>
<a id='line_21213'>king’s blood, and he shall slay this serpent, and this leopard shall</a>
<a id='line_21214'>engender a lion in this foreign country, the which lion shall pass all</a>
<a id='line_21215'>other knights. So then Sir Launcelot lift up the tomb, and there came</a>
<a id='line_21216'>out an horrible and a fiendly dragon, spitting fire out of his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_21217'>Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and fought with the dragon long, and</a>
<a id='line_21218'>at the last with great pain Sir Launcelot slew that dragon. Therewithal</a>
<a id='line_21219'>came King Pelles, the good and noble knight, and saluted Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_21220'>and he him again. Fair knight, said the king, what is your name? I</a>
<a id='line_21221'>require you of your knighthood tell me!</a>
<a id='line_21222'></a>
<a id='line_21223'></a>

<a id='line_21225'></a>
<a id='line_21226'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Launcelot came to Pelles, and of the Sangreal, and</a>
<a id='line_21227'>of Elaine, King Pelles’ daughter.</a>
<a id='line_21228'></a>
<a id='line_21229'></a>
<a id='line_21230'>Sir, said Launcelot, wit you well my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. And</a>
<a id='line_21231'>my name is, said the king, Pelles, king of the foreign country, and</a>
<a id='line_21232'>cousin nigh unto Joseph of Armathie. And then either of them made much</a>
<a id='line_21233'>of other, and so they went into the castle to take their repast. And</a>
<a id='line_21234'>anon there came in a dove at a window, and in her mouth there seemed a</a>
<a id='line_21235'>little censer of gold. And herewithal there was such a savour as all</a>
<a id='line_21236'>the spicery of the world had been there. And forthwithal there was upon</a>
<a id='line_21237'>the table all manner of meats and drinks that they could think upon. So</a>
<a id='line_21238'>came in a damosel passing fair and young, and she bare a vessel of gold</a>
<a id='line_21239'>betwixt her hands; and thereto the king kneeled devoutly, and said his</a>
<a id='line_21240'>prayers, and so did all that were there. O Jesu, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_21241'>what may this mean? This is, said the king, the richest thing that any</a>
<a id='line_21242'>man hath living. And when this thing goeth about, the Round Table shall</a>
<a id='line_21243'>be broken; and wit thou well, said the king, this is the holy Sangreal</a>
<a id='line_21244'>that ye have here seen. So the king and Sir Launcelot led their life</a>
<a id='line_21245'>the most part of that day. And fain would King Pelles have found the</a>
<a id='line_21246'>mean to have had Sir Launcelot to have lain by his daughter, fair</a>
<a id='line_21247'>Elaine. And for this intent: the king knew well that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_21248'>should get a child upon his daughter, the which should be named Sir</a>
<a id='line_21249'>Galahad the good knight, by whom all the foreign country should be</a>
<a id='line_21250'>brought out of danger, and by him the Holy Greal should be achieved.</a>
<a id='line_21251'></a>
<a id='line_21252'>Then came forth a lady that hight Dame Brisen, and she said unto the</a>
<a id='line_21253'>king: Sir, wit ye well Sir Launcelot loveth no lady in the world but</a>
<a id='line_21254'>all only Queen Guenever; and therefore work ye by counsel, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_21255'>make him to lie with your daughter, and he shall not wit but that he</a>
<a id='line_21256'>lieth with Queen Guenever. O fair lady, Dame Brisen, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_21257'>hope ye to bring this about? Sir, said she, upon pain of my life let me</a>
<a id='line_21258'>deal; for this Brisen was one of the greatest enchantresses that was at</a>
<a id='line_21259'>that time in the world living. Then anon by Dame Brisen’s wit she made</a>
<a id='line_21260'>one to come to Sir Launcelot that he knew well. And this man brought</a>
<a id='line_21261'>him a ring from Queen Guenever like as it had come from her, and such</a>
<a id='line_21262'>one as she was wont for the most part to wear; and when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_21263'>saw that token wit ye well he was never so fain. Where is my lady? said</a>
<a id='line_21264'>Sir Launcelot. In the Castle of Case, said the messenger, but five mile</a>
<a id='line_21265'>hence. Then Sir Launcelot thought to be there the same might. And then</a>
<a id='line_21266'>this Brisen by the commandment of King Pelles let send Elaine to this</a>
<a id='line_21267'>castle with twenty-five knights unto the Castle of Case. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_21268'>Launcelot against night rode unto that castle, and there anon he was</a>
<a id='line_21269'>received worshipfully with such people, to his seeming, as were about</a>
<a id='line_21270'>Queen Guenever secret.</a>
<a id='line_21271'></a>
<a id='line_21272'>So when Sir Launcelot was alighted, he asked where the queen was. So</a>
<a id='line_21273'>Dame Brisen said she was in her bed; and then the people were avoided,</a>
<a id='line_21274'>and Sir Launcelot was led unto his chamber. And then Dame Brisen</a>
<a id='line_21275'>brought Sir Launcelot a cup full of wine; and anon as he had drunken</a>
<a id='line_21276'>that wine he was so assotted and mad that he might make no delay, but</a>
<a id='line_21277'>withouten any let he went to bed; and he weened that maiden Elaine had</a>
<a id='line_21278'>been Queen Guenever. Wit you well that Sir Launcelot was glad, and so</a>
<a id='line_21279'>was that lady Elaine that she had gotten Sir Launcelot in her arms. For</a>
<a id='line_21280'>well she knew that same night should be gotten upon her Galahad that</a>
<a id='line_21281'>should prove the best knight of the world; and so they lay together</a>
<a id='line_21282'>until underne of the morn; and all the windows and holes of that</a>
<a id='line_21283'>chamber were stopped that no manner of day might be seen. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_21284'>Launcelot remembered him, and he arose up and went to the window.</a>
<a id='line_21285'></a>
<a id='line_21286'></a>
<a id='line_21287'></a>
<a id='line_21288'></a>
<a id='line_21289'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot was displeased when he knew that he had</a>
<a id='line_21290'>lain by Dame Elaine, and how she was delivered of Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_21291'></a>
<a id='line_21292'></a>
<a id='line_21293'>And anon as he had unshut the window the enchantment was gone; then he</a>
<a id='line_21294'>knew himself that he had done amiss. Alas, he said, that I have lived</a>
<a id='line_21295'>so long; now I am shamed. So then he gat his sword in his hand and</a>
<a id='line_21296'>said: Thou traitress, what art thou that I have lain by all this night?</a>
<a id='line_21297'>thou shalt die right here of my hands. Then this fair lady Elaine</a>
<a id='line_21298'>skipped out of her bed all naked, and kneeled down afore Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_21299'>and said: Fair courteous knight, come of king’s blood, I require you</a>
<a id='line_21300'>have mercy upon me, and as thou art renowned the most noble knight of</a>
<a id='line_21301'>the world, slay me not, for I have in my womb him by thee that shall be</a>
<a id='line_21302'>the most noblest knight of the world. Ah, false traitress, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21303'>Launcelot, why hast thou betrayed me? anon tell me what thou art. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_21304'>she said, I am Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21305'>Launcelot, I will forgive you this deed; and therewith he took her up</a>
<a id='line_21306'>in his arms, and kissed her, for she was as fair a lady, and thereto</a>
<a id='line_21307'>lusty and young, and as wise, as any was that time living. So God me</a>
<a id='line_21308'>help, said Sir Launcelot, I may not wite this to you; but her that made</a>
<a id='line_21309'>this enchantment upon me as between you and me, an I may find her, that</a>
<a id='line_21310'>same Lady Brisen, she shall lose her head for witchcrafts, for there</a>
<a id='line_21311'>was never knight deceived so as I am this night. And so Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_21312'>arrayed him, and armed him, and took his leave mildly at that lady</a>
<a id='line_21313'>young Elaine, and so he departed. Then she said: My lord Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_21314'>I beseech you see me as soon as ye may, for I have obeyed me unto the</a>
<a id='line_21315'>prophecy that my father told me. And by his commandment to fulfil this</a>
<a id='line_21316'>prophecy I have given the greatest riches and the fairest flower that</a>
<a id='line_21317'>ever I had, and that is my maidenhood that I shall never have again;</a>
<a id='line_21318'>and therefore, gentle knight, owe me your good will.</a>
<a id='line_21319'></a>
<a id='line_21320'>And so Sir Launcelot arrayed him and was armed, and took his leave</a>
<a id='line_21321'>mildly at that young lady Elaine; and so he departed, and rode till he</a>
<a id='line_21322'>came to the Castle of Corbin, where her father was. And as fast as her</a>
<a id='line_21323'>time came she was delivered of a fair child, and they christened him</a>
<a id='line_21324'>Galahad; and wit ye well that child was well kept and well nourished,</a>
<a id='line_21325'>and he was named Galahad because Sir Launcelot was so named at the</a>
<a id='line_21326'>fountain stone; and after that the Lady of the Lake confirmed him Sir</a>
<a id='line_21327'>Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_21328'></a>
<a id='line_21329'>Then after this lady was delivered and churched, there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_21330'>unto her, his name was Sir Bromel la Pleche, the which was a great</a>
<a id='line_21331'>lord; and he had loved that lady long, and he evermore desired her to</a>
<a id='line_21332'>wed her; and so by no mean she could put him off, till on a day she</a>
<a id='line_21333'>said to Sir Bromel: Wit thou well, sir knight, I will not love you, for</a>
<a id='line_21334'>my love is set upon the best knight of the world. Who is he? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21335'>Bromel. Sir, she said, it is Sir Launcelot du Lake that I love and none</a>
<a id='line_21336'>other, and therefore woo me no longer. Ye say well, said Sir Bromel,</a>
<a id='line_21337'>and sithen ye have told me so much, ye shall have but little joy of Sir</a>
<a id='line_21338'>Launcelot, for I shall slay him wheresomever I meet him. Sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_21339'>Lady Elaine, do to him no treason. Wit ye well, my lady, said Bromel,</a>
<a id='line_21340'>and I promise you this twelvemonth I shall keep the pont of Corbin for</a>
<a id='line_21341'>Sir Launcelot’s sake, that he shall neither come nor go unto you, but I</a>
<a id='line_21342'>shall meet with him.</a>
<a id='line_21343'></a>

<a id='line_21347'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Bors came to Dame Elaine and saw Galahad, and how</a>
<a id='line_21348'>he was fed with the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_21349'></a>
<a id='line_21350'></a>
<a id='line_21351'>Then as it fell by fortune and adventure, Sir Bors de Ganis, that was</a>
<a id='line_21352'>nephew unto Sir Launcelot, came over that bridge; and there Sir Bromel</a>
<a id='line_21353'>and Sir Bors jousted, and Sir Bors smote Sir Bromel such a buffet that</a>
<a id='line_21354'>he bare him over his horse’s croup. And then Sir Bromel, as an hardy</a>
<a id='line_21355'>knight, pulled out his sword, and dressed his shield to do battle with</a>
<a id='line_21356'>Sir Bors. And then Sir Bors alighted and avoided his horse, and there</a>
<a id='line_21357'>they dashed together many sad strokes; and long thus they fought, till</a>
<a id='line_21358'>at the last Sir Bromel was laid to the earth, and there Sir Bors began</a>
<a id='line_21359'>to unlace his helm to slay him. Then Sir Bromel cried Sir Bors mercy,</a>
<a id='line_21360'>and yielded him. Upon this covenant thou shalt have thy life, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21361'>Bors, so thou go unto Sir Launcelot upon Whitsunday that next cometh,</a>
<a id='line_21362'>and yield thee unto him as knight recreant. I will do it, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21363'>Bromel, and that he sware upon the cross of the sword. And so he let</a>
<a id='line_21364'>him depart, and Sir Bors rode unto King Pelles, that was within Corbin.</a>
<a id='line_21365'></a>
<a id='line_21366'>And when the king and Elaine his daughter wist that Sir Bors was nephew</a>
<a id='line_21367'>unto Sir Launcelot, they made him great cheer. Then said Dame Elaine:</a>
<a id='line_21368'>We marvel where Sir Launcelot is, for he came never here but once.</a>
<a id='line_21369'>Marvel not, said Sir Bors, for this half year he hath been in prison</a>
<a id='line_21370'>with Queen Morgan le Fay, King Arthur’s sister. Alas, said Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_21371'>that me repenteth. And ever Sir Bors beheld that child in her arms, and</a>
<a id='line_21372'>ever him seemed it was passing like Sir Launcelot. Truly, said Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_21373'>wit ye well this child he gat upon me. Then Sir Bors wept for joy, and</a>
<a id='line_21374'>he prayed to God it might prove as good a knight as his father was. And</a>
<a id='line_21375'>so came in a white dove, and she bare a little censer of gold in her</a>
<a id='line_21376'>mouth, and there was all manner of meats and drinks; and a maiden bare</a>
<a id='line_21377'>that Sangreal, and she said openly: Wit you well, Sir Bors, that this</a>
<a id='line_21378'>child is Galahad, that shall sit in the Siege Perilous, and achieve the</a>
<a id='line_21379'>Sangreal, and he shall be much better than ever was Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_21380'>Lake, that is his own father. And then they kneeled down and made their</a>
<a id='line_21381'>devotions, and there was such a savour as all the spicery in the world</a>
<a id='line_21382'>had been there. And when the dove took her flight, the maiden vanished</a>
<a id='line_21383'>with the Sangreal as she came.</a>
<a id='line_21384'></a>
<a id='line_21385'>Sir, said Sir Bors unto King Pelles, this castle may be named the</a>
<a id='line_21386'>Castle Adventurous, for here be many strange adventures. That is sooth,</a>
<a id='line_21387'>said the king, for well may this place be called the adventures place,</a>
<a id='line_21388'>for there come but few knights here that go away with any worship; be</a>
<a id='line_21389'>he never so strong, here he may be proved; and but late Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_21390'>the good knight, gat but little worship here. For I let you wit, said</a>
<a id='line_21391'>King Pelles, here shall no knight win no worship but if he be of</a>
<a id='line_21392'>worship himself and of good living, and that loveth God and dreadeth</a>
<a id='line_21393'>God, and else he getteth no worship here, be he never so hardy. That is</a>
<a id='line_21394'>wonderful thing, said Sir Bors. What ye mean in this country I wot not,</a>
<a id='line_21395'>for ye have many strange adventures, and therefore I will lie in this</a>
<a id='line_21396'>castle this night. Ye shall not do so, said King Pelles, by my counsel,</a>
<a id='line_21397'>for it is hard an ye escape without a shame. I shall take the adventure</a>
<a id='line_21398'>that will befall me, said Sir Bors. Then I counsel you, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_21399'>to be confessed clean. As for that, said Sir Bors, I will be shriven</a>
<a id='line_21400'>with a good will. So Sir Bors was confessed, and for all women Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_21401'>was a virgin, save for one, that was the daughter of King Brangoris,</a>
<a id='line_21402'>and on her he gat a child that hight Elaine, and save for her Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_21403'>was a clean maiden.</a>
<a id='line_21404'></a>
<a id='line_21405'>And so Sir Bors was led unto bed in a fair large chamber, and many</a>
<a id='line_21406'>doors were shut about the chamber. When Sir Bors espied all those</a>
<a id='line_21407'>doors, he avoided all the people, for he might have nobody with him;</a>
<a id='line_21408'>but in no wise Sir Bors would unarm him, but so he laid him down upon</a>
<a id='line_21409'>the bed. And right so he saw come in a light, that he might well see a</a>
<a id='line_21410'>spear great and long that came straight upon him pointling, and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_21411'>Bors seemed that the head of the spear brent like a taper. And anon, or</a>
<a id='line_21412'>Sir Bors wist, the spear head smote him into the shoulder an</a>
<a id='line_21413'>hand-breadth in deepness, and that wound grieved Sir Bors passing sore.</a>
<a id='line_21414'>And then he laid him down again for pain; and anon therewithal there</a>
<a id='line_21415'>came a knight armed with his shield on his shoulder and his sword in</a>
<a id='line_21416'>his hand, and he bade Sir Bors: Arise, sir knight, and fight with me. I</a>
<a id='line_21417'>am sore hurt, he said, but yet I shall not fail thee. And then Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_21418'>started up and dressed his shield; and then they lashed together</a>
<a id='line_21419'>mightily a great while; and at the last Sir Bors bare him backward</a>
<a id='line_21420'>until that he came unto a chamber door, and there that knight yede into</a>
<a id='line_21421'>that chamber and rested him a great while. And when he had reposed him</a>
<a id='line_21422'>he came out freshly again, and began new battle with Sir Bors mightily</a>
<a id='line_21423'>and strongly.</a>
<a id='line_21424'></a>

<a id='line_21429'>marvellous adventures that he had, and how he achieved them.</a>
<a id='line_21430'></a>
<a id='line_21431'></a>
<a id='line_21432'>Then Sir Bors thought he should no more go into that chamber to rest</a>
<a id='line_21433'>him, and so Sir Bors dressed him betwixt the knight and that chamber</a>
<a id='line_21434'>door, and there Sir Bors smote him down, and then that knight yielded</a>
<a id='line_21435'>him. What is your name? said Sir Bors. Sir, said he, my name is</a>
<a id='line_21436'>Pedivere of the Straight Marches. So Sir Bors made him to swear at</a>
<a id='line_21437'>Whitsunday next coming to be at the court of King Arthur, and yield him</a>
<a id='line_21438'>there as a prisoner as an overcome knight by the hands of Sir Bors. So</a>
<a id='line_21439'>thus departed Sir Pedivere of the Straight Marches. And then Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_21440'>laid him down to rest, and then he heard and felt much noise in that</a>
<a id='line_21441'>chamber; and then Sir Bors espied that there came in, he wist not</a>
<a id='line_21442'>whether at the doors nor windows, shot of arrows and of quarrels so</a>
<a id='line_21443'>thick that he marvelled, and many fell upon him and hurt him in the</a>
<a id='line_21444'>bare places.</a>
<a id='line_21445'></a>
<a id='line_21446'>And then Sir Bors was ware where came in an hideous lion; so Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_21447'>dressed him unto the lion, and anon the lion bereft him his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_21448'>with his sword Sir Bors smote off the lion’s head. Right so Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_21449'>forthwithal saw a dragon in the court passing horrible, and there</a>
<a id='line_21450'>seemed letters of gold written in his forehead; and Sir Bors thought</a>
<a id='line_21451'>that the letters made a signification of King Arthur. Right so there</a>
<a id='line_21452'>came an horrible leopard and an old, and there they fought long, and</a>
<a id='line_21453'>did great battle together. And at the last the dragon spit out of his</a>
<a id='line_21454'>mouth as it had been an hundred dragons; and lightly all the small</a>
<a id='line_21455'>dragons slew the old dragon and tare him all to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_21456'></a>
<a id='line_21457'>Anon withal there came an old man into the hall, and he sat him down in</a>
<a id='line_21458'>a fair chair, and there seemed to be two adders about his neck; and</a>
<a id='line_21459'>then the old man had an harp, and there he sang an old song how Joseph</a>
<a id='line_21460'>of Armathie came into this land. Then when he had sung, the old man</a>
<a id='line_21461'>bade Sir Bors go from thence. For here shall ye have no more</a>
<a id='line_21462'>adventures; and full worshipfully have ye done, and better shall ye do</a>
<a id='line_21463'>hereafter. And then Sir Bors seemed that there came the whitest dove</a>
<a id='line_21464'>with a little golden censer in her mouth. And anon therewithal the</a>
<a id='line_21465'>tempest ceased and passed, that afore was marvellous to hear. So was</a>
<a id='line_21466'>all that court full of good savours. Then Sir Bors saw four children</a>
<a id='line_21467'>bearing four fair tapers, and an old man in the midst of the children</a>
<a id='line_21468'>with a censer in his own hand, and a spear in his other hand, and that</a>
<a id='line_21469'>spear was called the Spear of Vengeance.</a>
<a id='line_21470'></a>

<a id='line_21472'></a>
<a id='line_21473'></a>
<a id='line_21474'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Bors departed; and how Sir Launcelot was rebuked of</a>
<a id='line_21475'>Queen Guenever, and of his excuse.</a>
<a id='line_21476'></a>
<a id='line_21477'></a>
<a id='line_21478'>Now, said that old man to Sir Bors, go ye to your cousin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_21479'>Launcelot, and tell him of this adventure the which had been most</a>
<a id='line_21480'>convenient for him of all earthly knights; but sin is so foul in him he</a>
<a id='line_21481'>may not achieve such holy deeds, for had not been his sin he had passed</a>
<a id='line_21482'>all the knights that ever were in his days; and tell thou Sir</a>
<a id='line_21483'>Launcelot, of all worldly adventures he passeth in manhood and prowess</a>
<a id='line_21484'>all other, but in this spiritual matters he shall have many his better.</a>
<a id='line_21485'>And then Sir Bors saw four gentlewomen come by him, purely beseen: and</a>
<a id='line_21486'>he saw where that they entered into a chamber where was great light as</a>
<a id='line_21487'>it were a summer light; and the women kneeled down afore an altar of</a>
<a id='line_21488'>silver with four pillars, and as it had been a bishop kneeled down</a>
<a id='line_21489'>afore that table of silver. And as Sir Bors looked over his head he saw</a>
<a id='line_21490'>a sword like silver, naked, hoving over his head, and the clearness</a>
<a id='line_21491'>thereof smote so in his eyes that as at that time Sir Bors was blind;</a>
<a id='line_21492'>and there he heard a voice that said: Go hence, thou Sir Bors, for as</a>
<a id='line_21493'>yet thou art not worthy for to be in this place. And then he yede</a>
<a id='line_21494'>backward to his bed till on the morn. And on the morn King Pelles made</a>
<a id='line_21495'>great joy of Sir Bors; and then he departed and rode to Camelot, and</a>
<a id='line_21496'>there he found Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told him of the adventures</a>
<a id='line_21497'>that he had seen with King Pelles at Corbin.</a>
<a id='line_21498'></a>
<a id='line_21499'>So the noise sprang in Arthur’s court that Launcelot had gotten a child</a>
<a id='line_21500'>upon Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, wherefore Queen Guenever was</a>
<a id='line_21501'>wroth, and gave many rebukes to Sir Launcelot, and called him false</a>
<a id='line_21502'>knight. And then Sir Launcelot told the queen all, and how he was made</a>
<a id='line_21503'>to lie by her by enchantment in likeness of the queen. So the queen</a>
<a id='line_21504'>held Sir Launcelot excused. And as the book saith, King Arthur had been</a>
<a id='line_21505'>in France, and had made war upon the mighty King Claudas, and had won</a>
<a id='line_21506'>much of his lands. And when the king was come again he let cry a great</a>
<a id='line_21507'>feast, that all lords and ladies of all England should be there, but if</a>
<a id='line_21508'>it were such as were rebellious against him.</a>
<a id='line_21509'></a>
<a id='line_21510'></a>
<a id='line_21511'></a>
<a id='line_21512'></a>
<a id='line_21513'>CHAPTER VII. How Dame Elaine, Galahad’s mother, came in great estate</a>
<a id='line_21514'>unto Camelot, and how Sir Launcelot behaved him there.</a>
<a id='line_21515'></a>
<a id='line_21516'></a>
<a id='line_21517'>And when Dame Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, heard of this feast</a>
<a id='line_21518'>she went to her father and required him that he would give her leave to</a>
<a id='line_21519'>ride to that feast. The king answered: I will well ye go thither, but</a>
<a id='line_21520'>in any wise as ye love me and will have my blessing, that ye be well</a>
<a id='line_21521'>beseen in the richest wise; and look that ye spare not for no cost; ask</a>
<a id='line_21522'>and ye shall have all that you needeth. Then by the advice of Dame</a>
<a id='line_21523'>Brisen, her maiden, all thing was apparelled unto the purpose, that</a>
<a id='line_21524'>there was never no lady more richlier beseen. So she rode with twenty</a>
<a id='line_21525'>knights, and ten ladies, and gentlewomen, to the number of an hundred</a>
<a id='line_21526'>horses. And when she came to Camelot, King Arthur and Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_21527'>said, and all the knights, that Dame Elaine was the fairest and the</a>
<a id='line_21528'>best beseen lady that ever was seen in that court. And anon as King</a>
<a id='line_21529'>Arthur wist that she was come he met her and saluted her, and so did</a>
<a id='line_21530'>the most part of all the knights of the Round Table, both Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_21531'>Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Gawaine, and many more that I will not rehearse.</a>
<a id='line_21532'>But when Sir Launcelot saw her he was so ashamed, and that because he</a>
<a id='line_21533'>drew his sword on the morn when he had lain by her, that he would not</a>
<a id='line_21534'>salute her nor speak to her; and yet Sir Launcelot thought she was the</a>
<a id='line_21535'>fairest woman that ever he saw in his life-days.</a>
<a id='line_21536'></a>
<a id='line_21537'>But when Dame Elaine saw Sir Launcelot that would not speak unto her</a>
<a id='line_21538'>she was so heavy that she weened her heart would have to-brast; for wit</a>
<a id='line_21539'>you well, out of measure she loved him. And then Elaine said unto her</a>
<a id='line_21540'>woman, Dame Brisen: the unkindness of Sir Launcelot slayeth me near.</a>
<a id='line_21541'>Ah, peace, madam, said Dame Brisen, I will undertake that this night he</a>
<a id='line_21542'>shall lie with you, an ye would hold you still. That were me liefer,</a>
<a id='line_21543'>said Dame Elaine, than all the gold that is above the earth. Let me</a>
<a id='line_21544'>deal, said Dame Brisen. So when Elaine was brought unto Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_21545'>either made other good cheer by countenance, but nothing with hearts.</a>
<a id='line_21546'>But all men and women spake of the beauty of Dame Elaine, and of her</a>
<a id='line_21547'>great riches.</a>
<a id='line_21548'></a>
<a id='line_21549'>Then, at night, the queen commanded that Dame Elaine should sleep in a</a>
<a id='line_21550'>chamber nigh her chamber, and all under one roof; and so it was done as</a>
<a id='line_21551'>the queen commanded. Then the queen sent for Sir Launcelot and bade him</a>
<a id='line_21552'>come to her chamber that night: Or else I am sure, said the queen, that</a>
<a id='line_21553'>ye will go to your lady’s bed, Dame Elaine, by whom ye gat Galahad. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_21554'>madam, said Sir Launcelot, never say ye so, for that I did was against</a>
<a id='line_21555'>my will. Then, said the queen, look that ye come to me when I send for</a>
<a id='line_21556'>you. Madam, said Launcelot, I shall not fail you, but I shall be ready</a>
<a id='line_21557'>at your commandment. This bargain was soon done and made between them,</a>
<a id='line_21558'>but Dame Brisen knew it by her crafts, and told it to her lady, Dame</a>
<a id='line_21559'>Elaine. Alas, said she, how shall I do? Let me deal, said Dame Brisen,</a>
<a id='line_21560'>for I shall bring him by the hand even to your bed, and he shall ween</a>
<a id='line_21561'>that I am Queen Guenever’s messenger. Now well is me, said Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_21562'>for all the world I love not so much as I do Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_21563'></a>

<a id='line_21567'>CHAPTER VIII. How Dame Brisen by enchantment brought Sir Launcelot to</a>
<a id='line_21568'>Dame Elaine’s bed, and how Queen Guenever rebuked him.</a>
<a id='line_21569'></a>
<a id='line_21570'></a>
<a id='line_21571'>So when time came that all folks were abed, Dame Brisen came to Sir</a>
<a id='line_21572'>Launcelot’s bed’s side and said: Sir Launcelot du Lake, sleep you? My</a>
<a id='line_21573'>lady, Queen Guenever, lieth and awaiteth upon you. O my fair lady, said</a>
<a id='line_21574'>Sir Launcelot, I am ready to go with you where ye will have me. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_21575'>Launcelot threw upon him a long gown, and his sword in his hand; and</a>
<a id='line_21576'>then Dame Brisen took him by the finger and led him to her lady’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_21577'>Dame Elaine; and then she departed and left them in bed together. Wit</a>
<a id='line_21578'>you well the lady was glad, and so was Sir Launcelot, for he weened</a>
<a id='line_21579'>that he had had another in his arms.</a>
<a id='line_21580'></a>
<a id='line_21581'>Now leave we them kissing and clipping, as was kindly thing; and now</a>
<a id='line_21582'>speak we of Queen Guenever that sent one of her women unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_21583'>Launcelot’s bed; and when she came there she found the bed cold, and he</a>
<a id='line_21584'>was away; so she came to the queen and told her all. Alas, said the</a>
<a id='line_21585'>queen, where is that false knight become? Then the queen was nigh out</a>
<a id='line_21586'>of her wit, and then she writhed and weltered as a mad woman, and might</a>
<a id='line_21587'>not sleep a four or five hours. Then Sir Launcelot had a condition that</a>
<a id='line_21588'>he used of custom, he would clatter in his sleep, and speak oft of his</a>
<a id='line_21589'>lady, Queen Guenever. So as Sir Launcelot had waked as long as it had</a>
<a id='line_21590'>pleased him, then by course of kind he slept, and Dame Elaine both. And</a>
<a id='line_21591'>in his sleep he talked and clattered as a jay, of the love that had</a>
<a id='line_21592'>been betwixt Queen Guenever and him. And so as he talked so loud the</a>
<a id='line_21593'>queen heard him thereas she lay in her chamber; and when she heard him</a>
<a id='line_21594'>so clatter she was nigh wood and out of her mind, and for anger and</a>
<a id='line_21595'>pain wist not what to do. And then she coughed so loud that Sir</a>
<a id='line_21596'>Launcelot awaked, and he knew her hemming. And then he knew well that</a>
<a id='line_21597'>he lay not by the queen; and therewith he leapt out of his bed as he</a>
<a id='line_21598'>had been a wood man, in his shirt, and the queen met him in the floor;</a>
<a id='line_21599'>and thus she said: False traitor knight that thou art, look thou never</a>
<a id='line_21600'>abide in my court, and avoid my chamber, and not so hardy, thou false</a>
<a id='line_21601'>traitor knight that thou art, that ever thou come in my sight. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_21602'>said Sir Launcelot; and therewith he took such an heartly sorrow at her</a>
<a id='line_21603'>words that he fell down to the floor in a swoon. And therewithal Queen</a>
<a id='line_21604'>Guenever departed. And when Sir Launcelot awoke of his swoon, he leapt</a>
<a id='line_21605'>out at a bay window into a garden, and there with thorns he was all</a>
<a id='line_21606'>to-scratched in his visage and his body; and so he ran forth he wist</a>
<a id='line_21607'>not whither, and was wild wood as ever was man; and so he ran two year,</a>
<a id='line_21608'>and never man might have grace to know him.</a>

<a id='line_21615'></a>
<a id='line_21616'></a>
<a id='line_21617'>Now turn we unto Queen Guenever and to the fair Lady Elaine, that when</a>
<a id='line_21618'>Dame Elaine heard the queen so to rebuke Sir Launcelot, and also she</a>
<a id='line_21619'>saw how he swooned, and how he leaped out at a bay window, then she</a>
<a id='line_21620'>said unto Queen Guenever: Madam, ye are greatly to blame for Sir</a>
<a id='line_21621'>Launcelot, for now have ye lost him, for I saw and heard by his</a>
<a id='line_21622'>countenance that he is mad for ever. Alas, madam, ye do great sin, and</a>
<a id='line_21623'>to yourself great dishonour, for ye have a lord of your own, and</a>
<a id='line_21624'>therefore it is your part to love him; for there is no queen in this</a>
<a id='line_21625'>world hath such another king as ye have. And, if ye were not, I might</a>
<a id='line_21626'>have the love of my lord Sir Launcelot; and cause I have to love him</a>
<a id='line_21627'>for he had my maidenhood, and by him I have borne a fair son, and his</a>
<a id='line_21628'>name is Galahad, and he shall be in his time the best knight of the</a>
<a id='line_21629'>world. Dame Elaine, said the queen, when it is daylight I charge you</a>
<a id='line_21630'>and command you to avoid my court; and for the love ye owe unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_21631'>Launcelot discover not his counsel, for an ye do, it will be his death.</a>
<a id='line_21632'>As for that, said Dame Elaine, I dare undertake he is marred for ever,</a>
<a id='line_21633'>and that have ye made; for ye, nor I, are like to rejoice him; for he</a>
<a id='line_21634'>made the most piteous groans when he leapt out at yonder bay window</a>
<a id='line_21635'>that ever I heard man make. Alas, said fair Elaine, and alas, said the</a>
<a id='line_21636'>Queen Guenever, for now I wot well we have lost him for ever.</a>
<a id='line_21637'></a>
<a id='line_21638'>So on the morn Dame Elaine took her leave to depart, and she would no</a>
<a id='line_21639'>longer abide. Then King Arthur brought her on her way with mo than an</a>
<a id='line_21640'>hundred knights through a forest. And by the way she told Sir Bors de</a>
<a id='line_21641'>Ganis all how it betid that same night, and how Sir Launcelot leapt out</a>
<a id='line_21642'>at a window, araged out of his wit. Alas, said Sir Bors, where is my</a>
<a id='line_21643'>lord, Sir Launcelot, become? Sir, said Elaine, I wot ne’er. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_21644'>Sir Bors, betwixt you both ye have destroyed that good knight. As for</a>
<a id='line_21645'>me, said Dame Elaine, I said never nor did never thing that should in</a>
<a id='line_21646'>any wise displease him, but with the rebuke that Queen Guenever gave</a>
<a id='line_21647'>him I saw him swoon to the earth; and when he awoke he took his sword</a>
<a id='line_21648'>in his hand, naked save his shirt, and leapt out at a window with the</a>
<a id='line_21649'>grisliest groan that ever I heard man make. Now farewell, Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_21650'>said Sir Bors, and hold my lord Arthur with a tale as long as ye can,</a>
<a id='line_21651'>for I will turn again to Queen Guenever and give her a hete; and I</a>
<a id='line_21652'>require you, as ever ye will have my service, make good watch and espy</a>
<a id='line_21653'>if ever ye may see my lord Sir Launcelot. Truly, said fair Elaine, I</a>
<a id='line_21654'>shall do all that I may do, for as fain would I know and wit where he</a>
<a id='line_21655'>is become, as you, or any of his kin, or Queen Guenever; and cause</a>
<a id='line_21656'>great enough have I thereto as well as any other. And wit ye well, said</a>
<a id='line_21657'>fair Elaine to Sir Bors, I would lose my life for him rather than he</a>
<a id='line_21658'>should be hurt; but alas, I cast me never for to see him, and the chief</a>
<a id='line_21659'>causer of this is Dame Guenever. Madam, said Dame Brisen, the which had</a>
<a id='line_21660'>made the enchantment before betwixt Sir Launcelot and her, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_21661'>heartily, let Sir Bors depart, and hie him with all his might as fast</a>
<a id='line_21662'>as he may to seek Sir Launcelot, for I warn you he is clean out of his</a>
<a id='line_21663'>mind; and yet he shall be well holpen an but by miracle.</a>
<a id='line_21664'></a>
<a id='line_21665'>Then wept Dame Elaine, and so did Sir Bors de Ganis; and so they</a>
<a id='line_21666'>departed, and Sir Bors rode straight unto Queen Guenever. And when she</a>
<a id='line_21667'>saw Sir Bors she wept as she were wood. Fie on your weeping, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21668'>Bors de Ganis, for ye weep never but when there is no bote. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_21669'>Sir Bors, that ever Sir Launcelot’s kin saw you, for now have ye lost</a>
<a id='line_21670'>the best knight of our blood, and he that was all our leader and our</a>
<a id='line_21671'>succour; and I dare say and make it good that all kings, christian nor</a>
<a id='line_21672'>heathen, may not find such a knight, for to speak of his nobleness and</a>
<a id='line_21673'>courtesy, with his beauty and his gentleness. Alas, said Sir Bors, what</a>
<a id='line_21674'>shall we do that be of his blood? Alas, said Sir Ector de Maris. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_21675'>said Lionel.</a>

<a id='line_21680'>CHAPTER X. What sorrow Queen Guenever made for Sir Launcelot, and how</a>
<a id='line_21681'>he was sought by knights of his kin.</a>
<a id='line_21682'></a>
<a id='line_21683'></a>
<a id='line_21684'>And when the queen heard them say so she fell to the earth in a dead</a>
<a id='line_21685'>swoon. And then Sir Bors took her up, and dawed her; and when she was</a>
<a id='line_21686'>awaked she kneeled afore the three knights, and held up both her hands,</a>
<a id='line_21687'>and besought them to seek him. And spare not for no goods but that he</a>
<a id='line_21688'>be found, for I wot he is out of his mind. And Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and</a>
<a id='line_21689'>Sir Lionel departed from the queen, for they might not abide no longer</a>
<a id='line_21690'>for sorrow. And then the queen sent them treasure enough for their</a>
<a id='line_21691'>expenses, and so they took their horses and their armour, and departed.</a>
<a id='line_21692'>And then they rode from country to country, in forests, and in</a>
<a id='line_21693'>wilderness, and in wastes; and ever they laid watch both at forests and</a>
<a id='line_21694'>at all manner of men as they rode, to hearken and spere after him, as</a>
<a id='line_21695'>he that was a naked man, in his shirt, with a sword in his hand. And</a>
<a id='line_21696'>thus they rode nigh a quarter of a year, endlong and overthwart, in</a>
<a id='line_21697'>many places, forests and wilderness, and oft-times were evil lodged for</a>
<a id='line_21698'>his sake; and yet for all their labour and seeking could they never</a>
<a id='line_21699'>hear word of him. And wit you well these three knights were passing</a>
<a id='line_21700'>sorry.</a>
<a id='line_21701'></a>
<a id='line_21702'>Then at the last Sir Bors and his fellows met with a knight that hight</a>
<a id='line_21703'>Sir Melion de Tartare. Now fair knight, said Sir Bors, whither be ye</a>
<a id='line_21704'>away? for they knew either other afore time. Sir, said Melion, I am in</a>
<a id='line_21705'>the way toward the court of King Arthur. Then we pray you, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21706'>Bors, that ye will tell my lord Arthur, and my lady, Queen Guenever,</a>
<a id='line_21707'>and all the fellowship of the Round Table, that we cannot in no wise</a>
<a id='line_21708'>hear tell where Sir Launcelot is become. Then Sir Melion departed from</a>
<a id='line_21709'>them, and said that he would tell the king, and the queen, and all the</a>
<a id='line_21710'>fellowship of the Round Table, as they had desired him. So when Sir</a>
<a id='line_21711'>Melion came to the court of King Arthur he told the king, and the</a>
<a id='line_21712'>queen, and all the fellowship of the Round Table, what Sir Bors had</a>
<a id='line_21713'>said of Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_21714'>Desirous, Sir Aglovale, and Sir Percivale de Galis took upon them by</a>
<a id='line_21715'>the great desire of King Arthur, and in especial by the queen, to seek</a>
<a id='line_21716'>throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, to find Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_21717'>with them rode eighteen knights mo to bear them fellowship; and wit ye</a>
<a id='line_21718'>well, they lacked no manner of spending; and so were they three and</a>
<a id='line_21719'>twenty knights.</a>
<a id='line_21720'></a>
<a id='line_21721'>Now turn we to Sir Launcelot, and speak we of his care and woe, and</a>
<a id='line_21722'>what pain he there endured; for cold, hunger, and thirst, he had</a>
<a id='line_21723'>plenty. And thus as these noble knights rode together, they by one</a>
<a id='line_21724'>assent departed, and then they rode by two, by three, and by four, and</a>
<a id='line_21725'>by five, and ever they assigned where they should meet. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_21726'>Aglovale and Sir Percivale rode together unto their mother that was a</a>
<a id='line_21727'>queen in those days. And when she saw her two sons, for joy she wept</a>
<a id='line_21728'>tenderly. And then she said: Ah, my dear sons, when your father was</a>
<a id='line_21729'>slain he left me four sons, of the which now be twain slain. And for</a>
<a id='line_21730'>the death of my noble son, Sir Lamorak, shall my heart never be glad.</a>
<a id='line_21731'>And then she kneeled down upon her knees to-fore Aglovale and Sir</a>
<a id='line_21732'>Percivale, and besought them to abide at home with her. Ah, sweet</a>
<a id='line_21733'>mother, said Sir Percivale, we may not, for we be come of king’s blood</a>
<a id='line_21734'>of both parties, and therefore, mother, it is our kind to haunt arms</a>
<a id='line_21735'>and noble deeds. Alas, my sweet sons, then she said, for your sakes I</a>
<a id='line_21736'>shall lose my liking and lust, and then wind and weather I may not</a>
<a id='line_21737'>endure, what for the death of your father, King Pellinore, that was</a>
<a id='line_21738'>shamefully slain by the hands of Sir Gawaine, and his brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_21739'>Gaheris: and they slew him not manly but by treason. Ah, my dear sons,</a>
<a id='line_21740'>this is a piteous complaint for me of your father’s death, considering</a>
<a id='line_21741'>also the death of Sir Lamorak, that of knighthood had but few fellows.</a>
<a id='line_21742'>Now, my dear sons, have this in your mind. Then there was but weeping</a>
<a id='line_21743'>and sobbing in the court when they should depart, and she fell</a>
<a id='line_21744'>a-swooning in midst of the court.</a>

<a id='line_21749'>CHAPTER XI. How a servant of Sir Aglovale’s was slain, and what</a>
<a id='line_21750'>vengeance Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale did therefore.</a>
<a id='line_21751'></a>
<a id='line_21752'></a>
<a id='line_21753'>And when she was awaked she sent a squire after them with spending</a>
<a id='line_21754'>enough. And so when the squire had overtaken them, they would not</a>
<a id='line_21755'>suffer him to ride with them, but sent him home again to comfort their</a>
<a id='line_21756'>mother, praying her meekly of her blessing. And so this squire was</a>
<a id='line_21757'>benighted, and by misfortune he happened to come to a castle where</a>
<a id='line_21758'>dwelled a baron. And so when the squire was come into the castle, the</a>
<a id='line_21759'>lord asked him from whence he came, and whom he served. My lord, said</a>
<a id='line_21760'>the squire, I serve a good knight that is called Sir Aglovale: the</a>
<a id='line_21761'>squire said it to good intent, weening unto him to have been more</a>
<a id='line_21762'>forborne for Sir Aglovale’s sake, than he had said he had served the</a>
<a id='line_21763'>queen, Aglovale’s mother. Well, my fellow, said the lord of that</a>
<a id='line_21764'>castle, for Sir Aglovale’s sake thou shalt have evil lodging, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_21765'>Aglovale slew my brother, and therefore thou shalt die on part of</a>
<a id='line_21766'>payment. And then that lord commanded his men to have him away and slay</a>
<a id='line_21767'>him; and so they did, and so pulled him out of the castle, and there</a>
<a id='line_21768'>they slew him without mercy.</a>
<a id='line_21769'></a>
<a id='line_21770'>Right so on the morn came Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale riding by a</a>
<a id='line_21771'>churchyard, where men and women were busy, and beheld the dead squire,</a>
<a id='line_21772'>and they thought to bury him. What is there, said Sir Aglovale, that ye</a>
<a id='line_21773'>behold so fast? A good man stert forth and said: Fair knight, here</a>
<a id='line_21774'>lieth a squire slain shamefully this night. How was he slain, fair</a>
<a id='line_21775'>fellow? said Sir Aglovale. My fair sir, said the man, the lord of this</a>
<a id='line_21776'>castle lodged this squire this night; and because he said he was</a>
<a id='line_21777'>servant unto a good knight that is with King Arthur, his name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_21778'>Aglovale, therefore the lord commanded to slay him, and for this cause</a>
<a id='line_21779'>is he slain. Gramercy, said Sir Aglovale, and ye shall see his death</a>
<a id='line_21780'>revenged lightly; for I am that same knight for whom this squire was</a>
<a id='line_21781'>slain.</a>
<a id='line_21782'></a>
<a id='line_21783'>Then Sir Aglovale called unto him Sir Percivale, and bade him alight</a>
<a id='line_21784'>lightly; and so they alighted both, and betook their horses to their</a>
<a id='line_21785'>men, and so they yede on foot into the castle. And all so soon as they</a>
<a id='line_21786'>were within the castle gate Sir Aglovale bade the porter: Go thou unto</a>
<a id='line_21787'>thy lord and tell him that I am Sir Aglovale for whom this squire was</a>
<a id='line_21788'>slain this night. Anon the porter told this to his lord, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_21789'>Goodewin. Anon he armed him, and then he came into the court and said:</a>
<a id='line_21790'>Which of you is Sir Aglovale? Here I am, said Aglovale: for what cause</a>
<a id='line_21791'>slewest thou this night my mother’s squire? I slew him, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_21792'>Goodewin, because of thee, for thou slewest my brother, Sir Gawdelin.</a>
<a id='line_21793'>As for thy brother, said Sir Aglovale, I avow it I slew him, for he was</a>
<a id='line_21794'>a false knight and a betrayer of ladies and of good knights; and for</a>
<a id='line_21795'>the death of my squire thou shalt die. I defy thee, said Sir Goodewin.</a>
<a id='line_21796'>Then they lashed together as eagerly as it had been two lions, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_21797'>Percivale he fought with all the remnant that would fight. And within a</a>
<a id='line_21798'>while Sir Percivale had slain all that would withstand him; for Sir</a>
<a id='line_21799'>Percivale dealt so his strokes that were so rude that there durst no</a>
<a id='line_21800'>man abide him. And within a while Sir Aglovale had Sir Goodewin at the</a>
<a id='line_21801'>earth, and there he unlaced his helm, and struck off his head. And then</a>
<a id='line_21802'>they departed and took their horses; and then they let carry the dead</a>
<a id='line_21803'>squire unto a priory, and there they interred him.</a>
<a id='line_21804'></a>
<a id='line_21805'></a>

<a id='line_21807'></a>
<a id='line_21808'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Pervivale departed secretly from his brother, and</a>
<a id='line_21809'>how he loosed a knight bound with a chain, and of other doings.</a>
<a id='line_21810'></a>
<a id='line_21811'></a>
<a id='line_21812'>And when this was done they rode into many countries, ever inquiring</a>
<a id='line_21813'>after Sir Launcelot, but never they could hear of him; and at the last</a>
<a id='line_21814'>they came to a castle that hight Cardican, and there Sir Percivale and</a>
<a id='line_21815'>Sir Aglovale were lodged together. And privily about midnight Sir</a>
<a id='line_21816'>Percivale came to Aglovale’s squire and said: Arise and make thee</a>
<a id='line_21817'>ready, for ye and I will ride away secretly. Sir, said the squire, I</a>
<a id='line_21818'>would full fain ride with you where ye would have me, but an my lord,</a>
<a id='line_21819'>your brother, take me he will slay me. As for that care thou not, for I</a>
<a id='line_21820'>shall be thy warrant.</a>
<a id='line_21821'></a>
<a id='line_21822'>And so Sir Percivale rode till it was after noon, and then he came upon</a>
<a id='line_21823'>a bridge of stone, and there he found a knight that was bound with a</a>
<a id='line_21824'>chain fast about the waist unto a pillar of stone. O fair knight, said</a>
<a id='line_21825'>that bound knight, I require thee loose me of my bonds. What knight are</a>
<a id='line_21826'>ye, said Sir Percivale, and for what cause are ye so bound? Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_21827'>shall tell you, said that knight: I am a knight of the Table Round, and</a>
<a id='line_21828'>my name is Sir Persides; and thus by adventure I came this way, and</a>
<a id='line_21829'>here I lodged in this castle at the bridge foot, and therein dwelleth</a>
<a id='line_21830'>an uncourteous lady; and because she proffered me to be her paramour,</a>
<a id='line_21831'>and I refused her, she set her men upon me suddenly or ever I might</a>
<a id='line_21832'>come to my weapon; and thus they bound me, and here I wot well I shall</a>
<a id='line_21833'>die but if some man of worship break my bands. Be ye of good cheer,</a>
<a id='line_21834'>said Sir Percivale, and because ye are a knight of the Round Table as</a>
<a id='line_21835'>well as I, I trust to God to break your bands. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_21836'>Percivale pulled out his sword and struck at the chain with such a</a>
<a id='line_21837'>might that he cut a-two the chain, and through Sir Persides’ hauberk</a>
<a id='line_21838'>and hurt him a little. O Jesu, said Sir Persides, that was a mighty</a>
<a id='line_21839'>stroke as ever I felt one, for had not the chain been ye had slain me.</a>
<a id='line_21840'></a>
<a id='line_21841'>And therewithal Sir Persides saw a knight coming out of a castle all</a>
<a id='line_21842'>that ever he might fling. Beware, sir, said Sir Persides, yonder cometh</a>
<a id='line_21843'>a man that will have ado with you. Let him come, said Sir Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_21844'>And so he met with that knight in midst of the bridge; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_21845'>Percivale gave him such a buffet that he smote him quite from his horse</a>
<a id='line_21846'>and over a part of the bridge, that, had not been a little vessel under</a>
<a id='line_21847'>the bridge, that knight had been drowned. And then Sir Percivale took</a>
<a id='line_21848'>the knight’s horse and made Sir Persides to mount up him; and so they</a>
<a id='line_21849'>rode unto the castle, and bade the lady deliver Sir Persides’ servants,</a>
<a id='line_21850'>or else he would slay all that ever he found; and so for fear she</a>
<a id='line_21851'>delivered them all. Then was Sir Percivale ware of a lady that stood in</a>
<a id='line_21852'>that tower. Ah, madam, said Sir Percivale, what use and custom is that</a>
<a id='line_21853'>in a lady to destroy good knights but if they will be your paramour?</a>
<a id='line_21854'>Forsooth this is a shameful custom of a lady, and if I had not a great</a>
<a id='line_21855'>matter in my hand I should fordo your evil customs.</a>
<a id='line_21856'></a>
<a id='line_21857'>And so Sir Persides brought Sir Percivale unto his own castle, and</a>
<a id='line_21858'>there he made him great cheer all that night. And on the morn, when Sir</a>
<a id='line_21859'>Percivale had heard mass and broken his fast, he bade Sir Persides ride</a>
<a id='line_21860'>unto King Arthur: And tell the king how that ye met with me; and tell</a>
<a id='line_21861'>my brother, Sir Aglovale, how I rescued you; and bid him seek not after</a>
<a id='line_21862'>me, for I am in the quest to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, and though he</a>
<a id='line_21863'>seek me he shall not find me; and tell him I will never see him, nor</a>
<a id='line_21864'>the court, till I have found Sir Launcelot. Also tell Sir Kay the</a>
<a id='line_21865'>Seneschal, and to Sir Mordred, that I trust to Jesu to be of as great</a>
<a id='line_21866'>worthiness as either of them, for tell them I shall never forget their</a>
<a id='line_21867'>mocks and scorns that they did to me that day that I was made knight;</a>
<a id='line_21868'>and tell them I will never see that court till men speak more worship</a>
<a id='line_21869'>of me than ever men did of any of them both. And so Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_21870'>departed from Sir Percivale, and then he rode unto King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_21871'>told there of Sir Percivale. And when Sir Aglovale heard him speak of</a>
<a id='line_21872'>his brother Sir Percivale, he said: He departed from me unkindly.</a>
<a id='line_21873'></a>

<a id='line_21877'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Percivale met with Sir Ector, and how they fought</a>
<a id='line_21878'>long, and each had almost slain other.</a>
<a id='line_21879'></a>
<a id='line_21880'></a>
<a id='line_21881'>Sir, said Sir Persides, on my life he shall prove a noble knight as any</a>
<a id='line_21882'>now is living. And when he saw Sir Kay and Sir Mordred, Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_21883'>said thus: My fair lords both, Sir Percivale greeteth you well both,</a>
<a id='line_21884'>and he sent you word by me that he trusteth to God or ever he come to</a>
<a id='line_21885'>the court again to be of as great noblesse as ever were ye both, and mo</a>
<a id='line_21886'>men to speak of his noblesse than ever they did of you. It may well be,</a>
<a id='line_21887'>said Sir Kay and Sir Mordred, but at that time when he was made knight</a>
<a id='line_21888'>he was full unlike to prove a good knight. As for that, said King</a>
<a id='line_21889'>Arthur, he must needs prove a good knight, for his father and his</a>
<a id='line_21890'>brethren were noble knights.</a>
<a id='line_21891'></a>
<a id='line_21892'>And now will we turn unto Sir Percivale that rode long; and in a forest</a>
<a id='line_21893'>he met a knight with a broken shield and a broken helm; and as soon as</a>
<a id='line_21894'>either saw other readily they made them ready to joust, and so hurtled</a>
<a id='line_21895'>together with all the might of their horses, and met together so hard,</a>
<a id='line_21896'>that Sir Percivale was smitten to the earth. And then Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_21897'>arose lightly, and cast his shield on his shoulder and drew his sword,</a>
<a id='line_21898'>and bade the other knight: Alight, and do we battle unto the uttermost.</a>
<a id='line_21899'>Will ye more? said that knight. And therewith he alighted, and put his</a>
<a id='line_21900'>horse from him; and then they came together an easy pace, and there</a>
<a id='line_21901'>they lashed together with noble swords, and sometime they struck and</a>
<a id='line_21902'>sometime they foined, and either gave other many great wounds. Thus</a>
<a id='line_21903'>they fought near half a day, and never rested but right little, and</a>
<a id='line_21904'>there was none of them both that had less wounds than fifteen, and they</a>
<a id='line_21905'>bled so much that it was marvel they stood on their feet. But this</a>
<a id='line_21906'>knight that fought with Sir Percivale was a proved knight and a</a>
<a id='line_21907'>wise-fighting knight, and Sir Percivale was young and strong, not</a>
<a id='line_21908'>knowing in fighting as the other was.</a>
<a id='line_21909'></a>
<a id='line_21910'>Then Sir Percivale spoke first, and said: Sir knight, hold thy hand a</a>
<a id='line_21911'>while still, for we have fought for a simple matter and quarrel</a>
<a id='line_21912'>overlong, and therefore I require thee tell me thy name, for I was</a>
<a id='line_21913'>never or this time matched. So God me help, said that knight, and never</a>
<a id='line_21914'>or this time was there never knight that wounded me so sore as thou</a>
<a id='line_21915'>hast done, and yet have I fought in many battles; and now shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_21916'>wit that I am a knight of the Table Round, and my name is Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_21917'>Maris, brother unto the good knight, Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_21918'>Sir Percivale, and my name is Sir Percivale de Galis that hath made my</a>
<a id='line_21919'>quest to seek Sir Launcelot, and now I am siker that I shall never</a>
<a id='line_21920'>finish my quest, for ye have slain me with your hands. It is not so,</a>
<a id='line_21921'>said Sir Ector, for I am slain by your hands, and may not live.</a>
<a id='line_21922'>Therefore I require you, said Sir Ector unto Sir Percivale, ride ye</a>
<a id='line_21923'>hereby to a priory, and bring me a priest that I may receive my</a>
<a id='line_21924'>Saviour, for I may not live. And when ye come to the court of King</a>
<a id='line_21925'>Arthur tell not my brother, Sir Launcelot, how that ye slew me, for</a>
<a id='line_21926'>then he would be your mortal enemy, but ye may say that I was slain in</a>
<a id='line_21927'>my quest as I sought him. Alas, said Sir Percivale, ye say that never</a>
<a id='line_21928'>will be, for I am so faint for bleeding that I may unnethe stand, how</a>
<a id='line_21929'>should I then take my horse?</a>

<a id='line_21936'></a>
<a id='line_21937'></a>
<a id='line_21938'>Then they made both great dole out of measure. This will not avail,</a>
<a id='line_21939'>said Sir Percivale. And then he kneeled down and made his prayer</a>
<a id='line_21940'>devoutly unto Almighty Jesu, for he was one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_21941'>world that at that time was, in whom the very faith stood most in.</a>
<a id='line_21942'>Right so there came by the holy vessel of the Sangreal with all manner</a>
<a id='line_21943'>of sweetness and savour; but they could not readily see who that bare</a>
<a id='line_21944'>that vessel, but Sir Percivale had a glimmering of the vessel and of</a>
<a id='line_21945'>the maiden that bare it, for he was a perfect clean maiden; and</a>
<a id='line_21946'>forthwithal they both were as whole of hide and limb as ever they were</a>
<a id='line_21947'>in their life-days: then they gave thankings to God with great</a>
<a id='line_21948'>mildness. O Jesu, said Sir Percivale, what may this mean, that we be</a>
<a id='line_21949'>thus healed, and right now we were at the point of dying? I wot full</a>
<a id='line_21950'>well, said Sir Ector, what it is; it is an holy vessel that is borne by</a>
<a id='line_21951'>a maiden, and therein is part of the holy blood of our Lord Jesu</a>
<a id='line_21952'>Christ, blessed mote he be. But it may not be seen, said Sir Ector, but</a>
<a id='line_21953'>if it be by a perfect man. So God me help, said Sir Percivale, I saw a</a>
<a id='line_21954'>damosel, as me thought, all in white, with a vessel in both her hands,</a>
<a id='line_21955'>and forthwithal I was whole.</a>
<a id='line_21956'></a>
<a id='line_21957'>So then they took their horses and their harness, and amended their</a>
<a id='line_21958'>harness as well as they might that was broken; and so they mounted upon</a>
<a id='line_21959'>their horses, and rode talking together. And there Sir Ector de Maris</a>
<a id='line_21960'>told Sir Percivale how he had sought his brother, Sir Launcelot, long,</a>
<a id='line_21961'>and never could hear witting of him: In many strange adventures have I</a>
<a id='line_21962'>been in this quest. And so either told other of their adventures.</a>

<a id='line_21975'>with a knight, and leapt in a bed.</a>
<a id='line_21976'></a>
<a id='line_21977'></a>
<a id='line_21978'>And now leave we of a while of Sir Ector and of Sir Percivale, and</a>
<a id='line_21979'>speak we of Sir Launcelot that suffered and endured many sharp showers,</a>
<a id='line_21980'>that ever ran wild wood from place to place, and lived by fruit and</a>
<a id='line_21981'>such as he might get, and drank water two year; and other clothing had</a>
<a id='line_21982'>he but little but his shirt and his breech. Thus as Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_21983'>wandered here and there he came in a fair meadow where he found a</a>
<a id='line_21984'>pavilion; and there by, upon a tree, there hung a white shield, and two</a>
<a id='line_21985'>swords hung thereby, and two spears leaned there by a tree. And when</a>
<a id='line_21986'>Sir Launcelot saw the swords, anon he leapt to the one sword, and took</a>
<a id='line_21987'>it in his hand, and drew it out. And then he lashed at the shield, that</a>
<a id='line_21988'>all the meadow rang of the dints, that he gave such a noise as ten</a>
<a id='line_21989'>knights had foughten together.</a>
<a id='line_21990'></a>
<a id='line_21991'>Then came forth a dwarf, and leapt unto Sir Launcelot, and would have</a>
<a id='line_21992'>had the sword out of his hand. And then Sir Launcelot took him by the</a>
<a id='line_21993'>both shoulders and threw him to the ground upon his neck, that he had</a>
<a id='line_21994'>almost broken his neck; and therewithal the dwarf cried help. Then came</a>
<a id='line_21995'>forth a likely knight, and well apparelled in scarlet furred with</a>
<a id='line_21996'>minever. And anon as he saw Sir Launcelot he deemed that he should be</a>
<a id='line_21997'>out of his wit. And then he said with fair speech: Good man, lay down</a>
<a id='line_21998'>that sword, for as meseemeth thou hadst more need of sleep and of warm</a>
<a id='line_21999'>clothes than to wield that sword. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, come</a>
<a id='line_22000'>not too nigh, for an thou do, wit thou well I will slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_22001'></a>
<a id='line_22002'>And when the knight of the pavilion saw that, he stert backward within</a>
<a id='line_22003'>the pavilion. And then the dwarf armed him lightly; and so the knight</a>
<a id='line_22004'>thought by force and might to take the sword from Sir Launcelot, and so</a>
<a id='line_22005'>he came stepping out; and when Sir Launcelot saw him come so all armed</a>
<a id='line_22006'>with his sword in his hand, then Sir Launcelot flew to him with such a</a>
<a id='line_22007'>might, and hit him upon the helm such a buffet, that the stroke</a>
<a id='line_22008'>troubled his brains, and therewith the sword brake in three. And the</a>
<a id='line_22009'>knight fell to the earth as he had been dead, the blood brasting out of</a>
<a id='line_22010'>his mouth, the nose, and the ears. And then Sir Launcelot ran into the</a>
<a id='line_22011'>pavilion, and rushed even into the warm bed; and there was a lady in</a>
<a id='line_22012'>that bed, and she gat her smock, and ran out of the pavilion. And when</a>
<a id='line_22013'>she saw her lord lie at the ground like to be dead, then she cried and</a>
<a id='line_22014'>wept as she had been mad. Then with her noise the knight awaked out of</a>
<a id='line_22015'>his swoon, and looked up weakly with his eyes; and then he asked her,</a>
<a id='line_22016'>where was that mad man that had given him such a buffet: For such a</a>
<a id='line_22017'>buffet had I never of man’s hand. Sir, said the dwarf, it is not</a>
<a id='line_22018'>worship to hurt him, for he is a man out of his wit; and doubt ye not</a>
<a id='line_22019'>he hath been a man of great worship, and for some heartly sorrow that</a>
<a id='line_22020'>he hath taken, he is fallen mad; and me beseemeth, said the dwarf, he</a>
<a id='line_22021'>resembleth much unto Sir Launcelot, for him I saw at the great</a>
<a id='line_22022'>tournament beside Lonazep. Jesu defend, said that knight, that ever</a>
<a id='line_22023'>that noble knight, Sir Launcelot, should be in such a plight; but</a>
<a id='line_22024'>whatsomever he be, said that knight, harm will I none do him: and this</a>
<a id='line_22025'>knight’s name was Bliant. Then he said unto the dwarf: Go thou fast on</a>
<a id='line_22026'>horseback, unto my brother Sir Selivant, that is at the Castle Blank,</a>
<a id='line_22027'>and tell him of mine adventure, and bid him bring with him an horse</a>
<a id='line_22028'>litter, and then will we bear this knight unto my castle.</a>
<a id='line_22029'></a>
<a id='line_22030'></a>

<a id='line_22032'></a>
<a id='line_22033'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Lancelot was carried in an horse litter, and how</a>
<a id='line_22034'>Sir Launcelot rescued Sir Bliant, his host.</a>
<a id='line_22035'></a>
<a id='line_22036'></a>
<a id='line_22037'>So the dwarf rode fast, and he came again and brought Sir Selivant with</a>
<a id='line_22038'>him, and six men with an horse litter; and so they took up the feather</a>
<a id='line_22039'>bed with Sir Launcelot, and so carried all away with them unto the</a>
<a id='line_22040'>Castle Blank, and he never awaked till he was within the castle. And</a>
<a id='line_22041'>then they bound his hands and his feet, and gave him good meats and</a>
<a id='line_22042'>good drinks, and brought him again to his strength and his fairness;</a>
<a id='line_22043'>but in his wit they could not bring him again, nor to know himself.</a>
<a id='line_22044'>Thus was Sir Launcelot there more than a year and a half, honestly</a>
<a id='line_22045'>arrayed and fair faren withal.</a>
<a id='line_22046'></a>
<a id='line_22047'>Then upon a day this lord of that castle, Sir Bliant, took his arms, on</a>
<a id='line_22048'>horseback, with a spear, to seek adventures. And as he rode in a forest</a>
<a id='line_22049'>there met with him two knights adventurous, the one was Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_22050'>Pité, and his brother, Sir Bertelot; and these two ran both at once</a>
<a id='line_22051'>upon Sir Bliant, and brake their spears upon his body. And then they</a>
<a id='line_22052'>drew out swords and made great battle, and fought long together. But at</a>
<a id='line_22053'>the last Sir Bliant was sore wounded, and felt himself faint; and then</a>
<a id='line_22054'>he fled on horseback toward his castle. And as they came hurling under</a>
<a id='line_22055'>the castle whereas Sir Launcelot lay in a window, [he] saw how two</a>
<a id='line_22056'>knights laid upon Sir Bliant with their swords. And when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22057'>saw that, yet as wood as he was he was sorry for his lord, Sir Bliant.</a>
<a id='line_22058'>And then Sir Launcelot brake the chains from his legs and off his arms,</a>
<a id='line_22059'>and in the breaking he hurt his hands sore; and so Sir Launcelot ran</a>
<a id='line_22060'>out at a postern, and there he met with the two knights that chased Sir</a>
<a id='line_22061'>Bliant; and there he pulled down Sir Bertelot with his bare hands from</a>
<a id='line_22062'>his horse, and therewithal he wrothe his sword out of his hand; and so</a>
<a id='line_22063'>he leapt unto Sir Breuse, and gave him such a buffet upon the head that</a>
<a id='line_22064'>he tumbled backward over his horse’s croup. And when Sir Bertelot saw</a>
<a id='line_22065'>there his brother have such a fall, he gat a spear in his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_22066'>would have run Sir Launcelot through: that saw Sir Bliant, and struck</a>
<a id='line_22067'>off the hand of Sir Bertelot. And then Sir Breuse and Sir Bertelot gat</a>
<a id='line_22068'>their horses and fled away.</a>
<a id='line_22069'></a>
<a id='line_22070'>When Sir Selivant came and saw what Sir Launcelot had done for his</a>
<a id='line_22071'>brother, then he thanked God, and so did his brother, that ever they</a>
<a id='line_22072'>did him any good. But when Sir Bliant saw that Sir Launcelot was hurt</a>
<a id='line_22073'>with the breaking of his irons, then was he heavy that ever he bound</a>
<a id='line_22074'>him. Bind him no more, said Sir Selivant, for he is happy and gracious.</a>
<a id='line_22075'>Then they made great joy of Sir Launcelot, and they bound him no more;</a>
<a id='line_22076'>and so he abode there an half year and more. And on the morn early Sir</a>
<a id='line_22077'>Launcelot was ware where came a great boar with many hounds nigh him.</a>
<a id='line_22078'>But the boar was so big there might no hounds tear him; and the hunters</a>
<a id='line_22079'>came after, blowing their horns, both upon horseback and some upon</a>
<a id='line_22080'>foot; and then Sir Launcelot was ware where one alighted and tied his</a>
<a id='line_22081'>horse to a tree, and leaned his spear against the tree.</a>
<a id='line_22082'></a>
<a id='line_22083'></a>
<a id='line_22084'></a>
<a id='line_22085'></a>
<a id='line_22086'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot fought against a boar and slew him, and</a>
<a id='line_22087'>how he was hurt, and brought unto an hermitage.</a>
<a id='line_22088'></a>
<a id='line_22089'></a>
<a id='line_22090'>So came Sir Launcelot and found the horse bounden till a tree, and a</a>
<a id='line_22091'>spear leaning against a tree, and a sword tied to the saddle bow; and</a>
<a id='line_22092'>then Sir Launcelot leapt into the saddle and gat that spear in his</a>
<a id='line_22093'>hand, and then he rode after the boar; and then Sir Launcelot was ware</a>
<a id='line_22094'>where the boar set his arse to a tree fast by an hermitage. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_22095'>Launcelot ran at the boar with his spear, and therewith the boar turned</a>
<a id='line_22096'>him nimbly, and rove out the lungs and the heart of the horse, so that</a>
<a id='line_22097'>Launcelot fell to the earth; and, or ever Sir Launcelot might get from</a>
<a id='line_22098'>the horse, the boar rove him on the brawn of the thigh up to the hough</a>
<a id='line_22099'>bone. And then Sir Launcelot was wroth, and up he gat upon his feet,</a>
<a id='line_22100'>and drew his sword, and he smote off the boar’s head at one stroke. And</a>
<a id='line_22101'>therewithal came out the hermit, and saw him have such a wound. Then</a>
<a id='line_22102'>the hermit came to Sir Launcelot and bemoaned him, and would have had</a>
<a id='line_22103'>him home unto his hermitage; but when Sir Launcelot heard him speak, he</a>
<a id='line_22104'>was so wroth with his wound that he ran upon the hermit to have slain</a>
<a id='line_22105'>him, and the hermit ran away. And when Sir Launcelot might not overget</a>
<a id='line_22106'>him, he threw his sword after him, for Sir Launcelot might go no</a>
<a id='line_22107'>further for bleeding; then the hermit turned again, and asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_22108'>Launcelot how he was hurt. Fellow, said Sir Launcelot, this boar hath</a>
<a id='line_22109'>bitten me sore. Then come with me, said the hermit, and I shall heal</a>
<a id='line_22110'>you. Go thy way, said Sir Launcelot, and deal not with me.</a>
<a id='line_22111'></a>
<a id='line_22112'>Then the hermit ran his way, and there he met with a good knight with</a>
<a id='line_22113'>many men. Sir, said the hermit, here is fast by my place the goodliest</a>
<a id='line_22114'>man that ever I saw, and he is sore wounded with a boar, and yet he</a>
<a id='line_22115'>hath slain the boar. But well I wot, said the hermit, and he be not</a>
<a id='line_22116'>holpen, that goodly man shall die of that wound, and that were great</a>
<a id='line_22117'>pity. Then that knight at the desire of the hermit gat a cart, and in</a>
<a id='line_22118'>that cart that knight put the boar and Sir Launcelot, for Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22119'>was so feeble that they might right easily deal with him; and so Sir</a>
<a id='line_22120'>Launcelot was brought unto the hermitage, and there the hermit healed</a>
<a id='line_22121'>him of his wound. But the hermit might not find Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_22122'>sustenance, and so he impaired and waxed feeble, both of his body and</a>
<a id='line_22123'>of his wit: for the default of his sustenance he waxed more wooder than</a>
<a id='line_22124'>he was aforehand.</a>
<a id='line_22125'></a>
<a id='line_22126'>And then upon a day Sir Launcelot ran his way into the forest; and by</a>
<a id='line_22127'>adventure he came to the city of Corbin, where Dame Elaine was, that</a>
<a id='line_22128'>bare Galahad, Sir Launcelot’s son. And so when he was entered into the</a>
<a id='line_22129'>town he ran through the town to the castle; and then all the young men</a>
<a id='line_22130'>of that city ran after Sir Launcelot, and there they threw turves at</a>
<a id='line_22131'>him, and gave him many sad strokes. And ever as Sir Launcelot might</a>
<a id='line_22132'>overreach any of them, he threw them so that they would never come in</a>
<a id='line_22133'>his hands no more; for of some he brake the legs and the arms, and so</a>
<a id='line_22134'>fled into the castle; and then came out knights and squires and rescued</a>
<a id='line_22135'>Sir Launcelot. And when they beheld him and looked upon his person,</a>
<a id='line_22136'>they thought they saw never so goodly a man. And when they saw so many</a>
<a id='line_22137'>wounds upon him, all they deemed that he had been a man of worship. And</a>
<a id='line_22138'>then they ordained him clothes to his body, and straw underneath him,</a>
<a id='line_22139'>and a little house. And then every day they would throw him meat, and</a>
<a id='line_22140'>set him drink, but there was but few would bring him meat to his hands.</a>
<a id='line_22141'></a>

<a id='line_22144'></a>
<a id='line_22145'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was known by Dame Elaine, and was borne</a>
<a id='line_22146'>into a chamber and after healed by the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_22147'></a>
<a id='line_22148'></a>
<a id='line_22149'>So it befell that King Pelles had a nephew, his name was Castor; and so</a>
<a id='line_22150'>he desired of the king to be made knight, and so at the request of this</a>
<a id='line_22151'>Castor the king made him knight at the feast of Candlemas. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_22152'>Castor was made knight, that same day he gave many gowns. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_22153'>Castor sent for the fool—that was Sir Launcelot. And when he was come</a>
<a id='line_22154'>afore Sir Castor, he gave Sir Launcelot a robe of scarlet and all that</a>
<a id='line_22155'>longed unto him. And when Sir Launcelot was so arrayed like a knight,</a>
<a id='line_22156'>he was the seemliest man in all the court, and none so well made. So</a>
<a id='line_22157'>when he saw his time he went into the garden, and there Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22158'>laid him down by a well and slept. And so at-after noon Dame Elaine and</a>
<a id='line_22159'>her maidens came into the garden to play them; and as they roamed up</a>
<a id='line_22160'>and down one of Dame Elaine’s maidens espied where lay a goodly man by</a>
<a id='line_22161'>the well sleeping, and anon showed him to Dame Elaine. Peace, said Dame</a>
<a id='line_22162'>Elaine, and say no word: and then she brought Dame Elaine where he lay.</a>
<a id='line_22163'>And when that she beheld him, anon she fell in remembrance of him, and</a>
<a id='line_22164'>knew him verily for Sir Launcelot; and therewithal she fell a-weeping</a>
<a id='line_22165'>so heartily that she sank even to the earth; and when she had thus wept</a>
<a id='line_22166'>a great while, then she arose and called her maidens and said she was</a>
<a id='line_22167'>sick.</a>
<a id='line_22168'></a>
<a id='line_22169'>And so she yede out of the garden, and she went straight to her father,</a>
<a id='line_22170'>and there she took him apart by herself; and then she said: O father,</a>
<a id='line_22171'>now have I need of your help, and but if that ye help me farewell my</a>
<a id='line_22172'>good days for ever. What is that, daughter? said King Pelles. Sir, she</a>
<a id='line_22173'>said, thus is it: in your garden I went for to sport, and there, by the</a>
<a id='line_22174'>well, I found Sir Launcelot du Lake sleeping. I may not believe that,</a>
<a id='line_22175'>said King Pelles. Sir, she said, truly he is there, and meseemeth he</a>
<a id='line_22176'>should be distract out of his wit. Then hold you still, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_22177'>and let me deal. Then the king called to him such as he most trusted, a</a>
<a id='line_22178'>four persons, and Dame Elaine, his daughter. And when they came to the</a>
<a id='line_22179'>well and beheld Sir Launcelot, anon Dame Brisen knew him. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_22180'>Dame Brisen, we must be wise how we deal with him, for this knight is</a>
<a id='line_22181'>out of his mind, and if we awake him rudely what he will do we all know</a>
<a id='line_22182'>not; but ye shall abide, and I shall throw such an enchantment upon him</a>
<a id='line_22183'>that he shall not awake within the space of an hour; and so she did.</a>
<a id='line_22184'></a>
<a id='line_22185'>Then within a little while after, the king commanded that all people</a>
<a id='line_22186'>should avoid, that none should be in that way thereas the king would</a>
<a id='line_22187'>come. And so when this was done, these four men and these ladies laid</a>
<a id='line_22188'>hand on Sir Launcelot, and so they bare him into a tower, and so into a</a>
<a id='line_22189'>chamber where was the holy vessel of the Sangreal, and by force Sir</a>
<a id='line_22190'>Launcelot was laid by that holy vessel; and there came an holy man and</a>
<a id='line_22191'>unhilled that vessel, and so by miracle and by virtue of that holy</a>
<a id='line_22192'>vessel Sir Launcelot was healed and recovered. And when that he was</a>
<a id='line_22193'>awaked he groaned and sighed, and complained greatly that he was</a>
<a id='line_22194'>passing sore.</a>
<a id='line_22195'></a>
<a id='line_22196'></a>

<a id='line_22199'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot, after that he was whole and had his mind,</a>
<a id='line_22200'>he was ashamed, and how that Elaine desired a castle for him.</a>
<a id='line_22201'></a>
<a id='line_22202'></a>
<a id='line_22203'>And when Sir Launcelot saw King Pelles and Elaine, he waxed ashamed and</a>
<a id='line_22204'>said thus: O Lord Jesu, how came I here? for God’s sake, my lord, let</a>
<a id='line_22205'>me wit how I came here. Sir, said Dame Elaine, into this country ye</a>
<a id='line_22206'>came like a madman, clean out of your wit, and here have ye been kept</a>
<a id='line_22207'>as a fool; and no creature here knew what ye were, until by fortune a</a>
<a id='line_22208'>maiden of mine brought me unto you whereas ye lay sleeping by a well,</a>
<a id='line_22209'>and anon as I verily beheld you I knew you. And then I told my father,</a>
<a id='line_22210'>and so were ye brought afore this holy vessel, and by the virtue of it</a>
<a id='line_22211'>thus were ye healed. O Jesu, mercy, said Sir Launcelot; if this be</a>
<a id='line_22212'>sooth, how many there be that know of my woodness! So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_22213'>Elaine, no more but my father, and I, and Dame Brisen. Now for Christ’s</a>
<a id='line_22214'>love, said Sir Launcelot, keep it in counsel, and let no man know it in</a>
<a id='line_22215'>the world, for I am sore ashamed that I have been thus miscarried; for</a>
<a id='line_22216'>I am banished out of the country of Logris for ever, that is for to say</a>
<a id='line_22217'>the country of England.</a>
<a id='line_22218'></a>
<a id='line_22219'>And so Sir Launcelot lay more than a fortnight or ever that he might</a>
<a id='line_22220'>stir for soreness. And then upon a day he said unto Dame Elaine these</a>
<a id='line_22221'>words: Lady Elaine, for your sake I have had much travail, care, and</a>
<a id='line_22222'>anguish, it needeth not to rehearse it, ye know how. Notwithstanding I</a>
<a id='line_22223'>know well I have done foul to you when that I drew my sword to you, to</a>
<a id='line_22224'>have slain you, upon the morn when I had lain with you. And all was the</a>
<a id='line_22225'>cause, that ye and Dame Brisen made me for to lie by you maugre mine</a>
<a id='line_22226'>head; and as ye say, that night Galahad your son was begotten. That is</a>
<a id='line_22227'>truth, said Dame Elaine. Now will ye for my love, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_22228'>go unto your father and get me a place of him wherein I may dwell? for</a>
<a id='line_22229'>in the court of King Arthur may I never come. Sir, said Dame Elaine, I</a>
<a id='line_22230'>will live and die with you, and only for your sake; and if my life</a>
<a id='line_22231'>might not avail you and my death might avail you, wit you well I would</a>
<a id='line_22232'>die for your sake. And I will go to my father and I am sure there is</a>
<a id='line_22233'>nothing that I can desire of him but I shall have it. And where ye be,</a>
<a id='line_22234'>my lord Sir Launcelot, doubt ye not but I will be with you with all the</a>
<a id='line_22235'>service that I may do. So forthwithal she went to her father and said,</a>
<a id='line_22236'>Sir, my lord, Sir Launcelot, desireth to be here by you in some castle</a>
<a id='line_22237'>of yours. Well daughter, said the king, sith it is his desire to abide</a>
<a id='line_22238'>in these marches he shall be in the Castle of Bliant, and there shall</a>
<a id='line_22239'>ye be with him, and twenty of the fairest ladies that be in the</a>
<a id='line_22240'>country, and they shall all be of the great blood, and ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_22241'>ten knights with you; for, daughter, I will that ye wit we all be</a>

<a id='line_22251'>Then went Dame Elaine unto Sir Launcelot, and told him all how her</a>

<a id='line_22254'>what was his name. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, my name is Le Chevaler Mal</a>

<a id='line_22259'>that it list me not to discover my name, what should it grieve you here</a>
<a id='line_22260'>to keep my counsel, and ye be not hurt thereby? but wit thou well an</a>
<a id='line_22261'>ever it lie in my power I shall grieve you, and that I promise you</a>
<a id='line_22262'>truly. Then Sir Castor kneeled down and besought Sir Launcelot of</a>
<a id='line_22263'>mercy: For I shall never utter what ye be, while that ye be in these</a>
<a id='line_22264'>parts. Then Sir Launcelot pardoned him.</a>
<a id='line_22265'></a>
<a id='line_22266'>And then, after this, King Pelles with ten knights, and Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_22267'>and twenty ladies, rode unto the Castle of Bliant that stood in an</a>
<a id='line_22268'>island beclosed in iron, with a fair water deep and large. And when</a>
<a id='line_22269'>they were there Sir Launcelot let call it the Joyous Isle; and there</a>
<a id='line_22270'>was he called none otherwise but Le Chevaler Mal Fet, the knight that</a>
<a id='line_22271'>hath trespassed. Then Sir Launcelot let make him a shield all of sable,</a>
<a id='line_22272'>and a queen crowned in the midst, all of silver, and a knight clean</a>
<a id='line_22273'>armed kneeling afore her. And every day once, for any mirths that all</a>
<a id='line_22274'>the ladies might make him, he would once every day look toward the</a>
<a id='line_22275'>realm of Logris, where King Arthur and Queen Guenever was. And then</a>
<a id='line_22276'>would he fall upon a weeping as his heart should to-brast.</a>
<a id='line_22277'></a>
<a id='line_22278'>So it fell that time Sir Launcelot heard of a jousting fast by his</a>
<a id='line_22279'>castle, within three leagues. Then he called unto him a dwarf, and he</a>
<a id='line_22280'>bade him go unto that jousting. And or ever the knights depart, look</a>
<a id='line_22281'>thou make there a cry, in hearing of all the knights, that there is one</a>
<a id='line_22282'>knight in the Joyous Isle, that is the Castle of Bliant, and say his</a>
<a id='line_22283'>name is Le Chevaler Mal Fet, that will joust against knights that will</a>
<a id='line_22284'>come. And who that putteth that knight to the worse shall have a fair</a>
<a id='line_22285'>maid and a gerfalcon.</a>
<a id='line_22286'></a>
<a id='line_22287'></a>
<a id='line_22288'></a>
<a id='line_22289'></a>
<a id='line_22290'>CHAPTER VII. Of a great tourneying in the Joyous Isle, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_22291'>Pervivale and Sir Ector came thither, and Sir Percivale fought with</a>
<a id='line_22292'>him.</a>
<a id='line_22293'></a>
<a id='line_22294'></a>
<a id='line_22295'>So when this cry was made, unto Joyous Isle drew knights to the number</a>
<a id='line_22296'>of five hundred; and wit ye well there was never seen in Arthur’s days</a>
<a id='line_22297'>one knight that did so much deeds of arms as Sir Launcelot did three</a>
<a id='line_22298'>days together; for as the book maketh truly mention, he had the better</a>
<a id='line_22299'>of all the five hundred knights, and there was not one slain of them.</a>
<a id='line_22300'>And after that Sir Launcelot made them all a great feast.</a>
<a id='line_22301'></a>
<a id='line_22302'>And in the meanwhile came Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Ector de Maris</a>
<a id='line_22303'>under that castle that was called the Joyous Isle. And as they beheld</a>
<a id='line_22304'>that gay castle they would have gone to that castle, but they might not</a>
<a id='line_22305'>for the broad water, and bridge could they find none. Then they saw on</a>
<a id='line_22306'>the other side a lady with a sperhawk on her hand, and Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_22307'>called unto her, and asked that lady who was in that castle. Fair</a>
<a id='line_22308'>knights, she said, here within this castle is the fairest lady in this</a>
<a id='line_22309'>land, and her name is Elaine. Also we have in this castle the fairest</a>
<a id='line_22310'>knight and the mightiest man that is I dare say living, and he called</a>
<a id='line_22311'>himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet. How came he into these marches? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22312'>Percivale. Truly, said the damosel, he came into this country like a</a>
<a id='line_22313'>mad man, with dogs and boys chasing him through the city of Corbin, and</a>
<a id='line_22314'>by the holy vessel of the Sangreal he was brought into his wit again;</a>
<a id='line_22315'>but he will not do battle with no knight, but by underne or by noon.</a>
<a id='line_22316'>And if ye list to come into the castle, said the lady, ye must ride</a>
<a id='line_22317'>unto the further side of the castle and there shall ye find a vessel</a>
<a id='line_22318'>that will bear you and your horse. Then they departed, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_22319'>the vessel. And then Sir Percivale alighted, and said to Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_22320'>Maris: Ye shall abide me here until that I wit what manner a knight he</a>
<a id='line_22321'>is; for it were shame unto us, inasmuch as he is but one knight, an we</a>
<a id='line_22322'>should both do battle with him. Do ye as ye list, said Sir Ector, and</a>
<a id='line_22323'>here I shall abide you until that I hear of you.</a>
<a id='line_22324'></a>
<a id='line_22325'>Then passed Sir Percivale the water, and when he came to the castle</a>
<a id='line_22326'>gate he bade the porter: Go thou to the good knight within the castle,</a>
<a id='line_22327'>and tell him here is come an errant knight to joust with him. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_22328'>the porter, ride ye within the castle, and there is a common place for</a>
<a id='line_22329'>jousting, that lords and ladies may behold you. So anon as Sir</a>
<a id='line_22330'>Launcelot had warning he was soon ready; and there Sir Percivale and</a>
<a id='line_22331'>Sir Launcelot encountered with such a might, and their spears were so</a>
<a id='line_22332'>rude, that both the horses and the knights fell to the earth. Then they</a>
<a id='line_22333'>avoided their horses, and flang out noble swords, and hewed away</a>
<a id='line_22334'>cantels of their shields, and hurtled together with their shields like</a>
<a id='line_22335'>two boars, and either wounded other passing sore. At the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_22336'>Percivale spake first when they had foughten there more than two hours.</a>
<a id='line_22337'>Fair knight, said Sir Percivale, I require thee tell me thy name, for I</a>
<a id='line_22338'>met never with such a knight. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, my name is Le</a>
<a id='line_22339'>Chevaler Mal Fet. Now tell me your name, said Sir Launcelot, I require</a>
<a id='line_22340'>you, gentle knight. Truly, said Sir Percivale, my name is Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_22341'>de Galis, that was brother unto the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis,</a>
<a id='line_22342'>and King Pellinore was our father, and Sir Aglovale is my brother.</a>
<a id='line_22343'>Alas, said Sir Launcelot, what have I done to fight with you that art a</a>
<a id='line_22344'>knight of the Round Table, that sometime was your fellow?</a>
<a id='line_22345'></a>
<a id='line_22346'></a>

<a id='line_22348'></a>
<a id='line_22349'>CHAPTER VIlI. How each of them knew other, and of their great courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_22350'>and how his brother Sir Ector came unto him, and of their joy.</a>
<a id='line_22351'></a>
<a id='line_22352'></a>
<a id='line_22353'>And therewithal Sir Launcelot kneeled down upon his knees, and threw</a>
<a id='line_22354'>away his shield and his sword from him. When Sir Percivale saw him do</a>
<a id='line_22355'>so he marvelled what he meant. And then thus he said: Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_22356'>whatsomever thou be, I require thee upon the high order of knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_22357'>tell me thy true name. Then he said: So God me help, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_22358'>Launcelot du Lake, King Ban’s son of Benoy. Alas, said Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_22359'>what have I done? I was sent by the queen for to seek you, and so I</a>
<a id='line_22360'>have sought you nigh this two year, and yonder is Sir Ector de Maris,</a>
<a id='line_22361'>your brother abideth me on the other side of the yonder water. Now for</a>
<a id='line_22362'>God’s sake, said Sir Percivale, forgive me mine offences that I have</a>
<a id='line_22363'>here done. It is soon forgiven, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_22364'></a>
<a id='line_22365'>Then Sir Percivale sent for Sir Ector de Maris, and when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22366'>had a sight of him, he ran unto him and took him in his arms; and then</a>
<a id='line_22367'>Sir Ector kneeled down, and either wept upon other, that all had pity</a>
<a id='line_22368'>to behold them. Then came Dame Elaine and she there made them great</a>
<a id='line_22369'>cheer as might lie in her power; and there she told Sir Ector and Sir</a>
<a id='line_22370'>Percivale how and in what manner Sir Launcelot came into that country,</a>
<a id='line_22371'>and how he was healed; and there it was known how long Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22372'>was with Sir Bliant and with Sir Selivant, and how he first met with</a>
<a id='line_22373'>them, and how he departed from them because of a boar; and how the</a>
<a id='line_22374'>hermit healed Sir Launcelot of his great wound, and how that he came to</a>
<a id='line_22375'>Corbin.</a>

<a id='line_22380'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Bors and Sir Lionel came to King Brandegore, and</a>
<a id='line_22381'>how Sir Bors took his son Helin le Blank, and of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_22382'></a>
<a id='line_22383'></a>
<a id='line_22384'>Now leave we Sir Launcelot in the Joyous Isle with the Lady Dame</a>
<a id='line_22385'>Elaine, and Sir Percivale and Sir Ector playing with them, and turn we</a>
<a id='line_22386'>to Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Lionel, that had sought Sir Launcelot nigh</a>
<a id='line_22387'>by the space of two year, and never could they hear of him. And as they</a>
<a id='line_22388'>thus rode, by adventure they came to the house of Brandegore, and there</a>
<a id='line_22389'>Sir Bors was well known, for he had gotten a child upon the king’s</a>
<a id='line_22390'>daughter fifteen year to-fore, and his name was Helin le Blank. And</a>
<a id='line_22391'>when Sir Bors saw that child it liked him passing well. And so those</a>
<a id='line_22392'>knights had good cheer of the King Brandegore. And on the morn Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_22393'>came afore King Brandegore and said: Here is my son Helin le Blank,</a>
<a id='line_22394'>that as it is said he is my son; and sith it is so, I will that ye wit</a>
<a id='line_22395'>that I will have him with me unto the court of King Arthur. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_22396'>the king, ye may well take him with you, but he is over tender of age.</a>
<a id='line_22397'>As for that, said Sir Bors, I will have him with me, and bring him to</a>
<a id='line_22398'>the house of most worship of the world. So when Sir Bors should depart</a>
<a id='line_22399'>there was made great sorrow for the departing of Helin le Blank, and</a>
<a id='line_22400'>great weeping was there made. But Sir Bors and Sir Lionel departed, and</a>
<a id='line_22401'>within a while they came to Camelot, where was King Arthur. And when</a>
<a id='line_22402'>King Arthur understood that Helin le Blank was Sir Bors’ son, and</a>
<a id='line_22403'>nephew unto King Brandegore, then King Arthur let him make knight of</a>
<a id='line_22404'>the Round Table; and so he proved a good knight and an adventurous.</a>
<a id='line_22405'></a>
<a id='line_22406'>Now will we turn to our matter of Sir Launcelot. It befell upon a day</a>
<a id='line_22407'>Sir Ector and Sir Percivale came to Sir Launcelot and asked him what he</a>
<a id='line_22408'>would do, and whether he would go with them unto King Arthur or not.</a>
<a id='line_22409'>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that may not be by no mean, for I was so</a>
<a id='line_22410'>entreated at the court that I cast me never to come there more. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_22411'>said Sir Ector, I am your brother, and ye are the man in the world that</a>
<a id='line_22412'>I love most; and if I understood that it were your disworship, ye may</a>
<a id='line_22413'>understand I would never counsel you thereto; but King Arthur and all</a>
<a id='line_22414'>his knights, and in especial Queen Guenever, made such dole and sorrow</a>
<a id='line_22415'>that it was marvel to hear and see. And ye must remember the great</a>
<a id='line_22416'>worship and renown that ye be of, how that ye have been more spoken of</a>
<a id='line_22417'>than any other knight that is now living; for there is none that</a>
<a id='line_22418'>beareth the name now but ye and Sir Tristram. Therefore brother, said</a>
<a id='line_22419'>Sir Ector, make you ready to ride to the court with us, and I dare say</a>
<a id='line_22420'>there was never knight better welcome to the court than ye; and I wot</a>
<a id='line_22421'>well and can make it good, said Sir Ector, it hath cost my lady, the</a>
<a id='line_22422'>queen, twenty thousand pound the seeking of you. Well brother, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22423'>Launcelot, I will do after your counsel, and ride with you.</a>
<a id='line_22424'></a>
<a id='line_22425'>So then they took their horses and made them ready, and took their</a>
<a id='line_22426'>leave at King Pelles and at Dame Elaine. And when Sir Launcelot should</a>
<a id='line_22427'>depart Dame Elaine made great sorrow. My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Dame</a>
<a id='line_22428'>Elaine, at this same feast of Pentecost shall your son and mine,</a>
<a id='line_22429'>Galahad, be made knight, for he is fully now fifteen winter old. Do as</a>
<a id='line_22430'>ye list, said Sir Launcelot; God give him grace to prove a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_22431'>As for that, said Dame Elaine, I doubt not he shall prove the best man</a>
<a id='line_22432'>of his kin except one. Then shall he be a man good enough, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22433'>Launcelot.</a>

<a id='line_22440'></a>
<a id='line_22441'></a>
<a id='line_22442'>Then they departed, and within five days’ journey they came to Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_22443'>that is called in English, Winchester. And when Sir Launcelot was come</a>
<a id='line_22444'>among them, the king and all the knights made great joy of him. And</a>
<a id='line_22445'>there Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Ector de Maris began and told the</a>
<a id='line_22446'>whole adventures: that Sir Launcelot had been out of his mind the time</a>
<a id='line_22447'>of his absence, and how he called himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet, the</a>
<a id='line_22448'>knight that had trespassed; and in three days Sir Launcelot smote down</a>
<a id='line_22449'>five hundred knights. And ever as Sir Ector and Sir Percivale told</a>
<a id='line_22450'>these tales of Sir Launcelot, Queen Guenever wept as she should have</a>
<a id='line_22451'>died. Then the queen made great cheer. O Jesu, said King Arthur, I</a>
<a id='line_22452'>marvel for what cause ye, Sir Launcelot, went out of your mind. I and</a>
<a id='line_22453'>many others deem it was for the love of fair Elaine, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_22454'>King Pelles, by whom ye are noised that ye have gotten a child, and his</a>
<a id='line_22455'>name is Galahad, and men say he shall do marvels. My lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22456'>Launcelot, if I did any folly I have that I sought. And therewithal the</a>
<a id='line_22457'>king spake no more. But all Sir Launcelot’s kin knew for whom he went</a>
<a id='line_22458'>out of his mind. And then there were great feasts made and great joy;</a>
<a id='line_22459'>and many great lords and ladies, when they heard that Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_22460'>come to the court again, they made great joy.</a>

<a id='line_22466'>court, to the great feast of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_22467'></a>
<a id='line_22468'></a>
<a id='line_22469'>Now will we leave off this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram, and of</a>
<a id='line_22470'>Sir Palomides that was the Saracen unchristened. When Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_22471'>come home unto Joyous Gard from his adventures, all this while that Sir</a>
<a id='line_22472'>Launcelot was thus missed, two year and more, Sir Tristram bare the</a>
<a id='line_22473'>renown through all the realm of Logris, and many strange adventures</a>
<a id='line_22474'>befell him, and full well and manly and worshipfully he brought them to</a>
<a id='line_22475'>an end. So when he was come home La Beale Isoud told him of the great</a>
<a id='line_22476'>feast that should be at Pentecost next following, and there she told</a>
<a id='line_22477'>him how Sir Launcelot had been missed two year, and all that while he</a>
<a id='line_22478'>had been out of his mind, and how he was holpen by the holy vessel, the</a>
<a id='line_22479'>Sangreal. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that caused some debate betwixt him</a>
<a id='line_22480'>and Queen Guenever. Sir, said Dame Isoud, I know it all, for Queen</a>
<a id='line_22481'>Guenever sent me a letter in the which she wrote me all how it was, for</a>
<a id='line_22482'>to require you to seek him. And now, blessed be God, said La Beale</a>
<a id='line_22483'>Isoud, he is whole and sound and come again to the court.</a>
<a id='line_22484'></a>
<a id='line_22485'>Thereof am I glad, said Sir Tristram, and now shall ye and I make us</a>
<a id='line_22486'>ready, for both ye and I will be at the feast. Sir, said Isoud, an it</a>
<a id='line_22487'>please you I will not be there, for through me ye be marked of many</a>
<a id='line_22488'>good knights, and that caused you to have much more labour for my sake</a>
<a id='line_22489'>than needeth you. Then will I not be there, said Sir Tristram, but if</a>
<a id='line_22490'>ye be there. God defend, said La Beale Isoud, for then shall I be</a>
<a id='line_22491'>spoken of shame among all queens and ladies of estate; for ye that are</a>
<a id='line_22492'>called one of the noblest knights of the world, and ye a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_22493'>Round Table, how may ye be missed at that feast? What shall be said</a>
<a id='line_22494'>among all knights? See how Sir Tristram hunteth, and hawketh, and</a>
<a id='line_22495'>cowereth within a castle with his lady, and forsaketh your worship.</a>
<a id='line_22496'>Alas, shall some say, it is pity that ever he was made knight, or that</a>
<a id='line_22497'>ever he should have the love of a lady. Also what shall queens and</a>
<a id='line_22498'>ladies say of me? It is pity that I have my life, that I will hold so</a>
<a id='line_22499'>noble a knight as ye are from his worship. So God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22500'>Tristram unto La Beale Isoud, it is passing well said of you and nobly</a>
<a id='line_22501'>counselled; and now I well understand that ye love me; and like as ye</a>
<a id='line_22502'>have counselled me I will do a part thereafter. But there shall no man</a>
<a id='line_22503'>nor child ride with me, but myself. And so will I ride on Tuesday next</a>
<a id='line_22504'>coming, and no more harness of war but my spear and my sword.</a>

<a id='line_22512'></a>
<a id='line_22513'></a>
<a id='line_22514'>And so when the day came Sir Tristram took his leave at La Beale Isoud,</a>
<a id='line_22515'>and she sent with him four knights, and within half a mile he sent them</a>
<a id='line_22516'>again: and within a mile after Sir Tristram saw afore him where Sir</a>
<a id='line_22517'>Palomides had stricken down a knight, and almost wounded him to the</a>
<a id='line_22518'>death. Then Sir Tristram repented him that he was not armed, and then</a>
<a id='line_22519'>he hoved still. With that Sir Palomides knew Sir Tristram, and cried on</a>
<a id='line_22520'>high: Sir Tristram, now be we met, for or we depart we will redress our</a>
<a id='line_22521'>old sores. As for that, said Sir Tristram, there was yet never</a>
<a id='line_22522'>Christian man might make his boast that ever I fled from him; and wit</a>
<a id='line_22523'>ye well, Sir Palomides, thou that art a Saracen shall never make thy</a>
<a id='line_22524'>boast that Sir Tristram de Liones shall flee from thee. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_22525'>Sir Tristram made his horse to run, and with all his might he came</a>
<a id='line_22526'>straight upon Sir Palomides, and brast his spear upon him an hundred</a>
<a id='line_22527'>pieces. And forthwithal Sir Tristram drew his sword. And then he turned</a>
<a id='line_22528'>his horse and struck at Palomides six great strokes upon his helm; and</a>
<a id='line_22529'>then Sir Palomides stood still, and beheld Sir Tristram, and marvelled</a>
<a id='line_22530'>of his woodness, and of his folly. And then Sir Palomides said to</a>
<a id='line_22531'>himself: An Sir Tristram were armed, it were hard to cease him of this</a>
<a id='line_22532'>battle, and if I turn again and slay him I am ashamed wheresomever that</a>
<a id='line_22533'>I go.</a>
<a id='line_22534'></a>
<a id='line_22535'>Then Sir Tristram spake and said: Thou coward knight, what castest thou</a>
<a id='line_22536'>to do; why wilt thou not do battle with me? for have thou no doubt I</a>
<a id='line_22537'>shall endure all thy malice. Ah, Sir Tristram, said Palomides, full</a>
<a id='line_22538'>well thou wottest I may not fight with thee for shame, for thou art</a>
<a id='line_22539'>here naked and I am armed, and if I slay thee, dishonour shall be mine.</a>
<a id='line_22540'>And well thou wottest, said Sir Palomides to Sir Tristram, I know thy</a>
<a id='line_22541'>strength and thy hardiness to endure against a good knight. That is</a>
<a id='line_22542'>truth, said Sir Tristram, I understand thy valiantness well. Ye say</a>
<a id='line_22543'>well, said Sir Palomides; now, I require you, tell me a question that I</a>
<a id='line_22544'>shall say to you. Tell me what it is, said Sir Tristram, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_22545'>answer you the truth, as God me help. I put case, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_22546'>that ye were armed at all rights as well as I am, and I naked as ye be,</a>
<a id='line_22547'>what would you do to me now, by your true knighthood? Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22548'>Tristram, now I understand thee well, Sir Palomides, for now must I say</a>
<a id='line_22549'>mine own judgment, and as God me bless, that I shall say shall not be</a>
<a id='line_22550'>said for no fear that I have of thee. But this is all: wit Sir</a>
<a id='line_22551'>Palomides, as at this time thou shouldest depart from me, for I would</a>
<a id='line_22552'>not have ado with thee. No more will I, said Palomides, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_22553'>ride forth on thy way. As for that I may choose, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_22554'>either to ride or to abide. But Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_22555'>marvel of one thing, that thou that art so good a knight, that thou</a>
<a id='line_22556'>wilt not be christened, and thy brother, Sir Safere, hath been</a>
<a id='line_22557'>christened many a day.</a>
<a id='line_22558'></a>
<a id='line_22559'></a>
<a id='line_22560'></a>
<a id='line_22561'></a>
<a id='line_22562'>CHAPTER XIII. How that Sir Tristram gat him harness of a knight which</a>
<a id='line_22563'>was hurt, and how he overthrew Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_22564'></a>
<a id='line_22565'></a>
<a id='line_22566'>As for that, said Sir Palomides, I may not yet be christened for one</a>
<a id='line_22567'>avow that I have made many years agone; howbeit in my heart I believe</a>
<a id='line_22568'>in Jesu Christ and his mild mother Mary; but I have but one battle to</a>
<a id='line_22569'>do, and when that is done I will be baptised with a good will. By my</a>
<a id='line_22570'>head, said Tristram, as for one battle thou shalt not seek it no</a>
<a id='line_22571'>longer. For God defend, said Sir Tristram, that through my default thou</a>
<a id='line_22572'>shouldst longer live thus a Saracen, for yonder is a knight that ye,</a>
<a id='line_22573'>Sir Palomides, have hurt and smitten down. Now help me that I were</a>
<a id='line_22574'>armed in his armour, and I shall soon fulfil thine avows. As ye will,</a>
<a id='line_22575'>said Palomides, so it shall be.</a>
<a id='line_22576'></a>
<a id='line_22577'>So they rode both unto that knight that sat upon a bank, and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_22578'>Tristram saluted him, and he weakly saluted him again. Sir knight, said</a>
<a id='line_22579'>Sir Tristram, I require you tell me your right name. Sir, he said, my</a>
<a id='line_22580'>name is Sir Galleron of Galway, and knight of the Table Round. So God</a>
<a id='line_22581'>me help, said Sir Tristram, I am right heavy of your hurts; but this is</a>
<a id='line_22582'>all, I must pray you to lend me all your whole armour, for ye see I am</a>
<a id='line_22583'>unarmed, and I must do battle with this knight. Sir, said the hurt</a>
<a id='line_22584'>knight, ye shall have it with a good will; but ye must beware, for I</a>
<a id='line_22585'>warn you that knight is wight. Sir, said Galleron, I pray you tell me</a>
<a id='line_22586'>your name, and what is that knight’s name that hath beaten me. Sir, as</a>
<a id='line_22587'>for my name it is Sir Tristram de Liones, and as for the knight’s name</a>
<a id='line_22588'>that hath hurt you is Sir Palomides, brother to the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_22589'>Safere, and yet is Sir Palomides unchristened. Alas, said Sir Galleron,</a>
<a id='line_22590'>that is pity that so good a knight and so noble a man of arms should be</a>
<a id='line_22591'>unchristened. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, either he shall slay</a>
<a id='line_22592'>me or I him but that he shall be christened or ever we depart</a>
<a id='line_22593'>in-sunder. My lord Sir Tristram, said Sir Galleron, your renown and</a>
<a id='line_22594'>worship is well known through many realms, and God save you this day</a>
<a id='line_22595'>from shenship and shame.</a>
<a id='line_22596'></a>
<a id='line_22597'>Then Sir Tristram unarmed Galleron, the which was a noble knight, and</a>
<a id='line_22598'>had done many deeds of arms, and he was a large knight of flesh and</a>
<a id='line_22599'>bone. And when he was unarmed he stood upon his feet, for he was</a>
<a id='line_22600'>bruised in the back with a spear; yet so as Sir Galleron might, he</a>
<a id='line_22601'>armed Sir Tristram. And then Sir Tristram mounted upon his own horse,</a>
<a id='line_22602'>and in his hand he gat Sir Galleron’s spear; and therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_22603'>Palomides was ready. And so they came hurtling together, and either</a>
<a id='line_22604'>smote other in midst of their shields; and therewithal Sir Palomides’</a>
<a id='line_22605'>spear brake, and Sir Tristram smote down the horse; and Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_22606'>as soon as he might, avoided his horse, and dressed his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_22607'>pulled out his sword. That saw Sir Tristram, and therewithal he</a>
<a id='line_22608'>alighted and tied his horse till a tree.</a>
<a id='line_22609'></a>
<a id='line_22610'></a>

<a id='line_22612'></a>
<a id='line_22613'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides fought long together,</a>
<a id='line_22614'>and after accorded, and how Sir Tristram made him to be christened.</a>
<a id='line_22615'></a>
<a id='line_22616'></a>
<a id='line_22617'>And then they came together as two wild boars, lashing together,</a>
<a id='line_22618'>tracing and traversing as noble men that oft had been well proved in</a>
<a id='line_22619'>battle; but ever Sir Palomides dread the might of Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_22620'>therefore he suffered him to breathe him. Thus they fought more than</a>
<a id='line_22621'>two hours, but often Sir Tristram smote such strokes at Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_22622'>that he made him to kneel; and Sir Palomides brake and cut away many</a>
<a id='line_22623'>pieces of Sir Tristram’s shield; and then Sir Palomides wounded Sir</a>
<a id='line_22624'>Tristram, for he was a well fighting man. Then Sir Tristram was wood</a>
<a id='line_22625'>wroth out of measure, and rushed upon Sir Palomides with such a might</a>
<a id='line_22626'>that Sir Palomides fell grovelling to the earth; and therewithal he</a>
<a id='line_22627'>leapt up lightly upon his feet, and then Sir Tristram wounded Palomides</a>
<a id='line_22628'>sore through the shoulder. And ever Sir Tristram fought still in like</a>
<a id='line_22629'>hard, and Sir Palomides failed not, but gave him many sad strokes. And</a>
<a id='line_22630'>at the last Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and by fortune Sir</a>
<a id='line_22631'>Tristram smote Sir Palomides sword out of his hand, and if Sir</a>
<a id='line_22632'>Palomides had stooped for his sword he had been slain.</a>
<a id='line_22633'></a>
<a id='line_22634'>Then Palomides stood still and beheld his sword with a sorrowful heart.</a>
<a id='line_22635'>How now, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, now have I thee at advantage</a>
<a id='line_22636'>as thou haddest me this day; but it shall never be said in no court,</a>
<a id='line_22637'>nor among good knights, that Sir Tristram shall slay any knight that is</a>
<a id='line_22638'>weaponless; and therefore take thou thy sword, and let us make an end</a>
<a id='line_22639'>of this battle. As for to do this battle, said Palomides, I dare right</a>
<a id='line_22640'>well end it, but I have no great lust to fight no more. And for this</a>
<a id='line_22641'>cause, said Palomides: mine offence to you is not so great but that we</a>
<a id='line_22642'>may be friends. All that I have offended is and was for the love of La</a>
<a id='line_22643'>Beale Isoud. And as for her, I dare say she is peerless above all other</a>
<a id='line_22644'>ladies, and also I proffered her never no dishonour; and by her I have</a>
<a id='line_22645'>gotten the most part of my worship. And sithen I offended never as to</a>
<a id='line_22646'>her own person, and as for the offence that I have done, it was against</a>
<a id='line_22647'>your own person, and for that offence ye have given me this day many</a>
<a id='line_22648'>sad strokes, and some I have given you again; and now I dare say I felt</a>
<a id='line_22649'>never man of your might, nor so well breathed, but if it were Sir</a>
<a id='line_22650'>Launcelot du Lake; wherefore I require you, my lord, forgive me all</a>
<a id='line_22651'>that I have offended unto you; and this same day have me to the next</a>
<a id='line_22652'>church, and first let me be clean confessed, and after see you now that</a>
<a id='line_22653'>I be truly baptised. And then will we all ride together unto the court</a>
<a id='line_22654'>of Arthur, that we be there at the high feast. Now take your horse,</a>
<a id='line_22655'>said Sir Tristram, and as ye say so it shall be, and all thine evil</a>
<a id='line_22656'>will God forgive it you, and I do. And here within this mile is the</a>
<a id='line_22657'>Suffragan of Carlisle that shall give you the sacrament of baptism.</a>
<a id='line_22658'></a>
<a id='line_22659'>Then they took their horses and Sir Galleron rode with them. And when</a>
<a id='line_22660'>they came to the Suffragan Sir Tristram told him their desire. Then the</a>
<a id='line_22661'>Suffragan let fill a great vessel with water, and when he had hallowed</a>
<a id='line_22662'>it he then confessed clean Sir Palomides, and Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_22663'>Galleron were his godfathers. And then soon after they departed, riding</a>
<a id='line_22664'>toward Camelot, where King Arthur and Queen Guenever was, and for the</a>
<a id='line_22665'>most part all the knights of the Round Table. And so the king and all</a>
<a id='line_22666'>the court were glad that Sir Palomides was christened. And at the same</a>
<a id='line_22667'>feast in came Galahad and sat in the Siege Perilous. And so therewithal</a>
<a id='line_22668'>departed and dissevered all the knights of the Round Table. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_22669'>Tristram returned again unto Joyous Gard, and Sir Palomides followed</a>
<a id='line_22670'>the Questing Beast.</a>

<a id='line_22693'></a>
<a id='line_22694'></a>
<a id='line_22695'>At the vigil of Pentecost, when all the fellowship of the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_22696'>were come unto Camelot and there heard their service, and the tables</a>
<a id='line_22697'>were set ready to the meat, right so entered into the hall a full fair</a>
<a id='line_22698'>gentlewoman on horseback, that had ridden full fast, for her horse was</a>
<a id='line_22699'>all besweated. Then she there alighted, and came before the king and</a>
<a id='line_22700'>saluted him; and he said: Damosel, God thee bless. Sir, said she, for</a>
<a id='line_22701'>God’s sake say me where Sir Launcelot is. Yonder ye may see him, said</a>
<a id='line_22702'>the king. Then she went unto Launcelot and said: Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_22703'>salute you on King Pelles’ behalf, and I require you come on with me</a>
<a id='line_22704'>hereby into a forest. Then Sir Launcelot asked her with whom she</a>
<a id='line_22705'>dwelled. I dwell, said she, with King Pelles. What will ye with me?</a>
<a id='line_22706'>said Launcelot. Ye shall know, said she, when ye come thither. Well,</a>
<a id='line_22707'>said he, I will gladly go with you. So Sir Launcelot bade his squire</a>
<a id='line_22708'>saddle his horse and bring his arms; and in all haste he did his</a>
<a id='line_22709'>commandment.</a>
<a id='line_22710'></a>
<a id='line_22711'>Then came the queen unto Launcelot, and said: Will ye leave us at this</a>
<a id='line_22712'>high feast? Madam, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well he shall be with</a>
<a id='line_22713'>you to-morn by dinner time. If I wist, said the queen, that he should</a>
<a id='line_22714'>not be with us here to-morn he should not go with you by my good will.</a>
<a id='line_22715'>Right so departed Sir Launcelot with the gentlewoman, and rode until</a>
<a id='line_22716'>that he came into a forest and into a great valley, where they saw an</a>
<a id='line_22717'>abbey of nuns; and there was a squire ready and opened the gates, and</a>
<a id='line_22718'>so they entered and descended off their horses; and there came a fair</a>
<a id='line_22719'>fellowship about Sir Launcelot, and welcomed him, and were passing glad</a>
<a id='line_22720'>of his coming. And then they led him unto the Abbess’s chamber and</a>
<a id='line_22721'>unarmed him; and right so he was ware upon a bed lying two of his</a>
<a id='line_22722'>cousins, Sir Bors and Sir Lionel, and then he waked them; and when they</a>
<a id='line_22723'>saw him they made great joy. Sir, said Sir Bors unto Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_22724'>what adventure hath brought you hither, for we weened to-morn to have</a>
<a id='line_22725'>found you at Camelot? As God me help, said Sir Launcelot, a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_22726'>brought me hither, but I know not the cause.</a>
<a id='line_22727'></a>
<a id='line_22728'>In the meanwhile that they thus stood talking together, therein came</a>
<a id='line_22729'>twelve nuns that brought with them Galahad, the which was passing fair</a>
<a id='line_22730'>and well made, that unnethe in the world men might not find his match:</a>
<a id='line_22731'>and all those ladies wept. Sir, said they all, we bring you here this</a>
<a id='line_22732'>child the which we have nourished, and we pray you to make him a</a>
<a id='line_22733'>knight, for of a more worthier man’s hand may he not receive the order</a>
<a id='line_22734'>of knighthood. Sir Launcelot beheld the young squire and saw him seemly</a>
<a id='line_22735'>and demure as a dove, with all manner of good features, that he weened</a>
<a id='line_22736'>of his age never to have seen so fair a man of form. Then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_22737'>Launcelot: Cometh this desire of himself? He and all they said yea.</a>
<a id='line_22738'>Then shall he, said Sir Launcelot, receive the high order of knighthood</a>
<a id='line_22739'>as to-morn at the reverence of the high feast. That night Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22740'>had passing good cheer; and on the morn at the hour of prime, at</a>
<a id='line_22741'>Galahad’s desire, he made him knight and said: God make him a good man,</a>
<a id='line_22742'>for of beauty faileth you not as any that liveth.</a>

<a id='line_22751'>Now fair sir, said Sir Launcelot, will ye come with me unto the court</a>
<a id='line_22752'>of King Arthur? Nay, said he, I will not go with you as at this time.</a>
<a id='line_22753'>Then he departed from them and took his two cousins with him, and so</a>
<a id='line_22754'>they came unto Camelot by the hour of underne on Whitsunday. By that</a>
<a id='line_22755'>time the king and the queen were gone to the minster to hear their</a>
<a id='line_22756'>service. Then the king and the queen were passing glad of Sir Bors and</a>
<a id='line_22757'>Sir Lionel, and so was all the fellowship. So when the king and all the</a>
<a id='line_22758'>knights were come from service, the barons espied in the sieges of the</a>
<a id='line_22759'>Round Table all about, written with golden letters: Here ought to sit</a>
<a id='line_22760'>he, and he ought to sit here. And thus they went so long till that they</a>
<a id='line_22761'>came to the Siege Perilous, where they found letters newly written of</a>
<a id='line_22762'>gold which said: Four hundred winters and four and fifty accomplished</a>
<a id='line_22763'>after the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ ought this siege to be</a>
<a id='line_22764'>fulfilled. Then all they said: This is a marvellous thing and an</a>
<a id='line_22765'>adventurous. In the name of God, said Sir Launcelot; and then accompted</a>
<a id='line_22766'>the term of the writing from the birth of our Lord unto that day. It</a>
<a id='line_22767'>seemeth me said Sir Launcelot, this siege ought to be fulfilled this</a>
<a id='line_22768'>same day, for this is the feast of Pentecost after the four hundred and</a>
<a id='line_22769'>four and fifty year; and if it would please all parties, I would none</a>
<a id='line_22770'>of these letters were seen this day, till he be come that ought to</a>
<a id='line_22771'>enchieve this adventure. Then made they to ordain a cloth of silk, for</a>
<a id='line_22772'>to cover these letters in the Siege Perilous.</a>
<a id='line_22773'></a>
<a id='line_22774'>Then the king bade haste unto dinner. Sir, said Sir Kay the Steward, if</a>
<a id='line_22775'>ye go now unto your meat ye shall break your old custom of your court,</a>
<a id='line_22776'>for ye have not used on this day to sit at your meat or that ye have</a>
<a id='line_22777'>seen some adventure. Ye say sooth, said the king, but I had so great</a>
<a id='line_22778'>joy of Sir Launcelot and of his cousins, which be come to the court</a>
<a id='line_22779'>whole and sound, so that I bethought me not of mine old custom. So, as</a>
<a id='line_22780'>they stood speaking, in came a squire and said unto the king: Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_22781'>bring unto you marvellous tidings. What be they? said the king. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_22782'>there is here beneath at the river a great stone which I saw fleet</a>
<a id='line_22783'>above the water, and therein I saw sticking a sword. The king said: I</a>
<a id='line_22784'>will see that marvel. So all the knights went with him, and when they</a>
<a id='line_22785'>came to the river they found there a stone fleeting, as it were of red</a>
<a id='line_22786'>marble, and therein stuck a fair rich sword, and in the pommel thereof</a>
<a id='line_22787'>were precious stones wrought with subtle letters of gold. Then the</a>
<a id='line_22788'>barons read the letters which said in this wise: Never shall man take</a>
<a id='line_22789'>me hence, but only he by whose side I ought to hang, and he shall be</a>
<a id='line_22790'>the best knight of the world.</a>
<a id='line_22791'></a>
<a id='line_22792'>When the king had seen the letters, he said unto Sir Launcelot: Fair</a>
<a id='line_22793'>Sir, this sword ought to be yours, for I am sure ye be the best knight</a>
<a id='line_22794'>of the world. Then Sir Launcelot answered full soberly: Certes, sir, it</a>
<a id='line_22795'>is not my sword; also, Sir, wit ye well I have no hardiness to set my</a>
<a id='line_22796'>hand to it, for it longed not to hang by my side. Also, who that</a>
<a id='line_22797'>assayeth to take the sword and faileth of it, he shall receive a wound</a>
<a id='line_22798'>by that sword that he shall not be whole long after. And I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_22799'>wit that this same day shall the adventures of the Sangreal, that is</a>
<a id='line_22800'>called the Holy Vessel, begin.</a>

<a id='line_22805'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Gawaine assayed to draw out the sword, and how an</a>
<a id='line_22806'>old man brought in Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_22807'></a>
<a id='line_22808'></a>
<a id='line_22809'>Now, fair nephew, said the king unto Sir Gawaine, assay ye, for my</a>
<a id='line_22810'>love. Sir, he said, save your good grace I shall not do that. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_22811'>the king, assay to take the sword and at my commandment. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_22812'>Gawaine, your commandment I will obey. And therewith he took up the</a>
<a id='line_22813'>sword by the handles, but he might not stir it. I thank you, said the</a>
<a id='line_22814'>king to Sir Gawaine. My lord Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, now wit</a>
<a id='line_22815'>ye well this sword shall touch you so sore that ye shall will ye had</a>
<a id='line_22816'>never set your hand thereto for the best castle of this realm. Sir, he</a>
<a id='line_22817'>said, I might not withsay mine uncle’s will and commandment. But when</a>
<a id='line_22818'>the king heard this he repented it much, and said unto Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_22819'>that he should assay, for his love. And he said: Gladly, for to bear</a>
<a id='line_22820'>Sir Gawaine fellowship. And therewith he set his hand on the sword and</a>
<a id='line_22821'>drew it strongly, but he might not move it. Then were there no more</a>
<a id='line_22822'>that durst be so hardy to set their hands thereto. Now may ye go to</a>
<a id='line_22823'>your dinner, said Sir Kay unto the king, for a marvellous adventure</a>
<a id='line_22824'>have ye seen. So the king and all went unto the court, and every knight</a>
<a id='line_22825'>knew his own place, and set him therein, and young men that were</a>
<a id='line_22826'>knights served them.</a>
<a id='line_22827'></a>
<a id='line_22828'>So when they were served, and all sieges fulfilled save only the Siege</a>
<a id='line_22829'>Perilous, anon there befell a marvellous adventure, that all the doors</a>
<a id='line_22830'>and windows of the palace shut by themself. Not for then the hall was</a>
<a id='line_22831'>not greatly darked; and therewith they were all abashed both one and</a>
<a id='line_22832'>other. Then King Arthur spake first and said: By God, fair fellows and</a>
<a id='line_22833'>lords, we have seen this day marvels, but or night I suppose we shall</a>
<a id='line_22834'>see greater marvels.</a>
<a id='line_22835'></a>
<a id='line_22836'>In the meanwhile came in a good old man, and an ancient, clothed all in</a>
<a id='line_22837'>white, and there was no knight knew from whence he came. And with him</a>
<a id='line_22838'>he brought a young knight, both on foot, in red arms, without sword or</a>
<a id='line_22839'>shield, save a scabbard hanging by his side. And these words he said:</a>
<a id='line_22840'>Peace be with you, fair lords. Then the old man said unto Arthur: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_22841'>I bring here a young knight, the which is of king’s lineage, and of the</a>
<a id='line_22842'>kindred of Joseph of Aramathie, whereby the marvels of this court, and</a>
<a id='line_22843'>of strange realms, shall be fully accomplished.</a>
<a id='line_22844'></a>
<a id='line_22845'></a>
<a id='line_22846'></a>
<a id='line_22847'></a>
<a id='line_22848'>CHAPTER IV. How the old man brought Galahad to the Siege Perilous and</a>
<a id='line_22849'>set him therein, and how all the knights marvelled.</a>
<a id='line_22850'></a>
<a id='line_22851'></a>
<a id='line_22852'>The king was right glad of his words, and said unto the good man: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_22853'>ye be right welcome, and the young knight with you. Then the old man</a>
<a id='line_22854'>made the young man to unarm him, and he was in a coat of red sendal,</a>
<a id='line_22855'>and bare a mantle upon his shoulder that was furred with ermine, and</a>
<a id='line_22856'>put that upon him. And the old knight said unto the young knight: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_22857'>follow me. And anon he led him unto the Siege Perilous, where beside</a>
<a id='line_22858'>sat Sir Launcelot; and the good man lift up the cloth, and found there</a>
<a id='line_22859'>letters that said thus: This is the siege of Galahad, the haut prince.</a>
<a id='line_22860'>Sir, said the old knight, wit ye well that place is yours. And then he</a>
<a id='line_22861'>set him down surely in that siege. And then he said to the old man:</a>
<a id='line_22862'>Sir, ye may now go your way, for well have ye done that ye were</a>
<a id='line_22863'>commanded to do; and recommend me unto my grandsire, King Pelles, and</a>
<a id='line_22864'>unto my lord Petchere, and say them on my behalf, I shall come and see</a>
<a id='line_22865'>them as soon as ever I may. So the good man departed; and there met him</a>
<a id='line_22866'>twenty noble squires, and so took their horses and went their way.</a>
<a id='line_22867'></a>
<a id='line_22868'>Then all the knights of the Table Round marvelled greatly of Sir</a>
<a id='line_22869'>Galahad, that he durst sit there in that Siege Perilous, and was so</a>
<a id='line_22870'>tender of age; and wist not from whence he came but all only by God;</a>
<a id='line_22871'>and said: This is he by whom the Sangreal shall be enchieved, for there</a>
<a id='line_22872'>sat never none but he, but he were mischieved. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_22873'>beheld his son and had great joy of him. Then Bors told his fellows:</a>
<a id='line_22874'>Upon pain of my life this young knight shall come unto great worship.</a>
<a id='line_22875'>This noise was great in all the court, so that it came to the queen.</a>
<a id='line_22876'>Then she had marvel what knight it might be that durst adventure him to</a>
<a id='line_22877'>sit in the Siege Perilous. Many said unto the queen he resembled much</a>
<a id='line_22878'>unto Sir Launcelot. I may well suppose, said the queen, that Sir</a>
<a id='line_22879'>Launcelot begat him on King Pelles’ daughter, by the which he was made</a>
<a id='line_22880'>to lie by, by enchantment, and his name is Galahad. I would fain see</a>
<a id='line_22881'>him, said the queen, for he must needs be a noble man, for so is his</a>
<a id='line_22882'>father that him begat, I report me unto all the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_22883'></a>
<a id='line_22884'>So when the meat was done that the king and all were risen, the king</a>
<a id='line_22885'>yede unto the Siege Perilous and lift up the cloth, and found there the</a>
<a id='line_22886'>name of Galahad; and then he shewed it unto Sir Gawaine, and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_22887'>nephew, now have we among us Sir Galahad, the good knight that shall</a>
<a id='line_22888'>worship us all; and upon pain of my life he shall enchieve the</a>
<a id='line_22889'>Sangreal, right as Sir Launcelot had done us to understand. Then came</a>
<a id='line_22890'>King Arthur unto Galahad and said: Sir, ye be welcome, for ye shall</a>
<a id='line_22891'>move many good knights to the quest of the Sangreal, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_22892'>enchieve that never knights might bring to an end. Then the king took</a>
<a id='line_22893'>him by the hand, and went down from the palace to shew Galahad the</a>
<a id='line_22894'>adventures of the stone.</a>
<a id='line_22895'></a>
<a id='line_22896'></a>
<a id='line_22897'></a>
<a id='line_22898'></a>
<a id='line_22899'>CHAPTER V. How King Arthur shewed the stone hoving on the water to</a>
<a id='line_22900'>Galahad, and how he drew out the sword.</a>
<a id='line_22901'></a>
<a id='line_22902'></a>
<a id='line_22903'>The queen heard thereof, and came after with many ladies, and shewed</a>
<a id='line_22904'>them the stone where it hoved on the water. Sir, said the king unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_22905'>Galahad, here is a great marvel as ever I saw, and right good knights</a>
<a id='line_22906'>have assayed and failed. Sir, said Galahad, that is no marvel, for this</a>
<a id='line_22907'>adventure is not theirs but mine; and for the surety of this sword I</a>
<a id='line_22908'>brought none with me, for here by my side hangeth the scabbard. And</a>
<a id='line_22909'>anon he laid his hand on the sword, and lightly drew it out of the</a>
<a id='line_22910'>stone, and put it in the sheath, and said unto the king: Now it goeth</a>
<a id='line_22911'>better than it did aforehand. Sir, said the king, a shield God shall</a>
<a id='line_22912'>send you. Now have I that sword that sometime was the good knight’s,</a>
<a id='line_22913'>Balin le Savage, and he was a passing good man of his hands; and with</a>
<a id='line_22914'>this sword he slew his brother Balan, and that was great pity, for he</a>
<a id='line_22915'>was a good knight, and either slew other through a dolorous stroke that</a>
<a id='line_22916'>Balin gave unto my grandfather King Pelles, the which is not yet whole,</a>
<a id='line_22917'>nor not shall be till I heal him.</a>
<a id='line_22918'></a>
<a id='line_22919'>Therewith the king and all espied where came riding down the river a</a>
<a id='line_22920'>lady on a white palfrey toward them. Then she saluted the king and the</a>
<a id='line_22921'>queen, and asked if that Sir Launcelot was there. And then he answered</a>
<a id='line_22922'>himself: I am here, fair lady. Then she said all with weeping: How your</a>
<a id='line_22923'>great doing is changed sith this day in the morn. Damosel, why say you</a>
<a id='line_22924'>so? said Launcelot. I say you sooth, said the damosel, for ye were this</a>
<a id='line_22925'>day the best knight of the world, but who should say so now, he should</a>
<a id='line_22926'>be a liar, for there is now one better than ye, and well it is proved</a>
<a id='line_22927'>by the adventures of the sword whereto ye durst not set to your hand;</a>
<a id='line_22928'>and that is the change and leaving of your name. Wherefore I make unto</a>
<a id='line_22929'>you a remembrance, that ye shall not ween from henceforth that ye be</a>
<a id='line_22930'>the best knight of the world. As touching unto that, said Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_22931'>know well I was never the best. Yes, said the damosel, that were ye,</a>
<a id='line_22932'>and are yet, of any sinful man of the world. And, Sir king, Nacien, the</a>
<a id='line_22933'>hermit, sendeth thee word, that thee shall befall the greatest worship</a>
<a id='line_22934'>that ever befell king in Britain; and I say you wherefore, for this day</a>
<a id='line_22935'>the Sangreal appeared in thy house and fed thee and all thy fellowship</a>
<a id='line_22936'>of the Round Table. So she departed and went that same way that she</a>
<a id='line_22937'>came.</a>
<a id='line_22938'></a>
<a id='line_22939'></a>
<a id='line_22940'></a>
<a id='line_22941'></a>
<a id='line_22942'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur had all the knights together for to joust</a>
<a id='line_22943'>in the meadow beside Camelot or they departed.</a>
<a id='line_22944'></a>
<a id='line_22945'></a>
<a id='line_22946'>Now, said the king, I am sure at this quest of the Sangreal shall all</a>
<a id='line_22947'>ye of the Table Round depart, and never shall I see you again whole</a>
<a id='line_22948'>together; therefore I will see you all whole together in the meadow of</a>
<a id='line_22949'>Camelot to joust and to tourney, that after your death men may speak of</a>
<a id='line_22950'>it that such good knights were wholly together such a day. As unto that</a>
<a id='line_22951'>counsel and at the king’s request they accorded all, and took on their</a>
<a id='line_22952'>harness that longed unto jousting. But all this moving of the king was</a>
<a id='line_22953'>for this intent, for to see Galahad proved; for the king deemed he</a>
<a id='line_22954'>should not lightly come again unto the court after his departing. So</a>
<a id='line_22955'>were they assembled in the meadow, both more and less. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_22956'>Galahad, by the prayer of the king and the queen, did upon him a noble</a>
<a id='line_22957'>jesseraunce, and also he did on his helm, but shield would he take none</a>
<a id='line_22958'>for no prayer of the king. And then Sir Gawaine and other knights</a>
<a id='line_22959'>prayed him to take a spear. Right so he did; and the queen was in a</a>
<a id='line_22960'>tower with all her ladies, for to behold that tournament. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_22961'>Galahad dressed him in midst of the meadow, and began to break spears</a>
<a id='line_22962'>marvellously, that all men had wonder of him; for he there surmounted</a>
<a id='line_22963'>all other knights, for within a while he had defouled many good knights</a>
<a id='line_22964'>of the Table Round save twain, that was Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_22965'>Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_22966'></a>
<a id='line_22967'></a>
<a id='line_22968'></a>
<a id='line_22969'></a>
<a id='line_22970'>CHAPTER VII. How the queen desired to see Galahad; and how after, all</a>
<a id='line_22971'>the knights were replenished with the Holy Sangreal, and how they</a>
<a id='line_22972'>avowed the enquest of the same.</a>
<a id='line_22973'></a>
<a id='line_22974'></a>
<a id='line_22975'>Then the king, at the queen’s request, made him to alight and to unlace</a>
<a id='line_22976'>his helm, that the queen might see him in the visage. When she beheld</a>
<a id='line_22977'>him she said: Soothly I dare well say that Sir Launcelot begat him, for</a>
<a id='line_22978'>never two men resembled more in likeness, therefore it nis no marvel</a>
<a id='line_22979'>though he be of great prowess. So a lady that stood by the queen said:</a>
<a id='line_22980'>Madam, for God’s sake ought he of right to be so good a knight? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_22981'>forsooth, said the queen, for he is of all parties come of the best</a>
<a id='line_22982'>knights of the world and of the highest lineage; for Sir Launcelot is</a>
<a id='line_22983'>come but of the eighth degree from our Lord Jesu Christ, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_22984'>Galahad is of the ninth degree from our Lord Jesu Christ, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_22985'>dare say they be the greatest gentlemen of the world.</a>
<a id='line_22986'></a>
<a id='line_22987'>And then the king and all estates went home unto Camelot, and so went</a>
<a id='line_22988'>to evensong to the great minster, and so after upon that to supper, and</a>
<a id='line_22989'>every knight sat in his own place as they were toforehand. Then anon</a>
<a id='line_22990'>they heard cracking and crying of thunder, that them thought the place</a>
<a id='line_22991'>should all to-drive. In the midst of this blast entered a sunbeam more</a>
<a id='line_22992'>clearer by seven times than ever they saw day, and all they were</a>
<a id='line_22993'>alighted of the grace of the Holy Ghost. Then began every knight to</a>
<a id='line_22994'>behold other, and either saw other, by their seeming, fairer than ever</a>
<a id='line_22995'>they saw afore. Not for then there was no knight might speak one word a</a>
<a id='line_22996'>great while, and so they looked every man on other as they had been</a>
<a id='line_22997'>dumb. Then there entered into the hall the Holy Grail covered with</a>
<a id='line_22998'>white samite, but there was none might see it, nor who bare it. And</a>
<a id='line_22999'>there was all the hall fulfilled with good odours, and every knight had</a>
<a id='line_23000'>such meats and drinks as he best loved in this world. And when the Holy</a>
<a id='line_23001'>Grail had been borne through the hall, then the holy vessel departed</a>
<a id='line_23002'>suddenly, that they wist not where it became: then had they all breath</a>
<a id='line_23003'>to speak. And then the king yielded thankings to God, of His good grace</a>
<a id='line_23004'>that he had sent them. Certes, said the king, we ought to thank our</a>
<a id='line_23005'>Lord Jesu greatly for that he hath shewed us this day, at the reverence</a>
<a id='line_23006'>of this high feast of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_23007'></a>
<a id='line_23008'>Now, said Sir Gawaine, we have been served this day of what meats and</a>
<a id='line_23009'>drinks we thought on; but one thing beguiled us, we might not see the</a>
<a id='line_23010'>Holy Grail, it was so preciously covered. Wherefore I will make here</a>
<a id='line_23011'>avow, that to-morn, without longer abiding, I shall labour in the quest</a>
<a id='line_23012'>of the Sangreal, that I shall hold me out a twelvemonth and a day, or</a>
<a id='line_23013'>more if need be, and never shall I return again unto the court till I</a>
<a id='line_23014'>have seen it more openly than it hath been seen here; and if I may not</a>
<a id='line_23015'>speed I shall return again as he that may not be against the will of</a>
<a id='line_23016'>our Lord Jesu Christ.</a>
<a id='line_23017'></a>
<a id='line_23018'>When they of the Table Round heard Sir Gawaine say so, they arose up</a>
<a id='line_23019'>the most part and made such avows as Sir Gawaine had made. Anon as King</a>
<a id='line_23020'>Arthur heard this he was greatly displeased, for he wist well they</a>
<a id='line_23021'>might not again-say their avows. Alas, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_23022'>Gawaine, ye have nigh slain me with the avow and promise that ye have</a>
<a id='line_23023'>made; for through you ye have bereft me the fairest fellowship and the</a>
<a id='line_23024'>truest of knighthood that ever were seen together in any realm of the</a>
<a id='line_23025'>world; for when they depart from hence I am sure they all shall never</a>
<a id='line_23026'>meet more in this world, for they shall die many in the quest. And so</a>
<a id='line_23027'>it forthinketh me a little, for I have loved them as well as my life,</a>
<a id='line_23028'>wherefore it shall grieve me right sore, the departition of this</a>
<a id='line_23029'>fellowship: for I have had an old custom to have them in my fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_23030'></a>
<a id='line_23031'></a>
<a id='line_23032'></a>
<a id='line_23033'></a>
<a id='line_23034'>CHAPTER VIII. How great sorrow was made of the king and the queen and</a>
<a id='line_23035'>ladies for the departing of the knights, and how they departed.</a>
<a id='line_23036'></a>
<a id='line_23037'></a>
<a id='line_23038'>And therewith the tears fell in his eyes. And then he said: Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_23039'>Gawaine, ye have set me in great sorrow, for I have great doubt that my</a>
<a id='line_23040'>true fellowship shall never meet here more again. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_23041'>Launcelot, comfort yourself; for it shall be unto us a great honour and</a>
<a id='line_23042'>much more than if we died in any other places, for of death we be</a>
<a id='line_23043'>siker. Ah, Launcelot, said the king, the great love that I have had</a>
<a id='line_23044'>unto you all the days of my life maketh me to say such doleful words;</a>
<a id='line_23045'>for never Christian king had never so many worthy men at his table as I</a>
<a id='line_23046'>have had this day at the Round Table, and that is my great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_23047'></a>
<a id='line_23048'>When the queen, ladies, and gentlewomen, wist these tidings, they had</a>
<a id='line_23049'>such sorrow and heaviness that there might no tongue tell it, for those</a>
<a id='line_23050'>knights had held them in honour and chierté. But among all other Queen</a>
<a id='line_23051'>Guenever made great sorrow. I marvel, said she, my lord would suffer</a>
<a id='line_23052'>them to depart from him. Thus was all the court troubled for the love</a>
<a id='line_23053'>of the departition of those knights. And many of those ladies that</a>
<a id='line_23054'>loved knights would have gone with their lovers; and so had they done,</a>
<a id='line_23055'>had not an old knight come among them in religious clothing; and then</a>
<a id='line_23056'>he spake all on high and said: Fair lords, which have sworn in the</a>
<a id='line_23057'>quest of the Sangreal, thus sendeth you Nacien, the hermit, word, that</a>
<a id='line_23058'>none in this quest lead lady nor gentlewoman with him, for it is not to</a>
<a id='line_23059'>do in so high a service as they labour in; for I warn you plain, he</a>
<a id='line_23060'>that is not clean of his sins he shall not see the mysteries of our</a>
<a id='line_23061'>Lord Jesu Christ. And for this cause they left these ladies and</a>
<a id='line_23062'>gentlewomen.</a>
<a id='line_23063'></a>
<a id='line_23064'>After this the queen came unto Galahad and asked him of whence he was,</a>
<a id='line_23065'>and of what country. He told her of whence he was. And son unto</a>
<a id='line_23066'>Launcelot, she said he was. As to that, he said neither yea nor nay. So</a>
<a id='line_23067'>God me help, said the queen, of your father ye need not to shame you,</a>
<a id='line_23068'>for he is the goodliest knight, and of the best men of the world come,</a>
<a id='line_23069'>and of the strain, of all parties, of kings. Wherefore ye ought of</a>
<a id='line_23070'>right to be, of your deeds, a passing good man; and certainly, she</a>
<a id='line_23071'>said, ye resemble him much. Then Sir Galahad was a little ashamed and</a>
<a id='line_23072'>said: Madam, sith ye know in certain, wherefore do ye ask it me? for he</a>
<a id='line_23073'>that is my father shall be known openly and all betimes. And then they</a>
<a id='line_23074'>went to rest them. And in the honour of the highness of Galahad he was</a>
<a id='line_23075'>led into King Arthur’s chamber, and there rested in his own bed.</a>
<a id='line_23076'></a>
<a id='line_23077'>And as soon as it was day the king arose, for he had no rest of all</a>
<a id='line_23078'>that night for sorrow. Then he went unto Gawaine and to Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_23079'>that were arisen for to hear mass. And then the king again said: Ah</a>
<a id='line_23080'>Gawaine, Gawaine, ye have betrayed me; for never shall my court be</a>
<a id='line_23081'>amended by you, but ye will never be sorry for me as I am for you. And</a>
<a id='line_23082'>therewith the tears began to run down by his visage. And therewith the</a>
<a id='line_23083'>king said: Ah, knight Sir Launcelot, I require thee thou counsel me,</a>
<a id='line_23084'>for I would that this quest were undone, an it might be Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_23085'>Launcelot, ye saw yesterday so many worthy knights that then were sworn</a>
<a id='line_23086'>that they may not leave it in no manner of wise. That wot I well, said</a>
<a id='line_23087'>the king, but it shall so heavy me at their departing that I wot well</a>
<a id='line_23088'>there shall no manner of joy remedy me. And then the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_23089'>went unto the minster. So anon Launcelot and Gawaine commanded their</a>
<a id='line_23090'>men to bring their arms. And when they all were armed save their</a>
<a id='line_23091'>shields and their helms, then they came to their fellowship, which were</a>
<a id='line_23092'>all ready in the same wise, for to go to the minster to hear their</a>
<a id='line_23093'>service.</a>
<a id='line_23094'></a>
<a id='line_23095'>Then after the service was done the king would wit how many had</a>
<a id='line_23096'>undertaken the quest of the Holy Grail; and to accompt them he prayed</a>
<a id='line_23097'>them all. Then found they by the tale an hundred and fifty, and all</a>
<a id='line_23098'>were knights of the Round Table. And then they put on their helms and</a>
<a id='line_23099'>departed, and recommended them all wholly unto the queen; and there was</a>
<a id='line_23100'>weeping and great sorrow. Then the queen departed into her chamber and</a>
<a id='line_23101'>held her, so that no man should perceive her great sorrows. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_23102'>Launcelot missed the queen he went till her chamber, and when she saw</a>
<a id='line_23103'>him she cried aloud: O Launcelot, Launcelot, ye have betrayed me and</a>
<a id='line_23104'>put me to the death, for to leave thus my lord. Ah, madam, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_23105'>be not displeased, for I shall come again as soon as I may with my</a>
<a id='line_23106'>worship. Alas, said she, that ever I saw you; but he that suffered upon</a>
<a id='line_23107'>the cross for all mankind, he be unto you good conduct and safety, and</a>
<a id='line_23108'>all the whole fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_23109'></a>
<a id='line_23110'>Right so departed Sir Launcelot, and found his fellowship that abode</a>
<a id='line_23111'>his coming. And so they mounted upon their horses and rode through the</a>
<a id='line_23112'>streets of Camelot; and there was weeping of rich and poor, and the</a>
<a id='line_23113'>king turned away and might not speak for weeping. So within a while</a>
<a id='line_23114'>they came to a city, and a castle that hight Vagon. There they entered</a>
<a id='line_23115'>into the castle, and the lord of that castle was an old man that hight</a>
<a id='line_23116'>Vagon, and he was a good man of his living, and set open the gates, and</a>
<a id='line_23117'>made them all the cheer that he might. And so on the morn they were all</a>
<a id='line_23118'>accorded that they should depart everych from other; and on the morn</a>
<a id='line_23119'>they departed with weeping cheer, and every knight took the way that</a>
<a id='line_23120'>him liked best.</a>
<a id='line_23121'></a>

<a id='line_23124'></a>
<a id='line_23125'>CHAPTER IX. How Galahad gat him a shield, and how they sped that</a>
<a id='line_23126'>presumed to take down the said shield.</a>
<a id='line_23127'></a>
<a id='line_23128'></a>
<a id='line_23129'>Now rideth Sir Galahad yet without shield, and so he rode four days</a>
<a id='line_23130'>without any adventure. And at the fourth day after evensong he came to</a>
<a id='line_23131'>a White Abbey, and there he was received with great reverence, and led</a>
<a id='line_23132'>unto a chamber, and there was he unarmed; and then was he ware of two</a>
<a id='line_23133'>knights of the Table Round, one was Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Uwaine.</a>
<a id='line_23134'></a>
<a id='line_23135'>And when they saw him they went unto Galahad and made of him great</a>
<a id='line_23136'>solace, and so they went unto supper. Sirs, said Sir Galahad, what</a>
<a id='line_23137'>adventure brought you hither? Sir, said they, it is told us that within</a>
<a id='line_23138'>this place is a shield that no man may bear about his neck but he be</a>
<a id='line_23139'>mischieved outher dead within three days, or maimed for ever. Ah sir,</a>
<a id='line_23140'>said King Bagdemagus, I shall it bear to-morrow for to assay this</a>
<a id='line_23141'>adventure. In the name of God, said Sir Galahad. Sir, said Bagdemagus,</a>
<a id='line_23142'>an I may not enchieve the adventure of this shield ye shall take it</a>
<a id='line_23143'>upon you, for I am sure ye shall not fail. Sir, said Galahad, I right</a>
<a id='line_23144'>well agree me thereto, for I have no shield. So on the morn they arose</a>
<a id='line_23145'>and heard mass. Then Bagdemagus asked where the adventurous shield was.</a>
<a id='line_23146'>Anon a monk led him behind an altar where the shield hung as white as</a>
<a id='line_23147'>any snow, but in the midst was a red cross. Sir, said the monk, this</a>
<a id='line_23148'>shield ought not to be hanged about no knight’s neck but he be the</a>
<a id='line_23149'>worthiest knight of the world;</a>
<a id='line_23150'></a>
<a id='line_23151'>therefore I counsel you knights to be well advised. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_23152'>Bagdemagus, I wot well that I am not the best knight of the world, but</a>
<a id='line_23153'>yet I shall assay to bear it, and so bare it out of the minster. And</a>
<a id='line_23154'>then he said unto Galahad: An it please you abide here still, till ye</a>
<a id='line_23155'>wit how that I speed. I shall abide you, said Galahad. Then King</a>
<a id='line_23156'>Bagdemagus took with him a good squire, to bring tidings unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_23157'>Galahad how he sped.</a>
<a id='line_23158'></a>
<a id='line_23159'>Then when they had ridden a two mile and came to a fair valley afore an</a>
<a id='line_23160'>hermitage, then they saw a knight come from that part in white armour,</a>
<a id='line_23161'>horse and all; and he came as fast as his horse might run, and his</a>
<a id='line_23162'>spear in his rest, and Bagdemagus dressed his spear against him and</a>
<a id='line_23163'>brake it upon the white knight. But the other struck him so hard that</a>
<a id='line_23164'>he brast the mails, and sheef him through the right shoulder, for the</a>
<a id='line_23165'>shield covered him not as at that time; and so he bare him from his</a>
<a id='line_23166'>horse. And therewith he alighted and took the white shield from him,</a>
<a id='line_23167'>saying: Knight, thou hast done thyself great folly, for this shield</a>
<a id='line_23168'>ought not to be borne but by him that shall have no peer that liveth.</a>
<a id='line_23169'>And then he came to Bagdemagus’ squire and said: Bear this shield unto</a>
<a id='line_23170'>the good knight Sir Galahad, that thou left in the abbey, and greet him</a>
<a id='line_23171'>well by me. Sir, said the squire, what is your name? Take thou no heed</a>
<a id='line_23172'>of my name, said the knight, for it is not for thee to know nor for</a>
<a id='line_23173'>none earthly man. Now, fair sir, said the squire, at the reverence of</a>
<a id='line_23174'>Jesu Christ, tell me for what cause this shield may not be borne but if</a>
<a id='line_23175'>the bearer thereof be mischieved. Now sith thou hast conjured me so,</a>
<a id='line_23176'>said the knight, this shield behoveth unto no man but unto Galahad. And</a>
<a id='line_23177'>the squire went unto Bagdemagus and asked whether he were sore wounded</a>
<a id='line_23178'>or not. Yea forsooth, said he, I shall escape hard from the death. Then</a>
<a id='line_23179'>he fetched his horse, and brought him with great pain unto an abbey.</a>
<a id='line_23180'>Then was he taken down softly and unarmed, and laid in a bed, and there</a>
<a id='line_23181'>was looked to his wounds. And as the book telleth, he lay there long,</a>
<a id='line_23182'>and escaped hard with the life.</a>
<a id='line_23183'></a>

<a id='line_23185'></a>
<a id='line_23186'></a>
<a id='line_23187'>CHAPTER X. How Galahad departed with the shield, and how King Evelake</a>
<a id='line_23188'>had received the shield of Joseph of Aramathie.</a>
<a id='line_23189'></a>
<a id='line_23190'></a>
<a id='line_23191'>Sir Galahad, said the squire, that knight that wounded Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_23192'>sendeth you greeting, and bade that ye should bear this shield,</a>
<a id='line_23193'>wherethrough great adventures should befall. Now blessed be God and</a>
<a id='line_23194'>fortune, said Galahad. And then he asked his arms, and mounted upon his</a>
<a id='line_23195'>horse, and hung the white shield about his neck, and commended them</a>
<a id='line_23196'>unto God. And Sir Uwaine said he would bear him fellowship if it</a>
<a id='line_23197'>pleased him. Sir, said Galahad, that may ye not, for I must go alone,</a>
<a id='line_23198'>save this squire shall bear me fellowship: and so departed Uwaine.</a>
<a id='line_23199'></a>
<a id='line_23200'>Then within a while came Galahad thereas the White Knight abode him by</a>
<a id='line_23201'>the hermitage, and everych saluted other courteously. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_23202'>Galahad, by this shield be many marvels fallen. Sir, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_23203'>it befell after the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ thirty-two year,</a>
<a id='line_23204'>that Joseph of Aramathie, the gentle knight, the which took down our</a>
<a id='line_23205'>Lord off the holy Cross, at that time he departed from Jerusalem with a</a>
<a id='line_23206'>great party of his kindred with him. And so he laboured till that they</a>
<a id='line_23207'>came to a city that hight Sarras. And at that same hour that Joseph</a>
<a id='line_23208'>came to Sarras there was a king that hight Evelake, that had great war</a>
<a id='line_23209'>against the Saracens, and in especial against one Saracen, the which</a>
<a id='line_23210'>was King Evelake’s cousin, a rich king and a mighty, which marched nigh</a>
<a id='line_23211'>this land, and his name was called Tolleme la Feintes. So on a day</a>
<a id='line_23212'>these two met to do battle. Then Joseph, the son of Joseph of</a>
<a id='line_23213'>Aramathie, went to King Evelake and told him he should be discomfit and</a>
<a id='line_23214'>slain, but if he left his belief of the old law and believed upon the</a>
<a id='line_23215'>new law. And then there he shewed him the right belief of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_23216'>Trinity, to the which he agreed unto with all his heart; and there this</a>
<a id='line_23217'>shield was made for King Evelake, in the name of Him that died upon the</a>
<a id='line_23218'>Cross. And then through his good belief he had the better of King</a>
<a id='line_23219'>Tolleme. For when Evelake was in the battle there was a cloth set afore</a>
<a id='line_23220'>the shield, and when he was in the greatest peril he let put away the</a>
<a id='line_23221'>cloth, and then his enemies saw a figure of a man on the Cross,</a>
<a id='line_23222'>wherethrough they all were discomfit. And so it befell that a man of</a>
<a id='line_23223'>King Evelake’s was smitten his hand off, and bare that hand in his</a>
<a id='line_23224'>other hand; and Joseph called that man unto him and bade him go with</a>
<a id='line_23225'>good devotion touch the Cross. And as soon as that man had touched the</a>
<a id='line_23226'>Cross with his hand it was as whole as ever it was to-fore. Then soon</a>
<a id='line_23227'>after there fell a great marvel, that the cross of the shield at one</a>
<a id='line_23228'>time vanished away that no man wist where it became. And then King</a>
<a id='line_23229'>Evelake was baptised, and for the most part all the people of that</a>
<a id='line_23230'>city. So, soon after Joseph would depart, and King Evelake would go</a>
<a id='line_23231'>with him, whether he wold or nold. And so by fortune they came into</a>
<a id='line_23232'>this land, that at that time was called Great Britain; and there they</a>
<a id='line_23233'>found a great felon paynim, that put Joseph into prison. And so by</a>
<a id='line_23234'>fortune tidings came unto a worthy man that hight Mondrames, and he</a>
<a id='line_23235'>assembled all his people for the great renown he had heard of Joseph;</a>
<a id='line_23236'>and so he came into the land of Great Britain and disherited this felon</a>
<a id='line_23237'>paynim and consumed him, and therewith delivered Joseph out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_23238'>And after that all the people were turned to the Christian faith.</a>
<a id='line_23239'></a>

<a id='line_23243'>CHAPTER XI. How Joseph made a cross on the white shield with his blood,</a>
<a id='line_23244'>and how Galahad was by a monk brought to a tomb.</a>
<a id='line_23245'></a>
<a id='line_23246'></a>
<a id='line_23247'>Not long after that Joseph was laid in his deadly bed. And when King</a>
<a id='line_23248'>Evelake saw that he made much sorrow, and said: For thy love I have</a>
<a id='line_23249'>left my country, and sith ye shall depart out of this world, leave me</a>
<a id='line_23250'>some token of yours that I may think on you. Joseph said: That will I</a>
<a id='line_23251'>do full gladly; now bring me your shield that I took you when ye went</a>
<a id='line_23252'>into battle against King Tolleme. Then Joseph bled sore at the nose, so</a>
<a id='line_23253'>that he might not by no mean be staunched. And there upon that shield</a>
<a id='line_23254'>he made a cross of his own blood. Now may ye see a remembrance that I</a>
<a id='line_23255'>love you, for ye shall never see this shield but ye shall think on me,</a>
<a id='line_23256'>and it shall be always as fresh as it is now. And never shall man bear</a>
<a id='line_23257'>this shield about his neck but he shall repent it, unto the time that</a>
<a id='line_23258'>Galahad, the good knight, bear it; and the last of my lineage shall</a>
<a id='line_23259'>have it about his neck, that shall do many marvellous deeds. Now, said</a>
<a id='line_23260'>King Evelake, where shall I put this shield, that this worthy knight</a>
<a id='line_23261'>may have it? Ye shall leave it thereas Nacien, the hermit, shall be put</a>
<a id='line_23262'>after his death; for thither shall that good knight come the fifteenth</a>
<a id='line_23263'>day after that he shall receive the order of knighthood: and so that</a>
<a id='line_23264'>day that they set is this time that he have his shield, and in the same</a>
<a id='line_23265'>abbey lieth Nacien, the hermit. And then the White Knight vanished</a>
<a id='line_23266'>away.</a>
<a id='line_23267'></a>
<a id='line_23268'>Anon as the squire had heard these words, he alighted off his hackney</a>
<a id='line_23269'>and kneeled down at Galahad’s feet, and prayed him that he might go</a>
<a id='line_23270'>with him till he had made him knight.</a>
<a id='line_23271'></a>
<a id='line_23272'>If I would not refuse you.</a>
<a id='line_23273'></a>
<a id='line_23274'>Then will ye make me a knight? said the squire, and that order, by the</a>
<a id='line_23275'>grace of God, shall be well set in me.</a>
<a id='line_23276'></a>
<a id='line_23277'>So Sir Galahad granted him, and turned again unto the abbey where they</a>
<a id='line_23278'>came from; and there men made great joy of Sir Galahad. And anon as he</a>
<a id='line_23279'>was alighted there was a monk brought him unto a tomb in a churchyard,</a>
<a id='line_23280'>where there was such a noise that who that heard it should verily nigh</a>
<a id='line_23281'>be mad or lose his strength: and sir, they said, we deem it is a fiend.</a>
<a id='line_23282'></a>
<a id='line_23283'></a>
<a id='line_23284'></a>
<a id='line_23285'></a>
<a id='line_23286'>CHAPTER XII. Of the marvel that Sir Galahad saw and heard in the tomb,</a>
<a id='line_23287'>and how he made Melias knight.</a>
<a id='line_23288'></a>
<a id='line_23289'></a>
<a id='line_23290'>Now lead me thither, said Galahad. And so they did, all armed save his</a>
<a id='line_23291'>helm. Now, said the good man, go to the tomb and lift it up. So he did,</a>
<a id='line_23292'>and heard a great noise; and piteously he said, that all men might hear</a>
<a id='line_23293'>it: Sir Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, come thou not nigh me, for</a>
<a id='line_23294'>thou shalt make me go again there where I have been so long. But</a>
<a id='line_23295'>Galahad was nothing afraid, but lifted up the stone; and there came out</a>
<a id='line_23296'>so foul a smoke, and after he saw the foulest figure leap thereout that</a>
<a id='line_23297'>ever he saw in the likeness of a man; and then he blessed him and wist</a>
<a id='line_23298'>well it was a fiend. Then heard he a voice say Galahad, I see there</a>
<a id='line_23299'>environ about thee so many angels that my power may not dere thee{sic}</a>
<a id='line_23300'>Right so Sir Galahad saw a body all armed lie in that tomb, and beside</a>
<a id='line_23301'>him a sword. Now, fair brother, said Galahad, let us remove this body,</a>
<a id='line_23302'>for it is not worthy to lie in this churchyard, for he was a false</a>
<a id='line_23303'>Christian man. And therewith they all departed and went to the abbey.</a>
<a id='line_23304'>And anon as he was unarmed a good man came and set him down by him and</a>
<a id='line_23305'>said: Sir, I shall tell you what betokeneth all that ye saw in the</a>
<a id='line_23306'>tomb; for that covered body betokeneth the duresse of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_23307'>the great sin that Our Lord found in the world. For there was such</a>
<a id='line_23308'>wretchedness that the father loved not the son, nor the son loved not</a>
<a id='line_23309'>the father; and that was one of the causes that Our Lord took flesh and</a>
<a id='line_23310'>blood of a clean maiden, for our sins were so great at that time that</a>
<a id='line_23311'>well-nigh all was wickedness. Truly, said Galahad, I believe you right</a>
<a id='line_23312'>well.</a>
<a id='line_23313'></a>
<a id='line_23314'>So Sir Galahad rested him there that night; and upon the morn he made</a>
<a id='line_23315'>the squire knight, and asked him his name, and of what kindred he was</a>
<a id='line_23316'>come. Sir, said he, men calleth me Melias de Lile, and I am the son of</a>
<a id='line_23317'>the King of Denmark. Now, fair sir, said Galahad, sith that ye be come</a>
<a id='line_23318'>of kings and queens, now look that knighthood be well set in you, for</a>
<a id='line_23319'>ye ought to be a mirror unto all chivalry. Sir, said Sir Melias, ye say</a>
<a id='line_23320'>sooth. But, sir, sithen ye have made me a knight ye must of right grant</a>
<a id='line_23321'>me my first desire that is reasonable. Ye say sooth, said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_23322'>Melias said: Then that ye will suffer me to ride with you in this quest</a>
<a id='line_23323'>of the Sangreal, till that some adventure depart us. I grant you, sir.</a>
<a id='line_23324'></a>
<a id='line_23325'>Then men brought Sir Melias his armour and his spear and his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_23326'>so Sir Galahad and he rode forth all that week or they found any</a>
<a id='line_23327'>adventure. And then upon a Monday in the morning, as they were departed</a>
<a id='line_23328'>from an abbey, they came to a cross which departed two ways, and in</a>
<a id='line_23329'>that cross were letters written that said thus: Now, ye knights errant,</a>
<a id='line_23330'>the which goeth to seek knights adventurous, see here two ways; that</a>
<a id='line_23331'>one way defendeth thee that thou ne go that way, for he shall not go</a>
<a id='line_23332'>out of the way again but if he be a good man and a worthy knight; and</a>
<a id='line_23333'>if thou go on the left hand, thou shalt not lightly there win prowess,</a>
<a id='line_23334'>for thou shalt in this way be soon assayed. Sir, said Melias to</a>
<a id='line_23335'>Galahad, if it like you to suffer me to take the way on the left hand,</a>
<a id='line_23336'>tell me, for there I shall well prove my strength. It were better, said</a>
<a id='line_23337'>Galahad, ye rode not that way, for I deem I should better escape in</a>
<a id='line_23338'>that way than ye. Nay, my lord, I pray you let me have that adventure.</a>
<a id='line_23339'>Take it in God’s name, said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_23340'></a>

<a id='line_23343'></a>
<a id='line_23344'>CHAPTER XIII. Of the adventure that Melias had, and how Galahad</a>
<a id='line_23345'>revenged him, and how Melias was carried into an abbey.</a>
<a id='line_23346'></a>
<a id='line_23347'></a>
<a id='line_23348'>And then rode Melias into an old forest, and therein he rode two days</a>
<a id='line_23349'>and more. And then he came into a fair meadow, and there was a fair</a>
<a id='line_23350'>lodge of boughs. And then he espied in that lodge a chair, wherein was</a>
<a id='line_23351'>a crown of gold, subtly wrought. Also there were cloths covered upon</a>
<a id='line_23352'>the earth, and many delicious meats set thereon. Sir Melias beheld this</a>
<a id='line_23353'>adventure, and thought it marvellous, but he had no hunger, but of the</a>
<a id='line_23354'>crown of gold he took much keep; and therewith he stooped down and took</a>
<a id='line_23355'>it up, and rode his way with it. And anon he saw a knight came riding</a>
<a id='line_23356'>after him that said: Knight, set down that crown which is not yours,</a>
<a id='line_23357'>and therefore defend you. Then Sir Melias blessed him and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_23358'>lord of heaven, help and save thy new-made knight. And then they let</a>
<a id='line_23359'>their horses run as fast as they might, so that the other knight smote</a>
<a id='line_23360'>Sir Melias through hauberk and through the left side, that he fell to</a>
<a id='line_23361'>the earth nigh dead. And then he took the crown and went his way; and</a>
<a id='line_23362'>Sir Melias lay still and had no power to stir.</a>
<a id='line_23363'></a>
<a id='line_23364'>In the meanwhile by fortune there came Sir Galahad and found him there</a>
<a id='line_23365'>in peril of death. And then he said: Ah Melias, who hath wounded you?</a>
<a id='line_23366'>therefore it had been better to have ridden the other way. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_23367'>Melias heard him speak: Sir, he said, for God’s love let me not die in</a>
<a id='line_23368'>this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here beside, that I may be</a>
<a id='line_23369'>confessed and have my rights. It shall be done, said Galahad, but where</a>
<a id='line_23370'>is he that hath wounded you? With that Sir Galahad heard in the leaves</a>
<a id='line_23371'>cry on high: Knight, keep thee from me. Ah sir, said Melias, beware,</a>
<a id='line_23372'>for that is he that hath slain me. Sir Galahad answered: Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_23373'>come on your peril. Then either dressed to other, and came together as</a>
<a id='line_23374'>fast as their horses might run, and Galahad smote him so that his spear</a>
<a id='line_23375'>went through his shoulder, and smote him down off his horse, and in the</a>
<a id='line_23376'>falling Galahad’s spear brake.</a>
<a id='line_23377'></a>
<a id='line_23378'>With that came out another knight out of the leaves, and brake a spear</a>
<a id='line_23379'>upon Galahad or ever he might turn him. Then Galahad drew out his sword</a>
<a id='line_23380'>and smote off the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth. And</a>
<a id='line_23381'>then he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast after him. And then he</a>
<a id='line_23382'>turned again unto Sir Melias, and there he alighted and dressed him</a>
<a id='line_23383'>softly on his horse to-fore him, for the truncheon of his spear was in</a>
<a id='line_23384'>his body; and Sir Galahad stert up behind him, and held him in his</a>
<a id='line_23385'>arms, and so brought him to the abbey, and there unarmed him and</a>
<a id='line_23386'>brought him to his chamber. And then he asked his Saviour. And when he</a>
<a id='line_23387'>had received Him he said unto Sir Galahad: Sir, let death come when it</a>
<a id='line_23388'>pleaseth him. And therewith he drew out the truncheon of the spear out</a>
<a id='line_23389'>of his body: and then he swooned.</a>
<a id='line_23390'></a>
<a id='line_23391'>Then came there an old monk which sometime had been a knight, and</a>
<a id='line_23392'>beheld Sir Melias. And anon he ransacked him; and then he said unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_23393'>Galahad: I shall heal him of his wound, by the grace of God, within the</a>
<a id='line_23394'>term of seven weeks. Then was Sir Galahad glad, and unarmed him, and</a>
<a id='line_23395'>said he would abide there three days. And then he asked Sir Melias how</a>
<a id='line_23396'>it stood with him. Then he said he was turned unto helping, God be</a>
<a id='line_23397'>thanked.</a>

<a id='line_23402'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Galahad departed, and how he was commanded to go</a>
<a id='line_23403'>to the Castle of Maidens to destroy the wicked custom.</a>
<a id='line_23404'></a>
<a id='line_23405'></a>
<a id='line_23406'>Now will I depart, said Galahad, for I have much on hand, for many good</a>
<a id='line_23407'>knights be full busy about it, and this knight and I were in the same</a>
<a id='line_23408'>quest of the Sangreal. Sir, said a good man, for his sin he was thus</a>
<a id='line_23409'>wounded; and I marvel, said the good man, how ye durst take upon you so</a>
<a id='line_23410'>rich a thing as the high order of knighthood without clean confession,</a>
<a id='line_23411'>and that was the cause ye were bitterly wounded. For the way on the</a>
<a id='line_23412'>right hand betokeneth the highway of our Lord Jesu Christ, and the way</a>
<a id='line_23413'>of a good true good liver. And the other way betokeneth the way of</a>
<a id='line_23414'>sinners and of misbelievers. And when the devil saw your pride and</a>
<a id='line_23415'>presumption, for to take you in the quest of the Sangreal, that made</a>
<a id='line_23416'>you to be overthrown, for it may not be enchieved but by virtuous</a>
<a id='line_23417'>living. Also, the writing on the cross was a signification of heavenly</a>
<a id='line_23418'>deeds, and of knightly deeds in God’s works, and no knightly deeds in</a>
<a id='line_23419'>worldly works. And pride is head of all deadly sins, that caused this</a>
<a id='line_23420'>knight to depart from Galahad. And where thou tookest the crown of gold</a>
<a id='line_23421'>thou sinnest in covetise and in theft: all this were no knightly deeds.</a>
<a id='line_23422'>And this Galahad, the holy knight, the which fought with the two</a>
<a id='line_23423'>knights, the two knights signify the two deadly sins which were wholly</a>
<a id='line_23424'>in this knight Melias; and they might not withstand you, for ye are</a>
<a id='line_23425'>without deadly sin.</a>
<a id='line_23426'></a>
<a id='line_23427'>Now departed Galahad from thence, and betaught them all unto God. Sir</a>
<a id='line_23428'>Melias said: My lord Galahad, as soon as I may ride I shall seek you.</a>
<a id='line_23429'>God send you health, said Galahad, and so took his horse and departed,</a>
<a id='line_23430'>and rode many journeys forward and backward, as adventure would lead</a>
<a id='line_23431'>him. And at the last it happened him to depart from a place or a castle</a>
<a id='line_23432'>the which was named Abblasoure; and he had heard no mass, the which he</a>
<a id='line_23433'>was wont ever to hear or ever he departed out of any castle or place,</a>
<a id='line_23434'>and kept that for a custom. Then Sir Galahad came unto a mountain where</a>
<a id='line_23435'>he found an old chapel, and found there nobody, for all, all was</a>
<a id='line_23436'>desolate; and there he kneeled to-fore the altar, and besought God of</a>
<a id='line_23437'>wholesome counsel. So as he prayed he heard a voice that said: Go thou</a>
<a id='line_23438'>now, thou adventurous knight, to the Castle of Maidens, and there do</a>
<a id='line_23439'>thou away the wicked customs.</a>
<a id='line_23440'></a>

<a id='line_23442'></a>
<a id='line_23443'></a>
<a id='line_23444'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Galahad fought with the knights of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_23445'>destroyed the wicked custom.</a>
<a id='line_23446'></a>
<a id='line_23447'></a>
<a id='line_23448'>When Sir Galahad heard this he thanked God, and took his horse; and he</a>
<a id='line_23449'>had not ridden but half a mile, he saw in the valley afore him a strong</a>
<a id='line_23450'>castle with deep ditches, and there ran beside it a fair river that</a>
<a id='line_23451'>hight Severn; and there he met with a man of great age, and either</a>
<a id='line_23452'>saluted other, and Galahad asked him the castle’s name. Fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_23453'>he, it is the Castle of Maidens. That is a cursed castle, said Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_23454'>and all they that be conversant therein, for all pity is out thereof,</a>
<a id='line_23455'>and all hardiness and mischief is therein. Therefore, I counsel you,</a>
<a id='line_23456'>sir knight, to turn again. Sir, said Galahad, wit you well I shall not</a>
<a id='line_23457'>turn again. Then looked Sir Galahad on his arms that nothing failed</a>
<a id='line_23458'>him, and then he put his shield afore him; and anon there met him seven</a>
<a id='line_23459'>fair maidens, the which said unto him: Sir knight, ye ride here in a</a>
<a id='line_23460'>great folly, for ye have the water to pass over. Why should I not pass</a>
<a id='line_23461'>the water? said Galahad. So rode he away from them and met with a</a>
<a id='line_23462'>squire that said: Knight, those knights in the castle defy you, and</a>
<a id='line_23463'>defenden you ye go no further till that they wit what ye would. Fair</a>
<a id='line_23464'>sir, said Galahad, I come for to destroy the wicked custom of this</a>
<a id='line_23465'>castle. Sir, an ye will abide by that ye shall have enough to do. Go</a>
<a id='line_23466'>you now, said Galahad, and haste my needs.</a>
<a id='line_23467'></a>
<a id='line_23468'>Then the squire entered into the castle. And anon after there came out</a>
<a id='line_23469'>of the castle seven knights, and all were brethren. And when they saw</a>
<a id='line_23470'>Galahad they cried: Knight, keep thee, for we assure thee nothing but</a>
<a id='line_23471'>death. Why, said Galahad, will ye all have ado with me at once? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_23472'>said they, thereto mayst thou trust. Then Galahad put forth his spear</a>
<a id='line_23473'>and smote the foremost to the earth, that near he brake his neck. And</a>
<a id='line_23474'>therewithal the other smote him on his shield great strokes, so that</a>
<a id='line_23475'>their spears brake. Then Sir Galahad drew out his sword, and set upon</a>
<a id='line_23476'>them so hard that it was marvel to see it, and so through great force</a>
<a id='line_23477'>he made them to forsake the field; and Galahad chased them till they</a>
<a id='line_23478'>entered into the castle, and so passed through the castle at another</a>
<a id='line_23479'>gate.</a>
<a id='line_23480'></a>
<a id='line_23481'>And there met Sir Galahad an old man clothed in religious clothing, and</a>
<a id='line_23482'>said: Sir, have here the keys of this castle. Then Sir Galahad opened</a>
<a id='line_23483'>the gates, and saw so much people in the streets that he might not</a>
<a id='line_23484'>number them, and all said: Sir, ye be welcome, for long have we abiden</a>
<a id='line_23485'>here our deliverance. Then came to him a gentlewoman and said: These</a>
<a id='line_23486'>knights be fled, but they will come again this night, and here to begin</a>
<a id='line_23487'>again their evil custom. What will ye that I shall do? said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_23488'>Sir, said the gentlewoman, that ye send after all the knights hither</a>
<a id='line_23489'>that hold their lands of this castle, and make them to swear for to use</a>
<a id='line_23490'>the customs that were used heretofore of old time. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_23491'>Galahad. And there she brought him an horn of ivory, bounden with gold</a>
<a id='line_23492'>richly, and said: Sir, blow this horn which will be heard two mile</a>
<a id='line_23493'>about this castle. When Sir Galahad had blown the horn he set him down</a>
<a id='line_23494'>upon a bed.</a>
<a id='line_23495'></a>
<a id='line_23496'>Then came a priest to Galahad, and said: Sir, it is past a seven year</a>
<a id='line_23497'>agone that these seven brethren came into this castle, and harboured</a>
<a id='line_23498'>with the lord of this castle that hight the Duke Lianour, and he was</a>
<a id='line_23499'>lord of all this country. And when they espied the duke’s daughter,</a>
<a id='line_23500'>that was a full fair woman, then by their false covin they made debate</a>
<a id='line_23501'>betwixt themself, and the duke of his goodness would have departed</a>
<a id='line_23502'>them, and there they slew him and his eldest son. And then they took</a>
<a id='line_23503'>the maiden and the treasure of the castle. And then by great force they</a>
<a id='line_23504'>held all the knights of this castle against their will under their</a>
<a id='line_23505'>obeissance, and in great service and truage, robbing and pilling the</a>
<a id='line_23506'>poor common people of all that they had. So it happened on a day the</a>
<a id='line_23507'>duke’s daughter said: Ye have done unto me great wrong to slay mine own</a>
<a id='line_23508'>father, and my brother, and thus to hold our lands: not for then, she</a>
<a id='line_23509'>said, ye shall not hold this castle for many years, for by one knight</a>
<a id='line_23510'>ye shall be overcome. Thus she prophesied seven years agone. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_23511'>the seven knights, sithen ye say so, there shall never lady nor knight</a>
<a id='line_23512'>pass this castle but they shall abide maugre their heads, or die</a>
<a id='line_23513'>therefore, till that knight be come by whom we shall lose this castle.</a>
<a id='line_23514'>And therefore is it called the Maidens’ Castle, for they have devoured</a>
<a id='line_23515'>many maidens. Now, said Galahad, is she here for whom this castle was</a>
<a id='line_23516'>lost? Nay sir, said the priest, she was dead within these three nights</a>
<a id='line_23517'>after that she was thus enforced; and sithen have they kept her younger</a>
<a id='line_23518'>sister, which endureth great pains with mo other ladies.</a>
<a id='line_23519'></a>
<a id='line_23520'>By this were the knights of the country come, and then he made them do</a>
<a id='line_23521'>homage and fealty to the king’s daughter, and set them in great ease of</a>
<a id='line_23522'>heart. And in the morn there came one to Galahad and told him how that</a>
<a id='line_23523'>Gawaine, Gareth, and Uwaine, had slain the seven brethren. I suppose</a>
<a id='line_23524'>well, said Sir Galahad, and took his armour and his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_23525'>commended them unto God.</a>
<a id='line_23526'></a>
<a id='line_23527'></a>

<a id='line_23529'></a>
<a id='line_23530'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Gawaine came to the abbey for to follow Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_23531'>and how he was shriven to a hermit.</a>
<a id='line_23532'></a>
<a id='line_23533'></a>
<a id='line_23534'>Now, saith the tale, after Sir Gawaine departed, he rode many journeys,</a>
<a id='line_23535'>both toward and froward. And at the last he came to the abbey where Sir</a>
<a id='line_23536'>Galahad had the white shield, and there Sir Gawaine learned the way to</a>
<a id='line_23537'>sewe after Sir Galahad; and so he rode to the abbey where Melias lay</a>
<a id='line_23538'>sick, and there Sir Melias told Sir Gawaine of the marvellous</a>
<a id='line_23539'>adventures that Sir Galahad did. Certes, said Sir Gawaine, I am not</a>
<a id='line_23540'>happy that I took not the way that he went, for an I may meet with him</a>
<a id='line_23541'>I will not depart from him lightly, for all marvellous adventures Sir</a>
<a id='line_23542'>Galahad enchieveth. Sir, said one of the monks, he will not of your</a>
<a id='line_23543'>fellowship. Why? said Sir Gawaine. Sir, said he, for ye be wicked and</a>
<a id='line_23544'>sinful, and he is full blessed. Right as they thus stood talking there</a>
<a id='line_23545'>came in riding Sir Gareth. And then they made joy either of other. And</a>
<a id='line_23546'>on the morn they heard mass, and so departed. And by the way they met</a>
<a id='line_23547'>with Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and there Sir Uwaine told Sir Gawaine how</a>
<a id='line_23548'>he had met with none adventure sith he departed from the court. Nor we,</a>
<a id='line_23549'>said Sir Gawaine. And either promised other of the three knights not to</a>
<a id='line_23550'>depart while they were in that quest, but if fortune caused it.</a>
<a id='line_23551'></a>
<a id='line_23552'>So they departed and rode by fortune till that they came by the Castle</a>
<a id='line_23553'>of Maidens; and there the seven brethren espied the three knights, and</a>
<a id='line_23554'>said: Sithen, we be flemed by one knight from this castle, we shall</a>
<a id='line_23555'>destroy all the knights of King Arthur’s that we may overcome, for the</a>
<a id='line_23556'>love of Sir Galahad. And therewith the seven knights set upon the three</a>
<a id='line_23557'>knights, and by fortune Sir Gawaine slew one of the brethren, and each</a>
<a id='line_23558'>one of his fellows slew another, and so slew the remnant. And then they</a>
<a id='line_23559'>took the way under the castle, and there they lost the way that Sir</a>
<a id='line_23560'>Galahad rode, and there everych of them departed from other; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_23561'>Gawaine rode till he came to an hermitage, and there he found the good</a>
<a id='line_23562'>man saying his evensong of Our Lady; and there Sir Gawaine asked</a>
<a id='line_23563'>harbour for charity, and the good man granted it him gladly.</a>
<a id='line_23564'></a>
<a id='line_23565'>Then the good man asked him what he was. Sir, he said, I am a knight of</a>
<a id='line_23566'>King Arthur’s that am in the quest of the Sangreal, and my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_23567'>Gawaine. Sir, said the good man, I would wit how it standeth betwixt</a>
<a id='line_23568'>God and you. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I will with a good will shew you my</a>
<a id='line_23569'>life if it please you; and there he told the hermit how a monk of an</a>
<a id='line_23570'>abbey called me wicked knight. He might well say it, said the hermit,</a>
<a id='line_23571'>for when ye were first made knight ye should have taken you to knightly</a>
<a id='line_23572'>deeds and virtuous living, and ye have done the contrary, for ye have</a>
<a id='line_23573'>lived mischievously many winters; and Sir Galahad is a maid and sinned</a>
<a id='line_23574'>never, and that is the cause he shall enchieve where he goeth that ye</a>
<a id='line_23575'>nor none such shall not attain, nor none in your fellowship, for ye</a>
<a id='line_23576'>have used the most untruest life that ever I heard knight live. For</a>
<a id='line_23577'>certes had ye not been so wicked as ye are, never had the seven</a>
<a id='line_23578'>brethren been slain by you and your two fellows. For Sir Galahad</a>
<a id='line_23579'>himself alone beat them all seven the day to-fore, but his living is</a>
<a id='line_23580'>such he shall slay no man lightly. Also I may say you the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_23581'>Maidens betokeneth the good souls that were in prison afore the</a>
<a id='line_23582'>Incarnation of Jesu Christ. And the seven knights betoken the seven</a>
<a id='line_23583'>deadly sins that reigned that time in the world; and I may liken the</a>
<a id='line_23584'>good Galahad unto the son of the High Father, that lighted within a</a>
<a id='line_23585'>maid, and bought all the souls out of thrall, so did Sir Galahad</a>
<a id='line_23586'>deliver all the maidens out of the woful castle.</a>
<a id='line_23587'></a>
<a id='line_23588'>Now, Sir Gawaine, said the good man, thou must do penance for thy sin.</a>
<a id='line_23589'>Sir, what penance shall I do? Such as I will give, said the good man.</a>
<a id='line_23590'>Nay, said Sir Gawaine, I may do no penance; for we knights adventurous</a>
<a id='line_23591'>oft suffer great woe and pain. Well, said the good man, and then he</a>
<a id='line_23592'>held his peace. And on the morn Sir Gawaine departed from the hermit,</a>
<a id='line_23593'>and betaught him unto God. And by adventure he met with Sir Aglovale</a>
<a id='line_23594'>and Sir Griflet, two knights of the Table Round. And they two rode four</a>
<a id='line_23595'>days without finding of any adventure, and at the fifth day they</a>
<a id='line_23596'>departed. And everych held as fell them by adventure. Here leaveth the</a>
<a id='line_23597'>tale of Sir Gawaine and his fellows, and speak we of Sir Galahad.</a>

<a id='line_23602'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Galahad met with Sir Launcelot and Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_23603'>and smote them down, and departed from them.</a>
<a id='line_23604'></a>
<a id='line_23605'></a>
<a id='line_23606'>So when Sir Galahad was departed from the Castle of Maidens he rode</a>
<a id='line_23607'>till he came to a waste forest, and there he met with Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_23608'>Sir Percivale, but they knew him not, for he was new disguised. Right</a>
<a id='line_23609'>so Sir Launcelot, his father, dressed his spear and brake it upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_23610'>Galahad, and Galahad smote him so again that he smote down horse and</a>
<a id='line_23611'>man. And then he drew his sword, and dressed him unto Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_23612'>and smote him so on the helm, that it rove to the coif of steel; and</a>
<a id='line_23613'>had not the sword swerved Sir Percivale had been slain, and with the</a>
<a id='line_23614'>stroke he fell out of his saddle. This jousts was done to-fore the</a>
<a id='line_23615'>hermitage where a recluse dwelled. And when she saw Sir Galahad ride,</a>
<a id='line_23616'>she said: God be with thee, best knight of the world. Ah certes, said</a>
<a id='line_23617'>she, all aloud that Launcelot and Percivale might hear it: An yonder</a>
<a id='line_23618'>two knights had known thee as well as I do they would not have</a>
<a id='line_23619'>encountered with thee. Then Sir Galahad heard her say so he was adread</a>
<a id='line_23620'>to be known: therewith he smote his horse with his spurs and rode a</a>
<a id='line_23621'>great pace froward them. Then perceived they both that he was Galahad;</a>
<a id='line_23622'>and up they gat on their horses, and rode fast after him, but in a</a>
<a id='line_23623'>while he was out of their sight. And then they turned again with heavy</a>
<a id='line_23624'>cheer. Let us spere some tidings, said Percivale, at yonder recluse. Do</a>
<a id='line_23625'>as ye list, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_23626'></a>
<a id='line_23627'>When Sir Percivale came to the recluse she knew him well enough, and</a>
<a id='line_23628'>Sir Launcelot both. But Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a</a>
<a id='line_23629'>wild forest, and held no path but as wild adventure led him. And at the</a>
<a id='line_23630'>last he came to a stony cross which departed two ways in waste land;</a>
<a id='line_23631'>and by the cross was a stone that was of marble, but it was so dark</a>
<a id='line_23632'>that Sir Launcelot might not wit what it was. Then Sir Launcelot looked</a>
<a id='line_23633'>by him, and saw an old chapel, and there he weened to have found</a>
<a id='line_23634'>people; and Sir Launcelot tied his horse till a tree, and there he did</a>
<a id='line_23635'>off his shield and hung it upon a tree, and then went to the chapel</a>
<a id='line_23636'>door, and found it waste and broken. And within he found a fair altar,</a>
<a id='line_23637'>full richly arrayed with cloth of clean silk, and there stood a fair</a>
<a id='line_23638'>clean candlestick, which bare six great candles, and the candlestick</a>
<a id='line_23639'>was of silver. And when Sir Launcelot saw this light he had great will</a>
<a id='line_23640'>for to enter into the chapel, but he could find no place where he might</a>
<a id='line_23641'>enter; then was he passing heavy and dismayed. Then he returned and</a>
<a id='line_23642'>came to his horse and did off his saddle and bridle, and let him</a>
<a id='line_23643'>pasture, and unlaced his helm, and ungirt his sword, and laid him down</a>
<a id='line_23644'>to sleep upon his shield to-fore the cross.</a>
<a id='line_23645'></a>

<a id='line_23648'></a>
<a id='line_23649'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot, half sleeping and half waking, saw a</a>
<a id='line_23650'>sick man borne in a litter, and how he was healed with the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_23651'></a>
<a id='line_23652'></a>
<a id='line_23653'>And so he fell asleep; and half waking and sleeping he saw come by him</a>
<a id='line_23654'>two palfreys all fair and white, the which bare a litter, therein lying</a>
<a id='line_23655'>a sick knight. And when he was nigh the cross he there abode still. All</a>
<a id='line_23656'>this Sir Launcelot saw and beheld, for he slept not verily; and he</a>
<a id='line_23657'>heard him say: O sweet Lord, when shall this sorrow leave me? and when</a>
<a id='line_23658'>shall the holy vessel come by me, wherethrough I shall be blessed? For</a>
<a id='line_23659'>I have endured thus long, for little trespass. A full great while</a>
<a id='line_23660'>complained the knight thus, and always Sir Launcelot heard it. With</a>
<a id='line_23661'>that Sir Launcelot saw the candlestick with the six tapers come before</a>
<a id='line_23662'>the cross, and he saw nobody that brought it. Also there came a table</a>
<a id='line_23663'>of silver, and the holy vessel of the Sangreal, which Launcelot had</a>
<a id='line_23664'>seen aforetime in King Pescheour’s house. And therewith the sick knight</a>
<a id='line_23665'>set him up, and held up both his hands, and said: Fair sweet Lord,</a>
<a id='line_23666'>which is here within this holy vessel; take heed unto me that I may be</a>
<a id='line_23667'>whole of this malady. And therewith on his hands and on his knees he</a>
<a id='line_23668'>went so nigh that he touched the holy vessel and kissed it, and anon he</a>
<a id='line_23669'>was whole; and then he said: Lord God, I thank thee, for I am healed of</a>
<a id='line_23670'>this sickness.</a>
<a id='line_23671'></a>
<a id='line_23672'>So when the holy vessel had been there a great while it went unto the</a>
<a id='line_23673'>chapel with the chandelier and the light, so that Launcelot wist not</a>
<a id='line_23674'>where it was become; for he was overtaken with sin that he had no power</a>
<a id='line_23675'>to rise again the holy vessel; wherefore after that many men said of</a>
<a id='line_23676'>him shame, but he took repentance after that. Then the sick knight</a>
<a id='line_23677'>dressed him up and kissed the cross; anon his squire brought him his</a>
<a id='line_23678'>arms, and asked his lord how he did. Certes, said he, I thank God right</a>
<a id='line_23679'>well, through the holy vessel I am healed. But I have marvel of this</a>
<a id='line_23680'>sleeping knight that had no power to awake when this holy vessel was</a>
<a id='line_23681'>brought hither. I dare right well say, said the squire, that he</a>
<a id='line_23682'>dwelleth in some deadly sin whereof he was never confessed. By my</a>
<a id='line_23683'>faith, said the knight, whatsomever he be he is unhappy, for as I deem</a>
<a id='line_23684'>he is of the fellowship of the Round Table, the which is entered into</a>
<a id='line_23685'>the quest of the Sangreal. Sir, said the squire, here I have brought</a>
<a id='line_23686'>you all your arms save your helm and your sword, and therefore by mine</a>
<a id='line_23687'>assent now may ye take this knight’s helm and his sword: and so he did.</a>
<a id='line_23688'>And when he was clean armed he took Sir Launcelot’s horse, for he was</a>
<a id='line_23689'>better than his; and so departed they from the cross.</a>
<a id='line_23690'></a>
<a id='line_23691'></a>
<a id='line_23692'></a>
<a id='line_23693'></a>
<a id='line_23694'>CHAPTER XIX. How a voice spake to Sir Launcelot, and how he found his</a>
<a id='line_23695'>horse and his helm borne away, and after went afoot.</a>
<a id='line_23696'></a>
<a id='line_23697'></a>
<a id='line_23698'>Then anon Sir Launcelot waked, and set him up, and bethought him what</a>
<a id='line_23699'>he had seen there, and whether it were dreams or not. Right so heard he</a>
<a id='line_23700'>a voice that said: Sir Launcelot, more harder than is the stone, and</a>
<a id='line_23701'>more bitter than is the wood, and more naked and barer than is the leaf</a>
<a id='line_23702'>of the fig tree; therefore go thou from hence, and withdraw thee from</a>
<a id='line_23703'>this holy place. And when Sir Launcelot heard this he was passing heavy</a>
<a id='line_23704'>and wist not what to do, and so departed sore weeping, and cursed the</a>
<a id='line_23705'>time that he was born. For then he deemed never to have had worship</a>
<a id='line_23706'>more. For those words went to his heart, till that he knew wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_23707'>was called so. Then Sir Launcelot went to the cross and found his helm,</a>
<a id='line_23708'>his sword, and his horse taken away. And then he called himself a very</a>
<a id='line_23709'>wretch, and most unhappy of all knights; and there he said: My sin and</a>
<a id='line_23710'>my wickedness have brought me unto great dishonour. For when I sought</a>
<a id='line_23711'>worldly adventures for worldly desires, I ever enchieved them and had</a>
<a id='line_23712'>the better in every place, and never was I discomfit in no quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_23713'>were it right or wrong. And now I take upon me the adventures of holy</a>
<a id='line_23714'>things, and now I see and understand that mine old sin hindereth me and</a>
<a id='line_23715'>shameth me, so that I had no power to stir nor speak when the holy</a>
<a id='line_23716'>blood appeared afore me. So thus he sorrowed till it was day, and heard</a>
<a id='line_23717'>the fowls sing: then somewhat he was comforted. But when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_23718'>missed his horse and his harness then he wist well God was displeased</a>
<a id='line_23719'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_23720'></a>
<a id='line_23721'>Then he departed from the cross on foot into a forest; and so by prime</a>
<a id='line_23722'>he came to an high hill, and found an hermitage and a hermit therein</a>
<a id='line_23723'>which was going unto mass. And then Launcelot kneeled down and cried on</a>
<a id='line_23724'>Our Lord mercy for his wicked works. So when mass was done Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_23725'>called him, and prayed him for charity for to hear his life. With a</a>
<a id='line_23726'>good will, said the good man. Sir, said he, be ye of King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_23727'>court and of the fellowship of the Round Table? Yea forsooth, and my</a>
<a id='line_23728'>name is Sir Launcelot du Lake that hath been right well said of, and</a>
<a id='line_23729'>now my good fortune is changed, for I am the most wretch of the world.</a>
<a id='line_23730'>The hermit beheld him and had marvel how he was so abashed. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_23731'>the hermit, ye ought to thank God more than any knight living, for He</a>
<a id='line_23732'>hath caused you to have more worldly worship than any knight that now</a>
<a id='line_23733'>liveth. And for your presumption to take upon you in deadly sin for to</a>
<a id='line_23734'>be in His presence, where His flesh and His blood was, that caused you</a>
<a id='line_23735'>ye might not see it with worldly eyes; for He will not appear where</a>
<a id='line_23736'>such sinners be, but if it be unto their great hurt and unto their</a>
<a id='line_23737'>great shame; and there is no knight living now that ought to give God</a>
<a id='line_23738'>so great thank as ye, for He hath given you beauty, seemliness, and</a>
<a id='line_23739'>great strength above all other knights; and therefore ye are the more</a>
<a id='line_23740'>beholding unto God than any other man, to love Him and dread Him, for</a>
<a id='line_23741'>your strength and manhood will little avail you an God be against you.</a>

<a id='line_23746'>CHAPTER XX. How Sir Launcelot was shriven, and what sorrow he made and</a>
<a id='line_23747'>of the good ensamples which were shewed him.</a>
<a id='line_23748'></a>
<a id='line_23749'></a>
<a id='line_23750'>Then Sir Launcelot wept with heavy cheer, and said: Now I know well ye</a>
<a id='line_23751'>say me sooth. Sir, said the good man, hide none old sin from me. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_23752'>said Sir Launcelot, that were me full loath to discover. For this</a>
<a id='line_23753'>fourteen year I never discovered one thing that I have used, and that</a>
<a id='line_23754'>may I now wite my shame and my disadventure. And then he told there</a>
<a id='line_23755'>that good man all his life. And how he had loved a queen unmeasurably</a>
<a id='line_23756'>and out of measure long. And all my great deeds of arms that I have</a>
<a id='line_23757'>done, I did for the most part for the queen’s sake, and for her sake</a>
<a id='line_23758'>would I do battle were it right or wrong, and never did I battle all</a>
<a id='line_23759'>only for God’s sake, but for to win worship and to cause me to be the</a>
<a id='line_23760'>better beloved and little or nought I thanked God of it. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_23761'>Launcelot said: I pray you counsel me. I will counsel you, said the</a>
<a id='line_23762'>hermit, if ye will ensure me that ye will never come in that queen’s</a>
<a id='line_23763'>fellowship as much as ye may forbear. And then Sir Launcelot promised</a>
<a id='line_23764'>him he nold, by the faith of his body. Look that your heart and your</a>
<a id='line_23765'>mouth accord, said the good man, and I shall ensure you ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_23766'>more worship than ever ye had.</a>
<a id='line_23767'></a>
<a id='line_23768'>Holy father, said Sir Launcelot, I marvel of the voice that said to me</a>
<a id='line_23769'>marvellous words, as ye have heard to-forehand. Have ye no marvel, said</a>
<a id='line_23770'>the good man thereof, for it seemeth well God loveth you; for men may</a>
<a id='line_23771'>understand a stone is hard of kind, and namely one more than another;</a>
<a id='line_23772'>and that is to understand by thee, Sir Launcelot, for thou wilt not</a>
<a id='line_23773'>leave thy sin for no goodness that God hath sent thee; therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_23774'>art more than any stone, and never wouldst thou be made nesh nor by</a>
<a id='line_23775'>water nor by fire, and that is the heat of the Holy Ghost may not enter</a>
<a id='line_23776'>in thee. Now take heed, in all the world men shall not find one knight</a>
<a id='line_23777'>to whom Our Lord hath given so much of grace as He hath given you, for</a>
<a id='line_23778'>He hath given you fairness with seemliness, He hath given thee wit,</a>
<a id='line_23779'>discretion to know good from evil, He hath given thee prowess and</a>
<a id='line_23780'>hardiness, and given thee to work so largely that thou hast had at all</a>
<a id='line_23781'>days the better wheresomever thou came; and now Our Lord will suffer</a>
<a id='line_23782'>thee no longer, but that thou shalt know Him whether thou wilt or nylt.</a>
<a id='line_23783'>And why the voice called thee bitterer than wood, for where overmuch</a>
<a id='line_23784'>sin dwelleth, there may be but little sweetness, wherefore thou art</a>
<a id='line_23785'>likened to an old rotten tree.</a>
<a id='line_23786'></a>
<a id='line_23787'>Now have I shewed thee why thou art harder than the stone and bitterer</a>
<a id='line_23788'>than the tree. Now shall I shew thee why thou art more naked and barer</a>
<a id='line_23789'>than the fig tree. It befell that Our Lord on Palm Sunday preached in</a>
<a id='line_23790'>Jerusalem, and there He found in the people that all hardness was</a>
<a id='line_23791'>harboured in them, and there He found in all the town not one that</a>
<a id='line_23792'>would harbour him. And then He went without the town, and found in</a>
<a id='line_23793'>midst of the way a fig tree, the which was right fair and well</a>
<a id='line_23794'>garnished of leaves, but fruit had it none. Then Our Lord cursed the</a>
<a id='line_23795'>tree that bare no fruit; that betokeneth the fig tree unto Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_23796'>that had leaves and no fruit. So thou, Sir Launcelot, when the Holy</a>
<a id='line_23797'>Grail was brought afore thee, He found in thee no fruit, nor good</a>
<a id='line_23798'>thought nor good will, and defouled with lechery. Certes, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_23799'>Launcelot, all that you have said is true, and from henceforward I cast</a>
<a id='line_23800'>me, by the grace of God, never to be so wicked as I have been, but as</a>
<a id='line_23801'>to follow knighthood and to do feats of arms.</a>
<a id='line_23802'></a>
<a id='line_23803'>Then the good man enjoined Sir Launcelot such penance as he might do</a>
<a id='line_23804'>and to sewe knighthood, and so assoiled him, and prayed Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_23805'>to abide with him all that day. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, for I</a>
<a id='line_23806'>have neither helm, nor horse, nor sword. As for that, said the good</a>
<a id='line_23807'>man, I shall help you or to-morn at even of an horse, and all that</a>
<a id='line_23808'>longed unto you. And then Sir Launcelot repented him greatly.</a>

<a id='line_23821'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Percivale came to a recluse and asked counsel, and</a>
<a id='line_23822'>how she told him that she was his aunt.</a>
<a id='line_23823'></a>
<a id='line_23824'></a>
<a id='line_23825'>Now saith the tale, that when Sir Launcelot was ridden after Sir</a>
<a id='line_23826'>Galahad, the which had all these adventures above said, Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_23827'>turned again unto the recluse, where he deemed to have tidings of that</a>
<a id='line_23828'>knight that Launcelot followed. And so he kneeled at her window, and</a>
<a id='line_23829'>the recluse opened it and asked Sir Percivale what he would. Madam, he</a>
<a id='line_23830'>said, I am a knight of King Arthur’s court, and my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_23831'>Percivale de Galis. When the recluse heard his name she had great joy</a>
<a id='line_23832'>of him, for mickle she had loved him to-fore any other knight, for she</a>
<a id='line_23833'>ought to do so, for she was his aunt. And then she commanded the gates</a>
<a id='line_23834'>to be opened, and there he had all the cheer that she might make him,</a>
<a id='line_23835'>and all that was in her power was at his commandment.</a>
<a id='line_23836'></a>
<a id='line_23837'>So on the morn Sir Percivale went to the recluse and asked her if she</a>
<a id='line_23838'>knew that knight with the white shield. Sir, said she, why would ye</a>
<a id='line_23839'>wit? Truly, madam, said Sir Percivale, I shall never be well at ease</a>
<a id='line_23840'>till that I know of that knight’s fellowship, and that I may fight with</a>
<a id='line_23841'>him, for I may not leave him so lightly, for I have the shame yet. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_23842'>Percivale, said she, would ye fight with him? I see well ye have great</a>
<a id='line_23843'>will to be slain as your father was, through outrageousness. Madam,</a>
<a id='line_23844'>said Sir Percivale, it seemeth by your words that ye know me. Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_23845'>she, I well ought to know you, for I am your aunt, although I be in a</a>
<a id='line_23846'>priory place. For some called me sometime the Queen of the Waste Lands,</a>
<a id='line_23847'>and I was called the queen of most riches in the world; and it pleased</a>
<a id='line_23848'>me never my riches so much as doth my poverty. Then Sir Percivale wept</a>
<a id='line_23849'>for very pity when that he knew it was his aunt. Ah, fair nephew, said</a>
<a id='line_23850'>she, when heard ye tidings of your mother? Truly, said he, I heard none</a>
<a id='line_23851'>of her, but I dream of her much in my sleep; and therefore I wot not</a>
<a id='line_23852'>whether she be dead or alive. Certes, fair nephew, said she, your</a>
<a id='line_23853'>mother is dead, for after your departing from her she took such a</a>
<a id='line_23854'>sorrow that anon, after she was confessed, she died. Now, God have</a>
<a id='line_23855'>mercy on her soul, said Sir Percivale, it sore forthinketh me; but all</a>
<a id='line_23856'>we must change the life. Now, fair aunt, tell me what is the knight? I</a>
<a id='line_23857'>deem it be he that bare the red arms on Whitsunday. Wit you well, said</a>
<a id='line_23858'>she, that this is he, for otherwise ought he not to do, but to go in</a>
<a id='line_23859'>red arms; and that same knight hath no peer, for he worketh all by</a>
<a id='line_23860'>miracle, and he shall never be overcome of none earthly man’s hand.</a>

<a id='line_23865'>CHAPTER II. How Merlin likened the Round Table to the world, and how</a>
<a id='line_23866'>the knights that should achieve the Sangreal should be known.</a>
<a id='line_23867'></a>
<a id='line_23868'></a>
<a id='line_23869'>Also Merlin made the Round Table in tokening of roundness of the world,</a>
<a id='line_23870'>for by the Round Table is the world signified by right, for all the</a>
<a id='line_23871'>world, Christian and heathen, repair unto the Round Table; and when</a>
<a id='line_23872'>they are chosen to be of the fellowship of the Round Table they think</a>
<a id='line_23873'>them more blessed and more in worship than if they had gotten half the</a>
<a id='line_23874'>world; and ye have seen that they have lost their fathers and their</a>
<a id='line_23875'>mothers, and all their kin, and their wives and their children, for to</a>
<a id='line_23876'>be of your fellowship. It is well seen by you; for since ye have</a>
<a id='line_23877'>departed from your mother ye would never see her, ye found such</a>
<a id='line_23878'>fellowship at the Round Table. When Merlin had ordained the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_23879'>he said, by them which should be fellows of the Round Table the truth</a>
<a id='line_23880'>of the Sangreal should be well known. And men asked him how men might</a>
<a id='line_23881'>know them that should best do and to enchieve the Sangreal? Then he</a>
<a id='line_23882'>said there should be three white bulls that should enchieve it, and the</a>
<a id='line_23883'>two should be maidens, and the third should be chaste. And that one of</a>
<a id='line_23884'>the three should pass his father as much as the lion passeth the</a>
<a id='line_23885'>leopard, both of strength and hardiness.</a>
<a id='line_23886'></a>
<a id='line_23887'>They that heard Merlin say so said thus unto Merlin: Sithen there shall</a>
<a id='line_23888'>be such a knight, thou shouldest ordain by thy crafts a siege, that no</a>
<a id='line_23889'>man should sit in it but he all only that shall pass all other knights.</a>
<a id='line_23890'>Then Merlin answered that he would do so. And then he made the Siege</a>
<a id='line_23891'>Perilous, in the which Galahad sat in at his meat on Whitsunday last</a>
<a id='line_23892'>past. Now, madam, said Sir Percivale, so much have I heard of you that</a>
<a id='line_23893'>by my good will I will never have ado with Sir Galahad but by way of</a>
<a id='line_23894'>kindness; and for God’s love, fair aunt, can ye teach me some way where</a>
<a id='line_23895'>I may find him? for much would I love the fellowship of him. Fair</a>
<a id='line_23896'>nephew, said she, ye must ride unto a castle the which is called</a>
<a id='line_23897'>Goothe, where he hath a cousin-germain, and there may ye be lodged this</a>
<a id='line_23898'>night. And as he teacheth you, seweth after as fast as ye can; and if</a>
<a id='line_23899'>he can tell you no tidings of him, ride straight unto the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_23900'>Carbonek, where the maimed king is there lying, for there shall ye hear</a>
<a id='line_23901'>true tidings of him.</a>
<a id='line_23902'></a>

<a id='line_23904'></a>
<a id='line_23905'></a>
<a id='line_23906'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Percivale came into a monastery, where he found</a>
<a id='line_23907'>King Evelake, which was an old man.</a>
<a id='line_23908'></a>
<a id='line_23909'></a>
<a id='line_23910'>Then departed Sir Percivale from his aunt, either making great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_23911'>And so he rode till evensong time. And then he heard a clock smite; and</a>
<a id='line_23912'>then he was ware of an house closed well with walls and deep ditches,</a>
<a id='line_23913'>and there he knocked at the gate and was let in, and he alighted and</a>
<a id='line_23914'>was led unto a chamber, and soon he was unarmed. And there he had right</a>
<a id='line_23915'>good cheer all that night; and on the morn he heard his mass, and in</a>
<a id='line_23916'>the monastery he found a priest ready at the altar. And on the right</a>
<a id='line_23917'>side he saw a pew closed with iron, and behind the altar he saw a rich</a>
<a id='line_23918'>bed and a fair, as of cloth of silk and gold.</a>
<a id='line_23919'></a>
<a id='line_23920'>Then Sir Percivale espied that therein was a man or a woman, for the</a>
<a id='line_23921'>visage was covered; then he left off his looking and heard his service.</a>
<a id='line_23922'>And when it came to the sacring, he that lay within that parclos</a>
<a id='line_23923'>dressed him up, and uncovered his head; and then him beseemed a passing</a>
<a id='line_23924'>old man, and he had a crown of gold upon his head, and his shoulders</a>
<a id='line_23925'>were naked and unhilled unto his navel. And then Sir Percivale espied</a>
<a id='line_23926'>his body was full of great wounds, both on the shoulders, arms, and</a>
<a id='line_23927'>visage. And ever he held up his hands against Our Lord’s body, and</a>
<a id='line_23928'>cried: Fair, sweet Father, Jesu Christ, forget not me. And so he lay</a>
<a id='line_23929'>down, but always he was in his prayers and orisons; and him seemed to</a>
<a id='line_23930'>be of the age of three hundred winter. And when the mass was done the</a>
<a id='line_23931'>priest took Our Lord’s body and bare it to the sick king. And when he</a>
<a id='line_23932'>had used it he did off his crown, and commanded the crown to be set on</a>
<a id='line_23933'>the altar.</a>
<a id='line_23934'></a>
<a id='line_23935'>Then Sir Percivale asked one of the brethren what he was. Sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_23936'>good man, ye have heard much of Joseph of Aramathie, how he was sent by</a>
<a id='line_23937'>Jesu Christ into this land for to teach and preach the holy Christian</a>
<a id='line_23938'>faith; and therefore he suffered many persecutions the which the</a>
<a id='line_23939'>enemies of Christ did unto him, and in the city of Sarras he converted</a>
<a id='line_23940'>a king whose name was Evelake. And so this king came with Joseph into</a>
<a id='line_23941'>this land, and ever he was busy to be thereas the Sangreal was; and on</a>
<a id='line_23942'>a time he nighed it so nigh that Our Lord was displeased with him, but</a>
<a id='line_23943'>ever he followed it more and more, till God struck him almost blind.</a>
<a id='line_23944'>Then this king cried mercy, and said: Fair Lord, let me never die till</a>
<a id='line_23945'>the good knight of my blood of the ninth degree be come, that I may see</a>
<a id='line_23946'>him openly that he shall enchieve the Sangreal, that I may kiss him.</a>
<a id='line_23947'></a>
<a id='line_23948'></a>
<a id='line_23949'></a>
<a id='line_23950'></a>
<a id='line_23951'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Percivale saw many men of arms bearing a dead</a>
<a id='line_23952'>knight, and how he fought against them.</a>
<a id='line_23953'></a>
<a id='line_23954'></a>
<a id='line_23955'>When the king thus had made his prayers he heard a voice that said:</a>
<a id='line_23956'>Heard be thy prayers, for thou shalt not die till he have kissed thee.</a>
<a id='line_23957'>And when that knight shall come the clearness of your eyes shall come</a>
<a id='line_23958'>again, and thou shalt see openly, and thy wounds shall be healed, and</a>
<a id='line_23959'>erst shall they never close. And this befell of King Evelake, and this</a>
<a id='line_23960'>same king hath lived this three hundred winters this holy life, and men</a>
<a id='line_23961'>say the knight is in the court that shall heal him. Sir, said the good</a>
<a id='line_23962'>man, I pray you tell me what knight that ye be, and if ye be of King</a>
<a id='line_23963'>Arthur’s court and of the Table Round. Yea forsooth, said he, and my</a>
<a id='line_23964'>name is Sir Percivale de Galis. And when the good man understood his</a>
<a id='line_23965'>name he made great joy of him.</a>
<a id='line_23966'></a>
<a id='line_23967'>And then Sir Percivale departed and rode till the hour of noon. And he</a>
<a id='line_23968'>met in a valley about a twenty men of arms, which bare in a bier a</a>
<a id='line_23969'>knight deadly slain. And when they saw Sir Percivale they asked him of</a>
<a id='line_23970'>whence he was. And he answered: Of the court of King Arthur. Then they</a>
<a id='line_23971'>cried all at once: Slay him. Then Sir Percivale smote the first to the</a>
<a id='line_23972'>earth and his horse upon him. And then seven of the knights smote upon</a>
<a id='line_23973'>his shield all at once, and the remnant slew his horse so that he fell</a>
<a id='line_23974'>to the earth. So had they slain him or taken him had not the good</a>
<a id='line_23975'>knight, Sir Galahad, with the red arms come there by adventure into</a>
<a id='line_23976'>those parts. And when he saw all those knights upon one knight he</a>
<a id='line_23977'>cried: Save me that knight’s life. And then he dressed him toward the</a>
<a id='line_23978'>twenty men of arms as fast as his horse might drive, with his spear in</a>
<a id='line_23979'>the rest, and smote the foremost horse and man to the earth. And when</a>
<a id='line_23980'>his spear was broken he set his hand to his sword, and smote on the</a>
<a id='line_23981'>right hand and on the left hand that it was marvel to see, and at every</a>
<a id='line_23982'>stroke he smote one down or put him to a rebuke, so that they would</a>
<a id='line_23983'>fight no more but fled to a thick forest, and Sir Galahad followed</a>
<a id='line_23984'>them.</a>
<a id='line_23985'></a>
<a id='line_23986'>And when Sir Percivale saw him chase them so, he made great sorrow that</a>
<a id='line_23987'>his horse was away. And then he wist well it was Sir Galahad. And then</a>
<a id='line_23988'>he cried aloud: Ah fair knight, abide and suffer me to do thankings</a>
<a id='line_23989'>unto thee, for much have ye done for me. But ever Sir Galahad rode so</a>
<a id='line_23990'>fast that at the last he passed out of his sight. And as fast as Sir</a>
<a id='line_23991'>Percivale might he went after him on foot, crying. And then he met with</a>
<a id='line_23992'>a yeoman riding upon an hackney, the which led in his hand a great</a>
<a id='line_23993'>steed blacker than any bear. Ah, fair friend, said Sir Percivale, as</a>
<a id='line_23994'>ever I may do for you, and to be your true knight in the first place ye</a>
<a id='line_23995'>will require me, that ye will lend me that black steed, that I might</a>
<a id='line_23996'>overtake a knight the which rideth afore me. Sir knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_23997'>yeoman, I pray you hold me excused of that, for that I may not do. For</a>
<a id='line_23998'>wit ye well, the horse is such a man’s horse, that an I lent it you or</a>
<a id='line_23999'>any man, that he would slay me. Alas, said Sir Percivale, I had never</a>
<a id='line_24000'>so great sorrow as I have had for losing of yonder knight. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_24001'>the yeoman, I am right heavy for you, for a good horse would beseem you</a>
<a id='line_24002'>well; but I dare not deliver you this horse but if ye would take him</a>
<a id='line_24003'>from me. That will I not do, said Sir Percivale. And so they departed;</a>
<a id='line_24004'>and Sir Percivale set him down under a tree, and made sorrow out of</a>
<a id='line_24005'>measure. And as he was there, there came a knight riding on the horse</a>
<a id='line_24006'>that the yeoman led, and he was clean armed.</a>
<a id='line_24007'></a>
<a id='line_24008'></a>
<a id='line_24009'></a>
<a id='line_24010'></a>
<a id='line_24011'>CHAPTER V. How a yeoman desired him to get again an horse, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_24012'>Percivale’s hackney was slain, and how he gat an horse.</a>
<a id='line_24013'></a>
<a id='line_24014'></a>
<a id='line_24015'>And anon the yeoman came pricking after as fast as ever he might, and</a>
<a id='line_24016'>asked Sir Percivale if he saw any knight riding on his black steed.</a>
<a id='line_24017'>Yea, sir, forsooth, said he; why, sir, ask ye me that? Ah, sir, that</a>
<a id='line_24018'>steed he hath benome me with strength; wherefore my lord will slay me</a>
<a id='line_24019'>in what place he findeth me. Well, said Sir Percivale, what wouldst</a>
<a id='line_24020'>thou that I did? Thou seest well that I am on foot, but an I had a good</a>
<a id='line_24021'>horse I should bring him soon again. Sir, said the yeoman, take mine</a>
<a id='line_24022'>hackney and do the best ye can, and I shall sewe you on foot to wit how</a>
<a id='line_24023'>that ye shall speed. Then Sir Percivale alighted upon that hackney, and</a>
<a id='line_24024'>rode as fast as he might, and at the last he saw that knight. And then</a>
<a id='line_24025'>he cried: Knight, turn again; and he turned and set his spear against</a>
<a id='line_24026'>Sir Percivale, and he smote the hackney in the midst of the breast that</a>
<a id='line_24027'>he fell down dead to the earth, and there he had a great fall, and the</a>
<a id='line_24028'>other rode his way. And then Sir Percivale was wood wroth, and cried:</a>
<a id='line_24029'>Abide, wicked knight; coward and false-hearted knight, turn again and</a>
<a id='line_24030'>fight with me on foot. But he answered not, but passed on his way.</a>
<a id='line_24031'></a>
<a id='line_24032'>When Sir Percivale saw he would not turn he cast away his helm and</a>
<a id='line_24033'>sword, and said: Now am I a very wretch, cursed and most unhappy above</a>
<a id='line_24034'>all other knights. So in this sorrow he abode all that day till it was</a>
<a id='line_24035'>night; and then he was faint, and laid him down and slept till it was</a>
<a id='line_24036'>midnight; and then he awaked and saw afore him a woman which said unto</a>
<a id='line_24037'>him right fiercely: Sir Percivale, what dost thou here? He answered, I</a>
<a id='line_24038'>do neither good nor great ill. If thou wilt ensure me, said she, that</a>
<a id='line_24039'>thou wilt fulfil my will when I summon thee, I shall lend thee mine own</a>
<a id='line_24040'>horse which shall bear thee whither thou wilt. Sir Percivale was glad</a>
<a id='line_24041'>of her proffer, and ensured her to fulfil all her desire. Then abide me</a>
<a id='line_24042'>here, and I shall go and fetch you an horse. And so she came soon again</a>
<a id='line_24043'>and brought an horse with her that was inly black. When Percivale</a>
<a id='line_24044'>beheld that horse he marvelled that it was so great and so well</a>
<a id='line_24045'>apparelled; and not for then he was so hardy, and he leapt upon him,</a>
<a id='line_24046'>and took none heed of himself. And so anon as he was upon him he thrust</a>
<a id='line_24047'>to him with his spurs, and so he rode by a forest, and the moon shone</a>
<a id='line_24048'>clear. And within an hour and less he bare him four days’ journey</a>
<a id='line_24049'>thence, until he came to a rough water the which roared, and his horse</a>
<a id='line_24050'>would have borne him into it.</a>
<a id='line_24051'></a>
<a id='line_24052'></a>
<a id='line_24053'></a>
<a id='line_24054'></a>
<a id='line_24055'>CHAPTER VI. Of the great danger that Sir Percivale was in by his horse,</a>
<a id='line_24056'>and how he saw a serpent and a lion fight.</a>
<a id='line_24057'></a>
<a id='line_24058'></a>
<a id='line_24059'>And when Sir Percivale came nigh the brim, and saw the water so</a>
<a id='line_24060'>boistous, he doubted to overpass it. And then he made a sign of the</a>
<a id='line_24061'>cross in his forehead. When the fiend felt him so charged he shook off</a>
<a id='line_24062'>Sir Percivale, and he went into the water crying and roaring, making</a>
<a id='line_24063'>great sorrow, and it seemed unto him that the water brent. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_24064'>Percivale perceived it was a fiend, the which would have brought him</a>
<a id='line_24065'>unto his perdition. Then he commended himself unto God, and prayed Our</a>
<a id='line_24066'>Lord to keep him from all such temptations; and so he prayed all that</a>
<a id='line_24067'>night till on the morn that it was day; then he saw that he was in a</a>
<a id='line_24068'>wild mountain the which was closed with the sea nigh all about, that he</a>
<a id='line_24069'>might see no land about him which might relieve him, but wild beasts.</a>
<a id='line_24070'></a>
<a id='line_24071'>And then he went into a valley, and there he saw a young serpent bring</a>
<a id='line_24072'>a young lion by the neck, and so he came by Sir Percivale. With that</a>
<a id='line_24073'>came a great lion crying and roaring after the serpent. And as fast as</a>
<a id='line_24074'>Sir Percivale saw this he marvelled, and hied him thither, but anon the</a>
<a id='line_24075'>lion had overtaken the serpent and began battle with him. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_24076'>Percivale thought to help the lion, for he was the more natural beast</a>
<a id='line_24077'>of the two; and therewith he drew his sword, and set his shield afore</a>
<a id='line_24078'>him, and there he gave the serpent such a buffet that he had a deadly</a>
<a id='line_24079'>wound. When the lion saw that, he made no resemblaunt to fight with</a>
<a id='line_24080'>him, but made him all the cheer that a beast might make a man. Then</a>
<a id='line_24081'>Percivale perceived that, and cast down his shield which was broken;</a>
<a id='line_24082'>and then he did off his helm for to gather wind, for he was greatly</a>
<a id='line_24083'>enchafed with the serpent: and the lion went alway about him fawning as</a>
<a id='line_24084'>a spaniel. And then he stroked him on the neck and on the shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_24085'>And then he thanked God of the fellowship of that beast. And about noon</a>
<a id='line_24086'>the lion took his little whelp and trussed him and bare him there he</a>
<a id='line_24087'>came from.</a>
<a id='line_24088'></a>
<a id='line_24089'>Then was Sir Percivale alone. And as the tale telleth, he was one of</a>
<a id='line_24090'>the men of the world at that time which most believed in Our Lord Jesu</a>
<a id='line_24091'>Christ, for in those days there were but few folks that believed in God</a>
<a id='line_24092'>perfectly. For in those days the son spared not the father no more than</a>
<a id='line_24093'>a stranger. And so Sir Percivale comforted himself in our Lord Jesu,</a>
<a id='line_24094'>and besought God no temptation should bring him out of God’s service,</a>
<a id='line_24095'>but to endure as his true champion. Thus when Sir Percivale had prayed</a>
<a id='line_24096'>he saw the lion come toward him, and then he couched down at his feet.</a>
<a id='line_24097'>And so all that night the lion and he slept together; and when Sir</a>
<a id='line_24098'>Percivale slept he dreamed a marvellous dream, that there two ladies</a>
<a id='line_24099'>met with him, and that one sat upon a lion, and that other sat upon a</a>
<a id='line_24100'>serpent, and that one of them was young, and the other was old; and the</a>
<a id='line_24101'>youngest him thought said: Sir Percivale, my lord saluteth thee, and</a>
<a id='line_24102'>sendeth thee word that thou array thee and make thee ready, for to-morn</a>
<a id='line_24103'>thou must fight with the strongest champion of the world. And if thou</a>
<a id='line_24104'>be overcome thou shall not be quit for losing of any of thy members,</a>
<a id='line_24105'>but thou shalt be shamed for ever to the world’s end. And then he asked</a>
<a id='line_24106'>her what was her lord. And she said the greatest lord of all the world:</a>
<a id='line_24107'>and so she departed suddenly that he wist not where.</a>
<a id='line_24108'></a>
<a id='line_24109'></a>

<a id='line_24111'></a>
<a id='line_24112'>CHAPTER VII. Of the vision that Sir Percivale saw, and how his vision</a>
<a id='line_24113'>was expounded, and of his lion.</a>
<a id='line_24114'></a>
<a id='line_24115'></a>
<a id='line_24116'>Then came forth the other lady that rode upon the serpent, and she</a>
<a id='line_24117'>said: Sir Percivale, I complain me of you that ye have done unto me,</a>
<a id='line_24118'>and have not offended unto you. Certes, madam, he said, unto you nor no</a>
<a id='line_24119'>lady I never offended. Yes, said she, I shall tell you why. I have</a>
<a id='line_24120'>nourished in this place a great while a serpent, which served me a</a>
<a id='line_24121'>great while, and yesterday ye slew him as he gat his prey. Say me for</a>
<a id='line_24122'>what cause ye slew him, for the lion was not yours. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_24123'>Percivale, I know well the lion was not mine, but I did it for the lion</a>
<a id='line_24124'>is of more gentler nature than the serpent, and therefore I slew him;</a>
<a id='line_24125'>meseemeth I did not amiss against you. Madam, said he, what would ye</a>
<a id='line_24126'>that I did? I would, said she, for the amends of my beast that ye</a>
<a id='line_24127'>become my man. And then he answered: That will I not grant you. No,</a>
<a id='line_24128'>said she, truly ye were never but my servant sin ye received the homage</a>
<a id='line_24129'>of Our Lord Jesu Christ. Therefore, I ensure you in what place I may</a>
<a id='line_24130'>find you without keeping I shall take you, as he that sometime was my</a>
<a id='line_24131'>man. And so she departed from Sir Percivale and left him sleeping, the</a>
<a id='line_24132'>which was sore travailed of his advision. And on the morn he arose and</a>
<a id='line_24133'>blessed him, and he was passing feeble.</a>
<a id='line_24134'></a>
<a id='line_24135'>Then was Sir Percivale ware in the sea, and saw a ship come sailing</a>
<a id='line_24136'>toward him; and Sir Percivale went unto the ship and found it covered</a>
<a id='line_24137'>within and without with white samite. And at the board stood an old man</a>
<a id='line_24138'>clothed in a surplice, in likeness of a priest. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_24139'>Percivale, ye be welcome. God keep you, said the good man. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_24140'>the old man, of whence be ye? Sir, said Sir Percivale, I am of King</a>
<a id='line_24141'>Arthur’s court, and a knight of the Table Round, the which am in the</a>
<a id='line_24142'>quest of the Sangreal; and here am I in great duresse, and never like</a>
<a id='line_24143'>to escape out of this wilderness. Doubt not, said the good man, an ye</a>
<a id='line_24144'>be so true a knight as the order of chivalry requireth, and of heart as</a>
<a id='line_24145'>ye ought to be, ye should not doubt that none enemy should slay you.</a>
<a id='line_24146'>What are ye? said Sir Percivale. Sir, said the old man, I am of a</a>
<a id='line_24147'>strange country, and hither I come to comfort you.</a>
<a id='line_24148'></a>
<a id='line_24149'>Sir, said Sir Percivale, what signifieth my dream that I dreamed this</a>
<a id='line_24150'>night? And there he told him altogether: She which rode upon the lion</a>
<a id='line_24151'>betokeneth the new law of holy church, that is to understand, faith,</a>
<a id='line_24152'>good hope, belief, and baptism. For she seemed younger than the other</a>
<a id='line_24153'>it is great reason, for she was born in the resurrection and the</a>
<a id='line_24154'>passion of Our Lord Jesu Christ. And for great love she came to thee to</a>
<a id='line_24155'>warn thee of thy great battle that shall befall thee. With whom, said</a>
<a id='line_24156'>Sir Percivale, shall I fight? With the most champion of the world, said</a>
<a id='line_24157'>the old man; for as the lady said, but if thou quit thee well thou</a>
<a id='line_24158'>shalt not be quit by losing of one member, but thou shalt be shamed to</a>
<a id='line_24159'>the world’s end. And she that rode on the serpent signifieth the old</a>
<a id='line_24160'>law, and that serpent betokeneth a fiend. And why she blamed thee that</a>
<a id='line_24161'>thou slewest her servant, it betokeneth nothing; the serpent that thou</a>
<a id='line_24162'>slewest betokeneth the devil that thou rodest upon to the rock. And</a>
<a id='line_24163'>when thou madest a sign of the cross, there thou slewest him, and put</a>
<a id='line_24164'>away his power. And when she asked thee amends and to become her man,</a>
<a id='line_24165'>and thou saidst thou wouldst not, that was to make thee to believe on</a>
<a id='line_24166'>her and leave thy baptism. So he commanded Sir Percivale to depart, and</a>
<a id='line_24167'>so he leapt over the board and the ship, and all went away he wist not</a>
<a id='line_24168'>whither. Then he went up unto the rock and found the lion which always</a>
<a id='line_24169'>kept him fellowship, and he stroked him upon the back and had great joy</a>
<a id='line_24170'>of him.</a>
<a id='line_24171'></a>
<a id='line_24172'></a>
<a id='line_24173'></a>
<a id='line_24174'></a>
<a id='line_24175'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Percivale saw a ship coming to him-ward, and how</a>
<a id='line_24176'>the lady of the ship told him of her disheritance.</a>
<a id='line_24177'></a>
<a id='line_24178'></a>
<a id='line_24179'>By that Sir Percivale had abiden there till mid-day he saw a ship came</a>
<a id='line_24180'>rowing in the sea, as all the wind of the world had driven it. And so</a>
<a id='line_24181'>it drove under that rock. And when Sir Percivale saw this he hied him</a>
<a id='line_24182'>thither, and found the ship covered with silk more blacker than any</a>
<a id='line_24183'>bear, and therein was a gentlewoman of great beauty, and she was</a>
<a id='line_24184'>clothed richly that none might be better. And when she saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_24185'>Percivale she said: Who brought you in this wilderness where ye be</a>
<a id='line_24186'>never like to pass hence, for ye shall die here for hunger and</a>
<a id='line_24187'>mischief? Damosel, said Sir Percivale, I serve the best man of the</a>
<a id='line_24188'>world, and in his service he will not suffer me to die, for who that</a>
<a id='line_24189'>knocketh shall enter, and who that asketh shall have, and who that</a>
<a id='line_24190'>seeketh him he hideth him not. But then she said: Sir Percivale, wot ye</a>
<a id='line_24191'>what I am? Yea, said he. Now who taught you my name? said she. Now,</a>
<a id='line_24192'>said Sir Percivale, I know you better than ye ween. And I came out of</a>
<a id='line_24193'>the waste forest where I found the Red Knight with the white shield,</a>
<a id='line_24194'>said the damosel. Ah, damosel, said he, with that knight would I meet</a>
<a id='line_24195'>passing fain. Sir knight, said she, an ye will ensure me by the faith</a>
<a id='line_24196'>that ye owe unto knighthood that ye shall do my will what time I summon</a>
<a id='line_24197'>you, and I shall bring you unto that knight. Yea, said he, I shall</a>
<a id='line_24198'>promise you to fulfil your desire. Well, said she, now shall I tell</a>
<a id='line_24199'>you. I saw him in the forest chasing two knights unto a water, the</a>
<a id='line_24200'>which is called Mortaise; and they drove him into the water for dread</a>
<a id='line_24201'>of death, and the two knights passed over, and the Red Knight passed</a>
<a id='line_24202'>after, and there his horse was drenched, and he, through great</a>
<a id='line_24203'>strength, escaped unto the land: thus she told him, and Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_24204'>was passing glad thereof.</a>
<a id='line_24205'></a>
<a id='line_24206'>Then she asked him if he had ate any meat late. Nay, madam, truly I ate</a>
<a id='line_24207'>no meat nigh this three days, but late here I spake with a good man</a>
<a id='line_24208'>that fed me with his good words and holy, and refreshed me greatly. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_24209'>sir knight, said she, that same man is an enchanter and a multiplier of</a>
<a id='line_24210'>words. For an ye believe him ye shall plainly be shamed, and die in</a>
<a id='line_24211'>this rock for pure hunger, and be eaten with wild beasts; and ye be a</a>
<a id='line_24212'>young man and a goodly knight, and I shall help you an ye will. What</a>
<a id='line_24213'>are ye, said Sir Percivale, that proffered me thus great kindness? I</a>
<a id='line_24214'>am, said she, a gentlewoman that am disherited, which was sometime the</a>
<a id='line_24215'>richest woman of the world. Damosel, said Sir Percivale, who hath</a>
<a id='line_24216'>disherited you? for I have great pity of you. Sir, said she, I dwelled</a>
<a id='line_24217'>with the greatest man of the world, and he made me so fair and clear</a>
<a id='line_24218'>that there was none like me; and of that great beauty I had a little</a>
<a id='line_24219'>pride more than I ought to have had. Also I said a word that pleased</a>
<a id='line_24220'>him not. And then he would not suffer me to be any longer in his</a>
<a id='line_24221'>company, and so drove me from mine heritage, and so disherited me, and</a>
<a id='line_24222'>he had never pity of me nor of none of my council, nor of my court. And</a>
<a id='line_24223'>sithen, sir knight, it hath befallen me so, and through me and mine I</a>
<a id='line_24224'>have benome him many of his men, and made them to become my men. For</a>
<a id='line_24225'>they ask never nothing of me but I give it them, that and much more.</a>
<a id='line_24226'>Thus I and all my servants were against him night and day. Therefore I</a>
<a id='line_24227'>know now no good knight, nor no good man, but I get them on my side an</a>
<a id='line_24228'>I may. And for that I know that thou art a good knight, I beseech you</a>
<a id='line_24229'>to help me; and for ye be a fellow of the Round Table, wherefore ye</a>
<a id='line_24230'>ought not to fail no gentlewoman which is disherited, an she besought</a>
<a id='line_24231'>you of help.</a>
<a id='line_24232'></a>

<a id='line_24236'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Percivale promised her help, and how he required</a>
<a id='line_24237'>her of love, and how he was saved from the fiend.</a>
<a id='line_24238'></a>
<a id='line_24239'></a>
<a id='line_24240'>Then Sir Percivale promised her all the help that he might; and then</a>
<a id='line_24241'>she thanked him. And at that time the weather was hot. Then she called</a>
<a id='line_24242'>unto her a gentlewoman and bade her bring forth a pavilion; and so she</a>
<a id='line_24243'>did, and pight it upon the gravel. Sir, said she, now may ye rest you</a>
<a id='line_24244'>in this heat of the day. Then he thanked her, and she put off his helm</a>
<a id='line_24245'>and his shield, and there he slept a great while. And then he awoke and</a>
<a id='line_24246'>asked her if she had any meat, and she said: Yea, also ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_24247'>enough. And so there was set enough upon the table, and thereon so much</a>
<a id='line_24248'>that he had marvel, for there was all manner of meats that he could</a>
<a id='line_24249'>think on. Also he drank there the strongest wine that ever he drank,</a>
<a id='line_24250'>him thought, and therewith he was a little chafed more than he ought to</a>
<a id='line_24251'>be; with that he beheld the gentlewoman, and him thought she was the</a>
<a id='line_24252'>fairest creature that ever he saw. And then Sir Percivale proffered her</a>
<a id='line_24253'>love, and prayed her that she would be his. Then she refused him, in a</a>
<a id='line_24254'>manner, when he required her, for the cause he should be the more</a>
<a id='line_24255'>ardent on her, and ever he ceased not to pray her of love. And when she</a>
<a id='line_24256'>saw him well enchafed, then she said: Sir Percivale, wit you well I</a>
<a id='line_24257'>shall not fulfil your will but if ye swear from henceforth ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_24258'>my true servant, and to do nothing but that I shall command you. Will</a>
<a id='line_24259'>ye ensure me this as ye be a true knight? Yea, said he, fair lady, by</a>
<a id='line_24260'>the faith of my body. Well, said she, now shall ye do with me whatso it</a>
<a id='line_24261'>please you; and now wit ye well ye are the knight in the world that I</a>
<a id='line_24262'>have most desire to.</a>
<a id='line_24263'></a>
<a id='line_24264'>And then two squires were commanded to make a bed in midst of the</a>
<a id='line_24265'>pavilion. And anon she was unclothed and laid therein. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_24266'>Percivale laid him down by her naked; and by adventure and grace he saw</a>
<a id='line_24267'>his sword lie on the ground naked, in whose pommel was a red cross and</a>
<a id='line_24268'>the sign of the crucifix therein, and bethought him on his knighthood</a>
<a id='line_24269'>and his promise made to-forehand unto the good man; then he made a sign</a>
<a id='line_24270'>of the cross in his forehead, and therewith the pavilion turned</a>
<a id='line_24271'>up-so-down, and then it changed unto a smoke, and a black cloud, and</a>
<a id='line_24272'>then he was adread and cried aloud:</a>

<a id='line_24276'></a>
<a id='line_24277'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Percivale for penance rove himself through the</a>
<a id='line_24278'>thigh; and how she was known for the devil.</a>
<a id='line_24279'></a>
<a id='line_24280'></a>
<a id='line_24281'>Fair sweet Father, Jesu Christ, ne let me not be shamed, the which was</a>
<a id='line_24282'>nigh lost had not thy good grace been. And then he looked into a ship,</a>
<a id='line_24283'>and saw her enter therein, which said: Sir Percivale, ye have betrayed</a>
<a id='line_24284'>me. And so she went with the wind roaring and yelling, that it seemed</a>
<a id='line_24285'>all the water brent after her. Then Sir Percivale made great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_24286'>and drew his sword unto him, saying: Sithen my flesh will be my master</a>
<a id='line_24287'>I shall punish it; and therewith he rove himself through the thigh that</a>
<a id='line_24288'>the blood stert about him, and said: O good Lord, take this in</a>
<a id='line_24289'>recompensation of that I have done against thee, my Lord. So then he</a>
<a id='line_24290'>clothed him and armed him, and called himself a wretch, saying: How</a>
<a id='line_24291'>nigh was I lost, and to have lost that I should never have gotten</a>
<a id='line_24292'>again, that was my virginity, for that may never be recovered after it</a>
<a id='line_24293'>is once lost. And then he stopped his bleeding wound with a piece of</a>
<a id='line_24294'>his shirt.</a>
<a id='line_24295'></a>
<a id='line_24296'>Thus as he made his moan he saw the same ship come from Orient that the</a>
<a id='line_24297'>good man was in the day afore, and the noble knight was ashamed with</a>
<a id='line_24298'>himself, and therewith he fell in a swoon. And when he awoke he went</a>
<a id='line_24299'>unto him weakly, and there he saluted this good man. And then he asked</a>
<a id='line_24300'>Sir Percivale: How hast thou done sith I departed? Sir, said he, here</a>
<a id='line_24301'>was a gentlewoman and led me into deadly sin. And there he told him</a>
<a id='line_24302'>altogether. Knew ye not the maid? said the good man. Sir, said he, nay,</a>
<a id='line_24303'>but well I wot the fiend sent her hither to shame me. O good knight,</a>
<a id='line_24304'>said he, thou art a fool, for that gentlewoman was the master fiend of</a>
<a id='line_24305'>hell, the which hath power above all devils, and that was the old lady</a>
<a id='line_24306'>that thou sawest in thine advision riding on the serpent. Then he told</a>
<a id='line_24307'>Sir Percivale how our Lord Jesu Christ beat him out of heaven for his</a>
<a id='line_24308'>sin, the which was the most brightest angel of heaven, and therefore he</a>
<a id='line_24309'>lost his heritage. And that was the champion that thou foughtest</a>
<a id='line_24310'>withal, the which had overcome thee had not the grace of God been. Now</a>
<a id='line_24311'>beware Sir Percivale, and take this for an ensample. And then the good</a>
<a id='line_24312'>man vanished away. Then Sir Percivale took his arms, and entered into</a>
<a id='line_24313'>the ship, and so departed from thence.</a>

<a id='line_24329'></a>
<a id='line_24330'>When the hermit had kept Sir Launcelot three days, the hermit gat him</a>
<a id='line_24331'>an horse, an helm, and a sword. And then he departed about the hour of</a>
<a id='line_24332'>noon. And then he saw a little house. And when he came near he saw a</a>
<a id='line_24333'>chapel, and there beside he saw an old man that was clothed all in</a>
<a id='line_24334'>white full richly; and then Sir Launcelot said: God save you. God keep</a>
<a id='line_24335'>you, said the good man, and make you a good knight. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_24336'>alighted and entered into the chapel, and there he saw an old man dead,</a>
<a id='line_24337'>in a white shirt of passing fine cloth.</a>
<a id='line_24338'></a>
<a id='line_24339'>Sir, said the good man, this man that is dead ought not to be in such</a>
<a id='line_24340'>clothing as ye see him in, for in that he brake the oath of his order,</a>
<a id='line_24341'>for he hath been more than an hundred winter a man of a religion. And</a>
<a id='line_24342'>then the good man and Sir Launcelot went into the chapel; and the good</a>
<a id='line_24343'>man took a stole about his neck, and a book, and then he conjured on</a>
<a id='line_24344'>that book; and with that they saw in an hideous figure and horrible,</a>
<a id='line_24345'>that there was no man so hard-hearted nor so hard but he should have</a>
<a id='line_24346'>been afeard. Then said the fiend: Thou hast travailed me greatly; now</a>
<a id='line_24347'>tell me what thou wilt with me. I will, said the good man, that thou</a>
<a id='line_24348'>tell me how my fellow became dead, and whether he be saved or damned.</a>
<a id='line_24349'>Then he said with an horrible voice: He is not lost but saved. How may</a>
<a id='line_24350'>that be? said the good man; it seemed to me that he lived not well, for</a>
<a id='line_24351'>he brake his order for to wear a shirt where he ought to wear none, and</a>
<a id='line_24352'>who that trespasseth against our order doth not well. Not so, said the</a>
<a id='line_24353'>fiend, this man that lieth here dead was come of a great lineage. And</a>
<a id='line_24354'>there was a lord that hight the Earl de Vale, that held great war</a>
<a id='line_24355'>against this man’s nephew, the which hight Aguarus. And so this Aguarus</a>
<a id='line_24356'>saw the earl was bigger than he. Then he went for to take counsel of</a>
<a id='line_24357'>his uncle, the which lieth here dead as ye may see. And then he asked</a>
<a id='line_24358'>leave, and went out of his hermitage for to maintain his nephew against</a>
<a id='line_24359'>the mighty earl; and so it happed that this man that lieth here dead</a>
<a id='line_24360'>did so much by his wisdom and hardiness that the earl was taken, and</a>
<a id='line_24361'>three of his lords, by force of this dead man.</a>

<a id='line_24369'></a>
<a id='line_24370'>Then was there peace betwixt the earl and this Aguarus, and great</a>

<a id='line_24373'>two of his nephews for to be avenged upon this man. So they came on a</a>
<a id='line_24374'>day, and found this dead man at the sacring of his mass, and they abode</a>
<a id='line_24375'>him till he had said mass. And then they set upon him and drew out</a>
<a id='line_24376'>swords to have slain him; but there would no sword bite on him more</a>
<a id='line_24377'>than upon a gad of steel, for the high Lord which he served He him</a>
<a id='line_24378'>preserved. Then made they a great fire, and did off all his clothes,</a>
<a id='line_24379'>and the hair off his back. And then this dead man hermit said unto</a>
<a id='line_24380'>them: Ween you to burn me? It shall not lie in your power nor to perish</a>
<a id='line_24381'>me as much as a thread, an there were any on my body. No? said one of</a>
<a id='line_24382'>them, it shall be assayed. And then they despoiled him, and put upon</a>
<a id='line_24383'>him this shirt, and cast him in a fire, and there he lay all that night</a>
<a id='line_24384'>till it was day in that fire, and was not dead, and so in the morn I</a>
<a id='line_24385'>came and found him dead; but I found neither thread nor skin tamed, and</a>
<a id='line_24386'>so took him out of the fire with great fear, and laid him here as ye</a>
<a id='line_24387'>may see. And now may ye suffer me to go my way, for I have said you the</a>
<a id='line_24388'>sooth. And then he departed with a great tempest.</a>
<a id='line_24389'></a>
<a id='line_24390'>Then was the good man and Sir Launcelot more gladder than they were</a>
<a id='line_24391'>to-fore. And then Sir Launcelot dwelled with that good man that night.</a>
<a id='line_24392'>Sir, said the good man, be ye not Sir Launcelot du Lake? Yea, sir, said</a>
<a id='line_24393'>he. What seek ye in this country? Sir, said Sir Launcelot, I go to seek</a>
<a id='line_24394'>the adventures of the Sangreal. Well, said he, seek it ye may well, but</a>
<a id='line_24395'>though it were here ye shall have no power to see it no more than a</a>
<a id='line_24396'>blind man should see a bright sword, and that is long on your sin, and</a>
<a id='line_24397'>else ye were more abler than any man living. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_24398'>began to weep. Then said the good man: Were ye confessed sith ye</a>
<a id='line_24399'>entered into the quest of the Sangreal? Yea, sir, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_24400'>Then upon the morn when the good man had sung his mass, then they</a>
<a id='line_24401'>buried the dead man. Then Sir Launcelot said: Father, what shall I do?</a>
<a id='line_24402'>Now, said the good man, I require you take this hair that was this holy</a>
<a id='line_24403'>man’s and put it next thy skin, and it shall prevail thee greatly. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_24404'>and I will do it, said Sir Launcelot. Also I charge you that ye eat no</a>
<a id='line_24405'>flesh as long as ye be in the quest of the Sangreal, nor ye shall drink</a>
<a id='line_24406'>no wine, and that ye hear mass daily an ye may do it. So he took the</a>
<a id='line_24407'>hair and put it upon him, and so departed at evensong-time.</a>
<a id='line_24408'></a>
<a id='line_24409'>And so rode he into a forest, and there he met with a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_24410'>riding upon a white palfrey, and then she asked him: Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_24411'>whither ride ye? Certes, damosel, said Launcelot, I wot not whither I</a>
<a id='line_24412'>ride but as fortune leadeth me. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said she, I wot what</a>
<a id='line_24413'>adventure ye seek, for ye were afore time nearer than ye be now, and</a>
<a id='line_24414'>yet shall ye see it more openly than ever ye did, and that shall ye</a>
<a id='line_24415'>understand in short time. Then Sir Launcelot asked her where he might</a>
<a id='line_24416'>be harboured that night. Ye shall not find this day nor night, but</a>
<a id='line_24417'>to-morn ye shall find harbour good, and ease of that ye be in doubt of.</a>
<a id='line_24418'>And then he commended her unto God. Then he rode till that he came to a</a>
<a id='line_24419'>Cross, and took that for his host as for that night.</a>
<a id='line_24420'></a>
<a id='line_24421'></a>
<a id='line_24422'></a>
<a id='line_24423'></a>
<a id='line_24424'>CHAPTER III. Of an advision that Sir Launcelot had, and how he told it</a>
<a id='line_24425'>to an hermit, and desired counsel of him.</a>
<a id='line_24426'></a>
<a id='line_24427'></a>
<a id='line_24428'>And so he put his horse to pasture, and did off his helm and his</a>
<a id='line_24429'>shield, and made his prayers unto the Cross that he never fall in</a>
<a id='line_24430'>deadly sin again. And so he laid him down to sleep. And anon as he was</a>
<a id='line_24431'>asleep it befell him there an advision, that there came a man afore him</a>
<a id='line_24432'>all by compass of stars, and that man had a crown of gold on his head</a>
<a id='line_24433'>and that man led in his fellowship seven kings and two knights. And all</a>
<a id='line_24434'>these worshipped the Cross, kneeling upon their knees, holding up their</a>
<a id='line_24435'>hands toward the heaven. And all they said: Fair sweet Father of heaven</a>
<a id='line_24436'>come and visit us, and yield unto us everych as we have deserved.</a>
<a id='line_24437'></a>
<a id='line_24438'>Then looked Launcelot up to the heaven, and him seemed the clouds did</a>
<a id='line_24439'>open, and an old man came down, with a company of angels, and alighted</a>
<a id='line_24440'>among them, and gave unto everych his blessing, and called them his</a>
<a id='line_24441'>servants, and good and true knights. And when this old man had said</a>
<a id='line_24442'>thus he came to one of those knights, and said: I have lost all that I</a>
<a id='line_24443'>have set in thee, for thou hast ruled thee against me as a warrior, and</a>
<a id='line_24444'>used wrong wars with vain-glory, more for the pleasure of the world</a>
<a id='line_24445'>than to please me, therefore thou shalt be confounded without thou</a>
<a id='line_24446'>yield me my treasure. All this advision saw Sir Launcelot at the Cross.</a>
<a id='line_24447'></a>
<a id='line_24448'>And on the morn he took his horse and rode till mid-day; and there by</a>
<a id='line_24449'>adventure he met with the same knight that took his horse, helm, and</a>
<a id='line_24450'>his sword, when he slept when the Sangreal appeared afore the Cross.</a>
<a id='line_24451'>When Sir Launcelot saw him he saluted hin not fair, but cried on high:</a>
<a id='line_24452'>Knight, keep thee, for thou hast done to me great unkindness. And then</a>
<a id='line_24453'>they put afore them their spears, and Sir Launcelot came so fiercely</a>
<a id='line_24454'>upon him that he smote him and his horse down to the earth, that he had</a>
<a id='line_24455'>nigh broken his neck. Then Sir Launcelot took the knight’s horse that</a>
<a id='line_24456'>was his own aforehand, and descended from the horse he sat upon, and</a>
<a id='line_24457'>mounted upon his own horse, and tied the knight’s own horse to a tree,</a>
<a id='line_24458'>that he might find that horse when that he was arisen. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_24459'>Launcelot rode till night, and by adventure he met an hermit, and each</a>
<a id='line_24460'>of them saluted other; and there he rested with that good man all</a>
<a id='line_24461'>night, and gave his horse such as he might get. Then said the good man</a>
<a id='line_24462'>unto Launcelot: Of whence be ye? Sir, said he, I am of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_24463'>and my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake that am in the quest of the</a>
<a id='line_24464'>Sangreal, and therefore I pray you to counsel me of a vision the which</a>
<a id='line_24465'>I had at the Cross. And so he told him all.</a>
<a id='line_24466'></a>
<a id='line_24467'></a>
<a id='line_24468'></a>
<a id='line_24469'></a>
<a id='line_24470'>CHAPTER IV. How the hermit expounded to Sir Launcelot his advision, and</a>
<a id='line_24471'>told him that Sir Galahad was his son.</a>
<a id='line_24472'></a>
<a id='line_24473'></a>
<a id='line_24474'>Lo, Sir Launcelot, said the good man, there thou mightest understand</a>
<a id='line_24475'>the high lineage that thou art come of, and thine advision betokeneth.</a>
<a id='line_24476'>After the passion of Jesu Christ forty year, Joseph of Aramathie</a>
<a id='line_24477'>preached the victory of King Evelake, that he had in the battles the</a>
<a id='line_24478'>better of his enemies. And of the seven kings and the two knights: the</a>
<a id='line_24479'>first of them is called Nappus, an holy man; and the second hight</a>
<a id='line_24480'>Nacien, in remembrance of his grandsire, and in him dwelled our Lord</a>
<a id='line_24481'>Jesu Christ; and the third was called Helias le Grose; and the fourth</a>
<a id='line_24482'>hight Lisais; and the fifth hight Jonas, he departed out of his country</a>
<a id='line_24483'>and went into Wales, and took there the daughter of Manuel, whereby he</a>
<a id='line_24484'>had the land of Gaul, and he came to dwell in this country. And of him</a>
<a id='line_24485'>came King Launcelot thy grandsire, the which there wedded the king’s</a>
<a id='line_24486'>daughter of Ireland, and he was as worthy a man as thou art, and of him</a>
<a id='line_24487'>came King Ban, thy father, the which was the last of the seven kings.</a>
<a id='line_24488'>And by thee, Sir Launcelot, it signifieth that the angels said thou</a>
<a id='line_24489'>were none of the seven fellowships. And the last was the ninth knight,</a>
<a id='line_24490'>he was signified to a lion, for he should pass all manner of earthly</a>
<a id='line_24491'>knights, that is Sir Galahad, the which thou gat on King Pelles’</a>
<a id='line_24492'>daughter; and thou ought to thank God more than any other man living,</a>
<a id='line_24493'>for of a sinner earthly thou hast no peer as in knighthood, nor never</a>
<a id='line_24494'>shall be. But little thank hast thou given to God for all the great</a>
<a id='line_24495'>virtues that God hath lent thee. Sir, said Launcelot, ye say that that</a>
<a id='line_24496'>good knight is my son. That oughtest thou to know and no man better,</a>
<a id='line_24497'>said the good man, for thou knewest the daughter of King Pelles</a>
<a id='line_24498'>fleshly, and on her thou begattest Galahad, and that was he that at the</a>
<a id='line_24499'>feast of Pentecost sat in the Siege Perilous; and therefore make thou</a>
<a id='line_24500'>it known openly that he is one of thy begetting on King Pelles’</a>
<a id='line_24501'>daughter, for that will be your worship and honour, and to all thy</a>
<a id='line_24502'>kindred. And I counsel you in no place press not upon him to have ado</a>
<a id='line_24503'>with him. Well, said Launcelot, meseemeth that good knight should pray</a>
<a id='line_24504'>for me unto the High Father, that I fall not to sin again. Trust thou</a>
<a id='line_24505'>well, said the good man, thou farest mickle the better for his prayer;</a>
<a id='line_24506'>but the son shall not bear the wickedness of the father, nor the father</a>
<a id='line_24507'>shall not bear the wickedness of the son, but everych shall bear his</a>
<a id='line_24508'>own burden. And therefore beseek thou only God, and He will help thee</a>
<a id='line_24509'>in all thy needs. And then Sir Launcelot and he went to supper, and so</a>
<a id='line_24510'>laid him to rest, and the hair pricked so Sir Launcelot’s skin which</a>
<a id='line_24511'>grieved him full sore, but he took it meekly, and suffered the pain.</a>
<a id='line_24512'>And so on the morn he heard his mass and took his arms, and so took his</a>
<a id='line_24513'>leave.</a>
<a id='line_24514'></a>
<a id='line_24515'></a>
<a id='line_24516'></a>
<a id='line_24517'></a>
<a id='line_24518'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot jousted with many knights, and how he was</a>
<a id='line_24519'>taken.</a>
<a id='line_24520'></a>
<a id='line_24521'></a>
<a id='line_24522'>And then mounted upon his horse, and rode into a forest, and held no</a>
<a id='line_24523'>highway. And as he looked afore him he saw a fair plain, and beside</a>
<a id='line_24524'>that a fair castle, and afore the castle were many pavilions of silk</a>
<a id='line_24525'>and of diverse hue. And him seemed that he saw there five hundred</a>
<a id='line_24526'>knights riding on horseback; and there were two parties: they that were</a>
<a id='line_24527'>of the castle were all on black horses and their trappings black, and</a>
<a id='line_24528'>they that were without were all on white horses and trappings, and</a>
<a id='line_24529'>everych hurtled to other that it marvelled Sir Launcelot. And at the</a>
<a id='line_24530'>last him thought they of the castle were put to the worse.</a>
<a id='line_24531'></a>
<a id='line_24532'>Then thought Sir Launcelot for to help there the weaker party in</a>
<a id='line_24533'>increasing of his chivalry. And so Sir Launcelot thrust in among the</a>
<a id='line_24534'>party of the castle, and smote down a knight, horse and man, to the</a>
<a id='line_24535'>earth. And then he rashed here and there, and did marvellous deeds of</a>
<a id='line_24536'>arms. And then he drew out his sword, and struck many knights to the</a>
<a id='line_24537'>earth, so that all those that saw him marvelled that ever one knight</a>
<a id='line_24538'>might do so great deeds of arms.</a>
<a id='line_24539'></a>
<a id='line_24540'>But always the white knights held them nigh about Sir Launcelot, for to</a>
<a id='line_24541'>tire him and wind him. But at the last, as a man may not ever endure,</a>
<a id='line_24542'>Sir Launcelot waxed so faint of fighting and travailing, and was so</a>
<a id='line_24543'>weary of his great deeds, but he might not lift up his arms for to give</a>
<a id='line_24544'>one stroke, so that he weened never to have borne arms; and then they</a>
<a id='line_24545'>all took and led him away into a forest, and there made him to alight</a>
<a id='line_24546'>and to rest him.</a>
<a id='line_24547'></a>
<a id='line_24548'>And then all the fellowship of the castle were overcome for the default</a>
<a id='line_24549'>of him.</a>
<a id='line_24550'></a>
<a id='line_24551'>Then they said all unto Sir Launcelot: Blessed be God that ye be now of</a>
<a id='line_24552'>our fellowship, for we shall hold you in our prison; and so they left</a>
<a id='line_24553'>him with few words.</a>
<a id='line_24554'></a>
<a id='line_24555'>And then Sir Launcelot made great sorrow, For never or now was I never</a>
<a id='line_24556'>at tournament nor jousts but I had the best, and now I am shamed; and</a>
<a id='line_24557'>then he said: Now I am sure that I am more sinfuller than ever I was.</a>
<a id='line_24558'></a>
<a id='line_24559'>Thus he rode sorrowing, and half a day he was out of despair, till that</a>
<a id='line_24560'>he came into a deep valley. And when Sir Launcelot saw he might not</a>
<a id='line_24561'>ride up into the mountain, he there alighted under an apple tree, and</a>
<a id='line_24562'>there he left his helm and his shield, and put his horse unto pasture.</a>
<a id='line_24563'>And then he laid him down to sleep. And then him thought there came an</a>
<a id='line_24564'>old man afore him, the which said: Ah, Launcelot of evil faith and poor</a>
<a id='line_24565'>belief, wherefore is thy will turned so lightly toward thy deadly sin?</a>
<a id='line_24566'>And when he had said thus he vanished away, and Launcelot wist not</a>
<a id='line_24567'>where he was become. Then he took his horse, and armed him; and as he</a>
<a id='line_24568'>rode by the way he saw a chapel where was a recluse, which had a window</a>
<a id='line_24569'>that she might see up to the altar. And all aloud she called Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_24570'>for that he seemed a knight errant. And then he came, and she asked him</a>
<a id='line_24571'>what he was, and of what place, and where about he went to seek.</a>

<a id='line_24576'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot told his advision to a woman, and how she</a>
<a id='line_24577'>expounded it to him.</a>
<a id='line_24578'></a>
<a id='line_24579'></a>
<a id='line_24580'>And then he told her altogether word by word, and the truth how it</a>
<a id='line_24581'>befell him at the tournament. And after told her his advision that he</a>
<a id='line_24582'>had had that night in his sleep, and prayed her to tell him what it</a>
<a id='line_24583'>might mean, for he was not well content with it. Ah, Launcelot, said</a>
<a id='line_24584'>she, as long as ye were knight of earthly knighthood ye were the most</a>
<a id='line_24585'>marvellous man of the world, and most adventurous. Now, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_24586'>sithen ye be set among the knights of heavenly adventures, if adventure</a>
<a id='line_24587'>fell thee contrary at that tournament have thou no marvel, for that</a>
<a id='line_24588'>tournament yesterday was but a tokening of Our Lord. And not for then</a>
<a id='line_24589'>there was none enchantment, for they at the tournament were earthly</a>
<a id='line_24590'>knights. The tournament was a token to see who should have most</a>
<a id='line_24591'>knights, either Eliazar, the son of King Pelles, or Argustus, the son</a>
<a id='line_24592'>of King Harlon. But Eliazar was all clothed in white, and Argustus was</a>
<a id='line_24593'>covered in black, the which were [over]come.</a>
<a id='line_24594'></a>
<a id='line_24595'>All what this betokeneth I shall tell you. The day of Pentecost, when</a>
<a id='line_24596'>King Arthur held his court, it befell that earthly kings and knights</a>
<a id='line_24597'>took a tournament together, that is to say the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_24598'>The earthly knights were they the which were clothed all in black, and</a>
<a id='line_24599'>the covering betokeneth the sins whereof they be not confessed. And</a>
<a id='line_24600'>they with the covering of white betokeneth virginity, and they that</a>
<a id='line_24601'>chose chastity. And thus was the quest begun in them. Then thou beheld</a>
<a id='line_24602'>the sinners and the good men, and when thou sawest the sinners</a>
<a id='line_24603'>overcome, thou inclinest to that party for bobaunce and pride of the</a>
<a id='line_24604'>world, and all that must be left in that quest, for in this quest thou</a>
<a id='line_24605'>shalt have many fellows and thy betters. For thou art so feeble of evil</a>
<a id='line_24606'>trust and good belief, this made it when thou were there where they</a>
<a id='line_24607'>took thee and led thee into the forest. And anon there appeared the</a>
<a id='line_24608'>Sangreal unto the white knights, but thou was so feeble of good belief</a>
<a id='line_24609'>and faith that thou mightest not abide it for all the teaching of the</a>
<a id='line_24610'>good man, but anon thou turnest to the sinners, and that caused thy</a>
<a id='line_24611'>misadventure that thou should’st know good from evil and vain glory of</a>
<a id='line_24612'>the world, the which is not worth a pear. And for great pride thou</a>
<a id='line_24613'>madest great sorrow that thou hadst not overcome all the white knights</a>
<a id='line_24614'>with the covering of white, by whom was betokened virginity and</a>
<a id='line_24615'>chastity; and therefore God was wroth with you, for God loveth no such</a>
<a id='line_24616'>deeds in this quest. And this advision signifieth that thou were of</a>
<a id='line_24617'>evil faith and of poor belief, the which will make thee to fall into</a>
<a id='line_24618'>the deep pit of hell if thou keep thee not. Now have I warned thee of</a>
<a id='line_24619'>thy vain glory and of thy pride, that thou hast many times erred</a>
<a id='line_24620'>against thy Maker. Beware of everlasting pain, for of all earthly</a>
<a id='line_24621'>knights I have most pity of thee, for I know well thou hast not thy</a>
<a id='line_24622'>peer of any earthly sinful man.</a>
<a id='line_24623'></a>
<a id='line_24624'>And so she commended Sir Launcelot to dinner. And after dinner he took</a>
<a id='line_24625'>his horse and commended her to God, and so rode into a deep valley, and</a>
<a id='line_24626'>there he saw a river and an high mountain. And through the water he</a>
<a id='line_24627'>must needs pass, the which was hideous; and then in the name of God he</a>
<a id='line_24628'>took it with good heart. And when he came over he saw an armed knight,</a>
<a id='line_24629'>horse and man black as any bear; without any word he smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_24630'>Launcelot’s horse to the earth; and so he passed on, he wist not where</a>
<a id='line_24631'>he was become. And then he took his helm and his shield, and thanked</a>
<a id='line_24632'>God of his adventure.</a>

<a id='line_24646'>and of his marvellous dream.</a>
<a id='line_24647'></a>
<a id='line_24648'></a>
<a id='line_24649'>When Sir Gawaine was departed from his fellowship he rode long without</a>
<a id='line_24650'>any adventure. For he found not the tenth part of adventure as he was</a>
<a id='line_24651'>wont to do. For Sir Gawaine rode from Whitsuntide until Michaelmas and</a>
<a id='line_24652'>found none adventure that pleased him. So on a day it befell Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_24653'>met with Sir Ector de Maris, and either made great joy of other that it</a>
<a id='line_24654'>were marvel to tell. And so they told everych other, and complained</a>
<a id='line_24655'>them greatly that they could find none adventure. Truly, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_24656'>Gawaine unto Sir Ector, I am nigh weary of this quest, and loath I am</a>
<a id='line_24657'>to follow further in strange countries. One thing marvelled me, said</a>
<a id='line_24658'>Sir Ector, I have met with twenty knights, fellows of mine, and all</a>
<a id='line_24659'>they complain as I do. I have marvel, said Sir Gawaine, where that Sir</a>
<a id='line_24660'>Launcelot, your brother, is. Truly, said Sir Ector, I cannot hear of</a>
<a id='line_24661'>him, nor of Sir Galahad, Percivale, nor Sir Bors. Let them be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_24662'>Gawaine, for they four have no peers. And if one thing were not in Sir</a>
<a id='line_24663'>Launcelot he had no fellow of none earthly man; but he is as we be, but</a>
<a id='line_24664'>if he took more pain upon him. But an these four be met together they</a>
<a id='line_24665'>will be loath that any man meet with them; for an they fail of the</a>
<a id='line_24666'>Sangreal it is in waste of all the remnant to recover it.</a>
<a id='line_24667'></a>
<a id='line_24668'>Thus Ector and Gawaine rode more than eight days, and on a Saturday</a>
<a id='line_24669'>they found an old chapel, the which was wasted that there seemed no man</a>
<a id='line_24670'>thither repaired; and there they alighted, and set their spears at the</a>
<a id='line_24671'>door, and in they entered into the chapel, and there made their orisons</a>
<a id='line_24672'>a great while, and set them down in the sieges of the chapel. And as</a>
<a id='line_24673'>they spake of one thing and other, for heaviness they fell asleep, and</a>
<a id='line_24674'>there befell them both marvellous adventures. Sir Gawaine him seemed he</a>
<a id='line_24675'>came into a meadow full of herbs and flowers, and there he saw a rack</a>
<a id='line_24676'>of bulls, an hundred and fifty, that were proud and black, save three</a>
<a id='line_24677'>of them were all white, and one had a black spot, and the other two</a>
<a id='line_24678'>were so fair and so white that they might be no whiter. And these three</a>
<a id='line_24679'>bulls which were so fair were tied with two strong cords. And the</a>
<a id='line_24680'>remnant of the bulls said among them: Go we hence to seek better</a>
<a id='line_24681'>pasture. And so some went, and some came again, but they were so lean</a>
<a id='line_24682'>that they might not stand upright; and of the bulls that were so white,</a>
<a id='line_24683'>that one came again and no mo. But when this white bull was come again</a>
<a id='line_24684'>among these other there rose up a great cry for lack of wind that</a>
<a id='line_24685'>failed them; and so they departed one here and another there: this</a>
<a id='line_24686'>advision befell Gawaine that night.</a>
<a id='line_24687'></a>
<a id='line_24688'></a>
<a id='line_24689'></a>
<a id='line_24690'></a>
<a id='line_24691'>CHAPTER II. Of the advision of Sir Ector, and how he jousted with Sir</a>
<a id='line_24692'>Uwaine les Avoutres, his sworn brother.</a>
<a id='line_24693'></a>
<a id='line_24694'></a>
<a id='line_24695'>But to Ector de Maris befell another vision the contrary. For it seemed</a>
<a id='line_24696'>him that his brother, Sir Launcelot, and he alighted out of a chair and</a>
<a id='line_24697'>leapt upon two horses, and the one said to the other: Go we seek that</a>
<a id='line_24698'>we shall not find. And him thought that a man beat Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_24699'>despoiled him, and clothed him in another array, the which was all full</a>
<a id='line_24700'>of knots, and set him upon an ass, and so he rode till he came to the</a>
<a id='line_24701'>fairest well that ever he saw; and Sir Launcelot alighted and would</a>
<a id='line_24702'>have drunk of that well. And when he stooped to drink of the water the</a>
<a id='line_24703'>water sank from him. And when Sir Launcelot saw that, he turned and</a>
<a id='line_24704'>went thither as the head came from. And in the meanwhile he trowed that</a>
<a id='line_24705'>himself and Sir Ector rode till that they came to a rich man’s house</a>
<a id='line_24706'>where there was a wedding. And there he saw a king the which said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_24707'>knight, here is no place for you. And then he turned again unto the</a>
<a id='line_24708'>chair that he came from.</a>
<a id='line_24709'></a>
<a id='line_24710'>Thus within a while both Gawaine and Ector awaked, and either told</a>
<a id='line_24711'>other of their advision, the which marvelled them greatly. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_24712'>Ector, I shall never be merry till I hear tidings of my brother</a>
<a id='line_24713'>Launcelot. Now as they sat thus talking they saw an hand showing unto</a>
<a id='line_24714'>the elbow, and was covered with red samite, and upon that hung a bridle</a>
<a id='line_24715'>not right rich, and held within the fist a great candle which burned</a>
<a id='line_24716'>right clear, and so passed afore them, and entered into the chapel, and</a>
<a id='line_24717'>then vanished away and they wist not where. And anon came down a voice</a>
<a id='line_24718'>which said: Knights of full evil faith and of poor belief, these two</a>
<a id='line_24719'>things have failed you, and therefore ye may not come to the adventures</a>
<a id='line_24720'>of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_24721'></a>
<a id='line_24722'>Then first spake Gawaine and said: Ector, have ye heard these words?</a>
<a id='line_24723'>Yea truly, said Sir Ector, I heard all. Now go we, said Sir Ector, unto</a>
<a id='line_24724'>some hermit that will tell us of our advision, for it seemeth me we</a>
<a id='line_24725'>labour all in vain. And so they departed and rode into a valley, and</a>
<a id='line_24726'>there met with a squire which rode on an hackney, and they saluted him</a>
<a id='line_24727'>fair. Sir, said Gawaine, can thou teach us to any hermit? Here is one</a>
<a id='line_24728'>in a little mountain, but it is so rough there may no horse go thither,</a>
<a id='line_24729'>and therefore ye must go upon foot; there shall ye find a poor house,</a>
<a id='line_24730'>and there is Nacien the hermit, which is the holiest man in this</a>
<a id='line_24731'>country. And so they departed either from other.</a>
<a id='line_24732'></a>
<a id='line_24733'>And then in a valley they met with a knight all armed, which proffered</a>
<a id='line_24734'>them to joust as far as he saw them. In the name of God, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_24735'>Gawaine, sith I departed from Camelot there was none proffered me to</a>
<a id='line_24736'>joust but once. And now, sir, said Ector, let me joust with him. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_24737'>said Gawaine, ye shall not but if I be beat; it shall not for-think me</a>
<a id='line_24738'>then if ye go after me. And then either embraced other to joust and</a>
<a id='line_24739'>came together as fast as their horses might run, and brast their</a>
<a id='line_24740'>shields and the mails, and the one more than the other; and Gawaine was</a>
<a id='line_24741'>wounded in the left side, but the other knight was smitten through the</a>
<a id='line_24742'>breast, and the spear came out on the other side, and so they fell both</a>
<a id='line_24743'>out of their saddles, and in the falling they brake both their spears.</a>
<a id='line_24744'></a>
<a id='line_24745'>Anon Gawaine arose and set his hand to his sword, and cast his shield</a>
<a id='line_24746'>afore him. But all for naught was it, for the knight had no power to</a>
<a id='line_24747'>arise against him. Then said Gawaine: Ye must yield you as an overcome</a>
<a id='line_24748'>man, or else I may slay you. Ah, sir knight, said he, I am but dead,</a>
<a id='line_24749'>for God’s sake and of your gentleness lead me here unto an abbey that I</a>
<a id='line_24750'>may receive my Creator. Sir, said Gawaine, I know no house of religion</a>
<a id='line_24751'>hereby. Sir, said the knight, set me on an horse to-fore you, and I</a>
<a id='line_24752'>shall teach you. Gawaine set him up in the saddle, and he leapt up</a>
<a id='line_24753'>behind him for to sustain him, and so came to an abbey where they were</a>
<a id='line_24754'>well received; and anon he was unarmed, and received his Creator. Then</a>
<a id='line_24755'>he prayed Gawaine to draw out the truncheon of the spear out of his</a>
<a id='line_24756'>body. Then Gawaine asked him what he was, that knew him not. I am, said</a>
<a id='line_24757'>he, of King Arthur’s court, and was a fellow of the Round Table, and we</a>
<a id='line_24758'>were brethren sworn together; and now Sir Gawaine, thou hast slain me,</a>
<a id='line_24759'>and my name is Uwaine les Avoutres, that sometime was son unto King</a>
<a id='line_24760'>Uriens, and was in the quest of the Sangreal; and now forgive it thee</a>
<a id='line_24761'>God, for it shall ever be said that the one sworn brother hath slain</a>
<a id='line_24762'>the other.</a>
<a id='line_24763'></a>
<a id='line_24764'></a>
<a id='line_24765'></a>
<a id='line_24766'></a>
<a id='line_24767'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector came to an hermitage to be</a>
<a id='line_24768'>confessed, and how they told to the hermit their advisions.</a>
<a id='line_24769'></a>
<a id='line_24770'></a>
<a id='line_24771'>Alas, said Gawaine, that ever this misadventure is befallen me. No</a>
<a id='line_24772'>force, said Uwaine, sith I shall die this death, of a much more</a>
<a id='line_24773'>worshipfuller man’s hand might I not die; but when ye come to the court</a>
<a id='line_24774'>recommend me unto my lord, King Arthur, and all those that be left</a>
<a id='line_24775'>alive, and for old brotherhood think on me. Then began Gawaine to weep,</a>
<a id='line_24776'>and Ector also. And then Uwaine himself and Sir Gawaine drew out the</a>
<a id='line_24777'>truncheon of the spear, and anon departed the soul from the body. Then</a>
<a id='line_24778'>Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector buried him as men ought to bury a king’s son,</a>
<a id='line_24779'>and made write upon his name, and by whom he was slain.</a>
<a id='line_24780'></a>
<a id='line_24781'>Then departed Gawaine and Ector, as heavy as they might for their</a>
<a id='line_24782'>misadventure, and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain,</a>
<a id='line_24783'>and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And</a>
<a id='line_24784'>when they were come up they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a</a>
<a id='line_24785'>little courtelage, where Nacien the hermit gathered worts, as he which</a>
<a id='line_24786'>had tasted none other meat of a great while. And when he saw the errant</a>
<a id='line_24787'>knights he came toward them and saluted them, and they him again. Fair</a>
<a id='line_24788'>lords, said he, what adventure brought you hither? Sir, said Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_24789'>to speak with you for to be confessed. Sir, said the hermit, I am</a>
<a id='line_24790'>ready. Then they told him so much that he wist well what they were. And</a>
<a id='line_24791'>then he thought to counsel them if he might.</a>
<a id='line_24792'></a>
<a id='line_24793'>Then began Gawaine first and told him of his advision that he had had</a>
<a id='line_24794'>in the chapel, and Ector told him all as it is afore rehearsed. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_24795'>said the hermit unto Sir Gawaine, the fair meadow and the rack therein</a>
<a id='line_24796'>ought to be understood the Round Table, and by the meadow ought to be</a>
<a id='line_24797'>understood humility and patience, those be the things which be always</a>
<a id='line_24798'>green and quick; for men may no time overcome humility and patience,</a>
<a id='line_24799'>therefore was the Round Table founded, and the chivalry hath been at</a>
<a id='line_24800'>all times so by the fraternity which was there that she might not be</a>
<a id='line_24801'>overcome; for men said she was founded in patience and in humility. At</a>
<a id='line_24802'>the rack ate an hundred and fifty bulls; but they ate not in the</a>
<a id='line_24803'>meadow, for their hearts should be set in humility and patience, and</a>
<a id='line_24804'>the bulls were proud and black save only three. By the bulls is to</a>
<a id='line_24805'>understand the fellowship of the Round Table, which for their sin and</a>
<a id='line_24806'>their wickedness be black. Blackness is to say without good or virtuous</a>
<a id='line_24807'>works. And the three bulls which were white save only one that was</a>
<a id='line_24808'>spotted: the two white betoken Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale, for they</a>
<a id='line_24809'>be maidens clean and without spot; and the third that had a spot</a>
<a id='line_24810'>signifieth Sir Bors de Ganis, which trespassed but once in his</a>
<a id='line_24811'>virginity, but sithen he kept himself so well in chastity that all is</a>
<a id='line_24812'>forgiven him and his misdeeds. And why those three were tied by the</a>
<a id='line_24813'>necks, they be three knights in virginity and chastity, and there is no</a>
<a id='line_24814'>pride smitten in them. And the black bulls which said: Go we hence,</a>
<a id='line_24815'>they were those which at Pentecost at the high feast took upon them to</a>
<a id='line_24816'>go in the quest of the Sangreal without confession: they might not</a>
<a id='line_24817'>enter in the meadow of humility and patience. And therefore they</a>
<a id='line_24818'>returned into waste countries, that signifieth death, for there shall</a>
<a id='line_24819'>die many of them: everych of them shall slay other for sin, and they</a>
<a id='line_24820'>that shall escape shall be so lean that it shall be marvel to see them.</a>
<a id='line_24821'>And of the three bulls without spot, the one shall come again, and the</a>
<a id='line_24822'>other two never.</a>
<a id='line_24823'></a>
<a id='line_24824'></a>
<a id='line_24825'></a>
<a id='line_24826'></a>
<a id='line_24827'>CHAPTER IV. How the hermit expounded their advision.</a>
<a id='line_24828'></a>
<a id='line_24829'></a>
<a id='line_24830'>Then spake Nacien unto Ector: Sooth it is that Launcelot and ye came</a>
<a id='line_24831'>down off one chair: the chair betokeneth mastership and lordship which</a>
<a id='line_24832'>ye came down from. But ye two knights, said the hermit, ye go to seek</a>
<a id='line_24833'>that ye shall never find, that is the Sangreal; for it is the secret</a>
<a id='line_24834'>thing of our Lord Jesu Christ. What is to mean that Sir Launcelot fell</a>
<a id='line_24835'>down off his horse: he hath left pride and taken him to humility, for</a>
<a id='line_24836'>he hath cried mercy loud for his sin, and sore repented him, and our</a>
<a id='line_24837'>Lord hath clothed him in his clothing which is full of knots, that is</a>
<a id='line_24838'>the hair that he weareth daily. And the ass that he rode upon is a</a>
<a id='line_24839'>beast of humility, for God would not ride upon no steed, nor upon no</a>
<a id='line_24840'>palfrey; so in ensample that an ass betokeneth meekness, that thou</a>
<a id='line_24841'>sawest Sir Launcelot ride on in thy sleep. And the well whereas the</a>
<a id='line_24842'>water sank from him when he should have taken thereof, and when he saw</a>
<a id='line_24843'>he might not have it, he returned thither from whence he came, for the</a>
<a id='line_24844'>well betokeneth the high grace of God, the more men desire it to take</a>
<a id='line_24845'>it, the more shall be their desire. So when he came nigh the Sangreal,</a>
<a id='line_24846'>he meeked him that he held him not a man worthy to be so nigh the Holy</a>
<a id='line_24847'>Vessel, for he had been so defouled in deadly sin by the space of many</a>
<a id='line_24848'>years; yet when he kneeled to drink of the well, there he saw great</a>
<a id='line_24849'>providence of the Sangreal. And for he had served so long the devil, he</a>
<a id='line_24850'>shall have vengeance four-and-twenty days long, for that he hath been</a>
<a id='line_24851'>the devil’s servant four-and-twenty years. And then soon after he shall</a>
<a id='line_24852'>return unto Camelot out of this country, and he shall say a part of</a>
<a id='line_24853'>such things as he hath found.</a>
<a id='line_24854'></a>
<a id='line_24855'>Now will I tell you what betokeneth the hand with the candle and the</a>
<a id='line_24856'>bridle: that is to understand the Holy Ghost where charity is ever, and</a>
<a id='line_24857'>the bridle signifieth abstinence. For when she is bridled in Christian</a>
<a id='line_24858'>man’s heart she holdeth him so short that he falleth not in deadly sin.</a>
<a id='line_24859'>And the candle which sheweth clearness and sight signifieth the right</a>
<a id='line_24860'>way of Jesu Christ. And when he went and said: Knights of poor faith</a>
<a id='line_24861'>and of wicked belief, these three things failed, charity, abstinence,</a>
<a id='line_24862'>and truth; therefore ye may not attain that high adventure of the</a>
<a id='line_24863'>Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_24864'></a>

<a id='line_24868'>CHAPTER V. Of the good counsel that the hermit gave to them.</a>
<a id='line_24869'></a>
<a id='line_24870'></a>
<a id='line_24871'>Certes, said Gawaine, soothly have ye said, that I see it openly. Now,</a>
<a id='line_24872'>I pray you, good man and holy father, tell me why we met not with so</a>
<a id='line_24873'>many adventures as we were wont to do, and commonly have the better. I</a>
<a id='line_24874'>shall tell you gladly, said the good man; the adventure of the Sangreal</a>
<a id='line_24875'>which ye and many other have undertaken the quest of it and find it</a>
<a id='line_24876'>not, the cause is for it appeareth not to sinners. Wherefore marvel not</a>
<a id='line_24877'>though ye fail thereof, and many other. For ye be an untrue knight and</a>
<a id='line_24878'>a great murderer, and to good men signifieth other things than murder.</a>
<a id='line_24879'>For I dare say, as sinful as Sir Launcelot hath been, sith that he went</a>
<a id='line_24880'>into the quest of the Sangreal he slew never man, nor nought shall,</a>
<a id='line_24881'>till that he come unto Camelot again, for he hath taken upon him for to</a>
<a id='line_24882'>forsake sin. And nere that he nis not stable, but by his thought he is</a>
<a id='line_24883'>likely to turn again, he should be next to enchieve it save Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_24884'>his son. But God knoweth his thought and his unstableness, and yet</a>
<a id='line_24885'>shall he die right an holy man, and no doubt he hath no fellow of no</a>
<a id='line_24886'>earthly sinful man. Sir, said Gawaine, it seemeth me by your words that</a>
<a id='line_24887'>for our sins it will not avail us to travel in this quest. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_24888'>the good man, there be an hundred such as ye be that never shall</a>
<a id='line_24889'>prevail, but to have shame. And when they had heard these voices they</a>
<a id='line_24890'>commended him unto God.</a>
<a id='line_24891'></a>
<a id='line_24892'>Then the good man called Gawaine, and said: It is long time passed sith</a>
<a id='line_24893'>that ye were made knight, and never sithen thou servedst thy Maker, and</a>
<a id='line_24894'>now thou art so old a tree that in thee is neither life nor fruit;</a>
<a id='line_24895'>wherefore bethink thee that thou yield to Our Lord the bare rind, sith</a>
<a id='line_24896'>the fiend hath the leaves and the fruit. Sir, said Gawaine an I had</a>
<a id='line_24897'>leisure I would speak with you, but my fellow here, Sir Ector, is gone,</a>
<a id='line_24898'>and abideth me yonder beneath the hill. Well, said the good man, thou</a>
<a id='line_24899'>were better to be counselled. Then departed Gawaine and came to Ector,</a>
<a id='line_24900'>and so took their horses and rode till they came to a forester’s house,</a>
<a id='line_24901'>which harboured them right well. And on the morn they departed from</a>
<a id='line_24902'>their host, and rode long or they could find any adventure.</a>
<a id='line_24903'></a>

<a id='line_24906'></a>
<a id='line_24907'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Bors met with an hermit, and how he was confessed</a>
<a id='line_24908'>to him, and of his penance enjoined to him.</a>
<a id='line_24909'></a>
<a id='line_24910'></a>
<a id='line_24911'>When Bors was departed from Camelot he met with a religious man riding</a>
<a id='line_24912'>on an ass, and Sir Bors saluted him. Anon the good man knew him that he</a>
<a id='line_24913'>was one of the knights-errant that was in the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_24914'>What are ye? said the good man. Sir, said he, I am a knight that fain</a>
<a id='line_24915'>would be counselled in the quest of the Sangreal, for he shall have</a>
<a id='line_24916'>much earthly worship that may bring it to an end. Certes, said the good</a>
<a id='line_24917'>man, that is sooth, for he shall be the best knight of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_24918'>the fairest of all the fellowship. But wit you well there shall none</a>
<a id='line_24919'>attain it but by cleanness, that is pure confession.</a>
<a id='line_24920'></a>
<a id='line_24921'>So rode they together till that they came to an hermitage. And there he</a>
<a id='line_24922'>prayed Bors to dwell all that night with him. And so he alighted and</a>
<a id='line_24923'>put away his armour, and prayed him that he might be confessed; and so</a>
<a id='line_24924'>they went into the chapel, and there he was clean confessed, and they</a>
<a id='line_24925'>ate bread and drank water together. Now, said the good man, I pray thee</a>
<a id='line_24926'>that thou eat none other till that thou sit at the table where the</a>
<a id='line_24927'>Sangreal shall be. Sir, said he, I agree me thereto, but how wit ye</a>
<a id='line_24928'>that I shall sit there. Yes, said the good man, that know I, but there</a>
<a id='line_24929'>shall be but few of your fellows with you. All is welcome, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_24930'>Bors, that God sendeth me. Also, said the good man, instead of a shirt,</a>
<a id='line_24931'>and in sign of chastisement, ye shall wear a garment; therefore I pray</a>
<a id='line_24932'>you do off all your clothes and your shirt: and so he did. And then he</a>
<a id='line_24933'>took him a scarlet coat, so that should be instead of his shirt till he</a>
<a id='line_24934'>had fulfilled the quest of the Sangreal; and the good man found in him</a>
<a id='line_24935'>so marvellous a life and so stable, that he marvelled and felt that he</a>
<a id='line_24936'>was never corrupt in fleshly lusts, but in one time that he begat Elian</a>
<a id='line_24937'>le Blank.</a>
<a id='line_24938'></a>
<a id='line_24939'>Then he armed him, and took his leave, and so departed. And so a little</a>
<a id='line_24940'>from thence he looked up into a tree, and there he saw a passing great</a>
<a id='line_24941'>bird upon an old tree, and it was passing dry, without leaves; and the</a>
<a id='line_24942'>bird sat above, and had birds, the which were dead for hunger. So smote</a>
<a id='line_24943'>he himself with his beak, the which was great and sharp. And so the</a>
<a id='line_24944'>great bird bled till that he died among his birds. And the young birds</a>
<a id='line_24945'>took the life by the blood of the great bird. When Bors saw this he</a>
<a id='line_24946'>wist well it was a great tokening; for when he saw the great bird arose</a>
<a id='line_24947'>not, then he took his horse and yede his way. So by evensong, by</a>
<a id='line_24948'>adventure he came to a strong tower and an high, and there was he</a>
<a id='line_24949'>lodged gladly.</a>
<a id='line_24950'></a>

<a id='line_24954'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Bors was lodged with a lady, and how he took upon</a>
<a id='line_24955'>him for to fight against a champion for her land.</a>
<a id='line_24956'></a>
<a id='line_24957'></a>
<a id='line_24958'>And when he was unarmed they led him into an high tower where was a</a>
<a id='line_24959'>lady, young, lusty, and fair. And she received him with great joy, and</a>
<a id='line_24960'>made him to sit down by her, and so was he set to sup with flesh and</a>
<a id='line_24961'>many dainties. And when Sir Bors saw that, he bethought him on his</a>
<a id='line_24962'>penance, and bade a squire to bring him water. And so he brought him,</a>
<a id='line_24963'>and he made sops therein and ate them. Ah, said the lady, I trow ye</a>
<a id='line_24964'>like not my meat. Yes, truly, said Sir Bors, God thank you, madam, but</a>
<a id='line_24965'>I may eat none other meat this day. Then she spake no more as at that</a>
<a id='line_24966'>time, for she was loath to displease him. Then after supper they spake</a>
<a id='line_24967'>of one thing and other.</a>
<a id='line_24968'></a>
<a id='line_24969'>With that came a squire and said: Madam, ye must purvey you to-morn for</a>
<a id='line_24970'>a champion, for else your sister will have this castle and also your</a>
<a id='line_24971'>lands, except ye can find a knight that will fight to-morn in your</a>
<a id='line_24972'>quarrel against Pridam le Noire. Then she made sorrow and said: Ah,</a>
<a id='line_24973'>Lord God, wherefore granted ye to hold my land, whereof I should now be</a>
<a id='line_24974'>disherited without reason and right? And when Sir Bors had heard her</a>
<a id='line_24975'>say thus, he said: I shall comfort you. Sir, said she, I shall tell you</a>
<a id='line_24976'>there was here a king that hight Aniause, which held all this land in</a>
<a id='line_24977'>his keeping. So it mishapped he loved a gentlewoman a great deal elder</a>
<a id='line_24978'>than I. So took he her all this land to her keeping, and all his men to</a>
<a id='line_24979'>govern; and she brought up many evil customs whereby she put to death a</a>
<a id='line_24980'>great part of his kinsmen. And when he saw that, he let chase her out</a>
<a id='line_24981'>of this land, and betook it me, and all this land in my demesnes. But</a>
<a id='line_24982'>anon as that worthy king was dead, this other lady began to war upon</a>
<a id='line_24983'>me, and hath destroyed many of my men, and turned them against me, that</a>
<a id='line_24984'>I have well-nigh no man left me; and I have nought else but this high</a>
<a id='line_24985'>tower that she left me. And yet she hath promised me to have this</a>
<a id='line_24986'>tower, without I can find a knight to fight with her champion.</a>
<a id='line_24987'></a>
<a id='line_24988'>Now tell me, said Sir Bors, what is that Pridam le Noire? Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_24989'>she, he is the most doubted man of this land. Now may ye send her word</a>
<a id='line_24990'>that ye have found a knight that shall fight with that Pridam le Noire</a>
<a id='line_24991'>in God’s quarrel and yours. Then that lady was not a little glad, and</a>
<a id='line_24992'>sent word that she was purveyed, and that night Bors had good cheer;</a>
<a id='line_24993'>but in no bed he would come, but laid him on the floor, nor never would</a>
<a id='line_24994'>do otherwise till that he had met with the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_24995'></a>

<a id='line_24997'></a>
<a id='line_24998'></a>
<a id='line_24999'>CHAPTER VIII. Of an advision which Sir Bors had that night, and how he</a>
<a id='line_25000'>fought and overcame his adversary.</a>
<a id='line_25001'></a>
<a id='line_25002'></a>
<a id='line_25003'>And anon as he was asleep him befell a vision, that there came to him</a>
<a id='line_25004'>two birds, the one as white as a swan, and the other was marvellous</a>
<a id='line_25005'>black; but it was not so great as the other, but in the likeness of a</a>
<a id='line_25006'>Raven. Then the white bird came to him, and said: An thou wouldst give</a>
<a id='line_25007'>me meat and serve me I should give thee all the riches of the world,</a>
<a id='line_25008'>and I shall make thee as fair and as white as I am. So the white bird</a>
<a id='line_25009'>departed, and there came the black bird to him, and said: An thou wolt,</a>
<a id='line_25010'>serve me to-morrow and have me in no despite though I be black, for wit</a>
<a id='line_25011'>thou well that more availeth my blackness than the other’s whiteness.</a>
<a id='line_25012'>And then he departed.</a>
<a id='line_25013'></a>
<a id='line_25014'>And he had another vision: him thought that he came to a great place</a>
<a id='line_25015'>which seemed a chapel, and there he found a chair set on the left side,</a>
<a id='line_25016'>which was worm-eaten and feeble. And on the right hand were two flowers</a>
<a id='line_25017'>like a lily, and the one would have benome the other’s whiteness, but a</a>
<a id='line_25018'>good man departed them that the one touched not the other; and then out</a>
<a id='line_25019'>of every flower came out many flowers, and fruit great plenty. Then him</a>
<a id='line_25020'>thought the good man said: Should not he do great folly that would let</a>
<a id='line_25021'>these two flowers perish for to succour the rotten tree, that it fell</a>
<a id='line_25022'>not to the earth? Sir, said he, it seemeth me that this wood might not</a>
<a id='line_25023'>avail. Now keep thee, said the good man, that thou never see such</a>
<a id='line_25024'>adventure befall thee.</a>
<a id='line_25025'></a>
<a id='line_25026'>Then he awaked and made a sign of the cross in midst of the forehead,</a>
<a id='line_25027'>and so rose and clothed him. And there came the lady of the place, and</a>
<a id='line_25028'>she saluted him, and he her again, and so went to a chapel and heard</a>
<a id='line_25029'>their service. And there came a company of knights, that the lady had</a>
<a id='line_25030'>sent for, to lead Sir Bors unto battle. Then asked he his arms. And</a>
<a id='line_25031'>when he was armed she prayed him to take a little morsel to dine. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_25032'>madam, said he, that shall I not do till I have done my battle, by the</a>
<a id='line_25033'>grace of God. And so he leapt upon his horse, and departed, all the</a>
<a id='line_25034'>knights and men with him. And as soon as these two ladies met together,</a>
<a id='line_25035'>she which Bors should fight for complained her, and said: Madam, ye</a>
<a id='line_25036'>have done me wrong to bereave me of my lands that King Aniause gave me,</a>
<a id='line_25037'>and full loath I am there should be any battle. Ye shall not choose,</a>
<a id='line_25038'>said the other lady, or else your knight withdraw him.</a>
<a id='line_25039'></a>
<a id='line_25040'>Then there was the cry made, which party had the better of the two</a>
<a id='line_25041'>knights, that his lady should rejoice all the land. Now departed the</a>
<a id='line_25042'>one knight here, and the other there. Then they came together with such</a>
<a id='line_25043'>a raundon that they pierced their shields and their hauberks, and the</a>
<a id='line_25044'>spears flew in pieces, and they wounded either other sore. Then hurtled</a>
<a id='line_25045'>they together, so that they fell both to the earth, and their horses</a>
<a id='line_25046'>betwixt their legs; and anon they arose, and set hands to their swords,</a>
<a id='line_25047'>and smote each one other upon the heads, that they made great wounds</a>
<a id='line_25048'>and deep, that the blood went out of their bodies. For there found Sir</a>
<a id='line_25049'>Bors greater defence in that knight more than he weened. For that</a>
<a id='line_25050'>Pridam was a passing good knight, and he wounded Sir Bors full evil,</a>
<a id='line_25051'>and he him again; but ever this Pridam held the stour in like hard.</a>
<a id='line_25052'>That perceived Sir Bors, and suffered him till he was nigh attaint. And</a>
<a id='line_25053'>then he ran upon him more and more, and the other went back for dread</a>
<a id='line_25054'>of death. So in his withdrawing he fell upright, and Sir Bors drew his</a>
<a id='line_25055'>helm so strongly that he rent it from his head, and gave him great</a>
<a id='line_25056'>strokes with the flat of his sword upon the visage, and bade him yield</a>
<a id='line_25057'>him or he should slay him. Then he cried him mercy and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_25058'>knight, for God’s love slay me not, and I shall ensure thee never to</a>
<a id='line_25059'>war against thy lady, but be alway toward her. Then Bors let him be;</a>
<a id='line_25060'>then the old lady fled with all her knights.</a>
<a id='line_25061'></a>

<a id='line_25065'>CHAPTER IX. How the lady was returned to her lands by the battle of Sir</a>
<a id='line_25066'>Bors, and of his departing, and how he met Sir Lionel taken and beaten</a>
<a id='line_25067'>with thorns, and also of a maid which should have been devoured.</a>
<a id='line_25068'></a>
<a id='line_25069'></a>
<a id='line_25070'>So then came Bors to all those that held lands of his lady, and said he</a>
<a id='line_25071'>should destroy them but if they did such service unto her as longed to</a>
<a id='line_25072'>their lands. So they did their homage, and they that would not were</a>
<a id='line_25073'>chased out of their lands. Then befell that young lady to come to her</a>
<a id='line_25074'>estate again, by the mighty prowess of Sir Bors de Ganis. So when all</a>
<a id='line_25075'>the country was well set in peace, then Sir Bors took his leave and</a>
<a id='line_25076'>departed; and she thanked him greatly, and would have given him great</a>
<a id='line_25077'>riches, but he refused it.</a>
<a id='line_25078'></a>
<a id='line_25079'>Then he rode all that day till night, and came to an harbour to a lady</a>
<a id='line_25080'>which knew him well enough, and made of him great Joy. Upon the morn,</a>
<a id='line_25081'>as soon as the day appeared, Bors departed from thence, and so rode</a>
<a id='line_25082'>into a forest unto the hour of midday, and there befell him a</a>
<a id='line_25083'>marvellous adventure. So he met at the departing of the two ways two</a>
<a id='line_25084'>knights that led Lionel, his brother, all naked, bounden upon a strong</a>
<a id='line_25085'>hackney, and his hands bounden to-fore his breast. And everych of them</a>
<a id='line_25086'>held in his hands thorns wherewith they went beating him so sore that</a>
<a id='line_25087'>the blood trailed down more than in an hundred places of his body, so</a>
<a id='line_25088'>that he was all blood to-fore and behind, but he said never a word; as</a>
<a id='line_25089'>he which was great of heart he suffered all that ever they did to him,</a>
<a id='line_25090'>as though he had felt none anguish.</a>
<a id='line_25091'></a>
<a id='line_25092'>Anon Sir Bors dressed him to rescue him that was his brother; and so he</a>
<a id='line_25093'>looked upon the other side of him, and saw a knight which brought a</a>
<a id='line_25094'>fair gentlewoman, and would have set her in the thickest place of the</a>
<a id='line_25095'>forest for to have been the more surer out of the way from them that</a>
<a id='line_25096'>sought him. And she which was nothing assured cried with an high voice:</a>
<a id='line_25097'>Saint Mary succour your maid. And anon she espied where Sir Bors came</a>
<a id='line_25098'>riding. And when she came nigh him she deemed him a knight of the Round</a>
<a id='line_25099'>Table, whereof she hoped to have some comfort; and then she conjured</a>
<a id='line_25100'>him: By the faith that he ought unto Him in whose service thou art</a>
<a id='line_25101'>entered in, and for the faith ye owe unto the high order of knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_25102'>and for the noble King Arthur’s sake, that I suppose made thee knight,</a>
<a id='line_25103'>that thou help me, and suffer me not to be shamed of this knight. When</a>
<a id='line_25104'>Bors heard her say thus he had so much sorrow there he nist not what to</a>
<a id='line_25105'>do. For if I let my brother be in adventure he must be slain, and that</a>
<a id='line_25106'>would I not for all the earth. And if I help not the maid she is shamed</a>
<a id='line_25107'>for ever, and also she shall lose her virginity the which she shall</a>
<a id='line_25108'>never get again. Then lift he up his eyes and said weeping: Fair sweet</a>
<a id='line_25109'>Lord Jesu Christ, whose liege man I am, keep Lionel, my brother, that</a>
<a id='line_25110'>these knights slay him not, and for pity of you, and for Mary’s sake, I</a>
<a id='line_25111'>shall succour this maid.</a>
<a id='line_25112'></a>

<a id='line_25114'></a>
<a id='line_25115'></a>
<a id='line_25116'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Bors left to rescue his brother, and rescued the</a>
<a id='line_25117'>damosel; and how it was told him that Lionel was dead.</a>
<a id='line_25118'></a>
<a id='line_25119'></a>
<a id='line_25120'>Then dressed he him unto the knight the which had the gentlewoman, and</a>
<a id='line_25121'>then he cried: Sir knight, let your hand off that maiden, or ye be but</a>
<a id='line_25122'>dead. And then he set down the maiden, and was armed at all pieces save</a>
<a id='line_25123'>he lacked his spear. Then he dressed his shield, and drew out his</a>
<a id='line_25124'>sword, and Bors smote him so hard that it went through his shield and</a>
<a id='line_25125'>habergeon on the left shoulder. And through great strength he beat him</a>
<a id='line_25126'>down to the earth, and at the pulling out of Bors’ spear there he</a>
<a id='line_25127'>swooned. Then came Bors to the maid and said: How seemeth it you? of</a>
<a id='line_25128'>this knight ye be delivered at this time. Now sir, said she, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_25129'>lead me thereas this knight had me. So shall I do gladly: and took the</a>
<a id='line_25130'>horse of the wounded knight, and set the gentlewoman upon him, and so</a>
<a id='line_25131'>brought her as she desired. Sir knight, said she, ye have better sped</a>
<a id='line_25132'>than ye weened, for an I had lost my maidenhead, five hundred men</a>
<a id='line_25133'>should have died for it. What knight was he that had you in the forest?</a>
<a id='line_25134'>By my faith, said she, he is my cousin. So wot I never with what engine</a>
<a id='line_25135'>the fiend enchafed him, for yesterday he took me from my father</a>
<a id='line_25136'>privily; for I, nor none of my father’s men, mistrusted him not, and if</a>
<a id='line_25137'>he had had my maidenhead he should have died for the sin, and his body</a>
<a id='line_25138'>shamed and dishonoured for ever. Thus as she stood talking with him</a>
<a id='line_25139'>there came twelve knights seeking after her, and anon she told them all</a>
<a id='line_25140'>how Bors had delivered her; then they made great joy, and besought him</a>
<a id='line_25141'>to come to her father, a great lord, and he should be right welcome.</a>
<a id='line_25142'>Truly, said Bors, that may not be at this time, for I have a great</a>
<a id='line_25143'>adventure to do in this country. So he commended them unto God and</a>
<a id='line_25144'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_25145'></a>
<a id='line_25146'>Then Sir Bors rode after Lionel, his brother, by the trace of their</a>
<a id='line_25147'>horses, thus he rode seeking a great while. Then he overtook a man</a>
<a id='line_25148'>clothed in a religious clothing; and rode on a strong black horse</a>
<a id='line_25149'>blacker than a berry, and said: Sir knight, what seek you? Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_25150'>he, I seek my brother that I saw within a while beaten with two</a>
<a id='line_25151'>knights. Ah, Bors, discomfort you not, nor fall into no wanhope; for I</a>
<a id='line_25152'>shall tell you tidings such as they be, for truly he is dead. Then</a>
<a id='line_25153'>showed he him a new slain body lying in a bush, and it seemed him well</a>
<a id='line_25154'>that it was the body of Lionel, and then he made such a sorrow that he</a>
<a id='line_25155'>fell to the earth all in a swoon, and lay a great while there. And when</a>
<a id='line_25156'>he came to himself he said: Fair brother, sith the company of you and</a>
<a id='line_25157'>me is departed shall I never have joy in my heart, and now He which I</a>
<a id='line_25158'>have taken unto my master, He be my help. And when he had said thus he</a>
<a id='line_25159'>took his body lightly in his arms, and put it upon the arson of his</a>
<a id='line_25160'>saddle. And then he said to the man: Canst thou tell me unto some</a>
<a id='line_25161'>chapel where that I may bury this body? Come on, said he, here is one</a>
<a id='line_25162'>fast by; and so long they rode till they saw a fair tower, and afore it</a>
<a id='line_25163'>there seemed an old feeble chapel. And then they alighted both, and put</a>
<a id='line_25164'>him into a tomb of marble.</a>

<a id='line_25169'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Bors told his dream to a priest, which he had</a>
<a id='line_25170'>dreamed, and of the counsel that the priest gave to him.</a>
<a id='line_25171'></a>
<a id='line_25172'></a>
<a id='line_25173'>Now leave we him here, said the good man, and go we to our harbour till</a>
<a id='line_25174'>to-morrow; we will come here again to do him service. Sir, said Bors,</a>
<a id='line_25175'>be ye a priest? Yea forsooth, said he. Then I pray you tell me a dream</a>
<a id='line_25176'>that befell to me the last night. Say on, said he. Then he began so</a>
<a id='line_25177'>much to tell him of the great bird in the forest, and after told him of</a>
<a id='line_25178'>his birds, one white, another black, and of the rotten tree, and of the</a>
<a id='line_25179'>white flowers. Sir, I shall tell you a part now, and the other deal</a>
<a id='line_25180'>to-morrow. The white fowl betokeneth a gentlewoman, fair and rich,</a>
<a id='line_25181'>which loved thee paramours, and hath loved thee long; and if thou warn</a>
<a id='line_25182'>her love she shall go die anon, if thou have no pity on her. That</a>
<a id='line_25183'>signifieth the great bird, the which shall make thee to warn her. Now</a>
<a id='line_25184'>for no fear that thou hast, ne for no dread that thou hast of God, thou</a>
<a id='line_25185'>shalt not warn her, but thou wouldst not do it for to be holden chaste,</a>
<a id='line_25186'>for to conquer the loos of the vain glory of the world; for that shall</a>
<a id='line_25187'>befall thee now an thou warn her, that Launcelot, the good knight, thy</a>
<a id='line_25188'>cousin, shall die. And therefore men shall now say that thou art a</a>
<a id='line_25189'>manslayer, both of thy brother, Sir Lionel, and of thy cousin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_25190'>Launcelot du Lake, the which thou mightest have saved and rescued</a>
<a id='line_25191'>easily, but thou weenedst to rescue a maid which pertaineth nothing to</a>
<a id='line_25192'>thee. Now look thou whether it had been greater harm of thy brother’s</a>
<a id='line_25193'>death, or else to have suffered her to have lost her maidenhood. Then</a>
<a id='line_25194'>asked he him: Hast thou heard the tokens of thy dream the which I have</a>
<a id='line_25195'>told to you? Yea forsooth, said Sir Bors, all your exposition and</a>
<a id='line_25196'>declaring of my dream I have well understood and heard. Then said the</a>
<a id='line_25197'>man in this black clothing: Then is it in thy default if Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_25198'>thy cousin, die. Sir, said Bors, that were me loath, for wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_25199'>there is nothing in the world but I had liefer do it than to see my</a>
<a id='line_25200'>lord, Sir Launcelot du Lake, to die in my default. Choose ye now the</a>
<a id='line_25201'>one or the other, said the good man.</a>
<a id='line_25202'></a>
<a id='line_25203'>And then he led Sir Bors into an high tower, and there he found knights</a>
<a id='line_25204'>and ladies: those ladies said he was welcome, and so they unarmed him.</a>
<a id='line_25205'>And when he was in his doublet men brought him a mantle furred with</a>
<a id='line_25206'>ermine, and put it about him; and then they made him such cheer that he</a>
<a id='line_25207'>had forgotten all his sorrow and anguish, and only set his heart in</a>
<a id='line_25208'>these delights and dainties, and took no thought more for his brother,</a>
<a id='line_25209'>Sir Lionel, neither of Sir Launcelot du Lake, his cousin. And anon came</a>
<a id='line_25210'>out of a chamber to him the fairest lady than ever he saw, and more</a>
<a id='line_25211'>richer beseen than ever he saw Queen Guenever or any other estate. Lo,</a>
<a id='line_25212'>said they, Sir Bors, here is the lady unto whom we owe all our service,</a>
<a id='line_25213'>and I trow she be the richest lady and the fairest of all the world,</a>
<a id='line_25214'>and the which loveth you best above all other knights, for she will</a>
<a id='line_25215'>have no knight but you. And when he understood that language he was</a>
<a id='line_25216'>abashed. Not for then she saluted him, and he her; and then they sat</a>
<a id='line_25217'>down together and spake of many things, in so much that she besought</a>
<a id='line_25218'>him to be her love, for she had loved him above all earthly men, and</a>
<a id='line_25219'>she should make him richer than ever was man of his age. When Bors</a>
<a id='line_25220'>understood her words he was right evil at ease, which in no manner</a>
<a id='line_25221'>would not break chastity, so wist not he how to answer her.</a>
<a id='line_25222'></a>

<a id='line_25225'></a>
<a id='line_25226'>CHAPTER XII. How the devil in a woman’s likeness would have had Sir</a>
<a id='line_25227'>Bors to have lain by her, and how by God’s grace he escaped.</a>
<a id='line_25228'></a>
<a id='line_25229'></a>
<a id='line_25230'>Alas, said she, Bors, shall ye not do my will? Madam, said Bors, there</a>
<a id='line_25231'>is no lady in the world whose will I will fulfil as of this thing, for</a>
<a id='line_25232'>my brother lieth dead which was slain right late. Ah Bors, said she, I</a>
<a id='line_25233'>have loved you long for the great beauty I have seen in you, and the</a>
<a id='line_25234'>great hardiness that I have heard of you, that needs ye must lie by me</a>
<a id='line_25235'>this night, and therefore I pray you grant it me. Truly, said he, I</a>
<a id='line_25236'>shall not do it in no manner wise. Then she made him such sorrow as</a>
<a id='line_25237'>though she would have died. Well Bors, said she, unto this have ye</a>
<a id='line_25238'>brought me, nigh to mine end. And therewith she took him by the hand,</a>
<a id='line_25239'>and bade him behold her. And ye shall see how I shall die for your</a>
<a id='line_25240'>love. Ah, said then he, that shall I never see.</a>
<a id='line_25241'></a>
<a id='line_25242'>Then she departed and went up into an high battlement, and led with her</a>
<a id='line_25243'>twelve gentlewomen; and when they were above, one of the gentlewomen</a>
<a id='line_25244'>cried, and said: Ah, Sir Bors, gentle knight have mercy on us all, and</a>
<a id='line_25245'>suffer my lady to have her will, and if ye do not we must suffer death</a>
<a id='line_25246'>with our lady, for to fall down off this high tower, and if ye suffer</a>
<a id='line_25247'>us thus to die for so little a thing all ladies and gentlewomen will</a>
<a id='line_25248'>say or you dishonour. Then looked he upward, they seemed all ladies of</a>
<a id='line_25249'>great estate, and richly and well beseen. Then had he of them great</a>
<a id='line_25250'>pity; not for that he was uncounselled in himself that liefer he had</a>
<a id='line_25251'>they all had lost their souls than he his, and with that they fell</a>
<a id='line_25252'>adown all at once unto the earth. And when he saw that, he was all</a>
<a id='line_25253'>abashed, and had thereof great marvel. With that he blessed his body</a>
<a id='line_25254'>and his visage. And anon he heard a great noise and a great cry, as</a>
<a id='line_25255'>though all the fiends of hell had been about him; and therewith he saw</a>
<a id='line_25256'>neither tower, nor lady, nor gentlewoman, nor no chapel where he</a>
<a id='line_25257'>brought his brother to. Then held he up both his hands to the heaven,</a>
<a id='line_25258'>and said: Fair Father God, I am grievously escaped; and then he took</a>
<a id='line_25259'>his arms and his horse and rode on his way.</a>
<a id='line_25260'></a>
<a id='line_25261'>Then he heard a clock smite on his right hand; and thither he came to</a>
<a id='line_25262'>an abbey on his right hand, closed with high walls, and there was let</a>
<a id='line_25263'>in. Then they supposed that he was one of the quest of the Sangreal, so</a>
<a id='line_25264'>they led him into a chamber and unarmed him. Sirs, said Sir Bors, if</a>
<a id='line_25265'>there be any holy man in this house I pray you let me speak with him.</a>
<a id='line_25266'>Then one of them led him unto the Abbot, which was in a chapel. And</a>
<a id='line_25267'>then Sir Bors saluted him, and he him again. Sir, said Bors, I am a</a>
<a id='line_25268'>knight-errant; and told him all the adventure which he had seen. Sir</a>
<a id='line_25269'>Knight, said the Abbot, I wot not what ye be, for I weened never that a</a>
<a id='line_25270'>knight of your age might have been so strong in the grace of our Lord</a>
<a id='line_25271'>Jesu Christ. Not for then ye shall go unto your rest, for I will not</a>
<a id='line_25272'>counsel you this day, it is too late, and to-morrow I shall counsel you</a>
<a id='line_25273'>as I can.</a>
<a id='line_25274'></a>

<a id='line_25276'></a>
<a id='line_25277'></a>
<a id='line_25278'>CHAPTER XIII. Of the holy communication of an Abbot to Sir Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_25279'>how the Abbot counselled him.</a>
<a id='line_25280'></a>
<a id='line_25281'></a>
<a id='line_25282'>And that night was Sir Bors served richly; and on the morn early he</a>
<a id='line_25283'>heard mass, and the Abbot came to him, and bade him good morrow, and</a>
<a id='line_25284'>Bors to him again. And then he told him he was a fellow of the quest of</a>
<a id='line_25285'>the Sangreal, and how he had charge of the holy man to eat bread and</a>
<a id='line_25286'>water. Then [said the Abbot]: Our Lord Jesu Christ showed him unto you</a>
<a id='line_25287'>in the likeness of a soul that suffered great anguish for us, since He</a>
<a id='line_25288'>was put upon the cross, and bled His heart-blood for mankind: there was</a>
<a id='line_25289'>the token and the likeness of the Sangreal that appeared afore you, for</a>
<a id='line_25290'>the blood that the great fowl bled revived the chickens from death to</a>
<a id='line_25291'>life. And by the bare tree is betokened the world which is naked and</a>
<a id='line_25292'>without fruit but if it come of Our Lord. Also the lady for whom ye</a>
<a id='line_25293'>fought for, and King Aniause which was lord there-to-fore, betokeneth</a>
<a id='line_25294'>Jesu Christ which is the King of the world. And that ye fought with the</a>
<a id='line_25295'>champion for the lady, this it betokeneth: for when ye took the battle</a>
<a id='line_25296'>for the lady, by her shall ye understand the new law of Jesu Christ and</a>
<a id='line_25297'>Holy Church; and by the other lady ye shall understand the old law and</a>
<a id='line_25298'>the fiend, which all day warreth against Holy Church, therefore ye did</a>
<a id='line_25299'>your battle with right. For ye be Jesu Christ’s knights, therefore ye</a>
<a id='line_25300'>ought to be defenders of Holy Church. And by the black bird might ye</a>
<a id='line_25301'>understand Holy Church, which sayeth I am black, but he is fair. And by</a>
<a id='line_25302'>the white bird might men understand the fiend, and I shall tell you how</a>
<a id='line_25303'>the swan is white without-forth, and black within: it is hypocrisy</a>
<a id='line_25304'>which is without yellow or pale, and seemeth without-forth the servants</a>
<a id='line_25305'>of Jesu Christ, but they be within so horrible of filth and sin, and</a>
<a id='line_25306'>beguile the world evil. Also when the fiend appeared to thee in</a>
<a id='line_25307'>likeness of a man of religion, and blamed thee that thou left thy</a>
<a id='line_25308'>brother for a lady, so led thee where thou seemed thy brother was</a>
<a id='line_25309'>slain, but he is yet alive; and all was for to put thee in error, and</a>
<a id='line_25310'>bring thee unto wanhope and lechery, for he knew thou were tender</a>
<a id='line_25311'>hearted, and all was for thou shouldst not find the blessed adventure</a>
<a id='line_25312'>of the Sangreal. And the third fowl betokeneth the strong battle</a>
<a id='line_25313'>against the fair ladies which were all devils. Also the dry tree and</a>
<a id='line_25314'>the white lily: the dry tree betokeneth thy brother Lionel, which is</a>
<a id='line_25315'>dry without virtue, and therefore many men ought to call him the rotten</a>
<a id='line_25316'>tree, and the worm-eaten tree, for he is a murderer and doth contrary</a>
<a id='line_25317'>to the order of knighthood. And the two white flowers signify two</a>
<a id='line_25318'>maidens, the one is a knight which was wounded the other day, and the</a>
<a id='line_25319'>other is the gentlewoman which ye rescued; and why the other flower</a>
<a id='line_25320'>drew nigh the other, that was the knight which would have defouled her</a>
<a id='line_25321'>and himself both. And Sir Bors, ye had been a great fool and in great</a>
<a id='line_25322'>peril for to have seen those two flowers perish for to succour the</a>
<a id='line_25323'>rotten tree, for an they had sinned together they had been damned; and</a>
<a id='line_25324'>for that ye rescued them both, men might call you a very knight and</a>
<a id='line_25325'>servant of Jesu Christ.</a>

<a id='line_25330'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Bors met with his brother Sir Lionel, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_25331'>Lionel would have slain Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_25332'></a>
<a id='line_25333'></a>
<a id='line_25334'>Then went Sir Bors from thence and commended the Abbot unto God. And</a>
<a id='line_25335'>then he rode all that day, and harboured with an old lady. And on the</a>
<a id='line_25336'>morn he rode to a castle in a valley, and there he met with a yeoman</a>
<a id='line_25337'>going a great pace toward a forest. Say me, said Sir Bors, canst thou</a>
<a id='line_25338'>tell me of any adventure? Sir, said he, here shall be under this castle</a>
<a id='line_25339'>a great and a marvellous tournament. Of what folks shall it be? said</a>
<a id='line_25340'>Sir Bors. The Earl of Plains shall be in the one party, and the lady’s</a>
<a id='line_25341'>nephew of Hervin on the other party. Then Bors thought to be there if</a>
<a id='line_25342'>he might meet with his brother Sir Lionel, or any other of his</a>
<a id='line_25343'>fellowship, which were in the quest of the Sangreal. And then he turned</a>
<a id='line_25344'>to an hermitage that was in the entry of the forest.</a>
<a id='line_25345'></a>
<a id='line_25346'>And when he was come thither he found there Sir Lionel, his brother,</a>
<a id='line_25347'>which sat all armed at the entry of the chapel door for to abide there</a>
<a id='line_25348'>harbour till on the morn that the tournament shall be. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_25349'>Bors saw him he had great joy of him, that it were marvel to tell of</a>
<a id='line_25350'>his joy. And then he alighted off his horse, and said: Fair sweet</a>
<a id='line_25351'>brother, when came ye hither? Anon as Lionel saw him he said: Ah Bors,</a>
<a id='line_25352'>ye may not make none avaunt, but as for you I might have been slain;</a>
<a id='line_25353'>when ye saw two knights leading me away beating me, ye left me for to</a>
<a id='line_25354'>succour a gentlewoman, and suffered me in peril of death; for never</a>
<a id='line_25355'>erst ne did no brother to another so great an untruth. And for that</a>
<a id='line_25356'>misdeed now I ensure you but death, for well have ye deserved it;</a>
<a id='line_25357'>therefore keep thee from henceforward, and that shall ye find as soon</a>
<a id='line_25358'>as I am armed. When Sir Bors understood his brother’s wrath he kneeled</a>
<a id='line_25359'>down to the earth and cried him mercy, holding up both his hands, and</a>
<a id='line_25360'>prayed him to forgive him his evil will. Nay, said Lionel, that shall</a>
<a id='line_25361'>never be an I may have the higher hand, that I make mine avow to God,</a>
<a id='line_25362'>thou shalt have death for it, for it were pity ye lived any longer.</a>
<a id='line_25363'></a>
<a id='line_25364'>Right so he went in and took his harness, and mounted upon his horse,</a>
<a id='line_25365'>and came to-fore him and said: Bors, keep thee from me, for I shall do</a>
<a id='line_25366'>to thee as I would to a felon or a traitor, for ye be the untruest</a>
<a id='line_25367'>knight that ever came out of so worthy an house as was King Bors de</a>
<a id='line_25368'>Ganis which was our father, therefore start upon thy horse, and so</a>
<a id='line_25369'>shall ye be most at your advantage. And but if ye will I will run upon</a>
<a id='line_25370'>you thereas ye stand upon foot, and so the shame shall be mine and the</a>
<a id='line_25371'>harm yours, but of that shame ne reck I nought.</a>
<a id='line_25372'></a>
<a id='line_25373'>When Sir Bors saw that he must fight with his brother or else to die,</a>
<a id='line_25374'>he nist what to do; then his heart counselled him not thereto, inasmuch</a>
<a id='line_25375'>as Lionel was born or he, wherefore he ought to bear him reverence; yet</a>
<a id='line_25376'>kneeled he down afore Lionel’s horse’s feet, and said: Fair sweet</a>
<a id='line_25377'>brother, have mercy upon me and slay me not, and have in remembrance</a>
<a id='line_25378'>the great love which ought to be between us twain. What Sir Bors said</a>
<a id='line_25379'>to Lionel he rought not, for the fiend had brought him in such a will</a>
<a id='line_25380'>that he should slay him. Then when Lionel saw he would none other, and</a>
<a id='line_25381'>that he would not have risen to give him battle, he rashed over him so</a>
<a id='line_25382'>that he smote Bors with his horse, feet upward, to the earth, and hurt</a>
<a id='line_25383'>him so sore that he swooned of distress, the which he felt in himself</a>
<a id='line_25384'>to have died without confession. So when Lionel saw this, he alighted</a>
<a id='line_25385'>off his horse to have smitten off his head. And so he took him by the</a>
<a id='line_25386'>helm, and would have rent it from his head. Then came the hermit</a>
<a id='line_25387'>running unto him, which was a good man and of great age, and well had</a>
<a id='line_25388'>heard all the words that were between them, and so fell down upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_25389'>Bors.</a>
<a id='line_25390'></a>

<a id='line_25396'></a>
<a id='line_25397'></a>
<a id='line_25398'>Then he said to Lionel: Ah gentle knight, have mercy upon me and on thy</a>
<a id='line_25399'>brother, for if thou slay him thou shalt be dead of sin, and that were</a>
<a id='line_25400'>sorrowful, for he is one of the worthiest knights of the world, and of</a>
<a id='line_25401'>the best conditions. So God help me, said Lionel, sir priest, but if ye</a>
<a id='line_25402'>flee from him I shall slay you, and he shall never the sooner be quit.</a>
<a id='line_25403'>Certes, said the good man, I have liefer ye slay me than him, for my</a>
<a id='line_25404'>death shall not be great harm, not half so much as of his. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_25405'>Lionel, I am greed; and set his hand to his sword and smote him so hard</a>
<a id='line_25406'>that his head yede backward. Not for that he restrained him of his evil</a>
<a id='line_25407'>will, but took his brother by the helm, and unlaced it to have stricken</a>
<a id='line_25408'>off his head, and had slain him without fail. But so it happed,</a>
<a id='line_25409'>Colgrevance a fellow of the Round Table, came at that time thither as</a>
<a id='line_25410'>Our Lord’s will was. And when he saw the good man slain he marvelled</a>
<a id='line_25411'>much what it might be. And then he beheld Lionel would have slain his</a>
<a id='line_25412'>brother, and knew Sir Bors which he loved right well. Then stert he</a>
<a id='line_25413'>down and took Lionel by the shoulders, and drew him strongly aback from</a>
<a id='line_25414'>Bors, and said: Lionel, will ye slay your brother, the worthiest knight</a>
<a id='line_25415'>of the world one? and that should no good man suffer. Why, said Lionel,</a>
<a id='line_25416'>will ye let me? therefore if ye entermete you in this I shall slay you,</a>
<a id='line_25417'>and him after. Why, said Colgrevance, is this sooth that ye will slay</a>
<a id='line_25418'>him? Slay him will I, said he, whoso say the contrary, for he hath done</a>
<a id='line_25419'>so much against me that he hath well deserved it. And so ran upon him,</a>
<a id='line_25420'>and would have smitten him through the head, and Sir Colgrevance ran</a>
<a id='line_25421'>betwixt them, and said: An ye be so hardy to do so more, we two shall</a>
<a id='line_25422'>meddle together.</a>
<a id='line_25423'></a>
<a id='line_25424'>When Lionel understood his words he took his shield afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_25425'>asked him what that he was. And he told him, Colgrevance, one of his</a>
<a id='line_25426'>fellows. Then Lionel defied him, and gave him a great stroke through</a>
<a id='line_25427'>the helm. Then he drew his sword, for he was a passing good knight, and</a>
<a id='line_25428'>defended him right manfully. So long dured the battle that Bors rose up</a>
<a id='line_25429'>all anguishly, and beheld [how] Colgrevance, the good knight, fought</a>
<a id='line_25430'>with his brother for his quarrel; then was he full sorry and heavy, and</a>
<a id='line_25431'>thought if Colgrevance slew him that was his brother he should never</a>
<a id='line_25432'>have joy; and if his brother slew Colgrevance the shame should ever be</a>
<a id='line_25433'>mine. Then would he have risen to have departed them, but he had not so</a>
<a id='line_25434'>much might to stand on foot; so he abode him so long till Colgrevance</a>
<a id='line_25435'>had the worse, for Lionel was of great chivalry and right hardy, for he</a>
<a id='line_25436'>had pierced the hauberk and the helm, that he abode but death, for he</a>
<a id='line_25437'>had lost much of his blood that it was marvel that he might stand</a>
<a id='line_25438'>upright. Then beheld he Sir Bors which sat dressing him upward and</a>
<a id='line_25439'>said: Ah, Bors, why come ye not to cast me out of peril of death,</a>
<a id='line_25440'>wherein I have put me to succour you which were right now nigh the</a>
<a id='line_25441'>death? Certes, said Lionel, that shall not avail you, for none of you</a>
<a id='line_25442'>shall bear others warrant, but that ye shall die both of my hand. When</a>
<a id='line_25443'>Bors heard that, he did so much, he rose and put on his helm. Then</a>
<a id='line_25444'>perceived he first the hermit-priest which was slain, then made he a</a>
<a id='line_25445'>marvellous sorrow upon him.</a>
<a id='line_25446'></a>

<a id='line_25450'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Lionel slew Sir Colgrevance, and how after he</a>
<a id='line_25451'>would have slain Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_25452'></a>
<a id='line_25453'></a>
<a id='line_25454'>Then oft Colgrevance cried upon Sir Bors: Why will ye let me die here</a>
<a id='line_25455'>for your sake? if it please you that I die for you the death, it will</a>
<a id='line_25456'>please me the better for to save a worthy man. With that word Sir</a>
<a id='line_25457'>Lionel smote off the helm from his head. Then Colgrevance saw that he</a>
<a id='line_25458'>might not escape; then he said: Fair sweet Jesu, that I have misdone</a>
<a id='line_25459'>have mercy upon my soul, for such sorrow that my heart suffereth for</a>
<a id='line_25460'>goodness, and for alms deed that I would have done here, be to me</a>
<a id='line_25461'>aligement of penance unto my soul’s health. At these words Lionel smote</a>
<a id='line_25462'>him so sore that he bare him to the earth. So he had slain Colgrevance</a>
<a id='line_25463'>he ran upon his brother as a fiendly man, and gave him such a stroke</a>
<a id='line_25464'>that he made him stoop. And he that was full of humility prayed him for</a>
<a id='line_25465'>God’s love to leave this battle: For an it befell, fair brother, that I</a>
<a id='line_25466'>slew you or ye me, we should be dead of that sin. Never God me help but</a>
<a id='line_25467'>if I have on you mercy, an I may have the better hand. Then drew Bors</a>
<a id='line_25468'>his sword, all weeping, and said: Fair brother, God knoweth mine</a>
<a id='line_25469'>intent. Ah, fair brother, ye have done full evil this day to slay such</a>
<a id='line_25470'>an holy priest the which never trespassed. Also ye have slain a gentle</a>
<a id='line_25471'>knight, and one of our fellows. And well wot ye that I am not afeard of</a>
<a id='line_25472'>you greatly, but I dread the wrath of God, and this is an unkindly war,</a>
<a id='line_25473'>therefore God show miracle upon us both. Now God have mercy upon me</a>
<a id='line_25474'>though I defend my life against my brother: with that Bors lift up his</a>
<a id='line_25475'>hand and would have smitten his brother.</a>
<a id='line_25476'></a>
<a id='line_25477'></a>
<a id='line_25478'></a>
<a id='line_25479'></a>
<a id='line_25480'>CHAPTER XVII. How there came a voice which charged Sir Bors to touch</a>
<a id='line_25481'>him not, and of a cloud that came between them.</a>
<a id='line_25482'></a>
<a id='line_25483'></a>
<a id='line_25484'>And then he heard a voice that said: Flee Bors, and touch him not, or</a>
<a id='line_25485'>else thou shalt slay him. Right so alighted a cloud betwixt them in</a>
<a id='line_25486'>likeness of a fire and a marvellous flame, that both their two shields</a>
<a id='line_25487'>brent. Then were they sore afraid, that they fell both to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_25488'>and lay there a great while in a swoon. And when they came to themself,</a>
<a id='line_25489'>Bors saw that his brother had no harm; then he held up both his hands,</a>
<a id='line_25490'>for he dread God had taken vengeance upon him. With that he heard a</a>
<a id='line_25491'>voice say: Bors, go hence, and bear thy brother no longer fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_25492'>but take thy way anon right to the sea, for Sir Percivale abideth thee</a>
<a id='line_25493'>there. Then he said to his brother: Fair sweet brother, forgive me for</a>
<a id='line_25494'>God’s love all that I have trespassed unto you. Then he answered: God</a>
<a id='line_25495'>forgive it thee and I do gladly.</a>
<a id='line_25496'></a>
<a id='line_25497'>So Sir Bors departed from him and rode the next way to the sea. And at</a>
<a id='line_25498'>the last by fortune he came to an abbey which was nigh the sea. That</a>
<a id='line_25499'>night Bors rested him there; and in his sleep there came a voice to him</a>
<a id='line_25500'>and bade him go to the sea. Then he stert up and made a sign of the</a>
<a id='line_25501'>cross in the midst of his forehead, and took his harness, and made</a>
<a id='line_25502'>ready his horse, and mounted upon him; and at a broken wall he rode</a>
<a id='line_25503'>out, and rode so long till that he came to the sea. And on the strand</a>
<a id='line_25504'>he found a ship covered all with white samite, and he alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_25505'>betook him to Jesu Christ. And as soon as he entered into the ship, the</a>
<a id='line_25506'>ship departed into the sea, and went so fast that him seemed the ship</a>
<a id='line_25507'>went flying, but it was soon dark so that he might know no man, and so</a>
<a id='line_25508'>he slept till it was day. Then he awaked, and saw in midst of the ship</a>
<a id='line_25509'>a knight lie all armed save his helm. Then knew he that it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_25510'>Percivale of Wales, and then he made of him right great joy; but Sir</a>
<a id='line_25511'>Percivale was abashed of him, and he asked him what he was. Ah, fair</a>
<a id='line_25512'>sir, said Bors, know ye me not? Certes, said he, I marvel how ye came</a>
<a id='line_25513'>hither, but if Our Lord brought ye hither Himself. Then Sir Bors smiled</a>
<a id='line_25514'>and did off his helm. Then Percivale knew him, and either made great</a>
<a id='line_25515'>joy of other, that it was marvel to hear. Then Bors told him how he</a>
<a id='line_25516'>came into the ship, and by whose admonishment; and either told other of</a>
<a id='line_25517'>their temptations, as ye have heard to-forehand. So went they downward</a>
<a id='line_25518'>in the sea, one while backward, another while forward, and everych</a>
<a id='line_25519'>comforted other, and oft were in their prayers. Then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_25520'>Percivale: We lack nothing but Galahad, the good knight.</a>
<a id='line_25521'></a>
<a id='line_25522'>_And thus endeth the sixteenth book, which is of Sir Gawaine, Ector de</a>

<a id='line_25533'></a>
<a id='line_25534'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Galahad fought at a tournament, and how he was known</a>
<a id='line_25535'>of Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris.</a>
<a id='line_25536'></a>
<a id='line_25537'></a>
<a id='line_25538'>Now saith this story, when Galahad had rescued Percivale from the</a>
<a id='line_25539'>twenty knights, he yede tho into a waste forest wherein he rode many</a>
<a id='line_25540'>journeys; and he found many adventures the which he brought to an end,</a>
<a id='line_25541'>whereof the story maketh here no mention. Then he took his way to the</a>
<a id='line_25542'>sea on a day, and it befell as he passed by a castle where was a wonder</a>
<a id='line_25543'>tournament, but they without had done so much that they within were put</a>
<a id='line_25544'>to the worse, yet were they within good knights enough. When Galahad</a>
<a id='line_25545'>saw that those within were at so great a mischief that men slew them at</a>
<a id='line_25546'>the entry of the castle, then he thought to help them, and put a spear</a>
<a id='line_25547'>forth and smote the first that he fell to the earth, and the spear</a>
<a id='line_25548'>brake to pieces. Then he drew his sword and smote thereas they were</a>
<a id='line_25549'>thickest, and so he did wonderful deeds of arms that all they</a>
<a id='line_25550'>marvelled. Then it happed that Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris were with</a>
<a id='line_25551'>the knights without. But when they espied the white shield with the red</a>
<a id='line_25552'>cross the one said to the other: Yonder is the good knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_25553'>Galahad, the haut prince: now he should be a great fool which should</a>
<a id='line_25554'>meet with him to fight. So by adventure he came by Sir Gawaine, and he</a>
<a id='line_25555'>smote him so hard that he clave his helm and the coif of iron unto his</a>
<a id='line_25556'>head, so that Gawaine fell to the earth; but the stroke was so great</a>
<a id='line_25557'>that it slanted down to the earth and carved the horse’s shoulder in</a>
<a id='line_25558'>two.</a>
<a id='line_25559'></a>
<a id='line_25560'>When Ector saw Gawaine down he drew him aside, and thought it no wisdom</a>
<a id='line_25561'>for to abide him, and also for natural love, that he was his uncle.</a>
<a id='line_25562'>Thus through his great hardiness he beat aback all the knights without.</a>
<a id='line_25563'>And then they within came out and chased them all about. But when</a>
<a id='line_25564'>Galahad saw there would none turn again he stole away privily, so that</a>
<a id='line_25565'>none wist where he was become. Now by my head, said Gawaine to Ector,</a>
<a id='line_25566'>now are the wonders true that were said of Launcelot du Lake, that the</a>
<a id='line_25567'>sword which stuck in the stone should give me such a buffet that I</a>
<a id='line_25568'>would not have it for the best castle in this world; and soothly now it</a>
<a id='line_25569'>is proved true, for never ere had I such a stroke of man’s hand. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_25570'>said Ector, meseemeth your quest is done. And yours is not done, said</a>
<a id='line_25571'>Gawaine, but mine is done, I shall seek no further. Then Gawaine was</a>
<a id='line_25572'>borne into a castle and unarmed him, and laid him in a rich bed, and a</a>
<a id='line_25573'>leech found that he might live, and to be whole within a month. Thus</a>
<a id='line_25574'>Gawaine and Ector abode together, for Sir Ector would not away till</a>
<a id='line_25575'>Gawaine were whole.</a>
<a id='line_25576'></a>
<a id='line_25577'>And the good knight, Galahad, rode so long till he came that night to</a>
<a id='line_25578'>the Castle of Carboneck; and it befell him thus that he was benighted</a>
<a id='line_25579'>in an hermitage. So the good man was fain when he saw he was a</a>
<a id='line_25580'>knight-errant. Tho when they were at rest there came a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_25581'>knocking at the door, and called Galahad, and so the good man came to</a>
<a id='line_25582'>the door to wit what she would. Then she called the hermit: Sir Ulfin,</a>
<a id='line_25583'>I am a gentlewoman that would speak with the knight which is with you.</a>
<a id='line_25584'>Then the good man awaked Galahad, and bade him: Arise, and speak with a</a>
<a id='line_25585'>gentlewoman that seemeth hath great need of you. Then Galahad went to</a>
<a id='line_25586'>her and asked her what she would. Galahad, said she, I will that ye arm</a>
<a id='line_25587'>you, and mount upon your horse and follow me, for I shall show you</a>
<a id='line_25588'>within these three days the highest adventure that ever any knight saw.</a>
<a id='line_25589'>Anon Galahad armed him, and took his horse, and commended him to God,</a>
<a id='line_25590'>and bade the gentlewoman go, and he would follow thereas she liked.</a>
<a id='line_25591'></a>
<a id='line_25592'></a>
<a id='line_25593'></a>
<a id='line_25594'></a>
<a id='line_25595'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Galahad rode with a damosel, and came to the ship</a>
<a id='line_25596'>whereas Sir Bors and Sir Percivale were in.</a>
<a id='line_25597'></a>
<a id='line_25598'></a>
<a id='line_25599'>So she rode as fast as her palfrey might bear her, till that she came</a>
<a id='line_25600'>to the sea, the which was called Collibe. And at the night they came</a>
<a id='line_25601'>unto a castle in a valley, closed with a running water, and with strong</a>
<a id='line_25602'>walls and high; and so she entered into the castle with Galahad, and</a>
<a id='line_25603'>there had he great cheer, for the lady of that castle was the damosel’s</a>
<a id='line_25604'>lady. So when he was unarmed, then said the damosel: Madam, shall we</a>
<a id='line_25605'>abide here all this day? Nay, said she, but till he hath dined and till</a>
<a id='line_25606'>he hath slept a little. So he ate and slept a while till that the maid</a>
<a id='line_25607'>called him, and armed him by torchlight. And when the maid was horsed</a>
<a id='line_25608'>and he both, the lady took Galahad a fair child and rich; and so they</a>
<a id='line_25609'>departed from the castle till they came to the seaside; and there they</a>
<a id='line_25610'>found the ship where Bors and Percivale were in, the which cried on the</a>
<a id='line_25611'>ship’s board: Sir Galahad, ye be welcome, we have abiden you long. And</a>
<a id='line_25612'>when he heard them he asked them what they were. Sir, said she, leave</a>
<a id='line_25613'>your horse here, and I shall leave mine; and took their saddles and</a>
<a id='line_25614'>their bridles with them, and made a cross on them, and so entered into</a>
<a id='line_25615'>the ship. And the two knights received them both with great joy, and</a>
<a id='line_25616'>everych knew other; and so the wind arose, and drove them through the</a>
<a id='line_25617'>sea in a marvellous pace. And within a while it dawned.</a>
<a id='line_25618'></a>
<a id='line_25619'>Then did Galahad off his helm and his sword, and asked of his fellows</a>
<a id='line_25620'>from whence came that fair ship. Truly, said they, ye wot as well as</a>
<a id='line_25621'>we, but of God’s grace; and then they told everych to other of all</a>
<a id='line_25622'>their hard adventures, and of their great temptations. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_25623'>Galahad, ye are much bounden to God, for ye have escaped great</a>
<a id='line_25624'>adventures; and had not the gentlewoman been I had not come here, for</a>
<a id='line_25625'>as for you I weened never to have found you in these strange countries.</a>
<a id='line_25626'>Ah Galahad, said Bors, if Launcelot, your father, were here then were</a>
<a id='line_25627'>we well at ease, for then meseemed we failed nothing. That may not be,</a>
<a id='line_25628'>said Galahad, but if it pleased Our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_25629'></a>
<a id='line_25630'>By then the ship went from the land of Logris, and by adventure it</a>
<a id='line_25631'>arrived up betwixt two rocks passing great and marvellous; but there</a>
<a id='line_25632'>they might not land, for there was a swallow of the sea, save there was</a>
<a id='line_25633'>another ship, and upon it they might go without danger. Go we thither,</a>
<a id='line_25634'>said the gentlewoman, and there shall we see adventures, for so is Our</a>
<a id='line_25635'>Lord’s will. And when they came thither they found the ship rich</a>
<a id='line_25636'>enough, but they found neither man nor woman therein. But they found in</a>
<a id='line_25637'>the end of the ship two fair letters written, which said a dreadful</a>
<a id='line_25638'>word and a marvellous: Thou man, which shall enter into this ship,</a>
<a id='line_25639'>beware thou be in steadfast belief, for I am Faith, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_25640'>beware how thou enterest, for an thou fail I shall not help thee. Then</a>
<a id='line_25641'>said the gentlewoman: Percivale, wot ye what I am? Certes, said he,</a>
<a id='line_25642'>nay, to my witting. Wit ye well, said she, that I am thy sister, which</a>
<a id='line_25643'>am daughter of King Pellinore, and therefore wit ye well ye are the man</a>
<a id='line_25644'>in the world that I most love; and if ye be not in perfect belief of</a>
<a id='line_25645'>Jesu Christ enter not in no manner of wise, for then should ye perish</a>
<a id='line_25646'>the ship, for he is so perfect he will suffer no sinner in him. When</a>
<a id='line_25647'>Percivale understood that she was his very sister he was inwardly glad,</a>
<a id='line_25648'>and said: Fair sister, I shall enter therein, for if I be a miscreature</a>
<a id='line_25649'>or an untrue knight there shall I perish.</a>
<a id='line_25650'></a>
<a id='line_25651'></a>
<a id='line_25652'></a>
<a id='line_25653'></a>
<a id='line_25654'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Galahad entered into the ship, and of a fair bed</a>
<a id='line_25655'>therein, with other marvellous things, and of a sword.</a>
<a id='line_25656'></a>
<a id='line_25657'></a>
<a id='line_25658'>In the meanwhile Galahad blessed him, and entered therein; and then</a>
<a id='line_25659'>next the gentlewoman, and then Sir Bors and Sir Percivale. And when</a>
<a id='line_25660'>they were in, it was so marvellous fair and rich that they marvelled;</a>
<a id='line_25661'>and in midst of the ship was a fair bed, and Galahad went thereto, and</a>
<a id='line_25662'>found there a crown of silk. And at the feet was a sword, rich and</a>
<a id='line_25663'>fair, and it was drawn out of the sheath half a foot and more; and the</a>
<a id='line_25664'>sword was of divers fashions, and the pommel was of stone, and there</a>
<a id='line_25665'>was in him all manner of colours that any man might find, and everych</a>
<a id='line_25666'>of the colours had divers virtues; and the scales of the haft were of</a>
<a id='line_25667'>two ribs of divers beasts, the one beast was a serpent which was</a>
<a id='line_25668'>conversant in Calidone, and is called the Serpent of the fiend; and the</a>
<a id='line_25669'>bone of him is of such a virtue that there is no hand that handleth him</a>
<a id='line_25670'>shall never be weary nor hurt. And the other beast is a fish which is</a>
<a id='line_25671'>not right great, and haunteth the flood of Euphrates; and that fish is</a>
<a id='line_25672'>called Ertanax, and his bones be of such a manner of kind that who that</a>
<a id='line_25673'>handleth them shall have so much will that he shall never be weary, and</a>
<a id='line_25674'>he shall not think on joy nor sorrow that he hath had but only that</a>
<a id='line_25675'>thing that he beholdeth before him. And as for this sword there shall</a>
<a id='line_25676'>never man begrip him at the handles but one; but he shall pass all</a>
<a id='line_25677'>other. In the name of God, said Percivale, I shall assay to handle it.</a>
<a id='line_25678'>So he set his hand to the sword, but he might not begrip it. By my</a>
<a id='line_25679'>faith, said he, now have I failed. Bors set his hand thereto and</a>
<a id='line_25680'>failed.</a>
<a id='line_25681'></a>
<a id='line_25682'>Then Galahad beheld the sword and saw letters like blood that said: Let</a>
<a id='line_25683'>see who shall assay to draw me out of my sheath, but if he be more</a>
<a id='line_25684'>hardier than any other; and who that draweth me, wit ye well that he</a>
<a id='line_25685'>shall never fail of shame of his body, or to be wounded to the death.</a>
<a id='line_25686'>By my faith, said Galahad, I would draw this sword out of the sheath,</a>
<a id='line_25687'>but the offending is so great that I shall not set my hand thereto. Now</a>
<a id='line_25688'>sirs, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well that the drawing of this sword</a>
<a id='line_25689'>is warned to all men save all only to you. Also this ship arrived in</a>
<a id='line_25690'>the realm of Logris; and that time was deadly war between King Labor,</a>
<a id='line_25691'>which was father unto the maimed king, and King Hurlame, which was a</a>
<a id='line_25692'>Saracen. But then was he newly christened, so that men held him</a>
<a id='line_25693'>afterward one of the wittiest men of the world. And so upon a day it</a>
<a id='line_25694'>befell that King Labor and King Hurlame had assembled their folk upon</a>
<a id='line_25695'>the sea where this ship was arrived; and there King Hurlame was</a>
<a id='line_25696'>discomfit, and his men slain; and he was afeard to be dead, and fled to</a>
<a id='line_25697'>his ship, and there found this sword and drew it, and came out and</a>
<a id='line_25698'>found King Labor, the man in the world of all Christendom in whom was</a>
<a id='line_25699'>then the greatest faith. And when King Hurlame saw King Labor he</a>
<a id='line_25700'>dressed this sword, and smote him upon the helm so hard that he clave</a>
<a id='line_25701'>him and his horse to the earth with the first stroke of his sword. And</a>
<a id='line_25702'>it was in the realm of Logris; and so befell great pestilence and great</a>
<a id='line_25703'>harm to both realms. For sithen increased neither corn, nor grass, nor</a>
<a id='line_25704'>well-nigh no fruit, nor in the water was no fish; wherefore men call it</a>
<a id='line_25705'>the lands of the two marches, the waste land, for that dolorous stroke.</a>
<a id='line_25706'>And when King Hurlame saw this sword so carving, he turned again to</a>
<a id='line_25707'>fetch the scabbard, and so came into this ship and entered, and put up</a>
<a id='line_25708'>the sword in the sheath. And as soon as he had done it he fell down</a>
<a id='line_25709'>dead afore the bed. Thus was the sword proved, that none ne drew it but</a>
<a id='line_25710'>he were dead or maimed. So lay he there till a maiden came into the</a>
<a id='line_25711'>ship and cast him out, for there was no man so hardy of the world to</a>
<a id='line_25712'>enter into that ship for the defence.</a>

<a id='line_25718'></a>
<a id='line_25719'></a>
<a id='line_25720'>And then beheld they the scabbard, it seemed to be of a serpent’s skin,</a>
<a id='line_25721'>and thereon were letters of gold and silver. And the girdle was but</a>
<a id='line_25722'>poorly to come to, and not able to sustain such a rich sword. And the</a>
<a id='line_25723'>letters said: He which shall wield me sought to be more harder than any</a>
<a id='line_25724'>other, if he bear me as truly as me ought to be borne. For the body of</a>
<a id='line_25725'>him which I ought to hang by, he shall not be shamed in no place while</a>
<a id='line_25726'>he is girt with this girdle, nor never none be so hardy to do away this</a>
<a id='line_25727'>girdle; for it ought not be done away but by the hands of a maid, and</a>
<a id='line_25728'>that she be a king’s daughter and queen’s, and she must be a maid all</a>
<a id='line_25729'>the days of her life, both in will and in deed. And if she break her</a>
<a id='line_25730'>virginity she shall die the most villainous death that ever died any</a>
<a id='line_25731'>woman. Sir, said Percivale, turn this sword that we may see what is on</a>
<a id='line_25732'>the other side. And it was red as blood, with black letters as any</a>
<a id='line_25733'>coal, which said: He that shall praise me most, most shall he find me</a>
<a id='line_25734'>to blame at a great need; and to whom I should be most debonair shall I</a>
<a id='line_25735'>be most felon, and that shall be at one time.</a>
<a id='line_25736'></a>
<a id='line_25737'>Fair brother, said she to Percivale, it befell after a forty year after</a>
<a id='line_25738'>the passion of Jesu Christ that Nacien, the brother-in-law of King</a>
<a id='line_25739'>Mordrains, was borne into a town more than fourteen days’ journey from</a>
<a id='line_25740'>his country, by the commandment of Our Lord, into an isle, into the</a>
<a id='line_25741'>parts of the West, that men cleped the Isle of Turnance. So befell it</a>
<a id='line_25742'>that he found this ship at the entry of a rock, and he found the bed</a>
<a id='line_25743'>and this sword as we have heard now. Not for then he had not so much</a>
<a id='line_25744'>hardiness to draw it; and there he dwelled an eight days, and at the</a>
<a id='line_25745'>ninth day there fell a great wind which departed him out of the isle,</a>
<a id='line_25746'>and brought him to another isle by a rock, and there he found the</a>
<a id='line_25747'>greatest giant that ever man might see. Therewith came that horrible</a>
<a id='line_25748'>giant to slay him; and then he looked about him and might not flee, and</a>
<a id='line_25749'>he had nothing to defend him with. So he ran to his sword, and when he</a>
<a id='line_25750'>saw it naked he praised it much, and then he shook it, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_25751'>brake it in the midst. Ah, said Nacien, the thing that I most praised</a>
<a id='line_25752'>ought I now most to blame, and therewith he threw the pieces of his</a>
<a id='line_25753'>sword over his bed. And after he leapt over the board to fight with the</a>
<a id='line_25754'>giant, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_25755'></a>
<a id='line_25756'>And anon he entered into the ship again, and the wind arose, and drove</a>
<a id='line_25757'>him through the sea, that by adventure he came to another ship where</a>
<a id='line_25758'>King Mordrains was, which had been tempted full evil with a fiend in</a>
<a id='line_25759'>the Port of Perilous Rock. And when that one saw the other they made</a>
<a id='line_25760'>great joy of other, and either told other of their adventure, and how</a>
<a id='line_25761'>the sword failed him at his most need. When Mordrains saw the sword he</a>
<a id='line_25762'>praised it much: But the breaking was not to do but by wickedness of</a>
<a id='line_25763'>thy selfward, for thou art in some sin. And there he took the sword,</a>
<a id='line_25764'>and set the pieces together, and they soldered as fair as ever they</a>
<a id='line_25765'>were to-fore; and there put he the sword in the sheath, and laid it</a>
<a id='line_25766'>down on the bed. Then heard they a voice that said: Go out of this ship</a>
<a id='line_25767'>a little while, and enter into the other, for dread ye fall in deadly</a>
<a id='line_25768'>sin, for and ye be found in deadly sin ye may not escape but perish:</a>
<a id='line_25769'>and so they went into the other ship. And as Nacien went over the board</a>
<a id='line_25770'>he was smitten with a sword on the right foot, that he fell down</a>
<a id='line_25771'>noseling to the ship’s board; and therewith he said: O God, how am I</a>
<a id='line_25772'>hurt. And then there came a voice and said: Take thou that for thy</a>
<a id='line_25773'>forfeit that thou didst in drawing of this sword, therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_25774'>receivest a wound, for thou were never worthy to handle it, as the</a>
<a id='line_25775'>writing maketh mention. In the name of God, said Galahad, ye are right</a>
<a id='line_25776'>wise of these works.</a>
<a id='line_25777'></a>
<a id='line_25778'></a>
<a id='line_25779'></a>
<a id='line_25780'></a>
<a id='line_25781'>CHAPTER V. How King Pelles was smitten through both thighs because he</a>
<a id='line_25782'>drew the sword, and other marvellous histories.</a>
<a id='line_25783'></a>
<a id='line_25784'></a>
<a id='line_25785'>Sir, said she, there was a king that hight Pelles, the maimed king. And</a>
<a id='line_25786'>while he might ride he supported much Christendom and Holy Church. So</a>
<a id='line_25787'>upon a day he hunted in a wood of his which lasted unto the sea; and at</a>
<a id='line_25788'>the last he lost his hounds and his knights save only one: and there he</a>
<a id='line_25789'>and his knight went till that they came toward Ireland, and there he</a>
<a id='line_25790'>found the ship. And when he saw the letters and understood them, yet he</a>
<a id='line_25791'>entered, for he was right perfect of his life, but his knight had none</a>
<a id='line_25792'>hardiness to enter; and there found he this sword, and drew it out as</a>
<a id='line_25793'>much as ye may see. So therewith entered a spear wherewith he was</a>
<a id='line_25794'>smitten him through both the thighs, and never sith might he be healed,</a>
<a id='line_25795'>nor nought shall to-fore we come to him. Thus, said she, was not King</a>
<a id='line_25796'>Pelles, your grandsire, maimed for his hardiness? In the name of God,</a>
<a id='line_25797'>damosel, said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_25798'></a>
<a id='line_25799'>So they went toward the bed to behold all about it, and above the head</a>
<a id='line_25800'>there hung two swords. Also there were two spindles which were as white</a>
<a id='line_25801'>as any snow, and other that were as red as blood, and other above green</a>
<a id='line_25802'>as any emerald: of these three colours were the spindles, and of</a>
<a id='line_25803'>natural colour within, and without any painting. These spindles, said</a>
<a id='line_25804'>the damosel, were when sinful Eve came to gather fruit, for which Adam</a>
<a id='line_25805'>and she were put out of paradise, she took with her the bough on which</a>
<a id='line_25806'>the apple hung on. Then perceived she that the branch was fair and</a>
<a id='line_25807'>green, and she remembered her the loss which came from the tree. Then</a>
<a id='line_25808'>she thought to keep the branch as long as she might. And for she had no</a>
<a id='line_25809'>coffer to keep it in, she put it in the earth. So by the will of Our</a>
<a id='line_25810'>Lord the branch grew to a great tree within a little while, and was as</a>
<a id='line_25811'>white as any snow, branches, boughs, and leaves: that was a token a</a>
<a id='line_25812'>maiden planted it. But after God came to Adam, and bade him know his</a>
<a id='line_25813'>wife fleshly as nature required. So lay Adam with his wife under the</a>
<a id='line_25814'>same tree; and anon the tree which was white was full green as any</a>
<a id='line_25815'>grass, and all that came out of it; and in the same time that they</a>
<a id='line_25816'>medled together there was Abel begotten: thus was the tree long of</a>
<a id='line_25817'>green colour. And so it befell many days after, under the same tree</a>
<a id='line_25818'>Caym slew Abel, whereof befell great marvel. For anon as Abel had</a>
<a id='line_25819'>received the death under the green tree, it lost the green colour and</a>
<a id='line_25820'>became red; and that was in tokening of the blood. And anon all the</a>
<a id='line_25821'>plants died thereof, but the tree grew and waxed marvellously fair, and</a>
<a id='line_25822'>it was the fairest tree and the most delectable that any man might</a>
<a id='line_25823'>behold and see; and so died the plants that grew out of it to-fore that</a>
<a id='line_25824'>Abel was slain under it. So long dured the tree till that Solomon, King</a>
<a id='line_25825'>David’s son, reigned, and held the land after his father. This Solomon</a>
<a id='line_25826'>was wise and knew all the virtues of stones and trees, and so he knew</a>
<a id='line_25827'>the course of the stars, and many other divers things. This Solomon had</a>
<a id='line_25828'>an evil wife, wherethrough he weened that there had been no good woman,</a>
<a id='line_25829'>and so he despised them in his books. So answered a voice him once:</a>
<a id='line_25830'>Solomon, if heaviness come to a man by a woman, ne reck thou never; for</a>
<a id='line_25831'>yet shall there come a woman whereof there shall come greater joy to</a>
<a id='line_25832'>man an hundred times more than this heaviness giveth sorrow; and that</a>
<a id='line_25833'>woman shall be born of thy lineage. Tho when Solomon heard these words</a>
<a id='line_25834'>he held himself but a fool, and the truth he perceived by old books.</a>
<a id='line_25835'>Also the Holy Ghost showed him the coming of the glorious Virgin Mary.</a>
<a id='line_25836'>Then asked he of the voice, if it should be in the yerde of his</a>
<a id='line_25837'>lineage. Nay, said the voice, but there shall come a man which shall be</a>
<a id='line_25838'>a maid, and the last of your blood, and he shall be as good a knight as</a>
<a id='line_25839'>Duke Josua, thy brother-in-law.</a>
<a id='line_25840'></a>
<a id='line_25841'></a>
<a id='line_25842'></a>
<a id='line_25843'></a>
<a id='line_25844'>CHAPTER VI. How Solomon took David’s sword by the counsel of his wife,</a>
<a id='line_25845'>and of other matters marvellous.</a>
<a id='line_25846'></a>
<a id='line_25847'></a>
<a id='line_25848'>Now have I certified thee of that thou stoodest in doubt. Then was</a>
<a id='line_25849'>Solomon glad that there should come any such of his lineage; but ever</a>
<a id='line_25850'>he marvelled and studied who that should be, and what his name might</a>
<a id='line_25851'>be. His wife perceived that he studied, and thought she would know it</a>
<a id='line_25852'>at some season; and so she waited her time, and asked of him the cause</a>
<a id='line_25853'>of his studying, and there he told her altogether how the voice told</a>
<a id='line_25854'>him. Well, said she, I shall let make a ship of the best wood and most</a>
<a id='line_25855'>durable that men may find. So Solomon sent for all the carpenters of</a>
<a id='line_25856'>the land, and the best. And when they had made the ship the lady said</a>
<a id='line_25857'>to Solomon: Sir, said she, since it is so that this knight ought to</a>
<a id='line_25858'>pass all knights of chivalry which have been to-fore him and shall come</a>
<a id='line_25859'>after him, moreover I shall tell you, said she, ye shall go into Our</a>
<a id='line_25860'>Lord’s temple, where is King David’s sword, your father, the which is</a>
<a id='line_25861'>the marvelloust and the sharpest that ever was taken in any knight’s</a>
<a id='line_25862'>hand. Therefore take that, and take off the pommel, and thereto make ye</a>
<a id='line_25863'>a pommel of precious stones, that it be so subtly made that no man</a>
<a id='line_25864'>perceive it but that they be all one; and after make there an hilt so</a>
<a id='line_25865'>marvellously and wonderly that no man may know it; and after make a</a>
<a id='line_25866'>marvellous sheath. And when ye have made all this I shall let make a</a>
<a id='line_25867'>girdle thereto, such as shall please me.</a>
<a id='line_25868'></a>
<a id='line_25869'>All this King Solomon did let make as she devised, both the ship and</a>
<a id='line_25870'>all the remnant. And when the ship was ready in the sea to sail, the</a>
<a id='line_25871'>lady let make a great bed and marvellous rich, and set her upon the</a>
<a id='line_25872'>bed’s head, covered with silk, and laid the sword at the feet, and the</a>
<a id='line_25873'>girdles were of hemp, and therewith the king was angry. Sir, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_25874'>well, said she, that I have none so high a thing which were worthy to</a>
<a id='line_25875'>sustain so high a sword, and a maid shall bring other knights thereto,</a>
<a id='line_25876'>but I wot not when it shall be, nor what time. And there she let make a</a>
<a id='line_25877'>covering to the ship, of cloth of silk that should never rot for no</a>
<a id='line_25878'>manner of weather. Yet went that lady and made a carpenter to come to</a>
<a id='line_25879'>the tree which Abel was slain under. Now, said she, carve me out of</a>
<a id='line_25880'>this tree as much wood as will make me a spindle. Ah madam, said he,</a>
<a id='line_25881'>this is the tree the which our first mother planted. Do it, said she,</a>
<a id='line_25882'>or else I shall destroy thee. Anon as he began to work there came out</a>
<a id='line_25883'>drops of blood; and then would he have left, but she would not suffer</a>
<a id='line_25884'>him, and so he took away as much wood as might make a spindle: and so</a>
<a id='line_25885'>she made him to take as much of the green tree and of the white tree.</a>
<a id='line_25886'>And when these three spindles were shapen she made them to be fastened</a>
<a id='line_25887'>upon the selar of the bed. When Solomon saw this, he said to his wife:</a>
<a id='line_25888'>Ye have done marvellously, for though all the world were here right</a>
<a id='line_25889'>now, he could not devise wherefore all this was made, but Our Lord</a>
<a id='line_25890'>Himself; and thou that hast done it wottest not what it shall betoken.</a>
<a id='line_25891'>Now let it be, said she, for ye shall hear tidings sooner than ye ween.</a>
<a id='line_25892'>Now shall ye hear a wonderful tale of King Solomon and his wife.</a>
<a id='line_25893'></a>

<a id='line_25897'>CHAPTER VII. A wonderful tale of King Solomon and his wife.</a>
<a id='line_25898'></a>
<a id='line_25899'></a>
<a id='line_25900'>That night lay Solomon before the ship with little fellowship. And when</a>
<a id='line_25901'>he was asleep him thought there came from heaven a great company of</a>
<a id='line_25902'>angels, and alighted into the ship, and took water which was brought by</a>
<a id='line_25903'>an angel, in a vessel of silver, and sprent all the ship. And after he</a>
<a id='line_25904'>came to the sword, and drew letters on the hilt. And after went to the</a>
<a id='line_25905'>ship’s board, and wrote there other letters which said: Thou man that</a>
<a id='line_25906'>wilt enter within me, beware that thou be full within the faith, for I</a>
<a id='line_25907'>ne am but Faith and Belief. When Solomon espied these letters he was</a>
<a id='line_25908'>abashed, so that he durst not enter, and so drew him aback; and the</a>
<a id='line_25909'>ship was anon shoven in the sea, and he went so fast that he lost sight</a>
<a id='line_25910'>of him within a little while. And then a little voice said: Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_25911'>the last knight of thy lineage shall rest in this bed. Then went</a>
<a id='line_25912'>Solomon and awaked his wife, and told her of the adventures of the</a>
<a id='line_25913'>ship.</a>
<a id='line_25914'></a>
<a id='line_25915'>Now saith the history that a great while the three fellows beheld the</a>
<a id='line_25916'>bed and the three spindles. Then they were at certain that they were of</a>
<a id='line_25917'>natural colours without painting. Then they lift up a cloth which was</a>
<a id='line_25918'>above the ground, and there found a rich purse by seeming. And</a>
<a id='line_25919'>Percivale took it, and found therein a writ and so he read it, and</a>
<a id='line_25920'>devised the manner of the spindles and of the ship, whence it came, and</a>
<a id='line_25921'>by whom it was made. Now, said Galahad, where shall we find the</a>
<a id='line_25922'>gentlewoman that shall make new girdles to the sword? Fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_25923'>Percivale’s sister, dismay you not, for by the leave of God I shall let</a>
<a id='line_25924'>make a girdle to the sword, such one as shall long thereto. And then</a>
<a id='line_25925'>she opened a box, and took out girdles which were seemly wrought with</a>
<a id='line_25926'>golden threads, and upon that were set full precious stones, and a rich</a>
<a id='line_25927'>buckle of gold. Lo, lords, said she, here is a girdle that ought to be</a>
<a id='line_25928'>set about the sword. And wit ye well the greatest part of this girdle</a>
<a id='line_25929'>was made of my hair, which I loved well while that I was a woman of the</a>
<a id='line_25930'>world. But as soon as I wist that this adventure was ordained me I</a>
<a id='line_25931'>clipped off my hair, and made this girdle in the name of God. Ye be</a>
<a id='line_25932'>well found, said Sir Bors, for certes ye have put us out of great pain,</a>
<a id='line_25933'>wherein we should have entered ne had your tidings been.</a>
<a id='line_25934'></a>
<a id='line_25935'>Then went the gentlewoman and set it on the girdle of the sword. Now,</a>
<a id='line_25936'>said the fellowship, what is the name of the sword, and what shall we</a>
<a id='line_25937'>call it? Truly, said she, the name of the sword is the Sword with the</a>
<a id='line_25938'>Strange Girdles; and the sheath, Mover of Blood; for no man that hath</a>
<a id='line_25939'>blood in him ne shall never see the one part of the sheath which was</a>
<a id='line_25940'>made of the Tree of Life. Then they said to Galahad: In the name of</a>
<a id='line_25941'>Jesu Christ, and pray you that ye gird you with this sword which hath</a>
<a id='line_25942'>been desired so much in the realm of Logris. Now let me begin, said</a>
<a id='line_25943'>Galahad, to grip this sword for to give you courage; but wit ye well it</a>
<a id='line_25944'>longeth no more to me than it doth to you. And then he gripped about it</a>
<a id='line_25945'>with his fingers a great deal; and then she girt him about the middle</a>
<a id='line_25946'>with the sword. Now reck I not though I die, for now I hold me one of</a>
<a id='line_25947'>the blessed maidens of the world, which hath made the worthiest knight</a>
<a id='line_25948'>of the world. Damosel, said Galahad, ye have done so much that I shall</a>
<a id='line_25949'>be your knight all the days of my life.</a>
<a id='line_25950'></a>
<a id='line_25951'>Then they went from that ship, and went to the other. And anon the wind</a>
<a id='line_25952'>drove them into the sea a great pace, but they had no victuals: but it</a>
<a id='line_25953'>befell that they came on the morn to a castle that men call Carteloise,</a>
<a id='line_25954'>that was in the marches of Scotland. And when they had passed the port,</a>
<a id='line_25955'>the gentlewoman said: Lords, here be men arriven that, an they wist</a>
<a id='line_25956'>that ye were of King Arthur’s court, ye should be assailed anon.</a>
<a id='line_25957'>Damosel, said Galahad, He that cast us out of the rock shall deliver us</a>
<a id='line_25958'>from them.</a>
<a id='line_25959'></a>
<a id='line_25960'></a>

<a id='line_25962'></a>
<a id='line_25963'>CHAPTER VIII. How Galahad and his fellows came to a castle, and how</a>
<a id='line_25964'>they were fought withal, and how they slew their adversaries, and other</a>
<a id='line_25965'>matters.</a>
<a id='line_25966'></a>
<a id='line_25967'></a>
<a id='line_25968'>So it befell as they spoke thus there came a squire by them, and asked</a>
<a id='line_25969'>what they were; and they said they were of King Arthur’s house. Is that</a>
<a id='line_25970'>sooth? said he. Now by my head, said he, ye be ill arrayed; and then</a>
<a id='line_25971'>turned he again unto the cliff fortress. And within a while they heard</a>
<a id='line_25972'>an horn blow. Then a gentlewoman came to them, and asked them of whence</a>
<a id='line_25973'>they were; and they told her. Fair lords, said she, for God’s love turn</a>
<a id='line_25974'>again if ye may, for ye be come unto your death. Nay, they said, we</a>
<a id='line_25975'>will not turn again, for He shall help us in whose service we be</a>
<a id='line_25976'>entered in. Then as they stood talking there came knights well armed,</a>
<a id='line_25977'>and bade them yield them or else to die. That yielding, said they,</a>
<a id='line_25978'>shall be noyous to you. And therewith they let their horses run, and</a>
<a id='line_25979'>Sir Percivale smote the foremost to the earth, and took his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_25980'>mounted thereupon, and the same did Galahad. Also Bors served another</a>
<a id='line_25981'>so, for they had no horses in that country, for they left their horses</a>
<a id='line_25982'>when they took their ship in other countries. And so when they were</a>
<a id='line_25983'>horsed then began they to set upon them; and they of the castle fled</a>
<a id='line_25984'>into the strong fortress, and the three knights after them into the</a>
<a id='line_25985'>castle, and so alighted on foot, and with their swords slew them down,</a>
<a id='line_25986'>and gat into the hall.</a>
<a id='line_25987'></a>
<a id='line_25988'>Then when they beheld the great multitude of people that they had</a>
<a id='line_25989'>slain, they held themself great sinners. Certes, said Bors, I ween an</a>
<a id='line_25990'>God had loved them that we should not have had power to have slain them</a>
<a id='line_25991'>thus. But they have done so much against Our Lord that He would not</a>
<a id='line_25992'>suffer them to reign no longer. Say ye not so, said Galahad, for if</a>
<a id='line_25993'>they misdid against God, the vengeance is not ours, but to Him which</a>
<a id='line_25994'>hath power thereof.</a>
<a id='line_25995'></a>
<a id='line_25996'>So came there out of a chamber a good man which was a priest, and bare</a>
<a id='line_25997'>God’s body in a cup. And when he saw them which lay dead in the hall he</a>
<a id='line_25998'>was all abashed; and Galahad did off his helm and kneeled down, and so</a>
<a id='line_25999'>did his two fellows. Sir, said they, have ye no dread of us, for we be</a>
<a id='line_26000'>of King Arthur’s court. Then asked the good man how they were slain so</a>
<a id='line_26001'>suddenly, and they told it him. Truly, said the good man, an ye might</a>
<a id='line_26002'>live as long as the world might endure, ne might ye have done so great</a>
<a id='line_26003'>an alms-deed as this. Sir, said Galahad, I repent me much, inasmuch as</a>
<a id='line_26004'>they were christened. Nay, repent you not, said he, for they were not</a>
<a id='line_26005'>christened, and I shall tell you how that I wot of this castle. Here</a>
<a id='line_26006'>was Lord Earl Hernox not but one year, and he had three sons, good</a>
<a id='line_26007'>knights of arms, and a daughter, the fairest gentlewoman that men knew.</a>
<a id='line_26008'>So those three knights loved their sister so sore that they brent in</a>
<a id='line_26009'>love, and so they lay by her, maugre her head. And for she cried to her</a>
<a id='line_26010'>father they slew her, and took their father and put him in prison, and</a>
<a id='line_26011'>wounded him nigh to the death, but a cousin of hers rescued him. And</a>
<a id='line_26012'>then did they great untruth: they slew clerks and priests, and made</a>
<a id='line_26013'>beat down chapels, that Our Lord’s service might not be served nor</a>
<a id='line_26014'>said. And this same day her father sent to me for to be confessed and</a>
<a id='line_26015'>houseled; but such shame had never man as I had this day with the three</a>
<a id='line_26016'>brethren, but the earl bade me suffer, for he said they should not long</a>
<a id='line_26017'>endure, for three servants of Our Lord should destroy them, and now it</a>
<a id='line_26018'>is brought to an end. And by this may ye wit that Our Lord is not</a>
<a id='line_26019'>displeased with your deeds. Certes, said Galahad, an it had not pleased</a>
<a id='line_26020'>Our Lord, never should we have slain so many men in so little a while.</a>
<a id='line_26021'></a>
<a id='line_26022'>And then they brought the Earl Hernox out of prison into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_26023'>the hall, that knew Galahad anon, and yet he saw him never afore but by</a>
<a id='line_26024'>revelation of Our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_26025'></a>
<a id='line_26026'></a>
<a id='line_26027'></a>
<a id='line_26028'></a>
<a id='line_26029'>CHAPTER IX. How the three knights, with Percivale’s sister, came unto</a>
<a id='line_26030'>the same forest, and of an hart and four lions, and other things.</a>
<a id='line_26031'></a>
<a id='line_26032'></a>
<a id='line_26033'>Then began he to weep right tenderly, and said: Long have I abiden your</a>
<a id='line_26034'>coming, but for God’s love hold me in your arms, that my soul may</a>
<a id='line_26035'>depart out of my body in so good a man’s arms as ye be. Gladly, said</a>
<a id='line_26036'>Galahad. And then one said on high, that all heard: Galahad, well hast</a>
<a id='line_26037'>thou avenged me on God’s enemies. Now behoveth thee to go to the Maimed</a>
<a id='line_26038'>King as soon as thou mayest, for he shall receive by thee health which</a>
<a id='line_26039'>he hath abiden so long. And therewith the soul departed from the body,</a>
<a id='line_26040'>and Galahad made him to be buried as him ought to be.</a>
<a id='line_26041'></a>
<a id='line_26042'>Right so departed the three knights, and Percivale’s sister with them.</a>
<a id='line_26043'>And so they came into a waste forest, and there they saw afore them a</a>
<a id='line_26044'>white hart which four lions led. Then they took them to assent for to</a>
<a id='line_26045'>follow after for to know whither they repaired; and so they rode after</a>
<a id='line_26046'>a great pace till that they came to a valley, and thereby was an</a>
<a id='line_26047'>hermitage where a good man dwelled, and the hart and the lions entered</a>
<a id='line_26048'>also. So when they saw all this they turned to the chapel, and saw the</a>
<a id='line_26049'>good man in a religious weed and in the armour of Our Lord, for he</a>
<a id='line_26050'>would sing mass of the Holy Ghost; and so they entered in and heard</a>
<a id='line_26051'>mass. And at the secrets of the mass they three saw the hart become a</a>
<a id='line_26052'>man, the which marvelled them, and set him upon the altar in a rich</a>
<a id='line_26053'>siege; and saw the four lions were changed, the one to the form of a</a>
<a id='line_26054'>man, the other to the form of a lion, and the third to an eagle, and</a>
<a id='line_26055'>the fourth was changed unto an ox. Then took they their siege where the</a>
<a id='line_26056'>hart sat, and went out through a glass window, and there was nothing</a>
<a id='line_26057'>perished nor broken; and they heard a voice say: In such a manner</a>
<a id='line_26058'>entered the Son of God in the womb of a maid Mary, whose virginity ne</a>
<a id='line_26059'>was perished ne hurt. And when they heard these words they fell down to</a>
<a id='line_26060'>the earth and were astonied; and therewith was a great clearness.</a>
<a id='line_26061'></a>
<a id='line_26062'>And when they were come to theirself again they went to the good man</a>
<a id='line_26063'>and prayed him that he would say them truth. What thing have ye seen?</a>
<a id='line_26064'>said he. And they told him all that they had seen. Ah lords, said he,</a>
<a id='line_26065'>ye be welcome; now wot I well ye be the good knights the which shall</a>
<a id='line_26066'>bring the Sangreal to an end; for ye be they unto whom Our Lord shall</a>
<a id='line_26067'>shew great secrets. And well ought Our Lord be signified to an hart,</a>
<a id='line_26068'>for the hart when he is old he waxeth young again in his white skin.</a>
<a id='line_26069'>Right so cometh again Our Lord from death to life, for He lost earthly</a>
<a id='line_26070'>flesh that was the deadly flesh, which He had taken in the womb of the</a>
<a id='line_26071'>blessed Virgin Mary; and for that cause appeared Our Lord as a white</a>
<a id='line_26072'>hart without spot. And the four that were with Him is to understand the</a>
<a id='line_26073'>four evangelists which set in writing a part of Jesu Christ’s deeds</a>
<a id='line_26074'>that He did sometime when He was among you an earthly man; for wit ye</a>
<a id='line_26075'>well never erst ne might no knight know the truth, for ofttimes or this</a>
<a id='line_26076'>Our Lord showed Him unto good men and unto good knights, in likeness of</a>
<a id='line_26077'>an hart, but I suppose from henceforth ye shall see no more. And then</a>
<a id='line_26078'>they joyed much, and dwelled there all that day. And upon the morrow</a>
<a id='line_26079'>when they had heard mass they departed and commended the good man to</a>
<a id='line_26080'>God: and so they came to a castle and passed by. So there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_26081'>armed after them and said: Lords, hark what I shall say to you.</a>
<a id='line_26082'></a>
<a id='line_26083'></a>
<a id='line_26084'></a>
<a id='line_26085'></a>
<a id='line_26086'>CHAPTER X. How they were desired of a strange custom, the which they</a>
<a id='line_26087'>would not obey; wherefore they fought and slew many knights.</a>
<a id='line_26088'></a>
<a id='line_26089'></a>
<a id='line_26090'>This gentlewoman that ye lead with you is a maid? Sir, said she, a maid</a>
<a id='line_26091'>I am. Then he took her by the bridle and said: By the Holy Cross, ye</a>
<a id='line_26092'>shall not escape me to-fore ye have yolden the custom of this castle.</a>
<a id='line_26093'>Let her go, said Percivale, ye be not wise, for a maid in what place</a>
<a id='line_26094'>she cometh is free. So in the meanwhile there came out a ten or twelve</a>
<a id='line_26095'>knights armed, out of the castle, and with them came gentlewomen which</a>
<a id='line_26096'>held a dish of silver. And then they said: This gentlewoman must yield</a>
<a id='line_26097'>us the custom of this castle. Sir, said a knight, what maid passeth</a>
<a id='line_26098'>hereby shall give this dish full of blood of her right arm. Blame have</a>
<a id='line_26099'>ye, said Galahad, that brought up such customs, and so God me save, I</a>
<a id='line_26100'>ensure you of this gentlewoman ye shall fail while that I live. So God</a>
<a id='line_26101'>me help, said Percivale, I had liefer be slain. And I also, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_26102'>Bors. By my troth, said the knight, then shall ye die, for ye may not</a>
<a id='line_26103'>endure against us though ye were the best knights of the world.</a>
<a id='line_26104'></a>
<a id='line_26105'>Then let they run each to other, and the three fellows beat the ten</a>
<a id='line_26106'>knights, and then set their hands to their swords and beat them down</a>
<a id='line_26107'>and slew them. Then there came out of the castle a three score knights</a>
<a id='line_26108'>armed. Fair lords, said the three fellows, have mercy on yourself and</a>
<a id='line_26109'>have not ado with us. Nay, fair lords, said the knights of the castle,</a>
<a id='line_26110'>we counsel you to withdraw you, for ye be the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_26111'>world, and therefore do no more, for ye have done enough. We will let</a>
<a id='line_26112'>you go with this harm, but we must needs have the custom. Certes, said</a>
<a id='line_26113'>Galahad, for nought speak ye. Well, said they, will ye die? We be not</a>
<a id='line_26114'>yet come thereto, said Galahad. Then began they to meddle together, and</a>
<a id='line_26115'>Galahad, with the strange girdles, drew his sword, and smote on the</a>
<a id='line_26116'>right hand and on the left hand, and slew what that ever abode him, and</a>
<a id='line_26117'>did such marvels that there was none that saw him but weened he had</a>
<a id='line_26118'>been none earthly man, but a monster. And his two fellows halp him</a>
<a id='line_26119'>passing well, and so they held the journey everych in like hard till it</a>
<a id='line_26120'>was night: then must they needs depart.</a>
<a id='line_26121'></a>
<a id='line_26122'>So came in a good knight, and said to the three fellows: If ye will</a>
<a id='line_26123'>come in to-night and take such harbour as here is ye shall be right</a>
<a id='line_26124'>welcome, and we shall ensure you by the faith of our bodies, and as we</a>
<a id='line_26125'>be true knights, to leave you in such estate to-morrow as we find you,</a>
<a id='line_26126'>without any falsehood. And as soon as ye know of the custom we dare say</a>
<a id='line_26127'>ye will accord therefore. For God’s love, said the gentlewoman, go</a>
<a id='line_26128'>thither and spare not for me. Go we, said Galahad; and so they entered</a>
<a id='line_26129'>into the chapel. And when they were alighted they made great joy of</a>
<a id='line_26130'>them. So within a while the three knights asked the custom of the</a>
<a id='line_26131'>castle and wherefore it was. What it is, said they, we will say you</a>
<a id='line_26132'>sooth.</a>
<a id='line_26133'></a>

<a id='line_26137'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Percivale’s sister bled a dish full of blood for to</a>
<a id='line_26138'>heal a lady, wherefore she died; and how that the body was put in a</a>
<a id='line_26139'>ship.</a>
<a id='line_26140'></a>
<a id='line_26141'></a>
<a id='line_26142'>There is in this castle a gentlewoman which we and this castle is hers,</a>
<a id='line_26143'>and many other. So it befell many years agone there fell upon her a</a>
<a id='line_26144'>malady; and when she had lain a great while she fell unto a measle, and</a>
<a id='line_26145'>of no leech she could have no remedy. But at the last an old man said</a>
<a id='line_26146'>an she might have a dish full of blood of a maid and a clean virgin in</a>
<a id='line_26147'>will and in work, and a king’s daughter, that blood should be her</a>
<a id='line_26148'>health, and for to anoint her withal; and for this thing was this</a>
<a id='line_26149'>custom made. Now, said Percivale’s sister, fair knights, I see well</a>
<a id='line_26150'>that this gentlewoman is but dead. Certes, said Galahad, an ye bleed so</a>
<a id='line_26151'>much ye may die. Truly, said she, an I die for to heal her I shall get</a>
<a id='line_26152'>me great worship and soul’s health, and worship to my lineage, and</a>
<a id='line_26153'>better is one harm than twain. And therefore there shall be no more</a>
<a id='line_26154'>battle, but to-morn I shall yield you your custom of this castle. And</a>
<a id='line_26155'>then there was great joy more than there was to-fore, for else had</a>
<a id='line_26156'>there been mortal war upon the morn; notwithstanding she would none</a>
<a id='line_26157'>other, whether they wold or nold.</a>
<a id='line_26158'></a>
<a id='line_26159'>That night were the three fellows eased with the best; and on the morn</a>
<a id='line_26160'>they heard mass, and Sir Percivale’s sister bade bring forth the sick</a>
<a id='line_26161'>lady. So she was, the which was evil at ease. Then said she: Who shall</a>
<a id='line_26162'>let me blood? So one came forth and let her blood, and she bled so much</a>
<a id='line_26163'>that the dish was full. Then she lift up her hand and blessed her; and</a>
<a id='line_26164'>then she said to the lady: Madam, I am come to the death for to make</a>
<a id='line_26165'>you whole, for God’s love pray for me. With that she fell in a swoon.</a>
<a id='line_26166'>Then Galahad and his two fellows start up to her, and lift her up and</a>
<a id='line_26167'>staunched her, but she had bled so much that she might not live. Then</a>
<a id='line_26168'>she said when she was awaked: Fair brother Percivale, I die for the</a>
<a id='line_26169'>healing of this lady, so I require you that ye bury me not in this</a>
<a id='line_26170'>country, but as soon as I am dead put me in a boat at the next haven,</a>
<a id='line_26171'>and let me go as adventure will lead me; and as soon as ye three come</a>
<a id='line_26172'>to the City of Sarras, there to enchieve the Holy Grail, ye shall find</a>
<a id='line_26173'>me under a tower arrived, and there bury me in the spiritual place; for</a>
<a id='line_26174'>I say you so much, there Galahad shall be buried, and ye also, in the</a>
<a id='line_26175'>same place.</a>
<a id='line_26176'></a>
<a id='line_26177'>Then Percivale understood these words, and granted it her, weeping. And</a>
<a id='line_26178'>then said a voice: Lords and fellows, to-morrow at the hour of prime ye</a>
<a id='line_26179'>three shall depart everych from other, till the adventure bring you to</a>
<a id='line_26180'>the Maimed King. Then asked she her Saviour; and as soon as she had</a>
<a id='line_26181'>received it the soul departed from the body. So the same day was the</a>
<a id='line_26182'>lady healed, when she was anointed withal. Then Sir Percivale made a</a>
<a id='line_26183'>letter of all that she had holpen them as in strange adventures, and</a>
<a id='line_26184'>put it in her right hand, and so laid her in a barge, and covered it</a>
<a id='line_26185'>with black silk; and so the wind arose, and drove the barge from the</a>
<a id='line_26186'>land, and all knights beheld it till it was out of their sight. Then</a>
<a id='line_26187'>they drew all to the castle, and so forthwith there fell a sudden</a>
<a id='line_26188'>tempest and a thunder, lightning, and rain, as all the earth would have</a>
<a id='line_26189'>broken. So half the castle turned up-so-down. So it passed evensong or</a>
<a id='line_26190'>the tempest was ceased.</a>
<a id='line_26191'></a>
<a id='line_26192'>Then they saw afore them a knight armed and wounded hard in the body</a>
<a id='line_26193'>and in the head, that said: O God, succour me for now it is need. After</a>
<a id='line_26194'>this knight came another knight and a dwarf, which cried to them afar:</a>
<a id='line_26195'>Stand, ye may not escape. Then the wounded knight held up his hands to</a>
<a id='line_26196'>God that he should not die in such tribulation. Truly, said Galahad, I</a>
<a id='line_26197'>shall succour him for His sake that he calleth upon. Sir, said Bors, I</a>
<a id='line_26198'>shall do it, for it is not for you, for he is but one knight. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_26199'>he, I grant. So Sir Bors took his horse, and commended him to God, and</a>
<a id='line_26200'>rode after, to rescue the wounded knight. Now turn we to the two</a>
<a id='line_26201'>fellows.</a>

<a id='line_26206'>CHAPTER XII. How Galahad and Percivale found in a castle many tombs of</a>
<a id='line_26207'>maidens that had bled to death.</a>
<a id='line_26208'></a>
<a id='line_26209'></a>
<a id='line_26210'>Now saith the story that all night Galahad and Percivale were in a</a>
<a id='line_26211'>chapel in their prayers, for to save Sir Bors. So on the morrow they</a>
<a id='line_26212'>dressed them in their harness toward the castle, to wit what was fallen</a>
<a id='line_26213'>of them therein. And when they came there they found neither man nor</a>
<a id='line_26214'>woman that he ne was dead by the vengeance of Our Lord. With that they</a>
<a id='line_26215'>heard a voice that said: This vengeance is for blood-shedding of</a>
<a id='line_26216'>maidens. Also they found at the end of the chapel a churchyard, and</a>
<a id='line_26217'>therein might they see a three score fair tombs, and that place was so</a>
<a id='line_26218'>fair and so delectable that it seemed them there had been none tempest,</a>
<a id='line_26219'>for there lay the bodies of all the good maidens which were martyred</a>
<a id='line_26220'>for the sick lady’s sake. Also they found the names of everych, and of</a>
<a id='line_26221'>what blood they were come, and all were of kings’ blood, and twelve of</a>
<a id='line_26222'>them were kings’ daughters. Then they departed and went into a forest.</a>
<a id='line_26223'>Now, said Percivale unto Galahad, we must depart, so pray we Our Lord</a>
<a id='line_26224'>that we may meet together in short time: then they did off their helms</a>
<a id='line_26225'>and kissed together, and wept at their departing.</a>
<a id='line_26226'></a>

<a id='line_26230'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Launcelot entered into the ship where Sir</a>
<a id='line_26231'>Percivale’s sister lay dead, and how he met with Sir Galahad, his son.</a>
<a id='line_26232'></a>
<a id='line_26233'></a>
<a id='line_26234'>Now saith the history, that when Launcelot was come to the water of</a>
<a id='line_26235'>Mortoise, as it is rehearsed before, he was in great peril, and so he</a>
<a id='line_26236'>laid him down and slept, and took the adventure that God would send</a>
<a id='line_26237'>him. So when he was asleep there came a vision unto him and said:</a>
<a id='line_26238'>Launcelot, arise up and take thine armour, and enter into the first</a>
<a id='line_26239'>ship that thou shalt find. And when he heard these words he start up</a>
<a id='line_26240'>and saw great clearness about him. And then he lift up his hand and</a>
<a id='line_26241'>blessed him, and so took his arms and made him ready; and so by</a>
<a id='line_26242'>adventure he came by a strand, and found a ship the which was without</a>
<a id='line_26243'>sail or oar. And as soon as he was within the ship there he felt the</a>
<a id='line_26244'>most sweetness that ever he felt, and he was fulfilled with all thing</a>
<a id='line_26245'>that he thought on or desired. Then he said: Fair sweet Father, Jesu</a>
<a id='line_26246'>Christ, I wot not in what joy I am, for this joy passeth all earthly</a>
<a id='line_26247'>joys that ever I was in. And so in this joy he laid him down to the</a>
<a id='line_26248'>ship’s board, and slept till day. And when he awoke he found there a</a>
<a id='line_26249'>fair bed, and therein lying a gentlewoman dead, the which was Sir</a>
<a id='line_26250'>Percivale’s sister. And as Launcelot devised her, he espied in her</a>
<a id='line_26251'>right hand a writ, the which he read, the which told him all the</a>
<a id='line_26252'>adventures that ye have heard to-fore, and of what lineage she was</a>
<a id='line_26253'>come. So with this gentlewoman Sir Launcelot was a month and more. If</a>
<a id='line_26254'>ye would ask how he lived, He that fed the people of Israel with manna</a>
<a id='line_26255'>in the desert, so was he fed; for every day when he had said his</a>
<a id='line_26256'>prayers he was sustained with the grace of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_26257'></a>
<a id='line_26258'>So on a night he went to play him by the water side, for he was</a>
<a id='line_26259'>somewhat weary of the ship. And then he listened and heard an horse</a>
<a id='line_26260'>come, and one riding upon him. And when he came nigh he seemed a</a>
<a id='line_26261'>knight. And so he let him pass, and went thereas the ship was; and</a>
<a id='line_26262'>there he alighted, and took the saddle and the bridle and put the horse</a>
<a id='line_26263'>from him, and went into the ship. And then Launcelot dressed unto him,</a>
<a id='line_26264'>and said: Ye be welcome. And he answered and saluted him again, and</a>
<a id='line_26265'>asked him: What is your name? for much my heart giveth unto you. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_26266'>said he, my name is Launcelot du Lake. Sir, said he, then be ye</a>
<a id='line_26267'>welcome, for ye were the beginner of me in this world. Ah, said he, are</a>
<a id='line_26268'>ye Galahad? Yea, forsooth, said he; and so he kneeled down and asked</a>
<a id='line_26269'>him his blessing, and after took off his helm and kissed him. And there</a>
<a id='line_26270'>was great joy between them, for there is no tongue can tell the joy</a>
<a id='line_26271'>that they made either of other, and many a friendly word spoken</a>
<a id='line_26272'>between, as kin would, the which is no need here to be rehearsed. And</a>
<a id='line_26273'>there everych told other of their adventures and marvels that were</a>
<a id='line_26274'>befallen to them in many journeys sith that they departed from the</a>
<a id='line_26275'>court.</a>
<a id='line_26276'></a>
<a id='line_26277'>Anon, as Galahad saw the gentlewoman dead in the bed, he knew her well</a>
<a id='line_26278'>enough, and told great worship of her, that she was the best maid</a>
<a id='line_26279'>living, and it was great pity of her death. But when Launcelot heard</a>
<a id='line_26280'>how the marvellous sword was gotten, and who made it, and all the</a>
<a id='line_26281'>marvels rehearsed afore, then he prayed Galahad, his son, that he would</a>
<a id='line_26282'>show him the sword, and so he did; and anon he kissed the pommel, and</a>
<a id='line_26283'>the hilt, and the scabbard. Truly, said Launcelot, never erst knew I of</a>
<a id='line_26284'>so high adventures done, and so marvellous and strange. So dwelt</a>
<a id='line_26285'>Launcelot and Galahad within that ship half a year, and served God</a>
<a id='line_26286'>daily and nightly with all their power; and often they arrived in isles</a>
<a id='line_26287'>far from folk, where there repaired none but wild beasts, and there</a>
<a id='line_26288'>they found many strange adventures and perilous, which they brought to</a>
<a id='line_26289'>an end; but for those adventures were with wild beasts, and not in the</a>
<a id='line_26290'>quest of the Sangreal, therefore the tale maketh here no mention</a>
<a id='line_26291'>thereof, for it would be too long to tell of all those adventures that</a>
<a id='line_26292'>befell them.</a>
<a id='line_26293'></a>
<a id='line_26294'></a>
<a id='line_26295'></a>
<a id='line_26296'></a>
<a id='line_26297'>CHAPTER XIV. How a knight brought unto Sir Galahad a horse, and bade</a>
<a id='line_26298'>him come from his father, Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_26299'></a>
<a id='line_26300'></a>
<a id='line_26301'>So after, on a Monday, it befell that they arrived in the edge of a</a>
<a id='line_26302'>forest to-fore a cross; and then saw they a knight armed all in white,</a>
<a id='line_26303'>and was richly horsed, and led in his right hand a white horse; and so</a>
<a id='line_26304'>he came to the ship, and saluted the two knights on the High Lord’s</a>
<a id='line_26305'>behalf, and said: Galahad, sir, ye have been long enough with your</a>
<a id='line_26306'>father, come out of the ship, and start upon this horse, and go where</a>
<a id='line_26307'>the adventures shall lead thee in the quest of the Sangreal. Then he</a>
<a id='line_26308'>went to his father and kissed him sweetly, and said: Fair sweet father,</a>
<a id='line_26309'>I wot not when I shall see you more till I see the body of Jesu Christ.</a>
<a id='line_26310'>I pray you, said Launcelot, pray ye to the High Father that He hold me</a>
<a id='line_26311'>in His service. And so he took his horse, and there they heard a voice</a>
<a id='line_26312'>that said: Think for to do well, for the one shall never see the other</a>
<a id='line_26313'>before the dreadful day of doom. Now, son Galahad, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_26314'>since we shall depart, and never see other, I pray to the High Father</a>
<a id='line_26315'>to conserve me and you both. Sir, said Galahad, no prayer availeth so</a>
<a id='line_26316'>much as yours. And therewith Galahad entered into the forest.</a>
<a id='line_26317'></a>
<a id='line_26318'>And the wind arose, and drove Launcelot more than a month throughout</a>
<a id='line_26319'>the sea, where he slept but little, but prayed to God that he might see</a>
<a id='line_26320'>some tidings of the Sangreal. So it befell on a night, at midnight, he</a>
<a id='line_26321'>arrived afore a castle, on the back side, which was rich and fair, and</a>
<a id='line_26322'>there was a postern opened toward the sea, and was open without any</a>
<a id='line_26323'>keeping, save two lions kept the entry; and the moon shone clear. Anon</a>
<a id='line_26324'>Sir Launcelot heard a voice that said: Launcelot, go out of this ship</a>
<a id='line_26325'>and enter into the castle, where thou shalt see a great part of thy</a>
<a id='line_26326'>desire. Then he ran to his arms, and so armed him, and so went to the</a>
<a id='line_26327'>gate and saw the lions. Then set he hand to his sword and drew it. Then</a>
<a id='line_26328'>there came a dwarf suddenly, and smote him on the arm so sore that the</a>
<a id='line_26329'>sword fell out of his hand. Then heard he a voice say: O man of evil</a>
<a id='line_26330'>faith and poor belief, wherefore trowest thou more on thy harness than</a>
<a id='line_26331'>in thy Maker, for He might more avail thee than thine armour, in whose</a>
<a id='line_26332'>service that thou art set. Then said Launcelot: Fair Father Jesu</a>
<a id='line_26333'>Christ, I thank thee of Thy great mercy that Thou reprovest me of my</a>
<a id='line_26334'>misdeed; now see I well that ye hold me for your servant. Then took he</a>
<a id='line_26335'>again his sword and put it up in his sheath, and made a cross in his</a>
<a id='line_26336'>forehead, and came to the lions, and they made semblaunt to do him</a>
<a id='line_26337'>harm. Notwithstanding he passed by them without hurt, and entered into</a>
<a id='line_26338'>the castle to the chief fortress, and there were they all at rest. Then</a>
<a id='line_26339'>Launcelot entered in so armed, for he found no gate nor door but it was</a>
<a id='line_26340'>open. And at the last he found a chamber whereof the door was shut, and</a>
<a id='line_26341'>he set his hand thereto to have opened it, but he might not.</a>
<a id='line_26342'></a>
<a id='line_26343'></a>
<a id='line_26344'></a>
<a id='line_26345'></a>
<a id='line_26346'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot was to-fore the door of the chamber</a>
<a id='line_26347'>wherein the Holy Sangreal was.</a>
<a id='line_26348'></a>
<a id='line_26349'></a>
<a id='line_26350'>Then he enforced him mickle to undo the door. Then he listened and</a>
<a id='line_26351'>heard a voice which sang so sweetly that it seemed none earthly thing;</a>
<a id='line_26352'>and him thought the voice said: Joy and honour be to the Father of</a>
<a id='line_26353'>Heaven. Then Launcelot kneeled down to-fore the chamber, for well wist</a>
<a id='line_26354'>he that there was the Sangreal within that chamber. Then said he: Fair</a>
<a id='line_26355'>sweet Father, Jesu Christ, if ever I did thing that pleased Thee, Lord</a>
<a id='line_26356'>for Thy pity never have me not in despite for my sins done aforetime,</a>
<a id='line_26357'>and that Thou show me something of that I seek. And with that he saw</a>
<a id='line_26358'>the chamber door open, and there came out a great clearness, that the</a>
<a id='line_26359'>house was as bright as all the torches of the world had been there.</a>
<a id='line_26360'></a>
<a id='line_26361'>So came he to the chamber door, and would have entered. And anon a</a>
<a id='line_26362'>voice said to him: Flee, Launcelot, and enter not, for thou oughtest</a>
<a id='line_26363'>not to do it; and if thou enter thou shalt for-think it. Then he</a>
<a id='line_26364'>withdrew him aback right heavy. Then looked he up in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_26365'>chamber, and saw a table of silver, and the Holy Vessel, covered with</a>
<a id='line_26366'>red samite, and many angels about it, whereof one held a candle of wax</a>
<a id='line_26367'>burning, and the other held a cross, and the ornaments of an altar. And</a>
<a id='line_26368'>before the Holy Vessel he saw a good man clothed as a priest. And it</a>
<a id='line_26369'>seemed that he was at the sacring of the mass. And it seemed to</a>
<a id='line_26370'>Launcelot that above the priest’s hands were three men, whereof the two</a>
<a id='line_26371'>put the youngest by likeness between the priest’s hands; and so he lift</a>
<a id='line_26372'>it up right high, and it seemed to show so to the people. And then</a>
<a id='line_26373'>Launcelot marvelled not a little, for him thought the priest was so</a>
<a id='line_26374'>greatly charged of the figure that him seemed that he should fall to</a>
<a id='line_26375'>the earth. And when he saw none about him that would help him, then</a>
<a id='line_26376'>came he to the door a great pace, and said: Fair Father Jesu Christ, ne</a>
<a id='line_26377'>take it for no sin though I help the good man which hath great need of</a>
<a id='line_26378'>help.</a>
<a id='line_26379'></a>
<a id='line_26380'>Right so entered he into the chamber, and came toward the table of</a>
<a id='line_26381'>silver; and when he came nigh he felt a breath, that him thought it was</a>
<a id='line_26382'>intermeddled with fire, which smote him so sore in the visage that him</a>
<a id='line_26383'>thought it brent his visage; and therewith he fell to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_26384'>had no power to arise, as he that was so araged, that had lost the</a>
<a id='line_26385'>power of his body, and his hearing, and his seeing. Then felt he many</a>
<a id='line_26386'>hands about him, which took him up and bare him out of the chamber</a>
<a id='line_26387'>door, without any amending of his swoon, and left him there, seeming</a>
<a id='line_26388'>dead to all people.</a>
<a id='line_26389'></a>
<a id='line_26390'>So upon the morrow when it was fair day they within were arisen, and</a>
<a id='line_26391'>found Launcelot lying afore the chamber door. All they marvelled how</a>
<a id='line_26392'>that he came in, and so they looked upon him, and felt his pulse to wit</a>
<a id='line_26393'>whether there were any life in him; and so they found life in him, but</a>
<a id='line_26394'>he might not stand nor stir no member that he had. And so they took him</a>
<a id='line_26395'>by every part of the body, and bare him into a chamber, and laid him in</a>
<a id='line_26396'>a rich bed, far from all folk; and so he lay four days. Then the one</a>
<a id='line_26397'>said he was alive, and the other said, Nay. In the name of God, said an</a>
<a id='line_26398'>old man, for I do you verily to wit he is not dead, but he is so full</a>
<a id='line_26399'>of life as the mightiest of you all; and therefore I counsel you that</a>
<a id='line_26400'>he be well kept till God send him life again.</a>
<a id='line_26401'></a>

<a id='line_26405'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir launcelot had lain four-and-twenty days and as</a>
<a id='line_26406'>many nights as a dead man, and other divers matters.</a>
<a id='line_26407'></a>
<a id='line_26408'></a>
<a id='line_26409'>In such manner they kept Launcelot four-and-twenty days and all so many</a>
<a id='line_26410'>nights, that ever he lay still as a dead man; and at the twenty-fifth</a>
<a id='line_26411'>day befell him after midday that he opened his eyes. And when he saw</a>
<a id='line_26412'>folk he made great sorrow, and said: Why have ye awaked me, for I was</a>
<a id='line_26413'>more at ease than I am now. O Jesu Christ, who might be so blessed that</a>
<a id='line_26414'>might see openly thy great marvels of secretness there where no sinner</a>
<a id='line_26415'>may be! What have ye seen? said they about him. I have seen, said he,</a>
<a id='line_26416'>so great marvels that no tongue may tell, and more than any heart can</a>
<a id='line_26417'>think, and had not my son been here afore me I had seen much more.</a>
<a id='line_26418'></a>
<a id='line_26419'>Then they told him how he had lain there four-and-twenty days and</a>
<a id='line_26420'>nights. Then him thought it was punishment for the four-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_26421'>years that he had been a sinner, wherefore Our Lord put him in penance</a>
<a id='line_26422'>four-and-twenty days and nights. Then looked Sir Launcelot afore him,</a>
<a id='line_26423'>and saw the hair which he had borne nigh a year, for that he</a>
<a id='line_26424'>for-thought him right much that he had broken his promise unto the</a>
<a id='line_26425'>hermit, which he had avowed to do. Then they asked how it stood with</a>
<a id='line_26426'>him. Forsooth, said he, I am whole of body, thanked be Our Lord;</a>
<a id='line_26427'>therefore, sirs, for God’s love tell me where I am. Then said they all</a>
<a id='line_26428'>that he was in the castle of Carbonek.</a>
<a id='line_26429'></a>
<a id='line_26430'>Therewith came a gentlewoman and brought him a shirt of small linen</a>
<a id='line_26431'>cloth, but he changed not there, but took the hair to him again. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_26432'>said they, the quest of the Sangreal is achieved now right in you, that</a>
<a id='line_26433'>never shall ye see of the Sangreal no more than ye have seen. Now I</a>
<a id='line_26434'>thank God, said Launcelot, of His great mercy of that I have seen, for</a>
<a id='line_26435'>it sufficeth me; for as I suppose no man in this world hath lived</a>
<a id='line_26436'>better than I have done to enchieve that I have done. And therewith he</a>
<a id='line_26437'>took the hair and clothed him in it, and above that he put a linen</a>
<a id='line_26438'>shirt, and after a robe of scarlet, fresh and new. And when he was so</a>
<a id='line_26439'>arrayed they marvelled all, for they knew him that he was Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_26440'>the good knight. And then they said all: O my lord Sir Launcelot, be</a>
<a id='line_26441'>that ye? And he said: Truly I am he.</a>
<a id='line_26442'></a>
<a id='line_26443'>Then came word to King Pelles that the knight that had lain so long</a>
<a id='line_26444'>dead was Sir Launcelot. Then was the king right glad, and went to see</a>
<a id='line_26445'>him. And when Launcelot saw him come he dressed him against him, and</a>
<a id='line_26446'>there made the king great joy of him. And there the king told him</a>
<a id='line_26447'>tidings that his fair daughter was dead. Then Launcelot was right heavy</a>
<a id='line_26448'>of it, and said: Sir, me forthinketh the death of your daughter, for</a>
<a id='line_26449'>she was a full fair lady, fresh and young. And well I wot she bare the</a>
<a id='line_26450'>best knight that is now on the earth, or that ever was sith God was</a>
<a id='line_26451'>born. So the king held him there four days, and on the morrow he took</a>
<a id='line_26452'>his leave at King Pelles and at all the fellowship, and thanked them of</a>
<a id='line_26453'>their great labour.</a>
<a id='line_26454'></a>
<a id='line_26455'>Right so as they sat at their dinner in the chief salle, then was so</a>
<a id='line_26456'>befallen that the Sangreal had fulfilled the table with all manner of</a>
<a id='line_26457'>meats that any heart might think. So as they sat they saw all the doors</a>
<a id='line_26458'>and the windows of the place were shut without man’s hand, whereof they</a>
<a id='line_26459'>were all abashed, and none wist what to do.</a>
<a id='line_26460'></a>
<a id='line_26461'>And then it happed suddenly a knight came to the chief door and</a>
<a id='line_26462'>knocked, and cried: Undo the door. But they would not. And ever he</a>
<a id='line_26463'>cried: Undo; but they would not. And at last it noyed them so much that</a>
<a id='line_26464'>the king himself arose and came to a window there where the knight</a>
<a id='line_26465'>called. Then he said: Sir knight, ye shall not enter at this time while</a>
<a id='line_26466'>the Sangreal is here, and therefore go into another; for certes ye be</a>
<a id='line_26467'>none of the knights of the quest, but one of them which hath served the</a>
<a id='line_26468'>fiend, and hast left the service of Our Lord: and he was passing wroth</a>
<a id='line_26469'>at the king’s words. Sir knight, said the king, sith ye would so fain</a>
<a id='line_26470'>enter, say me of what country ye be. Sir, said he, I am of the realm of</a>
<a id='line_26471'>Logris, and my name is Ector de Maris, and brother unto my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_26472'>Launcelot. In the name of God, said the king, me for-thinketh of what I</a>
<a id='line_26473'>have said, for your brother is here within. And when Ector de Maris</a>
<a id='line_26474'>understood that his brother was there, for he was the man in the world</a>
<a id='line_26475'>that he most dread and loved, and then he said: Ah God, now doubleth my</a>
<a id='line_26476'>sorrow and shame. Full truly said the good man of the hill unto Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_26477'>and to me of our dreams. Then went he out of the court as fast as his</a>
<a id='line_26478'>horse might, and so throughout the castle.</a>

<a id='line_26484'>adventures which he saw in the way.</a>
<a id='line_26485'></a>
<a id='line_26486'></a>
<a id='line_26487'>Then King Pelles came to Sir Launcelot and told him tidings of his</a>
<a id='line_26488'>brother, whereof he was sorry, that he wist not what to do. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_26489'>Launcelot departed, and took his arms, and said he would go see the</a>
<a id='line_26490'>realm of Logris, which I have not seen in twelve months. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_26491'>he commended the king to God, and so rode through many realms. And at</a>
<a id='line_26492'>the last he came to a white abbey, and there they made him that night</a>
<a id='line_26493'>great cheer; and on the morn he rose and heard mass. And afore an altar</a>
<a id='line_26494'>he found a rich tomb, which was newly made; and then he took heed, and</a>
<a id='line_26495'>saw the sides written with gold which said: Here lieth King Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_26496'>of Gore, which King Arthur’s nephew slew; and named him, Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_26497'>Then was not he a little sorry, for Launcelot loved him much more than</a>
<a id='line_26498'>any other, and had it been any other than Gawaine he should not have</a>
<a id='line_26499'>escaped from death to life; and said to himself: Ah Lord God, this is a</a>
<a id='line_26500'>great hurt unto King Arthur’s court, the loss of such a man. And then</a>
<a id='line_26501'>he departed and came to the abbey where Galahad did the adventure of</a>
<a id='line_26502'>the tombs, and won the white shield with the red cross; and there had</a>
<a id='line_26503'>he great cheer all that night.</a>
<a id='line_26504'></a>
<a id='line_26505'>And on the morn he turned unto Camelot, where he found King Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_26506'>the queen. But many of the knights of the Round Table were slain and</a>
<a id='line_26507'>destroyed, more than half. And so three were come home, Ector, Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_26508'>and Lionel, and many other that need not to be rehearsed. And all the</a>
<a id='line_26509'>court was passing glad of Sir Launcelot, and the king asked him many</a>
<a id='line_26510'>tidings of his son Galahad. And there Launcelot told the king of his</a>
<a id='line_26511'>adventures that had befallen him since he departed. And also he told</a>
<a id='line_26512'>him of the adventures of Galahad, Percivale, and Bors, which that he</a>
<a id='line_26513'>knew by the letter of the dead damosel, and as Galahad had told him.</a>
<a id='line_26514'>Now God would, said the king, that they were all three here. That shall</a>
<a id='line_26515'>never be, said Launcelot, for two of them shall ye never see, but one</a>
<a id='line_26516'>of them shall come again.</a>
<a id='line_26517'></a>
<a id='line_26518'>Now leave we this story and speak of Galahad.</a>

<a id='line_26524'>and adventures.</a>
<a id='line_26525'></a>
<a id='line_26526'></a>
<a id='line_26527'>Now, saith the story, Galahad rode many journeys in vain. And at the</a>
<a id='line_26528'>last he came to the abbey where King Mordrains was, and when he heard</a>
<a id='line_26529'>that, he thought he would abide to see him. And upon the morn, when he</a>
<a id='line_26530'>had heard mass, Galahad came unto King Mordrains, and anon the king saw</a>
<a id='line_26531'>him, which had lain blind of long time. And then he dressed him against</a>
<a id='line_26532'>him, and said: Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, whose coming I have</a>
<a id='line_26533'>abiden so long, now embrace me and let me rest on thy breast, so that I</a>
<a id='line_26534'>may rest between thine arms, for thou art a clean virgin above all</a>
<a id='line_26535'>knights, as the flower of the lily in whom virginity is signified, and</a>
<a id='line_26536'>thou art the rose the which is the flower of all good virtues, and in</a>
<a id='line_26537'>colour of fire. For the fire of the Holy Ghost is taken so in thee that</a>
<a id='line_26538'>my flesh which was all dead of oldness is become young again. Then</a>
<a id='line_26539'>Galahad heard his words, then he embraced him and all his body. Then</a>
<a id='line_26540'>said he: Fair Lord Jesu Christ, now I have my will. Now I require thee,</a>
<a id='line_26541'>in this point that I am in, thou come and visit me. And anon Our Lord</a>
<a id='line_26542'>heard his prayer: therewith the soul departed from the body.</a>
<a id='line_26543'></a>
<a id='line_26544'>And then Galahad put him in the earth as a king ought to be, and so</a>
<a id='line_26545'>departed and so came into a perilous forest where he found the well the</a>
<a id='line_26546'>which boileth with great waves, as the tale telleth to-fore. And as</a>
<a id='line_26547'>soon as Galahad set his hand thereto it ceased, so that it brent no</a>
<a id='line_26548'>more, and the heat departed. For that it brent it was a sign of</a>
<a id='line_26549'>lechery, the which was that time much used. But that heat might not</a>
<a id='line_26550'>abide his pure virginity. And this was taken in the country for a</a>
<a id='line_26551'>miracle. And so ever after was it called Galahad’s well.</a>
<a id='line_26552'></a>
<a id='line_26553'>Then by adventure he came into the country of Gore, and into the abbey</a>
<a id='line_26554'>where Launcelot had been to-forehand, and found the tomb of King</a>
<a id='line_26555'>Bagdemagus, but he was founder thereof, Joseph of Aramathie’s son; and</a>
<a id='line_26556'>the tomb of Simeon where Launcelot had failed. Then he looked into a</a>
<a id='line_26557'>croft under the minster, and there he saw a tomb which brent full</a>
<a id='line_26558'>marvellously. Then asked he the brethren what it was. Sir, said they, a</a>
<a id='line_26559'>marvellous adventure that may not be brought unto none end but by him</a>
<a id='line_26560'>that passeth of bounty and of knighthood all them of the Round Table. I</a>
<a id='line_26561'>would, said Galahad, that ye would lead me thereto. Gladly, said they,</a>
<a id='line_26562'>and so led him till a cave. And he went down upon greses, and came nigh</a>
<a id='line_26563'>the tomb. And then the flaming failed, and the fire staunched, the</a>
<a id='line_26564'>which many a day had been great. Then came there a voice that said:</a>
<a id='line_26565'>Much are ye beholden to thank Our Lord, the which hath given you a good</a>
<a id='line_26566'>hour, that ye may draw out the souls of earthly pain, and to put them</a>
<a id='line_26567'>into the joys of paradise. I am of your kindred, the which hath dwelled</a>
<a id='line_26568'>in this heat this three hundred winter and four-and-fifty to be purged</a>
<a id='line_26569'>of the sin that I did against Joseph of Aramathie. Then Galahad took</a>
<a id='line_26570'>the body in his arms and bare it into the minster. And that night lay</a>
<a id='line_26571'>Galahad in the abbey; and on the morn he gave him service, and put him</a>
<a id='line_26572'>in the earth afore the high altar.</a>
<a id='line_26573'></a>

<a id='line_26577'>CHAPTER XIX. How Sir Percivale and Sir Bors met with Sir Galahad, and</a>
<a id='line_26578'>how they came to the castle of Carbonek, and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_26579'></a>
<a id='line_26580'></a>
<a id='line_26581'>So departed he from thence, and commended the brethren to God; and so</a>
<a id='line_26582'>he rode five days till that he came to the Maimed King. And ever</a>
<a id='line_26583'>followed Percivale the five days, asking where he had been; and so one</a>
<a id='line_26584'>told him how the adventures of Logris were enchieved. So on a day it</a>
<a id='line_26585'>befell that they came out of a great forest, and there they met at</a>
<a id='line_26586'>traverse with Sir Bors, the which rode alone. It is none need to tell</a>
<a id='line_26587'>if they were glad; and them he saluted, and they yielded him honour and</a>
<a id='line_26588'>good adventure, and everych told other. Then said Bors: It is mo than a</a>
<a id='line_26589'>year and an half that I ne lay ten times where men dwelled, but in wild</a>
<a id='line_26590'>forests and in mountains, but God was ever my comfort.</a>
<a id='line_26591'></a>
<a id='line_26592'>Then rode they a great while till that they came to the castle of</a>
<a id='line_26593'>Carbonek. And when they were entered within the castle King Pelles knew</a>
<a id='line_26594'>them; then there was great joy, for they wist well by their coming that</a>
<a id='line_26595'>they had fulfilled the quest of the Sangreal. Then Eliazar, King</a>
<a id='line_26596'>Pelles’ son, brought to-fore them the broken sword wherewith Joseph was</a>
<a id='line_26597'>stricken through the thigh. Then Bors set his hand thereto, if that he</a>
<a id='line_26598'>might have soldered it again; but it would not be. Then he took it to</a>
<a id='line_26599'>Percivale, but he had no more power thereto than he. Now have ye it</a>
<a id='line_26600'>again, said Percivale to Galahad, for an it be ever enchieved by any</a>
<a id='line_26601'>bodily man ye must do it. And then he took the pieces and set them</a>
<a id='line_26602'>together, and they seemed that they had never been broken, and as well</a>
<a id='line_26603'>as it had been first forged. And when they within espied that the</a>
<a id='line_26604'>adventure of the sword was enchieved, then they gave the sword to Bors,</a>
<a id='line_26605'>for it might not be better set; for he was a good knight and a worthy</a>
<a id='line_26606'>man.</a>
<a id='line_26607'></a>
<a id='line_26608'>And a little afore even the sword arose great and marvellous, and was</a>
<a id='line_26609'>full of great heat that many men fell for dread. And anon alighted a</a>
<a id='line_26610'>voice among them, and said: They that ought not to sit at the table of</a>
<a id='line_26611'>Jesu Christ arise, for now shall very knights be fed. So they went</a>
<a id='line_26612'>thence, all save King Pelles and Eliazar, his son, the which were holy</a>
<a id='line_26613'>men, and a maid which was his niece; and so these three fellows and</a>
<a id='line_26614'>they three were there, no mo. Anon they saw knights all armed came in</a>
<a id='line_26615'>at the hall door, and did off their helms and their arms, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_26616'>Galahad: Sir, we have hied right much for to be with you at this table</a>
<a id='line_26617'>where the holy meat shall be departed. Then said he: Ye be welcome, but</a>
<a id='line_26618'>of whence be ye? So three of them said they were of Gaul, and other</a>
<a id='line_26619'>three said they were of Ireland, and the other three said they were of</a>
<a id='line_26620'>Denmark. So as they sat thus there came out a bed of tree, of a</a>
<a id='line_26621'>chamber, the which four gentlewomen brought; and in the bed lay a good</a>
<a id='line_26622'>man sick, and a crown of gold upon his head; and there in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_26623'>the place they set him down, and went again their way. Then he lift up</a>
<a id='line_26624'>his head, and said: Galahad, Knight, ye be welcome, for much have I</a>
<a id='line_26625'>desired your coming, for in such pain and in such anguish I have been</a>
<a id='line_26626'>long. But now I trust to God the term is come that my pain shall be</a>
<a id='line_26627'>allayed, that I shall pass out of this world so as it was promised me</a>
<a id='line_26628'>long ago. Therewith a voice said: There be two among you that be not in</a>
<a id='line_26629'>the quest of the Sangreal, and therefore depart ye.</a>
<a id='line_26630'></a>

<a id='line_26634'>CHAPTER XX. How Galahad and his fellows were fed of the Holy Sangreal,</a>
<a id='line_26635'>and how Our Lord appeared to them, and other things.</a>
<a id='line_26636'></a>
<a id='line_26637'></a>
<a id='line_26638'>Then King Pelles and his son departed. And therewithal beseemed them</a>
<a id='line_26639'>that there came a man, and four angels from heaven, clothed in likeness</a>
<a id='line_26640'>of a bishop, and had a cross in his hand; and these four angels bare</a>
<a id='line_26641'>him up in a chair, and set him down before the table of silver where</a>
<a id='line_26642'>upon the Sangreal was; and it seemed that he had in midst of his</a>
<a id='line_26643'>forehead letters the which said: See ye here Joseph, the first bishop</a>
<a id='line_26644'>of Christendom, the same which Our Lord succoured in the city of Sarras</a>
<a id='line_26645'>in the spiritual place. Then the knights marvelled, for that bishop was</a>
<a id='line_26646'>dead more than three hundred year to-fore. O knights, said he, marvel</a>
<a id='line_26647'>not, for I was sometime an earthly man. With that they heard the</a>
<a id='line_26648'>chamber door open, and there they saw angels; and two bare candles of</a>
<a id='line_26649'>wax, and the third a towel, and the fourth a spear which bled</a>
<a id='line_26650'>marvellously, that three drops fell within a box which he held with his</a>
<a id='line_26651'>other hand. And they set the candles upon the table, and the third the</a>
<a id='line_26652'>towel upon the vessel, and the fourth the holy spear even upright upon</a>
<a id='line_26653'>the vessel. And then the bishop made semblaunt as though he would have</a>
<a id='line_26654'>gone to the sacring of the mass. And then he took an ubblie which was</a>
<a id='line_26655'>made in likeness of bread. And at the lifting up there came a figure in</a>
<a id='line_26656'>likeness of a child, and the visage was as red and as bright as any</a>
<a id='line_26657'>fire, and smote himself into the bread, so that they all saw it that</a>
<a id='line_26658'>the bread was formed of a fleshly man; and then he put it into the Holy</a>
<a id='line_26659'>Vessel again, and then he did that longed to a priest to do to a mass.</a>
<a id='line_26660'>And then he went to Galahad and kissed him, and bade him go and kiss</a>
<a id='line_26661'>his fellows: and so he did anon. Now, said he, servants of Jesu Christ,</a>
<a id='line_26662'>ye shall be fed afore this table with sweet meats that never knights</a>
<a id='line_26663'>tasted. And when he had said, he vanished away. And they set them at</a>
<a id='line_26664'>the table in great dread, and made their prayers.</a>
<a id='line_26665'></a>
<a id='line_26666'>Then looked they and saw a man come out of the Holy Vessel, that had</a>
<a id='line_26667'>all the signs of the passion of Jesu Christ, bleeding all openly, and</a>
<a id='line_26668'>said: My knights, and my servants, and my true children, which be come</a>
<a id='line_26669'>out of deadly life into spiritual life, I will now no longer hide me</a>
<a id='line_26670'>from you, but ye shall see now a part of my secrets and of my hidden</a>
<a id='line_26671'>things: now hold and receive the high meat which ye have so much</a>
<a id='line_26672'>desired. Then took he himself the Holy Vessel and came to Galahad; and</a>
<a id='line_26673'>he kneeled down, and there he received his Saviour, and after him so</a>
<a id='line_26674'>received all his fellows; and they thought it so sweet that it was</a>
<a id='line_26675'>marvellous to tell. Then said he to Galahad: Son, wottest thou what I</a>
<a id='line_26676'>hold betwixt my hands? Nay, said he, but if ye will tell me. This is,</a>
<a id='line_26677'>said he, the holy dish wherein I ate the lamb on Sheer-Thursday. And</a>
<a id='line_26678'>now hast thou seen that thou most desired to see, but yet hast thou not</a>
<a id='line_26679'>seen it so openly as thou shalt see it in the city of Sarras in the</a>
<a id='line_26680'>spiritual place. Therefore thou must go hence and bear with thee this</a>
<a id='line_26681'>Holy Vessel; for this night it shall depart from the realm of Logris,</a>
<a id='line_26682'>that it shall never be seen more here. And wottest thou wherefore? For</a>
<a id='line_26683'>he is not served nor worshipped to his right by them of this land, for</a>
<a id='line_26684'>they be turned to evil living; therefore I shall disherit them of the</a>
<a id='line_26685'>honour which I have done them. And therefore go ye three to-morrow unto</a>
<a id='line_26686'>the sea, where ye shall find your ship ready, and with you take the</a>
<a id='line_26687'>sword with the strange girdles, and no more with you but Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_26688'>and Sir Bors. Also I will that ye take with you of the blood of this</a>
<a id='line_26689'>spear for to anoint the Maimed King, both his legs and all his body,</a>
<a id='line_26690'>and he shall have his health. Sir, said Galahad, why shall not these</a>
<a id='line_26691'>other fellows go with us? For this cause: for right as I departed my</a>
<a id='line_26692'>apostles one here and another there, so I will that ye depart; and two</a>
<a id='line_26693'>of you shall die in my service, but one of you shall come again and</a>
<a id='line_26694'>tell tidings. Then gave he them his blessing and vanished away.</a>
<a id='line_26695'></a>
<a id='line_26696'></a>

<a id='line_26698'></a>
<a id='line_26699'>CHAPTER XXI. How Galahad anointed with the blood of the spear the</a>
<a id='line_26700'>Maimed King, and of other adventures.</a>
<a id='line_26701'></a>
<a id='line_26702'></a>
<a id='line_26703'>And Galahad went anon to the spear which lay upon the table, and</a>
<a id='line_26704'>touched the blood with his fingers, and came after to the Maimed King</a>
<a id='line_26705'>and anointed his legs.</a>
<a id='line_26706'></a>
<a id='line_26707'>And therewith he clothed him anon, and start upon his feet out of his</a>
<a id='line_26708'>bed as an whole man, and thanked Our Lord that He had healed him. And</a>
<a id='line_26709'>that was not to the worldward, for anon he yielded him to a place of</a>
<a id='line_26710'>religion of white monks, and was a full holy man.</a>
<a id='line_26711'></a>
<a id='line_26712'>That same night about midnight came a voice among them which said: My</a>
<a id='line_26713'>sons and not my chief sons, my friends and not my warriors, go ye hence</a>
<a id='line_26714'>where ye hope best to do and as I bade you.</a>
<a id='line_26715'></a>
<a id='line_26716'>Ah, thanked be Thou, Lord, that Thou wilt vouchsafe to call us, Thy</a>
<a id='line_26717'>sinners. Now may we well prove that we have not lost our pains.</a>
<a id='line_26718'></a>
<a id='line_26719'>And anon in all haste they took their harness and departed.</a>
<a id='line_26720'></a>
<a id='line_26721'>But the three knights of Gaul, one of them hight Claudine, King</a>
<a id='line_26722'>Claudas’ son, and the other two were great gentlemen. Then prayed</a>
<a id='line_26723'>Galahad to everych of them, that if they come to King Arthur’s court</a>
<a id='line_26724'>that they should salute my lord, Sir Launcelot, my father, and all them</a>
<a id='line_26725'>of the Round Table; and prayed them if that they came on that part that</a>
<a id='line_26726'>they should not forget it.</a>
<a id='line_26727'></a>
<a id='line_26728'>Right so departed Galahad, Percivale and Bors with him; and so they</a>
<a id='line_26729'>rode three days, and then they came to a rivage, and found the ship</a>
<a id='line_26730'>whereof the tale speaketh of to-fore. And when they came to the board</a>
<a id='line_26731'>they found in the midst the table of silver which they had left with</a>
<a id='line_26732'>the Maimed King, and the Sangreal which was covered with red samite.</a>
<a id='line_26733'></a>
<a id='line_26734'>Then were they glad to have such things in their fellowship; and so</a>
<a id='line_26735'>they entered and made great reverence thereto; and Galahad fell in his</a>
<a id='line_26736'>prayer long time to Our Lord, that at what time he asked, that he</a>
<a id='line_26737'>should pass out of this world.</a>
<a id='line_26738'></a>
<a id='line_26739'>So much he prayed till a voice said to him: Galahad, thou shalt have</a>
<a id='line_26740'>thy request; and when thou askest the death of thy body thou shalt have</a>
<a id='line_26741'>it, and then shalt thou find the life of the soul.</a>
<a id='line_26742'></a>
<a id='line_26743'>Percivale heard this, and prayed him, of fellowship that was between</a>
<a id='line_26744'>them, to tell him wherefore he asked such things.</a>
<a id='line_26745'></a>
<a id='line_26746'>That shall I tell you, said Galahad; the other day when we saw a part</a>
<a id='line_26747'>of the adventures of the Sangreal I was in such a joy of heart, that I</a>
<a id='line_26748'>trow never man was that was earthly. And therefore I wot well, when my</a>
<a id='line_26749'>body is dead my soul shall be in great joy to see the blessed Trinity</a>
<a id='line_26750'>every day, and the majesty of Our Lord, Jesu Christ.</a>
<a id='line_26751'></a>
<a id='line_26752'>So long were they in the ship that they said to Galahad: Sir, in this</a>
<a id='line_26753'>bed ought ye to lie, for so saith the scripture. And so he laid him</a>
<a id='line_26754'>down and slept a great while; and when he awaked he looked afore him</a>
<a id='line_26755'>and saw the city of Sarras. And as they would have landed they saw the</a>
<a id='line_26756'>ship wherein Percivale had put his sister in. Truly, said Percivale, in</a>
<a id='line_26757'>the name of God, well hath my sister holden us covenant. Then took they</a>
<a id='line_26758'>out of the ship the table of silver, and he took it to Percivale and to</a>
<a id='line_26759'>Bors, to go to-fore, and Galahad came behind. And right so they went to</a>
<a id='line_26760'>the city, and at the gate of the city they saw an old man crooked. Then</a>
<a id='line_26761'>Galahad called him and bade him help to bear this heavy thing. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_26762'>said the old man, it is ten year ago that I might not go but with</a>
<a id='line_26763'>crutches. Care thou not, said Galahad, and arise up and shew thy good</a>
<a id='line_26764'>will. And so he assayed, and found himself as whole as ever he was.</a>
<a id='line_26765'>Than ran he to the table, and took one part against Galahad. And anon</a>
<a id='line_26766'>arose there great noise in the city, that a cripple was made whole by</a>
<a id='line_26767'>knights marvellous that entered into the city.</a>
<a id='line_26768'></a>
<a id='line_26769'>Then anon after, the three knights went to the water, and brought up</a>
<a id='line_26770'>into the palace Percivale’s sister, and buried her as richly as a</a>
<a id='line_26771'>king’s daughter ought to be. And when the king of the city, which was</a>
<a id='line_26772'>cleped Estorause, saw the fellowship, he asked them of whence they</a>
<a id='line_26773'>were, and what thing it was that they had brought upon the table of</a>
<a id='line_26774'>silver. And they told him the truth of the Sangreal, and the power</a>
<a id='line_26775'>which that God had sent there. Then the king was a tyrant, and was come</a>
<a id='line_26776'>of the line of paynims, and took them and put them in prison in a deep</a>
<a id='line_26777'>hole.</a>
<a id='line_26778'></a>
<a id='line_26779'></a>

<a id='line_26781'></a>
<a id='line_26782'>CHAPTER XXII. How they were fed with the Sangreal while they were in</a>
<a id='line_26783'>prison, and how Galahad was made king.</a>
<a id='line_26784'></a>
<a id='line_26785'></a>
<a id='line_26786'>But as soon as they were there Our Lord sent them the Sangreal, through</a>
<a id='line_26787'>whose grace they were always fulfilled while that they were in prison.</a>
<a id='line_26788'></a>
<a id='line_26789'>So at the year’s end it befell that this King Estorause lay sick, and</a>
<a id='line_26790'>felt that he should die. Then he sent for the three knights, and they</a>
<a id='line_26791'>came afore him; and he cried them mercy of that he had done to them,</a>
<a id='line_26792'>and they forgave it him goodly; and he died anon. When the king was</a>
<a id='line_26793'>dead all the city was dismayed, and wist not who might be their king.</a>
<a id='line_26794'>Right so as they were in counsel there came a voice among them, and</a>
<a id='line_26795'>bade them choose the youngest knight of them three to be their king:</a>
<a id='line_26796'>For he shall well maintain you and all yours. So they made Galahad king</a>
<a id='line_26797'>by all the assent of the holy city, and else they would have slain him.</a>
<a id='line_26798'>And when he was come to behold the land, he let make above the table of</a>
<a id='line_26799'>silver a chest of gold and of precious stones, that hilled the Holy</a>
<a id='line_26800'>Vessel. And every day early the three fellows would come afore it, and</a>
<a id='line_26801'>make their prayers.</a>
<a id='line_26802'></a>
<a id='line_26803'>Now at the year’s end, and the self day after Galahad had borne the</a>
<a id='line_26804'>crown of gold, he arose up early and his fellows, and came to the</a>
<a id='line_26805'>palace, and saw to-fore them the Holy Vessel, and a man kneeling on his</a>
<a id='line_26806'>knees in likeness of a bishop, that had about him a great fellowship of</a>
<a id='line_26807'>angels, as it had been Jesu Christ himself; and then he arose and began</a>
<a id='line_26808'>a mass of Our Lady. And when he came to the sacrament of the mass, and</a>
<a id='line_26809'>had done, anon he called Galahad, and said to him: Come forth the</a>
<a id='line_26810'>servant of Jesu Christ, and thou shalt see that thou hast much desired</a>
<a id='line_26811'>to see. And then he began to tremble right hard when the deadly flesh</a>
<a id='line_26812'>began to behold the spiritual things. Then he held up his hands toward</a>
<a id='line_26813'>heaven and said: Lord, I thank thee, for now I see that that hath been</a>
<a id='line_26814'>my desire many a day. Now, blessed Lord, would I not longer live, if it</a>
<a id='line_26815'>might please thee, Lord. And therewith the good man took Our Lord’s</a>
<a id='line_26816'>body betwixt his hands, and proffered it to Galahad, and he received it</a>
<a id='line_26817'>right gladly and meekly. Now wottest thou what I am? said the good man.</a>
<a id='line_26818'>Nay, said Galahad. I am Joseph of Aramathie, the which Our Lord hath</a>
<a id='line_26819'>sent here to thee to bear thee fellowship; and wottest thou wherefore</a>
<a id='line_26820'>that he hath sent me more than any other? For thou hast resembled me in</a>
<a id='line_26821'>two things; in that thou hast seen the marvels of the Sangreal, in that</a>
<a id='line_26822'>thou hast been a clean maiden, as I have been and am.</a>
<a id='line_26823'></a>
<a id='line_26824'>And when he had said these words Galahad went to Percivale and kissed</a>
<a id='line_26825'>him, and commended him to God; and so he went to Sir Bors and kissed</a>
<a id='line_26826'>him, and commended him to God, and said: Fair lord, salute me to my</a>
<a id='line_26827'>lord, Sir Launcelot, my father, and as soon as ye see him, bid him</a>
<a id='line_26828'>remember of this unstable world. And therewith he kneeled down to-fore</a>
<a id='line_26829'>the table and made his prayers, and then suddenly his soul departed to</a>
<a id='line_26830'>Jesu Christ, and a great multitude of angels bare his soul up to</a>
<a id='line_26831'>heaven, that the two fellows might well behold it. Also the two fellows</a>
<a id='line_26832'>saw come from heaven an hand, but they saw not the body. And then it</a>
<a id='line_26833'>came right to the Vessel, and took it and the spear, and so bare it up</a>
<a id='line_26834'>to heaven. Sithen was there never man so hardy to say that he had seen</a>
<a id='line_26835'>the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_26836'></a>
<a id='line_26837'></a>
<a id='line_26838'></a>
<a id='line_26839'></a>
<a id='line_26840'>CHAPTER XXIII. Of the sorrow that Percivale and Bors made when Galahad</a>
<a id='line_26841'>was dead: and of Percivale how he died, and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_26842'></a>
<a id='line_26843'></a>
<a id='line_26844'>When Percivale and Bors saw Galahad dead they made as much sorrow as</a>
<a id='line_26845'>ever did two men. And if they had not been good men they might lightly</a>
<a id='line_26846'>have fallen in despair. And the people of the country and of the city</a>
<a id='line_26847'>were right heavy. And then he was buried; and as soon as he was buried</a>
<a id='line_26848'>Sir Percivale yielded him to an hermitage out of the city, and took a</a>
<a id='line_26849'>religious clothing. And Bors was alway with him, but never changed he</a>
<a id='line_26850'>his secular clothing, for that he purposed him to go again into the</a>
<a id='line_26851'>realm of Logris. Thus a year and two months lived Sir Percivale in the</a>
<a id='line_26852'>hermitage a full holy life, and then passed out of this world; and Bors</a>
<a id='line_26853'>let bury him by his sister and by Galahad in the spiritualities.</a>
<a id='line_26854'></a>
<a id='line_26855'>When Bors saw that he was in so far countries as in the parts of</a>
<a id='line_26856'>Babylon he departed from Sarras, and armed him and came to the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_26857'>entered into a ship; and so it befell him in good adventure he came</a>
<a id='line_26858'>into the realm of Logris; and he rode so fast till he came to Camelot</a>
<a id='line_26859'>where the king was. And then was there great joy made of him in the</a>
<a id='line_26860'>court, for they weened all he had been dead, forasmuch as he had been</a>
<a id='line_26861'>so long out of the country. And when they had eaten, the king made</a>
<a id='line_26862'>great clerks to come afore him, that they should chronicle of the high</a>
<a id='line_26863'>adventures of the good knights. When Bors had told him of the</a>
<a id='line_26864'>adventures of the Sangreal, such as had befallen him and his three</a>
<a id='line_26865'>fellows, that was Launcelot, Percivale, Galahad, and himself, there</a>
<a id='line_26866'>Launcelot told the adventures of the Sangreal that he had seen. All</a>
<a id='line_26867'>this was made in great books, and put up in almeries at Salisbury. And</a>
<a id='line_26868'>anon Sir Bors said to Sir Launcelot: Galahad, your own son, saluted you</a>
<a id='line_26869'>by me, and after you King Arthur and all the court, and so did Sir</a>
<a id='line_26870'>Percivale, for I buried them with mine own hands in the city of Sarras.</a>
<a id='line_26871'>Also, Sir Launcelot, Galahad prayed you to remember of this unsiker</a>
<a id='line_26872'>world as ye behight him when ye were together more than half a year.</a>
<a id='line_26873'>This is true, said Launcelot; now I trust to God his prayer shall avail</a>
<a id='line_26874'>me.</a>
<a id='line_26875'></a>
<a id='line_26876'>Then Launcelot took Sir Bors in his arms, and said: Gentle cousin, ye</a>
<a id='line_26877'>are right welcome to me, and all that ever I may do for you and for</a>
<a id='line_26878'>yours ye shall find my poor body ready at all times, while the spirit</a>
<a id='line_26879'>is in it, and that I promise you faithfully, and never to fail. And wit</a>
<a id='line_26880'>ye well, gentle cousin, Sir Bors, that ye and I will never depart</a>
<a id='line_26881'>asunder whilst our lives may last. Sir, said he, I will as ye will.</a>
<a id='line_26882'></a>
<a id='line_26883'>_Thus endeth the history of the Sangreal, that was briefly drawn out of</a>
<a id='line_26884'>French into English, the which is a story chronicled for one of the</a>
<a id='line_26885'>truest and the holiest that is in this world, the which is the xvii</a>

<a id='line_26896'></a>
<a id='line_26897'></a>
<a id='line_26898'>CHAPTER I. Of the joy King Arthur and the queen had of the achievement</a>
<a id='line_26899'>of the Sangreal; and how Launcelot fell to his old love again.</a>
<a id='line_26900'></a>
<a id='line_26901'></a>
<a id='line_26902'>So after the quest of the Sangreal was fulfilled, and all knights that</a>
<a id='line_26903'>were left alive were come again unto the Table Round, as the book of</a>
<a id='line_26904'>the Sangreal maketh mention, then was there great joy in the court; and</a>
<a id='line_26905'>in especial King Arthur and Queen Guenever made great joy of the</a>
<a id='line_26906'>remnant that were come home, and passing glad was the king and the</a>
<a id='line_26907'>queen of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Bors, for they had been passing long</a>
<a id='line_26908'>away in the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_26909'></a>
<a id='line_26910'>Then, as the book saith, Sir Launcelot began to resort unto Queen</a>
<a id='line_26911'>Guenever again, and forgat the promise and the perfection that he made</a>
<a id='line_26912'>in the quest. For, as the book saith, had not Sir Launcelot been in his</a>
<a id='line_26913'>privy thoughts and in his mind so set inwardly to the queen as he was</a>
<a id='line_26914'>in seeming outward to God, there had no knight passed him in the quest</a>
<a id='line_26915'>of the Sangreal; but ever his thoughts were privily on the queen, and</a>
<a id='line_26916'>so they loved together more hotter than they did to-forehand, and had</a>
<a id='line_26917'>such privy draughts together, that many in the court spake of it, and</a>
<a id='line_26918'>in especial Sir Agravaine, Sir Gawaine’s brother, for he was ever</a>
<a id='line_26919'>open-mouthed.</a>
<a id='line_26920'></a>
<a id='line_26921'>So befell that Sir Launcelot had many resorts of ladies and damosels</a>
<a id='line_26922'>that daily resorted unto him, that besought him to be their champion,</a>
<a id='line_26923'>and in all such matters of right Sir Launcelot applied him daily to do</a>
<a id='line_26924'>for the pleasure of Our Lord, Jesu Christ. And ever as much as he might</a>
<a id='line_26925'>he withdrew him from the company and fellowship of Queen Guenever, for</a>
<a id='line_26926'>to eschew the slander and noise; wherefore the queen waxed wroth with</a>
<a id='line_26927'>Sir Launcelot. And upon a day she called Sir Launcelot unto her</a>
<a id='line_26928'>chamber, and said thus: Sir Launcelot, I see and feel daily that thy</a>
<a id='line_26929'>love beginneth to slake, for thou hast no joy to be in my presence, but</a>
<a id='line_26930'>ever thou art out of this court, and quarrels and matters thou hast</a>
<a id='line_26931'>nowadays for ladies and gentlewomen more than ever thou wert wont to</a>
<a id='line_26932'>have aforehand.</a>
<a id='line_26933'></a>
<a id='line_26934'>Ah madam, said Launcelot, in this ye must hold me excused for divers</a>
<a id='line_26935'>causes; one is, I was but late in the quest of the Sangreal; and I</a>
<a id='line_26936'>thank God of his great mercy, and never of my desert, that I saw in</a>
<a id='line_26937'>that my quest as much as ever saw any sinful man, and so was it told</a>
<a id='line_26938'>me. And if I had not had my privy thoughts to return to your love again</a>
<a id='line_26939'>as I do, I had seen as great mysteries as ever saw my son Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_26940'>outher Percivale, or Sir Bors; and therefore, madam, I was but late in</a>
<a id='line_26941'>that quest. Wit ye well, madam, it may not be yet lightly forgotten the</a>
<a id='line_26942'>high service in whom I did my diligent labour. Also, madam, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_26943'>that there be many men speak of our love in this court, and have you</a>
<a id='line_26944'>and me greatly in await, as Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred; and madam,</a>
<a id='line_26945'>wit ye well I dread them more for your sake than for any fear I have of</a>
<a id='line_26946'>them myself, for I may happen to escape and rid myself in a great need,</a>
<a id='line_26947'>where ye must abide all that will be said unto you. And then if that ye</a>
<a id='line_26948'>fall in any distress through wilful folly, then is there none other</a>
<a id='line_26949'>remedy or help but by me and my blood. And wit ye well, madam, the</a>
<a id='line_26950'>boldness of you and me will bring us to great shame and slander; and</a>
<a id='line_26951'>that were me loath to see you dishonoured. And that is the cause I take</a>
<a id='line_26952'>upon me more for to do for damosels and maidens than ever I did</a>
<a id='line_26953'>to-fore, that men should understand my joy and my delight is my</a>
<a id='line_26954'>pleasure to have ado for damosels and maidens.</a>
<a id='line_26955'></a>
<a id='line_26956'></a>
<a id='line_26957'></a>
<a id='line_26958'></a>
<a id='line_26959'>CHAPTER II. How the queen commanded Sir Launcelot to avoid the court,</a>
<a id='line_26960'>and of the sorrow that Launcelot made.</a>
<a id='line_26961'></a>
<a id='line_26962'></a>
<a id='line_26963'>All this while the queen stood still and let Sir Launcelot say what he</a>
<a id='line_26964'>would. And when he had all said she brast out a-weeping, and so she</a>
<a id='line_26965'>sobbed and wept a great while. And when she might speak she said:</a>
<a id='line_26966'>Launcelot, now I well understand that thou art a false recreant knight</a>
<a id='line_26967'>and a common lecher, and lovest and holdest other ladies, and by me</a>
<a id='line_26968'>thou hast disdain and scorn. For wit thou well, she said, now I</a>
<a id='line_26969'>understand thy falsehood, and therefore shall I never love thee no</a>
<a id='line_26970'>more. And never be thou so hardy to come in my sight; and right here I</a>
<a id='line_26971'>discharge thee this court, that thou never come within it; and I</a>
<a id='line_26972'>forfend thee my fellowship, and upon pain of thy head that thou see me</a>
<a id='line_26973'>no more. Right so Sir Launcelot departed with great heaviness, that</a>
<a id='line_26974'>unnethe he might sustain himself for great dole-making.</a>
<a id='line_26975'></a>
<a id='line_26976'>Then he called Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel, and told</a>
<a id='line_26977'>them how the queen had forfended him the court, and so he was in will</a>
<a id='line_26978'>to depart into his own country. Fair sir, said Sir Bors de Ganis, ye</a>
<a id='line_26979'>shall not depart out of this land by mine advice. Ye must remember in</a>
<a id='line_26980'>what honour ye are renowned, and called the noblest knight of the</a>
<a id='line_26981'>world; and many great matters ye have in hand. And women in their</a>
<a id='line_26982'>hastiness will do ofttimes that sore repenteth them; and therefore by</a>
<a id='line_26983'>mine advice ye shall take your horse, and ride to the good hermitage</a>
<a id='line_26984'>here beside Windsor, that sometime was a good knight, his name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_26985'>Brasias, and there shall ye abide till I send you word of better</a>
<a id='line_26986'>tidings. Brother, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well I am full loath to</a>
<a id='line_26987'>depart out of this realm, but the queen hath defended me so highly,</a>
<a id='line_26988'>that meseemeth she will never be my good lady as she hath been. Say ye</a>
<a id='line_26989'>never so, said Sir Bors, for many times or this time she hath been</a>
<a id='line_26990'>wroth with you, and after it she was the first that repented it. Ye say</a>
<a id='line_26991'>well, said Launcelot, for now will I do by your counsel, and take mine</a>
<a id='line_26992'>horse and my harness, and ride to the hermit Sir Brasias, and there</a>
<a id='line_26993'>will I repose me until I hear some manner of tidings from you; but,</a>
<a id='line_26994'>fair brother, I pray you get me the love of my lady, Queen Guenever, an</a>
<a id='line_26995'>ye may. Sir, said Sir Bors, ye need not to move me of such matters, for</a>
<a id='line_26996'>well ye wot I will do what I may to please you.</a>
<a id='line_26997'></a>
<a id='line_26998'>And then the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, departed with right heavy</a>
<a id='line_26999'>cheer suddenly, that none earthly creature wist of him, nor where he</a>
<a id='line_27000'>was become, but Sir Bors. So when Sir Launcelot was departed, the queen</a>
<a id='line_27001'>outward made no manner of sorrow in showing to none of his blood nor to</a>
<a id='line_27002'>none other. But wit ye well, inwardly, as the book saith, she took</a>
<a id='line_27003'>great thought, but she bare it out with a proud countenance as though</a>
<a id='line_27004'>she felt nothing nor danger.</a>
<a id='line_27005'></a>
<a id='line_27006'></a>
<a id='line_27007'></a>
<a id='line_27008'></a>
<a id='line_27009'>CHAPTER III. How at a dinner that the queen made there was a knight</a>
<a id='line_27010'>enpoisoned, which Sir Mador laid on the queen.</a>
<a id='line_27011'></a>
<a id='line_27012'></a>
<a id='line_27013'>And then the queen let make a privy dinner in London unto the knights</a>
<a id='line_27014'>of the Round Table. And all was for to show outward that she had as</a>
<a id='line_27015'>great joy in all other knights of the Table Round as she had in Sir</a>
<a id='line_27016'>Launcelot. All only at that dinner she had Sir Gawaine and his</a>
<a id='line_27017'>brethren, that is for to say Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_27018'>and Sir Mordred. Also there was Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Blamore de</a>
<a id='line_27019'>Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_27020'>Maris, Sir Lionel, Sir Palomides, Safere his brother, Sir La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_27021'>Taile, Sir Persant, Sir Ironside, Sir Brandiles, Sir Kay le Seneschal,</a>
<a id='line_27022'>Sir Mador de la Porte, Sir Patrise, a knight of Ireland, Aliduk, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27023'>Astamore, and Sir Pinel le Savage, the which was cousin to Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_27024'>de Galis, the good knight that Sir Gawaine and his brethren slew by</a>
<a id='line_27025'>treason. And so these four-and-twenty knights should dine with the</a>
<a id='line_27026'>queen in a privy place by themself, and there was made a great feast of</a>
<a id='line_27027'>all manner of dainties.</a>
<a id='line_27028'></a>
<a id='line_27029'>But Sir Gawaine had a custom that he used daily at dinner and at</a>
<a id='line_27030'>supper, that he loved well all manner of fruit, and in especial apples</a>
<a id='line_27031'>and pears. And therefore whosomever dined or feasted Sir Gawaine would</a>
<a id='line_27032'>commonly purvey for good fruit for him, and so did the queen for to</a>
<a id='line_27033'>please Sir Gawaine; she let purvey for him all manner of fruit, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_27034'>Gawaine was a passing hot knight of nature. And this Pinel hated Sir</a>
<a id='line_27035'>Gawaine because of his kinsman Sir Lamorak de Galis; and therefore for</a>
<a id='line_27036'>pure envy and hate Sir Pinel enpoisoned certain apples for to enpoison</a>
<a id='line_27037'>Sir Gawaine. And so this was well unto the end of the meat; and so it</a>
<a id='line_27038'>befell by misfortune a good knight named Patrise, cousin unto Sir Mador</a>
<a id='line_27039'>de la Porte, to take a poisoned apple. And when he had eaten it he</a>
<a id='line_27040'>swelled so till he brast, and there Sir Patrise fell down suddenly dead</a>
<a id='line_27041'>among them.</a>
<a id='line_27042'></a>
<a id='line_27043'>Then every knight leapt from the board ashamed, and araged for wrath,</a>
<a id='line_27044'>nigh out of their wits. For they wist not what to say; considering</a>
<a id='line_27045'>Queen Guenever made the feast and dinner, they all had suspicion unto</a>
<a id='line_27046'>her. My lady, the queen, said Gawaine, wit ye well, madam, that this</a>
<a id='line_27047'>dinner was made for me, for all folks that know my condition understand</a>
<a id='line_27048'>that I love well fruit, and now I see well I had near been slain;</a>
<a id='line_27049'>therefore, madam, I dread me lest ye will be shamed. Then the queen</a>
<a id='line_27050'>stood still and was sore abashed, that she nist not what to say. This</a>
<a id='line_27051'>shall not so be ended, said Sir Mador de la Porte, for here have I lost</a>
<a id='line_27052'>a full noble knight of my blood; and therefore upon this shame and</a>
<a id='line_27053'>despite I will be revenged to the utterance. And there openly Sir Mador</a>
<a id='line_27054'>appealed the queen of the death of his cousin, Sir Patrise. Then stood</a>
<a id='line_27055'>they all still, that none would speak a word against him, for they all</a>
<a id='line_27056'>had great suspicion unto the queen because she let make that dinner.</a>
<a id='line_27057'>And the queen was so abashed that she could none other ways do, but</a>
<a id='line_27058'>wept so heartily that she fell in a swoon. With this noise and cry came</a>
<a id='line_27059'>to them King Arthur, and when he wist of that trouble he was a passing</a>
<a id='line_27060'>heavy man.</a>
<a id='line_27061'></a>
<a id='line_27062'></a>
<a id='line_27063'></a>
<a id='line_27064'></a>
<a id='line_27065'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Mador appeached the queen of treason, and there was</a>
<a id='line_27066'>no knight would fight for her at the first time.</a>
<a id='line_27067'></a>
<a id='line_27068'></a>
<a id='line_27069'>And ever Sir Mador stood still afore the king, and ever he appealed the</a>
<a id='line_27070'>queen of treason; for the custom was such that time that all manner of</a>
<a id='line_27071'>shameful death was called treason. Fair lords, said King Arthur, me</a>
<a id='line_27072'>repenteth of this trouble, but the case is so I may not have ado in</a>
<a id='line_27073'>this matter, for I must be a rightful judge; and that repenteth me that</a>
<a id='line_27074'>I may not do battle for my wife, for as I deem this deed came never by</a>
<a id='line_27075'>her. And therefore I suppose she shall not be all distained, but that</a>
<a id='line_27076'>some good knight shall put his body in jeopardy for my queen rather</a>
<a id='line_27077'>than she shall be brent in a wrong quarrel. And therefore, Sir Mador,</a>
<a id='line_27078'>be not so hasty, for it may happen she shall not be all friendless; and</a>
<a id='line_27079'>therefore desire thou thy day of battle, and she shall purvey her of</a>
<a id='line_27080'>some good knight that shall answer you, or else it were to me great</a>
<a id='line_27081'>shame, and to all my court.</a>
<a id='line_27082'></a>
<a id='line_27083'>My gracious lord, said Sir Mador, ye must hold me excused, for though</a>
<a id='line_27084'>ye be our king in that degree, ye are but a knight as we are, and ye</a>
<a id='line_27085'>are sworn unto knighthood as well as we; and therefore I beseech you</a>
<a id='line_27086'>that ye be not displeased, for there is none of the four-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_27087'>knights that were bidden to this dinner but all they have great</a>
<a id='line_27088'>suspicion unto the queen. What say ye all, my lords? said Sir Mador.</a>
<a id='line_27089'>Then they answered by and by that they could not excuse the queen; for</a>
<a id='line_27090'>why she made the dinner, and either it must come by her or by her</a>
<a id='line_27091'>servants. Alas, said the queen, I made this dinner for a good intent,</a>
<a id='line_27092'>and never for none evil, so Almighty God me help in my right, as I was</a>
<a id='line_27093'>never purposed to do such evil deeds, and that I report me unto God.</a>
<a id='line_27094'></a>
<a id='line_27095'>My lord, the king, said Sir Mador, I require you as ye be a righteous</a>
<a id='line_27096'>king give me a day that I may have justice. Well, said the king, I give</a>
<a id='line_27097'>the day this day fifteen days that thou be ready armed on horseback in</a>
<a id='line_27098'>the meadow beside Westminster. And if it so fall that there be any</a>
<a id='line_27099'>knight to encounter with you, there mayst thou do the best, and God</a>
<a id='line_27100'>speed the right. And if it so fall that there be no knight at that day,</a>
<a id='line_27101'>then must my queen be burnt, and there she shall be ready to have her</a>
<a id='line_27102'>judgment. I am answered, said Sir Mador. And every knight went where it</a>
<a id='line_27103'>liked them.</a>
<a id='line_27104'></a>
<a id='line_27105'>So when the king and the queen were together the king asked the queen</a>
<a id='line_27106'>how this case befell. The queen answered: So God me help, I wot not how</a>
<a id='line_27107'>or in what manner. Where is Sir Launcelot? said King Arthur; an he were</a>
<a id='line_27108'>here he would not grudge to do battle for you. Sir, said the queen, I</a>
<a id='line_27109'>wot not where he is, but his brother and his kinsmen deem that he be</a>
<a id='line_27110'>not within this realm. That me repenteth, said King Arthur, for an he</a>
<a id='line_27111'>were here he would soon stint this strife. Then I will counsel you,</a>
<a id='line_27112'>said the king, and unto Sir Bors: That ye will do battle for her for</a>
<a id='line_27113'>Sir Launcelot’s sake, and upon my life he will not refuse you. For well</a>
<a id='line_27114'>I see, said the king, that none of these four-and-twenty knights that</a>
<a id='line_27115'>were with you at your dinner where Sir Patrise was slain, that will do</a>
<a id='line_27116'>battle for you, nor none of them will say well of you, and that shall</a>
<a id='line_27117'>be a great slander for you in this court. Alas, said the queen, and I</a>
<a id='line_27118'>may not do withal, but now I miss Sir Launcelot, for an he were here he</a>
<a id='line_27119'>would put me soon to my heart’s ease. What aileth you, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_27120'>ye cannot keep Sir Launcelot upon your side? For wit ye well, said the</a>
<a id='line_27121'>king, who that hath Sir Launcelot upon his part hath the most man of</a>
<a id='line_27122'>worship in the world upon his side. Now go your way, said the king unto</a>
<a id='line_27123'>the queen, and require Sir Bors to do battle for you for Sir</a>
<a id='line_27124'>Launcelot’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_27125'></a>
<a id='line_27126'></a>
<a id='line_27127'></a>
<a id='line_27128'></a>
<a id='line_27129'>CHAPTER V. How the queen required Sir Bors to fight for her, and how he</a>
<a id='line_27130'>granted upon condition; and how he warned Sir Launcelot thereof.</a>
<a id='line_27131'></a>
<a id='line_27132'></a>
<a id='line_27133'>So the queen departed from the king, and sent for Sir Bors into her</a>
<a id='line_27134'>chamber. And when he was come she besought him of succour. Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_27135'>he, what would ye that I did? for I may not with my worship have ado in</a>
<a id='line_27136'>this matter, because I was at the same dinner, for dread that any of</a>
<a id='line_27137'>those knights would have me in suspicion. Also, madam, said Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_27138'>now miss ye Sir Launcelot, for he would not have failed you neither in</a>
<a id='line_27139'>right nor in wrong, as ye have well proved when ye have been in danger;</a>
<a id='line_27140'>and now ye have driven him out of this country, by whom ye and all we</a>
<a id='line_27141'>were daily worshipped by; therefore, madam, I marvel how ye dare for</a>
<a id='line_27142'>shame require me to do any thing for you, in so much ye have chased him</a>
<a id='line_27143'>out of your country by whom we were borne up and honoured. Alas, fair</a>
<a id='line_27144'>knight, said the queen, I put me wholly in your grace, and all that is</a>
<a id='line_27145'>done amiss I will amend as ye will counsel me. And therewith she</a>
<a id='line_27146'>kneeled down upon both her knees, and besought Sir Bors to have mercy</a>
<a id='line_27147'>upon her: Outher I shall have a shameful death, and thereto I never</a>
<a id='line_27148'>offended.</a>
<a id='line_27149'></a>
<a id='line_27150'>Right so came King Arthur, and found the queen kneeling afore Sir Bors;</a>
<a id='line_27151'>then Sir Bors pulled her up, and said: Madam, ye do me great dishonour.</a>
<a id='line_27152'>Ah, gentle knight, said the king, have mercy upon my queen, courteous</a>
<a id='line_27153'>knight, for I am now in certain she is untruly defamed. And therefore,</a>
<a id='line_27154'>courteous knight, said the king, promise her to do battle for her, I</a>
<a id='line_27155'>require you for the love of Sir Launcelot. My lord, said Sir Bors, ye</a>
<a id='line_27156'>require me the greatest thing that any man may require me; and wit ye</a>
<a id='line_27157'>well if I grant to do battle for the queen I shall wrath many of my</a>
<a id='line_27158'>fellowship of the Table Round. But as for that, said Bors, I will grant</a>
<a id='line_27159'>my lord that for my lord Sir Launcelot’s sake, and for your sake I will</a>
<a id='line_27160'>at that day be the queen’s champion unless that there come by adventure</a>
<a id='line_27161'>a better knight than I am to do battle for her. Will ye promise me</a>
<a id='line_27162'>this, said the king, by your faith? Yea sir, said Sir Bors, of that I</a>
<a id='line_27163'>will not fail you, nor her both, but if there come a better knight than</a>
<a id='line_27164'>I am, and then shall he have the battle. Then was the king and the</a>
<a id='line_27165'>queen passing glad, and so departed, and thanked him heartily.</a>
<a id='line_27166'></a>
<a id='line_27167'>So then Sir Bors departed secretly upon a day, and rode unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_27168'>Launcelot thereas he was with the hermit, Sir Brasias, and told him of</a>
<a id='line_27169'>all their adventure. Ah Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, this is come happily</a>
<a id='line_27170'>as I would have it, and therefore I pray you make you ready to do</a>
<a id='line_27171'>battle, but look that ye tarry till ye see me come, as long as ye may.</a>
<a id='line_27172'>For I am sure Mador is an hot knight when he is enchafed, for the more</a>
<a id='line_27173'>ye suffer him the hastier will he be to battle. Sir, said Bors, let me</a>
<a id='line_27174'>deal with him, doubt ye not ye shall have all your will. Then departed</a>
<a id='line_27175'>Sir Bors from him and came to the court again. Then was it noised in</a>
<a id='line_27176'>all the court that Sir Bors should do battle for the queen; wherefore</a>
<a id='line_27177'>many knights were displeased with him, that he would take upon him to</a>
<a id='line_27178'>do battle in the queen’s quarrel; for there were but few knights in all</a>
<a id='line_27179'>the court but they deemed the queen was in the wrong, and that she had</a>
<a id='line_27180'>done that treason.</a>
<a id='line_27181'></a>
<a id='line_27182'>So Sir Bors answered thus to his fellows of the Table Round: Wit ye</a>
<a id='line_27183'>well, my fair lords, it were shame to us all an we suffered to see the</a>
<a id='line_27184'>most noble queen of the world to be shamed openly, considering her lord</a>
<a id='line_27185'>and our lord is the man of most worship in the world, and most</a>
<a id='line_27186'>christened, and he hath ever worshipped us all in all places. Many</a>
<a id='line_27187'>answered him again: As for our most noble King Arthur, we love him and</a>
<a id='line_27188'>honour him as well as ye do, but as for Queen Guenever we love her not,</a>
<a id='line_27189'>because she is a destroyer of good knights. Fair lords, said Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_27190'>meseemeth ye say not as ye should say, for never yet in my days knew I</a>
<a id='line_27191'>never nor heard say that ever she was a destroyer of any good knight.</a>
<a id='line_27192'>But at all times as far as ever I could know she was a maintainer of</a>
<a id='line_27193'>good knights; and ever she hath been large and free of her goods to all</a>
<a id='line_27194'>good knights, and the most bounteous lady of her gifts and her good</a>
<a id='line_27195'>grace, that ever I saw or heard speak of. And therefore it were shame,</a>
<a id='line_27196'>said Sir Bors, to us all to our most noble king’s wife, an we suffered</a>
<a id='line_27197'>her to be shamefully slain. And wit ye well, said Sir Bors, I will not</a>
<a id='line_27198'>suffer it, for I dare say so much, the queen is not guilty of Sir</a>
<a id='line_27199'>Patrise’s death, for she owed him never none ill will, nor none of the</a>
<a id='line_27200'>four-and-twenty knights that were at that dinner; for I dare say for</a>
<a id='line_27201'>good love she bade us to dinner, and not for no mal engine, and that I</a>
<a id='line_27202'>doubt not shall be proved hereafter, for howsomever the game goeth,</a>
<a id='line_27203'>there was treason among us. Then some said to Sir Bors: We may well</a>
<a id='line_27204'>believe your words. And so some of them were well pleased, and some</a>
<a id='line_27205'>were not so.</a>
<a id='line_27206'></a>
<a id='line_27207'></a>
<a id='line_27208'></a>
<a id='line_27209'></a>
<a id='line_27210'>CHAPTER VI. How at the day Sir Bors made him ready for to fight for the</a>
<a id='line_27211'>queen; and when he would fight how another discharged him.</a>
<a id='line_27212'></a>
<a id='line_27213'></a>
<a id='line_27214'>The day came on fast until the even that the battle should be. Then the</a>
<a id='line_27215'>queen sent for Sir Bors and asked him how he was disposed. Truly madam,</a>
<a id='line_27216'>said he, I am disposed in likewise as I promised you, that is for to</a>
<a id='line_27217'>say I shall not fail you, unless by adventure there come a better</a>
<a id='line_27218'>knight than I am to do battle for you, then, madam, am I discharged of</a>
<a id='line_27219'>my promise. Will ye, said the queen, that I tell my lord Arthur thus?</a>
<a id='line_27220'>Do as it shall please you, madam. Then the queen went unto the king and</a>
<a id='line_27221'>told him the answer of Sir Bors. Have ye no doubt, said the king, of</a>
<a id='line_27222'>Sir Bors, for I call him now one of the best knights of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_27223'>the most profitablest man. And thus it passed on until the morn, and</a>
<a id='line_27224'>the king and the queen and all manner of knights that were there at</a>
<a id='line_27225'>that time drew them unto the meadow beside Westminster where the battle</a>
<a id='line_27226'>should be. And so when the king was come with the queen and many</a>
<a id='line_27227'>knights of the Round Table, then the queen was put there in the</a>
<a id='line_27228'>Constable’s ward, and a great fire made about an iron stake, that an</a>
<a id='line_27229'>Sir Mador de la Porte had the better, she should be burnt: such custom</a>
<a id='line_27230'>was used in those days, that neither for favour, neither for love nor</a>
<a id='line_27231'>affinity, there should be none other but righteous judgment, as well</a>
<a id='line_27232'>upon a king as upon a knight, and as well upon a queen as upon another</a>
<a id='line_27233'>poor lady.</a>
<a id='line_27234'></a>
<a id='line_27235'>So in this meanwhile came in Sir Mador de la Porte, and took his oath</a>
<a id='line_27236'>afore the king, that the queen did this treason until his cousin Sir</a>
<a id='line_27237'>Patrise, and unto his oath he would prove it with his body, hand for</a>
<a id='line_27238'>hand, who that would say the contrary. Right so came in Sir Bors de</a>
<a id='line_27239'>Ganis, and said: That as for Queen Guenever she is in the right, and</a>
<a id='line_27240'>that will I make good with my hands that she is not culpable of this</a>
<a id='line_27241'>treason that is put upon her. Then make thee ready, said Sir Mador, and</a>
<a id='line_27242'>we shall prove whether thou be in the right or I. Sir Mador, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27243'>Bors, wit thou well I know you for a good knight. Not for then I shall</a>
<a id='line_27244'>not fear you so greatly, but I trust to God I shall be able to</a>
<a id='line_27245'>withstand your malice. But this much have I promised my lord Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_27246'>my lady the queen, that I shall do battle for her in this case to the</a>
<a id='line_27247'>uttermost, unless that there come a better knight than I am and</a>
<a id='line_27248'>discharge me. Is that all? said Sir Mador, either come thou off and do</a>
<a id='line_27249'>battle with me, or else say nay. Take your horse, said Sir Bors, and as</a>
<a id='line_27250'>I suppose, ye shall not tarry long but ye shall be answered.</a>
<a id='line_27251'></a>
<a id='line_27252'>Then either departed to their tents and made them ready to horseback as</a>
<a id='line_27253'>they thought best. And anon Sir Mador came into the field with his</a>
<a id='line_27254'>shield on his shoulder and his spear in his hand; and so rode about the</a>
<a id='line_27255'>place crying unto Arthur: Bid your champion come forth an he dare. Then</a>
<a id='line_27256'>was Sir Bors ashamed and took his horse and came to the lists’ end. And</a>
<a id='line_27257'>then was he ware where came from a wood there fast by a knight all</a>
<a id='line_27258'>armed, upon a white horse, with a strange shield of strange arms; and</a>
<a id='line_27259'>he came riding all that he might run, and so he came to Sir Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_27260'>said thus: Fair knight, I pray you be not displeased, for here must a</a>
<a id='line_27261'>better knight than ye are have this battle, therefore I pray you</a>
<a id='line_27262'>withdraw you. For wit ye well I have had this day a right great</a>
<a id='line_27263'>journey, and this battle ought to be mine, and so I promised you when I</a>
<a id='line_27264'>spake with you last, and with all my heart I thank you of your good</a>
<a id='line_27265'>will. Then Sir Bors rode unto King Arthur and told him how there was a</a>
<a id='line_27266'>knight come that would have the battle for to fight for the queen. What</a>
<a id='line_27267'>knight is he? said the king. I wot not, said Sir Bors, but such</a>
<a id='line_27268'>covenant he made with me to be here this day. Now my lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27269'>Bors, here am I discharged.</a>
<a id='line_27270'></a>
<a id='line_27271'></a>
<a id='line_27272'></a>
<a id='line_27273'></a>
<a id='line_27274'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot fought against Sir Mador for the queen,</a>
<a id='line_27275'>and how he overcame Sir Mador, and discharged the queen.</a>
<a id='line_27276'></a>
<a id='line_27277'></a>
<a id='line_27278'>Then the king called to that knight, and asked him if he would fight</a>
<a id='line_27279'>for the queen. Then he answered to the king: Therefore came I hither,</a>
<a id='line_27280'>and therefore, sir king, he said, tarry me no longer, for I may not</a>
<a id='line_27281'>tarry. For anon as I have finished this battle I must depart hence, for</a>
<a id='line_27282'>I have ado many matters elsewhere. For wit you well, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_27283'>this is dishonour to you all knights of the Round Table, to see and</a>
<a id='line_27284'>know so noble a lady and so courteous a queen as Queen Guenever is,</a>
<a id='line_27285'>thus to be rebuked and shamed amongst you. Then they all marvelled what</a>
<a id='line_27286'>knight that might be that so took the battle upon him. For there was</a>
<a id='line_27287'>not one that knew him, but if it were Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_27288'></a>
<a id='line_27289'>Then said Sir Mador de la Porte unto the king: Now let me wit with whom</a>
<a id='line_27290'>I shall have ado withal. And then they rode to the lists’ end, and</a>
<a id='line_27291'>there they couched their spears, and ran together with all their might,</a>
<a id='line_27292'>and Sir Mador’s spear brake all to pieces, but the other’s spear held,</a>
<a id='line_27293'>and bare Sir Mador’s horse and all backward to the earth a great fall.</a>
<a id='line_27294'>But mightily and suddenly he avoided his horse and put his shield afore</a>
<a id='line_27295'>him, and then drew his sword, and bade the other knight alight and do</a>
<a id='line_27296'>battle with him on foot. Then that knight descended from his horse</a>
<a id='line_27297'>lightly like a valiant man, and put his shield afore him and drew his</a>
<a id='line_27298'>sword; and so they came eagerly unto battle, and either gave other many</a>
<a id='line_27299'>great strokes, tracing and traversing, racing and foining, and hurtling</a>
<a id='line_27300'>together with their swords as it were wild boars. Thus were they</a>
<a id='line_27301'>fighting nigh an hour, for this Sir Mador was a strong knight, and</a>
<a id='line_27302'>mightily proved in many strong battles. But at the last this knight</a>
<a id='line_27303'>smote Sir Mador grovelling upon the earth, and the knight stepped near</a>
<a id='line_27304'>him to have pulled Sir Mador flatling upon the ground; and therewith</a>
<a id='line_27305'>suddenly Sir Mador arose, and in his rising he smote that knight</a>
<a id='line_27306'>through the thick of the thighs that the blood ran out fiercely. And</a>
<a id='line_27307'>when he felt himself so wounded, and saw his blood, he let him arise</a>
<a id='line_27308'>upon his feet. And then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he</a>
<a id='line_27309'>fell to the earth flatling, and therewith he strode to him to have</a>
<a id='line_27310'>pulled off his helm off his head. And then Sir Mador prayed that knight</a>
<a id='line_27311'>to save his life, and so he yielded him as overcome, and released the</a>
<a id='line_27312'>queen of his quarrel. I will not grant thee thy life, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_27313'>only that thou freely release the queen for ever, and that no mention</a>
<a id='line_27314'>be made upon Sir Patrise’s tomb that ever Queen Guenever consented to</a>
<a id='line_27315'>that treason. All this shall be done, said Sir Mador, I clearly</a>
<a id='line_27316'>discharge my quarrel for ever.</a>
<a id='line_27317'></a>
<a id='line_27318'>Then the knights parters of the lists took up Sir Mador, and led him to</a>
<a id='line_27319'>his tent, and the other knight went straight to the stair-foot where</a>
<a id='line_27320'>sat King Arthur; and by that time was the queen come to the king, and</a>
<a id='line_27321'>either kissed other heartily. And when the king saw that knight, he</a>
<a id='line_27322'>stooped down to him, and thanked him, and in likewise did the queen;</a>
<a id='line_27323'>and the king prayed him to put off his helmet, and to repose him, and</a>
<a id='line_27324'>to take a sop of wine. And then he put off his helm to drink, and then</a>
<a id='line_27325'>every knight knew him that it was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Anon as the</a>
<a id='line_27326'>king wist that, he took the queen in his hand, and yode unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_27327'>Launcelot, and said: Sir, grant mercy of your great travail that ye</a>
<a id='line_27328'>have had this day for me and for my queen. My lord, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_27329'>wit ye well I ought of right ever to be in your quarrel, and in my lady</a>
<a id='line_27330'>the queen’s quarrel, to do battle; for ye are the man that gave me the</a>
<a id='line_27331'>high order of knighthood, and that day my lady, your queen, did me</a>
<a id='line_27332'>great worship, and else I had been shamed; for that same day ye made me</a>
<a id='line_27333'>knight, through my hastiness I lost my sword, and my lady, your queen,</a>
<a id='line_27334'>found it, and lapped it in her train, and gave me my sword when I had</a>
<a id='line_27335'>need thereto, and else had I been shamed among all knights; and</a>
<a id='line_27336'>therefore, my lord Arthur, I promised her at that day ever to be her</a>
<a id='line_27337'>knight in right outher in wrong. Grant mercy, said the king, for this</a>
<a id='line_27338'>journey; and wit ye well, said the king, I shall acquit your goodness.</a>
<a id='line_27339'></a>
<a id='line_27340'>And ever the queen beheld Sir Launcelot, and wept so tenderly that she</a>
<a id='line_27341'>sank almost to the ground for sorrow that he had done to her so great</a>
<a id='line_27342'>goodness where she shewed him great unkindness. Then the knights of his</a>
<a id='line_27343'>blood drew unto him, and there either of them made great joy of other.</a>
<a id='line_27344'>And so came all the knights of the Table Round that were there at that</a>
<a id='line_27345'>time, and welcomed him. And then Sir Mador was had to leech-craft, and</a>
<a id='line_27346'>Sir Launcelot was healed of his wound. And then there was made great</a>
<a id='line_27347'>joy and mirths in that court.</a>
<a id='line_27348'></a>

<a id='line_27351'></a>
<a id='line_27352'>CHAPTER VIII. How the truth was known by the Maiden of the Lake, and of</a>
<a id='line_27353'>divers other matters.</a>
<a id='line_27354'></a>
<a id='line_27355'></a>
<a id='line_27356'>And so it befell that the damosel of the lake, her name was Nimue, the</a>
<a id='line_27357'>which wedded the good knight Sir Pelleas, and so she came to the court;</a>
<a id='line_27358'>for ever she did great goodness unto King Arthur and to all his knights</a>
<a id='line_27359'>through her sorcery and enchantments. And so when she heard how the</a>
<a id='line_27360'>queen was an-angered for the death of Sir Patrise, then she told it</a>
<a id='line_27361'>openly that she was never guilty; and there she disclosed by whom it</a>
<a id='line_27362'>was done, and named him, Sir Pinel; and for what cause he did it, there</a>
<a id='line_27363'>it was openly disclosed; and so the queen was excused, and the knight</a>
<a id='line_27364'>Pinel fled into his country. Then was it openly known that Sir Pinel</a>
<a id='line_27365'>enpoisoned the apples at the feast to that intent to have destroyed Sir</a>
<a id='line_27366'>Gawaine, because Sir Gawaine and his brethren destroyed Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_27367'>Galis, to the which Sir Pinel was cousin unto. Then was Sir Patrise</a>
<a id='line_27368'>buried in the church of Westminster in a tomb, and thereupon was</a>
<a id='line_27369'>written: Here lieth Sir Patrise of Ireland, slain by Sir Pinel le</a>
<a id='line_27370'>Savage, that enpoisoned apples to have slain Sir Gawaine, and by</a>
<a id='line_27371'>misfortune Sir Patrise ate one of those apples, and then suddenly he</a>
<a id='line_27372'>brast. Also there was written upon the tomb that Queen Guenever was</a>
<a id='line_27373'>appealed of treason of the death of Sir Patrise, by Sir Mador de la</a>
<a id='line_27374'>Porte; and there was made mention how Sir Launcelot fought with him for</a>
<a id='line_27375'>Queen Guenever, and overcame him in plain battle. All this was written</a>
<a id='line_27376'>upon the tomb of Sir Patrise in excusing of the queen. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_27377'>Mador sued daily and long, to have the queen’s good grace; and so by</a>
<a id='line_27378'>the means of Sir Launcelot he caused him to stand in the queen’s good</a>
<a id='line_27379'>grace, and all was forgiven.</a>
<a id='line_27380'></a>
<a id='line_27381'>Thus it passed on till our Lady Day, Assumption. Within a fifteen days</a>
<a id='line_27382'>of that feast the king let cry a great jousts and a tournament that</a>
<a id='line_27383'>should be at that day at Camelot, that is Winchester; and the king let</a>
<a id='line_27384'>cry that he and the King of Scots would joust against all that would</a>
<a id='line_27385'>come against them. And when this cry was made, thither came many</a>
<a id='line_27386'>knights. So there came thither the King of Northgalis, and King Anguish</a>
<a id='line_27387'>of Ireland, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_27388'>haut prince, and the King of Northumberland, and many other noble dukes</a>
<a id='line_27389'>and earls of divers countries. So King Arthur made him ready to depart</a>
<a id='line_27390'>to these jousts, and would have had the queen with him, but at that</a>
<a id='line_27391'>time she would not, she said, for she was sick and might not ride at</a>
<a id='line_27392'>that time. That me repenteth, said the king, for this seven year ye saw</a>
<a id='line_27393'>not such a noble fellowship together except at Whitsuntide when Galahad</a>
<a id='line_27394'>departed from the court. Truly, said the queen to the king, ye must</a>
<a id='line_27395'>hold me excused, I may not be there, and that me repenteth. And many</a>
<a id='line_27396'>deemed the queen would not be there because of Sir Launcelot du Lake,</a>
<a id='line_27397'>for Sir Launcelot would not ride with the king, for he said that he was</a>
<a id='line_27398'>not whole of the wound the which Sir Mador had given him; wherefore the</a>
<a id='line_27399'>king was heavy and passing wroth. And so he departed toward Winchester</a>
<a id='line_27400'>with his fellowship; and so by the way the king lodged in a town called</a>
<a id='line_27401'>Astolat, that is now in English called Guildford, and there the king</a>
<a id='line_27402'>lay in the castle.</a>
<a id='line_27403'></a>
<a id='line_27404'>So when the king was departed the queen called Sir Launcelot to her,</a>
<a id='line_27405'>and said thus: Sir Launcelot, ye are greatly to blame thus to hold you</a>
<a id='line_27406'>behind my lord; what, trow ye, what will your enemies and mine say and</a>
<a id='line_27407'>deem? nought else but, See how Sir Launcelot holdeth him ever behind</a>
<a id='line_27408'>the king, and so doth the queen, for that they would have their</a>
<a id='line_27409'>pleasure together. And thus will they say, said the queen to Sir</a>
<a id='line_27410'>Launcelot, have ye no doubt thereof.</a>
<a id='line_27411'></a>
<a id='line_27412'></a>
<a id='line_27413'></a>
<a id='line_27414'></a>
<a id='line_27415'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot rode to Astolat, and received a sleeve to</a>
<a id='line_27416'>wear upon his helm at the request of a maid.</a>
<a id='line_27417'></a>
<a id='line_27418'></a>
<a id='line_27419'>Madam, said Sir Launcelot, I allow your wit, it is of late come since</a>
<a id='line_27420'>ye were wise. And therefore, madam, at this time I will be ruled by</a>
<a id='line_27421'>your counsel, and this night I will take my rest, and to-morrow by time</a>
<a id='line_27422'>I will take my way toward Winchester. But wit you well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27423'>Launcelot to the queen, that at that jousts I will be against the king,</a>
<a id='line_27424'>and against all his fellowship. Ye may there do as ye list, said the</a>
<a id='line_27425'>queen, but by my counsel ye shall not be against your king and your</a>
<a id='line_27426'>fellowship. For therein be full many hard knights of your blood, as ye</a>
<a id='line_27427'>wot well enough, it needeth not to rehearse them. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27428'>Launcelot, I pray you that ye be not displeased with me, for I will</a>
<a id='line_27429'>take the adventure that God will send me.</a>
<a id='line_27430'></a>
<a id='line_27431'>And so upon the morn early Sir Launcelot heard mass and brake his fast,</a>
<a id='line_27432'>and so took his leave of the queen and departed. And then he rode so</a>
<a id='line_27433'>much until he came to Astolat, that is Guildford; and there it happed</a>
<a id='line_27434'>him in the eventide he came to an old baron’s place that hight Sir</a>
<a id='line_27435'>Bernard of Astolat. And as Sir Launcelot entered into his lodging, King</a>
<a id='line_27436'>Arthur espied him as he did walk in a garden beside the castle, how he</a>
<a id='line_27437'>took his lodging, and knew him full well. It is well, said King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_27438'>unto the knights that were with him in that garden beside the castle, I</a>
<a id='line_27439'>have now espied one knight that will play his play at the jousts to the</a>
<a id='line_27440'>which we be gone toward; I undertake he will do marvels. Who is that,</a>
<a id='line_27441'>we pray you tell us? said many knights that were there at that time. Ye</a>
<a id='line_27442'>shall not wit for me, said the king, as at this time. And so the king</a>
<a id='line_27443'>smiled, and went to his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_27444'></a>
<a id='line_27445'>So when Sir Launcelot was in his lodging, and unarmed him in his</a>
<a id='line_27446'>chamber, the old baron and hermit came to him making his reverence, and</a>
<a id='line_27447'>welcomed him in the best manner; but the old knight knew not Sir</a>
<a id='line_27448'>Launcelot. Fair sir, said Sir Launcelot to his host, I would pray you</a>
<a id='line_27449'>to lend me a shield that were not openly known, for mine is well known.</a>
<a id='line_27450'>Sir, said his host, ye shall have your desire, for meseemeth ye be one</a>
<a id='line_27451'>of the likeliest knights of the world, and therefore I shall shew you</a>
<a id='line_27452'>friendship. Sir, wit you well I have two sons that were but late made</a>
<a id='line_27453'>knights, and the eldest hight Sir Tirre, and he was hurt that same day</a>
<a id='line_27454'>he was made knight, that he may not ride, and his shield ye shall have;</a>
<a id='line_27455'>for that is not known I dare say but here, and in no place else. And my</a>
<a id='line_27456'>youngest son hight Lavaine, and if it please you, he shall ride with</a>
<a id='line_27457'>you unto that jousts; and he is of his age strong and wight, for much</a>
<a id='line_27458'>my heart giveth unto you that ye should be a noble knight, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_27459'>pray you, tell me your name, said Sir Bernard. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27460'>Launcelot, ye must hold me excused as at this time, and if God give me</a>
<a id='line_27461'>grace to speed well at the jousts I shall come again and tell you. But</a>
<a id='line_27462'>I pray you, said Sir Launcelot, in any wise let me have your son, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27463'>Lavaine, with me, and that I may have his brother’s shield. All this</a>
<a id='line_27464'>shall be done, said Sir Bernard.</a>
<a id='line_27465'></a>
<a id='line_27466'>This old baron had a daughter that was called that time the Fair Maiden</a>
<a id='line_27467'>of Astolat. And ever she beheld Sir Launcelot wonderfully; and as the</a>
<a id='line_27468'>book saith, she cast such a love unto Sir Launcelot that she could</a>
<a id='line_27469'>never withdraw her love, wherefore she died, and her name was Elaine le</a>
<a id='line_27470'>Blank. So thus as she came to and fro she was so hot in her love that</a>
<a id='line_27471'>she besought Sir Launcelot to wear upon him at the jousts a token of</a>
<a id='line_27472'>hers. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, an if I grant you that, ye may</a>
<a id='line_27473'>say I do more for your love than ever I did for lady or damosel. Then</a>
<a id='line_27474'>he remembered him he would go to the jousts disguised. And because he</a>
<a id='line_27475'>had never fore that time borne no manner of token of no damosel, then</a>
<a id='line_27476'>he bethought him that he would bear one of her, that none of his blood</a>
<a id='line_27477'>thereby might know him, and then he said: Fair maiden, I will grant you</a>
<a id='line_27478'>to wear a token of yours upon mine helmet, and therefore what it is,</a>
<a id='line_27479'>shew it me. Sir, she said, it is a red sleeve of mine, of scarlet, well</a>
<a id='line_27480'>embroidered with great pearls: and so she brought it him. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_27481'>Launcelot received it, and said: Never did I erst so much for no</a>
<a id='line_27482'>damosel. And then Sir Launcelot betook the fair maiden his shield in</a>
<a id='line_27483'>keeping, and prayed her to keep that until that he came again; and so</a>
<a id='line_27484'>that night he had merry rest and great cheer, for ever the damosel</a>
<a id='line_27485'>Elaine was about Sir Launcelot all the while she might be suffered.</a>
<a id='line_27486'></a>
<a id='line_27487'></a>
<a id='line_27488'></a>
<a id='line_27489'></a>
<a id='line_27490'>CHAPTER X. How the tourney began at Winchester, and what knights were</a>
<a id='line_27491'>at the jousts; and other things.</a>
<a id='line_27492'></a>
<a id='line_27493'></a>
<a id='line_27494'>So upon a day, on the morn, King Arthur and all his knights departed,</a>
<a id='line_27495'>for their king had tarried three days to abide his noble knights. And</a>
<a id='line_27496'>so when the king was ridden, Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine made them</a>
<a id='line_27497'>ready to ride, and either of them had white shields, and the red sleeve</a>
<a id='line_27498'>Sir Launcelot let carry with him. And so they took their leave at Sir</a>
<a id='line_27499'>Bernard, the old baron, and at his daughter, the Fair Maiden of</a>
<a id='line_27500'>Astolat. And then they rode so long till that they came to Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_27501'>that time called Winchester; and there was great press of kings, dukes</a>
<a id='line_27502'>earls, and barons, and many noble knights. But there Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_27503'>lodged privily by the means of Sir Lavaine with a rich burgess, that no</a>
<a id='line_27504'>man in that town was ware what they were. And so they reposed them</a>
<a id='line_27505'>there till our Lady Day, Assumption, as the great feast should be. So</a>
<a id='line_27506'>then trumpets blew unto the field, and King Arthur was set on high upon</a>
<a id='line_27507'>a scaffold to behold who did best. But as the French book saith, the</a>
<a id='line_27508'>king would not suffer Sir Gawaine to go from him, for never had Sir</a>
<a id='line_27509'>Gawaine the better an Sir Launcelot were in the field; and many times</a>
<a id='line_27510'>was Sir Gawaine rebuked when Launcelot came into any jousts disguised.</a>
<a id='line_27511'></a>
<a id='line_27512'>Then some of the kings, as King Anguish of Ireland and the King of</a>
<a id='line_27513'>Scots, were that time turned upon the side of King Arthur. And then on</a>
<a id='line_27514'>the other party was the King of Northgalis, and the King with the</a>
<a id='line_27515'>Hundred Knights, and the King of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_27516'>haut prince. But these three kings and this duke were passing weak to</a>
<a id='line_27517'>hold against King Arthur’s party, for with him were the noblest knights</a>
<a id='line_27518'>of the world. So then they withdrew them either party from other, and</a>
<a id='line_27519'>every man made him ready in his best manner to do what he might.</a>
<a id='line_27520'></a>
<a id='line_27521'>Then Sir Launcelot made him ready, and put the red sleeve upon his</a>
<a id='line_27522'>head, and fastened it fast; and so Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_27523'>departed out of Winchester privily, and rode until a little leaved wood</a>
<a id='line_27524'>behind the party that held against King Arthur’s party, and there they</a>
<a id='line_27525'>held them still till the parties smote together. And then came in the</a>
<a id='line_27526'>King of Scots and the King of Ireland on Arthur’s party, and against</a>
<a id='line_27527'>them came the King of Northumberland, and the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_27528'>Knights smote down the King of Northumberland, and the King with the</a>
<a id='line_27529'>Hundred Knights smote down King Anguish of Ireland. Then Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_27530'>that was on Arthur’s party encountered with Sir Galahad, and either of</a>
<a id='line_27531'>them smote down other, and either party halp their lords on horseback</a>
<a id='line_27532'>again. So there began a strong assail upon both parties. And then came</a>
<a id='line_27533'>in Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27534'>Kay le Seneschal, Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Mordred, Sir Meliot</a>
<a id='line_27535'>de Logris, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Safere, Sir Epinogris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27536'>Galleron of Galway. All these fifteen knights were knights of the Table</a>
<a id='line_27537'>Round. So these with more other came in together, and beat aback the</a>
<a id='line_27538'>King of Northumberland and the King of Northgalis. When Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_27539'>saw this, as he hoved in a little leaved wood, then he said unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_27540'>Lavaine: See yonder is a company of good knights, and they hold them</a>
<a id='line_27541'>together as boars that were chafed with dogs. That is truth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27542'>Lavaine.</a>
<a id='line_27543'></a>

<a id='line_27545'></a>
<a id='line_27546'></a>
<a id='line_27547'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine entered in the field</a>
<a id='line_27548'>against them of King Arthur’s court, and how Launcelot was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_27549'></a>
<a id='line_27550'></a>
<a id='line_27551'>Now, said Sir Launcelot, an ye will help me a little, ye shall see</a>
<a id='line_27552'>yonder fellowship that chaseth now these men in our side, that they</a>
<a id='line_27553'>shall go as fast backward as they went forward. Sir, spare not, said</a>
<a id='line_27554'>Sir Lavaine, for I shall do what I may. Then Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_27555'>Lavaine came in at the thickest of the press, and there Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_27556'>smote down Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore, Sir Dodinas, Sir Kay, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27557'>Griflet, and all this he did with one spear; and Sir Lavaine smote down</a>
<a id='line_27558'>Sir Lucan le Butler and Sir Bedevere. And then Sir Launcelot gat</a>
<a id='line_27559'>another spear, and there he smote down Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and</a>
<a id='line_27560'>Sir Mordred, and Sir Meliot de Logris; and Sir Lavaine smote Ozanna le</a>
<a id='line_27561'>Cure Hardy. And then Sir Launcelot drew his sword, and there he smote</a>
<a id='line_27562'>on the right hand and on the left hand, and by great force he unhorsed</a>
<a id='line_27563'>Sir Safere, Sir Epinogris, and Sir Galleron; and then the knights of</a>
<a id='line_27564'>the Table Round withdrew them aback, after they had gotten their horses</a>
<a id='line_27565'>as well as they might. O mercy Jesu, said Sir Gawaine, what knight is</a>
<a id='line_27566'>yonder that doth so marvellous deeds of arms in that field? I wot well</a>
<a id='line_27567'>what he is, said King Arthur, but as at this time I will not name him.</a>
<a id='line_27568'>Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I would say it were Sir Launcelot by his riding</a>
<a id='line_27569'>and his buffets that I see him deal, but ever meseemeth it should not</a>
<a id='line_27570'>be he, for that he beareth the red sleeve upon his head; for I wist him</a>
<a id='line_27571'>never bear token at no jousts, of lady nor gentlewoman. Let him be,</a>
<a id='line_27572'>said King Arthur, he will be better known, and do more, or ever he</a>
<a id='line_27573'>depart.</a>
<a id='line_27574'></a>
<a id='line_27575'>Then the party that was against King Arthur were well comforted, and</a>
<a id='line_27576'>then they held them together that beforehand were sore rebuked. Then</a>
<a id='line_27577'>Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel called unto them the</a>
<a id='line_27578'>knights of their blood, as Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27579'>Aliduke, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Bellangere le Beuse. So these</a>
<a id='line_27580'>nine knights of Sir Launcelot’s kin thrust in mightily, for they were</a>
<a id='line_27581'>all noble knights; and they, of great hate and despite that they had</a>
<a id='line_27582'>unto him, thought to rebuke that noble knight Sir Launcelot, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_27583'>Lavaine, for they knew them not; and so they came hurling together, and</a>
<a id='line_27584'>smote down many knights of Northgalis and of Northumberland. And when</a>
<a id='line_27585'>Sir Launcelot saw them fare so, he gat a spear in his hand; and there</a>
<a id='line_27586'>encountered with him all at once Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and Sir Lionel,</a>
<a id='line_27587'>and all they three smote him at once with their spears. And with force</a>
<a id='line_27588'>of themself they smote Sir Launcelot’s horse to the earth; and by</a>
<a id='line_27589'>misfortune Sir Bors smote Sir Launcelot through the shield into the</a>
<a id='line_27590'>side, and the spear brake, and the head left still in his side.</a>
<a id='line_27591'></a>
<a id='line_27592'>When Sir Lavaine saw his master lie on the ground, he ran to the King</a>
<a id='line_27593'>of Scots and smote him to the earth; and by great force he took his</a>
<a id='line_27594'>horse, and brought him to Sir Launcelot, and maugre of them all he made</a>
<a id='line_27595'>him to mount upon that horse. And then Launcelot gat a spear in his</a>
<a id='line_27596'>hand, and there he smote Sir Bors, horse and man, to the earth. In the</a>
<a id='line_27597'>same wise he served Sir Ector and Sir Lionel; and Sir Lavaine smote</a>
<a id='line_27598'>down Sir Blamore de Ganis. And then Sir Launcelot drew his sword, for</a>
<a id='line_27599'>he felt himself so sore y-hurt that he weened there to have had his</a>
<a id='line_27600'>death. And then he smote Sir Bleoberis such a buffet on the helm that</a>
<a id='line_27601'>he fell down to the earth in a swoon. And in the same wise he served</a>
<a id='line_27602'>Sir Aliduke and Sir Galihud. And Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Bellangere,</a>
<a id='line_27603'>that was the son of Alisander le Orphelin.</a>
<a id='line_27604'></a>
<a id='line_27605'>And by this was Sir Bors horsed, and then he came with Sir Ector and</a>
<a id='line_27606'>Sir Lionel, and all they three smote with swords upon Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_27607'>helmet. And when he felt their buffets and his wound, the which was so</a>
<a id='line_27608'>grievous, then he thought to do what he might while he might endure.</a>
<a id='line_27609'>And then he gave Sir Bors such a buffet that he made him bow his head</a>
<a id='line_27610'>passing low; and therewithal he raced off his helm, and might have</a>
<a id='line_27611'>slain him; and so pulled him down, and in the same wise he served Sir</a>
<a id='line_27612'>Ector and Sir Lionel. For as the book saith he might have slain them,</a>
<a id='line_27613'>but when he saw their visages his heart might not serve him thereto,</a>
<a id='line_27614'>but left them there. And then afterward he hurled into the thickest</a>
<a id='line_27615'>press of them all, and did there the marvelloust deeds of arms that</a>
<a id='line_27616'>ever man saw or heard speak of, and ever Sir Lavaine, the good knight,</a>
<a id='line_27617'>with him. And there Sir Launcelot with his sword smote down and pulled</a>
<a id='line_27618'>down, as the French book maketh mention, mo than thirty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_27619'>the most part were of the Table Round; and Sir Lavaine did full well</a>
<a id='line_27620'>that day, for he smote down ten knights of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_27621'></a>
<a id='line_27622'></a>
<a id='line_27623'></a>
<a id='line_27624'></a>
<a id='line_27625'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed out of the</a>
<a id='line_27626'>field, and in what jeopardy Launcelot was.</a>
<a id='line_27627'></a>
<a id='line_27628'></a>
<a id='line_27629'>Mercy Jesu, said Sir Gawaine to Arthur, I marvel what knight that he is</a>
<a id='line_27630'>with the red sleeve. Sir, said King Arthur, he will be known or he</a>
<a id='line_27631'>depart. And then the king blew unto lodging, and the prize was given by</a>
<a id='line_27632'>heralds unto the knight with the white shield that bare the red sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_27633'>Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, the King of Northgalis,</a>
<a id='line_27634'>and the King of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince, and</a>
<a id='line_27635'>said unto Sir Launcelot: Fair knight, God thee bless, for much have ye</a>
<a id='line_27636'>done this day for us, therefore we pray you that ye will come with us</a>
<a id='line_27637'>that ye may receive the honour and the prize as ye have worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_27638'>deserved it. My fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well if I have</a>
<a id='line_27639'>deserved thanks I have sore bought it, and that me repenteth, for I am</a>
<a id='line_27640'>like never to escape with my life; therefore, fair lords, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_27641'>that ye will suffer me to depart where me liketh, for I am sore hurt. I</a>
<a id='line_27642'>take none force of none honour, for I had liefer to repose me than to</a>
<a id='line_27643'>be lord of all the world. And therewithal he groaned piteously, and</a>
<a id='line_27644'>rode a great wallop away-ward from them until he came under a wood’s</a>
<a id='line_27645'>side.</a>
<a id='line_27646'></a>
<a id='line_27647'>And when he saw that he was from the field nigh a mile, that he was</a>
<a id='line_27648'>sure he might not be seen, then he said with an high voice: O gentle</a>
<a id='line_27649'>knight, Sir Lavaine, help me that this truncheon were out of my side,</a>
<a id='line_27650'>for it sticketh so sore that it nigh slayeth me. O mine own lord, said</a>
<a id='line_27651'>Sir Lavaine, I would fain do that might please you, but I dread me sore</a>
<a id='line_27652'>an I pull out the truncheon that ye shall be in peril of death. I</a>
<a id='line_27653'>charge you, said Sir Launcelot, as ye love me, draw it out. And</a>
<a id='line_27654'>therewithal he descended from his horse, and right so did Sir Lavaine;</a>
<a id='line_27655'>and forthwithal Sir Lavaine drew the truncheon out of his side, and he</a>
<a id='line_27656'>gave a great shriek and a marvellous grisly groan, and the blood brast</a>
<a id='line_27657'>out nigh a pint at once, that at the last he sank down upon his</a>
<a id='line_27658'>buttocks, and so swooned pale and deadly. Alas, said Sir Lavaine, what</a>
<a id='line_27659'>shall I do? And then he turned Sir Launcelot into the wind, but so he</a>
<a id='line_27660'>lay there nigh half an hour as he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_27661'></a>
<a id='line_27662'>And so at the last Sir Launcelot cast up his eyes, and said: O Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_27663'>help me that I were on my horse, for here is fast by within this two</a>
<a id='line_27664'>mile a gentle hermit that sometime was a full noble knight and a great</a>
<a id='line_27665'>lord of possessions. And for great goodness he hath taken him to wilful</a>
<a id='line_27666'>poverty, and forsaken many lands, and his name is Sir Baudwin of</a>
<a id='line_27667'>Brittany, and he is a full noble surgeon and a good leech. Now let see,</a>
<a id='line_27668'>help me up that I were there, for ever my heart giveth me that I shall</a>
<a id='line_27669'>never die of my cousin-germain’s hands. And then with great pain Sir</a>
<a id='line_27670'>Lavaine halp him upon his horse. And then they rode a great wallop</a>
<a id='line_27671'>together, and ever Sir Launcelot bled that it ran down to the earth;</a>
<a id='line_27672'>and so by fortune they came to that hermitage the which was under a</a>
<a id='line_27673'>wood, and a great cliff on the other side, and a fair water running</a>
<a id='line_27674'>under it. And then Sir Lavaine beat on the gate with the butt of his</a>
<a id='line_27675'>spear, and cried fast: Let in for Jesu’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_27676'></a>
<a id='line_27677'>And there came a fair child to them, and asked them what they would.</a>
<a id='line_27678'>Fair son, said Sir Lavaine, go and pray thy lord, the hermit, for God’s</a>
<a id='line_27679'>sake to let in here a knight that is full sore wounded; and this day</a>
<a id='line_27680'>tell thy lord I saw him do more deeds of arms than ever I heard say</a>
<a id='line_27681'>that any man did. So the child went in lightly, and then he brought the</a>
<a id='line_27682'>hermit, the which was a passing good man. When Sir Lavaine saw him he</a>
<a id='line_27683'>prayed him for God’s sake of succour. What knight is he? said the</a>
<a id='line_27684'>hermit. Is he of the house of King Arthur, or not? I wot not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27685'>Lavaine, what is he, nor what is his name, but well I wot I saw him do</a>
<a id='line_27686'>marvellously this day as of deeds of arms. On whose party was he? said</a>
<a id='line_27687'>the hermit. Sir, said Sir Lavaine, he was this day against King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_27688'>and there he won the prize of all the knights of the Round Table. I</a>
<a id='line_27689'>have seen the day, said the hermit, I would have loved him the worse</a>
<a id='line_27690'>because he was against my lord, King Arthur, for sometime I was one of</a>
<a id='line_27691'>the fellowship of the Round Table, but I thank God now I am otherwise</a>
<a id='line_27692'>disposed. But where is he? let me see him. Then Sir Lavaine brought the</a>
<a id='line_27693'>hermit to him.</a>
<a id='line_27694'></a>
<a id='line_27695'></a>
<a id='line_27696'></a>
<a id='line_27697'></a>
<a id='line_27698'>CHAPTER XIII. How Launcelot was brought to an hermit for to be healed</a>
<a id='line_27699'>of his wound, and of other matters.</a>
<a id='line_27700'></a>
<a id='line_27701'></a>
<a id='line_27702'>And when the hermit beheld him, as he sat leaning upon his saddle-bow</a>
<a id='line_27703'>ever bleeding piteously, and ever the knight-hermit thought that he</a>
<a id='line_27704'>should know him, but he could not bring him to knowledge because he was</a>
<a id='line_27705'>so pale for bleeding. What knight are ye, said the hermit, and where</a>
<a id='line_27706'>were ye born? My fair lord, said Sir Launcelot, I am a stranger and a</a>
<a id='line_27707'>knight adventurous, that laboureth throughout many realms for to win</a>
<a id='line_27708'>worship. Then the hermit advised him better, and saw by a wound on his</a>
<a id='line_27709'>cheek that he was Sir Launcelot. Alas, said the hermit, mine own lord</a>
<a id='line_27710'>why lain you your name from me? Forsooth I ought to know you of right,</a>
<a id='line_27711'>for ye are the most noblest knight of the world, for well I know you</a>
<a id='line_27712'>for Sir Launcelot. Sir, said he, sith ye know me, help me an ye may,</a>
<a id='line_27713'>for God’s sake, for I would be out of this pain at once, either to</a>
<a id='line_27714'>death or to life. Have ye no doubt, said the hermit, ye shall live and</a>
<a id='line_27715'>fare right well. And so the hermit called to him two of his servants,</a>
<a id='line_27716'>and so he and his servants bare him into the hermitage, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_27717'>unarmed him, and laid him in his bed. And then anon the hermit</a>
<a id='line_27718'>staunched his blood, and made him to drink good wine, so that Sir</a>
<a id='line_27719'>Launcelot was well refreshed and knew himself; for in those days it was</a>
<a id='line_27720'>not the guise of hermits as is nowadays, for there were none hermits in</a>
<a id='line_27721'>those days but that they had been men of worship and of prowess; and</a>
<a id='line_27722'>those hermits held great household, and refreshed people that were in</a>
<a id='line_27723'>distress.</a>
<a id='line_27724'></a>
<a id='line_27725'>Now turn we unto King Arthur, and leave we Sir Launcelot in the</a>
<a id='line_27726'>hermitage. So when the kings were come together on both parties, and</a>
<a id='line_27727'>the great feast should be holden, King Arthur asked the King of</a>
<a id='line_27728'>Northgalis and their fellowship, where was that knight that bare the</a>
<a id='line_27729'>red sleeve: Bring him afore me that he may have his laud, and honour,</a>
<a id='line_27730'>and the prize, as it is right. Then spake Sir Galahad, the haut prince,</a>
<a id='line_27731'>and the King with the Hundred Knights: We suppose that knight is</a>
<a id='line_27732'>mischieved, and that he is never like to see you nor none of us all,</a>
<a id='line_27733'>and that is the greatest pity that ever we wist of any knight. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_27734'>said Arthur, how may this be, is he so hurt? What is his name? said</a>
<a id='line_27735'>King Arthur. Truly, said they all, we know not his name, nor from</a>
<a id='line_27736'>whence he came, nor whither he would. Alas, said the king, this be to</a>
<a id='line_27737'>me the worst tidings that came to me this seven year, for I would not</a>
<a id='line_27738'>for all the lands I wield to know and wit it were so that that noble</a>
<a id='line_27739'>knight were slain. Know ye him? said they all. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_27740'>Arthur, whether I know him or know him not, ye shall not know for me</a>
<a id='line_27741'>what man he is, but Almighty Jesu send me good tidings of him. And so</a>
<a id='line_27742'>said they all. By my head, said Sir Gawaine, if it so be that the good</a>
<a id='line_27743'>knight be so sore hurt, it is great damage and pity to all this land,</a>
<a id='line_27744'>for he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw in a field handle</a>
<a id='line_27745'>a spear or a sword; and if he may be found I shall find him, for I am</a>
<a id='line_27746'>sure he nis not far from this town. Bear you well, said King Arthur, an</a>
<a id='line_27747'>ye may find him, unless that he be in such a plight that he may not</a>
<a id='line_27748'>wield himself. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine, but wit I shall what he</a>
<a id='line_27749'>is, an I may find him.</a>
<a id='line_27750'></a>
<a id='line_27751'>Right so Sir Gawaine took a squire with him upon hackneys, and rode all</a>
<a id='line_27752'>about Camelot within six or seven mile, but so he came again and could</a>
<a id='line_27753'>hear no word of him. Then within two days King Arthur and all the</a>
<a id='line_27754'>fellowship returned unto London again. And so as they rode by the way</a>
<a id='line_27755'>it happed Sir Gawaine at Astolat to lodge with Sir Bernard thereas was</a>
<a id='line_27756'>Sir Launcelot lodged. And so as Sir Gawaine was in his chamber to</a>
<a id='line_27757'>repose him Sir Bernard, the old baron, came unto him, and his daughter</a>
<a id='line_27758'>Elaine, to cheer him and to ask him what tidings, and who did best at</a>
<a id='line_27759'>that tournament of Winchester. So God me help, said Sir Gawaine, there</a>
<a id='line_27760'>were two knights that bare two white shields, but the one of them bare</a>
<a id='line_27761'>a red sleeve upon his head, and certainly he was one of the best</a>
<a id='line_27762'>knights that ever I saw joust in field. For I dare say, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27763'>Gawaine, that one knight with the red sleeve smote down forty knights</a>
<a id='line_27764'>of the Table Round, and his fellow did right well and worshipfully. Now</a>
<a id='line_27765'>blessed be God, said the Fair Maiden of Astolat, that that knight sped</a>
<a id='line_27766'>so well, for he is the man in the world that I first loved, and truly</a>
<a id='line_27767'>he shall be last that ever I shall love. Now, fair maid, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27768'>Gawaine, is that good knight your love? Certainly sir, said she, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_27769'>well he is my love. Then know ye his name? said Sir Gawaine. Nay truly,</a>
<a id='line_27770'>said the damosel, I know not his name nor from whence he cometh, but to</a>
<a id='line_27771'>say that I love him, I promise you and God that I love him. How had ye</a>
<a id='line_27772'>knowledge of him first? said Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_27773'></a>
<a id='line_27774'></a>
<a id='line_27775'></a>
<a id='line_27776'></a>
<a id='line_27777'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Gawaine was lodged with the lord of Astolat, and</a>
<a id='line_27778'>there had knowledge that it was Sir Launcelot that bare the red sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_27779'></a>
<a id='line_27780'></a>
<a id='line_27781'>Then she told him as ye have heard to-fore, and how her father betook</a>
<a id='line_27782'>him her brother to do him service, and how her father lent him her</a>
<a id='line_27783'>brother’s, Sir Tirre’s, shield: And here with me he left his own</a>
<a id='line_27784'>shield. For what cause did he so? said Sir Gawaine. For this cause,</a>
<a id='line_27785'>said the damosel, for his shield was too well known among many noble</a>
<a id='line_27786'>knights. Ah fair damosel, said Sir Gawaine, please it you let me have a</a>
<a id='line_27787'>sight of that shield. Sir, said she, it is in my chamber, covered with</a>
<a id='line_27788'>a case, and if ye will come with me ye shall see it. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27789'>Bernard till his daughter, let send for it.</a>
<a id='line_27790'></a>
<a id='line_27791'>So when the shield was come, Sir Gawaine took off the case, and when he</a>
<a id='line_27792'>beheld that shield he knew anon that it was Sir Launcelot’s shield, and</a>
<a id='line_27793'>his own arms. Ah Jesu mercy, said Sir Gawaine, now is my heart more</a>
<a id='line_27794'>heavier than ever it was to-fore. Why? said Elaine. For I have great</a>
<a id='line_27795'>cause, said Sir Gawaine. Is that knight that oweth this shield your</a>
<a id='line_27796'>love? Yea truly, said she, my love he is, God would I were his love. So</a>
<a id='line_27797'>God me speed, said Sir Gawaine, fair damosel ye have right, for an he</a>
<a id='line_27798'>be your love ye love the most honourable knight of the world, and the</a>
<a id='line_27799'>man of most worship. So me thought ever, said the damosel, for never or</a>
<a id='line_27800'>that time, for no knight that ever I saw, loved I never none erst. God</a>
<a id='line_27801'>grant, said Sir Gawaine, that either of you may rejoice other, but that</a>
<a id='line_27802'>is in a great adventure. But truly, said Sir Gawaine unto the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_27803'>ye may say ye have a fair grace, for why I have known that noble knight</a>
<a id='line_27804'>this four-and-twenty year, and never or that day, I nor none other</a>
<a id='line_27805'>knight, I dare make good, saw nor heard say that ever he bare token or</a>
<a id='line_27806'>sign of no lady, gentlewoman, ne maiden, at no jousts nor tournament.</a>
<a id='line_27807'>And therefore fair maiden, said Sir Gawaine, ye are much beholden to</a>
<a id='line_27808'>him to give him thanks. But I dread me, said Sir Gawaine, that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_27809'>never see him in this world, and that is great pity that ever was of</a>
<a id='line_27810'>earthly knight. Alas, said she, how may this be, is he slain? I say not</a>
<a id='line_27811'>so, said Sir Gawaine, but wit ye well he is grievously wounded, by all</a>
<a id='line_27812'>manner of signs, and by men’s sight more likelier to be dead than to be</a>
<a id='line_27813'>alive; and wit ye well he is the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, for by</a>
<a id='line_27814'>this shield I know him. Alas, said the Fair Maiden of Astolat, how may</a>
<a id='line_27815'>this be, and what was his hurt? Truly, said Sir Gawaine, the man in the</a>
<a id='line_27816'>world that loved him best hurt him so; and I dare say, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27817'>Gawaine, an that knight that hurt him knew the very certainty that he</a>
<a id='line_27818'>had hurt Sir Launcelot, it would be the most sorrow that ever came to</a>
<a id='line_27819'>his heart.</a>
<a id='line_27820'></a>
<a id='line_27821'>Now fair father, said then Elaine, I require you give me leave to ride</a>
<a id='line_27822'>and to seek him, or else I wot well I shall go out of my mind, for I</a>
<a id='line_27823'>shall never stint till that I find him and my brother, Sir Lavaine. Do</a>
<a id='line_27824'>as it liketh you, said her father, for me sore repenteth of the hurt of</a>
<a id='line_27825'>that noble knight. Right so the maid made her ready, and before Sir</a>
<a id='line_27826'>Gawaine, making great dole.</a>
<a id='line_27827'></a>
<a id='line_27828'>Then on the morn Sir Gawaine came to King Arthur, and told him how he</a>
<a id='line_27829'>had found Sir Launcelot’s shield in the keeping of the Fair Maiden of</a>
<a id='line_27830'>Astolat. All that knew I aforehand, said King Arthur, and that caused</a>
<a id='line_27831'>me I would not suffer you to have ado at the great jousts, for I</a>
<a id='line_27832'>espied, said King Arthur, when he came in till his lodging full late in</a>
<a id='line_27833'>the evening in Astolat. But marvel have I, said Arthur, that ever he</a>
<a id='line_27834'>would bear any sign of any damosel, for or now I never heard say nor</a>
<a id='line_27835'>knew that ever he bare any token of none earthly woman. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_27836'>said Sir Gawaine, the Fair Maiden of Astolat loveth him marvellously</a>
<a id='line_27837'>well; what it meaneth I cannot say, and she is ridden after to seek</a>
<a id='line_27838'>him. So the king and all came to London, and there Sir Gawaine openly</a>
<a id='line_27839'>disclosed to all the court that it was Sir Launcelot that jousted best.</a>
<a id='line_27840'></a>
<a id='line_27841'></a>
<a id='line_27842'></a>
<a id='line_27843'></a>
<a id='line_27844'>CHAPTER XV. Of the sorrow that Sir Bors had for the hurt of Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_27845'>and of the anger that the queen had because Launcelot bare the sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_27846'></a>
<a id='line_27847'></a>
<a id='line_27848'>And when Sir Bors heard that, wit ye well he was an heavy man, and so</a>
<a id='line_27849'>were all his kinsmen. But when Queen Guenever wist that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_27850'>bare the red sleeve of the Fair Maiden of Astolat she was nigh out of</a>
<a id='line_27851'>her mind for wrath. And then she sent for Sir Bors de Ganis in all the</a>
<a id='line_27852'>haste that might be. So when Sir Bors was come to-fore the queen, then</a>
<a id='line_27853'>she said: Ah Sir Bors, have ye heard say how falsely Sir Launcelot hath</a>
<a id='line_27854'>betrayed me? Alas madam, said Sir Bors, I am afeard he hath betrayed</a>
<a id='line_27855'>himself and us all. No force, said the queen, though he be destroyed,</a>
<a id='line_27856'>for he is a false traitor-knight. Madam, said Sir Bors, I pray you say</a>
<a id='line_27857'>ye not so, for wit you well I may not hear such language of him. Why</a>
<a id='line_27858'>Sir Bors, said she, should I not call him traitor when he bare the red</a>
<a id='line_27859'>sleeve upon his head at Winchester, at the great jousts? Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_27860'>Sir Bors, that sleeve-bearing repenteth me sore, but I dare say he did</a>
<a id='line_27861'>it to none evil intent, but for this cause he bare the red sleeve that</a>
<a id='line_27862'>none of his blood should know him. For or then we, nor none of us all,</a>
<a id='line_27863'>never knew that ever he bare token or sign of maid, lady, ne</a>
<a id='line_27864'>gentlewoman. Fie on him, said the queen, yet for all his pride and</a>
<a id='line_27865'>bobaunce there ye proved yourself his better. Nay madam, say ye never</a>
<a id='line_27866'>more so, for he beat me and my fellows, and might have slain us an he</a>
<a id='line_27867'>had would. Fie on him, said the queen, for I heard Sir Gawaine say</a>
<a id='line_27868'>before my lord Arthur that it were marvel to tell the great love that</a>
<a id='line_27869'>is between the Fair Maiden of Astolat and him. Madam, said Sir Bors, I</a>
<a id='line_27870'>may not warn Sir Gawaine to say what it pleased him; but I dare say, as</a>
<a id='line_27871'>for my lord, Sir Launcelot, that he loveth no lady, gentlewoman, nor</a>
<a id='line_27872'>maid, but all he loveth in like much. And therefore madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27873'>Bors, ye may say what ye will, but wit ye well I will haste me to seek</a>
<a id='line_27874'>him, and find him wheresomever he be, and God send me good tidings of</a>
<a id='line_27875'>him. And so leave we them there, and speak we of Sir Launcelot that lay</a>
<a id='line_27876'>in great peril.</a>
<a id='line_27877'></a>
<a id='line_27878'>So as fair Elaine came to Winchester she sought there all about, and by</a>
<a id='line_27879'>fortune Sir Lavaine was ridden to play him, to enchafe his horse. And</a>
<a id='line_27880'>anon as Elaine saw him she knew him, and then she cried aloud until</a>
<a id='line_27881'>him. And when he heard her anon he came to her, and then she asked her</a>
<a id='line_27882'>brother how did my lord, Sir Launcelot. Who told you, sister, that my</a>
<a id='line_27883'>lord’s name was Sir Launcelot? Then she told him how Sir Gawaine by his</a>
<a id='line_27884'>shield knew him. So they rode together till that they came to the</a>
<a id='line_27885'>hermitage, and anon she alighted.</a>
<a id='line_27886'></a>
<a id='line_27887'>So Sir Lavaine brought her in to Sir Launcelot; and when she saw him</a>
<a id='line_27888'>lie so sick and pale in his bed she might not speak, but suddenly she</a>
<a id='line_27889'>fell to the earth down suddenly in a swoon, and there she lay a great</a>
<a id='line_27890'>while. And when she was relieved, she shrieked and said: My lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_27891'>Launcelot, alas why be ye in this plight? and then she swooned again.</a>
<a id='line_27892'>And then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Lavaine to take her up: And bring her</a>
<a id='line_27893'>to me. And when she came to herself Sir Launcelot kissed her, and said:</a>
<a id='line_27894'>Fair maiden, why fare ye thus? ye put me to pain; wherefore make ye no</a>
<a id='line_27895'>more such cheer, for an ye be come to comfort me ye be right welcome;</a>
<a id='line_27896'>and of this little hurt that I have I shall be right hastily whole by</a>
<a id='line_27897'>the grace of God. But I marvel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my</a>
<a id='line_27898'>name? Then the fair maiden told him all how Sir Gawaine was lodged with</a>
<a id='line_27899'>her father: And there by your shield he discovered your name. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_27900'>said Sir Launcelot, that me repenteth that my name is known, for I am</a>
<a id='line_27901'>sure it will turn unto anger. And then Sir Launcelot compassed in his</a>
<a id='line_27902'>mind that Sir Gawaine would tell Queen Guenever how he bare the red</a>
<a id='line_27903'>sleeve, and for whom; that he wist well would turn into great anger.</a>
<a id='line_27904'></a>
<a id='line_27905'>So this maiden Elaine never went from Sir Launcelot, but watched him</a>
<a id='line_27906'>day and night, and did such attendance to him, that the French book</a>
<a id='line_27907'>saith there was never woman did more kindlier for man than she. Then</a>
<a id='line_27908'>Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Lavaine to make aspies in Winchester for Sir</a>
<a id='line_27909'>Bors if he came there, and told him by what tokens he should know him,</a>
<a id='line_27910'>by a wound in his forehead. For well I am sure, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_27911'>that Sir Bors will seek me, for he is the same good knight that hurt</a>
<a id='line_27912'>me.</a>
<a id='line_27913'></a>
<a id='line_27914'></a>
<a id='line_27915'></a>
<a id='line_27916'></a>
<a id='line_27917'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Bors sought Launcelot and found him in the</a>
<a id='line_27918'>hermitage, and of the lamentation between them.</a>
<a id='line_27919'></a>
<a id='line_27920'></a>
<a id='line_27921'>Now turn we unto Sir Bors de Ganis that came unto Winchester to seek</a>
<a id='line_27922'>after his cousin Sir Launcelot. And so when he came to Winchester, anon</a>
<a id='line_27923'>there were men that Sir Lavaine had made to lie in a watch for such a</a>
<a id='line_27924'>man, and anon Sir Lavaine had warning; and then Sir Lavaine came to</a>
<a id='line_27925'>Winchester and found Sir Bors, and there he told him what he was, and</a>
<a id='line_27926'>with whom he was, and what was his name. Now fair knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27927'>Bors, I require you that ye will bring me to my lord, Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_27928'>Sir, said Sir Lavaine, take your horse, and within this hour ye shall</a>
<a id='line_27929'>see him. And so they departed, and came to the hermitage.</a>
<a id='line_27930'></a>
<a id='line_27931'>And when Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot lie in his bed pale and</a>
<a id='line_27932'>discoloured, anon Sir Bors lost his countenance, and for kindness and</a>
<a id='line_27933'>pity he might not speak, but wept tenderly a great while. And then when</a>
<a id='line_27934'>he might speak he said thus: O my lord, Sir Launcelot, God you bless,</a>
<a id='line_27935'>and send you hasty recover; and full heavy am I of my misfortune and of</a>
<a id='line_27936'>mine unhappiness, for now I may call myself unhappy. And I dread me</a>
<a id='line_27937'>that God is greatly displeased with me, that he would suffer me to have</a>
<a id='line_27938'>such a shame for to hurt you that are all our leader, and all our</a>
<a id='line_27939'>worship; and therefore I call myself unhappy. Alas that ever such a</a>
<a id='line_27940'>caitiff-knight as I am should have power by unhappiness to hurt the</a>
<a id='line_27941'>most noblest knight of the world. Where I so shamefully set upon you</a>
<a id='line_27942'>and overcharged you, and where ye might have slain me, ye saved me; and</a>
<a id='line_27943'>so did not I, for I and your blood did to you our utterance. I marvel,</a>
<a id='line_27944'>said Sir Bors, that my heart or my blood would serve me, wherefore my</a>
<a id='line_27945'>lord, Sir Launcelot, I ask your mercy. Fair cousin, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_27946'>ye be right welcome; and wit ye well, overmuch ye say for to please me,</a>
<a id='line_27947'>the which pleaseth me not, for why I have the same I sought; for I</a>
<a id='line_27948'>would with pride have overcome you all, and there in my pride I was</a>
<a id='line_27949'>near slain, and that was in mine own default, for I might have given</a>
<a id='line_27950'>you warning of my being there. And then had I had no hurt, for it is an</a>
<a id='line_27951'>old said saw, there is hard battle thereas kin and friends do battle</a>
<a id='line_27952'>either against other, there may be no mercy but mortal war. Therefore,</a>
<a id='line_27953'>fair cousin, said Sir Launcelot, let this speech overpass, and all</a>
<a id='line_27954'>shall be welcome that God sendeth; and let us leave off this matter and</a>
<a id='line_27955'>let us speak of some rejoicing, for this that is done may not be</a>
<a id='line_27956'>undone; and let us find a remedy how soon that I may be whole.</a>
<a id='line_27957'></a>
<a id='line_27958'>Then Sir Bors leaned upon his bedside, and told Sir Launcelot how the</a>
<a id='line_27959'>queen was passing wroth with him, because he wore the red sleeve at the</a>
<a id='line_27960'>great jousts; and there Sir Bors told him all how Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_27961'>discovered it: By your shield that ye left with the Fair Maiden of</a>
<a id='line_27962'>Astolat. Then is the queen wroth, said Sir Launcelot and therefore am I</a>
<a id='line_27963'>right heavy, for I deserved no wrath, for all that I did was because I</a>
<a id='line_27964'>would not be known. Right so excused I you, said Sir Bors, but all was</a>
<a id='line_27965'>in vain, for she said more largelier to me than I to you now. But is</a>
<a id='line_27966'>this she, said Sir Bors, that is so busy about you, that men call the</a>
<a id='line_27967'>Fair Maiden of Astolat? She it is, said Sir Launcelot, that by no means</a>
<a id='line_27968'>I cannot put her from me. Why should ye put her from you? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27969'>Bors, she is a passing fair damosel, and a well beseen, and well</a>
<a id='line_27970'>taught; and God would, fair cousin, said Sir Bors, that ye could love</a>
<a id='line_27971'>her, but as to that I may not, nor I dare not, counsel you. But I see</a>
<a id='line_27972'>well, said Sir Bors, by her diligence about you that she loveth you</a>
<a id='line_27973'>entirely. That me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_27974'>she is not the first that hath lost her pain upon you, and that is the</a>
<a id='line_27975'>more pity: and so they talked of many more things. And so within three</a>
<a id='line_27976'>days or four Sir Launcelot was big and strong again.</a>
<a id='line_27977'></a>
<a id='line_27978'></a>
<a id='line_27979'></a>
<a id='line_27980'></a>
<a id='line_27981'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot armed him to assay if he might bear</a>
<a id='line_27982'>arms, and how his wounds brast out again.</a>
<a id='line_27983'></a>
<a id='line_27984'></a>
<a id='line_27985'>Then Sir Bors told Sir Launcelot how there was sworn a great tournament</a>
<a id='line_27986'>and jousts betwixt King Arthur and the King of Northgalis, that should</a>
<a id='line_27987'>be upon All Hallowmass Day, beside Winchester. Is that truth? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_27988'>Launcelot; then shall ye abide with me still a little while until that</a>
<a id='line_27989'>I be whole, for I feel myself right big and strong. Blessed be God,</a>
<a id='line_27990'>said Sir Bors. Then were they there nigh a month together, and ever</a>
<a id='line_27991'>this maiden Elaine did ever her diligent labour night and day unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_27992'>Launcelot, that there was never child nor wife more meeker to her</a>
<a id='line_27993'>father and husband than was that Fair Maiden of Astolat; wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_27994'>Bors was greatly pleased with her.</a>
<a id='line_27995'></a>
<a id='line_27996'>So upon a day, by the assent of Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_27997'>Lavaine, they made the hermit to seek in woods for divers herbs, and so</a>
<a id='line_27998'>Sir Launcelot made fair Elaine to gather herbs for him to make him a</a>
<a id='line_27999'>bain. In the meanwhile Sir Launcelot made him to arm him at all pieces;</a>
<a id='line_28000'>and there he thought to assay his armour and his spear, for his hurt or</a>
<a id='line_28001'>not. And so when he was upon his horse he stirred him fiercely, and the</a>
<a id='line_28002'>horse was passing lusty and fresh because he was not laboured a month</a>
<a id='line_28003'>afore. And then Sir Launcelot couched that spear in the rest. That</a>
<a id='line_28004'>courser leapt mightily when he felt the spurs; and he that was upon</a>
<a id='line_28005'>him, the which was the noblest horse of the world, strained him</a>
<a id='line_28006'>mightily and stably, and kept still the spear in the rest; and</a>
<a id='line_28007'>therewith Sir Launcelot strained himself so straitly, with so great</a>
<a id='line_28008'>force, to get the horse forward, that the button of his wound brast</a>
<a id='line_28009'>both within and without; and therewithal the blood came out so fiercely</a>
<a id='line_28010'>that he felt himself so feeble that he might not sit upon his horse.</a>
<a id='line_28011'>And then Sir Launcelot cried unto Sir Bors: Ah, Sir Bors and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28012'>Lavaine, help, for I am come to mine end. And therewith he fell down on</a>
<a id='line_28013'>the one side to the earth like a dead corpse. And then Sir Bors and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28014'>Lavaine came to him with sorrow-making out of measure. And so by</a>
<a id='line_28015'>fortune the maiden Elaine heard their mourning, and then she came</a>
<a id='line_28016'>thither; and when she found Sir Launcelot there armed in that place she</a>
<a id='line_28017'>cried and wept as she had been wood; and then she kissed him, and did</a>
<a id='line_28018'>what she might to awake him. And then she rebuked her brother and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28019'>Bors, and called them false traitors, why they would take him out of</a>
<a id='line_28020'>his bed; there she cried, and said she would appeal them of his death.</a>
<a id='line_28021'></a>
<a id='line_28022'>With this came the holy hermit, Sir Baudwin of Brittany, and when he</a>
<a id='line_28023'>found Sir Launcelot in that plight he said but little, but wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_28024'>he was wroth; and then he bade them: Let us have him in. And so they</a>
<a id='line_28025'>all bare him unto the hermitage, and unarmed him, and laid him in his</a>
<a id='line_28026'>bed; and evermore his wound bled piteously, but he stirred no limb of</a>
<a id='line_28027'>him. Then the knight-hermit put a thing in his nose and a little deal</a>
<a id='line_28028'>of water in his mouth. And then Sir Launcelot waked of his swoon, and</a>
<a id='line_28029'>then the hermit staunched his bleeding. And when he might speak he</a>
<a id='line_28030'>asked Sir Launcelot why he put his life in jeopardy. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28031'>Launcelot, because I weened I had been strong, and also Sir Bors told</a>
<a id='line_28032'>me that there should be at All Hallowmass a great jousts betwixt King</a>
<a id='line_28033'>Arthur and the King of Northgalis, and therefore I thought to assay it</a>
<a id='line_28034'>myself whether I might be there or not. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said the</a>
<a id='line_28035'>hermit, your heart and your courage will never be done until your last</a>
<a id='line_28036'>day, but ye shall do now by my counsel. Let Sir Bors depart from you,</a>
<a id='line_28037'>and let him do at that tournament what he may: And by the grace of God,</a>
<a id='line_28038'>said the knight-hermit, by that the tournament be done and ye come</a>
<a id='line_28039'>hither again, Sir Launcelot shall be as whole as ye, so that he will be</a>
<a id='line_28040'>governed by me.</a>
<a id='line_28041'></a>
<a id='line_28042'></a>
<a id='line_28043'></a>
<a id='line_28044'></a>
<a id='line_28045'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Bors returned and told tidings of Sir Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_28046'>and of the tourney, and to whom the prize was given.</a>
<a id='line_28047'></a>
<a id='line_28048'></a>
<a id='line_28049'>Then Sir Bors made him ready to depart from Sir Launcelot; and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_28050'>Launcelot said: Fair cousin, Sir Bors, recommend me unto all them unto</a>
<a id='line_28051'>whom me ought to recommend me unto. And I pray you, enforce yourself at</a>
<a id='line_28052'>that jousts that ye may be best, for my love; and here shall I abide</a>
<a id='line_28053'>you at the mercy of God till ye come again. And so Sir Bors departed</a>
<a id='line_28054'>and came to the court of King Arthur, and told them in what place he</a>
<a id='line_28055'>had left Sir Launcelot. That me repenteth, said the king, but since he</a>
<a id='line_28056'>shall have his life we all may thank God. And there Sir Bors told the</a>
<a id='line_28057'>queen in what jeopardy Sir Launcelot was when he would assay his horse.</a>
<a id='line_28058'>And all that he did, madam, was for the love of you, because he would</a>
<a id='line_28059'>have been at this tournament. Fie on him, recreant knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_28060'>queen, for wit ye well I am right sorry an he shall have his life. His</a>
<a id='line_28061'>life shall he have, said Sir Bors, and who that would otherwise, except</a>
<a id='line_28062'>you, madam, we that be of his blood should help to short their lives.</a>
<a id='line_28063'>But madam, said Sir Bors, ye have been oft-times displeased with my</a>
<a id='line_28064'>lord, Sir Launcelot, but at all times at the end ye find him a true</a>
<a id='line_28065'>knight: and so he departed.</a>
<a id='line_28066'></a>
<a id='line_28067'>And then every knight of the Round Table that were there at that time</a>
<a id='line_28068'>present made them ready to be at that jousts at All Hallowmass, and</a>
<a id='line_28069'>thither drew many knights of divers countries. And as All Hallowmass</a>
<a id='line_28070'>drew near, thither came the King of Northgalis, and the King with the</a>
<a id='line_28071'>Hundred Knights, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince, of Surluse, and</a>
<a id='line_28072'>thither came King Anguish of Ireland, and the King of Scots. So these</a>
<a id='line_28073'>three kings came on King Arthur’s party. And so that day Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_28074'>did great deeds of arms, and began first. And the heralds numbered that</a>
<a id='line_28075'>Sir Gawaine smote down twenty knights. Then Sir Bors de Ganis came in</a>
<a id='line_28076'>the same time, and he was numbered that he smote down twenty knights;</a>
<a id='line_28077'>and therefore the prize was given betwixt them both, for they began</a>
<a id='line_28078'>first and longest endured. Also Sir Gareth, as the book saith, did that</a>
<a id='line_28079'>day great deeds of arms, for he smote down and pulled down thirty</a>
<a id='line_28080'>knights. But when he had done these deeds he tarried not but so</a>
<a id='line_28081'>departed, and therefore he lost his prize. And Sir Palomides did great</a>
<a id='line_28082'>deeds of arms that day, for he smote down twenty knights, but he</a>
<a id='line_28083'>departed suddenly, and men deemed Sir Gareth and he rode together to</a>
<a id='line_28084'>some manner adventures.</a>
<a id='line_28085'></a>
<a id='line_28086'>So when this tournament was done Sir Bors departed and rode till he</a>
<a id='line_28087'>came to Sir Launcelot, his cousin; and then he found him walking on his</a>
<a id='line_28088'>feet, and there either made great joy of other; and so Sir Bors told</a>
<a id='line_28089'>Sir Launcelot of all the Jousts like as ye have heard. I marvel, said</a>
<a id='line_28090'>Sir Launcelot, that Sir Gareth, when he had done such deeds of arms,</a>
<a id='line_28091'>that he would not tarry. Thereof we marvelled all, said Sir Bors, for</a>
<a id='line_28092'>but if it were you, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, I saw</a>
<a id='line_28093'>never knight bear down so many in so little a while as did Sir Gareth:</a>
<a id='line_28094'>and anon he was gone we wist not where. By my head, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28095'>he is a noble knight, and a mighty man and well breathed; and if he</a>
<a id='line_28096'>were well assayed, said Sir Launcelot I would deem he were good enough</a>
<a id='line_28097'>for any knight that beareth the life; and he is a gentle knight,</a>
<a id='line_28098'>courteous, true, and bounteous, meek, and mild, and in him is no manner</a>
<a id='line_28099'>of mal engin, but plain, faithful, and true.</a>
<a id='line_28100'></a>
<a id='line_28101'>So then they made them ready to depart from the hermit. And so upon a</a>
<a id='line_28102'>morn they took their horses and Elaine le Blank with them; and when</a>
<a id='line_28103'>they came to Astolat there were they well lodged, and had great cheer</a>
<a id='line_28104'>of Sir Bernard, the old baron, and of Sir Tirre, his son. And so upon</a>
<a id='line_28105'>the morn when Sir Launcelot should depart, fair Elaine brought her</a>
<a id='line_28106'>father with her, and Sir Lavaine, and Sir Tirre, and thus she said:</a>
<a id='line_28107'></a>
<a id='line_28108'></a>
<a id='line_28109'></a>
<a id='line_28110'></a>
<a id='line_28111'>CHAPTER XIX. Of the great lamentation of the Fair Maid of Astolat when</a>
<a id='line_28112'>Launcelot should depart, and how she died for his love.</a>
<a id='line_28113'></a>
<a id='line_28114'></a>
<a id='line_28115'>My lord, Sir Launcelot, now I see ye will depart; now fair knight and</a>
<a id='line_28116'>courteous knight, have mercy upon me, and suffer me not to die for thy</a>
<a id='line_28117'>love. What would ye that I did? said Sir Launcelot. I would have you to</a>
<a id='line_28118'>my husband, said Elaine. Fair damosel, I thank you, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28119'>but truly, said he, I cast me never to be wedded man. Then, fair</a>
<a id='line_28120'>knight, said she, will ye be my paramour? Jesu defend me, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28121'>Launcelot, for then I rewarded your father and your brother full evil</a>
<a id='line_28122'>for their great goodness. Alas, said she, then must I die for your</a>
<a id='line_28123'>love. Ye shall not so, said Sir Launcelot, for wit ye well, fair</a>
<a id='line_28124'>maiden, I might have been married an I had would, but I never applied</a>
<a id='line_28125'>me to be married yet; but because, fair damosel, that ye love me as ye</a>
<a id='line_28126'>say ye do, I will for your good will and kindness show you some</a>
<a id='line_28127'>goodness, and that is this, that wheresomever ye will beset your heart</a>
<a id='line_28128'>upon some good knight that will wed you, I shall give you together a</a>
<a id='line_28129'>thousand pound yearly to you and to your heirs; thus much will I give</a>
<a id='line_28130'>you, fair madam, for your kindness, and always while I live to be your</a>
<a id='line_28131'>own knight. Of all this, said the maiden, I will none, for but if ye</a>
<a id='line_28132'>will wed me, or else be my paramour at the least, wit you well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28133'>Launcelot, my good days are done. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of</a>
<a id='line_28134'>these two things ye must pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_28135'></a>
<a id='line_28136'>Then she shrieked shrilly, and fell down in a swoon; and then women</a>
<a id='line_28137'>bare her into her chamber, and there she made over much sorrow; and</a>
<a id='line_28138'>then Sir Launcelot would depart, and there he asked Sir Lavaine what he</a>
<a id='line_28139'>would do. What should I do, said Sir Lavaine, but follow you, but if ye</a>
<a id='line_28140'>drive me from you, or command me to go from you. Then came Sir Bernard</a>
<a id='line_28141'>to Sir Launcelot and said to him: I cannot see but that my daughter</a>
<a id='line_28142'>Elaine will die for your sake. I may not do withal, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28143'>for that me sore repenteth, for I report me to yourself, that my</a>
<a id='line_28144'>proffer is fair; and me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, that she loveth</a>
<a id='line_28145'>me as she doth; I was never the causer of it, for I report me to your</a>
<a id='line_28146'>son I early ne late proffered her bounté nor fair behests; and as for</a>
<a id='line_28147'>me, said Sir Launcelot, I dare do all that a knight should do that she</a>
<a id='line_28148'>is a clean maiden for me, both for deed and for will. And I am right</a>
<a id='line_28149'>heavy of her distress, for she is a full fair maiden, good and gentle,</a>
<a id='line_28150'>and well taught. Father, said Sir Lavaine, I dare make good she is a</a>
<a id='line_28151'>clean maiden as for my lord Sir Launcelot; but she doth as I do, for</a>
<a id='line_28152'>sithen I first saw my lord Sir Launcelot, I could never depart from</a>
<a id='line_28153'>him, nor nought I will an I may follow him.</a>
<a id='line_28154'></a>
<a id='line_28155'>Then Sir Launcelot took his leave, and so they departed, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_28156'>Winchester. And when Arthur wist that Sir Launcelot was come whole and</a>
<a id='line_28157'>sound the king made great joy of him, and so did Sir Gawaine and all</a>
<a id='line_28158'>the knights of the Round Table except Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_28159'>Also Queen Guenever was wood wroth with Sir Launcelot, and would by no</a>
<a id='line_28160'>means speak with him, but estranged herself from him; and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_28161'>made all the means that he might for to speak with the queen, but it</a>
<a id='line_28162'>would not be.</a>
<a id='line_28163'></a>
<a id='line_28164'>Now speak we of the Fair Maiden of Astolat that made such sorrow day</a>
<a id='line_28165'>and night that she never slept, ate, nor drank, and ever she made her</a>
<a id='line_28166'>complaint unto Sir Launcelot. So when she had thus endured a ten days,</a>
<a id='line_28167'>that she feebled so that she must needs pass out of this world, then</a>
<a id='line_28168'>she shrived her clean, and received her Creator. And ever she</a>
<a id='line_28169'>complained still upon Sir Launcelot. Then her ghostly father bade her</a>
<a id='line_28170'>leave such thoughts. Then she said, why should I leave such thoughts?</a>
<a id='line_28171'>Am I not an earthly woman? And all the while the breath is in my body I</a>
<a id='line_28172'>may complain me, for my belief is I do none offence though I love an</a>
<a id='line_28173'>earthly man; and I take God to my record I loved never none but Sir</a>
<a id='line_28174'>Launcelot du Lake, nor never shall, and a clean maiden I am for him and</a>
<a id='line_28175'>for all other; and sithen it is the sufferance of God that I shall die</a>
<a id='line_28176'>for the love of so noble a knight, I beseech the High Father of Heaven</a>
<a id='line_28177'>to have mercy upon my soul, and upon mine innumerable pains that I</a>
<a id='line_28178'>suffered may be allegeance of part of my sins. For sweet Lord Jesu,</a>
<a id='line_28179'>said the fair maiden, I take Thee to record, on Thee I was never great</a>
<a id='line_28180'>offencer against thy laws; but that I loved this noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28181'>Launcelot, out of measure, and of myself, good Lord, I might not</a>
<a id='line_28182'>withstand the fervent love wherefore I have my death.</a>
<a id='line_28183'></a>
<a id='line_28184'>And then she called her father, Sir Bernard, and her brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28185'>Tirre, and heartily she prayed her father that her brother might write</a>
<a id='line_28186'>a letter like as she did indite it: and so her father granted her. And</a>
<a id='line_28187'>when the letter was written word by word like as she devised, then she</a>
<a id='line_28188'>prayed her father that she might be watched until she were dead. And</a>
<a id='line_28189'>while my body is hot let this letter be put in my right hand, and my</a>
<a id='line_28190'>hand bound fast with the letter until that I be cold; and let me be put</a>
<a id='line_28191'>in a fair bed with all the richest clothes that I have about me, and so</a>
<a id='line_28192'>let my bed and all my richest clothes be laid with me in a chariot unto</a>
<a id='line_28193'>the next place where Thames is; and there let me be put within a</a>
<a id='line_28194'>barget, and but one man with me, such as ye trust to steer me thither,</a>
<a id='line_28195'>and that my barget be covered with black samite over and over: thus</a>
<a id='line_28196'>father I beseech you let it be done. So her father granted it her</a>
<a id='line_28197'>faithfully, all things should be done like as she had devised. Then her</a>
<a id='line_28198'>father and her brother made great dole, for when this was done anon she</a>
<a id='line_28199'>died. And so when she was dead the corpse and the bed all was led the</a>
<a id='line_28200'>next way unto Thames, and there a man, and the corpse, and all, were</a>
<a id='line_28201'>put into Thames; and so the man steered the barget unto Westminster,</a>
<a id='line_28202'>and there he rowed a great while to and fro or any espied it.</a>
<a id='line_28203'></a>
<a id='line_28204'></a>
<a id='line_28205'></a>
<a id='line_28206'></a>
<a id='line_28207'>CHAPTER XX. How the corpse of the Maid of Astolat arrived to-fore King</a>
<a id='line_28208'>Arthur, and of the burying, and how Sir Launcelot offered the</a>
<a id='line_28209'>mass-penny.</a>
<a id='line_28210'></a>
<a id='line_28211'></a>
<a id='line_28212'>So by fortune King Arthur and the Queen Guenever were speaking together</a>
<a id='line_28213'>at a window, and so as they looked into Thames they espied this black</a>
<a id='line_28214'>barget, and had marvel what it meant. Then the king called Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_28215'>showed it him. Sir, said Sir Kay, wit you well there is some new</a>
<a id='line_28216'>tidings. Go thither, said the king to Sir Kay, and take with you Sir</a>
<a id='line_28217'>Brandiles and Agravaine, and bring me ready word what is there. Then</a>
<a id='line_28218'>these four knights departed and came to the barget and went in; and</a>
<a id='line_28219'>there they found the fairest corpse lying in a rich bed, and a poor man</a>
<a id='line_28220'>sitting in the barget’s end, and no word would he speak. So these four</a>
<a id='line_28221'>knights returned unto the king again, and told him what they found.</a>
<a id='line_28222'>That fair corpse will I see, said the king. And so then the king took</a>
<a id='line_28223'>the queen by the hand, and went thither.</a>
<a id='line_28224'></a>
<a id='line_28225'>Then the king made the barget to be holden fast, and then the king and</a>
<a id='line_28226'>the queen entered with certain knights with them; and there he saw the</a>
<a id='line_28227'>fairest woman lie in a rich bed, covered unto her middle with many rich</a>
<a id='line_28228'>clothes, and all was of cloth of gold, and she lay as though she had</a>
<a id='line_28229'>smiled. Then the queen espied a letter in her right hand, and told it</a>
<a id='line_28230'>to the king. Then the king took it and said: Now am I sure this letter</a>
<a id='line_28231'>will tell what she was, and why she is come hither. So then the king</a>
<a id='line_28232'>and the queen went out of the barget, and so commanded a certain man to</a>
<a id='line_28233'>wait upon the barget.</a>
<a id='line_28234'></a>
<a id='line_28235'>And so when the king was come within his chamber, he called many</a>
<a id='line_28236'>knights about him, and said that he would wit openly what was written</a>
<a id='line_28237'>within that letter. Then the king brake it, and made a clerk to read</a>
<a id='line_28238'>it, and this was the intent of the letter. Most noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28239'>Launcelot, now hath death made us two at debate for your love. I was</a>
<a id='line_28240'>your lover, that men called the Fair Maiden of Astolat; therefore unto</a>
<a id='line_28241'>all ladies I make my moan, yet pray for my soul and bury me at least,</a>
<a id='line_28242'>and offer ye my mass-penny: this is my last request. And a clean maiden</a>
<a id='line_28243'>I died, I take God to witness: pray for my soul, Sir Launcelot, as thou</a>
<a id='line_28244'>art peerless. This was all the substance in the letter. And when it was</a>
<a id='line_28245'>read, the king, the queen, and all the knights wept for pity of the</a>
<a id='line_28246'>doleful complaints. Then was Sir Launcelot sent for; and when he was</a>
<a id='line_28247'>come King Arthur made the letter to be read to him.</a>
<a id='line_28248'></a>
<a id='line_28249'>And when Sir Launcelot heard it word by word, he said: My lord Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_28250'>wit ye well I am right heavy of the death of this fair damosel: God</a>
<a id='line_28251'>knoweth I was never causer of her death by my willing, and that will I</a>
<a id='line_28252'>report me to her own brother: here he is, Sir Lavaine. I will not say</a>
<a id='line_28253'>nay, said Sir Launcelot, but that she was both fair and good, and much</a>
<a id='line_28254'>I was beholden unto her, but she loved me out of measure. Ye might have</a>
<a id='line_28255'>shewed her, said the queen, some bounty and gentleness that might have</a>
<a id='line_28256'>preserved her life. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, she would none other</a>
<a id='line_28257'>ways be answered but that she would be my wife, outher else my</a>
<a id='line_28258'>paramour; and of these two I would not grant her, but I proffered her,</a>
<a id='line_28259'>for her good love that she shewed me, a thousand pound yearly to her,</a>
<a id='line_28260'>and to her heirs, and to wed any manner knight that she could find best</a>
<a id='line_28261'>to love in her heart. For madam, said Sir Launcelot, I love not to be</a>
<a id='line_28262'>constrained to love; for love must arise of the heart, and not by no</a>
<a id='line_28263'>constraint. That is truth, said the king, and many knight’s love is</a>
<a id='line_28264'>free in himself, and never will be bounden, for where he is bounden he</a>
<a id='line_28265'>looseth himself.</a>
<a id='line_28266'></a>
<a id='line_28267'>Then said the king unto Sir Launcelot: It will be your worship that ye</a>
<a id='line_28268'>oversee that she be interred worshipfully. Sir, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28269'>that shall be done as I can best devise. And so many knights yede</a>
<a id='line_28270'>thither to behold that fair maiden. And so upon the morn she was</a>
<a id='line_28271'>interred richly, and Sir Launcelot offered her mass-penny; and all the</a>
<a id='line_28272'>knights of the Table Round that were there at that time offered with</a>
<a id='line_28273'>Sir Launcelot. And then the poor man went again with the barget. Then</a>
<a id='line_28274'>the queen sent for Sir Launcelot, and prayed him of mercy, for why that</a>
<a id='line_28275'>she had been wroth with him causeless. This is not the first time, said</a>
<a id='line_28276'>Sir Launcelot, that ye had been displeased with me causeless, but,</a>
<a id='line_28277'>madam, ever I must suffer you, but what sorrow I endure I take no</a>
<a id='line_28278'>force. So this passed on all that winter, with all manner of hunting</a>
<a id='line_28279'>and hawking, and jousts and tourneys were many betwixt many great</a>
<a id='line_28280'>lords, and ever in all places Sir Lavaine gat great worship, so that he</a>
<a id='line_28281'>was nobly renowned among many knights of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_28282'></a>
<a id='line_28283'></a>
<a id='line_28284'></a>
<a id='line_28285'></a>
<a id='line_28286'>CHAPTER XXI. Of great jousts done all a Christmas, and of a great</a>
<a id='line_28287'>jousts and tourney ordained by King Arthur, and of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_28288'></a>
<a id='line_28289'></a>
<a id='line_28290'>Thus it passed on till Christmas, and then every day there was jousts</a>
<a id='line_28291'>made for a diamond, who that jousted best should have a diamond. But</a>
<a id='line_28292'>Sir Launcelot would not joust but if it were at a great jousts cried.</a>
<a id='line_28293'>But Sir Lavaine jousted there all that Christmas passingly well, and</a>
<a id='line_28294'>best was praised, for there were but few that did so well. Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_28295'>all manner of knights deemed that Sir Lavaine should be made knight of</a>
<a id='line_28296'>the Table Round at the next feast of Pentecost. So at-after Christmas</a>
<a id='line_28297'>King Arthur let call unto him many knights, and there they advised</a>
<a id='line_28298'>together to make a party and a great tournament and jousts. And the</a>
<a id='line_28299'>King of Northgalis said to Arthur, he would have on his party King</a>
<a id='line_28300'>Anguish of Ireland, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King</a>
<a id='line_28301'>of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince. And so these four</a>
<a id='line_28302'>kings and this mighty duke took part against King Arthur and the</a>
<a id='line_28303'>knights of the Table Round. And the cry was made that the day of the</a>
<a id='line_28304'>jousts should be beside Westminster upon Candlemas Day, whereof many</a>
<a id='line_28305'>knights were glad, and made them ready to be at that jousts in the</a>
<a id='line_28306'>freshest manner.</a>
<a id='line_28307'></a>
<a id='line_28308'>Then Queen Guenever sent for Sir Launcelot, and said thus: I warn you</a>
<a id='line_28309'>that ye ride no more in no jousts nor tournaments but that your kinsmen</a>
<a id='line_28310'>may know you. And at these jousts that shall be ye shall have of me a</a>
<a id='line_28311'>sleeve of gold; and I pray you for my sake enforce yourself there, that</a>
<a id='line_28312'>men may speak of you worship; but I charge you as ye will have my love,</a>
<a id='line_28313'>that ye warn your kinsmen that ye will bear that day the sleeve of gold</a>
<a id='line_28314'>upon your helmet. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, it shall be done. And so</a>
<a id='line_28315'>either made great joy of other. And when Sir Launcelot saw his time he</a>
<a id='line_28316'>told Sir Bors that he would depart, and have no more with him but Sir</a>
<a id='line_28317'>Lavaine, unto the good hermit that dwelt in that forest of Windsor; his</a>
<a id='line_28318'>name was Sir Brasias; and there he thought to repose him, and take all</a>
<a id='line_28319'>the rest that he might, because he would be fresh at that day of</a>
<a id='line_28320'>jousts.</a>
<a id='line_28321'></a>
<a id='line_28322'>So Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed, that no creature wist where</a>
<a id='line_28323'>he was become, but the noble men of his blood. And when he was come to</a>
<a id='line_28324'>the hermitage, wit ye well he had good cheer. And so daily Sir</a>
<a id='line_28325'>Launcelot would go to a well fast by the hermitage, and there he would</a>
<a id='line_28326'>lie down, and see the well spring and burble, and sometime he slept</a>
<a id='line_28327'>there. So at that time there was a lady dwelt in that forest, and she</a>
<a id='line_28328'>was a great huntress, and daily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her</a>
<a id='line_28329'>bow with her; and no men went never with her, but always women, and</a>
<a id='line_28330'>they were shooters, and could well kill a deer, both at the stalk and</a>
<a id='line_28331'>at the trest; and they daily bare bows and arrows, horns and</a>
<a id='line_28332'>wood-knives, and many good dogs they had, both for the string and for a</a>
<a id='line_28333'>bait. So it happed this lady the huntress had abated her dog for the</a>
<a id='line_28334'>bow at a barren hind, and so this barren hind took the flight over</a>
<a id='line_28335'>hedges and woods. And ever this lady and part of her women costed the</a>
<a id='line_28336'>hind, and checked it by the noise of the hounds, to have met with the</a>
<a id='line_28337'>hind at some water; and so it happed, the hind came to the well whereas</a>
<a id='line_28338'>Sir Launcelot was sleeping and slumbering. And so when the hind came to</a>
<a id='line_28339'>the well, for heat she went to soil, and there she lay a great while;</a>
<a id='line_28340'>and the dog came after, and umbecast about, for she had lost the very</a>
<a id='line_28341'>perfect feute of the hind. Right so came that lady the huntress, that</a>
<a id='line_28342'>knew by the dog that she had, that the hind was at the soil in that</a>
<a id='line_28343'>well; and there she came stiffly and found the hind, and she put a</a>
<a id='line_28344'>broad arrow in her bow, and shot at the hind, and over-shot the hind;</a>
<a id='line_28345'>and so by misfortune the arrow smote Sir Launcelot in the thick of the</a>
<a id='line_28346'>buttock, over the barbs. When Sir Launcelot felt himself so hurt, he</a>
<a id='line_28347'>hurled up woodly, and saw the lady that had smitten him. And when he</a>
<a id='line_28348'>saw she was a woman, he said thus: Lady or damosel, what that thou be,</a>
<a id='line_28349'>in an evil time bear ye a bow; the devil made you a shooter.</a>
<a id='line_28350'></a>
<a id='line_28351'></a>
<a id='line_28352'></a>
<a id='line_28353'></a>
<a id='line_28354'>CHAPTER XXII. How Launcelot after that he was hurt of a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_28355'>came to an hermit, and of other matters.</a>
<a id='line_28356'></a>
<a id='line_28357'></a>
<a id='line_28358'>Now mercy, fair sir, said the lady, I am a gentlewoman that useth here</a>
<a id='line_28359'>in this forest hunting, and God knoweth I saw ye not; but as here was a</a>
<a id='line_28360'>barren hind at the soil in this well, and I weened to have done well,</a>
<a id='line_28361'>but my hand swerved. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, ye have mischieved me.</a>
<a id='line_28362'>And so the lady departed, and Sir Launcelot as he might pulled out the</a>
<a id='line_28363'>arrow, and left that head still in his buttock, and so he went weakly</a>
<a id='line_28364'>to the hermitage ever more bleeding as he went. And when Sir Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_28365'>and the hermit espied that Sir Launcelot was hurt, wit you well they</a>
<a id='line_28366'>were passing heavy, but Sir Lavaine wist not how that he was hurt nor</a>
<a id='line_28367'>by whom. And then were they wroth out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_28368'></a>
<a id='line_28369'>Then with great pain the hermit gat out the arrow’s head out of Sir</a>
<a id='line_28370'>Launcelot’s buttock, and much of his blood he shed, and the wound was</a>
<a id='line_28371'>passing sore, and unhappily smitten, for it was in such a place that he</a>
<a id='line_28372'>might not sit in no saddle. Have mercy, Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, I may</a>
<a id='line_28373'>call myself the most unhappiest man that liveth, for ever when I would</a>
<a id='line_28374'>fainest have worship there befalleth me ever some unhappy thing. Now so</a>
<a id='line_28375'>Jesu me help, said Sir Launcelot, and if no man would but God, I shall</a>
<a id='line_28376'>be in the field upon Candlemas Day at the jousts, whatsomever fall of</a>
<a id='line_28377'>it: so all that might be gotten to heal Sir Launcelot was had.</a>
<a id='line_28378'></a>
<a id='line_28379'>So when the day was come Sir Launcelot let devise that he was arrayed,</a>
<a id='line_28380'>and Sir Lavaine, and their horses, as though they had been Saracens;</a>
<a id='line_28381'>and so they departed and came nigh to the field. The King of Northgalis</a>
<a id='line_28382'>with an hundred knights with him, and the King of Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_28383'>brought with him an hundred good knights, and King Anguish of Ireland</a>
<a id='line_28384'>brought with him an hundred good knights ready to joust, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28385'>Galahad, the haut prince, brought with him an hundred good knights, and</a>
<a id='line_28386'>the King with the Hundred Knights brought with him as many, and all</a>
<a id='line_28387'>these were proved good knights. Then came in King Arthur’s party; and</a>
<a id='line_28388'>there came in the King of Scots with an hundred knights, and King</a>
<a id='line_28389'>Uriens of Gore brought with him an hundred knights, and King Howel of</a>
<a id='line_28390'>Brittany brought with him an hundred knights, and Chaleins of Clarance</a>
<a id='line_28391'>brought with him an hundred knights, and King Arthur himself came into</a>
<a id='line_28392'>the field with two hundred knights, and the most part were knights of</a>
<a id='line_28393'>the Table Round, that were proved noble knights; and there were old</a>
<a id='line_28394'>knights set in scaffolds for to judge, with the queen, who did best.</a>

<a id='line_28399'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him at the jousts, and other</a>
<a id='line_28400'>men also.</a>
<a id='line_28401'></a>
<a id='line_28402'></a>
<a id='line_28403'>Then they blew to the field; and there the King of Northgalis</a>
<a id='line_28404'>encountered with the King of Scots, and there the King of Scots had a</a>
<a id='line_28405'>fall; and the King of Ireland smote down King Uriens; and the King of</a>
<a id='line_28406'>Northumberland smote down King Howel of Brittany; and Sir Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_28407'>haut prince, smote down Chaleins of Clarance. And then King Arthur was</a>
<a id='line_28408'>wood wroth, and ran to the King with the Hundred Knights, and there</a>
<a id='line_28409'>King Arthur smote him down; and after with that same spear King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_28410'>smote down three other knights. And then when his spear was broken King</a>
<a id='line_28411'>Arthur did passingly well; and so therewithal came in Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_28412'>Sir Gaheris, Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, and there everych of them</a>
<a id='line_28413'>smote down a knight, and Sir Gawaine smote down four knights; and then</a>
<a id='line_28414'>there began a strong medley, for then there came in the knights of</a>
<a id='line_28415'>Launcelot’s blood, and Sir Gareth and Sir Palomides with them, and many</a>
<a id='line_28416'>knights of the Table Round, and they began to hold the four kings and</a>
<a id='line_28417'>the mighty duke so hard that they were discomfit; but this Duke</a>
<a id='line_28418'>Galahad, the haut prince, was a noble knight, and by his mighty prowess</a>
<a id='line_28419'>of arms he held the knights of the Table Round strait enough.</a>
<a id='line_28420'></a>
<a id='line_28421'>All this doing saw Sir Launcelot, and then he came into the field with</a>
<a id='line_28422'>Sir Lavaine as it had been thunder. And then anon Sir Bors and the</a>
<a id='line_28423'>knights of his blood espied Sir Launcelot, and said to them all: I warn</a>
<a id='line_28424'>you beware of him with the sleeve of gold upon his head, for he is</a>
<a id='line_28425'>himself Sir Launcelot du Lake; and for great goodness Sir Bors warned</a>
<a id='line_28426'>Sir Gareth. I am well apaid, said Sir Gareth, that I may know him. But</a>
<a id='line_28427'>who is he, said they all, that rideth with him in the same array? That</a>
<a id='line_28428'>is the good and gentle knight Sir Lavaine, said Sir Bors. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_28429'>Launcelot encountered with Sir Gawaine, and there by force Sir</a>
<a id='line_28430'>Launcelot smote down Sir Gawaine and his horse to the earth, and so he</a>
<a id='line_28431'>smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and also he smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_28432'>Mordred, and all this was with one spear. Then Sir Lavaine met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_28433'>Palomides, and either met other so hard and so fiercely that both their</a>
<a id='line_28434'>horses fell to the earth. And then were they horsed again, and then met</a>
<a id='line_28435'>Sir Launcelot with Sir Palomides, and there Sir Palomides had a fall;</a>
<a id='line_28436'>and so Sir Launcelot or ever he stint, as fast as he might get spears,</a>
<a id='line_28437'>he smote down thirty knights, and the most part of them were knights of</a>
<a id='line_28438'>the Table Round; and ever the knights of his blood withdrew them, and</a>
<a id='line_28439'>made them ado in other places where Sir Launcelot came not.</a>
<a id='line_28440'></a>
<a id='line_28441'>And then King Arthur was wroth when he saw Sir Launcelot do such deeds;</a>
<a id='line_28442'>and then the king called unto him Sir Gawaine, Sir Mordred, Sir Kay,</a>
<a id='line_28443'>Sir Griflet, Sir Lucan the Butler, Sir Bedivere, Sir Palomides, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28444'>Safere, his brother; and so the king with these nine knights made them</a>
<a id='line_28445'>ready to set upon Sir Launcelot, and upon Sir Lavaine. All this espied</a>
<a id='line_28446'>Sir Bors and Sir Gareth. Now I dread me sore, said Sir Bors, that my</a>
<a id='line_28447'>lord, Sir Launcelot, will be hard matched. By my head, said Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_28448'>I will ride unto my lord Sir Launcelot, for to help him, fall of him</a>
<a id='line_28449'>what fall may, for he is the same man that made me knight. Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_28450'>so, said Sir Bors, by my counsel, unless that ye were disguised. Ye</a>
<a id='line_28451'>shall see me disguised, said Sir Gareth; and therewithal he espied a</a>
<a id='line_28452'>Welsh knight where he was to repose him, and he was sore hurt afore by</a>
<a id='line_28453'>Sir Gawaine, and to him Sir Gareth rode, and prayed him of his</a>
<a id='line_28454'>knighthood to lend him his shield for his. I will well, said the Welsh</a>
<a id='line_28455'>knight. And when Sir Gareth had his shield, the book saith it was</a>
<a id='line_28456'>green, with a maiden that seemed in it.</a>
<a id='line_28457'></a>
<a id='line_28458'>Then Sir Gareth came driving to Sir Launcelot all that he might and</a>
<a id='line_28459'>said: Knight, keep thyself, for yonder cometh King Arthur with nine</a>
<a id='line_28460'>noble knights with him to put you to a rebuke, and so I am come to bear</a>
<a id='line_28461'>you fellowship for old love ye have shewed me. Gramercy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28462'>Launcelot. Sir, said Sir Gareth, encounter ye with Sir Gawaine, and I</a>
<a id='line_28463'>shall encounter with Sir Palomides; and let Sir Lavaine match with the</a>
<a id='line_28464'>noble King Arthur. And when we have delivered them, let us three hold</a>
<a id='line_28465'>us sadly together. Then came King Arthur with his nine knights with</a>
<a id='line_28466'>him, and Sir Launcelot encountered with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such</a>
<a id='line_28467'>a buffet that the arson of his saddle brast, and Sir Gawaine fell to</a>
<a id='line_28468'>the earth. Then Sir Gareth encountered with the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_28469'>Palomides, and he gave him such a buffet that both his horse and he</a>
<a id='line_28470'>dashed to the earth. Then encountered King Arthur with Sir Lavaine, and</a>
<a id='line_28471'>there either of them smote other to the earth, horse and all, that they</a>
<a id='line_28472'>lay a great while. Then Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Agravaine, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28473'>Gaheris, and Sir Mordred; and Sir Gareth smote down Sir Kay, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28474'>Safere, and Sir Griflet. And then Sir Lavaine was horsed again, and he</a>
<a id='line_28475'>smote down Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedevere and then there began</a>
<a id='line_28476'>great throng of good knights.</a>
<a id='line_28477'></a>
<a id='line_28478'>Then Sir Launcelot hurtled here and there, and raced and pulled off</a>
<a id='line_28479'>helms, so that at that time there might none sit him a buffet with</a>
<a id='line_28480'>spear nor with sword; and Sir Gareth did such deeds of arms that all</a>
<a id='line_28481'>men marvelled what knight he was with the green shield, for he smote</a>
<a id='line_28482'>down that day and pulled down mo than thirty knights. And, as the</a>
<a id='line_28483'>French book saith, Sir Launcelot marvelled; when he beheld Sir Gareth</a>
<a id='line_28484'>do such deeds, what knight he might be; and Sir Lavaine pulled down and</a>
<a id='line_28485'>smote down twenty knights. Also Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Gareth for</a>
<a id='line_28486'>an Sir Tristram de Liones, outher Sir Lamorak de Galis had been alive,</a>
<a id='line_28487'>Sir Launcelot would have deemed he had been one of them twain. So ever</a>
<a id='line_28488'>as Sir Launcelot Sir Gareth, Sir Lavaine fought, and on the one side</a>
<a id='line_28489'>Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Lionel, Sir Lamorak de Galis, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28490'>Bleoberis, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Pelleas, and with mo other</a>
<a id='line_28491'>of King Ban’s blood fought upon another party, and held the King with</a>
<a id='line_28492'>the Hundred Knights and the King of Northumberland right strait.</a>
<a id='line_28493'></a>
<a id='line_28494'></a>

<a id='line_28496'></a>
<a id='line_28497'>CHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur marvelled much of the jousting in the</a>
<a id='line_28498'>field, and how he rode and found Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_28499'></a>
<a id='line_28500'></a>
<a id='line_28501'>So this tournament and this jousts dured long, till it was near night,</a>
<a id='line_28502'>for the knights of the Round Table relieved ever unto King Arthur; for</a>
<a id='line_28503'>the king was wroth out of measure that he and his knights might not</a>
<a id='line_28504'>prevail that day. Then Sir Gawaine said to the king: I marvel where all</a>
<a id='line_28505'>this day [be] Sir Bors de Ganis and his fellowship of Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_28506'>blood, I marvel all this day they be not about you: it is for some</a>
<a id='line_28507'>cause said Sir Gawaine. By my head, said Sir Kay, Sir Bors is yonder</a>
<a id='line_28508'>all this day upon the right hand of this field, and there he and his</a>
<a id='line_28509'>blood do more worshipfully than we do. It may well be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28510'>Gawaine, but I dread me ever of guile; for on pain of my life, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28511'>Gawaine, this knight with the red sleeve of gold is himself Sir</a>
<a id='line_28512'>Launcelot, I see well by his riding and by his great strokes; and the</a>
<a id='line_28513'>other knight in the same colours is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine.</a>
<a id='line_28514'>Also that knight with the green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and</a>
<a id='line_28515'>yet he hath disguised himself, for no man shall never make him be</a>
<a id='line_28516'>against Sir Launcelot, because he made him knight. By my head, said</a>
<a id='line_28517'>Arthur, nephew, I believe you; therefore tell me now what is your best</a>
<a id='line_28518'>counsel. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall have my counsel: let blow unto</a>
<a id='line_28519'>lodging, for an he be Sir Launcelot du Lake, and my brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28520'>Gareth, with him, with the help of that good young knight, Sir Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_28521'>trust me truly it will be no boot to strive with them but if we should</a>
<a id='line_28522'>fall ten or twelve upon one knight, and that were no worship, but</a>
<a id='line_28523'>shame. Ye say truth, said the king; and for to say sooth, said the</a>
<a id='line_28524'>king, it were shame to us so many as we be to set upon them any more;</a>
<a id='line_28525'>for wit ye well, said King Arthur, they be three good knights, and</a>
<a id='line_28526'>namely that knight with the sleeve of gold.</a>
<a id='line_28527'></a>
<a id='line_28528'>So then they blew unto lodging; but forthwithal King Arthur let send</a>
<a id='line_28529'>unto the four kings, and to the mighty duke, and prayed them that the</a>
<a id='line_28530'>knight with the sleeve of gold depart not from them, but that the king</a>
<a id='line_28531'>may speak with him. Then forthwithal King Arthur alighted and unarmed</a>
<a id='line_28532'>him, and took a little hackney and rode after Sir Launcelot, for ever</a>
<a id='line_28533'>he had a spy upon him. And so he found him among the four kings and the</a>
<a id='line_28534'>duke; and there the king prayed them all unto supper, and they said</a>
<a id='line_28535'>they would with good will. And when they were unarmed then King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_28536'>knew Sir Launcelot, Sir Lavaine, and Sir Gareth. Ah, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28537'>said King Arthur, this day ye have heated me and my knights.</a>
<a id='line_28538'></a>
<a id='line_28539'>So they yede unto Arthur’s lodging all together, and there was a great</a>
<a id='line_28540'>feast and great revel, and the prize was given unto Sir Launcelot; and</a>
<a id='line_28541'>by heralds they named him that he had smitten down fifty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_28542'>Sir Gareth five-and-thirty, and Sir Lavaine four-and-twenty knights.</a>
<a id='line_28543'>Then Sir Launcelot told the king and the queen how the lady huntress</a>
<a id='line_28544'>shot him in the forest of Windsor, in the buttock, with an broad arrow,</a>
<a id='line_28545'>and how the wound thereof was that time six inches deep, and in like</a>
<a id='line_28546'>long. Also Arthur blamed Sir Gareth because he left his fellowship and</a>
<a id='line_28547'>held with Sir Launcelot. My lord, said Sir Gareth, he made me a knight,</a>
<a id='line_28548'>and when I saw him so hard bestead, methought it was my worship to help</a>
<a id='line_28549'>him, for I saw him do so much, and so many noble knights against him;</a>
<a id='line_28550'>and when I understood that he was Sir Launcelot du Lake, I shamed to</a>
<a id='line_28551'>see so many knights against him alone. Truly, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_28552'>Gareth, ye say well, and worshipfully have ye done and to yourself</a>
<a id='line_28553'>great worship; and all the days of my life, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_28554'>Gareth, wit you well I shall love you, and trust you the more better.</a>
<a id='line_28555'>For ever, said Arthur, it is a worshipful knight’s deed to help another</a>
<a id='line_28556'>worshipful knight when he seeth him in a great danger; for ever a</a>
<a id='line_28557'>worshipful man will be loath to see a worshipful man shamed; and he</a>
<a id='line_28558'>that is of no worship, and fareth with cowardice, never shall he show</a>
<a id='line_28559'>gentleness, nor no manner of goodness where he seeth a man in any</a>
<a id='line_28560'>danger, for then ever will a coward show no mercy; and always a good</a>
<a id='line_28561'>man will do ever to another man as he would be done to himself. So then</a>
<a id='line_28562'>there were great feasts unto kings and dukes, and revel, game, and</a>
<a id='line_28563'>play, and all manner of noblesse was used; and he that was courteous,</a>
<a id='line_28564'>true, and faithful, to his friend was that time cherished.</a>

<a id='line_28570'></a>
<a id='line_28571'></a>
<a id='line_28572'>And thus it passed on from Candlemass until after Easter, that the</a>
<a id='line_28573'>month of May was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom, and</a>
<a id='line_28574'>to bring forth fruit; for like as herbs and trees bring forth fruit and</a>
<a id='line_28575'>flourish in May, in like wise every lusty heart that is in any manner a</a>
<a id='line_28576'>lover, springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds. For it giveth unto all</a>
<a id='line_28577'>lovers courage, that lusty month of May, in something to constrain him</a>
<a id='line_28578'>to some manner of thing more in that month than in any other month, for</a>
<a id='line_28579'>divers causes. For then all herbs and trees renew a man and woman, and</a>
<a id='line_28580'>likewise lovers call again to their mind old gentleness and old</a>
<a id='line_28581'>service, and many kind deeds that were forgotten by negligence. For</a>
<a id='line_28582'>like as winter rasure doth alway arase and deface green summer, so</a>
<a id='line_28583'>fareth it by unstable love in man and woman. For in many persons there</a>
<a id='line_28584'>is no stability; for we may see all day, for a little blast of winter’s</a>
<a id='line_28585'>rasure, anon we shall deface and lay apart true love for little or</a>
<a id='line_28586'>nought, that cost much thing; this is no wisdom nor stability, but it</a>
<a id='line_28587'>is feebleness of nature and great disworship, whosomever useth this.</a>
<a id='line_28588'>Therefore, like as May month flowereth and flourisheth in many gardens,</a>
<a id='line_28589'>so in like wise let every man of worship flourish his heart in this</a>
<a id='line_28590'>world, first unto God, and next unto the joy of them that he promised</a>
<a id='line_28591'>his faith unto; for there was never worshipful man or worshipful woman,</a>
<a id='line_28592'>but they loved one better than another; and worship in arms may never</a>
<a id='line_28593'>be foiled, but first reserve the honour to God, and secondly the</a>
<a id='line_28594'>quarrel must come of thy lady: and such love I call virtuous love.</a>
<a id='line_28595'></a>
<a id='line_28596'>But nowadays men can not love seven night but they must have all their</a>
<a id='line_28597'>desires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon</a>
<a id='line_28598'>accorded and hasty heat, soon it cooleth. Right so fareth love</a>
<a id='line_28599'>nowadays, soon hot soon cold: this is no stability. But the old love</a>
<a id='line_28600'>was not so; men and women could love together seven years, and no</a>
<a id='line_28601'>licours lusts were between them, and then was love, truth, and</a>
<a id='line_28602'>faithfulness: and lo, in like wise was used love in King Arthur’s days.</a>
<a id='line_28603'>Wherefore I liken love nowadays unto summer and winter; for like as the</a>
<a id='line_28604'>one is hot and the other cold, so fareth love nowadays; therefore all</a>
<a id='line_28605'>ye that be lovers call unto your remembrance the month of May, like as</a>
<a id='line_28606'>did Queen Guenever, for whom I make here a little mention, that while</a>
<a id='line_28607'>she lived she was a true lover, and therefore she had a good end.</a>

<a id='line_28623'>So it befell in the month of May, Queen Guenever called unto her</a>
<a id='line_28624'>knights of the Table Round; and she gave them warning that early upon</a>
<a id='line_28625'>the morrow she would ride a-Maying into woods and fields beside</a>
<a id='line_28626'>Westminster. And I warn you that there be none of you but that he be</a>
<a id='line_28627'>well horsed, and that ye all be clothed in green, outher in silk outher</a>
<a id='line_28628'>in cloth; and I shall bring with me ten ladies, and every knight shall</a>
<a id='line_28629'>have a lady behind him, and every knight shall have a squire and two</a>
<a id='line_28630'>yeomen; and I will that ye all be well horsed. So they made them ready</a>
<a id='line_28631'>in the freshest manner. And these were the names of the knights: Sir</a>
<a id='line_28632'>Kay le Seneschal, Sir Agravaine, Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_28633'>Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Ladinas</a>
<a id='line_28634'>of the Forest Savage, Sir Persant of Inde, Sir Ironside, that was</a>
<a id='line_28635'>called the Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Pelleas, the lover; and</a>
<a id='line_28636'>these ten knights made them ready in the freshest manner to ride with</a>
<a id='line_28637'>the queen. And so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen,</a>
<a id='line_28638'>and rode a-Maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them, in great joy</a>
<a id='line_28639'>and delights; for the queen had cast to have been again with King</a>
<a id='line_28640'>Arthur at the furthest by ten of the clock, and so was that time her</a>
<a id='line_28641'>purpose.</a>
<a id='line_28642'></a>
<a id='line_28643'>Then there was a knight that hight Meliagrance, and he was son unto</a>
<a id='line_28644'>King Bagdemagus, and this knight had at that time a castle of the gift</a>
<a id='line_28645'>of King Arthur within seven mile of Westminster. And this knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28646'>Meliagrance, loved passing well Queen Guenever, and so had he done long</a>
<a id='line_28647'>and many years. And the book saith he had lain in await for to steal</a>
<a id='line_28648'>away the queen, but evermore he forbare for because of Sir Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_28649'>for in no wise he would meddle with the queen an Sir Launcelot were in</a>
<a id='line_28650'>her company, outher else an he were near-hand her. And that time was</a>
<a id='line_28651'>such a custom, the queen rode never without a great fellowship of men</a>
<a id='line_28652'>of arms about her, and they were many good knights, and the most part</a>
<a id='line_28653'>were young men that would have worship; and they were called the</a>
<a id='line_28654'>Queen’s Knights, and never in no battle, tournament, nor jousts, they</a>
<a id='line_28655'>bare none of them no manner of knowledging of their own arms, but plain</a>
<a id='line_28656'>white shields, and thereby they were called the Queen’s Knights. And</a>
<a id='line_28657'>then when it happed any of them to be of great worship by his noble</a>
<a id='line_28658'>deeds, then at the next Feast of Pentecost, if there were any slain or</a>
<a id='line_28659'>dead, as there was none year that there failed but some were dead, then</a>
<a id='line_28660'>was there chosen in his stead that was dead the most men of worship,</a>
<a id='line_28661'>that were called the Queen’s Knights. And thus they came up all first,</a>
<a id='line_28662'>or they were renowned men of worship, both Sir Launcelot and all the</a>
<a id='line_28663'>remnant of them.</a>
<a id='line_28664'></a>
<a id='line_28665'>But this knight, Sir Meliagrance, had espied the queen well and her</a>
<a id='line_28666'>purpose, and how Sir Launcelot was not with her, and how she had no men</a>
<a id='line_28667'>of arms with her but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for</a>
<a id='line_28668'>Maying. Then he purveyed him a twenty men of arms and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_28669'>archers for to destroy the queen and her knights, for he thought that</a>
<a id='line_28670'>time was best season to take the queen.</a>
<a id='line_28671'></a>
<a id='line_28672'></a>
<a id='line_28673'></a>
<a id='line_28674'></a>
<a id='line_28675'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Meliagrance took the queen and her knights, which</a>
<a id='line_28676'>were sore hurt in fighting.</a>
<a id='line_28677'></a>
<a id='line_28678'></a>
<a id='line_28679'>So as the queen had Mayed and all her knights, all were bedashed with</a>
<a id='line_28680'>herbs, mosses and flowers, in the best manner and freshest. Right so</a>
<a id='line_28681'>came out of a wood Sir Meliagrance with an eight score men well</a>
<a id='line_28682'>harnessed, as they should fight in a battle of arrest, and bade the</a>
<a id='line_28683'>queen and her knights abide, for maugre their heads they should abide.</a>
<a id='line_28684'>Traitor knight, said Queen Guenever, what cast thou for to do? Wilt</a>
<a id='line_28685'>thou shame thyself? Bethink thee how thou art a king’s son, and knight</a>
<a id='line_28686'>of the Table Round, and thou to be about to dishonour the noble king</a>
<a id='line_28687'>that made thee knight; thou shamest all knighthood and thyself, and me,</a>
<a id='line_28688'>I let thee wit, shalt thou never shame, for I had liefer cut mine own</a>
<a id='line_28689'>throat in twain rather than thou shouldest dishonour me. As for all</a>
<a id='line_28690'>this language, said Sir Meliagrance, be it as it be may, for wit you</a>
<a id='line_28691'>well, madam, I have loved you many a year, and never or now could I get</a>
<a id='line_28692'>you at such an advantage as I do now, and therefore I will take you as</a>
<a id='line_28693'>I find you.</a>
<a id='line_28694'></a>
<a id='line_28695'>Then spake all the ten noble knights at once and said: Sir Meliagrance,</a>
<a id='line_28696'>wit thou well ye are about to jeopard your worship to dishonour, and</a>
<a id='line_28697'>also ye cast to jeopard our persons howbeit we be unarmed. Ye have us</a>
<a id='line_28698'>at a great avail, for it seemeth by you that ye have laid watch upon</a>
<a id='line_28699'>us; but rather than ye should put the queen to a shame and us all, we</a>
<a id='line_28700'>had as lief to depart from our lives, for an if we other ways did, we</a>
<a id='line_28701'>were shamed for ever. Then said Sir Meliagrance: Dress you as well ye</a>
<a id='line_28702'>can, and keep the queen. Then the ten knights of the Table Round drew</a>
<a id='line_28703'>their swords, and the other let run at them with their spears, and the</a>
<a id='line_28704'>ten knights manly abode them, and smote away their spears that no spear</a>
<a id='line_28705'>did them none harm. Then they lashed together with swords, and anon Sir</a>
<a id='line_28706'>Kay, Sir Sagramore, Sir Agravaine, Sir Dodinas, Sir Ladinas, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_28707'>Ozanna were smitten to the earth with grimly wounds. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_28708'>Brandiles, and Sir Persant, Sir Ironside, Sir Pelleas fought long, and</a>
<a id='line_28709'>they were sore wounded, for these ten knights, or ever they were laid</a>
<a id='line_28710'>to the ground, slew forty men of the boldest and the best of them.</a>
<a id='line_28711'></a>
<a id='line_28712'>So when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully wounded, and needs</a>
<a id='line_28713'>must be slain at the last, then for pity and sorrow she cried Sir</a>
<a id='line_28714'>Meliagrance: Slay not my noble knights, and I will go with thee upon</a>
<a id='line_28715'>this covenant, that thou save them, and suffer them not to be no more</a>
<a id='line_28716'>hurt, with this, that they be led with me wheresomever thou leadest me,</a>
<a id='line_28717'>for I will rather slay myself than I will go with thee, unless that</a>
<a id='line_28718'>these my noble knights may be in my presence. Madam, said Meliagrance,</a>
<a id='line_28719'>for your sake they shall be led with you into mine own castle, with</a>
<a id='line_28720'>that ye will be ruled, and ride with me. Then the queen prayed the four</a>
<a id='line_28721'>knights to leave their fighting, and she and they would not depart.</a>
<a id='line_28722'>Madam, said Sir Pelleas, we will do as ye do, for as for me I take no</a>
<a id='line_28723'>force of my life nor death. For as the French book saith, Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_28724'>gave such buffets there that none armour might hold him.</a>
<a id='line_28725'></a>
<a id='line_28726'></a>
<a id='line_28727'></a>
<a id='line_28728'></a>
<a id='line_28729'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot had word how the queen was taken, and</a>
<a id='line_28730'>how Sir Meliagrance laid a bushment for Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_28731'></a>
<a id='line_28732'></a>
<a id='line_28733'>Then by the queen’s commandment they left battle, and dressed the</a>
<a id='line_28734'>wounded knights on horseback, some sitting, some overthwart their</a>
<a id='line_28735'>horses, that it was pity to behold them. And then Sir Meliagrance</a>
<a id='line_28736'>charged the queen and all her knights that none of all her fellowship</a>
<a id='line_28737'>should depart from her; for full sore he dread Sir Launcelot du Lake,</a>
<a id='line_28738'>lest he should have any knowledging. All this espied the queen, and</a>
<a id='line_28739'>privily she called unto her a child of her chamber that was swiftly</a>
<a id='line_28740'>horsed, to whom she said: Go thou, when thou seest thy time, and bear</a>
<a id='line_28741'>this ring unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and pray him as he loveth me that</a>
<a id='line_28742'>he will see me and rescue me, if ever he will have joy of me; and spare</a>
<a id='line_28743'>not thy horse, said the queen, neither for water, neither for land. So</a>
<a id='line_28744'>the child espied his time, and lightly he took his horse with the</a>
<a id='line_28745'>spurs, and departed as fast as he might. And when Sir Meliagrance saw</a>
<a id='line_28746'>him so flee, he understood that it was by the queen’s commandment for</a>
<a id='line_28747'>to warn Sir Launcelot. Then they that were best horsed chased him and</a>
<a id='line_28748'>shot at him, but from them all the child went suddenly. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_28749'>Meliagrance said to the queen: Madam, ye are about to betray me, but I</a>
<a id='line_28750'>shall ordain for Sir Launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you.</a>
<a id='line_28751'>And then he rode with her, and they all, to his castle, in all the</a>
<a id='line_28752'>haste that they might. And by the way Sir Meliagrance laid in an</a>
<a id='line_28753'>embushment the best archers that he might get in his country, to the</a>
<a id='line_28754'>number of thirty, to await upon Sir Launcelot, charging them that if</a>
<a id='line_28755'>they saw such a manner of knight come by the way upon a white horse,</a>
<a id='line_28756'>that in any wise they slay his horse, but in no manner of wise have not</a>
<a id='line_28757'>ado with him bodily, for he is over-hardy to be overcome.</a>
<a id='line_28758'></a>
<a id='line_28759'>So this was done, and they were come to his castle, but in no wise the</a>
<a id='line_28760'>queen would never let none of the ten knights and her ladies out of her</a>
<a id='line_28761'>sight, but always they were in her presence; for the book saith, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28762'>Meliagrance durst make no masteries, for dread of Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28763'>insomuch he deemed that he had warning. So when the child was departed</a>
<a id='line_28764'>from the fellowship of Sir Meliagrance, within a while he came to</a>
<a id='line_28765'>Westminster, and anon he found Sir Launcelot. And when he had told his</a>
<a id='line_28766'>message, and delivered him the queen’s ring: Alas, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28767'>now I am shamed for ever, unless that I may rescue that noble lady from</a>
<a id='line_28768'>dishonour. Then eagerly he asked his armour; and ever the child told</a>
<a id='line_28769'>Sir Launcelot how the ten knights fought marvellously, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_28770'>Pelleas, and Sir Ironside, and Sir Brandiles, and Sir Persant of Inde,</a>
<a id='line_28771'>fought strongly, but namely Sir Pelleas, there might none withstand</a>
<a id='line_28772'>him; and how they all fought till at the last they were laid to the</a>
<a id='line_28773'>earth; and then the queen made appointment for to save their lives, and</a>
<a id='line_28774'>go with Sir Meliagrance.</a>
<a id='line_28775'></a>
<a id='line_28776'>Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that most noble lady, that she should be so</a>
<a id='line_28777'>destroyed; I had liefer, said Sir Launcelot, than all France, that I</a>
<a id='line_28778'>had been there well armed. So when Sir Launcelot was armed and upon his</a>
<a id='line_28779'>horse, he prayed the child of the queen’s chamber to warn Sir Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_28780'>how suddenly he was departed, and for what cause. And pray him as he</a>
<a id='line_28781'>loveth me, that he will hie him after me, and that he stint not until</a>
<a id='line_28782'>he come to the castle where Sir Meliagrance abideth, or dwelleth; for</a>
<a id='line_28783'>there, said Sir Launcelot, he shall hear of me an I am a man living,</a>
<a id='line_28784'>and rescue the queen and the ten knights the which he traitorously hath</a>
<a id='line_28785'>taken, and that shall I prove upon his head, and all them that hold</a>
<a id='line_28786'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_28787'></a>
<a id='line_28788'></a>
<a id='line_28789'></a>
<a id='line_28790'></a>
<a id='line_28791'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot’s horse was slain, and how Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_28792'>rode in a cart for to rescue the queen.</a>
<a id='line_28793'></a>
<a id='line_28794'></a>
<a id='line_28795'>Then Sir Launcelot rode as fast as he might, and the book saith he took</a>
<a id='line_28796'>the water at Westminster Bridge, and made his horse to swim over Thames</a>
<a id='line_28797'>unto Lambeth. And then within a while he came to the same place thereas</a>
<a id='line_28798'>the ten noble knights fought with Sir Meliagrance. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_28799'>Launcelot followed the track until that he came to a wood, and there</a>
<a id='line_28800'>was a straight way, and there the thirty archers bade Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_28801'>turn again, and follow no longer that track. What commandment have ye</a>
<a id='line_28802'>thereto, said Sir Launcelot, to cause me that am a knight of the Round</a>
<a id='line_28803'>Table to leave my right way? This way shalt thou leave, other-else thou</a>
<a id='line_28804'>shalt go it on thy foot, for wit thou well thy horse shall be slain.</a>
<a id='line_28805'>That is little mastery, said Sir Launcelot, to slay mine horse; but as</a>
<a id='line_28806'>for myself, when my horse is slain, I give right nought for you, not an</a>
<a id='line_28807'>ye were five hundred more. So then they shot Sir Launcelot’s horse, and</a>
<a id='line_28808'>smote him with many arrows; and then Sir Launcelot avoided his horse,</a>
<a id='line_28809'>and went on foot; but there were so many ditches and hedges betwixt</a>
<a id='line_28810'>them and him that he might not meddle with none of them. Alas for</a>
<a id='line_28811'>shame, said Launcelot, that ever one knight should betray another</a>
<a id='line_28812'>knight; but it is an old saw, A good man is never in danger but when he</a>
<a id='line_28813'>is in the danger of a coward. Then Sir Launcelot went a while, and then</a>
<a id='line_28814'>he was foul cumbered of his armour, his shield, and his spear, and all</a>
<a id='line_28815'>that longed unto him. Wit ye well he was full sore annoyed, and full</a>
<a id='line_28816'>loath he was for to leave anything that longed unto him, for he dread</a>
<a id='line_28817'>sore the treason of Sir Meliagrance.</a>
<a id='line_28818'></a>
<a id='line_28819'>Then by fortune there came by him a chariot that came thither for to</a>
<a id='line_28820'>fetch wood. Say me, carter, said Sir Launcelot, what shall I give thee</a>
<a id='line_28821'>to suffer me to leap into thy chariot, and that thou bring me unto a</a>
<a id='line_28822'>castle within this two mile? Thou shalt not come within my chariot,</a>
<a id='line_28823'>said the carter, for I am sent for to fetch wood for my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28824'>Meliagrance. With him would I speak. Thou shalt not go with me, said</a>
<a id='line_28825'>the carter. Then Sir Launcelot leapt to him, and gave him such a buffet</a>
<a id='line_28826'>that he fell to the earth stark dead. Then the other carter, his</a>
<a id='line_28827'>fellow, was afeard, and weened to have gone the same way; and then he</a>
<a id='line_28828'>cried: Fair lord, save my life, and I shall bring you where ye will.</a>
<a id='line_28829'>Then I charge thee, said Sir Launcelot, that thou drive me and this</a>
<a id='line_28830'>chariot even unto Sir Meliagrance’s gate. Leap up into the chariot,</a>
<a id='line_28831'>said the carter, and ye shall be there anon. So the carter drove on a</a>
<a id='line_28832'>great wallop, and Sir Launcelot’s horse followed the chariot, with more</a>
<a id='line_28833'>than a forty arrows broad and rough in him.</a>
<a id='line_28834'></a>
<a id='line_28835'>And more than an hour and an half Dame Guenever was awaiting in a bay</a>
<a id='line_28836'>window with her ladies, and espied an armed knight standing in a</a>
<a id='line_28837'>chariot. See, madam, said a lady, where rideth in a chariot a goodly</a>
<a id='line_28838'>armed knight; I suppose he rideth unto hanging. Where? said the queen.</a>
<a id='line_28839'>Then she espied by his shield that he was there himself, Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_28840'>du Lake. And then she was ware where came his horse ever after that</a>
<a id='line_28841'>chariot, and ever he trod his guts and his paunch under his feet. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_28842'>said the queen, now I see well and prove, that well is him that hath a</a>
<a id='line_28843'>trusty friend. Ha, ha, most noble knight, said Queen Guenever, I see</a>
<a id='line_28844'>well thou art hard bestead when thou ridest in a chariot. Then she</a>
<a id='line_28845'>rebuked that lady that likened Sir Launcelot to ride in a chariot to</a>
<a id='line_28846'>hanging. It was foul mouthed, said the queen, and evil likened, so for</a>
<a id='line_28847'>to liken the most noble knight of the world unto such a shameful death.</a>
<a id='line_28848'>O Jesu defend him and keep him, said the queen, from all mischievous</a>
<a id='line_28849'>end. By this was Sir Launcelot come to the gates of that castle, and</a>
<a id='line_28850'>there he descended down, and cried, that all the castle rang of it:</a>
<a id='line_28851'>Where art thou, false traitor, Sir Meliagrance, and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_28852'>Round? now come forth here, thou traitor knight, thou and thy</a>
<a id='line_28853'>fellowship with thee; for here I am, Sir Launcelot du Lake, that shall</a>
<a id='line_28854'>fight with you. And therewithal he bare the gate wide open upon the</a>
<a id='line_28855'>porter, and smote him under his ear with his gauntlet, that his neck</a>
<a id='line_28856'>brast a-sunder.</a>
<a id='line_28857'></a>

<a id='line_28860'></a>
<a id='line_28861'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Meliagrance required forgiveness of the queen, and</a>
<a id='line_28862'>how she appeased Sir Launcelot; and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_28863'></a>
<a id='line_28864'></a>
<a id='line_28865'>When Sir Meliagrance heard that Sir Launcelot was there he ran unto</a>
<a id='line_28866'>Queen Guenever, and fell upon his knee, and said: Mercy, madam, now I</a>
<a id='line_28867'>put me wholly into your grace. What aileth you now? said Queen</a>
<a id='line_28868'>Guenever; forsooth I might well wit some good knight would revenge me,</a>
<a id='line_28869'>though my lord Arthur wist not of this your work. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28870'>Meliagrance, all this that is amiss on my part shall be amended right</a>
<a id='line_28871'>as yourself will devise, and wholly I put me in your grace. What would</a>
<a id='line_28872'>ye that I did? said the queen. I would no more, said Meliagrance, but</a>
<a id='line_28873'>that ye would take all in your own hands, and that ye will rule my lord</a>
<a id='line_28874'>Sir Launcelot; and such cheer as may be made him in this poor castle ye</a>
<a id='line_28875'>and he shall have until to-morn, and then may ye and all they return</a>
<a id='line_28876'>unto Westminster; and my body and all that I have I shall put in your</a>
<a id='line_28877'>rule. Ye say well, said the queen, and better is peace than ever war,</a>
<a id='line_28878'>and the less noise the more is my worship.</a>
<a id='line_28879'></a>
<a id='line_28880'>Then the queen and her ladies went down unto the knight, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28881'>that stood wroth out of measure in the inner court, to abide battle;</a>
<a id='line_28882'>and ever he bade: Thou traitor knight come forth. Then the queen came</a>
<a id='line_28883'>to him and said: Sir Launcelot, why be ye so moved? Ha, madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28884'>Launcelot, why ask ye me that question? Meseemeth, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28885'>ye ought to be more wroth than I am, for ye have the hurt and the</a>
<a id='line_28886'>dishonour, for wit ye well, madam, my hurt is but little for the</a>
<a id='line_28887'>killing of a mare’s son, but the despite grieveth me much more than all</a>
<a id='line_28888'>my hurt. Truly, said the queen, ye say truth; but heartily I thank you,</a>
<a id='line_28889'>said the queen, but ye must come in with me peaceably, for all thing is</a>
<a id='line_28890'>put in my hand, and all that is evil shall be for the best, for the</a>
<a id='line_28891'>knight full sore repenteth him of the misadventure that is befallen</a>
<a id='line_28892'>him. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, sith it is so that ye been accorded</a>
<a id='line_28893'>with him, as for me I may not be again it, howbeit Sir Meliagrance hath</a>
<a id='line_28894'>done full shamefully to me, and cowardly. Ah madam, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_28895'>an I had wist ye would have been so soon accorded with him I would not</a>
<a id='line_28896'>have made such haste unto you. Why say ye so, said the queen, do ye</a>
<a id='line_28897'>forthink yourself of your good deeds? Wit you well, said the queen, I</a>
<a id='line_28898'>accorded never unto him for favour nor love that I had unto him, but</a>
<a id='line_28899'>for to lay down every shameful noise. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_28900'>understand full well I was never willing nor glad of shameful slander</a>
<a id='line_28901'>nor noise; and there is neither king, queen, nor knight, that beareth</a>
<a id='line_28902'>the life, except my lord King Arthur, and you, madam, should let me,</a>
<a id='line_28903'>but I should make Sir Meliagrance’s heart full cold or ever I departed</a>
<a id='line_28904'>from hence. That wot I well, said the queen, but what will ye more? Ye</a>
<a id='line_28905'>shall have all thing ruled as ye list to have it. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28906'>Launcelot, so ye be pleased I care not, as for my part ye shall soon</a>
<a id='line_28907'>please.</a>
<a id='line_28908'></a>
<a id='line_28909'>Right so the queen took Sir Launcelot by the bare hand, for he had put</a>
<a id='line_28910'>off his gauntlet, and so she went with him till her chamber; and then</a>
<a id='line_28911'>she commanded him to be unarmed. And then Sir Launcelot asked where</a>
<a id='line_28912'>were the ten knights that were wounded sore; so she showed them unto</a>
<a id='line_28913'>Sir Launcelot, and there they made great joy of the coming of him, and</a>
<a id='line_28914'>Sir Launcelot made great dole of their hurts, and bewailed them</a>
<a id='line_28915'>greatly. And there Sir Launcelot told them how cowardly and traitorly</a>
<a id='line_28916'>Meliagrance set archers to slay his horse, and how he was fain to put</a>
<a id='line_28917'>himself in a chariot. Thus they complained everych to other; and full</a>
<a id='line_28918'>fain they would have been revenged, but they peaced themselves because</a>
<a id='line_28919'>of the queen. Then, as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot was called</a>
<a id='line_28920'>many a day after le Chevaler du Chariot, and did many deeds, and great</a>
<a id='line_28921'>adventures he had. And so leave we of this tale le Chevaler du Chariot,</a>
<a id='line_28922'>and turn we to this tale.</a>
<a id='line_28923'></a>
<a id='line_28924'>So Sir Launcelot had great cheer with the queen, and then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_28925'>made a promise with the queen that the same night Sir Launcelot should</a>
<a id='line_28926'>come to a window outward toward a garden; and that window was y-barred</a>
<a id='line_28927'>with iron, and there Sir Launcelot promised to meet her when all folks</a>
<a id='line_28928'>were asleep. So then came Sir Lavaine driving to the gates, crying:</a>
<a id='line_28929'>Where is my lord, Sir Launcelot du Lake? Then was he sent for, and when</a>
<a id='line_28930'>Sir Lavaine saw Sir Launcelot, he said: My lord, I found well how ye</a>
<a id='line_28931'>were hard bestead, for I have found your horse that was slain with</a>
<a id='line_28932'>arrows. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, I pray you, Sir Lavaine, speak</a>
<a id='line_28933'>ye of other matters, and let ye this pass, and we shall right it</a>
<a id='line_28934'>another time when we best may.</a>
<a id='line_28935'></a>
<a id='line_28936'></a>
<a id='line_28937'></a>
<a id='line_28938'></a>
<a id='line_28939'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot came in the night to the queen and lay</a>
<a id='line_28940'>with her, and how Sir Meliagrance appeached the queen of treason.</a>
<a id='line_28941'></a>
<a id='line_28942'></a>
<a id='line_28943'>Then the knights that were hurt were searched, and soft salves were</a>
<a id='line_28944'>laid to their wounds; and so it passed on till supper time, and all the</a>
<a id='line_28945'>cheer that might be made them there was done unto the queen and all her</a>
<a id='line_28946'>knights. Then when season was, they went unto their chambers, but in no</a>
<a id='line_28947'>wise the queen would not suffer the wounded knights to be from her, but</a>
<a id='line_28948'>that they were laid within draughts by her chamber, upon beds and</a>
<a id='line_28949'>pillows, that she herself might see to them, that they wanted nothing.</a>
<a id='line_28950'></a>
<a id='line_28951'>So when Sir Launcelot was in his chamber that was assigned unto him, he</a>
<a id='line_28952'>called unto him Sir Lavaine, and told him that night he must go speak</a>
<a id='line_28953'>with his lady, Dame Guenever. Sir, said Sir Lavaine, let me go with you</a>
<a id='line_28954'>an it please you, for I dread me sore of the treason of Sir</a>
<a id='line_28955'>Meliagrance. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you, but I will have</a>
<a id='line_28956'>nobody with me. Then Sir Launcelot took his sword in his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_28957'>privily went to a place where he had espied a ladder to-forehand, and</a>
<a id='line_28958'>that he took under his arm, and bare it through the garden, and set it</a>
<a id='line_28959'>up to the window, and there anon the queen was ready to meet him. And</a>
<a id='line_28960'>then they made either to other their complaints of many divers things,</a>
<a id='line_28961'>and then Sir Launcelot wished that he might have come into her. Wit ye</a>
<a id='line_28962'>well, said the queen, I would as fain as ye, that ye might come in to</a>
<a id='line_28963'>me. Would ye, madam, said Sir Launcelot, with your heart that I were</a>
<a id='line_28964'>with you? Yea, truly, said the queen. Now shall I prove my might, said</a>
<a id='line_28965'>Sir Launcelot, for your love; and then he set his hands upon the bars</a>
<a id='line_28966'>of iron, and he pulled at them with such a might that he brast them</a>
<a id='line_28967'>clean out of the stone walls, and therewithal one of the bars of iron</a>
<a id='line_28968'>cut the brawn of his hands throughout to the bone; and then he leapt</a>
<a id='line_28969'>into the chamber to the queen. Make ye no noise, said the queen, for my</a>
<a id='line_28970'>wounded knights lie here fast by me. So, to pass upon this tale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_28971'>Launcelot went unto bed with the queen, and he took no force of his</a>
<a id='line_28972'>hurt hand, but took his pleasaunce and his liking until it was in the</a>
<a id='line_28973'>dawning of the day; and wit ye well he slept not but watched, and when</a>
<a id='line_28974'>he saw his time that he might tarry no longer he took his leave and</a>
<a id='line_28975'>departed at the window, and put it together as well as he might again,</a>
<a id='line_28976'>and so departed unto his own chamber; and there he told Sir Lavaine how</a>
<a id='line_28977'>he was hurt. Then Sir Lavaine dressed his hand and staunched it, and</a>
<a id='line_28978'>put upon it a glove, that it should not be espied; and so the queen lay</a>
<a id='line_28979'>long in her bed until it was nine of the clock.</a>
<a id='line_28980'></a>
<a id='line_28981'>Then Sir Meliagrance went to the queen’s chamber, and found her ladies</a>
<a id='line_28982'>there ready clothed. Jesu mercy, said Sir Meliagrance, what aileth you,</a>
<a id='line_28983'>madam, that ye sleep thus long? And right therewithal he opened the</a>
<a id='line_28984'>curtain for to behold her; and then was he ware where she lay, and all</a>
<a id='line_28985'>the sheet and pillow was bebled with the blood of Sir Launcelot and of</a>
<a id='line_28986'>his hurt hand. When Sir Meliagrance espied that blood, then he deemed</a>
<a id='line_28987'>in her that she was false to the king, and that some of the wounded</a>
<a id='line_28988'>knights had lain by her all that night. Ah, madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_28989'>Meliagrance, now I have found you a false traitress unto my lord</a>
<a id='line_28990'>Arthur; for now I prove well it was not for nought that ye laid these</a>
<a id='line_28991'>wounded knights within the bounds of your chamber; therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_28992'>call you of treason before my lord, King Arthur. And now I have proved</a>
<a id='line_28993'>you, madam, with a shameful deed; and that they be all false, or some</a>
<a id='line_28994'>of them, I will make good, for a wounded knight this night hath lain by</a>
<a id='line_28995'>you. That is false, said the queen, and that I will report me unto them</a>
<a id='line_28996'>all. Then when the ten knights heard Sir Meliagrance’s words, they</a>
<a id='line_28997'>spake all in one voice and said to Sir Meliagrance: Thou sayest</a>
<a id='line_28998'>falsely, and wrongfully puttest upon us such a deed, and that we will</a>
<a id='line_28999'>make good any of us; choose which thou list of us when we are whole of</a>
<a id='line_29000'>our wounds. Ye shall not, said Sir Meliagrance, away with your proud</a>
<a id='line_29001'>language, for here ye may all see, said Sir Meliagrance, that by the</a>
<a id='line_29002'>queen this night a wounded knight hath lain. Then were they all ashamed</a>
<a id='line_29003'>when they saw that blood; and wit you well Sir Meliagrance was passing</a>
<a id='line_29004'>glad that he had the queen at such an advantage, for he deemed by that</a>
<a id='line_29005'>to hide his treason. So with this rumour came in Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_29006'>found them all at a great array.</a>
<a id='line_29007'></a>
<a id='line_29008'></a>
<a id='line_29009'></a>
<a id='line_29010'></a>
<a id='line_29011'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot answered for the queen, and waged battle</a>
<a id='line_29012'>against Sir Meliagrance; and how Sir Launcelot was taken in a trap.</a>
<a id='line_29013'></a>
<a id='line_29014'></a>
<a id='line_29015'>What array is this? said Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Meliagrance told them</a>
<a id='line_29016'>what he had found, and showed them the queen’s bed. Truly, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29017'>Launcelot, ye did not your part nor knightly, to touch a queen’s bed</a>
<a id='line_29018'>while it was drawn, and she lying therein; for I dare say my lord</a>
<a id='line_29019'>Arthur himself would not have displayed her curtains, she being within</a>
<a id='line_29020'>her bed, unless that it had pleased him to have lain down by her; and</a>
<a id='line_29021'>therefore ye have done unworshipfully and shamefully to yourself. I wot</a>
<a id='line_29022'>not what ye mean, said Sir Meliagrance, but well I am sure there hath</a>
<a id='line_29023'>one of her wounded knights lain by her this night, and therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_29024'>prove with my hands that she is a traitress unto my lord Arthur. Beware</a>
<a id='line_29025'>what ye do, said Launcelot, for an ye say so, an ye will prove it, it</a>
<a id='line_29026'>will be taken at your hands.</a>
<a id='line_29027'></a>
<a id='line_29028'>My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Sir Meliagrance, I rede you beware what ye</a>
<a id='line_29029'>do; for though ye are never so good a knight, as ye wot well ye are</a>
<a id='line_29030'>renowned the best knight of the world, yet should ye be advised to do</a>
<a id='line_29031'>battle in a wrong quarrel, for God will have a stroke in every battle.</a>
<a id='line_29032'>As for that, said Sir Launcelot, God is to be dread; but as to that I</a>
<a id='line_29033'>say nay plainly, that this night there lay none of these ten wounded</a>
<a id='line_29034'>knights with my lady Queen Guenever, and that will I prove with my</a>
<a id='line_29035'>hands, that ye say untruly in that now. Hold, said Sir Meliagrance,</a>
<a id='line_29036'>here is my glove that she is traitress unto my lord, King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_29037'>that this night one of the wounded knights lay with her. And I receive</a>
<a id='line_29038'>your glove, said Sir Launcelot. And so they were sealed with their</a>
<a id='line_29039'>signets, and delivered unto the ten knights. At what day shall we do</a>
<a id='line_29040'>battle together? said Sir Launcelot. This day eight days, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29041'>Meliagrance, in the field beside Westminster. I am agreed, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29042'>Launcelot. But now, said Sir Meliagrance, sithen it is so that we must</a>
<a id='line_29043'>fight together, I pray you, as ye be a noble knight, await me with no</a>
<a id='line_29044'>treason, nor none villainy the meanwhile, nor none for you. So God me</a>
<a id='line_29045'>help, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall right well wit I was never of no</a>
<a id='line_29046'>such conditions, for I report me to all knights that ever have known</a>
<a id='line_29047'>me, I fared never with no treason, nor I loved never the fellowship of</a>
<a id='line_29048'>no man that fared with treason. Then let us go to dinner, said</a>
<a id='line_29049'>Meliagrance, and after dinner ye and the queen and ye may ride all to</a>
<a id='line_29050'>Westminster. I will well, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_29051'></a>
<a id='line_29052'>Then Sir Meliagrance said to Sir Launcelot: Pleaseth it you to see the</a>
<a id='line_29053'>estures of this castle? With a good will, said Sir Launcelot. And then</a>
<a id='line_29054'>they went together from chamber to chamber, for Sir Launcelot dread no</a>
<a id='line_29055'>perils; for ever a man of worship and of prowess dreadeth least always</a>
<a id='line_29056'>perils, for they ween every man be as they be; but ever he that fareth</a>
<a id='line_29057'>with treason putteth oft a man in great danger. So it befell upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_29058'>Launcelot that no peril dread, as he went with Sir Meliagrance he trod</a>
<a id='line_29059'>on a trap and the board rolled, and there Sir Launcelot fell down more</a>
<a id='line_29060'>than ten fathom into a cave full of straw; and then Sir Meliagrance</a>
<a id='line_29061'>departed and made no fare as that he nist where he was.</a>
<a id='line_29062'></a>
<a id='line_29063'>And when Sir Launcelot was thus missed they marvelled where he was</a>
<a id='line_29064'>become; and then the queen and many of them deemed that he was departed</a>
<a id='line_29065'>as he was wont to do suddenly. For Sir Meliagrance made suddenly to put</a>
<a id='line_29066'>away aside Sir Lavaine’s horse, that they might all understand that Sir</a>
<a id='line_29067'>Launcelot was departed suddenly. So it passed on till after dinner; and</a>
<a id='line_29068'>then Sir Lavaine would not stint until that he ordained litters for the</a>
<a id='line_29069'>wounded knights, that they might be laid in them; and so with the queen</a>
<a id='line_29070'>and them all, both ladies and gentlewomen and other, went unto</a>
<a id='line_29071'>Westminster; and there the knights told King Arthur how Meliagrance had</a>
<a id='line_29072'>appealed the queen of high treason, and how Sir Launcelot had received</a>
<a id='line_29073'>the glove of him: And this day eight days they shall do battle afore</a>
<a id='line_29074'>you. By my head, said King Arthur, I am afeard Sir Meliagrance hath</a>
<a id='line_29075'>taken upon him a great charge; but where is Sir Launcelot? said the</a>
<a id='line_29076'>king. Sir, said they all, we wot not where he is, but we deem he is</a>
<a id='line_29077'>ridden to some adventures, as he is ofttimes wont to do, for he hath</a>
<a id='line_29078'>Sir Lavaine’s horse. Let him be, said the king, he will be founden, but</a>
<a id='line_29079'>if he be trapped with some treason.</a>
<a id='line_29080'></a>
<a id='line_29081'></a>
<a id='line_29082'></a>
<a id='line_29083'></a>
<a id='line_29084'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot was delivered out of prison by a lady,</a>
<a id='line_29085'>and took a white courser and came for to keep his day.</a>
<a id='line_29086'></a>
<a id='line_29087'></a>
<a id='line_29088'>So leave we Sir Launcelot lying within that cave in great pain; and</a>
<a id='line_29089'>every day there came a lady and brought him his meat and his drink, and</a>
<a id='line_29090'>wooed him, to have lain by him; and ever the noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29091'>Launcelot, said her nay. Sir Launcelot, said she, ye are not wise, for</a>
<a id='line_29092'>ye may never out of this prison, but if ye have my help; and also your</a>
<a id='line_29093'>lady, Queen Guenever, shall be brent in your default, unless that ye be</a>
<a id='line_29094'>there at the day of battle. God defend, said Sir Launcelot, that she</a>
<a id='line_29095'>should be brent in my default; and if it be so, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_29096'>that I may not be there, it shall be well understanded, both at the</a>
<a id='line_29097'>king and at the queen, and with all men of worship, that I am dead,</a>
<a id='line_29098'>sick, outher in prison. For all men that know me will say for me that I</a>
<a id='line_29099'>am in some evil case an I be not there that day; and well I wot there</a>
<a id='line_29100'>is some good knight either of my blood, or some other that loveth me,</a>
<a id='line_29101'>that will take my quarrel in hand; and therefore, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_29102'>wit ye well ye shall not fear me; and if there were no more women in</a>
<a id='line_29103'>all this land but ye, I will not have ado with you. Then art thou</a>
<a id='line_29104'>shamed, said the lady, and destroyed for ever. As for world’s shame,</a>
<a id='line_29105'>Jesu defend me, and as for my distress, it is welcome whatsoever it be</a>
<a id='line_29106'>that God sendeth me.</a>
<a id='line_29107'></a>
<a id='line_29108'>So she came to him the same day that the battle should be, and said:</a>
<a id='line_29109'>Sir Launcelot, methinketh ye are too hard-hearted, but wouldest thou</a>
<a id='line_29110'>but kiss me once I should deliver thee, and thine armour, and the best</a>
<a id='line_29111'>horse that is within Sir Meliagrance’s stable. As for to kiss you, said</a>
<a id='line_29112'>Sir Launcelot, I may do that and lose no worship; and wit ye well an I</a>
<a id='line_29113'>understood there were any disworship for to kiss you I would not do it.</a>
<a id='line_29114'>Then he kissed her, and then she gat him, and brought him to his</a>
<a id='line_29115'>armour. And when he was armed, she brought him to a stable, where stood</a>
<a id='line_29116'>twelve good coursers, and bade him choose the best. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29117'>looked upon a white courser the which liked him best; and anon he</a>
<a id='line_29118'>commanded the keepers fast to saddle him with the best saddle of war</a>
<a id='line_29119'>that there was; and so it was done as he bade. Then gat he his spear in</a>
<a id='line_29120'>his hand, and his sword by his side, and commended the lady unto God,</a>
<a id='line_29121'>and said: Lady, for this good deed I shall do you service if ever it be</a>
<a id='line_29122'>in my power.</a>
<a id='line_29123'></a>
<a id='line_29124'></a>
<a id='line_29125'></a>
<a id='line_29126'></a>
<a id='line_29127'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot came the same time that Sir Meliagrance</a>
<a id='line_29128'>abode him in the field and dressed him to battle.</a>
<a id='line_29129'></a>
<a id='line_29130'></a>
<a id='line_29131'>Now leave we Sir Launcelot wallop all that he might, and speak we of</a>
<a id='line_29132'>Queen Guenever that was brought to a fire to be brent; for Sir</a>
<a id='line_29133'>Meliagrance was sure, him thought, that Sir Launcelot should not be at</a>
<a id='line_29134'>that battle; therefore he ever cried upon King Arthur to do him</a>
<a id='line_29135'>justice, other-else bring forth Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then was the</a>
<a id='line_29136'>king and all the court full sore abashed and shamed that the queen</a>
<a id='line_29137'>should be brent in the default of Sir Launcelot. My lord Arthur, said</a>
<a id='line_29138'>Sir Lavaine, ye may understand that it is not well with my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_29139'>Launcelot, for an he were alive, so he be not sick outher in prison,</a>
<a id='line_29140'>wit ye well he would be here; for never heard ye that ever he failed</a>
<a id='line_29141'>his part for whom he should do battle for. And therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29142'>Lavaine, my lord, King Arthur, I beseech you give me license to do</a>
<a id='line_29143'>battle here this day for my lord and master, and for to save my lady,</a>
<a id='line_29144'>the queen. Gramercy gentle Sir Lavaine, said King Arthur, for I dare</a>
<a id='line_29145'>say all that Sir Meliagrance putteth upon my lady the queen is wrong,</a>
<a id='line_29146'>for I have spoken with all the ten wounded knights, and there is not</a>
<a id='line_29147'>one of them, an he were whole and able to do battle, but he would prove</a>
<a id='line_29148'>upon Sir Meliagrance’s body that it is false that he putteth upon my</a>
<a id='line_29149'>queen. So shall I, said Sir Lavaine, in the defence of my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29150'>Launcelot, an ye will give me leave. Now I give you leave, said King</a>
<a id='line_29151'>Arthur, and do your best, for I dare well say there is some treason</a>
<a id='line_29152'>done to Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_29153'></a>
<a id='line_29154'>Then was Sir Lavaine armed and horsed, and suddenly at the lists’ end</a>
<a id='line_29155'>he rode to perform this battle; and right as the heralds should cry:</a>
<a id='line_29156'>Lesses les aler, right so came in Sir Launcelot driving with all the</a>
<a id='line_29157'>force of his horse. And then Arthur cried: Ho! and Abide! Then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_29158'>Launcelot called on horseback to-fore King Arthur, and there he told</a>
<a id='line_29159'>openly to-fore the king and all, how Sir Meliagrance had served him</a>
<a id='line_29160'>first to last. And when the king, and the queen, and all the lords,</a>
<a id='line_29161'>knew of the treason of Sir Meliagrance they were all ashamed on his</a>
<a id='line_29162'>behalf. Then was Queen Guenever sent for, and set by the king in great</a>
<a id='line_29163'>trust of her champion. And then there was no more else to say, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_29164'>Launcelot and Sir Meliagrance dressed them unto battle, and took their</a>
<a id='line_29165'>spears; and so they came together as thunder, and there Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29166'>bare him down quite over his horse’s croup. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29167'>alighted and dressed his shield on his shoulder, with his sword in his</a>
<a id='line_29168'>hand, and Sir Meliagrance in the same wise dressed him unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_29169'>there they smote many great strokes together; and at the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_29170'>Launcelot smote him such a buffet upon the helmet that he fell on the</a>
<a id='line_29171'>one side to the earth. And then he cried upon him aloud: Most noble</a>
<a id='line_29172'>knight, Sir Launcelot du Lake, save my life, for I yield me unto you,</a>
<a id='line_29173'>and I require you, as ye be a knight and fellow of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_29174'>slay me not, for I yield me as overcome; and whether I shall live or</a>
<a id='line_29175'>die I put me in the king’s hands and yours.</a>
<a id='line_29176'></a>
<a id='line_29177'>Then Sir Launcelot wist not what to do, for he had had liefer than all</a>
<a id='line_29178'>the good of the world he might have been revenged upon Sir Meliagrance;</a>
<a id='line_29179'>and Sir Launcelot looked up to the Queen Guenever, if he might espy by</a>
<a id='line_29180'>any sign or countenance what she would have done. And then the queen</a>
<a id='line_29181'>wagged her head upon Sir Launcelot, as though she would say: Slay him.</a>
<a id='line_29182'>Full well knew Sir Launcelot by the wagging of her head that she would</a>
<a id='line_29183'>have him dead; then Sir Launcelot bade him rise for shame and perform</a>
<a id='line_29184'>that battle to the utterance. Nay, said Sir Meliagrance, I will never</a>
<a id='line_29185'>arise until ye take me as yolden and recreant. I shall proffer you</a>
<a id='line_29186'>large proffers, said Sir Launcelot, that is for to say, I shall unarm</a>
<a id='line_29187'>my head and my left quarter of my body, all that may be unarmed, and</a>
<a id='line_29188'>let bind my left hand behind me, so that it shall not help me, and</a>
<a id='line_29189'>right so I shall do battle with you. Then Sir Meliagrance started up</a>
<a id='line_29190'>upon his legs, and said on high: My lord Arthur, take heed to this</a>
<a id='line_29191'>proffer, for I will take it, and let him be disarmed and bounden</a>
<a id='line_29192'>according to his proffer. What say ye, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_29193'>Launcelot, will ye abide by your proffer? Yea, my lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29194'>Launcelot, I will never go from that I have once said.</a>
<a id='line_29195'></a>
<a id='line_29196'>Then the knights parters of the field disarmed Sir Launcelot, first his</a>
<a id='line_29197'>head, and sithen his left arm, and his left side, and they bound his</a>
<a id='line_29198'>left arm behind his back, without shield or anything, and then they</a>
<a id='line_29199'>were put together. Wit you well there was many a lady and knight</a>
<a id='line_29200'>marvelled that Sir Launcelot would jeopardy himself in such wise. Then</a>
<a id='line_29201'>Sir Meliagrance came with his sword all on high, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29202'>showed him openly his bare head and the bare left side; and when he</a>
<a id='line_29203'>weened to have smitten him upon the bare head, then lightly he avoided</a>
<a id='line_29204'>the left leg and the left side, and put his right hand and his sword to</a>
<a id='line_29205'>that stroke, and so put it on side with great sleight; and then with</a>
<a id='line_29206'>great force Sir Launcelot smote him on the helmet such a buffet that</a>
<a id='line_29207'>the stroke carved the head in two parts. Then there was no more to do,</a>
<a id='line_29208'>but he was drawn out of the field. And at the great instance of the</a>
<a id='line_29209'>knights of the Table Round, the king suffered him to be interred, and</a>
<a id='line_29210'>the mention made upon him, who slew him, and for what cause he was</a>
<a id='line_29211'>slain; and then the king and the queen made more of Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_29212'>Lake, and more he was cherished, than ever he was aforehand.</a>
<a id='line_29213'></a>
<a id='line_29214'></a>
<a id='line_29215'></a>
<a id='line_29216'></a>
<a id='line_29217'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Urre came into Arthur’s court for to be healed of</a>
<a id='line_29218'>his wounds, and how King Arthur would begin to handle him.</a>
<a id='line_29219'></a>
<a id='line_29220'></a>
<a id='line_29221'>Then as the French book maketh mention, there was a good knight in the</a>
<a id='line_29222'>land of Hungary, his name was Sir Urre, and he was an adventurous</a>
<a id='line_29223'>knight, and in all places where he might hear of any deeds of worship</a>
<a id='line_29224'>there would he be. So it happened in Spain there was an earl’s son, his</a>
<a id='line_29225'>name was Alphegus, and at a great tournament in Spain this Sir Urre,</a>
<a id='line_29226'>knight of Hungary, and Sir Alphegus of Spain encountered together for</a>
<a id='line_29227'>very envy; and so either undertook other to the utterance. And by</a>
<a id='line_29228'>fortune Sir Urre slew Sir Alphegus, the earl’s son of Spain, but this</a>
<a id='line_29229'>knight that was slain had given Sir Urre, or ever he was slain, seven</a>
<a id='line_29230'>great wounds, three on the head, and four on his body and upon his left</a>
<a id='line_29231'>hand. And this Sir Alphegus had a mother, the which was a great</a>
<a id='line_29232'>sorceress; and she, for the despite of her son’s death, wrought by her</a>
<a id='line_29233'>subtle crafts that Sir Urre should never be whole, but ever his wounds</a>
<a id='line_29234'>should one time fester and another time bleed, so that he should never</a>
<a id='line_29235'>be whole until the best knight of the world had searched his wounds;</a>
<a id='line_29236'>and thus she made her avaunt, wherethrough it was known that Sir Urre</a>
<a id='line_29237'>should never be whole.</a>
<a id='line_29238'></a>
<a id='line_29239'>Then his mother let make an horse litter, and put him therein under two</a>
<a id='line_29240'>palfreys; and then she took Sir Urre’s sister with him, a full fair</a>
<a id='line_29241'>damosel, whose name was Felelolie; and then she took a page with him to</a>
<a id='line_29242'>keep their horses, and so they led Sir Urre through many countries. For</a>
<a id='line_29243'>as the French book saith, she led him so seven year through all lands</a>
<a id='line_29244'>christened, and never she could find no knight that might ease her son.</a>
<a id='line_29245'>So she came into Scotland and into the lands of England, and by fortune</a>
<a id='line_29246'>she came nigh the feast of Pentecost until King Arthur’s court, that at</a>
<a id='line_29247'>that time was holden at Carlisle. And when she came there, then she</a>
<a id='line_29248'>made it openly to be known how that she was come into that land for to</a>
<a id='line_29249'>heal her son.</a>
<a id='line_29250'></a>
<a id='line_29251'>Then King Arthur let call that lady, and asked her the cause why she</a>
<a id='line_29252'>brought that hurt knight into that land. My most noble king, said that</a>
<a id='line_29253'>lady, wit you well I brought him hither for to be healed of his wounds,</a>
<a id='line_29254'>that of all this seven year he might not be whole. And then she told</a>
<a id='line_29255'>the king where he was wounded, and of whom; and how his mother had</a>
<a id='line_29256'>discovered in her pride how she had wrought that by enchantment, so</a>
<a id='line_29257'>that he should never be whole until the best knight of the world had</a>
<a id='line_29258'>searched his wounds. And so I have passed through all the lands</a>
<a id='line_29259'>christened to have him healed, except this land. And if I fail to heal</a>
<a id='line_29260'>him here in this land, I will never take more pain upon me, and that is</a>
<a id='line_29261'>pity, for he was a good knight, and of great nobleness. What is his</a>
<a id='line_29262'>name? said Arthur. My good and gracious lord, she said, his name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_29263'>Urre of the Mount. In good time, said the king, and sith ye are come</a>
<a id='line_29264'>into this land, ye are right welcome; and wit you well here shall your</a>
<a id='line_29265'>son be healed, an ever any Christian man may heal him. And for to give</a>
<a id='line_29266'>all other men of worship courage, I myself will assay to handle your</a>
<a id='line_29267'>son, and so shall all the kings, dukes, and earls that be here present</a>
<a id='line_29268'>with me at this time; thereto will I command them, and well I wot they</a>
<a id='line_29269'>shall obey and do after my commandment. And wit you well, said King</a>
<a id='line_29270'>Arthur unto Urre’s sister, I shall begin to handle him, and search unto</a>
<a id='line_29271'>my power, not presuming upon me that I am so worthy to heal your son by</a>
<a id='line_29272'>my deeds, but I will courage other men of worship to do as I will do.</a>
<a id='line_29273'>And then the king commanded all the kings, dukes, and earls, and all</a>
<a id='line_29274'>noble knights of the Round Table that were there that time present, to</a>
<a id='line_29275'>come into the meadow of Carlisle. And so at that time there were but an</a>
<a id='line_29276'>hundred and ten of the Round Table, for forty knights were that time</a>
<a id='line_29277'>away; and so here we must begin at King Arthur, as is kindly to begin</a>
<a id='line_29278'>at him that was the most man of worship that was christened at that</a>
<a id='line_29279'>time.</a>
<a id='line_29280'></a>
<a id='line_29281'></a>
<a id='line_29282'></a>
<a id='line_29283'></a>
<a id='line_29284'>CHAPTER XI. How King Arthur handled Sir Urre, and after him many other</a>
<a id='line_29285'>knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_29286'></a>
<a id='line_29287'></a>
<a id='line_29288'>Then King Arthur looked upon Sir Urre, and the king thought he was a</a>
<a id='line_29289'>full likely man when he was whole; and then King Arthur made him to be</a>
<a id='line_29290'>taken down off the litter and laid him upon the earth, and there was</a>
<a id='line_29291'>laid a cushion of gold that he should kneel upon. And then noble Arthur</a>
<a id='line_29292'>said: Fair knight, me repenteth of thy hurt, and for to courage all</a>
<a id='line_29293'>other noble knights I will pray thee softly to suffer me to handle your</a>
<a id='line_29294'>wounds. Most noble christened king, said Urre, do as ye list, for I am</a>
<a id='line_29295'>at the mercy of God, and at your commandment. So then Arthur softly</a>
<a id='line_29296'>handled him, and then some of his wounds renewed upon bleeding. Then</a>
<a id='line_29297'>the King Clarence of Northumberland searched, and it would not be. And</a>
<a id='line_29298'>then Sir Barant le Apres that was called the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_29299'>Knights, he assayed and failed; and so did King Uriens of the land of</a>
<a id='line_29300'>Gore; so did King Anguish of Ireland; so did King Nentres of Garloth;</a>
<a id='line_29301'>so did King Carados of Scotland; so did the Duke Galahad, the haut</a>
<a id='line_29302'>prince; so did Constantine, that was Sir Carados’ son of Cornwall; so</a>
<a id='line_29303'>did Duke Chaleins of Clarance; so did the Earl Ulbause; so did the Earl</a>
<a id='line_29304'>Lambaile; so did the Earl Aristause.</a>
<a id='line_29305'></a>
<a id='line_29306'>Then came in Sir Gawaine with his three sons, Sir Gingalin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29307'>Florence, and Sir Lovel, these two were begotten upon Sir Brandiles’</a>
<a id='line_29308'>sister; and all they failed. Then came in Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_29309'>Sir Mordred, and the good knight, Sir Gareth, that was of very</a>
<a id='line_29310'>knighthood worth all the brethren. So came knights of Launcelot’s kin,</a>
<a id='line_29311'>but Sir Launcelot was not that time in the court, for he was that time</a>
<a id='line_29312'>upon his adventures. Then Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de</a>
<a id='line_29313'>Ganis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine,</a>
<a id='line_29314'>Sir Galihodin, Sir Menaduke, Sir Villiars the Valiant, Sir Hebes le</a>
<a id='line_29315'>Renoumes. All these were of Sir Launcelot’s kin, and all they failed.</a>
<a id='line_29316'>Then came in Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29317'>Dinadan, Sir Bruin le Noire, that Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile, and</a>
<a id='line_29318'>Sir Kay le Seneschal, Sir Kay de Stranges, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29319'>Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion of the</a>
<a id='line_29320'>Mountain, Sir Cardok, Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and Sir Ozanna le Cure</a>
<a id='line_29321'>Hardy.</a>
<a id='line_29322'></a>
<a id='line_29323'>Then came in Sir Astamor, and Sir Gromere, Grummor’s son, Sir Crosselm,</a>
<a id='line_29324'>Sir Servause le Breuse, that was called a passing strong knight, for as</a>
<a id='line_29325'>the book saith, the chief Lady of the Lake feasted Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_29326'>Servause le Breuse, and when she had feasted them both at sundry times</a>
<a id='line_29327'>she prayed them to give her a boon. And they granted it her. And then</a>
<a id='line_29328'>she prayed Sir Servause that he would promise her never to do battle</a>
<a id='line_29329'>against Sir Launcelot du Lake, and in the same wise she prayed Sir</a>
<a id='line_29330'>Launcelot never to do battle against Sir Servause, and so either</a>
<a id='line_29331'>promised her. For the French book saith, that Sir Servause had never</a>
<a id='line_29332'>courage nor lust to do battle against no man, but if it were against</a>
<a id='line_29333'>giants, and against dragons, and wild beasts. So we pass unto them that</a>
<a id='line_29334'>at the king’s request made them all that were there at that high feast,</a>
<a id='line_29335'>as of the knights of the Table Round, for to search Sir Urre: to that</a>
<a id='line_29336'>intent the king did it, to wit which was the noblest knight among them.</a>
<a id='line_29337'></a>
<a id='line_29338'>Then came Sir Aglovale, Sir Durnore, Sir Tor, that was begotten upon</a>
<a id='line_29339'>Aries, the cowherd’s wife, but he was begotten afore Aries wedded her,</a>
<a id='line_29340'>and King Pellinore begat them all, first Sir Tor, Sir Aglovale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29341'>Durnore, Sir Lamorak, the most noblest knight one that ever was in</a>
<a id='line_29342'>Arthur’s days as for a worldly knight, and Sir Percivale that was</a>
<a id='line_29343'>peerless except Sir Galahad in holy deeds, but they died in the quest</a>
<a id='line_29344'>of the Sangreal. Then came Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Lucan the</a>
<a id='line_29345'>Butler, Sir Bedevere his brother, Sir Brandiles, Sir Constantine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29346'>Cador’s son of Cornwall, that was king after Arthur’s days, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_29347'>Clegis, Sir Sadok, Sir Dinas le Seneschal of Cornwall, Sir Fergus, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29348'>Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Clarrus of Cleremont, Sir Cloddrus, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29349'>Hectimere, Sir Edward of Carnarvon, Sir Dinas, Sir Priamus, that was</a>
<a id='line_29350'>christened by Sir Tristram the noble knight, and these three were</a>
<a id='line_29351'>brethren; Sir Hellaine le Blank that was son to Sir Bors, he begat him</a>
<a id='line_29352'>upon King Brandegoris’ daughter, and Sir Brian de Listinoise; Sir</a>
<a id='line_29353'>Gautere, Sir Reynold, Sir Gillemere, were three brethren that Sir</a>
<a id='line_29354'>Launcelot won upon a bridge in Sir Kay’s arms. Sir Guyart le Petite,</a>
<a id='line_29355'>Sir Bellangere le Beuse, that was son to the good knight, Sir Alisander</a>
<a id='line_29356'>le Orphelin, that was slain by the treason of King Mark. Also that</a>
<a id='line_29357'>traitor king slew the noble knight Sir Tristram, as he sat harping</a>
<a id='line_29358'>afore his lady La Beale Isoud, with a trenchant glaive, for whose death</a>
<a id='line_29359'>was much bewailing of every knight that ever were in Arthur’s days;</a>
<a id='line_29360'>there was never none so bewailed as was Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_29361'>for they were traitorously slain, Sir Tristram by King Mark, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_29362'>Lamorak by Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And this Sir Bellangere</a>
<a id='line_29363'>revenged the death of his father Alisander, and Sir Tristram slew King</a>
<a id='line_29364'>Mark, and La Beale Isoud died swooning upon the corse of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_29365'>whereof was great pity. And all that were with King Mark that were</a>
<a id='line_29366'>consenting to the death of Sir Tristram were slain, as Sir Andred and</a>
<a id='line_29367'>many other.</a>
<a id='line_29368'></a>
<a id='line_29369'>Then came Sir Hebes, Sir Morganore, Sir Sentraile, Sir Suppinabilis,</a>
<a id='line_29370'>Sir Bellangere le Orgulous, that the good knight Sir Lamorak won in</a>
<a id='line_29371'>plain battle; Sir Neroveus and Sir Plenorius, two good knights that Sir</a>
<a id='line_29372'>Launcelot won; Sir Darras, Sir Harry le Fise Lake, Sir Erminide,</a>
<a id='line_29373'>brother to King Hermaunce, for whom Sir Palomides fought at the Red</a>
<a id='line_29374'>City with two brethren; and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29375'>Edward of Orkney, Sir Ironside, that was called the noble Knight of the</a>

<a id='line_29378'>the black lowe, Sir Epinogris, that was the king’s son of</a>
<a id='line_29379'>Northumberland. Sir Pelleas that loved the lady Ettard, and he had died</a>
<a id='line_29380'>for her love had not been one of the ladies of the lake, her name was</a>
<a id='line_29381'>Dame Nimue, and she wedded Sir Pelleas, and she saved him that he was</a>
<a id='line_29382'>never slain, and he was a full noble knight; and Sir Lamiel of Cardiff</a>
<a id='line_29383'>that was a great lover. Sir Plaine de Fors, Sir Melleaus de Lile, Sir</a>

<a id='line_29385'>Sir Colgrevance, Sir Hervise de la Forest Savage, Sir Marrok, the good</a>

<a id='line_29387'>wer-wolf, Sir Persaunt, Sir Pertilope, his brother, that was called the</a>
<a id='line_29388'>Green Knight, and Sir Perimones, brother to them both, that was called</a>
<a id='line_29389'>the Red Knight, that Sir Gareth won when he was called Beaumains. All</a>
<a id='line_29390'>these hundred knights and ten searched Sir Urre’s wounds by the</a>
<a id='line_29391'>commandment of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_29392'></a>

<a id='line_29395'></a>
<a id='line_29396'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot was commanded by Arthur to handle his</a>
<a id='line_29397'>wounds, and anon he was all whole, and how they thanked God.</a>
<a id='line_29398'></a>
<a id='line_29399'></a>
<a id='line_29400'>Mercy Jesu, said King Arthur, where is Sir Launcelot du Lake that he is</a>
<a id='line_29401'>not here at this time? Thus, as they stood and spake of many things,</a>
<a id='line_29402'>there was espied Sir Launcelot that came riding toward them, and told</a>
<a id='line_29403'>the king. Peace, said the king, let no manner thing be said until he be</a>
<a id='line_29404'>come to us. So when Sir Launcelot espied King Arthur, he descended from</a>
<a id='line_29405'>his horse and came to the king, and saluted him and them all. Anon as</a>
<a id='line_29406'>the maid, Sir Urre’s sister, saw Sir Launcelot, she ran to her brother</a>
<a id='line_29407'>thereas he lay in his litter, and said: Brother, here is come a knight</a>
<a id='line_29408'>that my heart giveth greatly unto. Fair sister, said Sir Urre, so doth</a>
<a id='line_29409'>my heart light against him, and certainly I hope now to be healed, for</a>
<a id='line_29410'>my heart giveth unto him more than to all these that have searched me.</a>
<a id='line_29411'></a>
<a id='line_29412'>Then said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot: Ye must do as we have done; and</a>
<a id='line_29413'>told Sir Launcelot what they had done, and showed him them all, that</a>
<a id='line_29414'>had searched him. Jesu defend me, said Sir Launcelot, when so many</a>
<a id='line_29415'>kings and knights have assayed and failed, that I should presume upon</a>
<a id='line_29416'>me to enchieve that all ye, my lords, might not enchieve. Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_29417'>choose, said King Arthur, for I will command you for to do as we all</a>
<a id='line_29418'>have done. My most renowned lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye know well I</a>
<a id='line_29419'>dare not nor may not disobey your commandment, but an I might or durst,</a>
<a id='line_29420'>wit you well I would not take upon me to touch that wounded knight in</a>
<a id='line_29421'>that intent that I should pass all other knights; Jesu defend me from</a>
<a id='line_29422'>that shame. Ye take it wrong, said King Arthur, ye shall not do it for</a>
<a id='line_29423'>no presumption, but for to bear us fellowship, insomuch ye be a fellow</a>
<a id='line_29424'>of the Table Round; and wit you well, said King Arthur, an ye prevail</a>
<a id='line_29425'>not and heal him, I dare say there is no knight in this land may heal</a>
<a id='line_29426'>him, and therefore I pray you, do as we have done.</a>
<a id='line_29427'></a>
<a id='line_29428'>And then all the kings and knights for the most part prayed Sir</a>
<a id='line_29429'>Launcelot to search him; and then the wounded knight, Sir Urre, set him</a>
<a id='line_29430'>up weakly, and prayed Sir Launcelot heartily, saying: Courteous knight,</a>
<a id='line_29431'>I require thee for God’s sake heal my wounds, for methinketh ever</a>
<a id='line_29432'>sithen ye came here my wounds grieve me not. Ah, my fair lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29433'>Launcelot, Jesu would that I might help you; I shame me sore that I</a>
<a id='line_29434'>should be thus rebuked, for never was I able in worthiness to do so</a>
<a id='line_29435'>high a thing. Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down by the wounded knight</a>
<a id='line_29436'>saying: My lord Arthur, I must do your commandment, the which is sore</a>
<a id='line_29437'>against my heart. And then he held up his hands, and looked into the</a>
<a id='line_29438'>east, saying secretly unto himself: Thou blessed Father, Son, and Holy</a>
<a id='line_29439'>Ghost, I beseech thee of thy mercy, that my simple worship and honesty</a>
<a id='line_29440'>be saved, and thou blessed Trinity, thou mayst give power to heal this</a>
<a id='line_29441'>sick knight by thy great virtue and grace of thee, but, Good Lord,</a>
<a id='line_29442'>never of myself. And then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Urre to let him see</a>
<a id='line_29443'>his head; and then devoutly kneeling he ransacked the three wounds,</a>
<a id='line_29444'>that they bled a little, and forthwith all the wounds fair healed, and</a>
<a id='line_29445'>seemed as they had been whole a seven year. And in likewise he searched</a>
<a id='line_29446'>his body of other three wounds, and they healed in likewise; and then</a>
<a id='line_29447'>the last of all he searched the which was in his hand, and anon it</a>
<a id='line_29448'>healed fair.</a>
<a id='line_29449'></a>
<a id='line_29450'>Then King Arthur and all the kings and knights kneeled down and gave</a>
<a id='line_29451'>thankings and lovings unto God and to His Blessed Mother. And ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_29452'>Launcelot wept as he had been a child that had been beaten. Then King</a>
<a id='line_29453'>Arthur let array priests and clerks in the most devoutest manner, to</a>
<a id='line_29454'>bring in Sir Urre within Carlisle, with singing and loving to God. And</a>
<a id='line_29455'>when this was done, the king let clothe him in the richest manner that</a>
<a id='line_29456'>could be thought; and then were there but few better made knights in</a>
<a id='line_29457'>all the court, for he was passingly well made and bigly; and Arthur</a>
<a id='line_29458'>asked Sir Urre how he felt himself. My good lord, he said, I felt</a>
<a id='line_29459'>myself never so lusty. Will ye joust and do deeds of arms? said King</a>
<a id='line_29460'>Arthur. Sir, said Urre, an I had all that longed unto jousts I would be</a>
<a id='line_29461'>soon ready.</a>
<a id='line_29462'></a>
<a id='line_29463'></a>
<a id='line_29464'></a>
<a id='line_29465'></a>
<a id='line_29466'>CHAPTER XIII. How there was a party made of an hundred knights against</a>
<a id='line_29467'>an hundred knights, and of other matters.</a>
<a id='line_29468'></a>
<a id='line_29469'></a>
<a id='line_29470'>Then Arthur made a party of hundred knights to be against an hundred</a>
<a id='line_29471'>knights. And so upon the morn they jousted for a diamond, but there</a>
<a id='line_29472'>jousted none of the dangerous knights; and so for to shorten this tale,</a>
<a id='line_29473'>Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine jousted best that day, for there was none of</a>
<a id='line_29474'>them but he overthrew and pulled down thirty knights; and then by the</a>
<a id='line_29475'>assent of all the kings and lords, Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine were made</a>
<a id='line_29476'>knights of the Table Round. And Sir Lavaine cast his love unto Dame</a>
<a id='line_29477'>Felelolie, Sir Urre’s sister, and then they were wedded together with</a>
<a id='line_29478'>great joy, and King Arthur gave to everych of them a barony of lands.</a>
<a id='line_29479'>And this Sir Urre would never go from Sir Launcelot, but he and Sir</a>
<a id='line_29480'>Lavaine awaited evermore upon him; and they were in all the court</a>
<a id='line_29481'>accounted for good knights, and full desirous in arms; and many noble</a>
<a id='line_29482'>deeds they did, for they would have no rest, but ever sought</a>
<a id='line_29483'>adventures.</a>
<a id='line_29484'></a>
<a id='line_29485'>Thus they lived in all that court with great noblesse and joy long</a>
<a id='line_29486'>time. But every night and day Sir Agravaine, Sir Gawaine’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_29487'>awaited Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot du Lake to put them to a</a>
<a id='line_29488'>rebuke and shame. And so I leave here of this tale, and overskip great</a>
<a id='line_29489'>books of Sir Launcelot du Lake, what great adventures he did when he</a>
<a id='line_29490'>was called Le Chevaler du Chariot. For as the French book saith,</a>
<a id='line_29491'>because of despite that knights and ladies called him the knight that</a>
<a id='line_29492'>rode in the chariot like as he were judged to the gallows, therefore in</a>
<a id='line_29493'>despite of all them that named him so, he was carried in a chariot a</a>
<a id='line_29494'>twelvemonth, for, but little after that he had slain Sir Meliagrance in</a>
<a id='line_29495'>the queen’s quarrel, he never in a twelvemonth came on horseback. And</a>
<a id='line_29496'>as the French book saith, he did that twelvemonth more than forty</a>
<a id='line_29497'>battles. And because I have lost the very matter of Le Chevaier du</a>
<a id='line_29498'>Chariot, I depart from the tale of Sir Launcelot, and here I go unto</a>
<a id='line_29499'>the morte of King Arthur; and that caused Sir Agravaine.</a>

<a id='line_29512'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred were busy upon Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_29513'>for to disclose the love between Sir Launcelot and Queen Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_29514'></a>
<a id='line_29515'></a>
<a id='line_29516'>In May when every lusty heart flourisheth and bourgeoneth, for as the</a>
<a id='line_29517'>season is lusty to behold and comfortable, so man and woman rejoice and</a>
<a id='line_29518'>gladden of summer coming with his fresh flowers: for winter with his</a>
<a id='line_29519'>rough winds and blasts causeth a lusty man and woman to cower and sit</a>
<a id='line_29520'>fast by the fire. So in this season, as in the month of May, it befell</a>
<a id='line_29521'>a great anger and unhap that stinted not till the flower of chivalry of</a>
<a id='line_29522'>all the world was destroyed and slain; and all was long upon two</a>
<a id='line_29523'>unhappy knights the which were named Agravaine and Sir Mordred, that</a>
<a id='line_29524'>were brethren unto Sir Gawaine. For this Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred</a>
<a id='line_29525'>had ever a privy hate unto the queen Dame Guenever and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_29526'>Launcelot, and daily and nightly they ever watched upon Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_29527'></a>
<a id='line_29528'>So it mishapped, Sir Gawaine and all his brethren were in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_29529'>chamber; and then Sir Agravaine said thus openly, and not in no</a>
<a id='line_29530'>counsel, that many knights might hear it: I marvel that we all be not</a>
<a id='line_29531'>ashamed both to see and to know how Sir Launcelot lieth daily and</a>
<a id='line_29532'>nightly by the queen, and all we know it so; and it is shamefully</a>
<a id='line_29533'>suffered of us all, that we all should suffer so noble a king as King</a>
<a id='line_29534'>Arthur is so to be shamed.</a>
<a id='line_29535'></a>
<a id='line_29536'>Then spake Sir Gawaine, and said: Brother Sir Agravaine, I pray you and</a>
<a id='line_29537'>charge you move no such matters no more afore me, for wit you well,</a>
<a id='line_29538'>said Sir Gawaine, I will not be of your counsel. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_29539'>Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth, we will not be knowing, brother Agravaine,</a>
<a id='line_29540'>of your deeds. Then will I, said Sir Mordred. I lieve well that, said</a>
<a id='line_29541'>Sir Gawaine, for ever unto all unhappiness, brother Sir Mordred,</a>
<a id='line_29542'>thereto will ye grant; and I would that ye left all this, and made you</a>
<a id='line_29543'>not so busy, for I know, said Sir Gawaine, what will fall of it. Fall</a>
<a id='line_29544'>of it what fall may, said Sir Agravaine, I will disclose it to the</a>
<a id='line_29545'>king. Not by my counsel, said Sir Gawaine, for an there rise war and</a>
<a id='line_29546'>wrack betwixt Sir Launcelot and us, wit you well brother, there will</a>
<a id='line_29547'>many kings and great lords hold with Sir Launcelot. Also, brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_29548'>Agravaine, said Sir Gawaine, ye must remember how ofttimes Sir</a>
<a id='line_29549'>Launcelot hath rescued the king and the queen; and the best of us all</a>
<a id='line_29550'>had been full cold at the heart-root had not Sir Launcelot been better</a>
<a id='line_29551'>than we, and that hath he proved himself full oft. And as for my part,</a>
<a id='line_29552'>said Sir Gawaine, I will never be against Sir Launcelot for one day’s</a>
<a id='line_29553'>deed, when he rescued me from King Carados of the Dolorous Tower, and</a>
<a id='line_29554'>slew him, and saved my life. Also, brother Sir Agravaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_29555'>Mordred, in like wise Sir Launcelot rescued you both, and threescore</a>
<a id='line_29556'>and two, from Sir Turquin. Methinketh brother, such kind deeds and</a>
<a id='line_29557'>kindness should be remembered. Do as ye list, said Sir Agravaine, for I</a>
<a id='line_29558'>will lain it no longer. With these words came to them King Arthur. Now</a>
<a id='line_29559'>brother, stint your noise, said Sir Gawaine. We will not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29560'>Agravaine and Sir Mordred. Will ye so? said Sir Gawaine; then God speed</a>
<a id='line_29561'>you, for I will not hear your tales ne be of your counsel. No more will</a>
<a id='line_29562'>I, said Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris, for we will never say evil by that</a>
<a id='line_29563'>man; for because, said Sir Gareth, Sir Launcelot made me knight, by no</a>
<a id='line_29564'>manner owe I to say ill of him: and therewithal they three departed,</a>
<a id='line_29565'>making great dole. Alas, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Gareth, now is this</a>
<a id='line_29566'>realm wholly mischieved, and the noble fellowship of the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_29567'>shall be disparpled: so they departed.</a>
<a id='line_29568'></a>
<a id='line_29569'></a>
<a id='line_29570'></a>
<a id='line_29571'></a>
<a id='line_29572'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Agravaine disclosed their love to King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_29573'>how King Arthur gave them licence to take him.</a>
<a id='line_29574'></a>
<a id='line_29575'></a>
<a id='line_29576'>And then Sir Arthur asked them what noise they made. My lord, said</a>
<a id='line_29577'>Agravaine, I shall tell you that I may keep no longer. Here is I, and</a>
<a id='line_29578'>my brother Sir Mordred, brake unto my brothers Sir Gawaine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29579'>Gaheris, and to Sir Gareth, how this we know all, that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29580'>holdeth your queen, and hath done long; and we be your sister’s sons,</a>
<a id='line_29581'>and we may suffer it no longer, and all we wot that ye should be above</a>
<a id='line_29582'>Sir Launcelot; and ye are the king that made him knight, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_29583'>we will prove it, that he is a traitor to your person.</a>
<a id='line_29584'></a>
<a id='line_29585'>If it be so, said Sir Arthur, wit you well he is none other, but I</a>
<a id='line_29586'>would be loath to begin such a thing but I might have proofs upon it;</a>
<a id='line_29587'>for Sir Launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best</a>
<a id='line_29588'>knight among us all; and but if he be taken with the deed, he will</a>
<a id='line_29589'>fight with him that bringeth up the noise, and I know no knight that is</a>
<a id='line_29590'>able to match him. Therefore an it be sooth as ye say, I would he were</a>
<a id='line_29591'>taken with the deed. For as the French book saith, the king was full</a>
<a id='line_29592'>loath thereto, that any noise should be upon Sir Launcelot and his</a>
<a id='line_29593'>queen; for the king had a deeming, but he would not hear of it, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_29594'>Launcelot had done so much for him and the queen so many times, that</a>
<a id='line_29595'>wit ye well the king loved him passingly well. My lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29596'>Agravaine, ye shall ride to-morn a-hunting, and doubt ye not Sir</a>
<a id='line_29597'>Launcelot will not go with you. Then when it draweth toward night, ye</a>
<a id='line_29598'>may send the queen word that ye will lie out all that night, and so may</a>
<a id='line_29599'>ye send for your cooks, and then upon pain of death we shall take him</a>
<a id='line_29600'>that night with the queen, and outher we shall bring him to you dead or</a>
<a id='line_29601'>quick. I will well, said the king; then I counsel you, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_29602'>take with you sure fellowship. Sir, said Agravaine, my brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29603'>Mordred, and I, will take with us twelve knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_29604'>Beware, said King Arthur, for I warn you ye shall find him wight. Let</a>
<a id='line_29605'>us deal, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_29606'></a>
<a id='line_29607'>So on the morn King Arthur rode a-hunting, and sent word to the queen</a>
<a id='line_29608'>that he would be out all that night. Then Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred</a>
<a id='line_29609'>gat to them twelve knights, and hid themself in a chamber in the Castle</a>
<a id='line_29610'>of Carlisle, and these were their names: Sir Colgrevance, Sir Mador de</a>
<a id='line_29611'>la Porte, Sir Gingaline, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir Petipase of</a>
<a id='line_29612'>Winchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion of the Mountain, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29613'>Astamore, Sir Gromore Somir Joure, Sir Curselaine, Sir Florence, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29614'>Lovel. So these twelve knights were with Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine,</a>
<a id='line_29615'>and all they were of Scotland, outher of Sir Gawaine’s kin, either</a>
<a id='line_29616'>well-willers to his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_29617'></a>
<a id='line_29618'>So when the night came, Sir Launcelot told Sir Bors how he would go</a>
<a id='line_29619'>that night and speak with the queen. Sir, said Sir Bors, ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_29620'>go this night by my counsel. Why? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29621'>Bors, I dread me ever of Sir Agravaine, that waiteth you daily to do</a>
<a id='line_29622'>you shame and us all; and never gave my heart against no going, that</a>
<a id='line_29623'>ever ye went to the queen, so much as now; for I mistrust that the king</a>
<a id='line_29624'>is out this night from the queen because peradventure he hath lain some</a>
<a id='line_29625'>watch for you and the queen, and therefore I dread me sore of treason.</a>
<a id='line_29626'>Have ye no dread, said Sir Launcelot, for I shall go and come again,</a>
<a id='line_29627'>and make no tarrying. Sir, said Sir Bors, that me repenteth, for I</a>
<a id='line_29628'>dread me sore that your going out this night shall wrath us all. Fair</a>
<a id='line_29629'>nephew, said Sir Launcelot, I marvel much why ye say thus, sithen the</a>
<a id='line_29630'>queen hath sent for me; and wit ye well I will not be so much a coward,</a>
<a id='line_29631'>but she shall understand I will see her good grace. God speed you well,</a>
<a id='line_29632'>said Sir Bors, and send you sound and safe again.</a>
<a id='line_29633'></a>
<a id='line_29634'></a>

<a id='line_29637'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot was espied in the queen’s chamber, and</a>
<a id='line_29638'>how Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred came with twelve knights to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_29639'></a>
<a id='line_29640'></a>
<a id='line_29641'>So Sir Launcelot departed, and took his sword under his arm, and so in</a>
<a id='line_29642'>his mantle that noble knight put himself in great Jeopardy; and so he</a>
<a id='line_29643'>passed till he came to the queen’s chamber, and then Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_29644'>lightly put into the chamber. And then, as the French book saith, the</a>
<a id='line_29645'>queen and Launcelot were together. And whether they were abed or at</a>
<a id='line_29646'>other manner of disports, me list not hereof make no mention, for love</a>
<a id='line_29647'>that time was not as is now-a-days. But thus as they were together,</a>
<a id='line_29648'>there came Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, with twelve knights with them</a>
<a id='line_29649'>of the Round Table, and they said with crying voice: Traitor-knight,</a>
<a id='line_29650'>Sir Launcelot du Lake, now art thou taken. And thus they cried with a</a>
<a id='line_29651'>loud voice, that all the court might hear it; and they all fourteen</a>
<a id='line_29652'>were armed at all points as they should fight in a battle. Alas said</a>
<a id='line_29653'>Queen Guenever, now are we mischieved both Madam, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_29654'>is there here any armour within your chamber, that I might cover my</a>
<a id='line_29655'>poor body withal? An if there be any give it me, and I shall soon stint</a>
<a id='line_29656'>their malice, by the grace of God. Truly, said the queen, I have none</a>
<a id='line_29657'>armour, shield, sword, nor spear; wherefore I dread me sore our long</a>
<a id='line_29658'>love is come to a mischievous end, for I hear by their noise there be</a>
<a id='line_29659'>many noble knights, and well I wot they be surely armed, and against</a>
<a id='line_29660'>them ye may make no resistance. Wherefore ye are likely to be slain,</a>
<a id='line_29661'>and then shall I be brent. For an ye might escape them, said the queen,</a>
<a id='line_29662'>I would not doubt but that ye would rescue me in what danger that ever</a>
<a id='line_29663'>I stood in. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, in all my life thus was I never</a>
<a id='line_29664'>bestead, that I should be thus shamefully slain for lack of mine</a>
<a id='line_29665'>armour.</a>
<a id='line_29666'></a>
<a id='line_29667'>But ever in one Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred cried: Traitor-knight,</a>
<a id='line_29668'>come out of the queen’s chamber, for wit thou well thou art so beset</a>
<a id='line_29669'>that thou shalt not escape. O Jesu mercy, said Sir Launcelot, this</a>
<a id='line_29670'>shameful cry and noise I may not suffer, for better were death at once</a>
<a id='line_29671'>than thus to endure this pain. Then he took the queen in his arms, and</a>
<a id='line_29672'>kissed her, and said: Most noble Christian queen, I beseech you as ye</a>
<a id='line_29673'>have been ever my special good lady, and I at all times your true poor</a>
<a id='line_29674'>knight unto my power, and as I never failed you in right nor in wrong</a>
<a id='line_29675'>sithen the first day King Arthur made me knight, that ye will pray for</a>
<a id='line_29676'>my soul if that I here be slain; for well I am assured that Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_29677'>my nephew, and all the remnant of my kin, with Sir Lavaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_29678'>Urre, that they will not fail you to rescue you from the fire; and</a>
<a id='line_29679'>therefore, mine own lady, recomfort yourself, whatsomever come of me,</a>
<a id='line_29680'>that ye go with Sir Bors, my nephew, and Sir Urre, and they all will do</a>
<a id='line_29681'>you all the pleasure that they can or may, that ye shall live like a</a>
<a id='line_29682'>queen upon my lands. Nay, Launcelot, said the queen, wit thou well I</a>
<a id='line_29683'>will never live after thy days, but an thou be slain I will take my</a>
<a id='line_29684'>death as meekly for Jesu Christ’s sake as ever did any Christian queen.</a>
<a id='line_29685'>Well, madam, said I-auncelot, sith it is so that the day is come that</a>
<a id='line_29686'>our love must depart, wit you well I shall sell my life as dear as I</a>
<a id='line_29687'>may; and a thousandfold, said Sir Launcelot, I am more heavier for you</a>
<a id='line_29688'>than for myself. And now I had liefer than to be lord of all</a>
<a id='line_29689'>Christendom, that I had sure armour upon me, that men might speak of my</a>
<a id='line_29690'>deeds or ever I were slain. Truly, said the queen, I would an it might</a>
<a id='line_29691'>please God that they would take me and slay me, and suffer you to</a>
<a id='line_29692'>escape. That shall never be, said Sir Launcelot, God defend me from</a>
<a id='line_29693'>such a shame, but Jesu be Thou my shield and mine armour!</a>
<a id='line_29694'></a>
<a id='line_29695'></a>
<a id='line_29696'></a>
<a id='line_29697'></a>
<a id='line_29698'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot slew Sir Colgrevance, and armed him in</a>
<a id='line_29699'>his harness, and after slew Sir Agravaine, and twelve of his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_29700'></a>
<a id='line_29701'></a>
<a id='line_29702'>And therewith Sir Launcelot wrapped his mantle about his arm well and</a>
<a id='line_29703'>surely; and by then they had gotten a great form out of the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_29704'>therewithal they rashed at the door. Fair lords, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_29705'>leave your noise and your rashing, and I shall set open this door, and</a>
<a id='line_29706'>then may ye do with me what it liketh you. Come off then, said they</a>
<a id='line_29707'>all, and do it, for it availeth thee not to strive against us all; and</a>
<a id='line_29708'>therefore let us into this chamber, and we shall save thy life until</a>
<a id='line_29709'>thou come to King Arthur. Then Launcelot unbarred the door, and with</a>
<a id='line_29710'>his left hand he held it open a little, so that but one man might come</a>
<a id='line_29711'>in at once; and so there came striding a good knight, a much man and</a>
<a id='line_29712'>large, and his name was Colgrevance of Gore, and he with a sword struck</a>
<a id='line_29713'>at Sir Launcelot mightily; and he put aside the stroke, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_29714'>such a buffet upon the helmet, that he fell grovelling dead within the</a>
<a id='line_29715'>chamber door. And then Sir Launcelot with great might drew that dead</a>
<a id='line_29716'>knight within the chamber door; and Sir Launcelot with help of the</a>
<a id='line_29717'>queen and her ladies was lightly armed in Sir Colgrevance’s armour.</a>
<a id='line_29718'></a>
<a id='line_29719'>And ever stood Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred crying: Traitor-knight,</a>
<a id='line_29720'>come out of the queen’s chamber. Leave your noise, said Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29721'>unto Sir Agravaine, for wit you well, Sir Agravaine, ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_29722'>prison me this night; and therefore an ye do by my counsel, go ye all</a>
<a id='line_29723'>from this chamber door, and make not such crying and such manner of</a>
<a id='line_29724'>slander as ye do; for I promise you by my knighthood, an ye will depart</a>
<a id='line_29725'>and make no more noise, I shall as to-morn appear afore you all before</a>
<a id='line_29726'>the king, and then let it be seen which of you all, outher else ye all,</a>
<a id='line_29727'>that will accuse me of treason; and there I shall answer you as a</a>
<a id='line_29728'>knight should, that hither I came to the queen for no manner of mal</a>
<a id='line_29729'>engin, and that will I prove and make it good upon you with my hands.</a>
<a id='line_29730'>Fie on thee, traitor, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, we will have</a>
<a id='line_29731'>thee maugre thy head, and slay thee if we list; for we let thee wit we</a>
<a id='line_29732'>have the choice of King Arthur to save thee or to slay thee. Ah sirs,</a>
<a id='line_29733'>said Sir Launcelot, is there none other grace with you? then keep</a>
<a id='line_29734'>yourself.</a>
<a id='line_29735'></a>
<a id='line_29736'>So then Sir Launcelot set all open the chamber door, and mightily and</a>
<a id='line_29737'>knightly he strode in amongst them; and anon at the first buffet he</a>
<a id='line_29738'>slew Sir Agravaine. And twelve of his fellows after, within a little</a>
<a id='line_29739'>while after, he laid them cold to the earth, for there was none of the</a>
<a id='line_29740'>twelve that might stand Sir Launcelot one buffet. Also Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29741'>wounded Sir Mordred, and he fled with all his might. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_29742'>Launcelot returned again unto the queen, and said: Madam, now wit you</a>
<a id='line_29743'>well all our true love is brought to an end, for now will King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_29744'>ever be my foe; and therefore, madam, an it like you that I may have</a>
<a id='line_29745'>you with me, I shall save you from all manner adventures dangerous.</a>
<a id='line_29746'>That is not best, said the queen; meseemeth now ye have done so much</a>
<a id='line_29747'>harm, it will be best ye hold you still with this. And if ye see that</a>
<a id='line_29748'>as to-morn they will put me unto the death, then may ye rescue me as ye</a>
<a id='line_29749'>think best. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, for have ye no doubt,</a>
<a id='line_29750'>while I am living I shall rescue you. And then he kissed her, and</a>
<a id='line_29751'>either gave other a ring; and so there he left the queen, and went</a>
<a id='line_29752'>until his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_29753'></a>
<a id='line_29754'></a>
<a id='line_29755'></a>
<a id='line_29756'></a>
<a id='line_29757'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to Sir Bors, and told him how he had</a>
<a id='line_29758'>sped, and in what adventure he had been, and how he had escaped.</a>
<a id='line_29759'></a>
<a id='line_29760'></a>
<a id='line_29761'>When Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot he was never so glad of his home-coming</a>
<a id='line_29762'>as he was then. Jesu mercy, said Sir Launcelot, why be ye all armed:</a>
<a id='line_29763'>what meaneth this? Sir, said Sir Bors, after ye were departed from us,</a>
<a id='line_29764'>we all that be of your blood and your well-willers were so dretched</a>
<a id='line_29765'>that some of us leapt out of our beds naked, and some in their dreams</a>
<a id='line_29766'>caught naked swords in their hands; therefore, said Sir Bors, we deem</a>
<a id='line_29767'>there is some great strife at hand; and then we all deemed that ye were</a>
<a id='line_29768'>betrapped with some treason, and therefore we made us thus ready, what</a>
<a id='line_29769'>need that ever ye were in.</a>
<a id='line_29770'></a>
<a id='line_29771'>My fair nephew, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Bors, now shall ye wit all,</a>
<a id='line_29772'>that this night I was more harder bestead than ever I was in my life,</a>
<a id='line_29773'>and yet I escaped. And so he told them all how and in what manner, as</a>
<a id='line_29774'>ye have heard to-fore. And therefore, my fellows, said Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_29775'>pray you all that ye will be of good heart in what need somever I</a>
<a id='line_29776'>stand, for now is war come to us all. Sir, said Bors, all is welcome</a>
<a id='line_29777'>that God sendeth us, and we have had much weal with you and much</a>
<a id='line_29778'>worship, and therefore we will take the woe with you as we have taken</a>
<a id='line_29779'>the weal. And therefore, they said all (there were many good knights),</a>
<a id='line_29780'>look ye take no discomfort, for there nis no bands of knights under</a>
<a id='line_29781'>heaven but we shall be able to grieve them as much as they may us. And</a>
<a id='line_29782'>therefore discomfort not yourself by no manner, and we shall gather</a>
<a id='line_29783'>together that we love, and that loveth us, and what that ye will have</a>
<a id='line_29784'>done shall be done. And therefore, Sir Launcelot, said they, we will</a>
<a id='line_29785'>take the woe with the weal. Grant mercy, said Sir Launcelot, of your</a>
<a id='line_29786'>good comfort, for in my great distress, my fair nephew, ye comfort me</a>
<a id='line_29787'>greatly, and much I am beholding unto you. But this, my fair nephew, I</a>
<a id='line_29788'>would that ye did in all haste that ye may, or it be forth days, that</a>
<a id='line_29789'>ye will look in their lodging that be lodged here nigh about the king,</a>
<a id='line_29790'>which will hold with me, and which will not, for now I would know which</a>
<a id='line_29791'>were my friends from my foes. Sir, said Sir Bors, I shall do my pain,</a>
<a id='line_29792'>and or it be seven of the clock I shall wit of such as ye have said</a>
<a id='line_29793'>before, who will hold with you.</a>
<a id='line_29794'></a>
<a id='line_29795'>Then Sir Bors called unto him Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29796'>Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29797'>Galihodin, Sir Galihud, Sir Menadeuke Sir Villiers the Valiant, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29798'>Hebes le Renoumes, Sir Lavaine Sir Urre of Hungary, Sir Nerounes, Sir</a>
<a id='line_29799'>Plenorius. These two knights Sir Launcelot made, and the one he won</a>
<a id='line_29800'>upon a bridge, and therefore they would never be against him. And Harry</a>
<a id='line_29801'>le Fise du Lake, and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower, and Sir Melias</a>
<a id='line_29802'>de Lile, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse, that was Sir Alisander’s son Le</a>
<a id='line_29803'>Orphelin, because his mother Alice le Beale Pellerin and she was kin</a>
<a id='line_29804'>unto Sir Launcelot, and he held with him. So there came Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_29805'>and Sir Safere, his brother, to hold with Sir Launcelot, and Sir Clegis</a>
<a id='line_29806'>of Sadok, and Sir Dinas, Sir Clarius of Cleremont. So these</a>
<a id='line_29807'>two-and-twenty knights drew them together, and by then they were armed</a>
<a id='line_29808'>on horseback, and promised Sir Launcelot to do what he would. Then</a>
<a id='line_29809'>there fell to them, what of North Wales and of Cornwall, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_29810'>Lamorak’s sake and for Sir Tristram’s sake, to the number of a</a>
<a id='line_29811'>fourscore knights.</a>
<a id='line_29812'></a>
<a id='line_29813'>My lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well, I have been ever since I</a>
<a id='line_29814'>came into this country well willed unto my lord, King Arthur, and unto</a>
<a id='line_29815'>my lady, Queen Guenever, unto my power; and this night because my lady</a>
<a id='line_29816'>the queen sent for me to speak with her, I suppose it was made by</a>
<a id='line_29817'>treason, howbeit I dare largely excuse her person, notwithstanding I</a>
<a id='line_29818'>was there by a forecast near slain, but as Jesu provided me I escaped</a>
<a id='line_29819'>all their malice and treason. And then that noble knight Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29820'>told them all how he was hard bestead in the queen’s chamber, and how</a>
<a id='line_29821'>and in what manner he escaped from them. And therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29822'>Launcelot, wit you well, my fair lords, I am sure there nis but war</a>
<a id='line_29823'>unto me and mine. And for because I have slain this night these</a>
<a id='line_29824'>knights, I wot well, as is Sir Agravaine Sir Gawaine’s brother, and at</a>
<a id='line_29825'>the least twelve of his fellows, for this cause now I am sure of mortal</a>
<a id='line_29826'>war, for these knights were sent and ordained by King Arthur to betray</a>
<a id='line_29827'>me. And therefore the king will in his heat and malice judge the queen</a>
<a id='line_29828'>to the fire, and that may I not suffer, that she should be brent for my</a>
<a id='line_29829'>sake; for an I may be heard and suffered and so taken, I will fight for</a>
<a id='line_29830'>the queen, that she is a true lady unto her lord; but the king in his</a>
<a id='line_29831'>heat I dread me will not take me as I ought to be taken.</a>
<a id='line_29832'></a>
<a id='line_29833'></a>
<a id='line_29834'></a>
<a id='line_29835'></a>
<a id='line_29836'>CHAPTER VI. Of the counsel and advice that was taken by Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_29837'>and his friends for to save the queen.</a>
<a id='line_29838'></a>
<a id='line_29839'></a>
<a id='line_29840'>My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Sir Bors, by mine advice ye shall take the</a>
<a id='line_29841'>woe with the weal, and take it in patience, and thank God of it. And</a>
<a id='line_29842'>sithen it is fallen as it is, I counsel you keep yourself, for an ye</a>
<a id='line_29843'>will yourself, there is no fellowship of knights christened that shall</a>
<a id='line_29844'>do you wrong. Also I will counsel you my lord, Sir Launcelot, than an</a>
<a id='line_29845'>my lady, Queen Guenever, be in distress, insomuch as she is in pain for</a>
<a id='line_29846'>your sake, that ye knightly rescue her; an ye did otherwise, all the</a>
<a id='line_29847'>world will speak of you shame to the world’s end. Insomuch as ye were</a>
<a id='line_29848'>taken with her, whether ye did right or wrong, it is now your part to</a>
<a id='line_29849'>hold with the queen, that she be not slain and put to a mischievous</a>
<a id='line_29850'>death, for an she so die the shame shall be yours. Jesu defend me from</a>
<a id='line_29851'>shame, said Sir Launcelot, and keep and save my lady the queen from</a>
<a id='line_29852'>villainy and shameful death, and that she never be destroyed in my</a>
<a id='line_29853'>default; wherefore my fair lords, my kin, and my friends, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29854'>Launcelot, what will ye do? Then they said all: We will do as ye will</a>
<a id='line_29855'>do. I put this to you, said Sir Launcelot, that if my lord Arthur by</a>
<a id='line_29856'>evil counsel will to-morn in his heat put my lady the queen to the fire</a>
<a id='line_29857'>there to be brent, now I pray you counsel me what is best to do. Then</a>
<a id='line_29858'>they said all at once with one voice: Sir, us thinketh best that ye</a>
<a id='line_29859'>knightly rescue the queen, insomuch as she shall be brent it is for</a>
<a id='line_29860'>your sake; and it is to suppose, an ye might be handled, ye should have</a>
<a id='line_29861'>the same death, or a more shamefuler death. And sir, we say all, that</a>
<a id='line_29862'>ye have many times rescued her from death for other men’s quarrels, us</a>
<a id='line_29863'>seemeth it is more your worship that ye rescue the queen from this</a>
<a id='line_29864'>peril, insomuch she hath it for your sake.</a>
<a id='line_29865'></a>
<a id='line_29866'>Then Sir Launcelot stood still, and said: My fair lords, wit you well I</a>
<a id='line_29867'>would be loath to do that thing that should dishonour you or my blood,</a>
<a id='line_29868'>and wit you well I would be loath that my lady, the queen, should die a</a>
<a id='line_29869'>shameful death; but an it be so that ye will counsel me to rescue her,</a>
<a id='line_29870'>I must do much harm or I rescue her; and peradventure I shall there</a>
<a id='line_29871'>destroy some of my best friends, that should much repent me; and</a>
<a id='line_29872'>peradventure there be some, an they could well bring it about, or</a>
<a id='line_29873'>disobey my lord King Arthur, they would soon come to me, the which I</a>
<a id='line_29874'>were loath to hurt. And if so be that I rescue her, where shall I keep</a>
<a id='line_29875'>her? That shall be the least care of us all, said Sir Bors. How did the</a>
<a id='line_29876'>noble knight Sir Tristram, by your good will? kept not he with him La</a>
<a id='line_29877'>Beale Isoud near three year in Joyous Gard? the which was done by your</a>
<a id='line_29878'>alther device, and that same place is your own; and in likewise may ye</a>
<a id='line_29879'>do an ye list, and take the queen lightly away, if it so be the king</a>
<a id='line_29880'>will judge her to be brent; and in Joyous Gard ye may keep her long</a>
<a id='line_29881'>enough until the heat of the king be past. And then shall ye bring</a>
<a id='line_29882'>again the queen to the king with great worship; and then peradventure</a>
<a id='line_29883'>ye shall have thank for her bringing home, and love and thank where</a>
<a id='line_29884'>other shall have maugre.</a>
<a id='line_29885'></a>
<a id='line_29886'>That is hard to do, said Sir Launcelot, for by Sir Tristram I may have</a>
<a id='line_29887'>a warning, for when by means of treaties, Sir Tristram brought again La</a>
<a id='line_29888'>Beale Isoud unto King Mark from Joyous Gard, look what befell on the</a>
<a id='line_29889'>end, how shamefully that false traitor King Mark slew him as he sat</a>
<a id='line_29890'>harping afore his lady La Beale Isoud, with a grounden glaive he thrust</a>
<a id='line_29891'>him in behind to the heart. It grieveth me, said Sir Launcelot, to</a>
<a id='line_29892'>speak of his death, for all the world may not find such a knight. All</a>
<a id='line_29893'>this is truth, said Sir Bors, but there is one thing shall courage you</a>
<a id='line_29894'>and us all, ye know well King Arthur and King Mark were never like of</a>
<a id='line_29895'>conditions, for there was never yet man could prove King Arthur untrue</a>
<a id='line_29896'>of his promise.</a>
<a id='line_29897'></a>
<a id='line_29898'>So to make short tale, they were all consented that for better outher</a>
<a id='line_29899'>for worse, if so were that the queen were on that morn brought to the</a>
<a id='line_29900'>fire, shortly they all would rescue her. And so by the advice of Sir</a>
<a id='line_29901'>Launcelot, they put them all in an embushment in a wood, as nigh</a>
<a id='line_29902'>Carlisle as they might, and there they abode still, to wit what the</a>
<a id='line_29903'>king would do.</a>
<a id='line_29904'></a>
<a id='line_29905'></a>
<a id='line_29906'></a>
<a id='line_29907'></a>
<a id='line_29908'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Mordred rode hastily to the king, to tell him of</a>
<a id='line_29909'>the affray and death of Sir Agravaine and the other knights.</a>
<a id='line_29910'></a>
<a id='line_29911'></a>
<a id='line_29912'>Now turn we again unto Sir Mordred, that when he was escaped from the</a>
<a id='line_29913'>noble knight, Sir Launcelot, he anon gat his horse and mounted upon</a>
<a id='line_29914'>him, and rode unto King Arthur, sore wounded and smitten, and all</a>
<a id='line_29915'>forbled; and there he told the king all how it was, and how they were</a>
<a id='line_29916'>all slain save himself all only. Jesu mercy, how may this be? said the</a>
<a id='line_29917'>king; took ye him in the queen’s chamber? Yea, so God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_29918'>Mordred, there we found him unarmed, and there he slew Colgrevance, and</a>
<a id='line_29919'>armed him in his armour; and all this he told the king from the</a>
<a id='line_29920'>beginning to the ending. Jesu mercy, said the king, he is a marvellous</a>
<a id='line_29921'>knight of prowess. Alas, me sore repenteth, said the king, that ever</a>
<a id='line_29922'>Sir Launcelot should be against me. Now I am sure the noble fellowship</a>
<a id='line_29923'>of the Round Table is broken for ever, for with him will many a noble</a>
<a id='line_29924'>knight hold; and now it is fallen so, said the king, that I may not</a>
<a id='line_29925'>with my worship, but the queen must suffer the death. So then there was</a>
<a id='line_29926'>made great ordinance in this heat, that the queen must be judged to the</a>
<a id='line_29927'>death. And the law was such in those days that whatsomever they were,</a>
<a id='line_29928'>of what estate or degree, if they were found guilty of treason, there</a>
<a id='line_29929'>should be none other remedy but death; and outher the men or the taking</a>
<a id='line_29930'>with the deed should be causer of their hasty judgment. And right so</a>
<a id='line_29931'>was it ordained for Queen Guenever, because Sir Mordred was escaped</a>
<a id='line_29932'>sore wounded, and the death of thirteen knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_29933'>These proofs and experiences caused King Arthur to command the queen to</a>
<a id='line_29934'>the fire there to be brent.</a>
<a id='line_29935'></a>
<a id='line_29936'>Then spake Sir Gawaine, and said: My lord Arthur, I would counsel you</a>
<a id='line_29937'>not to be over-hasty, but that ye would put it in respite, this</a>
<a id='line_29938'>judgment of my lady the queen, for many causes. One it is, though it</a>
<a id='line_29939'>were so that Sir Launcelot were found in the queen’s chamber, yet it</a>
<a id='line_29940'>might be so that he came thither for none evil; for ye know my lord,</a>
<a id='line_29941'>said Sir Gawaine, that the queen is much beholden unto Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_29942'>more than unto any other knight, for ofttimes he hath saved her life,</a>
<a id='line_29943'>and done battle for her when all the court refused the queen; and</a>
<a id='line_29944'>peradventure she sent for him for goodness and for none evil, to reward</a>
<a id='line_29945'>him for his good deeds that he had done to her in times past. And</a>
<a id='line_29946'>peradventure my lady, the queen, sent for him to that intent that Sir</a>
<a id='line_29947'>Launcelot should come to her good grace privily and secretly, weening</a>
<a id='line_29948'>to her that it was best so to do, in eschewing and dreading of slander;</a>
<a id='line_29949'>for ofttimes we do many things that we ween it be for the best, and yet</a>
<a id='line_29950'>peradventure it turneth to the worst. For I dare say, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_29951'>my lady, your queen, is to you both good and true; and as for Sir</a>
<a id='line_29952'>Launcelot, said Sir Gawaine, I dare say he will make it good upon any</a>
<a id='line_29953'>knight living that will put upon himself villainy or shame, and in like</a>
<a id='line_29954'>wise he will make good for my lady, Dame Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_29955'></a>
<a id='line_29956'>That I believe well, said King Arthur, but I will not that way with Sir</a>
<a id='line_29957'>Launcelot, for he trusteth so much upon his hands and his might that he</a>
<a id='line_29958'>doubteth no man; and therefore for my queen he shall never fight more,</a>
<a id='line_29959'>for she shall have the law. And if I may get Sir Launcelot, wit you</a>
<a id='line_29960'>well he shall have a shameful death. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_29961'>that I may never see it. Why say ye so? said King Arthur; forsooth ye</a>
<a id='line_29962'>have no cause to love Sir Launcelot, for this night last past he slew</a>
<a id='line_29963'>your brother, Sir Agravaine, a full good knight, and almost he had</a>
<a id='line_29964'>slain your other brother, Sir Mordred, and also there he slew thirteen</a>
<a id='line_29965'>noble knights; and also, Sir Gawaine, remember you he slew two sons of</a>
<a id='line_29966'>yours, Sir Florence and Sir Lovel. My lord, said Sir Gawaine, of all</a>
<a id='line_29967'>this I have knowledge, of whose deaths I repent me sore; but insomuch I</a>
<a id='line_29968'>gave them warning, and told my brethren and my sons aforehand what</a>
<a id='line_29969'>would fall in the end, insomuch they would not do by my counsel, I will</a>
<a id='line_29970'>not meddle me thereof, nor revenge me nothing of their deaths; for I</a>
<a id='line_29971'>told them it was no boot to strive with Sir Launcelot. Howbeit I am</a>
<a id='line_29972'>sorry of the death of my brethren and of my sons, for they are the</a>
<a id='line_29973'>causers of their own death; for ofttimes I warned my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_29974'>Agravaine, and I told him the perils the which be now fallen.</a>
<a id='line_29975'></a>
<a id='line_29976'></a>
<a id='line_29977'></a>
<a id='line_29978'></a>
<a id='line_29979'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and his kinsmen rescued the queen from</a>
<a id='line_29980'>the fire, and how he slew many knights.</a>
<a id='line_29981'></a>
<a id='line_29982'></a>
<a id='line_29983'>Then said the noble King Arthur to Sir Gawaine: Dear nephew, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_29984'>make you ready in your best armour, with your brethren, Sir Gaheris and</a>
<a id='line_29985'>Sir Gareth, to bring my queen to the fire, there to have her judgment</a>
<a id='line_29986'>and receive the death. Nay, my most noble lord, said Sir Gawaine, that</a>
<a id='line_29987'>will I never do; for wit you well I will never be in that place where</a>
<a id='line_29988'>so noble a queen as is my lady, Dame Guenever, shall take a shameful</a>
<a id='line_29989'>end. For wit you well, said Sir Gawaine, my heart will never serve me</a>
<a id='line_29990'>to see her die; and it shall never be said that ever I was of your</a>
<a id='line_29991'>counsel of her death.</a>
<a id='line_29992'></a>
<a id='line_29993'>Then said the king to Sir Gawaine: Suffer your brothers Sir Gaheris and</a>
<a id='line_29994'>Sir Gareth to be there. My lord, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well they</a>
<a id='line_29995'>will be loath to be there present, because of many adventures the which</a>
<a id='line_29996'>be like there to fall, but they are young and full unable to say you</a>
<a id='line_29997'>nay. Then spake Sir Gaheris, and the good knight Sir Gareth, unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_29998'>Arthur: Sir, ye may well command us to be there, but wit you well it</a>
<a id='line_29999'>shall be sore against our will; but an we be there by your strait</a>
<a id='line_30000'>commandment ye shall plainly hold us there excused: we will be there in</a>
<a id='line_30001'>peaceable wise, and bear none harness of war upon us. In the name of</a>
<a id='line_30002'>God, said the king, then make you ready, for she shall soon have her</a>
<a id='line_30003'>judgment anon. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, that ever I should endure to see</a>
<a id='line_30004'>this woful day. So Sir Gawaine turned him and wept heartily, and so he</a>
<a id='line_30005'>went into his chamber; and then the queen was led forth without</a>
<a id='line_30006'>Carlisle, and there she was despoiled into her smock. And so then her</a>
<a id='line_30007'>ghostly father was brought to her, to be shriven of her misdeeds. Then</a>
<a id='line_30008'>was there weeping, and wailing, and wringing of hands, of many lords</a>
<a id='line_30009'>and ladies, but there were but few in comparison that would bear any</a>
<a id='line_30010'>armour for to strength the death of the queen.</a>
<a id='line_30011'></a>
<a id='line_30012'>Then was there one that Sir Launcelot had sent unto that place for to</a>
<a id='line_30013'>espy what time the queen should go unto her death; and anon as he saw</a>
<a id='line_30014'>the queen despoiled into her smock, and so shriven, then he gave Sir</a>
<a id='line_30015'>Launcelot warning. Then was there but spurring and plucking up of</a>
<a id='line_30016'>horses, and right so they came to the fire. And who that stood against</a>
<a id='line_30017'>them, there were they slain; there might none withstand Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30018'>so all that bare arms and withstood them, there were they slain, full</a>
<a id='line_30019'>many a noble knight. For there was slain Sir Belliance le Orgulous, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30020'>Segwarides, Sir Griflet, Sir Brandiles, Sir Aglovale, Sir Tor; Sir</a>
<a id='line_30021'>Gauter, Sir Gillimer, Sir Reynolds’ three brethren; Sir Damas, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30022'>Priamus, Sir Kay the Stranger, Sir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Herminde;</a>
<a id='line_30023'>Sir Pertilope, Sir Perimones, two brethren that were called the Green</a>
<a id='line_30024'>Knight and the Red Knight. And so in this rushing and hurling, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_30025'>Launcelot thrang here and there, it mishapped him to slay Gaheris and</a>
<a id='line_30026'>Sir Gareth, the noble knight, for they were unarmed and unware. For as</a>
<a id='line_30027'>the French book saith, Sir Launcelot smote Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_30028'>upon the brain-pans, wherethrough they were slain in the field; howbeit</a>
<a id='line_30029'>in very truth Sir Launcelot saw them not, and so were they found dead</a>
<a id='line_30030'>among the thickest of the press.</a>
<a id='line_30031'></a>
<a id='line_30032'>Then when Sir Launcelot had thus done, and slain and put to flight all</a>
<a id='line_30033'>that would withstand him, then he rode straight unto Dame Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_30034'>made a kirtle and a gown to be cast upon her; and then he made her to</a>
<a id='line_30035'>be set behind him, and prayed her to be of good cheer. Wit you well the</a>
<a id='line_30036'>queen was glad that she was escaped from the death. And then she</a>
<a id='line_30037'>thanked God and Sir Launcelot; and so he rode his way with the queen,</a>
<a id='line_30038'>as the French book saith, unto Joyous Gard, and there he kept her as a</a>
<a id='line_30039'>noble knight should do; and many great lords and some kings sent Sir</a>
<a id='line_30040'>Launcelot many good knights, and many noble knights drew unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_30041'>Launcelot. When this was known openly, that King Arthur and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30042'>Launcelot were at debate, many knights were glad of their debate, and</a>
<a id='line_30043'>many were full heavy of their debate.</a>
<a id='line_30044'></a>

<a id='line_30047'></a>
<a id='line_30048'>CHAPTER IX. Of the sorrow and lamentation of King Arthur for the death</a>
<a id='line_30049'>of his nephews and other good knights, and also for the queen, his</a>
<a id='line_30050'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_30051'></a>
<a id='line_30052'></a>
<a id='line_30053'>So turn we again unto King Arthur, that when it was told him how and in</a>
<a id='line_30054'>what manner of wise the queen was taken away from the fire, and when he</a>
<a id='line_30055'>heard of the death of his noble knights, and in especial of Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_30056'>and Sir Gareth’s death, then the king swooned for pure sorrow. And when</a>
<a id='line_30057'>he awoke of his swoon, then he said: Alas, that ever I bare crown upon</a>
<a id='line_30058'>my head! for now have I lost the fairest fellowship of noble knights</a>
<a id='line_30059'>that ever held Christian king together. Alas, my good knights be slain</a>
<a id='line_30060'>away from me: now within these two days I have lost forty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_30061'>also the noble fellowship of Sir Launcelot and his blood, for now I may</a>
<a id='line_30062'>never hold them together no more with my worship. Alas that ever this</a>
<a id='line_30063'>war began. Now fair fellows, said the king, I charge you that no man</a>
<a id='line_30064'>tell Sir Gawaine of the death of his two brethren; for I am sure, said</a>
<a id='line_30065'>the king, when Sir Gawaine heareth tell that Sir Gareth is dead he will</a>
<a id='line_30066'>go nigh out of his mind. Mercy Jesu, said the king, why slew he Sir</a>
<a id='line_30067'>Gareth and Sir Gaheris, for I dare say as for Sir Gareth he loved Sir</a>
<a id='line_30068'>Launcelot above all men earthly. That is truth, said some knights, but</a>
<a id='line_30069'>they were slain in the hurtling as Sir Launcelot thrang in the thick of</a>
<a id='line_30070'>the press; and as they were unarmed he smote them and wist not whom</a>
<a id='line_30071'>that he smote, and so unhappily they were slain. The death of them,</a>
<a id='line_30072'>said Arthur, will cause the greatest mortal war that ever was; I am</a>
<a id='line_30073'>sure, wist Sir Gawaine that Sir Gareth were slain, I should never have</a>
<a id='line_30074'>rest of him till I had destroyed Sir Launcelot’s kin and himself both,</a>
<a id='line_30075'>outher else he to destroy me. And therefore, said the king, wit you</a>
<a id='line_30076'>well my heart was never so heavy as it is now, and much more I am</a>
<a id='line_30077'>sorrier for my good knights’ loss than for the loss of my fair queen;</a>
<a id='line_30078'>for queens I might have enow, but such a fellowship of good knights</a>
<a id='line_30079'>shall never be together in no company. And now I dare say, said King</a>
<a id='line_30080'>Arthur, there was never Christian king held such a fellowship together;</a>
<a id='line_30081'>and alas that ever Sir Launcelot and I should be at debate. Ah</a>
<a id='line_30082'>Agravaine, Agravaine, said the king, Jesu forgive it thy soul, for</a>
<a id='line_30083'>thine evil will, that thou and thy brother Sir Mordred hadst unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_30084'>Launcelot, hath caused all this sorrow: and ever among these complaints</a>
<a id='line_30085'>the king wept and swooned.</a>
<a id='line_30086'></a>
<a id='line_30087'>Then there came one unto Sir Gawaine, and told him how the queen was</a>
<a id='line_30088'>led away with Sir Launcelot, and nigh a twenty-four knights slain. O</a>
<a id='line_30089'>Jesu defend my brethren, said Sir Gawaine, for full well wist I that</a>
<a id='line_30090'>Sir Launcelot would rescue her, outher else he would die in that field;</a>
<a id='line_30091'>and to say the truth he had not been a man of worship had he not</a>
<a id='line_30092'>rescued the queen that day, insomuch she should have been brent for his</a>
<a id='line_30093'>sake. And as in that, said Sir Gawaine, he hath done but knightly, and</a>
<a id='line_30094'>as I would have done myself an I had stood in like case. But where are</a>
<a id='line_30095'>my brethren? said Sir Gawaine, I marvel I hear not of them. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_30096'>that man, Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris be slain. Jesu defend, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30097'>Gawaine, for all the world I would not that they were slain, and in</a>
<a id='line_30098'>especial my good brother, Sir Gareth. Sir, said the man, he is slain,</a>
<a id='line_30099'>and that is great pity. Who slew him? said Sir Gawaine. Sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_30100'>man, Launcelot slew them both. That may I not believe, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30101'>Gawaine, that ever he slew my brother, Sir Gareth; for I dare say my</a>
<a id='line_30102'>brother Gareth loved him better than me, and all his brethren, and the</a>
<a id='line_30103'>king both. Also I dare say, an Sir Launcelot had desired my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_30104'>Gareth, with him he would have been with him against the king and us</a>
<a id='line_30105'>all, and therefore I may never believe that Sir Launcelot slew my</a>
<a id='line_30106'>brother. Sir, said this man, it is noised that he slew him.</a>
<a id='line_30107'></a>

<a id='line_30111'>CHAPTER X. How King Arthur at the request of Sir Gawaine concluded to</a>
<a id='line_30112'>make war against Sir Launcelot, and laid siege to his castle called</a>
<a id='line_30113'>Joyous Gard.</a>
<a id='line_30114'></a>
<a id='line_30115'></a>
<a id='line_30116'>Alas, said Sir Gawaine, now is my joy gone. And then he fell down and</a>
<a id='line_30117'>swooned, and long he lay there as he had been dead. And then, when he</a>
<a id='line_30118'>arose of his swoon, he cried out sorrowfully, and said: Alas! And right</a>
<a id='line_30119'>so Sir Gawaine ran to the king, crying and weeping: O King Arthur, mine</a>
<a id='line_30120'>uncle, my good brother Sir Gareth is slain, and so is my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_30121'>Gaheris, the which were two noble knights. Then the king wept, and he</a>
<a id='line_30122'>both; and so they fell a-swooning. And when they were revived then</a>
<a id='line_30123'>spake Sir Gawaine: Sir, I will go see my brother, Sir Gareth. Ye may</a>
<a id='line_30124'>not see him, said the king, for I caused him to be interred, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30125'>Gaheris both; for I well understood that ye would make over-much</a>
<a id='line_30126'>sorrow, and the sight of Sir Gareth should have caused your double</a>
<a id='line_30127'>sorrow. Alas, my lord, said Sir Gawaine, how slew he my brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30128'>Gareth? Mine own good lord I pray you tell me. Truly, said the king, I</a>
<a id='line_30129'>shall tell you how it is told me, Sir Launcelot slew him and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30130'>Gaheris both. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, they bare none arms against him,</a>
<a id='line_30131'>neither of them both. I wot not how it was, said the king, but as it is</a>
<a id='line_30132'>said, Sir Launcelot slew them both in the thickest of the press and</a>
<a id='line_30133'>knew them not; and therefore let us shape a remedy for to revenge their</a>
<a id='line_30134'>deaths.</a>
<a id='line_30135'></a>
<a id='line_30136'>My king, my lord, and mine uncle, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well now I</a>
<a id='line_30137'>shall make you a promise that I shall hold by my knighthood, that from</a>
<a id='line_30138'>this day I shall never fail Sir Launcelot until the one of us have</a>
<a id='line_30139'>slain the other. And therefore I require you, my lord and king, dress</a>
<a id='line_30140'>you to the war, for wit you well I will be revenged upon Sir Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_30141'>and therefore, as ye will have my service and my love, now haste you</a>
<a id='line_30142'>thereto, and assay your friends. For I promise unto God, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30143'>Gawaine, for the death of my brother, Sir Gareth, I shall seek Sir</a>
<a id='line_30144'>Launcelot throughout seven kings’ realms, but I shall slay him or else</a>
<a id='line_30145'>he shall slay me. Ye shall not need to seek him so far, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_30146'>for as I hear say, Sir Launcelot will abide me and you in the Joyous</a>
<a id='line_30147'>Gard; and much people draweth unto him, as I hear say. That may I</a>
<a id='line_30148'>believe, said Sir Gawaine; but my lord, he said, assay your friends,</a>
<a id='line_30149'>and I will assay mine. It shall be done, said the king, and as I</a>
<a id='line_30150'>suppose I shall be big enough to draw him out of the biggest tower of</a>
<a id='line_30151'>his castle.</a>
<a id='line_30152'></a>
<a id='line_30153'>So then the king sent letters and writs throughout all England, both in</a>
<a id='line_30154'>the length and the breadth, for to assummon all his knights. And so</a>
<a id='line_30155'>unto Arthur drew many knights, dukes, and earls, so that he had a great</a>
<a id='line_30156'>host. And when they were assembled, the king informed them how Sir</a>
<a id='line_30157'>Launcelot had bereft him his queen. Then the king and all his host made</a>
<a id='line_30158'>them ready to lay siege about Sir Launcelot, where he lay within Joyous</a>
<a id='line_30159'>Gard. Thereof heard Sir Launcelot, and purveyed him of many good</a>
<a id='line_30160'>knights, for with him held many knights; and some for his own sake, and</a>
<a id='line_30161'>some for the queen’s sake. Thus they were on both parties well</a>
<a id='line_30162'>furnished and garnished of all manner of thing that longed to the war.</a>
<a id='line_30163'>But King Arthur’s host was so big that Sir Launcelot would not abide</a>
<a id='line_30164'>him in the field, for he was full loath to do battle against the king;</a>
<a id='line_30165'>but Sir Launcelot drew him to his strong castle with all manner of</a>
<a id='line_30166'>victual, and as many noble men as he might suffice within the town and</a>
<a id='line_30167'>the castle. Then came King Arthur with Sir Gawaine with an huge host,</a>
<a id='line_30168'>and laid a siege all about Joyous Gard, both at the town and at the</a>
<a id='line_30169'>castle, and there they made strong war on both parties. But in no wise</a>
<a id='line_30170'>Sir Launcelot would ride out, nor go out of his castle, of long time;</a>
<a id='line_30171'>neither he would none of his good knights to issue out, neither none of</a>
<a id='line_30172'>the town nor of the castle, until fifteen weeks were past.</a>

<a id='line_30179'></a>
<a id='line_30180'></a>
<a id='line_30181'>Then it befell upon a day in harvest time, Sir Launcelot looked over</a>
<a id='line_30182'>the walls, and spake on high unto King Arthur and Sir Gawaine: My lords</a>
<a id='line_30183'>both, wit ye well all is in vain that ye make at this siege, for here</a>
<a id='line_30184'>win ye no worship but maugre and dishonour; for an it list me to come</a>
<a id='line_30185'>myself out and my good knights, I should full soon make an end of this</a>
<a id='line_30186'>war. Come forth, said Arthur unto Launcelot, an thou durst, and I</a>
<a id='line_30187'>promise thee I shall meet thee in midst of the field. God defend me,</a>
<a id='line_30188'>said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should encounter with the most noble</a>
<a id='line_30189'>king that made me knight. Fie upon thy fair language, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_30190'>for wit you well and trust it, I am thy mortal foe, and ever will to my</a>
<a id='line_30191'>death day; for thou hast slain my good knights, and full noble men of</a>
<a id='line_30192'>my blood, that I shall never recover again. Also thou hast lain by my</a>
<a id='line_30193'>queen, and holden her many winters, and sithen like a traitor taken her</a>
<a id='line_30194'>from me by force.</a>
<a id='line_30195'></a>
<a id='line_30196'>My most noble lord and king, said Sir Launcelot, ye may say what ye</a>
<a id='line_30197'>will, for ye wot well with yourself will I not strive; but thereas ye</a>
<a id='line_30198'>say I have slain your good knights, I wot well that I have done so, and</a>
<a id='line_30199'>that me sore repenteth; but I was enforced to do battle with them in</a>
<a id='line_30200'>saving of my life, or else I must have suffered them to have slain me.</a>
<a id='line_30201'>And as for my lady, Queen Guenever, except your person of your</a>
<a id='line_30202'>highness, and my lord Sir Gawaine, there is no knight under heaven that</a>
<a id='line_30203'>dare make it good upon me, that ever I was a traitor unto your person.</a>
<a id='line_30204'>And where it please you to say that I have holden my lady your queen</a>
<a id='line_30205'>years and winters, unto that I shall ever make a large answer, and</a>
<a id='line_30206'>prove it upon any knight that beareth the life, except your person and</a>
<a id='line_30207'>Sir Gawaine, that my lady, Queen Guenever, is a true lady unto your</a>
<a id='line_30208'>person as any is living unto her lord, and that will I make good with</a>
<a id='line_30209'>my hands. Howbeit it hath liked her good grace to have me in chierte,</a>
<a id='line_30210'>and to cherish me more than any other knight; and unto my power I again</a>
<a id='line_30211'>have deserved her love, for ofttimes, my lord, ye have consented that</a>
<a id='line_30212'>she should be brent and destroyed, in your heat, and then it fortuned</a>
<a id='line_30213'>me to do battle for her, and or I departed from her adversary they</a>
<a id='line_30214'>confessed their untruth, and she full worshipfully excused. And at such</a>
<a id='line_30215'>times, my lord Arthur, said Sir Launcelot, ye loved me, and thanked me</a>
<a id='line_30216'>when I saved your queen from the fire; and then ye promised me for ever</a>
<a id='line_30217'>to be my good lord; and now methinketh ye reward me full ill for my</a>
<a id='line_30218'>good service. And my good lord, meseemeth I had lost a great part of my</a>
<a id='line_30219'>worship in my knighthood an I had suffered my lady, your queen, to have</a>
<a id='line_30220'>been brent, and insomuch she should have been brent for my sake. For</a>
<a id='line_30221'>sithen I have done battles for your queen in other quarrels than in</a>
<a id='line_30222'>mine own, meseemeth now I had more right to do battle for her in right</a>
<a id='line_30223'>quarrel. And therefore my good and gracious lord, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30224'>take your queen unto your good grace, for she is both fair, true, and</a>
<a id='line_30225'>good.</a>
<a id='line_30226'></a>
<a id='line_30227'>Fie on thee, false recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine; I let thee wit my</a>
<a id='line_30228'>lord, mine uncle, King Arthur, shall have his queen and thee, maugre</a>
<a id='line_30229'>thy visage, and slay you both whether it please him. It may well be,</a>
<a id='line_30230'>said Sir Launcelot, but wit you well, my lord Sir Gawaine, an me list</a>
<a id='line_30231'>to come out of this castle ye should win me and the queen more harder</a>
<a id='line_30232'>than ever ye won a strong battle. Fie on thy proud words, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30233'>Gawaine; as for my lady, the queen, I will never say of her shame. But</a>
<a id='line_30234'>thou, false and recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine, what cause hadst</a>
<a id='line_30235'>thou to slay my good brother Sir Gareth, that loved thee more than all</a>
<a id='line_30236'>my kin? Alas thou madest him knight thine own hands; why slew thou him</a>
<a id='line_30237'>that loved thee so well? For to excuse me, said Sir Launcelot, it</a>
<a id='line_30238'>helpeth me not, but by Jesu, and by the faith that I owe to the high</a>
<a id='line_30239'>order of knighthood, I should with as good will have slain my nephew,</a>
<a id='line_30240'>Sir Bors de Ganis, at that time. But alas that ever I was so unhappy,</a>
<a id='line_30241'>said Launcelot, that I had not seen Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris.</a>
<a id='line_30242'></a>
<a id='line_30243'>Thou liest, recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine, thou slewest him in</a>
<a id='line_30244'>despite of me; and therefore, wit thou well I shall make war to thee,</a>
<a id='line_30245'>and all the while that I may live. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30246'>Launcelot; for well I understand it helpeth not to seek none accordment</a>
<a id='line_30247'>while ye, Sir Gawaine, are so mischievously set. And if ye were not, I</a>
<a id='line_30248'>would not doubt to have the good grace of my lord Arthur. I believe it</a>
<a id='line_30249'>well, false recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine; for thou hast many long</a>
<a id='line_30250'>days overled me and us all, and destroyed many of our good knights. Ye</a>
<a id='line_30251'>say as it pleaseth you, said Sir Launcelot; and yet may it never be</a>
<a id='line_30252'>said on me, and openly proved, that ever I by forecast of treason slew</a>
<a id='line_30253'>no good knight, as my lord, Sir Gawaine, ye have done; and so did I</a>
<a id='line_30254'>never, but in my defence that I was driven thereto, in saving of my</a>
<a id='line_30255'>life. Ah, false knight, said Sir Gawaine, that thou meanest by Sir</a>
<a id='line_30256'>Lamorak: wit thou well I slew him. Ye slew him not yourself, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30257'>Launcelot; it had been overmuch on hand for you to have slain him, for</a>
<a id='line_30258'>he was one of the best knights christened of his age, and it was great</a>
<a id='line_30259'>pity of his death.</a>
<a id='line_30260'></a>

<a id='line_30264'>CHAPTER XII. How the cousins and kinsmen of Sir Launcelot excited him</a>
<a id='line_30265'>to go out to battle, and how they made them ready.</a>
<a id='line_30266'></a>
<a id='line_30267'></a>
<a id='line_30268'>Well, well, said Sir Gawaine to Launcelot, sithen thou enbraidest me of</a>
<a id='line_30269'>Sir Lamorak, wit thou well I shall never leave thee till I have thee at</a>
<a id='line_30270'>such avail that thou shalt not escape my hands. I trust you well</a>
<a id='line_30271'>enough, said Sir Launcelot, an ye may get me I get but little mercy.</a>
<a id='line_30272'>But as the French book saith, the noble King Arthur would have taken</a>
<a id='line_30273'>his queen again, and have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_30274'>Gawaine would not suffer him by no manner of mean. And then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_30275'>made many men to blow upon Sir Launcelot; and all at once they called</a>
<a id='line_30276'>him false recreant knight.</a>
<a id='line_30277'></a>
<a id='line_30278'>Then when Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel, heard</a>
<a id='line_30279'>this outcry, they called to them Sir Palomides, Sir Safere’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_30280'>and Sir Lavaine, with many more of their blood, and all they went unto</a>
<a id='line_30281'>Sir Launcelot, and said thus: My lord Sir Launcelot, wit ye well we</a>
<a id='line_30282'>have great scorn of the great rebukes that we heard Gawaine say to you;</a>
<a id='line_30283'>wherefore we pray you, and charge you as ye will have our service, keep</a>
<a id='line_30284'>us no longer within these walls; for wit you well plainly, we will ride</a>
<a id='line_30285'>into the field and do battle with them; for ye fare as a man that were</a>
<a id='line_30286'>afeard, and for all your fair speech it will not avail you. For wit you</a>
<a id='line_30287'>well Sir Gawaine will not suffer you to be accorded with King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_30288'>and therefore fight for your life and your right, an ye dare. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_30289'>said Sir Launcelot, for to ride out of this castle, and to do battle, I</a>
<a id='line_30290'>am full loath.</a>
<a id='line_30291'></a>
<a id='line_30292'>Then Sir Launcelot spake on high unto Sir Arthur and Sir Gawaine: My</a>
<a id='line_30293'>lords, I require you and beseech you, sithen that I am thus required</a>
<a id='line_30294'>and conjured to ride into the field, that neither you, my lord King</a>
<a id='line_30295'>Arthur, nor you Sir Gawaine, come not into the field. What shall we do</a>
<a id='line_30296'>then? said Sir Gawaine, [N]is this the king’s quarrel with thee to</a>
<a id='line_30297'>fight? and it is my quarrel to fight with thee, Sir Launcelot, because</a>
<a id='line_30298'>of the death of my brother Sir Gareth. Then must I needs unto battle,</a>
<a id='line_30299'>said Sir Launcelot. Now wit you well, my lord Arthur and Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_30300'>ye will repent it whensomever I do battle with you.</a>
<a id='line_30301'></a>
<a id='line_30302'>And so then they departed either from other; and then either party made</a>
<a id='line_30303'>them ready on the morn for to do battle, and great purveyance was made</a>
<a id='line_30304'>on both sides; and Sir Gawaine let purvey many knights for to wait upon</a>
<a id='line_30305'>Sir Launcelot, for to overset him and to slay him. And on the morn at</a>
<a id='line_30306'>underne Sir Arthur was ready in the field with three great hosts. And</a>
<a id='line_30307'>then Sir Launcelot’s fellowship came out at three gates, in a full good</a>
<a id='line_30308'>array; and Sir Lionel came in the foremost battle, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_30309'>came in the middle, and Sir Bors came out at the third gate. Thus they</a>
<a id='line_30310'>came in order and rule, as full noble knights; and always Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_30311'>charged all his knights in any wise to save King Arthur and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30312'>Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_30313'></a>
<a id='line_30314'></a>
<a id='line_30315'></a>
<a id='line_30316'></a>
<a id='line_30317'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Gawaine jousted and smote down Sir Lionel, and</a>
<a id='line_30318'>how Sir Launcelot horsed King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_30319'></a>
<a id='line_30320'></a>
<a id='line_30321'>Then came forth Sir Gawaine from the king’s host, and he came before</a>
<a id='line_30322'>and proffered to joust. And Sir Lionel was a fierce knight, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_30323'>he encountered with Sir Gawaine; and there Sir Gawaine smote Sir Lionel</a>
<a id='line_30324'>through out the body, that he dashed to the earth like as he had been</a>
<a id='line_30325'>dead; and then Sir Ector de Maris and other more bare him into the</a>
<a id='line_30326'>castle. Then there began a great stour, and much people was slain; and</a>
<a id='line_30327'>ever Sir Launcelot did what he might to save the people on King</a>
<a id='line_30328'>Arthur’s party, for Sir Palomides, and Sir Bors, and Sir Safere,</a>
<a id='line_30329'>overthrew many knights, for they were deadly knights. And Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_30330'>de Ganis, and Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, with Sir Bellangere le Beuse,</a>
<a id='line_30331'>these six knights did much harm; and ever King Arthur was nigh about</a>
<a id='line_30332'>Sir Launcelot to have slain him, and Sir Launcelot suffered him, and</a>
<a id='line_30333'>would not strike again. So Sir Bors encountered with King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_30334'>there with a spear Sir Bors smote him down; and so he alighted and drew</a>
<a id='line_30335'>his sword, and said to Sir Launcelot: Shall I make an end of this war?</a>
<a id='line_30336'>and that he meant to have slain King Arthur. Not so hardy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30337'>Launcelot, upon pain of thy head, that thou touch him no more, for I</a>
<a id='line_30338'>will never see that most noble king that made me knight neither slain</a>
<a id='line_30339'>ne shamed. And therewithal Sir Launcelot alighted off his horse and</a>
<a id='line_30340'>took up the king and horsed him again, and said thus: My lord Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_30341'>for God’s love stint this strife, for ye get here no worship, and I</a>
<a id='line_30342'>would do mine utterance, but always I forbear you, and ye nor none of</a>
<a id='line_30343'>yours forbeareth me; my lord, remember what I have done in many places,</a>
<a id='line_30344'>and now I am evil rewarded.</a>
<a id='line_30345'></a>
<a id='line_30346'>Then when King Arthur was on horseback, he looked upon Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30347'>and then the tears brast out of his eyen, thinking on the great</a>
<a id='line_30348'>courtesy that was in Sir Launcelot more than in any other man; and</a>
<a id='line_30349'>therewith the king rode his way, and might no longer behold him, and</a>
<a id='line_30350'>said: Alas, that ever this war began. And then either parties of the</a>
<a id='line_30351'>battles withdrew them to repose them, and buried the dead, and to the</a>
<a id='line_30352'>wounded men they laid soft salves; and thus they endured that night</a>
<a id='line_30353'>till on the morn. And on the morn by underne they made them ready to do</a>
<a id='line_30354'>battle. And then Sir Bors led the forward.</a>
<a id='line_30355'></a>
<a id='line_30356'>So upon the morn there came Sir Gawaine as brim as any boar, with a</a>
<a id='line_30357'>great spear in his hand. And when Sir Bors saw him he thought to</a>
<a id='line_30358'>revenge his brother Sir Lionel of the despite that Sir Gawaine did him</a>
<a id='line_30359'>the other day. And so they that knew either other feutred their spears,</a>
<a id='line_30360'>and with all their mights of their horses and themselves, they met</a>
<a id='line_30361'>together so felonously that either bare other through, and so they fell</a>
<a id='line_30362'>both to the earth; and then the battles joined, and there was much</a>
<a id='line_30363'>slaughter on both parties. Then Sir Launcelot rescued Sir Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_30364'>sent him into the castle; but neither Sir Gawaine nor Sir Bors died not</a>
<a id='line_30365'>of their wounds, for they were all holpen. Then Sir Lavaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30366'>Urre prayed Sir Launcelot to do his pain, and fight as they had done;</a>
<a id='line_30367'>For we see ye forbear and spare, and that doth much harm; therefore we</a>
<a id='line_30368'>pray you spare not your enemies no more than they do you. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_30369'>Sir Launcelot, I have no heart to fight against my lord Arthur, for</a>
<a id='line_30370'>ever meseemeth I do not as I ought to do. My lord, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_30371'>though ye spare them all this day they will never con you thank; and if</a>
<a id='line_30372'>they may get you at avail ye are but dead. So then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_30373'>understood that they said him truth; and then he strained himself more</a>
<a id='line_30374'>than he did aforehand, and because his nephew Sir Bors was sore</a>
<a id='line_30375'>wounded. And then within a little while, by evensong time, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30376'>Launcelot and his party better stood, for their horses went in blood</a>
<a id='line_30377'>past the fetlocks, there was so much people slain. And then for pity</a>
<a id='line_30378'>Sir Launcelot withheld his knights, and suffered King Arthur’s party</a>
<a id='line_30379'>for to withdraw them aside. And then Sir Launcelot’s party withdrew</a>
<a id='line_30380'>them into his castle, and either parties buried the dead, and put salve</a>
<a id='line_30381'>unto the wounded men.</a>
<a id='line_30382'></a>
<a id='line_30383'>So when Sir Gawaine was hurt, they on King Arthur’s party were not so</a>
<a id='line_30384'>orgulous as they were toforehand to do battle. Of this war was noised</a>
<a id='line_30385'>through all Christendom, and at the last it was noised afore the Pope;</a>
<a id='line_30386'>and he considering the great goodness of King Arthur, and of Sir</a>
<a id='line_30387'>Launcelot, that was called the most noblest knights of the world,</a>
<a id='line_30388'>wherefore the Pope called unto him a noble clerk that at that time was</a>
<a id='line_30389'>there present; the French book saith, it was the Bishop of Rochester;</a>
<a id='line_30390'>and the Pope gave him bulls under lead unto King Arthur of England,</a>
<a id='line_30391'>charging him upon pain of interdicting of all England, that he take his</a>
<a id='line_30392'>queen Dame Guenever unto him again, and accord with Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_30393'></a>
<a id='line_30394'></a>
<a id='line_30395'></a>
<a id='line_30396'></a>
<a id='line_30397'>CHAPTER XIV. How the Pope sent down his bulls to make peace, and how</a>
<a id='line_30398'>Sir Launcelot brought the queen to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_30399'></a>
<a id='line_30400'></a>
<a id='line_30401'>So when this Bishop was come to Carlisle he shewed the king these</a>
<a id='line_30402'>bulls. And when the king understood these bulls he nist what to do:</a>
<a id='line_30403'>full fain he would have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_30404'>Gawaine would not suffer him; but as for to have the queen, thereto he</a>
<a id='line_30405'>agreed. But in nowise Sir Gawaine would not suffer the king to accord</a>
<a id='line_30406'>with Sir Launcelot; but as for the queen he consented. And then the</a>
<a id='line_30407'>Bishop had of the king his great seal, and his assurance as he was a</a>
<a id='line_30408'>true anointed king that Sir Launcelot should come safe, and go safe,</a>
<a id='line_30409'>and that the queen should not be spoken unto of the king, nor of none</a>
<a id='line_30410'>other, for no thing done afore time past; and of all these appointments</a>
<a id='line_30411'>the Bishop brought with him sure assurance and writing, to shew Sir</a>
<a id='line_30412'>Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_30413'></a>
<a id='line_30414'>So when the Bishop was come to Joyous Gard, there he shewed Sir</a>
<a id='line_30415'>Launcelot how the Pope had written to Arthur and unto him, and there he</a>
<a id='line_30416'>told him the perils if he withheld the queen from the king. It was</a>
<a id='line_30417'>never in my thought, said Launcelot, to withhold the queen from my lord</a>
<a id='line_30418'>Arthur; but, insomuch she should have been dead for my sake, meseemeth</a>
<a id='line_30419'>it was my part to save her life, and put her from that danger, till</a>
<a id='line_30420'>better recover might come. And now I thank God, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30421'>that the Pope hath made her peace; for God knoweth, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30422'>I will be a thousandfold more gladder to bring her again, than ever I</a>
<a id='line_30423'>was of her taking away; with this, I may be sure to come safe and go</a>
<a id='line_30424'>safe, and that the queen shall have her liberty as she had before; and</a>
<a id='line_30425'>never for no thing that hath been surmised afore this time, she never</a>
<a id='line_30426'>from this day stand in no peril. For else, said Sir Launcelot, I dare</a>
<a id='line_30427'>adventure me to keep her from an harder shour than ever I kept her. It</a>
<a id='line_30428'>shall not need you, said the Bishop, to dread so much; for wit you</a>
<a id='line_30429'>well, the Pope must be obeyed, and it were not the Pope’s worship nor</a>
<a id='line_30430'>my poor honesty to wit you distressed, neither the queen, neither in</a>
<a id='line_30431'>peril, nor shamed. And then he shewed Sir Launcelot all his writing,</a>
<a id='line_30432'>both from the Pope and from King Arthur. This is sure enough, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30433'>Launcelot, for full well I dare trust my lord’s own writing and his</a>
<a id='line_30434'>seal, for he was never shamed of his promise. Therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30435'>Launcelot unto the Bishop, ye shall ride unto the king afore, and</a>
<a id='line_30436'>recommend me unto his good grace, and let him have knowledging that</a>
<a id='line_30437'>this same day eight days, by the grace of God, I myself shall bring my</a>
<a id='line_30438'>lady, Queen Guenever, unto him. And then say ye unto my most redoubted</a>
<a id='line_30439'>king, that I will say largely for the queen, that I shall none except</a>
<a id='line_30440'>for dread nor fear, but the king himself, and my lord Sir Gawaine; and</a>
<a id='line_30441'>that is more for the king’s love than for himself.</a>
<a id='line_30442'></a>
<a id='line_30443'>So the Bishop departed and came to the king at Carlisle, and told him</a>
<a id='line_30444'>all how Sir Launcelot answered him; and then the tears brast out of the</a>
<a id='line_30445'>king’s eyen. Then Sir Launcelot purveyed him an hundred knights, and</a>
<a id='line_30446'>all were clothed in green velvet, and their horses trapped to their</a>
<a id='line_30447'>heels; and every knight held a branch of olive in his hand, in tokening</a>
<a id='line_30448'>of peace. And the queen had four-and-twenty gentlewomen following her</a>
<a id='line_30449'>in the same wise; and Sir Launcelot had twelve coursers following him,</a>
<a id='line_30450'>and on every courser sat a young gentleman, and all they were arrayed</a>
<a id='line_30451'>in green velvet, with sarps of gold about their quarters, and the horse</a>
<a id='line_30452'>trapped in the same wise down to the heels, with many ouches, y-set</a>
<a id='line_30453'>with stones and pearls in gold, to the number of a thousand. And she</a>
<a id='line_30454'>and Sir Launcelot were clothed in white cloth of gold tissue; and right</a>
<a id='line_30455'>so as ye have heard, as the French book maketh mention, he rode with</a>
<a id='line_30456'>the queen from Joyous Gard to Carlisle. And so Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_30457'>throughout Carlisle, and so in the castle, that all men might behold;</a>
<a id='line_30458'>and wit you well there was many a weeping eye. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_30459'>himself alighted and avoided his horse, and took the queen, and so led</a>
<a id='line_30460'>her where King Arthur was in his seat: and Sir Gawaine sat afore him,</a>
<a id='line_30461'>and many other great lords. So when Sir Launcelot saw the king and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30462'>Gawaine, then he led the queen by the arm, and then he kneeled down,</a>
<a id='line_30463'>and the queen both. Wit you well then was there many bold knight there</a>
<a id='line_30464'>with King Arthur that wept as tenderly as though they had seen all</a>
<a id='line_30465'>their kin afore them. So the king sat still, and said no word. And when</a>
<a id='line_30466'>Sir Launcelot saw his countenance, he arose and pulled up the queen</a>
<a id='line_30467'>with him, and thus he spake full knightly.</a>

<a id='line_30474'></a>
<a id='line_30475'></a>
<a id='line_30476'>My most redoubted king, ye shall understand, by the Pope’s commandment</a>
<a id='line_30477'>and yours, I have brought to you my lady the queen, as right requireth;</a>
<a id='line_30478'>and if there be any knight, of whatsomever degree that he be, except</a>
<a id='line_30479'>your person, that will say or dare say but that she is true and clean</a>
<a id='line_30480'>to you, I here myself, Sir Launcelot du Lake, will make it good upon</a>
<a id='line_30481'>his body, that she is a true lady unto you; but liars ye have listened,</a>
<a id='line_30482'>and that hath caused debate betwixt you and me. For time hath been, my</a>
<a id='line_30483'>lord Arthur, that ye have been greatly pleased with me when I did</a>
<a id='line_30484'>battle for my lady, your queen; and full well ye know, my most noble</a>
<a id='line_30485'>king, that she hath been put to great wrong or this time; and sithen it</a>
<a id='line_30486'>pleased you at many times that I should fight for her, meseemeth, my</a>
<a id='line_30487'>good lord, I had more cause to rescue her from the fire, insomuch she</a>
<a id='line_30488'>should have been brent for my sake. For they that told you those tales</a>
<a id='line_30489'>were liars, and so it fell upon them; for by likelihood had not the</a>
<a id='line_30490'>might of God been with me, I might never have endured fourteen knights,</a>
<a id='line_30491'>and they armed and afore purposed, and I unarmed and not purposed. For</a>
<a id='line_30492'>I was sent for unto my lady your queen, I wot not for what cause; but I</a>
<a id='line_30493'>was not so soon within the chamber door, but anon Sir Agravaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30494'>Mordred called me traitor and recreant knight. They called thee right,</a>
<a id='line_30495'>said Sir Gawaine. My lord Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, in their</a>
<a id='line_30496'>quarrel they proved themselves not in the right. Well well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30497'>Launcelot, said the king, I have given thee no cause to do to me as</a>
<a id='line_30498'>thou hast done, for I have worshipped thee and thine more than any of</a>
<a id='line_30499'>all my knights.</a>
<a id='line_30500'></a>
<a id='line_30501'>My good lord, said Sir Launcelot, so ye be not displeased, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_30502'>understand I and mine have done you oft better service than any other</a>
<a id='line_30503'>knights have done, in many divers places; and where ye have been full</a>
<a id='line_30504'>hard bestead divers times, I have myself rescued you from many dangers;</a>
<a id='line_30505'>and ever unto my power I was glad to please you, and my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_30506'>Gawaine; both in jousts, and tournaments, and in battles set, both on</a>
<a id='line_30507'>horseback and on foot, I have often rescued you, and my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_30508'>Gawaine, and many mo of your knights in many divers places. For now I</a>
<a id='line_30509'>will make avaunt, said Sir Launcelot, I will that ye all wit that yet I</a>
<a id='line_30510'>found never no manner of knight but that I was overhard for him, an I</a>
<a id='line_30511'>had done my utterance, thanked be God; howbeit I have been matched with</a>
<a id='line_30512'>good knights, as Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak, but ever I had a favour</a>
<a id='line_30513'>unto them and a deeming what they were. And I take God to record, said</a>
<a id='line_30514'>Sir Launcelot, I never was wroth nor greatly heavy with no good knight</a>
<a id='line_30515'>an I saw him busy about to win worship; and glad I was ever when I</a>
<a id='line_30516'>found any knight that might endure me on horseback and on foot: howbeit</a>
<a id='line_30517'>Sir Carados of the Dolorous Tower was a full noble knight and a passing</a>
<a id='line_30518'>strong man, and that wot ye, my lord Sir Gawaine; for he might well be</a>
<a id='line_30519'>called a noble knight when he by fine force pulled you out of your</a>
<a id='line_30520'>saddle, and bound you overthwart afore him to his saddle bow; and</a>
<a id='line_30521'>there, my lord Sir Gawaine, I rescued you, and slew him afore your</a>
<a id='line_30522'>sight. Also I found his brother, Sir Turquin, in likewise leading Sir</a>
<a id='line_30523'>Gaheris, your brother, bounden afore him; and there I rescued your</a>
<a id='line_30524'>brother and slew that Turquin, and delivered three-score-and-four of my</a>
<a id='line_30525'>lord Arthur’s knights out of his prison. And now I dare say, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30526'>Launcelot, I met never with so strong knights, nor so well fighting, as</a>
<a id='line_30527'>was Sir Carados and Sir Turquin, for I fought with them to the</a>
<a id='line_30528'>uttermost. And therefore, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_30529'>meseemeth ye ought of right to remember this; for, an I might have your</a>
<a id='line_30530'>good will, I would trust to God to have my lord Arthur’s good grace.</a>

<a id='line_30535'>CHAPTER XVI. Of the communication between Sir Gawaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30536'>Launcelot, with much other language.</a>
<a id='line_30537'></a>
<a id='line_30538'></a>
<a id='line_30539'>The king may do as he will, said Sir Gawaine, but wit thou well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30540'>Launcelot, thou and I shall never be accorded while we live, for thou</a>
<a id='line_30541'>hast slain three of my brethren; and two of them ye slew traitorly and</a>
<a id='line_30542'>piteously, for they bare none harness against thee, nor none would</a>
<a id='line_30543'>bear. God would they had been armed, said Sir Launcelot, for then had</a>
<a id='line_30544'>they been alive. And wit ye well Sir Gawaine, as for Sir Gareth, I love</a>
<a id='line_30545'>none of my kinsmen so much as I did him; and ever while I live, said</a>
<a id='line_30546'>Sir Launcelot, I will bewail Sir Gareth’s death, not all only for the</a>
<a id='line_30547'>great fear I have of you, but many causes cause me to be sorrowful. One</a>
<a id='line_30548'>is, for I made him knight; another is, I wot well he loved me above all</a>
<a id='line_30549'>other knights; and the third is, he was passing noble, true, courteous,</a>
<a id='line_30550'>and gentle, and well conditioned; the fourth is, I wist well, anon as I</a>
<a id='line_30551'>heard that Sir Gareth was dead, I should never after have your love,</a>
<a id='line_30552'>but everlasting war betwixt us; and also I wist well that ye would</a>
<a id='line_30553'>cause my noble lord Arthur for ever to be my mortal foe. And as Jesu be</a>
<a id='line_30554'>my help, said Sir Launcelot, I slew never Sir Gareth nor Sir Gaheris by</a>
<a id='line_30555'>my will; but alas that ever they were unarmed that unhappy day. But</a>
<a id='line_30556'>thus much I shall offer me, said Sir Launcelot, if it may please the</a>
<a id='line_30557'>king’s good grace, and you, my lord Sir Gawaine, I shall first begin at</a>
<a id='line_30558'>Sandwich, and there I shall go in my shirt, barefoot; and at every ten</a>
<a id='line_30559'>miles’ end I will found and gar make an house of religion, of what</a>
<a id='line_30560'>order that ye will assign me, with an whole convent, to sing and read,</a>
<a id='line_30561'>day and night, in especial for Sir Gareth’s sake and Sir Gaheris. And</a>
<a id='line_30562'>this shall I perform from Sandwich unto Carlisle; and every house shall</a>
<a id='line_30563'>have sufficient livelihood. And this shall I perform while I have any</a>
<a id='line_30564'>livelihood in Christendom; and there nis none of all these religious</a>
<a id='line_30565'>places, but they shall be performed, furnished and garnished in all</a>
<a id='line_30566'>things as an holy place ought to be, I promise you faithfully. And</a>
<a id='line_30567'>this, Sir Gawaine, methinketh were more fairer, holier, and more better</a>
<a id='line_30568'>to their souls, than ye, my most noble king, and you, Sir Gawaine, to</a>
<a id='line_30569'>war upon me, for thereby shall ye get none avail.</a>
<a id='line_30570'></a>
<a id='line_30571'>Then all knights and ladies that were there wept as they were mad, and</a>
<a id='line_30572'>the tears fell on King Arthur’s cheeks. Sir Launcelot, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_30573'>Gawaine, I have right well heard thy speech, and thy great proffers,</a>
<a id='line_30574'>but wit thou well, let the king do as it pleased him, I will never</a>
<a id='line_30575'>forgive my brothers’ death, and in especial the death of my brother,</a>
<a id='line_30576'>Sir Gareth. And if mine uncle, King Arthur, will accord with thee, he</a>
<a id='line_30577'>shall lose my service, for wit thou well thou art both false to the</a>
<a id='line_30578'>king and to me. Sir, said Launcelot, he beareth not the life that may</a>
<a id='line_30579'>make that good; and if ye, Sir Gawaine, will charge me with so high a</a>
<a id='line_30580'>thing, ye must pardon me, for then needs must I answer you. Nay, said</a>
<a id='line_30581'>Sir Gawaine, we are past that at this time, and that caused the Pope,</a>
<a id='line_30582'>for he hath charged mine uncle, the king, that he shall take his queen</a>
<a id='line_30583'>again, and to accord with thee, Sir Launcelot, as for this season, and</a>
<a id='line_30584'>therefore thou shalt go safe as thou camest. But in this land thou</a>
<a id='line_30585'>shalt not abide past fifteen days, such summons I give thee: so the</a>
<a id='line_30586'>king and we were consented and accorded or thou camest. And else, said</a>
<a id='line_30587'>Sir Gawaine, wit thou well thou shouldst not have come here, but if it</a>
<a id='line_30588'>were maugre thy head. And if it were not for the Pope’s commandment,</a>
<a id='line_30589'>said Sir Gawaine, I should do battle with mine own body against thy</a>
<a id='line_30590'>body, and prove it upon thee, that thou hast been both false unto mine</a>
<a id='line_30591'>uncle King Arthur, and to me both; and that shall I prove upon thy</a>
<a id='line_30592'>body, when thou art departed from hence, wheresomever I find thee.</a>
<a id='line_30593'></a>
<a id='line_30594'></a>
<a id='line_30595'></a>
<a id='line_30596'></a>
<a id='line_30597'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot departed from the king and from Joyous</a>
<a id='line_30598'>Gard over seaward, and what knights went with him.</a>
<a id='line_30599'></a>
<a id='line_30600'></a>
<a id='line_30601'>Then Sir Launcelot sighed, and therewith the tears fell on his cheeks,</a>
<a id='line_30602'>and then he said thus: Alas, most noble Christian realm, whom I have</a>
<a id='line_30603'>loved above all other realms, and in thee I have gotten a great part of</a>
<a id='line_30604'>my worship, and now I shall depart in this wise. Truly me repenteth</a>
<a id='line_30605'>that ever I came in this realm, that should be thus shamefully</a>
<a id='line_30606'>banished, undeserved and causeless; but fortune is so variant, and the</a>
<a id='line_30607'>wheel so moveable, there nis none constant abiding, and that may be</a>
<a id='line_30608'>proved by many old chronicles, of noble Ector, and Troilus, and</a>
<a id='line_30609'>Alisander, the mighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they were most</a>
<a id='line_30610'>in their royalty, they alighted lowest. And so fareth it by me, said</a>
<a id='line_30611'>Sir Launcelot, for in this realm I had worship, and by me and mine all</a>
<a id='line_30612'>the whole Round Table hath been increased more in worship, by me and</a>
<a id='line_30613'>mine blood, than by any other. And therefore wit thou well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30614'>Gawaine, I may live upon my lands as well as any knight that here is.</a>
<a id='line_30615'>And if ye, most redoubted king, will come upon my lands with Sir</a>
<a id='line_30616'>Gawaine to war upon me, I must endure you as well as I may. But as to</a>
<a id='line_30617'>you, Sir Gawaine, if that ye come there, I pray you charge me not with</a>
<a id='line_30618'>treason nor felony, for an ye do, I must answer you. Do thou thy best,</a>
<a id='line_30619'>said Sir Gawaine; therefore hie thee fast that thou were gone, and wit</a>
<a id='line_30620'>thou well we shall soon come after, and break the strongest castle that</a>
<a id='line_30621'>thou hast, upon thy head. That shall not need, said Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_30622'>an I were as orgulous set as ye are, wit you well I should meet you in</a>
<a id='line_30623'>midst of the field. Make thou no more language, said Sir Gawaine, but</a>
<a id='line_30624'>deliver the queen from thee, and pike thee lightly out of this court.</a>
<a id='line_30625'>Well, said Sir Launcelot, an I had wist of this short coming, I would</a>
<a id='line_30626'>have advised me twice or that I had come hither; for an the queen had</a>
<a id='line_30627'>been so dear to me as ye noise her, I durst have kept her from the</a>
<a id='line_30628'>fellowship of the best knights under heaven.</a>
<a id='line_30629'></a>
<a id='line_30630'>And then Sir Launcelot said unto Guenever, in hearing of the king and</a>
<a id='line_30631'>them all: Madam, now I must depart from you and this noble fellowship</a>
<a id='line_30632'>for ever; and sithen it is so, I beseech you to pray for me, and say me</a>
<a id='line_30633'>well; and if ye be hard bestead by any false tongues, lightly my lady</a>
<a id='line_30634'>send me word, and if any knight’s hands may deliver you by battle, I</a>
<a id='line_30635'>shall deliver you. And therewithal Sir Launcelot kissed the queen; and</a>
<a id='line_30636'>then he said all openly. Now let see what he be in this place that dare</a>
<a id='line_30637'>say the queen is not true unto my lord Arthur, let see who will speak</a>
<a id='line_30638'>an he dare speak. And therewith he brought the queen to the king, and</a>
<a id='line_30639'>then Sir Launcelot took his leave and departed; and there was neither</a>
<a id='line_30640'>king, duke, nor earl, baron nor knight, lady nor gentlewoman, but all</a>
<a id='line_30641'>they wept as people out of their mind, except Sir Gawaine. And when the</a>
<a id='line_30642'>noble Sir Launcelot took his horse to ride out of Carlisle, there was</a>
<a id='line_30643'>sobbing and weeping for pure dole of his departing; and so he took his</a>
<a id='line_30644'>way unto Joyous Gard. And then ever after he called it the Dolorous</a>
<a id='line_30645'>Gard. And thus departed Sir Launcelot from the court for ever.</a>
<a id='line_30646'></a>
<a id='line_30647'>And so when he came to Joyous Gard he called his fellowship unto him,</a>
<a id='line_30648'>and asked them what they would do. Then they answered all wholly</a>
<a id='line_30649'>together with one voice they would as he would do. My fair fellows,</a>
<a id='line_30650'>said Sir Launcelot, I must depart out of this most noble realm, and now</a>
<a id='line_30651'>I shall depart it grieveth me sore, for I shall depart with no worship,</a>
<a id='line_30652'>for a flemed man departed never out of a realm with no worship; and</a>
<a id='line_30653'>that is my heaviness, for ever I fear after my days that men shall</a>
<a id='line_30654'>chronicle upon me that I was flemed out of this land; and else, my fair</a>
<a id='line_30655'>lords, be ye sure, an I had not dread shame, my lady, Queen Guenever,</a>
<a id='line_30656'>and I should never have departed.</a>
<a id='line_30657'></a>
<a id='line_30658'>Then spake many noble knights, as Sir Palomides, Sir Safere his</a>
<a id='line_30659'>brother, and Sir Bellingere le Beuse, and Sir Urre, with Sir Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_30660'>with many others: Sir, an ye be so disposed to abide in this land we</a>
<a id='line_30661'>will never fail you; and if ye list not to abide in this land there nis</a>
<a id='line_30662'>none of the good knights that here be will fail you, for many causes.</a>
<a id='line_30663'>One is, all we that be not of your blood shall never be welcome to the</a>
<a id='line_30664'>court. And sithen it liked us to take a part with you in your distress</a>
<a id='line_30665'>and heaviness in this realm, wit you well it shall like us as well to</a>
<a id='line_30666'>go in other countries with you, and there to take such part as ye do.</a>
<a id='line_30667'>My fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, I well understand you, and as I can,</a>
<a id='line_30668'>thank you: and ye shall understand, such livelihood as I am born unto I</a>
<a id='line_30669'>shall depart with you in this manner of wise; that is for to say, I</a>
<a id='line_30670'>shall depart all my livelihood and all my lands freely among you, and I</a>
<a id='line_30671'>myself will have as little as any of you, for have I sufficient that</a>
<a id='line_30672'>may long to my person, I will ask none other rich array; and I trust to</a>
<a id='line_30673'>God to maintain you on my lands as well as ever were maintained any</a>
<a id='line_30674'>knights. Then spake all the knights at once: He have shame that will</a>
<a id='line_30675'>leave you; for we all understand in this realm will be now no quiet,</a>
<a id='line_30676'>but ever strife and debate, now the fellowship of the Round Table is</a>
<a id='line_30677'>broken; for by the noble fellowship of the Round Table was King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_30678'>upborne, and by their noblesse the king and all his realm was in quiet</a>
<a id='line_30679'>and rest, and a great part they said all was because of your noblesse.</a>
<a id='line_30680'></a>

<a id='line_30682'></a>
<a id='line_30683'></a>
<a id='line_30684'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot passed over the sea, and how he made</a>
<a id='line_30685'>great lords of the knights that went with him.</a>
<a id='line_30686'></a>
<a id='line_30687'></a>
<a id='line_30688'>Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you all of your good saying,</a>
<a id='line_30689'>howbeit, I wot well, in me was not all the stability of this realm, but</a>
<a id='line_30690'>in that I might I did my devoir; and well I am sure I knew many</a>
<a id='line_30691'>rebellions in my days that by me were peaced, and I trow we all shall</a>
<a id='line_30692'>hear of them in short space, and that me sore repenteth. For ever I</a>
<a id='line_30693'>dread me, said Sir Launcelot, that Sir Mordred will make trouble, for</a>
<a id='line_30694'>he is passing envious and applieth him to trouble. So they were</a>
<a id='line_30695'>accorded to go with Sir Launcelot to his lands; and to make short tale,</a>
<a id='line_30696'>they trussed, and paid all that would ask them; and wholly an hundred</a>
<a id='line_30697'>knights departed with Sir Launcelot at once, and made their avows they</a>
<a id='line_30698'>would never leave him for weal nor for woe.</a>
<a id='line_30699'></a>
<a id='line_30700'>And so they shipped at Cardiff, and sailed unto Benwick: some men call</a>
<a id='line_30701'>it Bayonne, and some men call it Beaune, where the wine of Beaune is.</a>
<a id='line_30702'>But to say the sooth, Sir Launcelot and his nephews were lords of all</a>
<a id='line_30703'>France, and of all the lands that longed unto France; he and his</a>
<a id='line_30704'>kindred rejoiced it all through Sir Launcelot’s noble prowess. And then</a>
<a id='line_30705'>Sir Launcelot stuffed and furnished and garnished all his noble towns</a>
<a id='line_30706'>and castles. Then all the people of those lands came to Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_30707'>on foot and hands. And so when he had stablished all these countries,</a>
<a id='line_30708'>he shortly called a parliament; and there he crowned Sir Lionel, King</a>
<a id='line_30709'>of France; and Sir Bors [he] crowned him king of all King Claudas’</a>
<a id='line_30710'>lands; and Sir Ector de Maris, that was Sir Launcelot’s youngest</a>
<a id='line_30711'>brother, he crowned him King of Benwick, and king of all Guienne, that</a>
<a id='line_30712'>was Sir Launcelot’s own land. And he made Sir Ector prince of them all,</a>
<a id='line_30713'>and thus he departed.</a>
<a id='line_30714'></a>
<a id='line_30715'>Then Sir Launcelot advanced all his noble knights, and first he</a>
<a id='line_30716'>advanced them of his blood; that was Sir Blamore, he made him Duke of</a>
<a id='line_30717'>Limosin in Guienne and Sir Bleoberis he made him Duke of Poictiers, and</a>
<a id='line_30718'>Sir Gahalantine he made him Duke of Querne, and Sir Galihodin he made</a>
<a id='line_30719'>him Duke of Sentonge, and Sir Galihud he made him Earl of Perigot, and</a>
<a id='line_30720'>Sir Menadeuke he made him Earl of Roerge, and Sir Villiars the Valiant</a>
<a id='line_30721'>he made him Earl of Bearn, and Sir Hebes le Renoumes he made him Earl</a>
<a id='line_30722'>of Comange, and Sir Lavaine he made him Earl of Arminak, and Sir Urre</a>
<a id='line_30723'>he made him Earl of Estrake, and Sir Neroneus he made him Earl of</a>
<a id='line_30724'>Pardiak, and Sir Plenorius he made Earl of Foise, and Sir Selises of</a>
<a id='line_30725'>the Dolorous Tower he made him Earl of Masauke, and Sir Melias de Lile</a>
<a id='line_30726'>he made him Earl of Tursauk, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse he made Earl</a>
<a id='line_30727'>of the Launds, and Sir Palomides he made him Duke of the Provence, and</a>
<a id='line_30728'>Sir Safere he made him Duke of Landok, and Sir Clegis he gave him the</a>
<a id='line_30729'>Earldom of Agente, and Sir Sadok he gave the Earldom of Surlat, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30730'>Dinas le Seneschal he made him Duke of Anjou, and Sir Clarrus he made</a>
<a id='line_30731'>him Duke of Normandy. Thus Sir Launcelot rewarded his noble knights and</a>
<a id='line_30732'>many more, that meseemeth it were too long to rehearse.</a>

<a id='line_30736'></a>
<a id='line_30737'>CHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur and Sir Gawaine made a great host ready to</a>
<a id='line_30738'>go over sea to make war on Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_30739'></a>
<a id='line_30740'></a>
<a id='line_30741'>So leave we Sir Launcelot in his lands, and his noble knights with him,</a>
<a id='line_30742'>and return we again unto King Arthur and to Sir Gawaine, that made a</a>
<a id='line_30743'>great host ready, to the number of threescore thousand; and all thing</a>
<a id='line_30744'>was made ready for their shipping to pass over the sea, and so they</a>
<a id='line_30745'>shipped at Cardiff. And there King Arthur made Sir Mordred chief ruler</a>
<a id='line_30746'>of all England, and also he put Queen Guenever under his governance;</a>
<a id='line_30747'>because Sir Mordred was King Arthur’s son, he gave him the rule of his</a>
<a id='line_30748'>land and of his wife; and so the king passed the sea and landed upon</a>
<a id='line_30749'>Sir Launcelot’s lands, and there he brent and wasted, through the</a>
<a id='line_30750'>vengeance of Sir Gawaine, all that they might overrun.</a>
<a id='line_30751'></a>
<a id='line_30752'>When this word came to Sir Launcelot, that King Arthur and Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_30753'>were landed upon his lands, and made a full great destruction and</a>
<a id='line_30754'>waste, then spake Sir Bors, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, it is</a>
<a id='line_30755'>shame that we suffer them thus to ride over our lands, for wit you</a>
<a id='line_30756'>well, suffer ye them as long as ye will, they will do you no favour an</a>
<a id='line_30757'>they may handle you. Then said Sir Lionel that was wary and wise: My</a>
<a id='line_30758'>lord Sir Launcelot, I will give this counsel, let us keep our strong</a>
<a id='line_30759'>walled towns until they have hunger and cold, and blow on their nails;</a>
<a id='line_30760'>and then let us freshly set upon them, and shred them down as sheep in</a>
<a id='line_30761'>a field, that aliens may take example for ever how they land upon our</a>
<a id='line_30762'>lands.</a>
<a id='line_30763'></a>
<a id='line_30764'>Then spake King Bagdemagus to Sir Launcelot: Sir, your courtesy will</a>
<a id='line_30765'>shende us all, and thy courtesy hath waked all this sorrow; for an they</a>
<a id='line_30766'>thus over our lands ride, they shall by process bring us all to nought</a>
<a id='line_30767'>whilst we thus in holes us hide. Then said Sir Galihud unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_30768'>Launcelot: Sir, here be knights come of kings’ blood, that will not</a>
<a id='line_30769'>long droop, and they are within these walls; therefore give us leave,</a>
<a id='line_30770'>like as we be knights, to meet them in the field, and we shall slay</a>
<a id='line_30771'>them, that they shall curse the time that ever they came into this</a>
<a id='line_30772'>country. Then spake seven brethren of North Wales, and they were seven</a>
<a id='line_30773'>noble knights; a man might seek in seven kings’ lands or he might find</a>
<a id='line_30774'>such seven knights. Then they all said at once: Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_30775'>Christ’s sake let us out ride with Sir Galihud, for we be never wont to</a>
<a id='line_30776'>cower in castles nor in noble towns.</a>
<a id='line_30777'></a>
<a id='line_30778'>Then spake Sir Launcelot, that was master and governor of them all: My</a>
<a id='line_30779'>fair lords, wit you well I am full loath to ride out with my knights</a>
<a id='line_30780'>for shedding of Christian blood; and yet my lands I understand be full</a>
<a id='line_30781'>bare for to sustain any host awhile, for the mighty wars that whilom</a>
<a id='line_30782'>made King Claudas upon this country, upon my father King Ban, and on</a>
<a id='line_30783'>mine uncle King Bors; howbeit we will as at this time keep our strong</a>
<a id='line_30784'>walls, and I shall send a messenger unto my lord Arthur, a treaty for</a>
<a id='line_30785'>to take; for better is peace than always war.</a>
<a id='line_30786'></a>
<a id='line_30787'>So Sir Launcelot sent forth a damosel and a dwarf with her, requiring</a>
<a id='line_30788'>King Arthur to leave his warring upon his lands; and so she start upon</a>
<a id='line_30789'>a palfrey, and the dwarf ran by her side. And when she came to the</a>
<a id='line_30790'>pavilion of King Arthur, there she alighted; and there met her a gentle</a>
<a id='line_30791'>knight, Sir Lucan the Butler, and said: Fair damosel, come ye from Sir</a>
<a id='line_30792'>Launcelot du Lake? Yea sir, she said, therefore I come hither to speak</a>
<a id='line_30793'>with my lord the king. Alas, said Sir Lucan, my lord Arthur would love</a>
<a id='line_30794'>Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine will not suffer him. And then he said: I</a>
<a id='line_30795'>pray to God, damosel, ye may speed well, for all we that be about the</a>
<a id='line_30796'>king would Sir Launcelot did best of any knight living. And so with</a>
<a id='line_30797'>this Lucan led the damosel unto the king where he sat with Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_30798'>for to hear what she would say. So when she had told her tale, the</a>
<a id='line_30799'>water ran out of the king’s eyen, and all the lords were full glad for</a>
<a id='line_30800'>to advise the king as to be accorded with Sir Launcelot, save all only</a>
<a id='line_30801'>Sir Gawaine, and he said: My lord mine uncle, what will ye do? Will ye</a>
<a id='line_30802'>now turn again, now ye are passed thus far upon this journey? all the</a>
<a id='line_30803'>world will speak of your villainy. Nay, said Arthur, wit thou well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30804'>Gawaine, I will do as ye will advise me; and yet meseemeth, said</a>
<a id='line_30805'>Arthur, his fair proffers were not good to be refused; but sithen I am</a>
<a id='line_30806'>come so far upon this journey, I will that ye give the damosel her</a>
<a id='line_30807'>answer, for I may not speak to her for pity, for her proffers be so</a>
<a id='line_30808'>large.</a>
<a id='line_30809'></a>
<a id='line_30810'></a>
<a id='line_30811'></a>
<a id='line_30812'></a>
<a id='line_30813'>CHAPTER XX. What message Sir Gawaine sent to Sir Launcelot; and how</a>
<a id='line_30814'>King Arthur laid siege to Benwick, and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_30815'></a>
<a id='line_30816'></a>
<a id='line_30817'>Then Sir Gawaine said to the damosel thus: Damosel, say ye to Sir</a>
<a id='line_30818'>Launcelot that it is waste labour now to sue to mine uncle; for tell</a>
<a id='line_30819'>him, an he would have made any labour for peace, he should have made it</a>
<a id='line_30820'>or this time, for tell him now it is too late; and say that I, Sir</a>
<a id='line_30821'>Gawaine, so send him word, that I promise him by the faith I owe unto</a>
<a id='line_30822'>God and to knighthood, I shall never leave him till he have slain me or</a>
<a id='line_30823'>I him. So the damosel wept and departed, and there were many weeping</a>
<a id='line_30824'>eyen; and so Sir Lucan brought the damosel to her palfrey, and so she</a>
<a id='line_30825'>came to Sir Launcelot where he was among all his knights. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_30826'>Launcelot had heard this answer, then the tears ran down by his cheeks.</a>
<a id='line_30827'>And then his noble knights strode about him, and said: Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30828'>wherefore make ye such cheer, think what ye are, and what men we are,</a>
<a id='line_30829'>and let us noble knights match them in midst of the field. That may be</a>
<a id='line_30830'>lightly done, said Sir Launcelot, but I was never so loath to do</a>
<a id='line_30831'>battle, and therefore I pray you, fair sirs, as ye love me, be ruled as</a>
<a id='line_30832'>I will have you, for I will always flee that noble king that made me</a>
<a id='line_30833'>knight. And when I may no further, I must needs defend me, and that</a>
<a id='line_30834'>will be more worship for me and us all than to compare with that noble</a>
<a id='line_30835'>king whom we have all served. Then they held their language, and as</a>
<a id='line_30836'>that night they took their rest.</a>
<a id='line_30837'></a>
<a id='line_30838'>And upon the morn early, in the dawning of the day, as knights looked</a>
<a id='line_30839'>out, they saw the city of Benwick besieged round about; and fast they</a>
<a id='line_30840'>began to set up ladders, and then they defied them out of the town, and</a>
<a id='line_30841'>beat them from the walls wightly. Then came forth Sir Gawaine well</a>
<a id='line_30842'>armed upon a stiff steed, and he came before the chief gate, with his</a>
<a id='line_30843'>spear in his hand, crying: Sir Launcelot, where art thou? is there none</a>
<a id='line_30844'>of you proud knights dare break a spear with me? Then Sir Bors made him</a>
<a id='line_30845'>ready, and came forth out of the town, and there Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_30846'>encountered with Sir Bors. And at that time he smote Sir Bors down from</a>
<a id='line_30847'>his horse, and almost he had slain him; and so Sir Bors was rescued and</a>
<a id='line_30848'>borne into the town. Then came forth Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_30849'>and thought to revenge him; and either feutred their spears, and ran</a>
<a id='line_30850'>together; and there they met spitefully, but Sir Gawaine had such grace</a>
<a id='line_30851'>that he smote Sir Lionel down, and wounded him there passing sore; and</a>
<a id='line_30852'>then Sir Lionel was rescued and borne into the town. And this Sir</a>
<a id='line_30853'>Gawaine came every day, and he failed not but that he smote down one</a>
<a id='line_30854'>knight or other.</a>
<a id='line_30855'></a>
<a id='line_30856'>So thus they endured half a year, and much slaughter was of people on</a>
<a id='line_30857'>both parties. Then it befell upon a day, Sir Gawaine came afore the</a>
<a id='line_30858'>gates armed at all pieces on a noble horse, with a great spear in his</a>
<a id='line_30859'>hand; and then he cried with a loud voice: Where art thou now, thou</a>
<a id='line_30860'>false traitor, Sir Launcelot? Why hidest thou thyself within holes and</a>
<a id='line_30861'>walls like a coward? Look out now, thou false traitor knight, and here</a>
<a id='line_30862'>I shall revenge upon thy body the death of my three brethren. All this</a>
<a id='line_30863'>language heard Sir Launcelot every deal; and his kin and his knights</a>
<a id='line_30864'>drew about him, and all they said at once to Sir Launcelot: Sir</a>
<a id='line_30865'>Launcelot, now must ye defend you like a knight, or else ye be shamed</a>
<a id='line_30866'>for ever; for, now ye be called upon treason, it is time for you to</a>
<a id='line_30867'>stir, for ye have slept over-long and suffered over-much. So God me</a>
<a id='line_30868'>help, said Sir Launcelot, I am right heavy of Sir Gawaine’s words, for</a>
<a id='line_30869'>now he charged me with a great charge; and therefore I wot it as well</a>
<a id='line_30870'>as ye, that I must defend me, or else to be recreant.</a>
<a id='line_30871'></a>
<a id='line_30872'>Then Sir Launcelot bade saddle his strongest horse, and bade let fetch</a>
<a id='line_30873'>his arms, and bring all unto the gate of the tower; and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_30874'>Launcelot spake on high unto King Arthur, and said: My lord Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_30875'>noble king that made me knight, wit you well I am right heavy for your</a>
<a id='line_30876'>sake, that ye thus sue upon me; and always I forbare you, for an I</a>
<a id='line_30877'>would have been vengeable, I might have met you in midst of the field,</a>
<a id='line_30878'>and there to have made your boldest knights full tame. And now I have</a>
<a id='line_30879'>forborne half a year, and suffered you and Sir Gawaine to do what ye</a>
<a id='line_30880'>would do; and now may I endure it no longer, for now must I needs</a>
<a id='line_30881'>defend myself, insomuch Sir Gawaine hath appealed me of treason; the</a>
<a id='line_30882'>which is greatly against my will that ever I should fight against any</a>
<a id='line_30883'>of your blood, but now I may not forsake it, I am driven thereto as a</a>
<a id='line_30884'>beast till a bay.</a>
<a id='line_30885'></a>
<a id='line_30886'>Then Sir Gawaine said: Sir Launcelot, an thou durst do battle, leave</a>
<a id='line_30887'>thy babbling and come off, and let us ease our hearts. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_30888'>Launcelot armed him lightly, and mounted upon his horse, and either of</a>
<a id='line_30889'>the knights gat great spears in their hands, and the host without stood</a>
<a id='line_30890'>still all apart, and the noble knights came out of the city by a great</a>
<a id='line_30891'>number, insomuch that when Arthur saw the number of men and knights, he</a>
<a id='line_30892'>marvelled, and said to himself: Alas, that ever Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_30893'>against me, for now I see he hath forborne me. And so the covenant was</a>
<a id='line_30894'>made, there should no man nigh them, nor deal with them, till the one</a>
<a id='line_30895'>were dead or yelden.</a>
<a id='line_30896'></a>
<a id='line_30897'></a>
<a id='line_30898'></a>
<a id='line_30899'></a>
<a id='line_30900'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine did battle together, and</a>
<a id='line_30901'>how Sir Gawaine was overthrown and hurt.</a>
<a id='line_30902'></a>
<a id='line_30903'></a>
<a id='line_30904'>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot departed a great way asunder, and</a>
<a id='line_30905'>then they came together with all their horses’ might as they might run,</a>
<a id='line_30906'>and either smote other in midst of their shields; but the knights were</a>
<a id='line_30907'>so strong, and their spears so big, that their horses might not endure</a>
<a id='line_30908'>their buffets, and so their horses fell to the earth; and then they</a>
<a id='line_30909'>avoided their horses, and dressed their shields afore them. Then they</a>
<a id='line_30910'>stood together and gave many sad strokes on divers places of their</a>
<a id='line_30911'>bodies, that the blood brast out on many sides and places. Then had Sir</a>
<a id='line_30912'>Gawaine such a grace and gift that an holy man had given to him, that</a>
<a id='line_30913'>every day in the year, from underne till high noon, his might increased</a>
<a id='line_30914'>those three hours as much as thrice his strength, and that caused Sir</a>
<a id='line_30915'>Gawaine to win great honour. And for his sake King Arthur made an</a>
<a id='line_30916'>ordinance, that all manner of battles for any quarrels that should be</a>
<a id='line_30917'>done afore King Arthur should begin at underne; and all was done for</a>
<a id='line_30918'>Sir Gawaine’s love, that by likelihood, if Sir Gawaine were on the one</a>
<a id='line_30919'>part, he should have the better in battle while his strength endureth</a>
<a id='line_30920'>three hours; but there were but few knights that time living that knew</a>
<a id='line_30921'>this advantage that Sir Gawaine had, but King Arthur all only.</a>
<a id='line_30922'></a>
<a id='line_30923'>Thus Sir Launcelot fought with Sir Gawaine, and when Sir Launcelot felt</a>
<a id='line_30924'>his might evermore increase, Sir Launcelot wondered and dread him sore</a>
<a id='line_30925'>to be shamed. For as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot weened, when</a>
<a id='line_30926'>he felt Sir Gawaine double his strength, that he had been a fiend and</a>
<a id='line_30927'>none earthly man; wherefore Sir Launcelot traced and traversed, and</a>
<a id='line_30928'>covered himself with his shield, and kept his might and his braide</a>
<a id='line_30929'>during three hours; and that while Sir Gawaine gave him many sad</a>
<a id='line_30930'>brunts, and many sad strokes, that all the knights that beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_30931'>Launcelot marvelled how that he might endure him; but full little</a>
<a id='line_30932'>understood they that travail that Sir Launcelot had for to endure him.</a>
<a id='line_30933'>And then when it was past noon Sir Gawaine had no more but his own</a>
<a id='line_30934'>might. When Sir Launcelot felt him so come down, then he stretched him</a>
<a id='line_30935'>up and stood near Sir Gawaine, and said thus: My lord Sir Gawaine, now</a>
<a id='line_30936'>I feel ye have done; now my lord Sir Gawaine, I must do my part, for</a>
<a id='line_30937'>many great and grievous strokes I have endured you this day with great</a>
<a id='line_30938'>pain.</a>
<a id='line_30939'></a>
<a id='line_30940'>Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes and gave Sir Gawaine such a</a>
<a id='line_30941'>buffet on the helmet that he fell down on his side, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_30942'>withdrew him from him. Why withdrawest thou thee? said Sir Gawaine; now</a>
<a id='line_30943'>turn again, false traitor knight, and slay me, for an thou leave me</a>
<a id='line_30944'>thus, when I am whole I shall do battle with thee again. I shall endure</a>
<a id='line_30945'>you, Sir, by God’s grace, but wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, I will never</a>
<a id='line_30946'>smite a felled knight. And so Sir Launcelot went into the city; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_30947'>Gawaine was borne into King Arthur’s pavilion, and leeches were brought</a>
<a id='line_30948'>to him, and searched and salved with soft ointments. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_30949'>Launcelot said: Now have good day, my lord the king, for wit you well</a>
<a id='line_30950'>ye win no worship at these walls; and if I would my knights outbring,</a>
<a id='line_30951'>there should many a man die. Therefore, my lord Arthur, remember you of</a>
<a id='line_30952'>old kindness; and however I fare, Jesu be your guide in all places.</a>
<a id='line_30953'></a>

<a id='line_30957'>CHAPTER XXII. Of the sorrow that King Arthur made for the war, and of</a>
<a id='line_30958'>another battle where also Sir Gawaine had the worse.</a>
<a id='line_30959'></a>
<a id='line_30960'></a>
<a id='line_30961'>Alas, said the king, that ever this unhappy war was begun; for ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_30962'>Launcelot forbeareth me in all places, and in likewise my kin, and that</a>
<a id='line_30963'>is seen well this day by my nephew Sir Gawaine. Then King Arthur fell</a>
<a id='line_30964'>sick for sorrow of Sir Gawaine, that he was so sore hurt, and because</a>
<a id='line_30965'>of the war betwixt him and Sir Launcelot. So then they on King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_30966'>part kept the siege with little war withoutforth; and they withinforth</a>
<a id='line_30967'>kept their walls, and defended them when need was. Thus Sir Gawaine lay</a>
<a id='line_30968'>sick three weeks in his tents, with all manner of leech-craft that</a>
<a id='line_30969'>might be had. And as soon as Sir Gawaine might go and ride, he armed</a>
<a id='line_30970'>him at all points, and start upon a courser, and gat a spear in his</a>
<a id='line_30971'>hand, and so he came riding afore the chief gate of Benwick; and there</a>
<a id='line_30972'>he cried on height: Where art thou, Sir Launcelot? Come forth, thou</a>
<a id='line_30973'>false traitor knight and recreant, for I am here, Sir Gawaine, will</a>
<a id='line_30974'>prove this that I say on thee.</a>
<a id='line_30975'></a>
<a id='line_30976'>All this language Sir Launcelot heard, and then he said thus: Sir</a>
<a id='line_30977'>Gawaine, me repents of your foul saying, that ye will not cease of your</a>
<a id='line_30978'>language; for you wot well, Sir Gawaine, I know your might and all that</a>
<a id='line_30979'>ye may do; and well ye wot, Sir Gawaine, ye may not greatly hurt me.</a>
<a id='line_30980'>Come down, traitor knight, said he, and make it good the contrary with</a>
<a id='line_30981'>thy hands, for it mishapped me the last battle to be hurt of thy hands;</a>
<a id='line_30982'>therefore wit thou well I am come this day to make amends, for I ween</a>
<a id='line_30983'>this day to lay thee as low as thou laidest me. Jesu defend me, said</a>
<a id='line_30984'>Sir Launcelot, that ever I be so far in your danger as ye have been in</a>
<a id='line_30985'>mine, for then my days were done. But Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_30986'>ye shall not think that I tarry long, but sithen that ye so unknightly</a>
<a id='line_30987'>call me of treason, ye shall have both your hands full of me. And then</a>
<a id='line_30988'>Sir Launcelot armed him at all points, and mounted upon his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_30989'>gat a great spear in his hand, and rode out at the gate. And both the</a>
<a id='line_30990'>hosts were assembled, of them without and of them within, and stood in</a>
<a id='line_30991'>array full manly. And both parties were charged to hold them still, to</a>
<a id='line_30992'>see and behold the battle of these two noble knights. And then they</a>
<a id='line_30993'>laid their spears in their rests, and they came together as thunder,</a>
<a id='line_30994'>and Sir Gawaine brake his spear upon Sir Launcelot in a hundred pieces</a>
<a id='line_30995'>unto his hand; and Sir Launcelot smote him with a greater might, that</a>
<a id='line_30996'>Sir Gawaine’s horse’s feet raised, and so the horse and he fell to the</a>
<a id='line_30997'>earth. Then Sir Gawaine deliverly avoided his horse, and put his shield</a>
<a id='line_30998'>afore him, and eagerly drew his sword, and bade Sir Launcelot: Alight,</a>
<a id='line_30999'>traitor knight, for if this mare’s son hath failed me, wit thou well a</a>
<a id='line_31000'>king’s son and a queen’s son shall not fail thee.</a>
<a id='line_31001'></a>
<a id='line_31002'>Then Sir Launcelot avoided his horse, and dressed his shield afore him,</a>
<a id='line_31003'>and drew his sword; and so stood they together and gave many sad</a>
<a id='line_31004'>strokes, that all men on both parties had thereof passing great wonder.</a>
<a id='line_31005'>But when Sir Launcelot felt Sir Gawaine’s might so marvellously</a>
<a id='line_31006'>increase, he then withheld his courage and his wind, and kept himself</a>
<a id='line_31007'>wonder covert of his might; and under his shield he traced and</a>
<a id='line_31008'>traversed here and there, to break Sir Gawaine’s strokes and his</a>
<a id='line_31009'>courage; and Sir Gawaine enforced himself with all his might and power</a>
<a id='line_31010'>to destroy Sir Launcelot; for as the French book saith, ever as Sir</a>
<a id='line_31011'>Gawaine’s might increased, right so increased his wind and his evil</a>
<a id='line_31012'>will. Thus Sir Gawaine did great pain unto Sir Launcelot three hours,</a>
<a id='line_31013'>that he had right great pain for to defend him.</a>
<a id='line_31014'></a>
<a id='line_31015'>And when the three hours were passed, that Sir Launcelot felt that Sir</a>
<a id='line_31016'>Gawaine was come to his own proper strength, then Sir Launcelot said</a>
<a id='line_31017'>unto Sir Gawaine: Now have I proved you twice, that ye are a full</a>
<a id='line_31018'>dangerous knight, and a wonderful man of your might; and many wonderful</a>
<a id='line_31019'>deeds have ye done in your days, for by your might increasing you have</a>
<a id='line_31020'>deceived many a full noble and valiant knight; and, now I feel that ye</a>
<a id='line_31021'>have done your mighty deeds, now wit you well I must do my deeds. And</a>
<a id='line_31022'>then Sir Launcelot stood near Sir Gawaine, and then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_31023'>doubled his strokes; and Sir Gawaine defended him mightily, but</a>
<a id='line_31024'>nevertheless Sir Launcelot smote such a stroke upon Sir Gawaine’s helm,</a>
<a id='line_31025'>and upon the old wound, that Sir Gawaine sinked down upon his one side</a>
<a id='line_31026'>in a swoon. And anon as he did awake he waved and foined at Sir</a>
<a id='line_31027'>Launcelot as he lay, and said: Traitor knight, wit thou well I am not</a>
<a id='line_31028'>yet slain, come thou near me and perform this battle unto the</a>
<a id='line_31029'>uttermost. I will no more do than I have done, said Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_31030'>when I see you on foot I will do battle upon you all the while I see</a>
<a id='line_31031'>you stand on your feet; but for to smite a wounded man that may not</a>
<a id='line_31032'>stand, God defend me from such a shame. And then he turned him and went</a>
<a id='line_31033'>his way toward the city. And Sir Gawaine evermore calling him traitor</a>
<a id='line_31034'>knight, and said: Wit thou well Sir Launcelot, when I am whole I shall</a>
<a id='line_31035'>do battle with thee again, for I shall never leave thee till that one</a>
<a id='line_31036'>of us be slain. Thus as this siege endured, and as Sir Gawaine lay sick</a>
<a id='line_31037'>near a month; and when he was well recovered and ready within three</a>
<a id='line_31038'>days to do battle again with Sir Launcelot, right so came tidings unto</a>
<a id='line_31039'>Arthur from England that made King Arthur and all his host to remove.</a>

<a id='line_31049'></a>
<a id='line_31050'></a>
<a id='line_31051'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Mordred presumed and took on him to be King of</a>
<a id='line_31052'>England, and would have married the queen, his father’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_31053'></a>
<a id='line_31054'></a>
<a id='line_31055'>As Sir Mordred was ruler of all England, he did do make letters as</a>
<a id='line_31056'>though that they came from beyond the sea, and the letters specified</a>
<a id='line_31057'>that King Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Launcelot. Wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_31058'>Mordred made a parliament, and called the lords together, and there he</a>
<a id='line_31059'>made them to choose him king; and so was he crowned at Canterbury, and</a>
<a id='line_31060'>held a feast there fifteen days; and afterward he drew him unto</a>
<a id='line_31061'>Winchester, and there he took the Queen Guenever, and said plainly that</a>
<a id='line_31062'>he would wed her which was his uncle’s wife and his father’s wife. And</a>
<a id='line_31063'>so he made ready for the feast, and a day prefixed that they should be</a>
<a id='line_31064'>wedded; wherefore Queen Guenever was passing heavy. But she durst not</a>
<a id='line_31065'>discover her heart, but spake fair, and agreed to Sir Mordred’s will.</a>
<a id='line_31066'>Then she desired of Sir Mordred for to go to London, to buy all manner</a>
<a id='line_31067'>of things that longed unto the wedding. And because of her fair speech</a>
<a id='line_31068'>Sir Mordred trusted her well enough, and gave her leave to go. And so</a>
<a id='line_31069'>when she came to London she took the Tower of London, and suddenly in</a>
<a id='line_31070'>all haste possible she stuffed it with all manner of victual, and well</a>
<a id='line_31071'>garnished it with men, and so kept it.</a>
<a id='line_31072'></a>
<a id='line_31073'>Then when Sir Mordred wist and understood how he was beguiled, he was</a>
<a id='line_31074'>passing wroth out of measure. And a short tale for to make, he went and</a>
<a id='line_31075'>laid a mighty siege about the Tower of London, and made many great</a>
<a id='line_31076'>assaults thereat, and threw many great engines unto them, and shot</a>
<a id='line_31077'>great guns. But all might not prevail Sir Mordred, for Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_31078'>would never for fair speech nor for foul, would never trust to come in</a>
<a id='line_31079'>his hands again.</a>
<a id='line_31080'></a>
<a id='line_31081'>Then came the Bishop of Canterbury, the which was a noble clerk and an</a>
<a id='line_31082'>holy man, and thus he said to Sir Mordred: Sir, what will ye do? will</a>
<a id='line_31083'>ye first displease God and sithen shame yourself, and all knighthood?</a>
<a id='line_31084'>Is not King Arthur your uncle, no farther but your mother’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_31085'>and on her himself King Arthur begat you upon his own sister, therefore</a>
<a id='line_31086'>how may you wed your father’s wife? Sir, said the noble clerk, leave</a>
<a id='line_31087'>this opinion or I shall curse you with book and bell and candle. Do</a>
<a id='line_31088'>thou thy worst, said Sir Mordred, wit thou well I shall defy thee. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_31089'>said the Bishop, and wit you well I shall not fear me to do that me</a>
<a id='line_31090'>ought to do. Also where ye noise where my lord Arthur is slain, and</a>
<a id='line_31091'>that is not so, and therefore ye will make a foul work in this land.</a>
<a id='line_31092'>Peace, thou false priest, said Sir Mordred, for an thou chafe me any</a>
<a id='line_31093'>more I shall make strike off thy head. So the Bishop departed and did</a>
<a id='line_31094'>the cursing in the most orgulist wise that might be done. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_31095'>Mordred sought the Bishop of Canterbury, for to have slain him. Then</a>
<a id='line_31096'>the Bishop fled, and took part of his goods with him, and went nigh</a>
<a id='line_31097'>unto Glastonbury; and there he was as priest hermit in a chapel, and</a>
<a id='line_31098'>lived in poverty and in holy prayers, for well he understood that</a>
<a id='line_31099'>mischievous war was at hand.</a>
<a id='line_31100'></a>
<a id='line_31101'>Then Sir Mordred sought on Queen Guenever by letters and sonds, and by</a>
<a id='line_31102'>fair means and foul means, for to have her to come out of the Tower of</a>
<a id='line_31103'>London; but all this availed not, for she answered him shortly, openly</a>
<a id='line_31104'>and privily, that she had liefer slay herself than to be married with</a>
<a id='line_31105'>him. Then came word to Sir Mordred that King Arthur had araised the</a>
<a id='line_31106'>siege for Sir Launcelot, and he was coming homeward with a great host,</a>
<a id='line_31107'>to be avenged upon Sir Mordred; wherefore Sir Mordred made write writs</a>
<a id='line_31108'>to all the barony of this land, and much people drew to him. For then</a>
<a id='line_31109'>was the common voice among them that with Arthur was none other life</a>
<a id='line_31110'>but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss. Thus</a>
<a id='line_31111'>was Sir Arthur depraved, and evil said of. And many there were that</a>
<a id='line_31112'>King Arthur had made up of nought, and given them lands, might not then</a>
<a id='line_31113'>say him a good word. Lo ye all Englishmen, see ye not what a mischief</a>
<a id='line_31114'>here was! for he that was the most king and knight of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_31115'>most loved the fellowship of noble knights, and by him they were all</a>
<a id='line_31116'>upholden, now might not these Englishmen hold them content with him. Lo</a>
<a id='line_31117'>thus was the old custom and usage of this land; and also men say that</a>
<a id='line_31118'>we of this land have not yet lost nor forgotten that custom and usage.</a>
<a id='line_31119'>Alas, this is a great default of us Englishmen, for there may no thing</a>
<a id='line_31120'>please us no term. And so fared the people at that time, they were</a>
<a id='line_31121'>better pleased with Sir Mordred than they were with King Arthur; and</a>
<a id='line_31122'>much people drew unto Sir Mordred, and said they would abide with him</a>
<a id='line_31123'>for better and for worse. And so Sir Mordred drew with a great host to</a>
<a id='line_31124'>Dover, for there he heard say that Sir Arthur would arrive, and so he</a>
<a id='line_31125'>thought to beat his own father from his lands; and the most part of all</a>
<a id='line_31126'>England held with Sir Mordred, the people were so new-fangle.</a>
<a id='line_31127'></a>
<a id='line_31128'></a>
<a id='line_31129'></a>
<a id='line_31130'></a>
<a id='line_31131'>CHAPTER II. How after that King Arthur had tidings, he returned and</a>
<a id='line_31132'>came to Dover, where Sir Mordred met him to let his landing; and of the</a>
<a id='line_31133'>death of Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_31134'></a>
<a id='line_31135'></a>
<a id='line_31136'>And so as Sir Mordred was at Dover with his host, there came King</a>
<a id='line_31137'>Arthur with a great navy of ships, and galleys, and carracks. And there</a>
<a id='line_31138'>was Sir Mordred ready awaiting upon his landing, to let his own father</a>
<a id='line_31139'>to land upon the land that he was king over. Then there was launching</a>
<a id='line_31140'>of great boats and small, and full of noble men of arms; and there was</a>
<a id='line_31141'>much slaughter of gentle knights, and many a full bold baron was laid</a>
<a id='line_31142'>full low, on both parties. But King Arthur was so courageous that there</a>
<a id='line_31143'>might no manner of knights let him to land, and his knights fiercely</a>
<a id='line_31144'>followed him; and so they landed maugre Sir Mordred and all his power,</a>
<a id='line_31145'>and put Sir Mordred aback, that he fled and all his people.</a>
<a id='line_31146'></a>
<a id='line_31147'>So when this battle was done, King Arthur let bury his people that were</a>
<a id='line_31148'>dead. And then was noble Sir Gawaine found in a great boat, lying more</a>
<a id='line_31149'>than half dead. When Sir Arthur wist that Sir Gawaine was laid so low;</a>
<a id='line_31150'>he went unto him; and there the king made sorrow out of measure, and</a>
<a id='line_31151'>took Sir Gawaine in his arms, and thrice he there swooned. And then</a>
<a id='line_31152'>when he awaked, he said: Alas, Sir Gawaine, my sister’s son, here now</a>
<a id='line_31153'>thou liest; the man in the world that I loved most; and now is my joy</a>
<a id='line_31154'>gone, for now, my nephew Sir Gawaine, I will discover me unto your</a>
<a id='line_31155'>person: in Sir Launcelot and you I most had my joy, and mine affiance,</a>
<a id='line_31156'>and now have I lost my joy of you both; wherefore all mine earthly joy</a>
<a id='line_31157'>is gone from me. Mine uncle King Arthur, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well</a>
<a id='line_31158'>my death-day is come, and all is through mine own hastiness and</a>
<a id='line_31159'>wilfulness; for I am smitten upon the old wound the which Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_31160'>gave me, on the which I feel well I must die; and had Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_31161'>been with you as he was, this unhappy war had never begun; and of all</a>
<a id='line_31162'>this am I causer, for Sir Launcelot and his blood, through their</a>
<a id='line_31163'>prowess, held all your cankered enemies in subjection and daunger. And</a>
<a id='line_31164'>now, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall miss Sir Launcelot. But alas, I would</a>
<a id='line_31165'>not accord with him, and therefore, said Sir Gawaine, I pray you, fair</a>
<a id='line_31166'>uncle, that I may have paper, pen, and ink, that I may write to Sir</a>
<a id='line_31167'>Launcelot a cedle with mine own hands.</a>
<a id='line_31168'></a>
<a id='line_31169'>And then when paper and ink was brought, then Gawaine was set up weakly</a>
<a id='line_31170'>by King Arthur, for he was shriven a little to-fore; and then he wrote</a>
<a id='line_31171'>thus, as the French book maketh mention: Unto Sir Launcelot, flower of</a>
<a id='line_31172'>all noble knights that ever I heard of or saw by my days, I, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31173'>Gawaine, King Lot’s son of Orkney, sister’s son unto the noble King</a>
<a id='line_31174'>Arthur, send thee greeting, and let thee have knowledge that the tenth</a>
<a id='line_31175'>day of May I was smitten upon the old wound that thou gavest me afore</a>
<a id='line_31176'>the city of Benwick, and through the same wound that thou gavest me I</a>
<a id='line_31177'>am come to my death-day. And I will that all the world wit, that I, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31178'>Gawaine, knight of the Table Round, sought my death, and not through</a>
<a id='line_31179'>thy deserving, but it was mine own seeking; wherefore I beseech thee,</a>
<a id='line_31180'>Sir Launcelot, to return again unto this realm, and see my tomb, and</a>
<a id='line_31181'>pray some prayer more or less for my soul. And this same day that I</a>
<a id='line_31182'>wrote this cedle, I was hurt to the death in the same wound, the which</a>
<a id='line_31183'>I had of thy hand, Sir Launcelot; for of a more nobler man might I not</a>
<a id='line_31184'>be slain. Also Sir Launcelot, for all the love that ever was betwixt</a>
<a id='line_31185'>us, make no tarrying, but come over the sea in all haste, that thou</a>
<a id='line_31186'>mayst with thy noble knights rescue that noble king that made thee</a>
<a id='line_31187'>knight, that is my lord Arthur; for he is full straitly bestead with a</a>
<a id='line_31188'>false traitor, that is my half-brother, Sir Mordred; and he hath let</a>
<a id='line_31189'>crown him king, and would have wedded my lady Queen Guenever, and so</a>
<a id='line_31190'>had he done had she not put herself in the Tower of London. And so the</a>
<a id='line_31191'>tenth day of May last past, my lord Arthur and we all landed upon them</a>
<a id='line_31192'>at Dover; and there we put that false traitor, Sir Mordred, to flight,</a>
<a id='line_31193'>and there it misfortuned me to be stricken upon thy stroke. And at the</a>
<a id='line_31194'>date of this letter was written, but two hours and a half afore my</a>
<a id='line_31195'>death, written with mine own hand, and so subscribed with part of my</a>
<a id='line_31196'>heart’s blood. And I require thee, most famous knight of the world,</a>
<a id='line_31197'>that thou wilt see my tomb. And then Sir Gawaine wept, and King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_31198'>wept; and then they swooned both. And when they awaked both, the king</a>
<a id='line_31199'>made Sir Gawaine to receive his Saviour. And then Sir Gawaine prayed</a>
<a id='line_31200'>the king for to send for Sir Launcelot, and to cherish him above all</a>
<a id='line_31201'>other knights.</a>
<a id='line_31202'></a>
<a id='line_31203'>And so at the hour of noon Sir Gawaine yielded up the spirit; and then</a>
<a id='line_31204'>the king let inter him in a chapel within Dover Castle; and there yet</a>
<a id='line_31205'>all men may see the skull of him, and the same wound is seen that Sir</a>
<a id='line_31206'>Launcelot gave him in battle. Then was it told the king that Sir</a>
<a id='line_31207'>Mordred had pight a new field upon Barham Down. And upon the morn the</a>
<a id='line_31208'>king rode thither to him, and there was a great battle betwixt them,</a>
<a id='line_31209'>and much people was slain on both parties; but at the last Sir Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_31210'>party stood best, and Sir Mordred and his party fled unto Canterbury.</a>
<a id='line_31211'></a>
<a id='line_31212'></a>
<a id='line_31213'></a>
<a id='line_31214'></a>
<a id='line_31215'>CHAPTER III. How after, Sir Gawaine’s ghost appeared to King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_31216'>and warned him that he should not fight that day.</a>
<a id='line_31217'></a>
<a id='line_31218'></a>
<a id='line_31219'>And then the king let search all the towns for his knights that were</a>
<a id='line_31220'>slain, and interred them; and salved them with soft salves that so sore</a>
<a id='line_31221'>were wounded. Then much people drew unto King Arthur. And then they</a>
<a id='line_31222'>said that Sir Mordred warred upon King Arthur with wrong. And then King</a>
<a id='line_31223'>Arthur drew him with his host down by the seaside, westward toward</a>
<a id='line_31224'>Salisbury; and there was a day assigned betwixt King Arthur and Sir</a>
<a id='line_31225'>Mordred, that they should meet upon a down beside Salisbury, and not</a>
<a id='line_31226'>far from the seaside; and this day was assigned on a Monday after</a>
<a id='line_31227'>Trinity Sunday, whereof King Arthur was passing glad, that he might be</a>
<a id='line_31228'>avenged upon Sir Mordred. Then Sir Mordred araised much people about</a>
<a id='line_31229'>London, for they of Kent, Southsex, and Surrey, Estsex, and of</a>
<a id='line_31230'>Southfolk, and of Northfolk, held the most part with Sir Mordred; and</a>
<a id='line_31231'>many a full noble knight drew unto Sir Mordred and to the king: but</a>
<a id='line_31232'>they that loved Sir Launcelot drew unto Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_31233'></a>
<a id='line_31234'>So upon Trinity Sunday at night, King Arthur dreamed a wonderful dream,</a>
<a id='line_31235'>and that was this: that him seemed he sat upon a chaflet in a chair,</a>
<a id='line_31236'>and the chair was fast to a wheel, and thereupon sat King Arthur in the</a>
<a id='line_31237'>richest cloth of gold that might be made; and the king thought there</a>
<a id='line_31238'>was under him, far from him, an hideous deep black water, and therein</a>
<a id='line_31239'>were all manner of serpents, and worms, and wild beasts, foul and</a>
<a id='line_31240'>horrible; and suddenly the king thought the wheel turned up-so-down,</a>
<a id='line_31241'>and he fell among the serpents, and every beast took him by a limb; and</a>
<a id='line_31242'>then the king cried as he lay in his bed and slept: Help. And then</a>
<a id='line_31243'>knights, squires, and yeomen, awaked the king; and then he was so</a>
<a id='line_31244'>amazed that he wist not where he was; and then he fell a-slumbering</a>
<a id='line_31245'>again, not sleeping nor thoroughly waking. So the king seemed verily</a>
<a id='line_31246'>that there came Sir Gawaine unto him with a number of fair ladies with</a>
<a id='line_31247'>him. And when King Arthur saw him, then he said: Welcome, my sister’s</a>
<a id='line_31248'>son; I weened thou hadst been dead, and now I see thee alive, much am I</a>
<a id='line_31249'>beholding unto Almighty Jesu. O fair nephew and my sister’s son, what</a>
<a id='line_31250'>be these ladies that hither be come with you? Sir, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_31251'>all these be ladies for whom I have foughten when I was man living, and</a>
<a id='line_31252'>all these are those that I did battle for in righteous quarrel; and God</a>
<a id='line_31253'>hath given them that grace at their great prayer, because I did battle</a>
<a id='line_31254'>for them, that they should bring me hither unto you: thus much hath God</a>
<a id='line_31255'>given me leave, for to warn you of your death; for an ye fight as</a>
<a id='line_31256'>to-morn with Sir Mordred, as ye both have assigned, doubt ye not ye</a>
<a id='line_31257'>must be slain, and the most part of your people on both parties. And</a>
<a id='line_31258'>for the great grace and goodness that almighty Jesu hath unto you, and</a>
<a id='line_31259'>for pity of you, and many more other good men there shall be slain, God</a>
<a id='line_31260'>hath sent me to you of his special grace, to give you warning that in</a>
<a id='line_31261'>no wise ye do battle as to-morn, but that ye take a treaty for a month</a>
<a id='line_31262'>day; and proffer you largely, so as to-morn to be put in a delay. For</a>
<a id='line_31263'>within a month shall come Sir Launcelot with all his noble knights, and</a>
<a id='line_31264'>rescue you worshipfully, and slay Sir Mordred, and all that ever will</a>
<a id='line_31265'>hold with him. Then Sir Gawaine and all the ladies vanished.</a>
<a id='line_31266'></a>
<a id='line_31267'>And anon the king called upon his knights, squires, and yeomen, and</a>
<a id='line_31268'>charged them wightly to fetch his noble lords and wise bishops unto</a>
<a id='line_31269'>him. And when they were come, the king told them his avision, what Sir</a>
<a id='line_31270'>Gawaine had told him, and warned him that if he fought on the morn he</a>
<a id='line_31271'>should be slain. Then the king commanded Sir Lucan the Butler, and his</a>
<a id='line_31272'>brother Sir Bedivere, with two bishops with them, and charged them in</a>
<a id='line_31273'>any wise, an they might, Take a treaty for a month day with Sir</a>
<a id='line_31274'>Mordred, and spare not, proffer him lands and goods as much as ye think</a>
<a id='line_31275'>best. So then they departed, and came to Sir Mordred, where he had a</a>
<a id='line_31276'>grim host of an hundred thousand men. And there they entreated Sir</a>
<a id='line_31277'>Mordred long time; and at the last Sir Mordred was agreed for to have</a>
<a id='line_31278'>Cornwall and Kent, by Arthur’s days: after, all England, after the days</a>
<a id='line_31279'>of King Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_31284'>CHAPTER IV. How by misadventure of an adder the battle began, where</a>
<a id='line_31285'>Mordred was slain, and Arthur hurt to the death.</a>
<a id='line_31286'></a>
<a id='line_31287'></a>
<a id='line_31288'>Then were they condescended that King Arthur and Sir Mordred should</a>
<a id='line_31289'>meet betwixt both their hosts, and everych of them should bring</a>
<a id='line_31290'>fourteen persons; and they came with this word unto Arthur. Then said</a>
<a id='line_31291'>he: I am glad that this is done: and so he went into the field. And</a>
<a id='line_31292'>when Arthur should depart, he warned all his host that an they see any</a>
<a id='line_31293'>sword drawn: Look ye come on fiercely, and slay that traitor, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31294'>Mordred, for I in no wise trust him. In like wise Sir Mordred warned</a>
<a id='line_31295'>his host that: An ye see any sword drawn, look that ye come on</a>
<a id='line_31296'>fiercely, and so slay all that ever before you standeth; for in no wise</a>
<a id='line_31297'>I will not trust for this treaty, for I know well my father will be</a>
<a id='line_31298'>avenged on me. And so they met as their appointment was, and so they</a>
<a id='line_31299'>were agreed and accorded thoroughly; and wine was fetched, and they</a>
<a id='line_31300'>drank. Right soon came an adder out of a little heath bush, and it</a>
<a id='line_31301'>stung a knight on the foot. And when the knight felt him stung, he</a>
<a id='line_31302'>looked down and saw the adder, and then he drew his sword to slay the</a>
<a id='line_31303'>adder, and thought of none other harm. And when the host on both</a>
<a id='line_31304'>parties saw that sword drawn, then they blew beams, trumpets, and</a>
<a id='line_31305'>horns, and shouted grimly. And so both hosts dressed them together. And</a>
<a id='line_31306'>King Arthur took his horse, and said: Alas this unhappy day! and so</a>
<a id='line_31307'>rode to his party. And Sir Mordred in like wise. And never was there</a>
<a id='line_31308'>seen a more dolefuller battle in no Christian land; for there was but</a>
<a id='line_31309'>rushing and riding, foining and striking, and many a grim word was</a>
<a id='line_31310'>there spoken either to other, and many a deadly stroke. But ever King</a>
<a id='line_31311'>Arthur rode throughout the battle of Sir Mordred many times, and did</a>
<a id='line_31312'>full nobly as a noble king should, and at all times he fainted never;</a>
<a id='line_31313'>and Sir Mordred that day put him in devoir, and in great peril. And</a>
<a id='line_31314'>thus they fought all the long day, and never stinted till the noble</a>
<a id='line_31315'>knights were laid to the cold earth; and ever they fought still till it</a>
<a id='line_31316'>was near night, and by that time was there an hundred thousand laid</a>
<a id='line_31317'>dead upon the down. Then was Arthur wood wroth out of measure, when he</a>
<a id='line_31318'>saw his people so slain from him.</a>
<a id='line_31319'></a>
<a id='line_31320'>Then the king looked about him, and then was he ware, of all his host</a>
<a id='line_31321'>and of all his good knights, were left no more alive but two knights;</a>
<a id='line_31322'>that one was Sir Lucan the Butler, and his brother Sir Bedivere, and</a>
<a id='line_31323'>they were full sore wounded. Jesu mercy, said the king, where are all</a>
<a id='line_31324'>my noble knights become? Alas that ever I should see this doleful day,</a>
<a id='line_31325'>for now, said Arthur, I am come to mine end. But would to God that I</a>
<a id='line_31326'>wist where were that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all this</a>
<a id='line_31327'>mischief. Then was King Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his</a>
<a id='line_31328'>sword among a great heap of dead men. Now give me my spear, said Arthur</a>
<a id='line_31329'>unto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the traitor that all this woe</a>
<a id='line_31330'>hath wrought. Sir, let him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and</a>
<a id='line_31331'>if ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well revenged upon him.</a>
<a id='line_31332'>Good lord, remember ye of your night’s dream, and what the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_31333'>Sir Gawaine told you this night, yet God of his great goodness hath</a>
<a id='line_31334'>preserved you hitherto. Therefore, for God’s sake, my lord, leave off</a>
<a id='line_31335'>by this, for blessed be God ye have won the field, for here we be three</a>
<a id='line_31336'>alive, and with Sir Mordred is none alive; and if ye leave off now this</a>
<a id='line_31337'>wicked day of destiny is past. Tide me death, betide me life, saith the</a>
<a id='line_31338'>king, now I see him yonder alone he shall never escape mine hands, for</a>
<a id='line_31339'>at a better avail shall I never have him. God speed you well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_31340'>Bedivere.</a>
<a id='line_31341'></a>
<a id='line_31342'>Then the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran toward Sir</a>
<a id='line_31343'>Mordred, crying: Traitor, now is thy death-day come. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_31344'>Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until him with his sword drawn in his</a>
<a id='line_31345'>hand. And there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield, with a</a>
<a id='line_31346'>foin of his spear, throughout the body, more than a fathom. And when</a>
<a id='line_31347'>Sir Mordred felt that he had his death wound he thrust himself with the</a>
<a id='line_31348'>might that he had up to the bur of King Arthur’s spear. And right so he</a>
<a id='line_31349'>smote his father Arthur, with his sword holden in both his hands, on</a>
<a id='line_31350'>the side of the head, that the sword pierced the helmet and the</a>
<a id='line_31351'>brain-pan, and therewithal Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth;</a>
<a id='line_31352'>and the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned</a>
<a id='line_31353'>ofttimes. And Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedivere ofttimes heaved him</a>
<a id='line_31354'>up. And so weakly they led him betwixt them both, to a little chapel</a>
<a id='line_31355'>not far from the seaside. And when the king was there he thought him</a>
<a id='line_31356'>well eased.</a>
<a id='line_31357'></a>
<a id='line_31358'>Then heard they people cry in the field. Now go thou, Sir Lucan, said</a>
<a id='line_31359'>the king, and do me to wit what betokens that noise in the field. So</a>
<a id='line_31360'>Sir Lucan departed, for he was grievously wounded in many places. And</a>
<a id='line_31361'>so as he yede, he saw and hearkened by the moonlight, how that pillers</a>
<a id='line_31362'>and robbers were come into the field, to pill and to rob many a full</a>
<a id='line_31363'>noble knight of brooches, and beads, of many a good ring, and of many a</a>
<a id='line_31364'>rich jewel; and who that were not dead all out, there they slew them</a>
<a id='line_31365'>for their harness and their riches. When Sir Lucan understood this</a>
<a id='line_31366'>work, he came to the king as soon as he might, and told him all what he</a>
<a id='line_31367'>had heard and seen. Therefore by my rede, said Sir Lucan, it is best</a>
<a id='line_31368'>that we bring you to some town. I would it were so, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_31369'></a>
<a id='line_31370'></a>
<a id='line_31371'></a>
<a id='line_31372'></a>
<a id='line_31373'>CHAPTER V. How King Arthur commanded to cast his sword Excalibur into</a>
<a id='line_31374'>the water, and how he was delivered to ladies in a barge.</a>
<a id='line_31375'></a>
<a id='line_31376'></a>
<a id='line_31377'>But I may not stand, mine head works so. Ah Sir Launcelot, said King</a>
<a id='line_31378'>Arthur, this day have I sore missed thee: alas, that ever I was against</a>
<a id='line_31379'>thee, for now have I my death, whereof Sir Gawaine me warned in my</a>
<a id='line_31380'>dream. Then Sir Lucan took up the king the one part, and Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_31381'>the other part, and in the lifting the king swooned; and Sir Lucan fell</a>
<a id='line_31382'>in a swoon with the lift, that the part of his guts fell out of his</a>
<a id='line_31383'>body, and therewith the noble knight’s heart brast. And when the king</a>
<a id='line_31384'>awoke, he beheld Sir Lucan, how he lay foaming at the mouth, and part</a>
<a id='line_31385'>of his guts lay at his feet. Alas, said the king, this is to me a full</a>
<a id='line_31386'>heavy sight, to see this noble duke so die for my sake, for he would</a>
<a id='line_31387'>have holpen me, that had more need of help than I. Alas, he would not</a>
<a id='line_31388'>complain him, his heart was so set to help me: now Jesu have mercy upon</a>
<a id='line_31389'>his soul! Then Sir Bedivere wept for the death of his brother. Leave</a>
<a id='line_31390'>this mourning and weeping, said the king, for all this will not avail</a>
<a id='line_31391'>me, for wit thou well an I might live myself, the death of Sir Lucan</a>
<a id='line_31392'>would grieve me evermore; but my time hieth fast, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_31393'>Therefore, said Arthur unto Sir Bedivere, take thou Excalibur, my good</a>
<a id='line_31394'>sword, and go with it to yonder water side, and when thou comest there</a>
<a id='line_31395'>I charge thee throw my sword in that water, and come again and tell me</a>
<a id='line_31396'>what thou there seest. My lord, said Bedivere, your commandment shall</a>
<a id='line_31397'>be done, and lightly bring you word again.</a>
<a id='line_31398'></a>
<a id='line_31399'>So Sir Bedivere departed, and by the way he beheld that noble sword,</a>
<a id='line_31400'>that the pommel and the haft was all of precious stones; and then he</a>
<a id='line_31401'>said to himself: If I throw this rich sword in the water, thereof shall</a>
<a id='line_31402'>never come good, but harm and loss. And then Sir Bedivere hid Excalibur</a>
<a id='line_31403'>under a tree. And so, as soon as he might, he came again unto the king,</a>
<a id='line_31404'>and said he had been at the water, and had thrown the sword in the</a>
<a id='line_31405'>water. What saw thou there? said the king. Sir, he said, I saw nothing</a>
<a id='line_31406'>but waves and winds. That is untruly said of thee, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_31407'>therefore go thou lightly again, and do my commandment; as thou art to</a>
<a id='line_31408'>me lief and dear, spare not, but throw it in. Then Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_31409'>returned again, and took the sword in his hand; and then him thought</a>
<a id='line_31410'>sin and shame to throw away that noble sword, and so eft he hid the</a>
<a id='line_31411'>sword, and returned again, and told to the king that he had been at the</a>
<a id='line_31412'>water, and done his commandment. What saw thou there? said the king.</a>
<a id='line_31413'>Sir, he said, I saw nothing but the waters wap and waves wan. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_31414'>traitor untrue, said King Arthur, now hast thou betrayed me twice. Who</a>
<a id='line_31415'>would have weened that, thou that hast been to me so lief and dear? and</a>
<a id='line_31416'>thou art named a noble knight, and would betray me for the richness of</a>
<a id='line_31417'>the sword. But now go again lightly, for thy long tarrying putteth me</a>
<a id='line_31418'>in great jeopardy of my life, for I have taken cold. And but if thou do</a>
<a id='line_31419'>now as I bid thee, if ever I may see thee, I shall slay thee with mine</a>
<a id='line_31420'>own hands; for thou wouldst for my rich sword see me dead.</a>
<a id='line_31421'></a>
<a id='line_31422'>Then Sir Bedivere departed, and went to the sword, and lightly took it</a>
<a id='line_31423'>up, and went to the water side; and there he bound the girdle about the</a>
<a id='line_31424'>hilts, and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might;</a>
<a id='line_31425'>and there came an arm and an hand above the water and met it, and</a>
<a id='line_31426'>caught it, and so shook it thrice and brandished, and then vanished</a>
<a id='line_31427'>away the hand with the sword in the water. So Sir Bedivere came again</a>
<a id='line_31428'>to the king, and told him what he saw. Alas, said the king, help me</a>
<a id='line_31429'>hence, for I dread me I have tarried over long. Then Sir Bedivere took</a>
<a id='line_31430'>the king upon his back, and so went with him to that water side. And</a>
<a id='line_31431'>when they were at the water side, even fast by the bank hoved a little</a>
<a id='line_31432'>barge with many fair ladies in it, and among them all was a queen, and</a>
<a id='line_31433'>all they had black hoods, and all they wept and shrieked when they saw</a>
<a id='line_31434'>King Arthur. Now put me into the barge, said the king. And so he did</a>
<a id='line_31435'>softly; and there received him three queens with great mourning; and so</a>
<a id='line_31436'>they set them down, and in one of their laps King Arthur laid his head.</a>
<a id='line_31437'>And then that queen said: Ah, dear brother, why have ye tarried so long</a>
<a id='line_31438'>from me? alas, this wound on your head hath caught over-much cold. And</a>
<a id='line_31439'>so then they rowed from the land, and Sir Bedivere beheld all those</a>
<a id='line_31440'>ladies go from him. Then Sir Bedivere cried: Ah my lord Arthur, what</a>
<a id='line_31441'>shall become of me, now ye go from me and leave me here alone among</a>
<a id='line_31442'>mine enemies? Comfort thyself, said the king, and do as well as thou</a>
<a id='line_31443'>mayst, for in me is no trust for to trust in; for I will into the vale</a>
<a id='line_31444'>of Avilion to heal me of my grievous wound: and if thou hear never more</a>
<a id='line_31445'>of me, pray for my soul. But ever the queens and ladies wept and</a>
<a id='line_31446'>shrieked, that it was pity to hear. And as soon as Sir Bedivere had</a>
<a id='line_31447'>lost the sight of the barge, he wept and wailed, and so took the</a>
<a id='line_31448'>forest; and so he went all that night, and in the morning he was ware</a>
<a id='line_31449'>betwixt two holts hoar, of a chapel and an hermitage.</a>
<a id='line_31450'></a>

<a id='line_31455'>hermitage, and how he abode there with the hermit.</a>
<a id='line_31456'></a>
<a id='line_31457'></a>
<a id='line_31458'>Then was Sir Bedivere glad, and thither he went; and when he came into</a>
<a id='line_31459'>the chapel, he saw where lay an hermit grovelling on all four, there</a>
<a id='line_31460'>fast by a tomb was new graven. When the hermit saw Sir Bedivere he knew</a>
<a id='line_31461'>him well, for he was but little to-fore Bishop of Canterbury, that Sir</a>
<a id='line_31462'>Mordred flemed. Sir, said Bedivere, what man is there interred that ye</a>
<a id='line_31463'>pray so fast for? Fair son, said the hermit, I wot not verily, but by</a>
<a id='line_31464'>deeming. But this night, at midnight, here came a number of ladies, and</a>
<a id='line_31465'>brought hither a dead corpse, and prayed me to bury him; and here they</a>
<a id='line_31466'>offered an hundred tapers, and they gave me an hundred besants. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_31467'>said Sir Bedivere, that was my lord King Arthur, that here lieth buried</a>
<a id='line_31468'>in this chapel. Then Sir Bedivere swooned; and when he awoke he prayed</a>
<a id='line_31469'>the hermit he might abide with him still there, to live with fasting</a>
<a id='line_31470'>and prayers. For from hence will I never go, said Sir Bedivere, by my</a>
<a id='line_31471'>will, but all the days of my life here to pray for my lord Arthur. Ye</a>
<a id='line_31472'>are welcome to me, said the hermit, for I know ye better than ye ween</a>
<a id='line_31473'>that I do. Ye are the bold Bedivere, and the full noble duke, Sir Lucan</a>
<a id='line_31474'>the Butler, was your brother. Then Sir Bedivere told the hermit all as</a>
<a id='line_31475'>ye have heard to-fore. So there bode Sir Bedivere with the hermit that</a>
<a id='line_31476'>was to-fore Bishop of Canterbury, and there Sir Bedivere put upon him</a>
<a id='line_31477'>poor clothes, and served the hermit full lowly in fasting and in</a>
<a id='line_31478'>prayers.</a>
<a id='line_31479'></a>
<a id='line_31480'>Thus of Arthur I find never more written in books that be authorised,</a>
<a id='line_31481'>nor more of the very certainty of his death heard I never read, but</a>
<a id='line_31482'>thus was he led away in a ship wherein were three queens; that one was</a>
<a id='line_31483'>King Arthur’s sister, Queen Morgan le Fay; the other was the Queen of</a>
<a id='line_31484'>Northgalis; the third was the Queen of the Waste Lands. Also there was</a>
<a id='line_31485'>Nimue, the chief lady of the lake, that had wedded Pelleas the good</a>
<a id='line_31486'>knight; and this lady had done much for King Arthur, for she would</a>
<a id='line_31487'>never suffer Sir Pelleas to be in no place where he should be in danger</a>
<a id='line_31488'>of his life; and so he lived to the uttermost of his days with her in</a>
<a id='line_31489'>great rest. More of the death of King Arthur could I never find, but</a>
<a id='line_31490'>that ladies brought him to his burials; and such one was buried there,</a>
<a id='line_31491'>that the hermit bare witness that sometime was Bishop of Canterbury,</a>
<a id='line_31492'>but yet the hermit knew not in certain that he was verily the body of</a>
<a id='line_31493'>King Arthur: for this tale Sir Bedivere, knight of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_31494'>made it to be written.</a>

<a id='line_31502'></a>
<a id='line_31503'>Yet some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead,</a>
<a id='line_31504'>but had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say</a>
<a id='line_31505'>that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I will not</a>
<a id='line_31506'>say it shall be so, but rather I will say: here in this world he</a>
<a id='line_31507'>changed his life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb</a>
<a id='line_31508'>this verse: _Hic jacet Arthurus, Rex quondam, Rexque futurus._ Thus</a>
<a id='line_31509'>leave I here Sir Bedivere with the hermit, that dwelled that time in a</a>

<a id='line_31511'>lived in their prayers, and fastings, and great abstinence. And when</a>
<a id='line_31512'>Queen Guenever understood that King Arthur was slain, and all the noble</a>
<a id='line_31513'>knights, Sir Mordred and all the remnant, then the queen stole away,</a>
<a id='line_31514'>and five ladies with her, and so she went to Almesbury; and there she</a>
<a id='line_31515'>let make herself a nun, and ware white clothes and black, and great</a>
<a id='line_31516'>penance she took, as ever did sinful lady in this land, and never</a>
<a id='line_31517'>creature could make her merry; but lived in fasting, prayers, and</a>
<a id='line_31518'>alms-deeds, that all manner of people marvelled how virtuously she was</a>
<a id='line_31519'>changed. Now leave we Queen Guenever in Almesbury, a nun in white</a>
<a id='line_31520'>clothes and black, and there she was Abbess and ruler as reason would;</a>

<a id='line_31526'>CHAPTER VIII. How when Sir Lancelot heard of the death of King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_31527'>and of Sir Gawaine, and other matters, he came into England.</a>
<a id='line_31528'></a>
<a id='line_31529'></a>
<a id='line_31530'>And when he heard in his country that Sir Mordred was crowned king in</a>
<a id='line_31531'>England, and made war against King Arthur, his own father, and would</a>
<a id='line_31532'>let him to land in his own land; also it was told Sir Launcelot how</a>
<a id='line_31533'>that Sir Mordred had laid siege about the Tower of London, because the</a>
<a id='line_31534'>queen would not wed him; then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of measure,</a>
<a id='line_31535'>and said to his kinsmen: Alas, that double traitor Sir Mordred, now me</a>
<a id='line_31536'>repenteth that ever he escaped my hands, for much shame hath he done</a>
<a id='line_31537'>unto my lord Arthur; for all I feel by the doleful letter that my lord</a>
<a id='line_31538'>Sir Gawaine sent me, on whose soul Jesu have mercy that my lord Arthur</a>
<a id='line_31539'>is full hard bestead. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should live</a>
<a id='line_31540'>to hear that most noble king that made me knight thus to be overset</a>
<a id='line_31541'>with his subject in his own realm. And this doleful letter that my</a>
<a id='line_31542'>lord, Sir Gawaine, hath sent me afore his death, praying me to see his</a>
<a id='line_31543'>tomb, wit you well his doleful words shall never go from mine heart,</a>
<a id='line_31544'>for he was a full noble knight as ever was born; and in an unhappy hour</a>
<a id='line_31545'>was I born that ever I should have that unhap to slay first Sir</a>
<a id='line_31546'>Gawaine, Sir Gaheris the good knight, and mine own friend Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_31547'>that full noble knight. Alas, I may say I am unhappy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_31548'>Launcelot, that ever I should do thus unhappily, and, alas, yet might I</a>
<a id='line_31549'>never have hap to slay that traitor, Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_31550'></a>
<a id='line_31551'>Leave your complaints, said Sir Bors, and first revenge you of the</a>
<a id='line_31552'>death of Sir Gawaine; and it will be well done that ye see Sir</a>
<a id='line_31553'>Gawaine’s tomb, and secondly that ye revenge my lord Arthur, and my</a>
<a id='line_31554'>lady, Queen Guenever. I thank you, said Sir Launcelot, for ever ye will</a>
<a id='line_31555'>my worship.</a>
<a id='line_31556'></a>
<a id='line_31557'>Then they made them ready in all the haste that might be, with ships</a>
<a id='line_31558'>and galleys, with Sir Launcelot and his host to pass into England. And</a>
<a id='line_31559'>so he passed over the sea till he came to Dover, and there he landed</a>
<a id='line_31560'>with seven kings, and the number was hideous to behold. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_31561'>Launcelot spered of men of Dover where was King Arthur become. Then the</a>
<a id='line_31562'>people told him how that he was slain, and Sir Mordred and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_31563'>thousand died on a day; and how Sir Mordred gave King Arthur there the</a>
<a id='line_31564'>first battle at his landing, and there was good Sir Gawaine slain; and</a>
<a id='line_31565'>on the morn Sir Mordred fought with the king upon Barham Down, and</a>
<a id='line_31566'>there the king put Sir Mordred to the worse. Alas, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_31567'>this is the heaviest tidings that ever came to me. Now, fair sirs, said</a>
<a id='line_31568'>Sir Launcelot, shew me the tomb of Sir Gawaine. And then certain people</a>
<a id='line_31569'>of the town brought him into the castle of Dover, and shewed him the</a>
<a id='line_31570'>tomb. Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down and wept, and prayed heartily for</a>
<a id='line_31571'>his soul. And that night he made a dole, and all they that would come</a>
<a id='line_31572'>had as much flesh, fish, wine and ale, and every man and woman had</a>
<a id='line_31573'>twelve pence, come who would. Thus with his own hand dealt he this</a>
<a id='line_31574'>money, in a mourning gown; and ever he wept, and prayed them to pray</a>
<a id='line_31575'>for the soul of Sir Gawaine. And on the morn all the priests and clerks</a>
<a id='line_31576'>that might be gotten in the country were there, and sang mass of</a>
<a id='line_31577'>Requiem; and there offered first Sir Launcelot, and he offered an</a>
<a id='line_31578'>hundred pound; and then the seven kings offered forty pound apiece; and</a>
<a id='line_31579'>also there was a thousand knights, and each of them offered a pound;</a>
<a id='line_31580'>and the offering dured from morn till night, and Sir Launcelot lay two</a>
<a id='line_31581'>nights on his tomb in prayers and weeping.</a>
<a id='line_31582'></a>
<a id='line_31583'>Then on the third day Sir Launcelot called the kings, dukes, earls,</a>
<a id='line_31584'>barons, and knights, and said thus: My fair lords, I thank you all of</a>
<a id='line_31585'>your coming into this country with me, but we came too late, and that</a>
<a id='line_31586'>shall repent me while I live, but against death may no man rebel. But</a>
<a id='line_31587'>sithen it is so, said Sir Launcelot, I will myself ride and seek my</a>
<a id='line_31588'>lady, Queen Guenever, for as I hear say she hath had great pain and</a>
<a id='line_31589'>much disease; and I heard say that she is fled into the west. Therefore</a>
<a id='line_31590'>ye all shall abide me here, and but if I come again within fifteen</a>
<a id='line_31591'>days, then take your ships and your fellowship, and depart into your</a>
<a id='line_31592'>country, for I will do as I say to you.</a>
<a id='line_31593'></a>

<a id='line_31596'></a>
<a id='line_31597'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot departed to seek the Queen Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_31598'>how he found her at Almesbury.</a>
<a id='line_31599'></a>
<a id='line_31600'></a>
<a id='line_31601'>Then came Sir Bors de Ganis, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, what</a>
<a id='line_31602'>think ye for to do, now to ride in this realm? wit ye well ye shall</a>
<a id='line_31603'>find few friends. Be as be may, said Sir Launcelot, keep you still</a>
<a id='line_31604'>here, for I will forth on my journey, and no man nor child shall go</a>
<a id='line_31605'>with me. So it was no boot to strive, but he departed and rode</a>
<a id='line_31606'>westerly, and there he sought a seven or eight days; and at the last he</a>
<a id='line_31607'>came to a nunnery, and then was Queen Guenever ware of Sir Launcelot as</a>
<a id='line_31608'>he walked in the cloister. And when she saw him there she swooned</a>
<a id='line_31609'>thrice, that all the ladies and gentlewomen had work enough to hold the</a>
<a id='line_31610'>queen up. So when she might speak, she called ladies and gentlewomen to</a>
<a id='line_31611'>her, and said: Ye marvel, fair ladies, why I make this fare. Truly, she</a>
<a id='line_31612'>said, it is for the sight of yonder knight that yonder standeth;</a>
<a id='line_31613'>wherefore I pray you all call him to me.</a>
<a id='line_31614'></a>
<a id='line_31615'>When Sir Launcelot was brought to her, then she said to all the ladies:</a>
<a id='line_31616'>Through this man and me hath all this war been wrought, and the death</a>
<a id='line_31617'>of the most noblest knights of the world; for through our love that we</a>
<a id='line_31618'>have loved together is my most noble lord slain. Therefore, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31619'>Launcelot, wit thou well I am set in such a plight to get my soul-heal;</a>
<a id='line_31620'>and yet I trust through God’s grace that after my death to have a sight</a>
<a id='line_31621'>of the blessed face of Christ, and at domesday to sit on his right</a>
<a id='line_31622'>side, for as sinful as ever I was are saints in heaven. Therefore, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31623'>Launcelot, I require thee and beseech thee heartily, for all the love</a>
<a id='line_31624'>that ever was betwixt us, that thou never see me more in the visage;</a>
<a id='line_31625'>and I command thee, on God’s behalf, that thou forsake my company, and</a>
<a id='line_31626'>to thy kingdom thou turn again, and keep well thy realm from war and</a>
<a id='line_31627'>wrack; for as well as I have loved thee, mine heart will not serve me</a>
<a id='line_31628'>to see thee, for through thee and me is the flower of kings and knights</a>
<a id='line_31629'>destroyed; therefore, Sir Launcelot, go to thy realm, and there take</a>
<a id='line_31630'>thee a wife, and live with her with joy and bliss; and I pray thee</a>
<a id='line_31631'>heartily, pray for me to our Lord that I may amend my misliving. Now,</a>
<a id='line_31632'>sweet madam, said Sir Launcelot, would ye that I should now return</a>
<a id='line_31633'>again unto my country, and there to wed a lady? Nay, madam, wit you</a>
<a id='line_31634'>well that shall I never do, for I shall never be so false to you of</a>
<a id='line_31635'>that I have promised; but the same destiny that ye have taken you to, I</a>
<a id='line_31636'>will take me unto, for to please Jesu, and ever for you I cast me</a>
<a id='line_31637'>specially to pray. If thou wilt do so, said the queen, hold thy</a>
<a id='line_31638'>promise, but I may never believe but that thou wilt turn to the world</a>
<a id='line_31639'>again. Well, madam, said he, ye say as pleaseth you, yet wist you me</a>
<a id='line_31640'>never false of my promise, and God defend but I should forsake the</a>
<a id='line_31641'>world as ye have done. For in the quest of the Sangreal I had forsaken</a>
<a id='line_31642'>the vanities of the world had not your lord been. And if I had done so</a>
<a id='line_31643'>at that time, with my heart, will, and thought, I had passed all the</a>
<a id='line_31644'>knights that were in the Sangreal except Sir Galahad, my son. And</a>
<a id='line_31645'>therefore, lady, sithen ye have taken you to perfection, I must needs</a>
<a id='line_31646'>take me to perfection, of right. For I take record of God, in you I</a>
<a id='line_31647'>have had mine earthly joy; and if I had found you now so disposed, I</a>
<a id='line_31648'>had cast me to have had you into mine own realm.</a>
<a id='line_31649'></a>

<a id='line_31653'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot came to the hermitage where the Archbishop</a>
<a id='line_31654'>of Canterbury was, and how he took the habit on him.</a>
<a id='line_31655'></a>
<a id='line_31656'></a>
<a id='line_31657'>But sithen I find you thus disposed, I ensure you faithfully, I will</a>
<a id='line_31658'>ever take me to penance, and pray while my life lasteth, if I may find</a>
<a id='line_31659'>any hermit, either gray or white, that will receive me. Wherefore,</a>
<a id='line_31660'>madam, I pray you kiss me and never no more. Nay, said the queen, that</a>
<a id='line_31661'>shall I never do, but abstain you from such works: and they departed.</a>
<a id='line_31662'>But there was never so hard an hearted man but he would have wept to</a>
<a id='line_31663'>see the dolour that they made; for there was lamentation as they had</a>
<a id='line_31664'>been stung with spears; and many times they swooned, and the ladies</a>
<a id='line_31665'>bare the queen to her chamber.</a>
<a id='line_31666'></a>
<a id='line_31667'>And Sir Launcelot awoke, and went and took his horse, and rode all that</a>
<a id='line_31668'>day and all night in a forest, weeping. And at the last he was ware of</a>
<a id='line_31669'>an hermitage and a chapel stood betwixt two cliffs; and then he heard a</a>
<a id='line_31670'>little bell ring to mass, and thither he rode and alighted, and tied</a>
<a id='line_31671'>his horse to the gate, and heard mass. And he that sang mass was the</a>
<a id='line_31672'>Bishop of Canterbury. Both the Bishop and Sir Bedivere knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_31673'>Launcelot, and they spake together after mass. But when Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_31674'>had told his tale all whole, Sir Launcelot’s heart almost brast for</a>
<a id='line_31675'>sorrow, and Sir Launcelot threw his arms abroad, and said: Alas, who</a>
<a id='line_31676'>may trust this world. And then he kneeled down on his knee, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_31677'>the Bishop to shrive him and assoil him. And then he besought the</a>
<a id='line_31678'>Bishop that he might be his brother. Then the Bishop said: I will</a>
<a id='line_31679'>gladly; and there he put an habit upon Sir Launcelot, and there he</a>
<a id='line_31680'>served God day and night with prayers and fastings.</a>
<a id='line_31681'></a>
<a id='line_31682'>Thus the great host abode at Dover. And then Sir Lionel took fifteen</a>
<a id='line_31683'>lords with him, and rode to London to seek Sir Launcelot; and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_31684'>Lionel was slain and many of his lords. Then Sir Bors de Ganis made the</a>
<a id='line_31685'>great host for to go home again; and Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31686'>Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, with more other of Sir Launcelot’s kin, took on</a>
<a id='line_31687'>them to ride all England overthwart and endlong, to seek Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_31688'>So Sir Bors by fortune rode so long till he came to the same chapel</a>
<a id='line_31689'>where Sir Launcelot was; and so Sir Bors heard a little bell knell,</a>
<a id='line_31690'>that rang to mass; and there he alighted and heard mass. And when mass</a>
<a id='line_31691'>was done, the Bishop Sir Launcelot, and Sir Bedivere, came to Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_31692'>And when Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot in that manner clothing, then he</a>
<a id='line_31693'>prayed the Bishop that he might be in the same suit. And so there was</a>
<a id='line_31694'>an habit put upon him, and there he lived in prayers and fasting. And</a>
<a id='line_31695'>within half a year, there was come Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31696'>Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Villiars, Sir Clarras, and Sir Gahalantine.</a>
<a id='line_31697'>So all these seven noble knights there abode still. And when they saw</a>
<a id='line_31698'>Sir Launcelot had taken him to such perfection, they had no lust to</a>
<a id='line_31699'>depart, but took such an habit as he had.</a>
<a id='line_31700'></a>
<a id='line_31701'>Thus they endured in great penance six year; and then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_31702'>took the habit of priesthood of the Bishop, and a twelvemonth he sang</a>
<a id='line_31703'>mass. And there was none of these other knights but they read in books,</a>
<a id='line_31704'>and holp for to sing mass, and rang bells, and did bodily all manner of</a>
<a id='line_31705'>service. And so their horses went where they would, for they took no</a>
<a id='line_31706'>regard of no worldly riches. For when they saw Sir Launcelot endure</a>
<a id='line_31707'>such penance, in prayers, and fastings, they took no force what pain</a>
<a id='line_31708'>they endured, for to see the noblest knight of the world take such</a>
<a id='line_31709'>abstinence that he waxed full lean. And thus upon a night, there came a</a>
<a id='line_31710'>vision to Sir Launcelot, and charged him, in remission of his sins, to</a>
<a id='line_31711'>haste him unto Almesbury: And by then thou come there, thou shalt find</a>
<a id='line_31712'>Queen Guenever dead. And therefore take thy fellows with thee, and</a>
<a id='line_31713'>purvey them of an horse bier, and fetch thou the corpse of her, and</a>
<a id='line_31714'>bury her by her husband, the noble King Arthur. So this avision came to</a>
<a id='line_31715'>Sir Launcelot thrice in one night.</a>
<a id='line_31716'></a>
<a id='line_31717'></a>
<a id='line_31718'></a>
<a id='line_31719'></a>
<a id='line_31720'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot went with his seven fellows to Almesbury,</a>
<a id='line_31721'>and found there Queen Guenever dead, whom they brought to Glastonbury.</a>
<a id='line_31722'></a>
<a id='line_31723'></a>
<a id='line_31724'>Then Sir Launcelot rose up or day, and told the hermit. It were well</a>
<a id='line_31725'>done, said the hermit, that ye made you ready, and that you disobey not</a>
<a id='line_31726'>the avision. Then Sir Launcelot took his eight fellows with him, and on</a>
<a id='line_31727'>foot they yede from Glastonbury to Almesbury, the which is little more</a>
<a id='line_31728'>than thirty mile. And thither they came within two days, for they were</a>
<a id='line_31729'>weak and feeble to go. And when Sir Launcelot was come to Almesbury</a>
<a id='line_31730'>within the nunnery, Queen Guenever died but half an hour afore. And the</a>
<a id='line_31731'>ladies told Sir Launcelot that Queen Guenever told them all or she</a>
<a id='line_31732'>passed, that Sir Launcelot had been priest near a twelvemonth, And</a>
<a id='line_31733'>hither he cometh as fast as he may to fetch my corpse; and beside my</a>
<a id='line_31734'>lord, King Arthur, he shall bury me. Wherefore the queen said in</a>
<a id='line_31735'>hearing of them all: I beseech Almighty God that I may never have power</a>
<a id='line_31736'>to see Sir Launcelot with my worldly eyen; and thus, said all the</a>
<a id='line_31737'>ladies, was ever her prayer these two days, till she was dead. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_31738'>Launcelot saw her visage, but he wept not greatly, but sighed. And so</a>
<a id='line_31739'>he did all the observance of the service himself, both the dirige, and</a>
<a id='line_31740'>on the morn he sang mass. And there was ordained an horse bier; and so</a>
<a id='line_31741'>with an hundred torches ever brenning about the corpse of the queen,</a>
<a id='line_31742'>and ever Sir Launcelot with his eight fellows went about the horse</a>
<a id='line_31743'>bier, singing and reading many an holy orison, and frankincense upon</a>
<a id='line_31744'>the corpse incensed. Thus Sir Launcelot and his eight fellows went on</a>
<a id='line_31745'>foot from Almesbury unto Glastonbury.</a>
<a id='line_31746'></a>
<a id='line_31747'>And when they were come to the chapel and the hermitage, there she had</a>
<a id='line_31748'>a dirige, with great devotion. And on the morn the hermit that sometime</a>
<a id='line_31749'>was Bishop of Canterbury sang the mass of Requiem with great devotion.</a>
<a id='line_31750'>And Sir Launcelot was the first that offered, and then also his eight</a>
<a id='line_31751'>fellows. And then she was wrapped in cered cloth of Raines, from the</a>
<a id='line_31752'>top to the toe, in thirtyfold, and after she was put in a web of lead,</a>
<a id='line_31753'>and then in a coffin of marble. And when she was put in the earth Sir</a>
<a id='line_31754'>Launcelot swooned, and lay long still, while the hermit came and awaked</a>
<a id='line_31755'>him, and said: Ye be to blame, for ye displease God with such manner of</a>
<a id='line_31756'>sorrow-making. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I trust I do not displease</a>
<a id='line_31757'>God, for He knoweth mine intent. For my sorrow was not, nor is not for</a>
<a id='line_31758'>any rejoicing of sin, but my sorrow may never have end. For when I</a>
<a id='line_31759'>remember of her beauty, and of her noblesse, that was both with her</a>
<a id='line_31760'>king and with her, so when I saw his corpse and her corpse so lie</a>
<a id='line_31761'>together, truly mine heart would not serve to sustain my careful body.</a>
<a id='line_31762'>Also when I remember me how by my default, mine orgule and my pride,</a>
<a id='line_31763'>that they were both laid full low, that were peerless that ever was</a>
<a id='line_31764'>living of Christian people, wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, this</a>
<a id='line_31765'>remembered, of their kindness and mine unkindness, sank so to mine</a>
<a id='line_31766'>heart, that I might not sustain myself. So the French book maketh</a>
<a id='line_31767'>mention.</a>

<a id='line_31773'>body was borne to Joyous Gard for to be buried.</a>
<a id='line_31774'></a>
<a id='line_31775'></a>
<a id='line_31776'>Then Sir Launcelot never after ate but little meat, ne drank, till he</a>
<a id='line_31777'>was dead. For then he sickened more and more, and dried, and dwined</a>
<a id='line_31778'>away. For the Bishop nor none of his fellows might not make him to eat,</a>
<a id='line_31779'>and little he drank, that he was waxen by a cubit shorter than he was,</a>
<a id='line_31780'>that the people could not know him. For evermore, day and night, he</a>
<a id='line_31781'>prayed, but sometime he slumbered a broken sleep; ever he was lying</a>
<a id='line_31782'>grovelling on the tomb of King Arthur and Queen Guenever. And there was</a>
<a id='line_31783'>no comfort that the Bishop, nor Sir Bors, nor none of his fellows,</a>
<a id='line_31784'>could make him, it availed not. So within six weeks after, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31785'>Launcelot fell sick, and lay in his bed; and then he sent for the</a>
<a id='line_31786'>Bishop that there was hermit, and all his true fellows. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_31787'>Launcelot said with dreary steven: Sir Bishop, I pray you give to me</a>
<a id='line_31788'>all my rites that longeth to a Christian man. It shall not need you,</a>
<a id='line_31789'>said the hermit and all his fellows, it is but heaviness of your blood,</a>
<a id='line_31790'>ye shall be well mended by the grace of God to-morn. My fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_31791'>said Sir Launcelot, wit you well my careful body will into the earth, I</a>
<a id='line_31792'>have warning more than now I will say; therefore give me my rites. So</a>
<a id='line_31793'>when he was houseled and anealed, and had all that a Christian man</a>
<a id='line_31794'>ought to have, he prayed the Bishop that his fellows might bear his</a>
<a id='line_31795'>body to Joyous Gard. Some men say it was Alnwick, and some men say it</a>
<a id='line_31796'>was Bamborough. Howbeit, said Sir Launcelot, me repenteth sore, but I</a>
<a id='line_31797'>made mine avow sometime, that in Joyous Gard I would be buried. And</a>
<a id='line_31798'>because of breaking of mine avow, I pray you all, lead me thither. Then</a>
<a id='line_31799'>there was weeping and wringing of hands among his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_31800'></a>
<a id='line_31801'>So at a season of the night they all went to their beds, for they all</a>
<a id='line_31802'>lay in one chamber. And so after midnight, against day, the Bishop</a>
<a id='line_31803'>[that] then was hermit, as he lay in his bed asleep, he fell upon a</a>
<a id='line_31804'>great laughter. And therewith all the fellowship awoke, and came to the</a>
<a id='line_31805'>Bishop, and asked him what he ailed. Ah Jesu mercy, said the Bishop,</a>
<a id='line_31806'>why did ye awake me? I was never in all my life so merry and so well at</a>
<a id='line_31807'>ease. Wherefore? said Sir Bors. Truly said the Bishop, here was Sir</a>
<a id='line_31808'>Launcelot with me with mo angels than ever I saw men in one day. And I</a>
<a id='line_31809'>saw the angels heave up Sir Launcelot unto heaven, and the gates of</a>
<a id='line_31810'>heaven opened against him. It is but dretching of swevens, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_31811'>Bors, for I doubt not Sir Launcelot aileth nothing but good. It may</a>
<a id='line_31812'>well be, said the Bishop; go ye to his bed, and then shall ye prove the</a>
<a id='line_31813'>sooth. So when Sir Bors and his fellows came to his bed they found him</a>
<a id='line_31814'>stark dead, and he lay as he had smiled, and the sweetest savour about</a>
<a id='line_31815'>him that ever they felt.</a>
<a id='line_31816'></a>
<a id='line_31817'>Then was there weeping and wringing of hands, and the greatest dole</a>
<a id='line_31818'>they made that ever made men. And on the morn the Bishop did his mass</a>
<a id='line_31819'>of Requiem, and after, the Bishop and all the nine knights put Sir</a>
<a id='line_31820'>Launcelot in the same horse bier that Queen Guenever was laid in</a>
<a id='line_31821'>to-fore that she was buried. And so the Bishop and they all together</a>
<a id='line_31822'>went with the body of Sir Launcelot daily, till they came to Joyous</a>
<a id='line_31823'>Gard; and ever they had an hundred torches brenning about him. And so</a>
<a id='line_31824'>within fifteen days they came to Joyous Gard. And there they laid his</a>
<a id='line_31825'>corpse in the body of the quire, and sang and read many psalters and</a>
<a id='line_31826'>prayers over him and about him.</a>
<a id='line_31827'></a>
<a id='line_31828'>And ever his visage was laid open and naked, that all folks might</a>
<a id='line_31829'>behold him. For such was the custom in those days, that all men of</a>
<a id='line_31830'>worship should so lie with open visage till that they were buried. And</a>
<a id='line_31831'>right thus as they were at their service, there came Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_31832'>Maris, that had seven years sought all England, Scotland, and Wales,</a>
<a id='line_31833'>seeking his brother, Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_31834'></a>
<a id='line_31835'></a>
<a id='line_31836'></a>
<a id='line_31837'></a>
<a id='line_31838'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Ector found Sir Launcelot his brother dead, and</a>
<a id='line_31839'>how Constantine reigned next after Arthur; and of the end of this book.</a>
<a id='line_31840'></a>
<a id='line_31841'></a>
<a id='line_31842'>And when Sir Ector heard such noise and light in the quire of Joyous</a>
<a id='line_31843'>Gard, he alighted and put his horse from him, and came into the quire,</a>
<a id='line_31844'>and there he saw men sing and weep. And all they knew Sir Ector, but he</a>
<a id='line_31845'>knew not them. Then went Sir Bors unto Sir Ector, and told him how</a>
<a id='line_31846'>there lay his brother, Sir Launcelot, dead; and then Sir Ector threw</a>
<a id='line_31847'>his shield, sword, and helm from him. And when he beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_31848'>Launcelot’s visage, he fell down in a swoon. And when he waked it were</a>
<a id='line_31849'>hard any tongue to tell the doleful complaints that he made for his</a>
<a id='line_31850'>brother. Ah Launcelot, he said, thou were head of all Christian</a>
<a id='line_31851'>knights, and now I dare say, said Sir Ector, thou Sir Launcelot, there</a>
<a id='line_31852'>thou liest, that thou were never matched of earthly knight’s hand. And</a>
<a id='line_31853'>thou were the courteoust knight that ever bare shield. And thou were</a>
<a id='line_31854'>the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrad horse. And thou were</a>
<a id='line_31855'>the truest lover of a sinful man that ever loved woman. And thou were</a>
<a id='line_31856'>the kindest man that ever struck with sword. And thou were the</a>
<a id='line_31857'>goodliest person that ever came among press of knights. And thou was</a>
<a id='line_31858'>the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among ladies.</a>
<a id='line_31859'>And thou were the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever put spear</a>
<a id='line_31860'>in the rest. Then there was weeping and dolour out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_31861'></a>
<a id='line_31862'>Thus they kept Sir Launcelot’s corpse aloft fifteen days, and then they</a>
<a id='line_31863'>buried it with great devotion. And then at leisure they went all with</a>
<a id='line_31864'>the Bishop of Canterbury to his hermitage, and there they were together</a>
<a id='line_31865'>more than a month. Then Sir Constantine, that was Sir Cador’s son of</a>
<a id='line_31866'>Cornwall, was chosen king of England. And he was a full noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_31867'>and worshipfully he ruled this realm. And then this King Constantine</a>
<a id='line_31868'>sent for the Bishop of Canterbury, for he heard say where he was. And</a>
<a id='line_31869'>so he was restored unto his Bishopric, and left that hermitage. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_31870'>Bedivere was there ever still hermit to his life’s end. Then Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_31871'>de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Gahalantine, Sir Galihud, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31872'>Galihodin, Sir Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Villiars le Valiant, Sir</a>
<a id='line_31873'>Clarrus of Clermont, all these knights drew them to their countries.</a>
<a id='line_31874'>Howbeit King Constantine would have had them with him, but they would</a>
<a id='line_31875'>not abide in this realm. And there they all lived in their countries as</a>
<a id='line_31876'>holy men. And some English books make mention that they went never out</a>
<a id='line_31877'>of England after the death of Sir Launcelot, but that was but favour of</a>
<a id='line_31878'>makers. For the French book maketh mention, and is authorised, that Sir</a>
<a id='line_31879'>Bors, Sir Ector, Sir Blamore, and Sir Bleoberis, went into the Holy</a>
<a id='line_31880'>Land thereas Jesu Christ was quick and dead, and anon as they had</a>
<a id='line_31881'>stablished their lands. For the book saith, so Sir Launcelot commanded</a>
<a id='line_31882'>them for to do, or ever he passed out of this world. And these four</a>
<a id='line_31883'>knights did many battles upon the miscreants or Turks. And there they</a>
<a id='line_31884'>died upon a Good Friday for God’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_31885'></a>
<a id='line_31886'>_Here is the end of the book of King Arthur, and of his noble knights</a>
<a id='line_31887'>of the Round Table, that when they were whole together there was ever</a>
<a id='line_31888'>an hundred and forty. And here is the end of the death of Arthur. I</a>
<a id='line_31889'>pray you all, gentlemen and gentlewomen that readeth this book of</a>
<a id='line_31890'>Arthur and his knights, from the beginning to the ending, pray for me</a>
<a id='line_31891'>while I am alive, that God send me good deliverance, and when I am</a>
<a id='line_31892'>dead, I pray you all pray for my soul. For this book was ended the</a>
<a id='line_31893'>ninth year of the reign of King Edward the Fourth, by Sir Thomas</a>
<a id='line_31894'>Maleore, knight, as Jesu help him for his great might, as he is the</a>
<a id='line_31895'>servant of Jesu both day and night._</a>
<a id='line_31896'></a>
<a id='line_31897'>_Thus endeth this noble and joyous book entitled Le Morte Darthur.</a>
<a id='line_31898'>Notwithstanding it treateth of the birth, life, and acts of the said</a>
<a id='line_31899'>King Arthur, of his noble knights of the Round Table, their marvellous</a>
<a id='line_31900'>enquests and adventures, the achieving of the Sangreal, and in the end</a>
<a id='line_31901'>the dolorous death and departing out of this world of them all. Which</a>
<a id='line_31902'>book was reduced into English by Sir Thomas Malory, knight, as afore is</a>
<a id='line_31903'>said, and by me divided into twenty-one books, chaptered and emprinted,</a>
<a id='line_31904'>and finished in the abbey, Westminster, the last day of July the year</a>
<a id='line_31905'>of our Lord MCCCCLXXXV._</a>
