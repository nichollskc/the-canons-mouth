<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>  VALENTINE. Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</a>
<a id='line_29'>    Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</a>
<a id='line_30'>    Were't not affection chains thy tender days</a>
<a id='line_31'>    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,</a>
<a id='line_32'>    I rather would entreat thy company</a>
<a id='line_33'>    To see the wonders of the world abroad,</a>
<a id='line_34'>    Than, living dully sluggardiz'd at home,</a>
<a id='line_35'>    Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</a>
<a id='line_36'>    But since thou lov'st, love still, and thrive therein,</a>
<a id='line_37'>    Even as I would, when I to love begin.</a>
<a id='line_38'>  PROTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!</a>
<a id='line_39'>    Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest</a>
<a id='line_40'>    Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.</a>
<a id='line_41'>    Wish me partaker in thy happiness</a>
<a id='line_42'>    When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,</a>
<a id='line_43'>    If ever danger do environ thee,</a>
<a id='line_44'>    Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</a>
<a id='line_45'>    For I will be thy headsman, Valentine.</a>
<a id='line_46'>  VALENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?</a>
<a id='line_47'>  PROTEUS. Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</a>
<a id='line_48'>  VALENTINE. That's on some shallow story of deep love:</a>
<a id='line_49'>    How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</a>
<a id='line_50'>  PROTEUS. That's a deep story of a deeper love;</a>
<a id='line_51'>    For he was more than over shoes in love.</a>
<a id='line_52'>  VALENTINE. 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</a>
<a id='line_53'>    And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</a>
<a id='line_54'>  PROTEUS. Over the boots! Nay, give me not the boots.</a>
<a id='line_55'>  VALENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</a>
<a id='line_56'>  PROTEUS. What?</a>
<a id='line_57'>  VALENTINE. To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans,</a>
<a id='line_58'>    Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment's mirth</a>
<a id='line_59'>    With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights;</a>
<a id='line_60'>    If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;</a>
<a id='line_61'>    If lost, why then a grievous labour won;</a>
<a id='line_62'>    However, but a folly bought with wit,</a>
<a id='line_63'>    Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</a>
<a id='line_64'>  PROTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</a>
<a id='line_65'>  VALENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.</a>
<a id='line_66'>  PROTEUS. 'Tis love you cavil at; I am not Love.</a>
<a id='line_67'>  VALENTINE. Love is your master, for he masters you;</a>
<a id='line_68'>    And he that is so yoked by a fool,</a>
<a id='line_69'>    Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</a>
<a id='line_70'>  PROTEUS. Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud</a>
<a id='line_71'>    The eating canker dwells, so eating love</a>
<a id='line_72'>    Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</a>
<a id='line_73'>  VALENTINE. And writers say, as the most forward bud</a>
<a id='line_74'>    Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</a>
<a id='line_75'>    Even so by love the young and tender wit</a>
<a id='line_76'>    Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,</a>
<a id='line_77'>    Losing his verdure even in the prime,</a>
<a id='line_78'>    And all the fair effects of future hopes.</a>
<a id='line_79'>    But wherefore waste I time to counsel the</a>
<a id='line_80'>    That art a votary to fond desire?</a>
<a id='line_81'>    Once more adieu. My father at the road</a>
<a id='line_82'>    Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.</a>
<a id='line_83'>  PROTEUS. And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</a>
<a id='line_84'>  VALENTINE. Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.</a>
<a id='line_85'>    To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Of thy success in love, and what news else</a>
<a id='line_87'>    Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</a>
<a id='line_88'>    And I likewise will visit thee with mine.</a>
<a id='line_89'>  PROTEUS. All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</a>
<a id='line_90'>  VALENTINE. As much to you at home; and so farewell!</a>
<a id='line_91'>                                                  Exit VALENTINE</a>
<a id='line_92'>  PROTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love;</a>
<a id='line_93'>    He leaves his friends to dignify them more:</a>
<a id='line_94'>    I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.</a>
<a id='line_95'>    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis'd me,</a>
<a id='line_96'>    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</a>
<a id='line_97'>    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;</a>
<a id='line_98'>    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>                         Enter SPEED</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>  SPEED. Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?</a>
<a id='line_103'>  PROTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.</a>
<a id='line_104'>  SPEED. Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,</a>
<a id='line_105'>    And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.</a>
<a id='line_106'>  PROTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,</a>
<a id='line_107'>    An if the shepherd be awhile away.</a>
<a id='line_108'>  SPEED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and</a>
<a id='line_109'>    I a sheep?</a>
<a id='line_110'>  PROTEUS. I do.</a>
<a id='line_111'>  SPEED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</a>
<a id='line_112'>  PROTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.</a>
<a id='line_113'>  SPEED. This proves me still a sheep.</a>
<a id='line_114'>  PROTEUS. True; and thy master a shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_115'>  SPEED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</a>
<a id='line_116'>  PROTEUS. It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.</a>
<a id='line_117'>  SPEED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the</a>
<a id='line_118'>    shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me;</a>
<a id='line_119'>    therefore, I am no sheep.</a>
<a id='line_120'>  PROTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for</a>
<a id='line_121'>    food follows not the sheep: thou for wages followest thy master;</a>
<a id='line_122'>    thy master for wages follows not thee. Therefore, thou art a</a>
<a id='line_123'>    sheep.</a>
<a id='line_124'>  SPEED. Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'</a>
<a id='line_125'>  PROTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav'st thou my letter to Julia?</a>
<a id='line_126'>  SPEED. Ay, sir; I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a lac'd</a>
<a id='line_127'>    mutton; and she, a lac'd mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing</a>
<a id='line_128'>    for my labour.</a>
<a id='line_129'>  PROTEUS. Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.</a>
<a id='line_130'>  SPEED. If the ground be overcharg'd, you were best stick her.</a>
<a id='line_131'>  PROTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray: 'twere best pound you.</a>
<a id='line_132'>  SPEED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your</a>
<a id='line_133'>    letter.</a>
<a id='line_134'>  PROTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound- a pinfold.</a>
<a id='line_135'>  SPEED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,</a>
<a id='line_136'>    'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.</a>
<a id='line_137'>  PROTEUS. But what said she?</a>
<a id='line_138'>  SPEED.  [Nodding]  Ay.</a>
<a id='line_139'>  PROTEUS. Nod- ay. Why, that's 'noddy.'</a>
<a id='line_140'>  SPEED. You mistook, sir; I say she did nod; and you ask me if she</a>
<a id='line_141'>    did nod; and I say 'Ay.'</a>
<a id='line_142'>  PROTEUS. And that set together is 'noddy.'</a>
<a id='line_143'>  SPEED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for</a>
<a id='line_144'>    your pains.</a>
<a id='line_145'>  PROTEUS. No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.</a>
<a id='line_146'>  SPEED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.</a>
<a id='line_147'>  PROTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?</a>
<a id='line_148'>  SPEED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the</a>
<a id='line_149'>    word 'noddy' for my pains.</a>
<a id='line_150'>  PROTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</a>
<a id='line_151'>  SPEED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</a>
<a id='line_152'>  PROTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?</a>
<a id='line_153'>  SPEED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both</a>
<a id='line_154'>    at once delivered.</a>
<a id='line_155'>  PROTEUS. Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?</a>
<a id='line_156'>  SPEED. Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.</a>
<a id='line_157'>  PROTEUS. Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?</a>
<a id='line_158'>  SPEED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so</a>
<a id='line_159'>    much as a ducat for delivering your letter; and being so hard to</a>
<a id='line_160'>    me that brought your mind, I fear she'll prove as hard to you in</a>
<a id='line_161'>    telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as</a>
<a id='line_162'>    hard as steel.</a>
<a id='line_163'>  PROTEUS. What said she? Nothing?</a>
<a id='line_164'>  SPEED. No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify</a>
<a id='line_165'>    your bounty, I thank you, you have testern'd me; in requital</a>
<a id='line_166'>    whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself; and so, sir,</a>
<a id='line_167'>    I'll commend you to my master.</a>
<a id='line_168'>  PROTEUS. Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Which cannot perish, having thee aboard,</a>
<a id='line_170'>    Being destin'd to a drier death on shore.         Exit SPEED</a>
<a id='line_171'>    I must go send some better messenger.</a>
<a id='line_172'>    I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,</a>
<a id='line_173'>    Receiving them from such a worthless post.              Exit</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>SCENE II. Verona. The garden Of JULIA'S house</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>Enter JULIA and LUCETTA</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>  JULIA. But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,</a>
<a id='line_180'>    Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</a>
<a id='line_181'>  LUCETTA. Ay, madam; so you stumble not unheedfully.</a>
<a id='line_182'>  JULIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen</a>
<a id='line_183'>    That every day with parle encounter me,</a>
<a id='line_184'>    In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</a>
<a id='line_185'>  LUCETTA. Please you, repeat their names; I'll show my mind</a>
<a id='line_186'>    According to my shallow simple skill.</a>
<a id='line_187'>  JULIA. What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</a>
<a id='line_188'>  LUCETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;</a>
<a id='line_189'>    But, were I you, he never should be mine.</a>
<a id='line_190'>  JULIA. What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?</a>
<a id='line_191'>  LUCETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.</a>
<a id='line_192'>  JULIA. What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?</a>
<a id='line_193'>  LUCETTA. Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!</a>
<a id='line_194'>  JULIA. How now! what means this passion at his name?</a>
<a id='line_195'>  LUCETTA. Pardon, dear madam; 'tis a passing shame</a>
<a id='line_196'>    That I, unworthy body as I am,</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_198'>  JULIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</a>
<a id='line_199'>  LUCETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.</a>
<a id='line_200'>  JULIA. Your reason?</a>
<a id='line_201'>  LUCETTA. I have no other but a woman's reason:</a>
<a id='line_202'>    I think him so, because I think him so.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  JULIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</a>
<a id='line_204'>  LUCETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.</a>
<a id='line_205'>  JULIA. Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov'd me.</a>
<a id='line_206'>  LUCETTA. Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.</a>
<a id='line_207'>  JULIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.</a>
<a id='line_208'>  LUCETTA. Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  JULIA. They do not love that do not show their love.</a>
<a id='line_210'>  LUCETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.</a>
<a id='line_211'>  JULIA. I would I knew his mind.</a>
<a id='line_212'>  LUCETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.</a>
<a id='line_213'>  JULIA. 'To Julia'- Say, from whom?</a>
<a id='line_214'>  LUCETTA. That the contents will show.</a>
<a id='line_215'>  JULIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?</a>
<a id='line_216'>  LUCETTA. Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.</a>
<a id='line_217'>    He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,</a>
<a id='line_218'>    Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.</a>
<a id='line_219'>  JULIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!</a>
<a id='line_220'>    Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?</a>
<a id='line_221'>    To whisper and conspire against my youth?</a>
<a id='line_222'>    Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth,</a>
<a id='line_223'>    And you an officer fit for the place.</a>
<a id='line_224'>    There, take the paper; see it be return'd;</a>
<a id='line_225'>    Or else return no more into my sight.</a>
<a id='line_226'>  LUCETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.</a>
<a id='line_227'>  JULIA. Will ye be gone?</a>
<a id='line_228'>  LUCETTA. That you may ruminate.                           Exit</a>
<a id='line_229'>  JULIA. And yet, I would I had o'erlook'd the letter.</a>
<a id='line_230'>    It were a shame to call her back again,</a>
<a id='line_231'>    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.</a>
<a id='line_232'>    What fool is she, that knows I am a maid</a>
<a id='line_233'>    And would not force the letter to my view!</a>
<a id='line_234'>    Since maids, in modesty, say 'No' to that</a>
<a id='line_235'>    Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.'</a>
<a id='line_236'>    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,</a>
<a id='line_237'>    That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse,</a>
<a id='line_238'>    And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!</a>
<a id='line_239'>    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,</a>
<a id='line_240'>    When willingly I would have had her here!</a>
<a id='line_241'>    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,</a>
<a id='line_242'>    When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile!</a>
<a id='line_243'>    My penance is to call Lucetta back</a>
<a id='line_244'>    And ask remission for my folly past.</a>
<a id='line_245'>    What ho! Lucetta!</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>                     Re-enter LUCETTA</a>

<a id='line_249'>  LUCETTA. What would your ladyship?</a>
<a id='line_250'>  JULIA. Is't near dinner time?</a>
<a id='line_251'>  LUCETTA. I would it were,</a>
<a id='line_252'>    That you might kill your stomach on your meat</a>
<a id='line_253'>    And not upon your maid.</a>
<a id='line_254'>  JULIA. What is't that you took up so gingerly?</a>
<a id='line_255'>  LUCETTA. Nothing.</a>
<a id='line_256'>  JULIA. Why didst thou stoop then?</a>
<a id='line_257'>  LUCETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.</a>
<a id='line_258'>  JULIA. And is that paper nothing?</a>
<a id='line_259'>  LUCETTA. Nothing concerning me.</a>
<a id='line_260'>  JULIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.</a>
<a id='line_261'>  LUCETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,</a>
<a id='line_262'>    Unless it have a false interpreter.</a>
<a id='line_263'>  JULIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.</a>
<a id='line_264'>  LUCETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.</a>
<a id='line_265'>    Give me a note; your ladyship can set.</a>
<a id='line_266'>  JULIA. As little by such toys as may be possible.</a>
<a id='line_267'>    Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' Love.'</a>
<a id='line_268'>  LUCETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.</a>
<a id='line_269'>  JULIA. Heavy! belike it hath some burden then.</a>
<a id='line_270'>  LUCETTA. Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.</a>
<a id='line_271'>  JULIA. And why not you?</a>
<a id='line_272'>  LUCETTA. I cannot reach so high.</a>
<a id='line_273'>  JULIA. Let's see your song.     [LUCETTA withholds the letter]</a>
<a id='line_274'>    How now, minion!</a>
<a id='line_275'>  LUCETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.</a>
<a id='line_276'>    And yet methinks I do not like this tune.</a>
<a id='line_277'>  JULIA. You do not!</a>
<a id='line_278'>  LUCETTA. No, madam; 'tis too sharp.</a>
<a id='line_279'>  JULIA. You, minion, are too saucy.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  LUCETTA. Nay, now you are too flat</a>
<a id='line_281'>    And mar the concord with too harsh a descant;</a>
<a id='line_282'>    There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.</a>
<a id='line_283'>  JULIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.</a>
<a id='line_284'>  LUCETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.</a>
<a id='line_285'>  JULIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.</a>
<a id='line_286'>    Here is a coil with protestation!         [Tears the letter]</a>
<a id='line_287'>    Go, get you gone; and let the papers lie.</a>
<a id='line_288'>    You would be fing'ring them, to anger me.</a>
<a id='line_289'>  LUCETTA. She makes it strange; but she would be best pleas'd</a>
<a id='line_290'>    To be so ang'red with another letter.                   Exit</a>
<a id='line_291'>  JULIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!</a>

<a id='line_457'>    Sir Proteus, to wreath your arms like a malcontent; to relish a</a>

<a id='line_461'>    to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears</a>

<a id='line_463'>    wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walk'd, to</a>
<a id='line_464'>    walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently</a>

<a id='line_493'>    of her beauty.</a>
<a id='line_494'>  VALENTINE. How esteem'st thou me? I account of her beauty.</a>

<a id='line_506'>  SPEED. Your own present folly and her passing deformity; for he,</a>

<a id='line_508'>    in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</a>

<a id='line_511'>  SPEED. True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you</a>

<a id='line_931'>  LAUNCE. Marry, after they clos'd in earnest, they parted very</a>

<a id='line_934'>  LAUNCE. No.</a>

<a id='line_1026'>    Who art the table wherein all my thoughts</a>

<a id='line_1047'>  JULIA. The more thou dam'st it up, the more it burns.</a>
<a id='line_1048'>    The current that with gentle murmur glides,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;</a>
<a id='line_1050'>    But when his fair course is not hindered,</a>

<a id='line_1056'>    Then let me go, and hinder not my course.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>    I'll be as patient as a gentle stream,</a>

<a id='line_1077'>  JULIA. Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favour'd.</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  LUCETTA. A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>    Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  JULIA. Lucetta, as thou lov'st me, let me have</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    What thou think'st meet, and is most mannerly.</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</a>
<a id='line_1083'>    For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</a>
<a id='line_1084'>    I fear me it will make me scandaliz'd.</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  LUCETTA. If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  JULIA. Nay, that I will not.</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  LUCETTA. Then never dream on infamy, but go.</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    If Proteus like your journey when you come,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    No matter who's displeas'd when you are gone.</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    I fear me he will scarce be pleas'd withal.</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  JULIA. That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:</a>
<a id='line_1092'>    A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    And instances of infinite of love,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  LUCETTA. All these are servants to deceitful men.</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  JULIA. Base men that use them to so base effect!</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth;</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</a>
<a id='line_1099'>    His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</a>
<a id='line_1100'>    His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  LUCETTA. Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him.</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  JULIA. Now, as thou lov'st me, do him not that wrong</a>

<a id='line_1171'></a>
<a id='line_1172'>  DUKE. Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</a>
<a id='line_1173'>  VALENTINE. Please it your Grace, there is a messenger</a>
<a id='line_1174'>    That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</a>
<a id='line_1175'>    And I am going to deliver them.</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  DUKE. Be they of much import?</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  VALENTINE. The tenour of them doth but signify</a>
<a id='line_1178'>    My health and happy being at your court.</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  DUKE. Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;</a>
<a id='line_1180'>    I am to break with thee of some affairs</a>
<a id='line_1181'>    That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</a>
<a id='line_1182'>    'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</a>
<a id='line_1183'>    To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</a>
<a id='line_1184'>  VALENTINE. I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match</a>
<a id='line_1185'>    Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman</a>
<a id='line_1186'>    Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities</a>
<a id='line_1187'>    Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.</a>
<a id='line_1188'>    Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?</a>
<a id='line_1189'>  DUKE. No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>    Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty;</a>
<a id='line_1191'>    Neither regarding that she is my child</a>
<a id='line_1192'>    Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</a>
<a id='line_1193'>    And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</a>
<a id='line_1194'>    Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;</a>
<a id='line_1195'>    And, where I thought the remnant of mine age</a>
<a id='line_1196'>    Should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty,</a>
<a id='line_1197'>    I now am full resolv'd to take a wife</a>
<a id='line_1198'>    And turn her out to who will take her in.</a>
<a id='line_1199'>    Then let her beauty be her wedding-dow'r;</a>
<a id='line_1200'>    For me and my possessions she esteems not.</a>
<a id='line_1201'>  VALENTINE. What would your Grace have me to do in this?</a>
<a id='line_1202'>  DUKE. There is a lady, in Verona here,</a>
<a id='line_1203'>    Whom I affect; but she is nice, and coy,</a>
<a id='line_1204'>    And nought esteems my aged eloquence.</a>
<a id='line_1205'>    Now, therefore, would I have thee to my tutor-</a>
<a id='line_1206'>    For long agone I have forgot to court;</a>
<a id='line_1207'>    Besides, the fashion of the time is chang'd-</a>
<a id='line_1208'>    How and which way I may bestow myself</a>
<a id='line_1209'>    To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</a>
<a id='line_1210'>  VALENTINE. Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</a>
<a id='line_1211'>    Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</a>
<a id='line_1212'>    More than quick words do move a woman's mind.</a>
<a id='line_1213'>  DUKE. But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</a>
<a id='line_1214'>  VALENTINE. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</a>
<a id='line_1215'>    Send her another; never give her o'er,</a>
<a id='line_1216'>    For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</a>
<a id='line_1217'>    If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,</a>
<a id='line_1218'>    But rather to beget more love in you;</a>
<a id='line_1219'>    If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,</a>
<a id='line_1220'>    For why, the fools are mad if left alone.</a>
<a id='line_1221'>    Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;</a>
<a id='line_1222'>    For 'Get you gone' she doth not mean 'Away!'</a>
<a id='line_1223'>    Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</a>
<a id='line_1224'>    Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.</a>
<a id='line_1225'>    That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,</a>
<a id='line_1226'>    If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</a>
<a id='line_1227'>  DUKE. But she I mean is promis'd by her friends</a>
<a id='line_1228'>    Unto a youthful gentleman of worth;</a>
<a id='line_1229'>    And kept severely from resort of men,</a>
<a id='line_1230'>    That no man hath access by day to her.</a>
<a id='line_1231'>  VALENTINE. Why then I would resort to her by night.</a>
<a id='line_1232'>  DUKE. Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>    That no man hath recourse to her by night.</a>
<a id='line_1234'>  VALENTINE. What lets but one may enter at her window?</a>
<a id='line_1235'>  DUKE. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1236'>    And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</a>
<a id='line_1237'>    Without apparent hazard of his life.</a>
<a id='line_1238'>  VALENTINE. Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,</a>
<a id='line_1239'>    To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks,</a>
<a id='line_1240'>    Would serve to scale another Hero's tow'r,</a>
<a id='line_1241'>    So bold Leander would adventure it.</a>
<a id='line_1242'>  DUKE. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>    Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</a>
<a id='line_1244'>  VALENTINE. When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.</a>
<a id='line_1245'>  DUKE. This very night; for Love is like a child,</a>
<a id='line_1246'>    That longs for everything that he can come by.</a>
<a id='line_1247'>  VALENTINE. By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.</a>
<a id='line_1248'>  DUKE. But, hark thee; I will go to her alone;</a>
<a id='line_1249'>    How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</a>
<a id='line_1250'>  VALENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</a>
<a id='line_1251'>    Under a cloak that is of any length.</a>
<a id='line_1252'>  DUKE. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</a>
<a id='line_1253'>  VALENTINE. Ay, my good lord.</a>
<a id='line_1254'>  DUKE. Then let me see thy cloak.</a>
<a id='line_1255'>    I'll get me one of such another length.</a>
<a id='line_1256'>  VALENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1257'>  DUKE. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</a>
<a id='line_1258'>    I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.</a>
<a id='line_1259'>    What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!</a>

<a id='line_1506'>  DUKE. This weak impress of love is as a figure</a>

<a id='line_1517'>  DUKE. My daughter takes his going grievously.</a>
<a id='line_1518'>  PROTEUS. A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</a>
<a id='line_1519'>  DUKE. So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.</a>
<a id='line_1520'>    Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee-</a>
<a id='line_1521'>    For thou hast shown some sign of good desert-</a>
<a id='line_1522'>    Makes me the better to confer with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1523'>  PROTEUS. Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace</a>
<a id='line_1524'>    Let me not live to look upon your Grace.</a>
<a id='line_1525'>  DUKE. Thou know'st how willingly I would effect</a>
<a id='line_1526'>    The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.</a>
<a id='line_1527'>  PROTEUS. I do, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1528'>  DUKE. And also, I think, thou art not ignorant</a>
<a id='line_1529'>    How she opposes her against my will.</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  PROTEUS. She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  DUKE. Ay, and perversely she persevers so.</a>
<a id='line_1532'>    What might we do to make the girl forget</a>
<a id='line_1533'>    The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?</a>
<a id='line_1534'>  PROTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine</a>
<a id='line_1535'>    With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent-</a>
<a id='line_1536'>    Three things that women highly hold in hate.</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  DUKE. Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.</a>
<a id='line_1538'>  PROTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it;</a>
<a id='line_1539'>    Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</a>
<a id='line_1540'>    By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  DUKE. Then you must undertake to slander him.</a>
<a id='line_1542'>  PROTEUS. And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</a>
<a id='line_1543'>    'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</a>
<a id='line_1544'>    Especially against his very friend.</a>
<a id='line_1545'>  DUKE. Where your good word cannot advantage him,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>    Your slander never can endamage him;</a>
<a id='line_1547'>    Therefore the office is indifferent,</a>
<a id='line_1548'>    Being entreated to it by your friend.</a>
<a id='line_1549'>  PROTEUS. You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it</a>

<a id='line_1552'>    But say this weed her love from Valentine,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>    It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  THURIO. Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</a>
<a id='line_1555'>    Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>    You must provide to bottom it on me;</a>
<a id='line_1557'>    Which must be done by praising me as much</a>
<a id='line_1558'>    As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</a>
<a id='line_1559'>  DUKE. And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</a>
<a id='line_1560'>    Because we know, on Valentine's report,</a>
<a id='line_1561'>    You are already Love's firm votary</a>

<a id='line_1564'>    Where you with Silvia may confer at large-</a>
<a id='line_1565'>    For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</a>

<a id='line_1567'>    Where you may temper her by your persuasion</a>
<a id='line_1568'>    To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</a>
<a id='line_1569'>  PROTEUS. As much as I can do I will effect.</a>
<a id='line_1570'>    But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</a>
<a id='line_1571'>    You must lay lime to tangle her desires</a>
<a id='line_1572'>    By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</a>
<a id='line_1573'>    Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</a>
<a id='line_1574'>  DUKE. Ay,</a>
<a id='line_1575'>    Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</a>
<a id='line_1576'>  PROTEUS. Say that upon the altar of her beauty</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;</a>
<a id='line_1578'>    Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</a>

<a id='line_1580'>    That may discover such integrity;</a>
<a id='line_1581'>    For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,</a>
<a id='line_1582'>    Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</a>
<a id='line_1583'>    Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</a>
<a id='line_1584'>    Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</a>

<a id='line_1905'>Enter LAUNCE with his dog</a>
<a id='line_1906'></a>
<a id='line_1907'>  LAUNCE. When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you,</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav'd from</a>
<a id='line_1909'>  drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went</a>
<a id='line_1910'>  to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely 'Thus I</a>
<a id='line_1911'>  would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him as a present to</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher and steals her</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  capon's leg. O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I</a>
<a id='line_1918'>  think verily he had been hang'd for't; sure as I live, he had</a>
<a id='line_1919'>  suffer'd for't. You shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table;</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  he had not been there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?'</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  says another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. 'Friend,' quoth</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I' quoth he. 'You do him</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the thing you wot of.' He makes</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  would do this for his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  stock for puddings he hath stol'n, otherwise he had been executed; I</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill'd, otherwise he had</a>
<a id='line_1932'>  suffer'd for't. Thou think'st not of this now. Nay, I remember the</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  trick you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I</a>
<a id='line_1934'>  bid thee still mark me and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? Didst</a>
<a id='line_1936'>  thou ever see me do such a trick?</a>

<a id='line_1945'>    Where have you been these two days loitering?</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  LAUNCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  PROTEUS. And what says she to my little jewel?</a>
<a id='line_1948'>  LAUNCE. Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    thanks is good enough for such a present.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  PROTEUS. But she receiv'd my dog?</a>
<a id='line_1951'>  LAUNCE. No, indeed, did she not; here have I brought him back</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    again.</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  PROTEUS. What, didst thou offer her this from me?</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  LAUNCE. Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    hangman's boys in the market-place; and then I offer'd her mine</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    the greater.</a>
<a id='line_1958'>  PROTEUS. Go, get thee hence and find my dog again,</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    Or ne'er return again into my sight.</a>
<a id='line_1960'>    Away, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here?        Exit LAUNCE</a>

<a id='line_1976'>  JULIA. Alas!</a>
<a id='line_1977'>  PROTEUS. Why dost thou cry 'Alas'?</a>
<a id='line_1978'>  JULIA. I cannot choose</a>
<a id='line_1979'>    But pity her.</a>
<a id='line_1980'>  PROTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?</a>
<a id='line_1981'>  JULIA. Because methinks that she lov'd you as well</a>
<a id='line_1982'>    As you do love your lady Silvia.</a>
<a id='line_1983'>    She dreams on him that has forgot her love:</a>

<a id='line_1985'>    'Tis pity love should be so contrary;</a>
<a id='line_1986'>    And thinking on it makes me cry 'Alas!'</a>
<a id='line_1987'>  PROTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal</a>

<a id='line_1995'>    Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him</a>
<a id='line_1996'>    That with his very heart despiseth me?</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;</a>
<a id='line_1998'>    Because I love him, I must pity him.</a>
<a id='line_1999'>    This ring I gave him, when he parted from me,</a>

<a id='line_2013'>    Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you be my mean</a>
<a id='line_2014'>    To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.</a>
<a id='line_2015'>  SILVIA. What would you with her, if that I be she?</a>
<a id='line_2016'>  JULIA. If you be she, I do entreat your patience</a>
<a id='line_2017'>    To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</a>
<a id='line_2018'>  SILVIA. From whom?</a>
<a id='line_2019'>  JULIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.</a>
<a id='line_2020'>  SILVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?</a>
<a id='line_2021'>  JULIA. Ay, madam.</a>
<a id='line_2022'>  SILVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.</a>
<a id='line_2023'>    Go, give your master this. Tell him from me,</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  JULIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.</a>
<a id='line_2027'>    Pardon me, madam; I have unadvis'd</a>
<a id='line_2028'>    Deliver'd you a paper that I should not.</a>
<a id='line_2029'>    This is the letter to your ladyship.</a>
<a id='line_2030'>  SILVIA. I pray thee let me look on that again.</a>
<a id='line_2031'>  JULIA. It may not be; good madam, pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_2032'>  SILVIA. There, hold!</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    I will not look upon your master's lines.</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    I know they are stuff'd with protestations,</a>
<a id='line_2035'>    And full of new-found oaths, which he wul break</a>
<a id='line_2036'>    As easily as I do tear his paper.</a>
<a id='line_2037'>  JULIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</a>
<a id='line_2038'>  SILVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me;</a>
<a id='line_2039'>    For I have heard him say a thousand times</a>
<a id='line_2040'>    His Julia gave it him at his departure.</a>
<a id='line_2041'>    Though his false finger have profan'd the ring,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</a>
<a id='line_2043'>  JULIA. She thanks you.</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  SILVIA. What say'st thou?</a>
<a id='line_2045'>  JULIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her.</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.</a>
<a id='line_2047'>  SILVIA. Dost thou know her?</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  JULIA. Almost as well as I do know myself.</a>
<a id='line_2049'>    To think upon her woes, I do protest</a>
<a id='line_2050'>    That I have wept a hundred several times.</a>
<a id='line_2051'>  SILVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.</a>
<a id='line_2052'>  JULIA. I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_2053'>  SILVIA. Is she not passing fair?</a>
<a id='line_2054'>  JULIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is.</a>
<a id='line_2055'>    When she did think my master lov'd her well,</a>
<a id='line_2056'>    She, in my judgment, was as fair as you;</a>
<a id='line_2057'>    But since she did neglect her looking-glass</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</a>
<a id='line_2059'>    The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>    That now she is become as black as I.</a>
<a id='line_2062'>  SILVIA. How tall was she?</a>
<a id='line_2063'>  JULIA. About my stature; for at Pentecost,</a>
<a id='line_2064'>    When all our pageants of delight were play'd,</a>
<a id='line_2065'>    Our youth got me to play the woman's part,</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown;</a>
<a id='line_2067'>    Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>    As if the garment had been made for me;</a>
<a id='line_2069'>    Therefore I know she is about my height.</a>
<a id='line_2070'>    And at that time I made her weep a good,</a>
<a id='line_2071'>    For I did play a lamentable part.</a>
<a id='line_2072'>    Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning</a>
<a id='line_2073'>    For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    Which I so lively acted with my tears</a>
<a id='line_2075'>    That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</a>
<a id='line_2076'>    Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</a>
<a id='line_2077'>    If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_2078'>  SILVIA. She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</a>
<a id='line_2079'>    Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</a>
<a id='line_2080'>    I weep myself, to think upon thy words.</a>
<a id='line_2081'>    Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this</a>
<a id='line_2082'>    For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lov'st her.</a>
<a id='line_2083'>    Farewell.                        Exit SILVIA with ATTENDANTS</a>
<a id='line_2084'>  JULIA. And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.</a>
<a id='line_2085'>    A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!</a>
<a id='line_2086'>    I hope my master's suit will be but cold,</a>
<a id='line_2087'>    Since she respects my mistress' love so much.</a>
<a id='line_2088'>    Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</a>
<a id='line_2089'>    Here is her picture; let me see. I think,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>    If I had such a tire, this face of mine</a>
<a id='line_2091'>    Were full as lovely as is this of hers;</a>
<a id='line_2092'>    And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,</a>
<a id='line_2093'>    Unless I flatter with myself too much.</a>
<a id='line_2094'>    Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow;</a>
<a id='line_2095'>    If that be all the difference in his love,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>    I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.</a>
<a id='line_2097'>    Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine;</a>
<a id='line_2098'>    Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.</a>
<a id='line_2099'>    What should it be that he respects in her</a>
<a id='line_2100'>    But I can make respective in myself,</a>
<a id='line_2101'>    If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,</a>
<a id='line_2103'>    For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</a>
<a id='line_2104'>    Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, lov'd, and ador'd!</a>
<a id='line_2105'>    And were there sense in his idolatry</a>
<a id='line_2106'>    My substance should be statue in thy stead.</a>
<a id='line_2107'>    I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,</a>
<a id='line_2108'>    That us'd me so; or else, by Jove I vow,</a>
<a id='line_2109'>    I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>    To make my master out of love with thee.                Exit</a>

<a id='line_2300'>    But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</a>
<a id='line_2301'>    The private wound is deepest. O time most accurst!</a>
<a id='line_2302'>    'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</a>
<a id='line_2303'>  PROTEUS. My shame and guilt confounds me.</a>
<a id='line_2304'>    Forgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow</a>
<a id='line_2305'>    Be a sufficient ransom for offence,</a>
<a id='line_2306'>    I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer</a>
<a id='line_2307'>    As e'er I did commit.</a>
<a id='line_2308'>  VALENTINE. Then I am paid;</a>
<a id='line_2309'>    And once again I do receive thee honest.</a>
<a id='line_2310'>    Who by repentance is not satisfied</a>
<a id='line_2311'>    Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleas'd;</a>
<a id='line_2312'>    By penitence th' Eternal's wrath's appeas'd.</a>
<a id='line_2313'>    And, that my love may appear plain and free,</a>
<a id='line_2314'>    All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.</a>
<a id='line_2315'>  JULIA. O me unhappy!                                  [Swoons]</a>
<a id='line_2316'>  PROTEUS. Look to the boy.</a>
<a id='line_2317'>  VALENTINE. Why, boy! why, wag! how now!</a>
<a id='line_2318'>    What's the matter? Look up; speak.</a>
<a id='line_2319'>  JULIA. O good sir, my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam</a>
<a id='line_2320'>    Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.</a>
<a id='line_2321'>  PROTEUS. Where is that ring, boy?</a>
<a id='line_2322'>  JULIA. Here 'tis; this is it.</a>
<a id='line_2323'>  PROTEUS. How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.</a>
<a id='line_2324'>  JULIA. O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;</a>
<a id='line_2325'>    This is the ring you sent to Silvia.</a>
<a id='line_2326'>  PROTEUS. But how cam'st thou by this ring?</a>
<a id='line_2327'>    At my depart I gave this unto Julia.</a>
<a id='line_2328'>  JULIA. And Julia herself did give it me;</a>
<a id='line_2329'>    And Julia herself have brought it hither.</a>
<a id='line_2330'>  PROTEUS. How! Julia!</a>
<a id='line_2331'>  JULIA. Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,</a>
<a id='line_2332'>    And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.</a>
<a id='line_2333'>    How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!</a>
<a id='line_2334'>    O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!</a>
<a id='line_2335'>    Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me</a>
<a id='line_2336'>    Such an immodest raiment- if shame live</a>
<a id='line_2337'>    In a disguise of love.</a>
<a id='line_2338'>    It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,</a>
<a id='line_2339'>    Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</a>
<a id='line_2340'>  PROTEUS. Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man</a>
<a id='line_2341'>    But constant, he were perfect! That one error</a>
<a id='line_2342'>    Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th' sins:</a>
<a id='line_2343'>    Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.</a>
<a id='line_2344'>    What is in Silvia's face but I may spy</a>
<a id='line_2345'>    More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?</a>
<a id='line_2346'>  VALENTINE. Come, come, a hand from either.</a>
<a id='line_2347'>    Let me be blest to make this happy close;</a>
<a id='line_2348'>    'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</a>
<a id='line_2349'>  PROTEUS. Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2350'>  JULIA. And I mine.</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>                Enter OUTLAWS, with DUKE and THURIO</a>
<a id='line_2353'></a>
<a id='line_2354'>  OUTLAW. A prize, a prize, a prize!</a>
<a id='line_2355'>  VALENTINE. Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.</a>
<a id='line_2356'>    Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd,</a>
<a id='line_2357'>    Banished Valentine.</a>
<a id='line_2358'>  DUKE. Sir Valentine!</a>
<a id='line_2359'>  THURIO. Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.</a>
<a id='line_2360'>  VALENTINE. Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;</a>
<a id='line_2361'>    Come not within the measure of my wrath;</a>
<a id='line_2362'>    Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,</a>
<a id='line_2363'>    Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands</a>
<a id='line_2364'>    Take but possession of her with a touch-</a>
<a id='line_2365'>    I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.</a>
<a id='line_2366'>  THURIO. Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;</a>
<a id='line_2367'>    I hold him but a fool that will endanger</a>
<a id='line_2368'>    His body for a girl that loves him not.</a>
<a id='line_2369'>    I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.</a>
<a id='line_2370'>  DUKE. The more degenerate and base art thou</a>
<a id='line_2371'>    To make such means for her as thou hast done</a>
<a id='line_2372'>    And leave her on such slight conditions.</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    Now, by the honour of my ancestry,</a>
<a id='line_2374'>    I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</a>
<a id='line_2375'>    And think thee worthy of an empress' love.</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    Know then, I here forget all former griefs,</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    Thou art a gentleman, and well deriv'd;</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserv'd her.</a>
<a id='line_2382'>  VALENTINE. I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.</a>
<a id='line_2385'>  DUKE. I grant it for thine own, whate'er it be.</a>
<a id='line_2386'>  VALENTINE. These banish'd men, that I have kept withal,</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    Are men endu'd with worthy qualities;</a>
<a id='line_2388'>    Forgive them what they have committed here,</a>
<a id='line_2389'>    And let them be recall'd from their exile:</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    They are reformed, civil, full of good,</a>
<a id='line_2391'>    And fit for great employment, worthy lord.</a>
<a id='line_2392'>  DUKE. Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them, and thee;</a>
<a id='line_2393'>    Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.</a>
<a id='line_2394'>    Come, let us go; we will include all jars</a>
<a id='line_2395'>    With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.</a>
<a id='line_2396'>  VALENTINE. And, as we walk along, I dare be bold</a>
<a id='line_2397'>    With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.</a>
<a id='line_2398'>    What think you of this page, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2399'>  DUKE. I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.</a>
<a id='line_2400'>  VALENTINE. I warrant you, my lord- more grace than boy.</a>
<a id='line_2401'>  DUKE. What mean you by that saying?</a>
<a id='line_2402'>  VALENTINE. Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,</a>
<a id='line_2403'>    That you will wonder what hath fortuned.</a>
<a id='line_2404'>    Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance but to hear</a>
<a id='line_2405'>    The story of your loves discovered.</a>
<a id='line_2406'>    That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;</a>
<a id='line_2407'>    One feast, one house, one mutual happiness!     Exeunt</a>
