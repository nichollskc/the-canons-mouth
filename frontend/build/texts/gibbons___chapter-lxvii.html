<a id='line_2'>     Schism Of The Greeks And Latins.—Reign And Character Of Amurath</a>

<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The respective merits of Rome and Constantinople are compared and</a>
<a id='line_8'>      celebrated by an eloquent Greek, the father of the Italian</a>
<a id='line_9'>      schools. 1 The view of the ancient capital, the seat of his</a>
<a id='line_10'>      ancestors, surpassed the most sanguine expectations of Emanuel</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Chrysoloras; and he no longer blamed the exclamation of an old</a>
<a id='line_12'>      sophist, that Rome was the habitation, not of men, but of gods.</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Those gods, and those men, had long since vanished; but to the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      eye of liberal enthusiasm, the majesty of ruin restored the image</a>
<a id='line_15'>      of her ancient prosperity. The monuments of the consuls and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      Cæsars, of the martyrs and apostles, engaged on all sides the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      curiosity of the philosopher and the Christian; and he confessed</a>
<a id='line_18'>      that in every age the arms and the religion of Rome were destined</a>
<a id='line_19'>      to reign over the earth. While Chrysoloras admired the venerable</a>
<a id='line_20'>      beauties of the mother, he was not forgetful of his native</a>
<a id='line_21'>      country, her fairest daughter, her Imperial colony; and the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      Byzantine patriot expatiates with zeal and truth on the eternal</a>
<a id='line_23'>      advantages of nature, and the more transitory glories of art and</a>
<a id='line_24'>      dominion, which adorned, or had adorned, the city of Constantine.</a>
<a id='line_25'>      Yet the perfection of the copy still redounds (as he modestly</a>
<a id='line_26'>      observes) to the honor of the original, and parents are delighted</a>
<a id='line_27'>      to be renewed, and even excelled, by the superior merit of their</a>
<a id='line_28'>      children. “Constantinople,” says the orator, “is situate on a</a>
<a id='line_29'>      commanding point, between Europe and Asia, between the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      Archipelago and the Euxine. By her interposition, the two seas,</a>
<a id='line_31'>      and the two continents, are united for the common benefit of</a>
<a id='line_32'>      nations; and the gates of commerce may be shut or opened at her</a>
<a id='line_33'>      command. The harbor, encompassed on all sides by the sea, and the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      continent, is the most secure and capacious in the world. The</a>
<a id='line_35'>      walls and gates of Constantinople may be compared with those of</a>
<a id='line_36'>      Babylon: the towers many; each tower is a solid and lofty</a>
<a id='line_37'>      structure; and the second wall, the outer fortification, would be</a>
<a id='line_38'>      sufficient for the defence and dignity of an ordinary capital. A</a>
<a id='line_39'>      broad and rapid stream may be introduced into the ditches and the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      artificial island may be encompassed, like Athens, 2 by land or</a>
<a id='line_41'>      water.” Two strong and natural causes are alleged for the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      perfection of the model of new Rome. The royal founder reigned</a>
<a id='line_43'>      over the most illustrious nations of the globe; and in the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      accomplishment of his designs, the power of the Romans was</a>
<a id='line_45'>      combined with the art and science of the Greeks. Other cities</a>
<a id='line_46'>      have been reared to maturity by accident and time: their beauties</a>
<a id='line_47'>      are mingled with disorder and deformity; and the inhabitants,</a>
<a id='line_48'>      unwilling to remove from their natal spot, are incapable of</a>
<a id='line_49'>      correcting the errors of their ancestors, and the original vices</a>
<a id='line_50'>      of situation or climate. But the free idea of Constantinople was</a>
<a id='line_51'>      formed and executed by a single mind; and the primitive model was</a>
<a id='line_52'>      improved by the obedient zeal of the subjects and successors of</a>
<a id='line_53'>      the first monarch. The adjacent isles were stored with an</a>
<a id='line_54'>      inexhaustible supply of marble; but the various materials were</a>
<a id='line_55'>      transported from the most remote shores of Europe and Asia; and</a>
<a id='line_56'>      the public and private buildings, the palaces, churches,</a>
<a id='line_57'>      aqueducts, cisterns, porticos, columns, baths, and hippodromes,</a>
<a id='line_58'>      were adapted to the greatness of the capital of the East. The</a>
<a id='line_59'>      superfluity of wealth was spread along the shores of Europe and</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Asia; and the Byzantine territory, as far as the Euxine, the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      Hellespont, and the long wall, might be considered as a populous</a>
<a id='line_62'>      suburb and a perpetual garden. In this flattering picture, the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      past and the present, the times of prosperity and decay, are</a>
<a id='line_64'>      artfully confounded; but a sigh and a confession escape, from the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      orator, that his wretched country was the shadow and sepulchre of</a>
<a id='line_66'>      its former self. The works of ancient sculpture had been defaced</a>
<a id='line_67'>      by Christian zeal or Barbaric violence; the fairest structures</a>
<a id='line_68'>      were demolished; and the marbles of Paros or Numidia were burnt</a>
<a id='line_69'>      for lime, or applied to the meanest uses. Of many a statue, the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      place was marked by an empty pedestal; of many a column, the size</a>
<a id='line_71'>      was determined by a broken capital; the tombs of the emperors</a>
<a id='line_72'>      were scattered on the ground; the stroke of time was accelerated</a>
<a id='line_73'>      by storms and earthquakes; and the vacant space was adorned, by</a>
<a id='line_74'>      vulgar tradition, with fabulous monuments of gold and silver.</a>
<a id='line_75'>      From these wonders, which lived only in memory or belief, he</a>
<a id='line_76'>      distinguishes, however, the porphyry pillar, the column and</a>
<a id='line_77'>      colossus of Justinian, 3 and the church, more especially the</a>
<a id='line_78'>      dome, of St. Sophia; the best conclusion, since it could not be</a>
<a id='line_79'>      described according to its merits, and after it no other object</a>
<a id='line_80'>      could deserve to be mentioned. But he forgets that, a century</a>
<a id='line_81'>      before, the trembling fabrics of the colossus and the church had</a>
<a id='line_82'>      been saved and supported by the timely care of Andronicus the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      Elder. Thirty years after the emperor had fortified St. Sophia</a>
<a id='line_84'>      with two new buttresses or pyramids, the eastern hemisphere</a>
<a id='line_85'>      suddenly gave way: and the images, the altars, and the sanctuary,</a>
<a id='line_86'>      were crushed by the falling ruin. The mischief indeed was</a>
<a id='line_87'>      speedily repaired; the rubbish was cleared by the incessant labor</a>
<a id='line_88'>      of every rank and age; and the poor remains of riches and</a>
<a id='line_89'>      industry were consecrated by the Greeks to the most stately and</a>
<a id='line_90'>      venerable temple of the East. 4</a>

<a id='line_123'>      and of God himself, &c.]</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>      The last hope of the falling city and empire was placed in the</a>
<a id='line_126'>      harmony of the mother and daughter, in the maternal tenderness of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      Rome, and the filial obedience of Constantinople. In the synod of</a>
<a id='line_128'>      Florence, the Greeks and Latins had embraced, and subscribed, and</a>
<a id='line_129'>      promised; but these signs of friendship were perfidious or</a>
<a id='line_130'>      fruitless; 5 and the baseless fabric of the union vanished like a</a>
<a id='line_131'>      dream. 6 The emperor and his prelates returned home in the</a>
<a id='line_132'>      Venetian galleys; but as they touched at the Morea and the Isles</a>
<a id='line_133'>      of Corfu and Lesbos, the subjects of the Latins complained that</a>
<a id='line_134'>      the pretended union would be an instrument of oppression. No</a>
<a id='line_135'>      sooner did they land on the Byzantine shore, than they were</a>
<a id='line_136'>      saluted, or rather assailed, with a general murmur of zeal and</a>
<a id='line_137'>      discontent. During their absence, above two years, the capital</a>
<a id='line_138'>      had been deprived of its civil and ecclesiastical rulers;</a>
<a id='line_139'>      fanaticism fermented in anarchy; the most furious monks reigned</a>
<a id='line_140'>      over the conscience of women and bigots; and the hatred of the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      Latin name was the first principle of nature and religion. Before</a>
<a id='line_142'>      his departure for Italy, the emperor had flattered the city with</a>
<a id='line_143'>      the assurance of a prompt relief and a powerful succor; and the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      clergy, confident in their orthodoxy and science, had promised</a>
<a id='line_145'>      themselves and their flocks an easy victory over the blind</a>
<a id='line_146'>      shepherds of the West. The double disappointment exasperated the</a>
<a id='line_147'>      Greeks; the conscience of the subscribing prelates was awakened;</a>
<a id='line_148'>      the hour of temptation was past; and they had more to dread from</a>
<a id='line_149'>      the public resentment, than they could hope from the favor of the</a>
<a id='line_150'>      emperor or the pope. Instead of justifying their conduct, they</a>
<a id='line_151'>      deplored their weakness, professed their contrition, and cast</a>
<a id='line_152'>      themselves on the mercy of God and of their brethren. To the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      reproachful question, what had been the event or the use of their</a>
<a id='line_154'>      Italian synod? they answered with sighs and tears, “Alas! we have</a>
<a id='line_155'>      made a new faith; we have exchanged piety for impiety; we have</a>
<a id='line_156'>      betrayed the immaculate sacrifice; and we are become _Azymites_.”</a>
<a id='line_157'>      (The Azymites were those who celebrated the communion with</a>
<a id='line_158'>      unleavened bread; and I must retract or qualify the praise which</a>
<a id='line_159'>      I have bestowed on the growing philosophy of the times.) “Alas!</a>
<a id='line_160'>      we have been seduced by distress, by fraud, and by the hopes and</a>
<a id='line_161'>      fears of a transitory life. The hand that has signed the union</a>
<a id='line_162'>      should be cut off; and the tongue that has pronounced the Latin</a>
<a id='line_163'>      creed deserves to be torn from the root.” The best proof of their</a>
<a id='line_164'>      repentance was an increase of zeal for the most trivial rites and</a>
<a id='line_165'>      the most incomprehensible doctrines; and an absolute separation</a>
<a id='line_166'>      from all, without excepting their prince, who preserved some</a>
<a id='line_167'>      regard for honor and consistency. After the decease of the</a>
<a id='line_168'>      patriarch Joseph, the archbishops of Heraclea and Trebizond had</a>
<a id='line_169'>      courage to refuse the vacant office; and Cardinal Bessarion</a>
<a id='line_170'>      preferred the warm and comfortable shelter of the Vatican. The</a>
<a id='line_171'>      choice of the emperor and his clergy was confined to Metrophanes</a>
<a id='line_172'>      of Cyzicus: he was consecrated in St. Sophia, but the temple was</a>
<a id='line_173'>      vacant. The cross-bearers abdicated their service; the infection</a>
<a id='line_174'>      spread from the city to the villages; and Metrophanes discharged,</a>
<a id='line_175'>      without effect, some ecclesiastical thunders against a nation of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      schismatics. The eyes of the Greeks were directed to Mark of</a>
<a id='line_177'>      Ephesus, the champion of his country; and the sufferings of the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      holy confessor were repaid with a tribute of admiration and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      applause. His example and writings propagated the flame of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      religious discord; age and infirmity soon removed him from the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      world; but the gospel of Mark was not a law of forgiveness; and</a>
<a id='line_182'>      he requested with his dying breath, that none of the adherents of</a>
<a id='line_183'>      Rome might attend his obsequies or pray for his soul.</a>

<a id='line_188'>      clergy and people.]</a>

<a id='line_196'>      passion, as soon as Rome and religion are concerned.]</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>      The schism was not confined to the narrow limits of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_199'>      empire. Secure under the Mamaluke sceptre, the three patriarchs</a>
<a id='line_200'>      of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, assembled a numerous</a>
<a id='line_201'>      synod; disowned their representatives at Ferrara and Florence;</a>
<a id='line_202'>      condemned the creed and council of the Latins; and threatened the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      emperor of Constantinople with the censures of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_204'>      church. Of the sectaries of the Greek communion, the Russians</a>
<a id='line_205'>      were the most powerful, ignorant, and superstitious. Their</a>
<a id='line_206'>      primate, the cardinal Isidore, hastened from Florence to Moscow,</a>
<a id='line_207'>      7 to reduce the independent nation under the Roman yoke. But the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      Russian bishops had been educated at Mount Athos; and the prince</a>
<a id='line_209'>      and people embraced the theology of their priests. They were</a>
<a id='line_210'>      scandalized by the title, the pomp, the Latin cross of the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      legate, the friend of those impious men who shaved their beards,</a>
<a id='line_212'>      and performed the divine office with gloves on their hands and</a>
<a id='line_213'>      rings on their fingers: Isidore was condemned by a synod; his</a>
<a id='line_214'>      person was imprisoned in a monastery; and it was with extreme</a>
<a id='line_215'>      difficulty that the cardinal could escape from the hands of a</a>
<a id='line_216'>      fierce and fanatic people. 8 The Russians refused a passage to</a>
<a id='line_217'>      the missionaries of Rome who aspired to convert the Pagans beyond</a>
<a id='line_218'>      the Tanais; 9 and their refusal was justified by the maxim, that</a>
<a id='line_219'>      the guilt of idolatry is less damnable than that of schism. The</a>
<a id='line_220'>      errors of the Bohemians were excused by their abhorrence for the</a>
<a id='line_221'>      pope; and a deputation of the Greek clergy solicited the</a>
<a id='line_222'>      friendship of those sanguinary enthusiasts. 10 While Eugenius</a>
<a id='line_223'>      triumphed in the union and orthodoxy of the Greeks, his party was</a>
<a id='line_224'>      contracted to the walls, or rather to the palace of</a>
<a id='line_225'>      Constantinople. The zeal of Palæologus had been excited by</a>
<a id='line_226'>      interest; it was soon cooled by opposition: an attempt to violate</a>
<a id='line_227'>      the national belief might endanger his life and crown; not could</a>
<a id='line_228'>      the pious rebels be destitute of foreign and domestic aid. The</a>
<a id='line_229'>      sword of his brother Demetrius, who in Italy had maintained a</a>
<a id='line_230'>      prudent and popular silence, was half unsheathed in the cause of</a>
<a id='line_231'>      religion; and Amurath, the Turkish sultan, was displeased and</a>
<a id='line_232'>      alarmed by the seeming friendship of the Greeks and Latins.</a>

<a id='line_271'>      Amurath; Belgrade alone withstood his attacks. 101 Under his</a>
<a id='line_272'>      reign, the soldier was ever victorious, the citizen rich and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      secure. If he subdued any country, his first care was to build</a>
<a id='line_274'>      mosques and caravansaras, hospitals, and colleges. Every year he</a>
<a id='line_275'>      gave a thousand pieces of gold to the sons of the Prophet; and</a>
<a id='line_276'>      sent two thousand five hundred to the religious persons of Mecca,</a>
<a id='line_277'>      Medina, and Jerusalem.” 11 This portrait is transcribed from the</a>

<a id='line_279'>      superstitious people has been lavished on the worst of tyrants;</a>
<a id='line_280'>      and the virtues of a sultan are often the vices most useful to</a>
<a id='line_281'>      himself, or most agreeable to his subjects. A nation ignorant of</a>
<a id='line_282'>      the equal benefits of liberty and law, must be awed by the</a>
<a id='line_283'>      flashes of arbitrary power: the cruelty of a despot will assume</a>
<a id='line_284'>      the character of justice; his profusion, of liberality; his</a>
<a id='line_285'>      obstinacy, of firmness. If the most reasonable excuse be</a>
<a id='line_286'>      rejected, few acts of obedience will be found impossible; and</a>
<a id='line_287'>      guilt must tremble, where innocence cannot always be secure. The</a>
<a id='line_288'>      tranquillity of the people, and the discipline of the troops,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      were best maintained by perpetual action in the field; war was</a>
<a id='line_290'>      the trade of the Janizaries; and those who survived the peril,</a>
<a id='line_291'>      and divided the spoil, applauded the generous ambition of their</a>
<a id='line_292'>      sovereign. To propagate the true religion, was the duty of a</a>
<a id='line_293'>      faithful Mussulman: the unbelievers were _his_ enemies, and those</a>
<a id='line_294'>      of the Prophet; and, in the hands of the Turks, the cimeter was</a>
<a id='line_295'>      the only instrument of conversion. Under these circumstances,</a>
<a id='line_296'>      however, the justice and moderation of Amurath are attested by</a>

<a id='line_298'>      consider a prosperous reign and a peaceful death as the reward of</a>
<a id='line_299'>      his singular merits. In the vigor of his age and military power,</a>
<a id='line_300'>      he seldom engaged in war till he was justified by a previous and</a>
<a id='line_301'>      adequate provocation: the victorious sultan was disarmed by</a>

<a id='line_500'>      narrow interval of six days’ march from the foot of the mountains</a>
<a id='line_501'>      to the hostile towers of Adrianople, and the friendly capital of</a>
<a id='line_502'>      the Greek empire. The retreat was undisturbed; and the entrance</a>
<a id='line_503'>      into Buda was at once a military and religious triumph. An</a>
<a id='line_504'>      ecclesiastical procession was followed by the king and his</a>
<a id='line_505'>      warriors on foot: he nicely balanced the merits and rewards of</a>
<a id='line_506'>      the two nations; and the pride of conquest was blended with the</a>
<a id='line_507'>      humble temper of Christianity. Thirteen bashaws, nine standards,</a>
<a id='line_508'>      and four thousand captives, were unquestionable trophies; and as</a>
<a id='line_509'>      all were willing to believe, and none were present to contradict,</a>
<a id='line_510'>      the crusaders multiplied, with unblushing confidence, the myriads</a>

<a id='line_519'>      swore on the Gospel and the Koran, attested the word of God as</a>
<a id='line_520'>      the guardian of truth and the avenger of perfidy. In the place of</a>
<a id='line_521'>      the Gospel, the Turkish ministers had proposed to substitute the</a>

<a id='line_556'>      This mischievous casuistry was seconded by his respectable</a>
<a id='line_557'>      character, and the levity of popular assemblies: war was</a>
<a id='line_558'>      resolved, on the same spot where peace had so lately been sworn;</a>
<a id='line_559'>      and, in the execution of the treaty, the Turks were assaulted by</a>
<a id='line_560'>      the Christians; to whom, with some reason, they might apply the</a>
<a id='line_561'>      epithet of Infidels. The falsehood of Ladislaus to his word and</a>
<a id='line_562'>      oath was palliated by the religion of the times: the most</a>
<a id='line_563'>      perfect, or at least the most popular, excuse would have been the</a>
<a id='line_564'>      success of his arms and the deliverance of the Eastern church.</a>
<a id='line_565'>      But the same treaty which should have bound his conscience had</a>
<a id='line_566'>      diminished his strength. On the proclamation of the peace, the</a>
<a id='line_567'>      French and German volunteers departed with indignant murmurs: the</a>
<a id='line_568'>      Poles were exhausted by distant warfare, and perhaps disgusted</a>
<a id='line_569'>      with foreign command; and their palatines accepted the first</a>
<a id='line_570'>      license, and hastily retired to their provinces and castles. Even</a>
<a id='line_571'>      Hungary was divided by faction, or restrained by a laudable</a>
<a id='line_572'>      scruple; and the relics of the crusade that marched in the second</a>
<a id='line_573'>      expedition were reduced to an inadequate force of twenty thousand</a>
<a id='line_574'>      men. A Walachian chief, who joined the royal standard with his</a>
<a id='line_575'>      vassals, presumed to remark that their numbers did not exceed the</a>
<a id='line_576'>      hunting retinue that sometimes attended the sultan; and the gift</a>
<a id='line_577'>      of two horses of matchless speed might admonish Ladislaus of his</a>
<a id='line_578'>      secret foresight of the event. But the despot of Servia, after</a>
<a id='line_579'>      the restoration of his country and children, was tempted by the</a>
<a id='line_580'>      promise of new realms; and the inexperience of the king, the</a>

<a id='line_624'>      Europe. According to some writers, the Greek emperor had been</a>

<a id='line_630'>      when the cardinal, and Huniades, had taken a nearer survey of the</a>
<a id='line_631'>      numbers and order of the Turks, these ardent warriors proposed</a>
<a id='line_632'>      the tardy and impracticable measure of a retreat. The king alone</a>
<a id='line_633'>      was resolved to conquer or die; and his resolution had almost</a>
<a id='line_634'>      been crowned with a glorious and salutary victory. The princes</a>
<a id='line_635'>      were opposite to each other in the centre; and the Beglerbegs, or</a>
<a id='line_636'>      generals of Anatolia and Romania, commanded on the right and</a>
<a id='line_637'>      left, against the adverse divisions of the despot and Huniades.</a>
<a id='line_638'>      The Turkish wings were broken on the first onset: but the</a>
<a id='line_639'>      advantage was fatal; and the rash victors, in the heat of the</a>
<a id='line_640'>      pursuit, were carried away far from the annoyance of the enemy,</a>
<a id='line_641'>      or the support of their friends. When Amurath beheld the flight</a>
<a id='line_642'>      of his squadrons, he despaired of his fortune and that of the</a>
<a id='line_643'>      empire: a veteran Janizary seized his horse’s bridle; and he had</a>
<a id='line_644'>      magnanimity to pardon and reward the soldier who dared to</a>
<a id='line_645'>      perceive the terror, and arrest the flight, of his sovereign. A</a>
<a id='line_646'>      copy of the treaty, the monument of Christian perfidy, had been</a>
<a id='line_647'>      displayed in the front of battle; and it is said, that the sultan</a>
<a id='line_648'>      in his distress, lifting his eyes and his hands to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_649'>      implored the protection of the God of truth; and called on the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      prophet Jesus himself to avenge the impious mockery of his name</a>
<a id='line_651'>      and religion. 26 With inferior numbers and disordered ranks, the</a>
<a id='line_652'>      king of Hungary rushed forward in the confidence of victory, till</a>
<a id='line_653'>      his career was stopped by the impenetrable phalanx of the</a>
<a id='line_654'>      Janizaries. If we may credit the Ottoman annals, his horse was</a>
<a id='line_655'>      pierced by the javelin of Amurath; 27 he fell among the spears of</a>
<a id='line_656'>      the infantry; and a Turkish soldier proclaimed with a loud voice,</a>
<a id='line_657'>      “Hungarians, behold the head of your king!” The death of</a>
<a id='line_658'>      Ladislaus was the signal of their defeat. On his return from an</a>
<a id='line_659'>      intemperate pursuit, Huniades deplored his error, and the public</a>
<a id='line_660'>      loss; he strove to rescue the royal body, till he was overwhelmed</a>
<a id='line_661'>      by the tumultuous crowd of the victors and vanquished; and the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      last efforts of his courage and conduct were exerted to save the</a>

<a id='line_668'>      similar victory. 271 At his command a column was erected on the</a>

<a id='line_703'>      on the character and story of two principal actors, the cardinal</a>
<a id='line_704'>      Julian and John Huniades. Julian 29 Cæsarini was born of a noble</a>
<a id='line_705'>      family of Rome: his studies had embraced both the Latin and Greek</a>
<a id='line_706'>      learning, both the sciences of divinity and law; and his</a>
<a id='line_707'>      versatile genius was equally adapted to the schools, the camp,</a>
<a id='line_708'>      and the court. No sooner had he been invested with the Roman</a>
<a id='line_709'>      purple, than he was sent into Germany to arm the empire against</a>
<a id='line_710'>      the rebels and heretics of Bohemia. The spirit of persecution is</a>
<a id='line_711'>      unworthy of a Christian; the military profession ill becomes a</a>
<a id='line_712'>      priest; but the former is excused by the times; and the latter</a>
<a id='line_713'>      was ennobled by the courage of Julian, who stood dauntless and</a>
<a id='line_714'>      alone in the disgraceful flight of the German host. As the pope’s</a>
<a id='line_715'>      legate, he opened the council of Basil; but the president soon</a>
<a id='line_716'>      appeared the most strenuous champion of ecclesiastical freedom;</a>
<a id='line_717'>      and an opposition of seven years was conducted by his ability and</a>
<a id='line_718'>      zeal. After promoting the strongest measures against the</a>
<a id='line_719'>      authority and person of Eugenius, some secret motive of interest</a>
<a id='line_720'>      or conscience engaged him to desert on a sudden the popular</a>
<a id='line_721'>      party. The cardinal withdrew himself from Basil to Ferrara; and,</a>
<a id='line_722'>      in the debates of the Greeks and Latins, the two nations admired</a>
<a id='line_723'>      the dexterity of his arguments and the depth of his theological</a>
<a id='line_724'>      erudition. 30 In his Hungarian embassy, we have already seen the</a>

<a id='line_746'>      might possibly ascend to the emperors of Constantinople; and the</a>
<a id='line_747'>      claims of the Walachians, with the surname of Corvinus, from the</a>
<a id='line_748'>      place of his nativity, might suggest a thin pretence for mingling</a>
<a id='line_749'>      his blood with the patricians of ancient Rome. 31 In his youth he</a>
<a id='line_750'>      served in the wars of Italy, and was retained, with twelve</a>
<a id='line_751'>      horsemen, by the bishop of Zagrab: the valor of the _white</a>
<a id='line_752'>      knight_ 32 was soon conspicuous; he increased his fortunes by a</a>
<a id='line_753'>      noble and wealthy marriage; and in the defence of the Hungarian</a>
<a id='line_754'>      borders he won in the same year three battles against the Turks.</a>
<a id='line_755'>      By his influence, Ladislaus of Poland obtained the crown of</a>
<a id='line_756'>      Hungary; and the important service was rewarded by the title and</a>
<a id='line_757'>      office of Waivod of Transylvania. The first of Julian’s crusades</a>
<a id='line_758'>      added two Turkish laurels on his brow; and in the public distress</a>
<a id='line_759'>      the fatal errors of Warna were forgotten. During the absence and</a>
<a id='line_760'>      minority of Ladislaus of Austria, the titular king, Huniades was</a>
<a id='line_761'>      elected supreme captain and governor of Hungary; and if envy at</a>
<a id='line_762'>      first was silenced by terror, a reign of twelve years supposes</a>
<a id='line_763'>      the arts of policy as well as of war. Yet the idea of a</a>
<a id='line_764'>      consummate general is not delineated in his campaigns; the white</a>
<a id='line_765'>      knight fought with the hand rather than the head, as the chief of</a>
<a id='line_766'>      desultory Barbarians, who attack without fear and fly without</a>
<a id='line_767'>      shame; and his military life is composed of a romantic</a>
<a id='line_768'>      alternative of victories and escapes. By the Turks, who employed</a>
<a id='line_769'>      his name to frighten their perverse children, he was corruptly</a>
<a id='line_770'>      denominated _Jancus Lain_, or the Wicked: their hatred is the</a>
<a id='line_771'>      proof of their esteem; the kingdom which he guarded was</a>
<a id='line_772'>      inaccessible to their arms; and they felt him most daring and</a>
<a id='line_773'>      formidable, when they fondly believed the captain and his country</a>
<a id='line_774'>      irrecoverably lost. Instead of confining himself to a defensive</a>
<a id='line_775'>      war, four years after the defeat of Warna he again penetrated</a>
<a id='line_776'>      into the heart of Bulgaria, and in the plain of Cossova,</a>
<a id='line_777'>      sustained, till the third day, the shock of the Ottoman army,</a>
<a id='line_778'>      four times more numerous than his own. As he fled alone through</a>
<a id='line_779'>      the woods of Walachia, the hero was surprised by two robbers; but</a>
<a id='line_780'>      while they disputed a gold chain that hung at his neck, he</a>
<a id='line_781'>      recovered his sword, slew the one, terrified the other, and,</a>
<a id='line_782'>      after new perils of captivity or death, consoled by his presence</a>
<a id='line_783'>      an afflicted kingdom. But the last and most glorious action of</a>
<a id='line_784'>      his life was the defence of Belgrade against the powers of</a>
<a id='line_785'>      Mahomet the Second in person. After a siege of forty days, the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      Turks, who had already entered the town, were compelled to</a>
<a id='line_787'>      retreat; and the joyful nations celebrated Huniades and Belgrade</a>
<a id='line_788'>      as the bulwarks of Christendom. 33 About a month after this great</a>
<a id='line_789'>      deliverance, the champion expired; and his most splendid epitaph</a>
<a id='line_790'>      is the regret of the Ottoman prince, who sighed that he could no</a>
<a id='line_791'>      longer hope for revenge against the single antagonist who had</a>
<a id='line_792'>      triumphed over his arms. On the first vacancy of the throne,</a>
<a id='line_793'>      Matthias Corvinus, a youth of eighteen years of age, was elected</a>
<a id='line_794'>      and crowned by the grateful Hungarians. His reign was prosperous</a>
<a id='line_795'>      and long: Matthias aspired to the glory of a conqueror and a</a>
<a id='line_796'>      saint: but his purest merit is the encouragement of learning; and</a>
<a id='line_797'>      the Latin orators and historians, who were invited from Italy by</a>
<a id='line_798'>      the son, have shed the lustre of their eloquence on the father’s</a>

<a id='line_831'>      In the list of heroes, John Huniades and Scanderbeg are commonly</a>
<a id='line_832'>      associated; 35 and they are both entitled to our notice, since</a>
<a id='line_833'>      their occupation of the Ottoman arms delayed the ruin of the</a>
<a id='line_834'>      Greek empire. John Castriot, the father of Scanderbeg, 36 was the</a>
<a id='line_835'>      hereditary prince of a small district of Epirus or Albania,</a>
<a id='line_836'>      between the mountains and the Adriatic Sea. Unable to contend</a>
<a id='line_837'>      with the sultan’s power, Castriot submitted to the hard</a>
<a id='line_838'>      conditions of peace and tribute: he delivered his four sons as</a>
<a id='line_839'>      the pledges of his fidelity; and the Christian youths, after</a>
<a id='line_840'>      receiving the mark of circumcision, were instructed in the</a>
<a id='line_841'>      Mahometan religion, and trained in the arms and arts of Turkish</a>
<a id='line_842'>      policy. 37 The three elder brothers were confounded in the crowd</a>
<a id='line_843'>      of slaves; and the poison to which their deaths are ascribed</a>
<a id='line_844'>      cannot be verified or disproved by any positive evidence. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_845'>      suspicion is in a great measure removed by the kind and paternal</a>
<a id='line_846'>      treatment of George Castriot, the fourth brother, who, from his</a>
<a id='line_847'>      tender youth, displayed the strength and spirit of a soldier. The</a>
<a id='line_848'>      successive overthrow of a Tartar and two Persians, who carried a</a>
<a id='line_849'>      proud defiance to the Turkish court, recommended him to the favor</a>
<a id='line_850'>      of Amurath, and his Turkish appellation of Scanderbeg, (_Iskender</a>
<a id='line_851'>      beg_,) or the lord Alexander, is an indelible memorial of his</a>
<a id='line_852'>      glory and servitude. His father’s principality was reduced into a</a>
<a id='line_853'>      province; but the loss was compensated by the rank and title of</a>
<a id='line_854'>      Sanjiak, a command of five thousand horse, and the prospect of</a>
<a id='line_855'>      the first dignities of the empire. He served with honor in the</a>
<a id='line_856'>      wars of Europe and Asia; and we may smile at the art or credulity</a>
<a id='line_857'>      of the historian, who supposes, that in every encounter he spared</a>
<a id='line_858'>      the Christians, while he fell with a thundering arm on his</a>
<a id='line_859'>      Mussulman foes. The glory of Huniades is without reproach: he</a>
<a id='line_860'>      fought in the defence of his religion and country; but the</a>
<a id='line_861'>      enemies who applaud the patriot, have branded his rival with the</a>
<a id='line_862'>      name of traitor and apostate. In the eyes of the Christian, the</a>
<a id='line_863'>      rebellion of Scanderbeg is justified by his father’s wrongs, the</a>
<a id='line_864'>      ambiguous death of his three brothers, his own degradation, and</a>
<a id='line_865'>      the slavery of his country; and they adore the generous, though</a>
<a id='line_866'>      tardy, zeal, with which he asserted the faith and independence of</a>
<a id='line_867'>      his ancestors. But he had imbibed from his ninth year the</a>
<a id='line_868'>      doctrines of the Koran; he was ignorant of the Gospel; the</a>
<a id='line_869'>      religion of a soldier is determined by authority and habit; nor</a>
<a id='line_870'>      is it easy to conceive what new illumination at the age of forty</a>
<a id='line_871'>      38 could be poured into his soul. His motives would be less</a>
<a id='line_872'>      exposed to the suspicion of interest or revenge, had he broken</a>
<a id='line_873'>      his chain from the moment that he was sensible of its weight: but</a>
<a id='line_874'>      a long oblivion had surely impaired his original right; and every</a>
<a id='line_875'>      year of obedience and reward had cemented the mutual bond of the</a>
<a id='line_876'>      sultan and his subject. If Scanderbeg had long harbored the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      belief of Christianity and the intention of revolt, a worthy mind</a>
<a id='line_878'>      must condemn the base dissimulation, that could serve only to</a>
<a id='line_879'>      betray, that could promise only to be forsworn, that could</a>
<a id='line_880'>      actively join in the temporal and spiritual perdition of so many</a>
<a id='line_881'>      thousands of his unhappy brethren. Shall we praise a secret</a>
<a id='line_882'>      correspondence with Huniades, while he commanded the vanguard of</a>
<a id='line_883'>      the Turkish army? shall we excuse the desertion of his standard,</a>
<a id='line_884'>      a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to the</a>
<a id='line_885'>      enemies of his benefactor? In the confusion of a defeat, the eye</a>
<a id='line_886'>      of Scanderbeg was fixed on the Reis Effendi or principal</a>
<a id='line_887'>      secretary: with the dagger at his breast, he extorted a firman or</a>
<a id='line_888'>      patent for the government of Albania; and the murder of the</a>
<a id='line_889'>      guiltless scribe and his train prevented the consequences of an</a>
<a id='line_890'>      immediate discovery. With some bold companions, to whom he had</a>
<a id='line_891'>      revealed his design he escaped in the night, by rapid marches,</a>
<a id='line_892'>      from the field or battle to his paternal mountains. The gates of</a>
<a id='line_893'>      Croya were opened to the royal mandate; and no sooner did he</a>
<a id='line_894'>      command the fortress, than George Castriot dropped the mask of</a>
<a id='line_895'>      dissimulation; abjured the prophet and the sultan, and proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_896'>      himself the avenger of his family and country. The names of</a>
<a id='line_897'>      religion and liberty provoked a general revolt: the Albanians, a</a>
<a id='line_898'>      martial race, were unanimous to live and die with their</a>
<a id='line_899'>      hereditary prince; and the Ottoman garrisons were indulged in the</a>
<a id='line_900'>      choice of martyrdom or baptism. In the assembly of the states of</a>
<a id='line_901'>      Epirus, Scanderbeg was elected general of the Turkish war; and</a>
<a id='line_902'>      each of the allies engaged to furnish his respective proportion</a>
<a id='line_903'>      of men and money. From these contributions, from his patrimonial</a>
<a id='line_904'>      estate, and from the valuable salt-pits of Selina, he drew an</a>
<a id='line_905'>      annual revenue of two hundred thousand ducats; 39 and the entire</a>
<a id='line_906'>      sum, exempt from the demands of luxury, was strictly appropriated</a>
<a id='line_907'>      to the public use. His manners were popular; but his discipline</a>
<a id='line_908'>      was severe; and every superfluous vice was banished from his</a>
<a id='line_909'>      camp: his example strengthened his command; and under his</a>
<a id='line_910'>      conduct, the Albanians were invincible in their own opinion and</a>
<a id='line_911'>      that of their enemies. The bravest adventurers of France and</a>
<a id='line_912'>      Germany were allured by his fame and retained in his service: his</a>
<a id='line_913'>      standing militia consisted of eight thousand horse and seven</a>
<a id='line_914'>      thousand foot; the horses were small, the men were active; but he</a>
<a id='line_915'>      viewed with a discerning eye the difficulties and resources of</a>
<a id='line_916'>      the mountains; and, at the blaze of the beacons, the whole nation</a>
<a id='line_917'>      was distributed in the strongest posts. With such unequal arms</a>
<a id='line_918'>      Scanderbeg resisted twenty-three years the powers of the Ottoman</a>
<a id='line_919'>      empire; and two conquerors, Amurath the Second, and his greater</a>
<a id='line_920'>      son, were repeatedly baffled by a rebel, whom they pursued with</a>
<a id='line_921'>      seeming contempt and implacable resentment. At the head of sixty</a>
<a id='line_922'>      thousand horse and forty thousand Janizaries, Amurath entered</a>
<a id='line_923'>      Albania: he might ravage the open country, occupy the defenceless</a>
<a id='line_924'>      towns, convert the churches into mosques, circumcise the</a>
<a id='line_925'>      Christian youths, and punish with death his adult and obstinate</a>
<a id='line_926'>      captives: but the conquests of the sultan were confined to the</a>
<a id='line_927'>      petty fortress of Sfetigrade; and the garrison, invincible to his</a>
<a id='line_928'>      arms, was oppressed by a paltry artifice and a superstitious</a>
<a id='line_929'>      scruple. 40 Amurath retired with shame and loss from the walls of</a>
<a id='line_930'>      Croya, the castle and residence of the Castriots; the march, the</a>
<a id='line_931'>      siege, the retreat, were harassed by a vexatious, and almost</a>
<a id='line_932'>      invisible, adversary; 41 and the disappointment might tend to</a>
<a id='line_933'>      imbitter, perhaps to shorten, the last days of the sultan. 42 In</a>
<a id='line_934'>      the fulness of conquest, Mahomet the Second still felt at his</a>
<a id='line_935'>      bosom this domestic thorn: his lieutenants were permitted to</a>
<a id='line_936'>      negotiate a truce; and the Albanian prince may justly be praised</a>
<a id='line_937'>      as a firm and able champion of his national independence. The</a>
<a id='line_938'>      enthusiasm of chivalry and religion has ranked him with the names</a>
<a id='line_939'>      of Alexander and Pyrrhus; nor would they blush to acknowledge</a>
<a id='line_940'>      their intrepid countryman: but his narrow dominion, and slender</a>
<a id='line_941'>      powers, must leave him at an humble distance below the heroes of</a>
<a id='line_942'>      antiquity, who triumphed over the East and the Roman legions. His</a>
<a id='line_943'>      splendid achievements, the bashaws whom he encountered, the</a>
<a id='line_944'>      armies that he discomfited, and the three thousand Turks who were</a>
<a id='line_945'>      slain by his single hand, must be weighed in the scales of</a>
<a id='line_946'>      suspicious criticism. Against an illiterate enemy, and in the</a>
<a id='line_947'>      dark solitude of Epirus, his partial biographers may safely</a>
<a id='line_948'>      indulge the latitude of romance: but their fictions are exposed</a>
<a id='line_949'>      by the light of Italian history; and they afford a strong</a>
<a id='line_950'>      presumption against their own truth, by a fabulous tale of his</a>
<a id='line_951'>      exploits, when he passed the Adriatic with eight hundred horse to</a>
<a id='line_952'>      the succor of the king of Naples. 43 Without disparagement to his</a>
<a id='line_953'>      fame, they might have owned, that he was finally oppressed by the</a>
<a id='line_954'>      Ottoman powers: in his extreme danger he applied to Pope Pius the</a>
<a id='line_955'>      Second for a refuge in the ecclesiastical state; and his</a>
<a id='line_956'>      resources were almost exhausted, since Scanderbeg died a fugitive</a>
<a id='line_957'>      at Lissus, on the Venetian territory. 44 His sepulchre was soon</a>
<a id='line_958'>      violated by the Turkish conquerors; but the Janizaries, who wore</a>
<a id='line_959'>      his bones enchased in a bracelet, declared by this superstitious</a>
<a id='line_960'>      amulet their involuntary reverence for his valor. The instant</a>
<a id='line_961'>      ruin of his country may redound to the hero’s glory; yet, had he</a>
<a id='line_962'>      balanced the consequences of submission and resistance, a patriot</a>
<a id='line_963'>      perhaps would have declined the unequal contest which must depend</a>
<a id='line_964'>      on the life and genius of one man. Scanderbeg might indeed be</a>
<a id='line_965'>      supported by the rational, though fallacious, hope, that the</a>
<a id='line_966'>      pope, the king of Naples, and the Venetian republic, would join</a>
<a id='line_967'>      in the defence of a free and Christian people, who guarded the</a>
<a id='line_968'>      sea-coast of the Adriatic, and the narrow passage from Greece to</a>
<a id='line_969'>      Italy. His infant son was saved from the national shipwreck; the</a>
<a id='line_970'>      Castriots 45 were invested with a Neapolitan dukedom, and their</a>
<a id='line_971'>      blood continues to flow in the noblest families of the realm. A</a>

<a id='line_1053'>      reduced to three princes, Constantine, Demetrius, and Thomas, the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      surviving sons of the emperor Manuel. Of these the first and the</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      last were far distant in the Morea; but Demetrius, who possessed</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      the domain of Selybria, was in the suburbs, at the head of a</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      party: his ambition was not chilled by the public distress; and</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      his conspiracy with the Turks and the schismatics had already</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      disturbed the peace of his country. The funeral of the late</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      emperor was accelerated with singular and even suspicious haste:</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      the claim of Demetrius to the vacant throne was justified by a</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      trite and flimsy sophism, that he was born in the purple, the</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      eldest son of his father’s reign. But the empress-mother, the</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      senate and soldiers, the clergy and people, were unanimous in the</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      cause of the lawful successor: and the despot Thomas, who,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      ignorant of the change, accidentally returned to the capital,</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      asserted with becoming zeal the interest of his absent brother.</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      An ambassador, the historian Phranza, was immediately despatched</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      to the court of Adrianople. Amurath received him with honor and</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      dismissed him with gifts; but the gracious approbation of the</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      Turkish sultan announced his supremacy, and the approaching</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      downfall of the Eastern empire. By the hands of two illustrious</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      deputies, the Imperial crown was placed at Sparta on the head of</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      Constantine. In the spring he sailed from the Morea, escaped the</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      encounter of a Turkish squadron, enjoyed the acclamations of his</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      subjects, celebrated the festival of a new reign, and exhausted</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      by his donatives the treasure, or rather the indigence, of the</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      state. The emperor immediately resigned to his brothers the</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      possession of the Morea; and the brittle friendship of the two</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      princes, Demetrius and Thomas, was confirmed in their mother’s</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      presence by the frail security of oaths and embraces. His next</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      occupation was the choice of a consort. A daughter of the doge of</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      Venice had been proposed; but the Byzantine nobles objected the</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      distance between an hereditary monarch and an elective</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      magistrate; and in their subsequent distress, the chief of that</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      powerful republic was not unmindful of the affront. Constantine</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      afterwards hesitated between the royal families of Trebizond and</a>

<a id='line_1100'>      The _protovestiare_, or great chamberlain, Phranza sailed from</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      Constantinople as the minister of a bridegroom; and the relics of</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      wealth and luxury were applied to his pompous appearance. His</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      numerous retinue consisted of nobles and guards, of physicians</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      and monks: he was attended by a band of music; and the term of</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      his costly embassy was protracted above two years. On his arrival</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      in Georgia or Iberia, the natives from the towns and villages</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      flocked around the strangers; and such was their simplicity, that</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      they were delighted with the effects, without understanding the</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      cause, of musical harmony. Among the crowd was an old man, above</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      a hundred years of age, who had formerly been carried away a</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      captive by the Barbarians, 49 and who amused his hearers with a</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      tale of the wonders of India, 50 from whence he had returned to</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      Portugal by an unknown sea. 51 From this hospitable land, Phranza</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      proceeded to the court of Trebizond, where he was informed by the</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      Greek prince of the recent decease of Amurath. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      rejoicing in the deliverance, the experienced statesman expressed</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      his apprehension, that an ambitious youth would not long adhere</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      to the sage and pacific system of his father. After the sultan’s</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      decease, his Christian wife, Maria, 52 the daughter of the</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      Servian despot, had been honorably restored to her parents; on</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      the fame of her beauty and merit, she was recommended by the</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      ambassador as the most worthy object of the royal choice; and</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      Phranza recapitulates and refutes the specious objections that</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      might be raised against the proposal. The majesty of the purple</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      would ennoble an unequal alliance; the bar of affinity might be</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      removed by liberal alms and the dispensation of the church; the</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      disgrace of Turkish nuptials had been repeatedly overlooked; and,</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      though the fair Maria was nearly fifty years of age, she might</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      yet hope to give an heir to the empire. Constantine listened to</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      the advice, which was transmitted in the first ship that sailed</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      from Trebizond; but the factions of the court opposed his</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      marriage; and it was finally prevented by the pious vow of the</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      sultana, who ended her days in the monastic profession. Reduced</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      to the first alternative, the choice of Phranza was decided in</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      favor of a Georgian princess; and the vanity of her father was</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      dazzled by the glorious alliance. Instead of demanding, according</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      to the primitive and national custom, a price for his daughter,</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      53 he offered a portion of fifty-six thousand, with an annual</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      pension of five thousand, ducats; and the services of the</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      ambassador were repaid by an assurance, that, as his son had been</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      adopted in baptism by the emperor, the establishment of his</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      daughter should be the peculiar care of the empress of</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      Constantinople. On the return of Phranza, the treaty was ratified</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      by the Greek monarch, who with his own hand impressed three</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      vermilion crosses on the golden bull, and assured the Georgian</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      envoy that in the spring his galleys should conduct the bride to</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      her Imperial palace. But Constantine embraced his faithful</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      servant, not with the cold approbation of a sovereign, but with</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      the warm confidence of a friend, who, after a long absence, is</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      impatient to pour his secrets into the bosom of his friend.</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      “Since the death of my mother and of Cantacuzene, who alone</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      advised me without interest or passion, 54 I am surrounded,” said</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      the emperor, “by men whom I can neither love nor trust, nor</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      esteem. You are not a stranger to Lucas Notaras, the great</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      admiral; obstinately attached to his own sentiments, he declares,</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      both in private and public, that his sentiments are the absolute</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      measure of my thoughts and actions. The rest of the courtiers are</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      swayed by their personal or factious views; and how can I consult</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      the monks on questions of policy and marriage? I have yet much</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      employment for your diligence and fidelity. In the spring you</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      shall engage one of my brothers to solicit the succor of the</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      Western powers; from the Morea you shall sail to Cyprus on a</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      particular commission; and from thence proceed to Georgia to</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      receive and conduct the future empress.”—“Your commands,” replied</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      Phranza, “are irresistible; but deign, great sir,” he added, with</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      a serious smile, “to consider, that if I am thus perpetually</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      absent from my family, my wife may be tempted either to seek</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      another husband, or to throw herself into a monastery.” After</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      laughing at his apprehensions, the emperor more gravely consoled</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      him by the pleasing assurance that _this_ should be his last</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      service abroad, and that he destined for his son a wealthy and</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      noble heiress; for himself, the important office of great</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      logothete, or principal minister of state. The marriage was</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      immediately stipulated: but the office, however incompatible with</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      his own, had been usurped by the ambition of the admiral. Some</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      delay was requisite to negotiate a consent and an equivalent; and</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      the nomination of Phranza was half declared, and half suppressed,</a>
