<a id='line_74'> black.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_77'>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>BERTRAM.</a>
<a id='line_80'>And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must</a>
<a id='line_81'>attend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in</a>
<a id='line_82'>subjection.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_85'>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He</a>
<a id='line_86'>that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his</a>
<a id='line_87'>virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted,</a>
<a id='line_88'>rather than lack it where there is such abundance.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_91'>What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_94'>He hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath</a>
<a id='line_95'>persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process</a>
<a id='line_96'>but only the losing of hope by time.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_99'>This young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage</a>
<a id='line_100'>’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d</a>
<a id='line_101'>so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for</a>
<a id='line_102'>lack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it</a>
<a id='line_103'>would be the death of the king’s disease.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_106'>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_109'>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be</a>
<a id='line_110'>so: Gerard de Narbon.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_113'>He was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him</a>
<a id='line_114'>admiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still,</a>
<a id='line_115'>if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>BERTRAM.</a>
<a id='line_118'>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_121'>A fistula, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>BERTRAM.</a>
<a id='line_124'>I heard not of it before.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_127'>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_128'>Gerard de Narbon?</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_131'>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those</a>
<a id='line_132'>hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she</a>
<a id='line_133'>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind</a>
<a id='line_134'>carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are</a>
<a id='line_135'>virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their</a>
<a id='line_136'>simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_139'>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_142'>’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance</a>
<a id='line_143'>of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows</a>
<a id='line_144'>takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no</a>
<a id='line_145'>more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_148'>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_151'>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the</a>
<a id='line_152'>enemy to the living.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_155'>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>BERTRAM.</a>
<a id='line_158'>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_161'>How understand we that?</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_164'>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</a>
<a id='line_165'>In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue</a>
<a id='line_166'>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</a>
<a id='line_167'>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</a>
<a id='line_168'>Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy</a>
<a id='line_169'>Rather in power than use; and keep thy friend</a>
<a id='line_170'>Under thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence,</a>
<a id='line_171'>But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,</a>
<a id='line_172'>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</a>
<a id='line_173'>Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,</a>
<a id='line_174'>’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,</a>
<a id='line_175'>Advise him.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_178'>He cannot want the best</a>
<a id='line_179'>That shall attend his love.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>COUNTESS.</a>
<a id='line_182'>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</a>

<a id='line_184'> [_Exit Countess._]</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>BERTRAM.</a>
<a id='line_187'>The best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you!</a>
<a id='line_188'>[_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make</a>
<a id='line_189'>much of her.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>LAFEW.</a>
<a id='line_192'>Farewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'> [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_197'>O, were that all! I think not on my father,</a>
<a id='line_198'>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</a>
<a id='line_199'>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</a>
<a id='line_200'>I have forgot him; my imagination</a>
<a id='line_201'>Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.</a>
<a id='line_202'>I am undone: there is no living, none,</a>
<a id='line_203'>If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one</a>
<a id='line_204'>That I should love a bright particular star,</a>
<a id='line_205'>And think to wed it, he is so above me.</a>
<a id='line_206'>In his bright radiance and collateral light</a>
<a id='line_207'>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</a>
<a id='line_208'>Th’ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</a>
<a id='line_209'>The hind that would be mated by the lion</a>
<a id='line_210'>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague,</a>
<a id='line_211'>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</a>
<a id='line_212'>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</a>
<a id='line_213'>In our heart’s table,—heart too capable</a>
<a id='line_214'>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.</a>
<a id='line_215'>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</a>
<a id='line_216'>Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'> Enter Parolles.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake,</a>
<a id='line_221'>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</a>
<a id='line_222'>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</a>
<a id='line_223'>Yet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him</a>
<a id='line_224'>That they take place when virtue’s steely bones</a>
<a id='line_225'>Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see</a>
<a id='line_226'>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_229'>Save you, fair queen!</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_232'>And you, monarch!</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_235'>No.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_238'>And no.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_241'>Are you meditating on virginity?</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_244'>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question.</a>
<a id='line_245'>Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_248'>Keep him out.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_251'>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet</a>
<a id='line_252'>is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_255'>There is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow</a>
<a id='line_256'>you up.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_259'>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no</a>
<a id='line_260'>military policy how virgins might blow up men?</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_263'>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in</a>
<a id='line_264'>blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your</a>
<a id='line_265'>city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve</a>
<a id='line_266'>virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never</a>
<a id='line_267'>virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</a>
<a id='line_268'>metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times</a>
<a id='line_269'>found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion.</a>
<a id='line_270'>Away with it!</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_273'>I will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_276'>There’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To</a>
<a id='line_277'>speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most</a>
<a id='line_278'>infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity</a>
<a id='line_279'>murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified</a>
<a id='line_280'>limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds</a>
<a id='line_281'>mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so</a>
<a id='line_282'>dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,</a>
<a id='line_283'>proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</a>
<a id='line_284'>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within</a>
<a id='line_285'>the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the</a>
<a id='line_286'>principal itself not much the worse. Away with it!</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_289'>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>PAROLLES.</a>
<a id='line_292'>Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a</a>
<a id='line_293'>commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less</a>
<a id='line_294'>worth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request.</a>
<a id='line_295'>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly</a>
<a id='line_296'>suited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which</a>
<a id='line_297'>wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in</a>
<a id='line_298'>your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our</a>
<a id='line_299'>French wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a</a>
<a id='line_300'>wither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear.</a>
<a id='line_301'>Will you anything with it?</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_304'>Not my virginity yet.</a>
<a id='line_305'>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</a>
<a id='line_306'>A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,</a>
<a id='line_307'>A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,</a>
<a id='line_308'>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_309'>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear:</a>
<a id='line_310'>His humble ambition, proud humility,</a>

<a id='line_315'>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</a>

<a id='line_320'></a>

<a id='line_325'>What’s pity?</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_328'>That wishing well had not a body in’t</a>
