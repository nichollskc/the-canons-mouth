<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     Death Of Honorius.—Valentinian III.—Emperor Of The East.</a>
<a id='line_3'>     —Administration Of His Mother Placidia—Ætius And</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Boniface.—Conquest Of Africa By The Vandals.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      During a long and disgraceful reign of twenty-eight years,</a>
<a id='line_7'>      Honorius, emperor of the West, was separated from the friendship</a>
<a id='line_8'>      of his brother, and afterwards of his nephew, who reigned over</a>
<a id='line_9'>      the East; and Constantinople beheld, with apparent indifference</a>
<a id='line_10'>      and secret joy, the calamities of Rome. The strange adventures of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Placidia 1 gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the two</a>
<a id='line_12'>      empires. The daughter of the great Theodosius had been the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      captive, and the queen, of the Goths; she lost an affectionate</a>
<a id='line_14'>      husband; she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin; she</a>
<a id='line_15'>      tasted the pleasure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of peace, for six hundred thousand measures of wheat. After her</a>
<a id='line_17'>      return from Spain to Italy, Placidia experienced a new</a>
<a id='line_18'>      persecution in the bosom of her family. She was averse to a</a>
<a id='line_19'>      marriage, which had been stipulated without her consent; and the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      brave Constantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had</a>
<a id='line_21'>      vanquished, received, from the hand of Honorius himself, the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      struggling and the reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus. But</a>
<a id='line_23'>      her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials: nor did</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Placidia refuse to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian</a>
<a id='line_25'>      the Third, or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the mind of her grateful husband. The generous soldier, whose</a>
<a id='line_27'>      time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and</a>
<a id='line_28'>      military service, was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition:</a>
<a id='line_29'>      he extorted the title of Augustus: and the servant of Honorius</a>
<a id='line_30'>      was associated to the empire of the West. The death of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Constantius, in the seventh month of his reign, instead of</a>
<a id='line_32'>      diminishing, seemed to inerease the power of Placidia; and the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      indecent familiarity 2 of her brother, which might be no more</a>
<a id='line_34'>      than the symptoms of a childish affection, were universally</a>
<a id='line_35'>      attributed to incestuous love. On a sudden, by some base</a>
<a id='line_36'>      intrigues of a steward and a nurse, this excessive fondness was</a>
<a id='line_37'>      converted into an irreconcilable quarrel: the debates of the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of</a>
<a id='line_39'>      the palace; and as the Gothic soldiers adhered to their queen,</a>
<a id='line_40'>      the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous</a>
<a id='line_41'>      tumults, which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary</a>
<a id='line_42'>      retreat of Placidia and her children. The royal exiles landed at</a>
<a id='line_43'>      Constantinople, soon after the marriage of Theodosius, during the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      festival of the Persian victories. They were treated with</a>
<a id='line_45'>      kindness and magnificence; but as the statues of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_46'>      Constantius had been rejected by the Eastern court, the title of</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Augusta could not decently be allowed to his widow. Within a few</a>
<a id='line_48'>      months after the arrival of Placidia, a swift messenger announced</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the death of Honorius, the consequence of a dropsy; but the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      important secret was not divulged, till the necessary orders had</a>
<a id='line_51'>      been despatched for the march of a large body of troops to the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      sea-coast of Dalmatia. The shops and the gates of Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_53'>      remained shut during seven days; and the loss of a foreign</a>
<a id='line_54'>      prince, who could neither be esteemed nor regretted, was</a>
<a id='line_55'>      celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public</a>
<a id='line_56'>      grief.</a>

<a id='line_60'>      2 (return) [ It is the expression of Olympiodorus (apud Phetium</a>
<a id='line_61'>      p. 197;) who means, perhaps, to describe the same caresses which</a>
<a id='line_62'>      Mahomet bestowed on his daughter Phatemah. Quando, (says the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      prophet himself,) quando subit mihi desiderium Paradisi, osculor</a>
<a id='line_64'>      eam, et ingero linguam meam in os ejus. But this sensual</a>
<a id='line_65'>      indulgence was justified by miracle and mystery; and the anecdote</a>
<a id='line_66'>      has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Father</a>
<a id='line_67'>      Maracci in his Version and Confutation of the Koran, tom. i. p.</a>
<a id='line_68'>      32.]</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>      While the ministers of Constantinople deliberated, the vacant</a>
<a id='line_71'>      throne of Honorius was usurped by the ambition of a stranger. The</a>
<a id='line_72'>      name of the rebel was John; he filled the confidential office of</a>
<a id='line_73'>      Primicerius, or principal secretary, and history has attributed</a>
<a id='line_74'>      to his character more virtues, than can easily be reconciled with</a>
<a id='line_75'>      the violation of the most sacred duty. Elated by the submission</a>
<a id='line_76'>      of Italy, and the hope of an alliance with the Huns, John</a>
<a id='line_77'>      presumed to insult, by an embassy, the majesty of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_78'>      emperor; but when he understood that his agents had been</a>
<a id='line_79'>      banished, imprisoned, and at length chased away with deserved</a>
<a id='line_80'>      ignominy, John prepared to assert, by arms, the injustice of his</a>
<a id='line_81'>      claims. In such a cause, the grandson of the great Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_82'>      should have marched in person: but the young emperor was easily</a>
<a id='line_83'>      diverted, by his physicians, from so rash and hazardous a design;</a>
<a id='line_84'>      and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently intrusted</a>
<a id='line_85'>      to Ardaburius, and his son Aspar, who had already signalized</a>
<a id='line_86'>      their valor against the Persians. It was resolved, that</a>
<a id='line_87'>      Ardaburius should embark with the infantry; whilst Aspar, at the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      head of the cavalry, conducted Placidia and her son Valentinian</a>
<a id='line_89'>      along the sea-coast of the Adriatic. The march of the cavalry was</a>
<a id='line_90'>      performed with such active diligence, that they surprised,</a>
<a id='line_91'>      without resistance, the important city of Aquileia: when the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      hopes of Aspar were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence,</a>
<a id='line_93'>      that a storm had dispersed the Imperial fleet; and that his</a>
<a id='line_94'>      father, with only two galleys, was taken and carried a prisoner</a>
<a id='line_95'>      into the port of Ravenna. Yet this incident, unfortunate as it</a>
<a id='line_96'>      might seem, facilitated the conquest of Italy. Ardaburius</a>
<a id='line_97'>      employed, or abused, the courteous freedom which he was permitted</a>
<a id='line_98'>      to enjoy, to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and</a>
<a id='line_99'>      gratitude; and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution,</a>
<a id='line_100'>      he invited, by private messages, and pressed the approach of,</a>
<a id='line_101'>      Aspar. A shepherd, whom the popular credulity transformed into an</a>
<a id='line_102'>      angel, guided the eastern cavalry by a secret, and, it was</a>
<a id='line_103'>      thought, an impassable road, through the morasses of the Po: the</a>
<a id='line_104'>      gates of Ravenna, after a short struggle, were thrown open; and</a>
<a id='line_105'>      the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy, or rather to</a>
<a id='line_106'>      the cruelty, of the conquerors. His right hand was first cut off;</a>
<a id='line_107'>      and, after he had been exposed, mounted on an ass, to the public</a>
<a id='line_108'>      derision, John was beheaded in the circus of Aquileia. The</a>
<a id='line_109'>      emperor Theodosius, when he received the news of the victory,</a>
<a id='line_110'>      interrupted the horse-races; and singing, as he marched through</a>
<a id='line_111'>      the streets, a suitable psalm, conducted his people from the</a>
<a id='line_112'>      Hippodrome to the church, where he spent the remainder of the day</a>
<a id='line_113'>      in grateful devotion. 3</a>

<a id='line_122'>      In a monarchy, which, according to various precedents, might be</a>
<a id='line_123'>      considered as elective, or hereditary, or patrimonial, it was</a>
<a id='line_124'>      impossible that the intricate claims of female and collateral</a>
<a id='line_125'>      succession should be clearly defined; 4 and Theodosius, by the</a>
<a id='line_126'>      right of consanguinity or conquest, might have reigned the sole</a>
<a id='line_127'>      legitimate emperor of the Romans. For a moment, perhaps, his eyes</a>
<a id='line_128'>      were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway; but his indolent</a>
<a id='line_129'>      temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy. He</a>
<a id='line_130'>      contented himself with the possession of the East; and wisely</a>
<a id='line_131'>      relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_132'>      war against the Barbarians beyond the Alps; or of securing the</a>
<a id='line_133'>      obedience of the Italians and Africans, whose minds were</a>
<a id='line_134'>      alienated by the irreconcilable difference of language and</a>
<a id='line_135'>      interest. Instead of listening to the voice of ambition,</a>
<a id='line_136'>      Theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather,</a>
<a id='line_137'>      and to seat his cousin Valentinian on the throne of the West. The</a>
<a id='line_138'>      royal infant was distinguished at Constantinople by the title of</a>
<a id='line_139'>      Nobilissimus: he was promoted, before his departure from</a>
<a id='line_140'>      Thessalonica, to the rank and dignity of Caesar; and after the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      conquest of Italy, the patrician Helion, by the authority of</a>
<a id='line_142'>      Theodosius, and in the presence of the senate, saluted</a>
<a id='line_143'>      Valentinian the Third by the name of Augustus, and solemnly</a>
<a id='line_144'>      invested him with the diadem and the Imperial purple. 5 By the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      agreement of the three females who governed the Roman world, the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      son of Placidia was betrothed to Eudoxia, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_147'>      Theodosius and Athenais; and as soon as the lover and his bride</a>
<a id='line_148'>      had attained the age of puberty, this honorable alliance was</a>
<a id='line_149'>      faithfully accomplished. At the same time, as a compensation,</a>
<a id='line_150'>      perhaps, for the expenses of the war, the Western Illyricum was</a>
<a id='line_151'>      detached from the Italian dominions, and yielded to the throne of</a>
<a id='line_152'>      Constantinople. 6 The emperor of the East acquired the useful</a>
<a id='line_153'>      dominion of the rich and maritime province of Dalmatia, and the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      dangerous sovereignty of Pannonia and Noricum, which had been</a>
<a id='line_155'>      filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of</a>
<a id='line_156'>      Huns, Ostrogoths, Vandals, and Bavarians. Theodosius and</a>
<a id='line_157'>      Valentinian continued to respect the obligations of their public</a>
<a id='line_158'>      and domestic alliance; but the unity of the Roman government was</a>
<a id='line_159'>      finally dissolved. By a positive declaration, the validity of all</a>
<a id='line_160'>      future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar</a>

<a id='line_182'>      ratifies and communicates (A.D. 438) the Theodosian Code. About</a>
<a id='line_183'>      forty years before that time, the unity of legislation had been</a>
<a id='line_184'>      proved by an exception. The Jews, who were numerous in the cities</a>
<a id='line_185'>      of Apulia and Calabria, produced a law of the East to justify</a>
<a id='line_186'>      their exemption from municipal offices, (Cod. Theod. l. xvi. tit.</a>

<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>      Valentinian, when he received the title of Augustus, was no more</a>
<a id='line_192'>      than six years of age; and his long minority was intrusted to the</a>
<a id='line_193'>      guardian care of a mother, who might assert a female claim to the</a>
<a id='line_194'>      succession of the Western empire. Placidia envied, but she could</a>
<a id='line_195'>      not equal, the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of</a>
<a id='line_196'>      Theodosius, the elegant genius of Eudocia, the wise and</a>
<a id='line_197'>      successful policy of Pulcheria. The mother of Valentinian was</a>
<a id='line_198'>      jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising; 8 she</a>
<a id='line_199'>      reigned twenty-five years, in the name of her son; and the</a>
<a id='line_200'>      character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      suspicion that Placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute</a>
<a id='line_202'>      education, and studiously diverted his attention from every manly</a>
<a id='line_203'>      and honorable pursuit. Amidst the decay of military spirit, her</a>
<a id='line_204'>      armies were commanded by two generals, Ætius 9 and Boniface, 10</a>
<a id='line_205'>      who may be deservedly named as the last of the Romans. Their</a>
<a id='line_206'>      union might have supported a sinking empire; their discord was</a>
<a id='line_207'>      the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of Africa. The invasion</a>
<a id='line_208'>      and defeat of Attila have immortalized the fame of Ætius; and</a>
<a id='line_209'>      though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival,</a>
<a id='line_210'>      the defence of Marseilles, and the deliverance of Africa, attest</a>
<a id='line_211'>      the military talents of Count Boniface. In the field of battle,</a>
<a id='line_212'>      in partial encounters, in single combats, he was still the terror</a>
<a id='line_213'>      of the Barbarians: the clergy, and particularly his friend</a>
<a id='line_214'>      Augustin, were edified by the Christian piety which had once</a>
<a id='line_215'>      tempted him to retire from the world; the people applauded his</a>
<a id='line_216'>      spotless integrity; the army dreaded his equal and inexorable</a>
<a id='line_217'>      justice, which may be displayed in a very singular example. A</a>
<a id='line_218'>      peasant, who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife</a>
<a id='line_219'>      and a Gothic soldier, was directed to attend his tribunal the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      following day: in the evening the count, who had diligently</a>
<a id='line_221'>      informed himself of the time and place of the assignation,</a>
<a id='line_222'>      mounted his horse, rode ten miles into the country, surprised the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      guilty couple, punished the soldier with instant death, and</a>
<a id='line_224'>      silenced the complaints of the husband by presenting him, the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      next morning, with the head of the adulterer. The abilities of</a>
<a id='line_226'>      Ætius and Boniface might have been usefully employed against the</a>
<a id='line_227'>      public enemies, in separate and important commands; but the</a>
<a id='line_228'>      experience of their past conduct should have decided the real</a>
<a id='line_229'>      favor and confidence of the empress Placidia. In the melancholy</a>
<a id='line_230'>      season of her exile and distress, Boniface alone had maintained</a>
<a id='line_231'>      her cause with unshaken fidelity: and the troops and treasures of</a>
<a id='line_232'>      Africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion.</a>
<a id='line_233'>      The same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of</a>
<a id='line_234'>      Ætius, who brought an army of sixty thousand Huns from the</a>
<a id='line_235'>      Danube to the confines of Italy, for the service of the usurper.</a>
<a id='line_236'>      The untimely death of John compelled him to accept an</a>
<a id='line_237'>      advantageous treaty; but he still continued, the subject and the</a>
<a id='line_238'>      soldier of Valentinian, to entertain a secret, perhaps a</a>
<a id='line_239'>      treasonable, correspondence with his Barbarian allies, whose</a>
<a id='line_240'>      retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts, and more liberal</a>
<a id='line_241'>      promises. But Ætius possessed an advantage of singular moment in</a>
<a id='line_242'>      a female reign; he was present: he besieged, with artful and</a>
<a id='line_243'>      assiduous flattery, the palace of Ravenna; disguised his dark</a>
<a id='line_244'>      designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship; and at length</a>
<a id='line_245'>      deceived both his mistress and his absent rival, by a subtle</a>
<a id='line_246'>      conspiracy, which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily</a>
<a id='line_247'>      suspect. He had secretly persuaded 11 Placidia to recall Boniface</a>

<a id='line_249'>      disobey the Imperial summons: to the one, he represented the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      order as a sentence of death; to the other, he stated the refusal</a>
<a id='line_251'>      as a signal of revolt; and when the credulous and unsuspectful</a>
<a id='line_252'>      count had armed the province in his defence, Ætius applauded his</a>
<a id='line_253'>      sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion, which his own perfidy had</a>

<a id='line_257'>      inflame, and the count was urged, by persecution, to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_258'>      most desperate counsels. The success with which he eluded or</a>
<a id='line_259'>      repelled the first attacks, could not inspire a vain confidence,</a>

<a id='line_307'>      acquired a more effectual opposition; and the master-general</a>

<a id='line_314'>      vessels which they found in the harbor of Carthagena might easily</a>
<a id='line_315'>      transport them to the Isles of Majorca and Minorca, where the</a>
<a id='line_316'>      Spanish fugitives, as in a secure recess, had vainly concealed</a>

<a id='line_323'>      brother, the terrible Genseric; 13 a name, which, in the</a>
<a id='line_324'>      destruction of the Roman empire, has deserved an equal rank with</a>
<a id='line_325'>      the names of Alaric and Attila. The king of the Vandals is</a>
<a id='line_326'>      described to have been of a middle stature, with a lameness in</a>

<a id='line_328'>      horse. His slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep</a>
<a id='line_329'>      purposes of his soul; he disdained to imitate the luxury of the</a>
<a id='line_330'>      vanquished; but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and</a>
<a id='line_331'>      revenge. The ambition of Genseric was without bounds and without</a>
<a id='line_332'>      scruples; and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark</a>
<a id='line_333'>      engines of policy to solicit the allies who might be useful to</a>
<a id='line_334'>      his success, or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred</a>

<a id='line_380'>      term of human life, from the cold of Scythia to the excessive</a>

<a id='line_389'>      scarcely have swelled his army to the number of four-score</a>
<a id='line_390'>      thousand persons. 15 But his own dexterity, and the discontents</a>
<a id='line_391'>      of Africa, soon fortified the Vandal powers, by the accession of</a>
<a id='line_392'>      numerous and active allies. The parts of Mauritania which border</a>

<a id='line_436'>      rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his</a>
<a id='line_437'>      patience and clemency. Three hundred bishops, 18 with many</a>
<a id='line_438'>      thousands of the inferior clergy, were torn from their churches,</a>
<a id='line_439'>      stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions, banished to the</a>
<a id='line_440'>      islands, and proscribed by the laws, if they presumed to conceal</a>
<a id='line_441'>      themselves in the provinces of Africa. Their numerous</a>
<a id='line_442'>      congregations, both in cities and in the country, were deprived</a>
<a id='line_443'>      of the rights of citizens, and of the exercise of religious</a>
<a id='line_444'>      worship. A regular scale of fines, from ten to two hundred pounds</a>
<a id='line_445'>      of silver, was curiously ascertained, according to the</a>
<a id='line_446'>      distinction of rank and fortune, to punish the crime of assisting</a>
<a id='line_447'>      at a schismatic conventicle; and if the fine had been levied five</a>
<a id='line_448'>      times, without subduing the obstinacy of the offender, his future</a>

<a id='line_611'>      siege, and in the seventy-sixth year of his age, from the actual</a>
<a id='line_612'>      and the impending calamities of his country. The youth of</a>
<a id='line_613'>      Augustin had been stained by the vices and errors which he so</a>
<a id='line_614'>      ingenuously confesses; but from the moment of his conversion to</a>
<a id='line_615'>      that of his death, the manners of the bishop of Hippo were pure</a>
<a id='line_616'>      and austere: and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an</a>
<a id='line_617'>      ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination; the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      Manichæans, the Donatists, and the Pelagians, against whom he</a>
<a id='line_619'>      waged a perpetual controversy. When the city, some months after</a>

<a id='line_693'>      By the skill of Boniface, and perhaps by the ignorance of the</a>
<a id='line_694'>      Vandals, the siege of Hippo was protracted above fourteen months:</a>

<a id='line_696'>      been exhausted by irregular rapine, the besiegers themselves were</a>
<a id='line_697'>      compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise. The</a>
<a id='line_698'>      importance and danger of Africa were deeply felt by the regent of</a>
<a id='line_699'>      the West. Placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally;</a>
<a id='line_700'>      and the Italian fleet and army were reenforced by Asper, who</a>
<a id='line_701'>      sailed from Constantinople with a powerful armament. As soon as</a>
<a id='line_702'>      the force of the two empires was united under the command of</a>
<a id='line_703'>      Boniface, he boldly marched against the Vandals; and the loss of</a>
<a id='line_704'>      a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa. He</a>
<a id='line_705'>      embarked with the precipitation of despair; and the people of</a>
<a id='line_706'>      Hippo were permitted, with their families and effects, to occupy</a>
<a id='line_707'>      the vacant place of the soldiers, the greatest part of whom were</a>
<a id='line_708'>      either slain or made prisoners by the Vandals. The count, whose</a>

<a id='line_710'>      enter the palace of Ravenna with some anxiety, which was soon</a>
<a id='line_711'>      removed by the smiles of Placidia. Boniface accepted with</a>
<a id='line_712'>      gratitude the rank of patrician, and the dignity of</a>
<a id='line_713'>      master-general of the Roman armies; but he must have blushed at</a>
<a id='line_714'>      the sight of those medals, in which he was represented with the</a>
<a id='line_715'>      name and attributes of victory. 32 The discovery of his fraud,</a>
<a id='line_716'>      the displeasure of the empress, and the distinguished favor of</a>
<a id='line_717'>      his rival, exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of Ætius.</a>
<a id='line_718'>      He hastily returned from Gaul to Italy, with a retinue, or rather</a>

<a id='line_753'>      It might naturally be expected, after the retreat of Boniface,</a>
<a id='line_754'>      that the Vandals would achieve, without resistance or delay, the</a>
<a id='line_755'>      conquest of Africa. Eight years, however, elapsed, from the</a>
<a id='line_756'>      evacuation of Hippo to the reduction of Carthage. In the midst of</a>
<a id='line_757'>      that interval, the ambitious Genseric, in the full tide of</a>
<a id='line_758'>      apparent prosperity, negotiated a treaty of peace, by which he</a>
<a id='line_759'>      gave his son Hunneric for a hostage; and consented to leave the</a>
<a id='line_760'>      Western emperor in the undisturbed possession of the three</a>
<a id='line_761'>      Mauritanias. 34 This moderation, which cannot be imputed to the</a>
<a id='line_762'>      justice, must be ascribed to the policy, of the conqueror.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>      His throne was encompassed with domestic enemies, who accused the</a>
<a id='line_765'>      baseness of his birth, and asserted the legitimate claims of his</a>
<a id='line_766'>      nephews, the sons of Gonderic. Those nephews, indeed, he</a>
<a id='line_767'>      sacrificed to his safety; and their mother, the widow of the</a>
<a id='line_768'>      deceased king, was precipitated, by his order, into the river</a>
<a id='line_769'>      Ampsaga. But the public discontent burst forth in dangerous and</a>
<a id='line_770'>      frequent conspiracies; and the warlike tyrant is supposed to have</a>
<a id='line_771'>      shed more Vandal blood by the hand of the executioner, than in</a>
<a id='line_772'>      the field of battle. 35 The convulsions of Africa, which had</a>
<a id='line_773'>      favored his attack, opposed the firm establishment of his power;</a>
<a id='line_774'>      and the various seditions of the Moors and Germans, the Donatists</a>
<a id='line_775'>      and Catholics, continually disturbed, or threatened, the</a>
<a id='line_776'>      unsettled reign of the conqueror. As he advanced towards</a>
<a id='line_777'>      Carthage, he was forced to withdraw his troops from the Western</a>
<a id='line_778'>      provinces; the sea-coast was exposed to the naval enterprises of</a>
<a id='line_779'>      the Romans of Spain and Italy; and, in the heart of Numidia, the</a>
<a id='line_780'>      strong inland city of Corta still persisted in obstinate</a>
<a id='line_781'>      independence. 36 These difficulties were gradually subdued by the</a>
<a id='line_782'>      spirit, the perseverance, and the cruelty of Genseric; who</a>
<a id='line_783'>      alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the</a>
<a id='line_784'>      establishment of his African kingdom. He subscribed a solemn</a>
<a id='line_785'>      treaty, with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of</a>
<a id='line_786'>      its continuance, and the moment of its violation. The vigilance</a>
<a id='line_787'>      of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship,</a>
<a id='line_788'>      which concealed his hostile approach; and Carthage was at length</a>

<a id='line_818'>      displayed, in a dependent condition, the image of a flourishing</a>
<a id='line_819'>      republic. Carthage contained the manufactures, the arms, and the</a>
<a id='line_820'>      treasures of the six provinces. A regular subordination of civil</a>
<a id='line_821'>      honors gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and</a>
<a id='line_822'>      quarters of the city, to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate,</a>
<a id='line_823'>      who, with the title of proconsul, represented the state and</a>
<a id='line_824'>      dignity of a consul of ancient Rome. Schools and gymnasia were</a>
<a id='line_825'>      instituted for the education of the African youth; and the</a>
<a id='line_826'>      liberal arts and manners, grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, were</a>
<a id='line_827'>      publicly taught in the Greek and Latin languages. The buildings</a>
<a id='line_828'>      of Carthage were uniform and magnificent; a shady grove was</a>
<a id='line_829'>      planted in the midst of the capital; the new port, a secure and</a>
<a id='line_830'>      capacious harbor, was subservient to the commercial industry of</a>
<a id='line_831'>      citizens and strangers; and the splendid games of the circus and</a>
<a id='line_832'>      theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_833'>      The reputation of the Carthaginians was not equal to that of</a>
<a id='line_834'>      their country, and the reproach of Punic faith still adhered to</a>

<a id='line_837'>      impious contempt of monks, and the shameless practice of</a>

<a id='line_899'>      such calamities, could enjoy more real happiness than was the</a>
<a id='line_900'>      ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity. The story of Maria, the</a>
<a id='line_901'>      daughter of the magnificent Eudaemon, is singular and</a>
<a id='line_902'>      interesting. In the sack of Carthage, she was purchased from the</a>
<a id='line_903'>      Vandals by some merchants of Syria, who afterwards sold her as a</a>
<a id='line_904'>      slave in their native country. A female attendant, transported in</a>
<a id='line_905'>      the same ship, and sold in the same family, still continued to</a>
<a id='line_906'>      respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level</a>
<a id='line_907'>      of servitude; and the daughter of Eudaemon received from her</a>
<a id='line_908'>      grateful affection the domestic services which she had once</a>
<a id='line_909'>      required from her obedience. This remarkable behavior divulged</a>
<a id='line_910'>      the real condition of Maria, who, in the absence of the bishop of</a>
<a id='line_911'>      Cyrrhus, was redeemed from slavery by the generosity of some</a>
<a id='line_912'>      soldiers of the garrison. The liberality of Theodoret provided</a>

<a id='line_930'></a>
<a id='line_931'>      Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history, I am tempted</a>
<a id='line_932'>      to distinguish the memorable fable of the Seven Sleepers; 43</a>
<a id='line_933'>      whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger</a>
<a id='line_934'>      Theodosius, and the conquest of Africa by the Vandals. 44 When</a>
<a id='line_935'>      the emperor Decius persecuted the Christians, seven noble youths</a>
<a id='line_936'>      of Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side</a>
<a id='line_937'>      of an adjacent mountain; where they were doomed to perish by the</a>
<a id='line_938'>      tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly</a>
<a id='line_939'>      secured by the a pile of huge stones. They immediately fell into</a>
<a id='line_940'>      a deep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged without injuring</a>
<a id='line_941'>      the powers of life, during a period of one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_942'>      eighty-seven years. At the end of that time, the slaves of</a>
<a id='line_943'>      Adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended,</a>
<a id='line_944'>      removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice:</a>
<a id='line_945'>      the light of the sun darted into the cavern, and the Seven</a>
<a id='line_946'>      Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a slumber, as they</a>
<a id='line_947'>      thought of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger;</a>
<a id='line_948'>      and resolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, should</a>
<a id='line_949'>      secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his</a>
<a id='line_950'>      companions. The youth (if we may still employ that appellation)</a>
<a id='line_951'>      could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native</a>
<a id='line_952'>      country; and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a</a>
<a id='line_953'>      large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of</a>
<a id='line_954'>      Ephesus. His singular dress, and obsolete language, confounded</a>
<a id='line_955'>      the baker, to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the</a>
<a id='line_956'>      current coin of the empire; and Jamblichus, on the suspicion of a</a>
<a id='line_957'>      secret treasure, was dragged before the judge. Their mutual</a>
<a id='line_958'>      inquiries produced the amazing discovery, that two centuries were</a>
<a id='line_959'>      almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his friends had escaped from</a>
<a id='line_960'>      the rage of a Pagan tyrant. The bishop of Ephesus, the clergy,</a>
<a id='line_961'>      the magistrates, the people, and, as it is said, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_962'>      Theodosius himself, hastened to visit the cavern of the Seven</a>
<a id='line_963'>      Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, related their story,</a>
<a id='line_964'>      and at the same instant peaceably expired. The origin of this</a>
<a id='line_965'>      marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and</a>
<a id='line_966'>      credulity of the modern Greeks, since the authentic tradition may</a>
<a id='line_967'>      be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle. James of</a>
<a id='line_968'>      Sarug, a Syrian bishop, who was born only two years after the</a>
<a id='line_969'>      death of the younger Theodosius, has devoted one of his two</a>
<a id='line_970'>      hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of</a>
<a id='line_971'>      Ephesus. 45 Their legend, before the end of the sixth century,</a>
<a id='line_972'>      was translated from the Syriac into the Latin language, by the</a>
<a id='line_973'>      care of Gregory of Tours. The hostile communions of the East</a>
<a id='line_974'>      preserve their memory with equal reverence; and their names are</a>
<a id='line_975'>      honorably inscribed in the Roman, the Abyssinian, and the Russian</a>
<a id='line_976'>      calendar. 46 Nor has their reputation been confined to the</a>
<a id='line_977'>      Christian world. This popular tale, which Mahomet might learn</a>
<a id='line_978'>      when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced as</a>
<a id='line_979'>      a divine revelation, into the Koran. 47 The story of the Seven</a>
<a id='line_980'>      Sleepers has been adopted and adorned by the nations, from Bengal</a>
<a id='line_981'>      to Africa, who profess the Mahometan religion; 48 and some</a>
<a id='line_982'>      vestiges of a similar tradition have been discovered in the</a>
<a id='line_983'>      remote extremities of Scandinavia. 49 This easy and universal</a>
<a id='line_984'>      belief, so expressive of the sense of mankind, may be ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_985'>      the genuine merit of the fable itself. We imperceptibly advance</a>
<a id='line_986'>      from youth to age, without observing the gradual, but incessant,</a>
<a id='line_987'>      change of human affairs; and even in our larger experience of</a>
<a id='line_988'>      history, the imagination is accustomed, by a perpetual series of</a>
<a id='line_989'>      causes and effects, to unite the most distant revolutions. But if</a>
<a id='line_990'>      the interval between two memorable eras could be instantly</a>
<a id='line_991'>      annihilated; if it were possible, after a momentary slumber of</a>
<a id='line_992'>      two hundred years, to display the new world to the eyes of a</a>
<a id='line_993'>      spectator, who still retained a lively and recent impression of</a>
<a id='line_994'>      the old, his surprise and his reflections would furnish the</a>
<a id='line_995'>      pleasing subject of a philosophical romance. The scene could not</a>
<a id='line_996'>      be more advantageously placed, than in the two centuries which</a>
<a id='line_997'>      elapsed between the reigns of Decius and of Theodosius the</a>
<a id='line_998'>      Younger. During this period, the seat of government had been</a>
<a id='line_999'>      transported from Rome to a new city on the banks of the Thracian</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      Bosphorus; and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude. The</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      throne of the persecuting Decius was filled by a succession of</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      Christian and orthodox princes, who had extirpated the fabulous</a>
