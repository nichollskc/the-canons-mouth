                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that</a>
<a id='line_4'>were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 1:2 To whom the word of the</a>
<a id='line_5'>LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the</a>
<a id='line_6'>thirteenth year of his reign.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of</a>
<a id='line_9'>Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah</a>
<a id='line_10'>king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the</a>
<a id='line_11'>fifth month.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 1:5 Before I</a>
<a id='line_14'>formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out</a>
<a id='line_15'>of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the</a>
<a id='line_16'>nations.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a</a>
<a id='line_19'>child.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_22'>go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou</a>
<a id='line_23'>shalt speak.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,</a>
<a id='line_26'>saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the</a>
<a id='line_29'>LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the</a>
<a id='line_32'>kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw</a>
<a id='line_33'>down, to build, and to plant.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,</a>
<a id='line_36'>what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:12 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will</a>
<a id='line_39'>hasten my word to perform it.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:13 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,</a>
<a id='line_42'>What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face</a>
<a id='line_43'>thereof is toward the north.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:14 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break</a>
<a id='line_46'>forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the</a>
<a id='line_49'>north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every</a>
<a id='line_50'>one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against</a>
<a id='line_51'>all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of</a>
<a id='line_52'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>1:16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their</a>
<a id='line_55'>wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other</a>
<a id='line_56'>gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them</a>
<a id='line_59'>all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I</a>
<a id='line_60'>confound thee before them.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an</a>
<a id='line_63'>iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the</a>
<a id='line_64'>kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests</a>
<a id='line_65'>thereof, and against the people of the land.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>1:19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail</a>
<a id='line_68'>against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>2:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2:2 Go and cry</a>
<a id='line_71'>in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember</a>
<a id='line_72'>thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when</a>
<a id='line_73'>thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his</a>
<a id='line_76'>increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,</a>
<a id='line_77'>saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the</a>
<a id='line_80'>families of the house of Israel: 2:5 Thus saith the LORD, What</a>
<a id='line_81'>iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from</a>
<a id='line_82'>me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?  2:6 Neither</a>
<a id='line_83'>said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_84'>Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts</a>
<a id='line_85'>and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death,</a>
<a id='line_86'>through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</a>
<a id='line_87'>2:7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit</a>
<a id='line_88'>thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my</a>
<a id='line_89'>land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:8 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the</a>
<a id='line_92'>law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the</a>
<a id='line_93'>prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not</a>
<a id='line_94'>profit.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>2:9 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your</a>
<a id='line_97'>childrenâ€™s children will I plead.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,</a>
<a id='line_100'>and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:11 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my</a>
<a id='line_103'>people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be</a>
<a id='line_106'>ye very desolate, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>2:13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the</a>
<a id='line_109'>fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken</a>
<a id='line_110'>cisterns, that can hold no water.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:14 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?</a>
<a id='line_113'>2:15 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his</a>
<a id='line_114'>land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>2:16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of</a>
<a id='line_117'>thy head.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast</a>
<a id='line_120'>forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?  2:18 And now</a>
<a id='line_121'>what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of</a>
<a id='line_122'>Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the</a>
<a id='line_123'>waters of the river?  2:19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee,</a>
<a id='line_124'>and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that</a>
<a id='line_125'>it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_126'>God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>2:20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and</a>
<a id='line_129'>thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and</a>
<a id='line_130'>under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>2:21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how</a>
<a id='line_133'>then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto</a>
<a id='line_134'>me?  2:22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much</a>
<a id='line_135'>soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>2:23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after</a>
<a id='line_138'>Baalim?  see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art</a>
<a id='line_139'>a swift dromedary traversing her ways; 2:24 A wild ass used to the</a>
<a id='line_140'>wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion</a>
<a id='line_141'>who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary</a>
<a id='line_142'>themselves; in her month they shall find her.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>2:25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:</a>
<a id='line_145'>but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and</a>
<a id='line_146'>after them will I go.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of</a>
<a id='line_149'>Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests,</a>
<a id='line_150'>and their prophets.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>2:27 Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast</a>
<a id='line_153'>brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not</a>
<a id='line_154'>their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and</a>
<a id='line_155'>save us.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>2:28 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise,</a>
<a id='line_158'>if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the</a>
<a id='line_159'>number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>2:29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against</a>
<a id='line_162'>me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>2:30 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no</a>
<a id='line_165'>correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a</a>
<a id='line_166'>destroying lion.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>2:31 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a</a>
<a id='line_169'>wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people,</a>
<a id='line_170'>We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?  2:32 Can a maid forget</a>
<a id='line_171'>her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me</a>
<a id='line_172'>days without number.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>2:33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also</a>
<a id='line_175'>taught the wicked ones thy ways.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>2:34 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor</a>
<a id='line_178'>innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>2:35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall</a>
<a id='line_181'>turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I</a>
<a id='line_182'>have not sinned.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>2:36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt</a>
<a id='line_185'>be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>2:37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine</a>
<a id='line_188'>head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_189'>prosper in them.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>3:1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and</a>
<a id='line_192'>become another manâ€™s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that</a>
<a id='line_193'>land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many</a>
<a id='line_194'>lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>3:2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast</a>
<a id='line_197'>not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian</a>
<a id='line_198'>in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms</a>
<a id='line_199'>and with thy wickedness.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>3:3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no</a>
<a id='line_202'>latter rain; and thou hadst a whoreâ€™s forehead, thou refusedst to be</a>
<a id='line_203'>ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>3:4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the</a>
<a id='line_206'>guide of my youth?  3:5 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he</a>
<a id='line_207'>keep it to the end?  Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as</a>
<a id='line_208'>thou couldest.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>3:6 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast</a>
<a id='line_211'>thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon</a>
<a id='line_212'>every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played</a>
<a id='line_213'>the harlot.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>3:7 And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me.</a>
<a id='line_216'>But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>3:8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel</a>
<a id='line_219'>committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of</a>
<a id='line_220'>divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and</a>
<a id='line_221'>played the harlot also.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>3:9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that</a>
<a id='line_224'>she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with</a>
<a id='line_225'>stocks.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>3:10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned</a>
<a id='line_228'>unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>3:11 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified</a>
<a id='line_231'>herself more than treacherous Judah.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>3:12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,</a>
<a id='line_234'>thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine</a>
<a id='line_235'>anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will</a>
<a id='line_236'>not keep anger for ever.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>3:13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed</a>
<a id='line_239'>against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers</a>
<a id='line_240'>under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the</a>
<a id='line_241'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>3:14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married</a>
<a id='line_244'>unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and</a>
<a id='line_245'>I will bring you to Zion: 3:15 And I will give you pastors according</a>
<a id='line_246'>to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>3:16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in</a>
<a id='line_249'>the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The</a>
<a id='line_250'>ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind:</a>
<a id='line_251'>neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither</a>
<a id='line_252'>shall that be done any more.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>3:17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_255'>and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the</a>
<a id='line_256'>LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the</a>
<a id='line_257'>imagination of their evil heart.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>3:18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of</a>
<a id='line_260'>Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to</a>
<a id='line_261'>the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_262'></a>
<a id='line_263'>3:19 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give</a>
<a id='line_264'>thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I</a>
<a id='line_265'>said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>3:20 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so</a>
<a id='line_268'>have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the</a>
<a id='line_269'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>3:21 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications</a>
<a id='line_272'>of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they</a>
<a id='line_273'>have forgotten the LORD their God.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>3:22 Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your</a>
<a id='line_276'>backslidings.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>3:23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the</a>
<a id='line_281'>multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of</a>
<a id='line_282'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>3:24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth;</a>
<a id='line_285'>their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>3:25 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we</a>
<a id='line_288'>have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our</a>
<a id='line_289'>youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_290'>our God.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>4:1 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and</a>
<a id='line_293'>if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt</a>
<a id='line_294'>thou not remove.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>4:2 And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and</a>
<a id='line_297'>in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and</a>
<a id='line_298'>in him shall they glory.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>4:3 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break</a>
<a id='line_301'>up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of</a>
<a id='line_304'>your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury</a>
<a id='line_305'>come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the</a>
<a id='line_306'>evil of your doings.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>4:5 Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye</a>
<a id='line_309'>the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble</a>
<a id='line_310'>yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>4:6 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will</a>
<a id='line_313'>bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>4:7 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the</a>
<a id='line_316'>Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy</a>
<a id='line_317'>land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an</a>

<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>4:8 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce</a>
<a id='line_321'>anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>4:9 And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the</a>
<a id='line_324'>heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the</a>

<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>4:10 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this</a>

<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>4:11 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A</a>

<a id='line_334'>those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against</a>

<a id='line_337'>4:13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as</a>

<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>4:14 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_342'>be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?  4:15</a>

<a id='line_350'>4:17 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because</a>

<a id='line_352'></a>
<a id='line_353'>4:18 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this</a>

<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>4:19 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart</a>
<a id='line_358'>maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard,</a>

<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>4:20 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is</a>
<a id='line_362'>spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>4:21 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_365'>trumpet?  4:22 For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they</a>
<a id='line_366'>are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise</a>
<a id='line_367'>to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>4:23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and</a>
<a id='line_370'>the heavens, and they had no light.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>4:24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills</a>
<a id='line_373'>moved lightly.</a>
<a id='line_374'></a>
<a id='line_375'>4:25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the</a>
<a id='line_376'>heavens were fled.</a>
<a id='line_377'></a>
<a id='line_378'>4:26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all</a>
<a id='line_379'>the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_380'>by his fierce anger.</a>
<a id='line_381'></a>
<a id='line_382'>4:27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;</a>
<a id='line_383'>yet will I not make a full end.</a>
<a id='line_384'></a>
<a id='line_385'>4:28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;</a>
<a id='line_386'>because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,</a>
<a id='line_387'>neither will I turn back from it.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>4:29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and</a>
<a id='line_390'>bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:</a>
<a id='line_391'>every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>4:30 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou</a>
<a id='line_394'>clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments</a>
<a id='line_395'>of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt</a>
<a id='line_396'>thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek</a>
<a id='line_397'>thy life.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>4:31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the</a>
<a id='line_400'>anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of</a>
<a id='line_401'>the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her</a>
<a id='line_402'>hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of</a>

<a id='line_405'>5:1 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now,</a>
<a id='line_406'>and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man,</a>
<a id='line_407'>if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I</a>
<a id='line_408'>will pardon it.</a>
<a id='line_409'></a>
<a id='line_410'>5:2 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>5:3 O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken</a>
<a id='line_413'>them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they</a>
<a id='line_414'>have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder</a>
<a id='line_415'>than a rock; they have refused to return.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>5:4 Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for</a>
<a id='line_418'>they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>5:5 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for</a>
<a id='line_421'>they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God:</a>
<a id='line_422'>but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</a>
<a id='line_423'></a>
<a id='line_424'>5:6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of</a>
<a id='line_425'>the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their</a>
<a id='line_426'>cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces:</a>
<a id='line_427'>because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are</a>
<a id='line_428'>increased.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>5:7 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me,</a>
<a id='line_431'>and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full,</a>
<a id='line_432'>they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in</a>
<a id='line_433'>the harlotsâ€™ houses.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>5:8 They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after</a>
<a id='line_436'>his neighbours wife.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>5:9 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not</a>
<a id='line_439'>my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  5:10 Go ye up upon her</a>
<a id='line_440'>walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her</a>
<a id='line_441'>battlements; for they are not the LORDâ€™s.</a>
<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>5:11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very</a>
<a id='line_444'>treacherously against me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_445'></a>
<a id='line_446'>5:12 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall</a>
<a id='line_447'>evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 5:13 And the</a>
<a id='line_448'>prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it</a>
<a id='line_449'>be done unto them.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>5:14 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this</a>
<a id='line_452'>word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people</a>
<a id='line_453'>wood, and it shall devour them.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>5:15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_456'>saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a</a>
<a id='line_457'>nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what</a>
<a id='line_458'>they say.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>5:16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>5:17 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy</a>
<a id='line_463'>sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and</a>
<a id='line_464'>thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall</a>
<a id='line_465'>impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_466'></a>
<a id='line_467'>5:18 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a</a>
<a id='line_468'>full end with you.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>5:19 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the</a>
<a id='line_471'>LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them,</a>
<a id='line_472'>Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so</a>
<a id='line_473'>shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>5:20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,</a>
<a id='line_476'>saying, 5:21 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without</a>
<a id='line_477'>understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear</a>
<a id='line_478'>not: 5:22 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my</a>
<a id='line_479'>presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a</a>
<a id='line_480'>perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof</a>
<a id='line_481'>toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can</a>
<a id='line_482'>they not pass over it?  5:23 But this people hath a revolting and a</a>
<a id='line_483'>rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>5:24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our</a>
<a id='line_486'>God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season:</a>
<a id='line_487'>he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>5:25 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have</a>
<a id='line_490'>withholden good things from you.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>5:26 For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he</a>
<a id='line_493'>that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>5:27 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:</a>
<a id='line_496'>therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>5:28 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of</a>
<a id='line_499'>the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet</a>
<a id='line_500'>they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>5:29 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my</a>
<a id='line_503'>soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  5:30 A wonderful and</a>
<a id='line_504'>horrible thing is committed in the land; 5:31 The prophets prophesy</a>
<a id='line_505'>falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love</a>
<a id='line_506'>to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?  6:1 O ye</a>
<a id='line_507'>children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of</a>
<a id='line_508'>Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in</a>
<a id='line_509'>Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great</a>
<a id='line_510'>destruction.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>6:2 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate</a>

<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>6:3 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall</a>

<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>6:4 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe</a>
<a id='line_520'>unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are</a>
<a id='line_521'>stretched out.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>6:5 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>6:6 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast</a>
<a id='line_526'>a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is</a>
<a id='line_527'>wholly oppression in the midst of her.</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>6:7 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her</a>
<a id='line_530'>wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually</a>

<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>6:8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee;</a>
<a id='line_534'>lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>6:9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the</a>
<a id='line_537'>remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer</a>
<a id='line_538'>into the baskets.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>6:10 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?</a>
<a id='line_541'>behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold,</a>
<a id='line_542'>the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in</a>
<a id='line_543'>it.</a>
<a id='line_544'></a>
<a id='line_545'>6:11 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with</a>
<a id='line_546'>holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the</a>
<a id='line_547'>assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife</a>
<a id='line_548'>shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>6:12 And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields</a>
<a id='line_551'>and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the</a>
<a id='line_552'>inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>6:13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every</a>
<a id='line_555'>one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the</a>
<a id='line_556'>priest every one dealeth falsely.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>6:14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people</a>
<a id='line_559'>slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>6:15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they</a>
<a id='line_562'>were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they</a>
<a id='line_563'>shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they</a>
<a id='line_564'>shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>6:16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for</a>
<a id='line_567'>the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_568'>find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>6:17 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_571'>trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</a>

<a id='line_573'>6:18 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is</a>
<a id='line_574'>among them.</a>
<a id='line_575'></a>
<a id='line_576'>6:19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even</a>

<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>6:20 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the</a>
<a id='line_581'>sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not</a>
<a id='line_582'>acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>6:21 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks</a>

<a id='line_588'>6:22 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north</a>

<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>6:23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no</a>

<a id='line_594'>set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>6:24 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish</a>
<a id='line_597'>hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</a>

<a id='line_599'>6:25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword</a>

<a id='line_645'>7:12 But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my</a>

<a id='line_672'>upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the</a>
<a id='line_673'>field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall</a>

<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>7:21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt</a>
<a id='line_677'>offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</a>
<a id='line_678'></a>
<a id='line_679'>7:22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day</a>
<a id='line_680'>that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt</a>
<a id='line_681'>offerings or sacrifices: 7:23 But this thing commanded I them, saying,</a>
<a id='line_682'>Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and</a>
<a id='line_683'>walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well</a>

<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>7:24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the</a>

<a id='line_688'>backward, and not forward.</a>
<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>7:25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of</a>

<a id='line_692'>prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 7:26 Yet they</a>
<a id='line_693'>hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their</a>

<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>7:27 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they</a>

<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>7:28 But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not</a>

<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>7:29 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a</a>

<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>7:30 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the</a>

<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>7:31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the</a>
<a id='line_713'>valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in</a>
<a id='line_714'>the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</a>
<a id='line_715'></a>
<a id='line_716'>7:32 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall</a>
<a id='line_717'>no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the</a>

<a id='line_721'>7:33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of</a>

<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>7:34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the</a>
<a id='line_726'>streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness,</a>
<a id='line_727'>the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land</a>

<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>8:1 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of</a>

<a id='line_733'>inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: 8:2 And they shall</a>
<a id='line_734'>spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_735'>whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they</a>
<a id='line_736'>have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped:</a>
<a id='line_737'>they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon</a>
<a id='line_738'>the face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>8:3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of</a>

<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>8:4 Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they</a>
<a id='line_745'>fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?  8:5 Why then</a>
<a id='line_746'>is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?</a>
<a id='line_747'>they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>8:6 I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented</a>
<a id='line_750'>him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to</a>
<a id='line_751'>his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>8:7 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the</a>

<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>8:8 How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?</a>
<a id='line_758'>Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>8:9 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they</a>
<a id='line_761'>have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?  8:10</a>
<a id='line_762'>Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to</a>
<a id='line_763'>them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto</a>
<a id='line_764'>the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the</a>
<a id='line_765'>priest every one dealeth falsely.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>8:11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people</a>
<a id='line_768'>slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>8:12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they</a>
<a id='line_771'>were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall</a>
<a id='line_772'>they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they</a>
<a id='line_773'>shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>8:13 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no</a>
<a id='line_776'>grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade;</a>
<a id='line_777'>and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>8:14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into</a>
<a id='line_780'>the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God</a>
<a id='line_781'>hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because</a>
<a id='line_782'>we have sinned against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>8:15 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health,</a>
<a id='line_785'>and behold trouble!  8:16 The snorting of his horses was heard from</a>
<a id='line_786'>Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his</a>
<a id='line_787'>strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all</a>
<a id='line_788'>that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'>8:17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which</a>
<a id='line_791'>will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>8:18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in</a>
<a id='line_794'>me.</a>
<a id='line_795'></a>
<a id='line_796'>8:19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because</a>
<a id='line_797'>of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not</a>
<a id='line_798'>her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven</a>
<a id='line_799'>images, and with strange vanities?  8:20 The harvest is past, the</a>
<a id='line_800'>summer is ended, and we are not saved.</a>
<a id='line_801'></a>
<a id='line_802'>8:21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;</a>
<a id='line_803'>astonishment hath taken hold on me.</a>
<a id='line_804'></a>
<a id='line_805'>8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then</a>
<a id='line_806'>is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?  9:1 Oh that</a>
<a id='line_807'>my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might</a>
<a id='line_808'>weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!  9:2 Oh</a>
<a id='line_809'>that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I</a>
<a id='line_810'>might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers,</a>
<a id='line_811'>an assembly of treacherous men.</a>
<a id='line_812'></a>
<a id='line_813'>9:3 And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are</a>
<a id='line_814'>not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil</a>
<a id='line_815'>to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>9:4 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any</a>
<a id='line_818'>brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour</a>
<a id='line_819'>will walk with slanders.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>9:5 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak</a>
<a id='line_822'>the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary</a>
<a id='line_823'>themselves to commit iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_824'></a>
<a id='line_825'>9:6 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they</a>
<a id='line_826'>refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>9:7 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them,</a>
<a id='line_829'>and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?  9:8</a>
<a id='line_830'>Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh</a>
<a id='line_831'>peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his</a>
<a id='line_832'>wait.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>9:9 Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not</a>
<a id='line_835'>my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  9:10 For the mountains</a>
<a id='line_836'>will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the</a>
<a id='line_837'>wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can</a>
<a id='line_838'>pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both</a>
<a id='line_839'>the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.</a>
<a id='line_840'></a>
<a id='line_841'>9:11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will</a>
<a id='line_842'>make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</a>
<a id='line_843'></a>
<a id='line_844'>9:12 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to</a>
<a id='line_845'>whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for</a>
<a id='line_846'>what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none</a>
<a id='line_847'>passeth through?  9:13 And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken</a>
<a id='line_848'>my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither</a>
<a id='line_849'>walked therein; 9:14 But have walked after the imagination of their</a>
<a id='line_850'>own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them: 9:15</a>
<a id='line_851'>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I</a>
<a id='line_852'>will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water</a>
<a id='line_853'>of gall to drink.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>9:16 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor</a>
<a id='line_856'>their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I</a>
<a id='line_857'>have consumed them.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>9:17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the</a>
<a id='line_860'>mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that</a>
<a id='line_861'>they may come: 9:18 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for</a>
<a id='line_862'>us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out</a>
<a id='line_863'>with waters.</a>
<a id='line_864'></a>
<a id='line_865'>9:19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled!</a>
<a id='line_866'>we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because</a>
<a id='line_867'>our dwellings have cast us out.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>9:20 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear</a>

<a id='line_871'>every one her neighbour lamentation.</a>
<a id='line_872'></a>
<a id='line_873'>9:21 For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our</a>

<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>9:22 Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall</a>

<a id='line_880'></a>
<a id='line_881'>9:23 Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,</a>

<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>10:17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the</a>

<a id='line_958'></a>
<a id='line_959'>10:19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly</a>

<a id='line_961'></a>
<a id='line_962'>10:20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my</a>

<a id='line_966'>10:21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the</a>

<a id='line_969'></a>
<a id='line_970'>10:22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion</a>
<a id='line_971'>out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a</a>

<a id='line_973'></a>
<a id='line_974'>10:23 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not</a>

<a id='line_977'>10:24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest</a>

<a id='line_979'></a>
<a id='line_980'>10:25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon</a>
<a id='line_981'>the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob,</a>

<a id='line_983'>desolate.</a>
<a id='line_984'></a>
<a id='line_985'>11:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying, 11:2 Hear ye</a>
<a id='line_986'>the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to</a>
<a id='line_987'>the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 11:3 And say thou unto them, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_988'>the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words</a>
<a id='line_989'>of this covenant, 11:4 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that</a>
<a id='line_990'>I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace,</a>
<a id='line_991'>saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command</a>
<a id='line_992'>you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: 11:5 That I may</a>
<a id='line_993'>perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a</a>
<a id='line_994'>land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I,</a>
<a id='line_995'>and said, So be it, O LORD.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>11:6 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the</a>
<a id='line_998'>cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the</a>
<a id='line_999'>words of this covenant, and do them.</a>
<a id='line_1000'></a>
<a id='line_1001'>11:7 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I</a>
<a id='line_1002'>brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising</a>
<a id='line_1003'>early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</a>
<a id='line_1004'></a>
<a id='line_1005'>11:8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one</a>
<a id='line_1006'>in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon</a>
<a id='line_1007'>them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but</a>
<a id='line_1008'>they did them not.</a>
<a id='line_1009'></a>
<a id='line_1010'>11:9 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of</a>
<a id='line_1011'>Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1012'></a>
<a id='line_1013'>11:10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to</a>
<a id='line_1015'>serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my</a>
<a id='line_1016'>covenant which I made with their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>11:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon</a>
<a id='line_1019'>them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall</a>
<a id='line_1020'>cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>11:12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not</a>
<a id='line_1024'>save them at all in the time of their trouble.</a>
<a id='line_1025'></a>
<a id='line_1026'>11:13 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O</a>
<a id='line_1027'>Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye</a>
<a id='line_1028'>set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto</a>
<a id='line_1029'>Baal.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>11:14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry</a>

<a id='line_1034'></a>
<a id='line_1035'>11:15 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath</a>
<a id='line_1036'>wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee?</a>
<a id='line_1037'>when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</a>
<a id='line_1038'></a>
<a id='line_1039'>11:16 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of</a>
<a id='line_1040'>goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire</a>
<a id='line_1041'>upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>11:17 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil</a>
<a id='line_1044'>against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger</a>
<a id='line_1046'>in offering incense unto Baal.</a>
<a id='line_1047'></a>
<a id='line_1048'>11:18 And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then</a>

<a id='line_1051'>11:19 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter;</a>
<a id='line_1052'>and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let</a>

<a id='line_1054'>from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</a>
<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>11:20 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the</a>
<a id='line_1057'>reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee</a>

<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>11:21 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek</a>
<a id='line_1061'>thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die</a>
<a id='line_1062'>not by our hand: 11:22 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons</a>
<a id='line_1064'>and their daughters shall die by famine: 11:23 And there shall be no</a>
<a id='line_1065'>remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even</a>
<a id='line_1066'>the year of their visitation.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>12:1 Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me</a>
<a id='line_1069'>talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked</a>
<a id='line_1070'>prosper?  wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</a>
<a id='line_1071'>12:2 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far</a>
<a id='line_1073'>from their reins.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>12:3 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine</a>
<a id='line_1076'>heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and</a>
<a id='line_1077'>prepare them for the day of slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>12:4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field</a>
<a id='line_1080'>wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are</a>
<a id='line_1081'>consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last</a>

<a id='line_1083'></a>
<a id='line_1084'>12:5 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,</a>
<a id='line_1085'>then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace,</a>
<a id='line_1086'>wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in</a>
<a id='line_1087'>the swelling of Jordan?  12:6 For even thy brethren, and the house of</a>
<a id='line_1088'>thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they</a>
<a id='line_1089'>have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they</a>

<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>12:7 I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have</a>

<a id='line_1095'>12:8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out</a>

<a id='line_1100'>come to devour.</a>
<a id='line_1101'></a>
<a id='line_1102'>12:10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my</a>

<a id='line_1104'>wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1105'></a>
<a id='line_1106'>12:11 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto</a>
<a id='line_1107'>me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to</a>

<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>12:12 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the</a>

<a id='line_1112'>the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</a>
<a id='line_1113'></a>
<a id='line_1114'>12:13 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put</a>
<a id='line_1115'>themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of</a>
<a id='line_1116'>your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>12:14 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch</a>
<a id='line_1119'>the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit;</a>
<a id='line_1120'>Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house</a>
<a id='line_1121'>of Judah from among them.</a>
<a id='line_1122'></a>
<a id='line_1123'>12:15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I</a>
<a id='line_1124'>will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>12:16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the</a>
<a id='line_1128'>ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they</a>
<a id='line_1129'>taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the</a>
<a id='line_1130'>midst of my people.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>12:17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy</a>
<a id='line_1133'>that nation, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1134'></a>
<a id='line_1135'>13:1 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and</a>
<a id='line_1136'>put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.</a>
<a id='line_1137'></a>
<a id='line_1138'>13:2 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it</a>
<a id='line_1139'>on my loins.</a>
<a id='line_1140'></a>
<a id='line_1141'>13:3 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>13:4 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and</a>
<a id='line_1143'>arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</a>
<a id='line_1144'></a>
<a id='line_1145'>13:5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>13:6 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,</a>
<a id='line_1148'>Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I</a>
<a id='line_1149'>commanded thee to hide there.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>13:7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from</a>
<a id='line_1152'>the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it</a>
<a id='line_1153'>was profitable for nothing.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>13:8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:9 Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_1156'>the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the</a>
<a id='line_1157'>great pride of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1158'></a>
<a id='line_1159'>13:10 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in</a>
<a id='line_1160'>the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve</a>
<a id='line_1161'>them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good</a>
<a id='line_1162'>for nothing.</a>
<a id='line_1163'></a>
<a id='line_1164'>13:11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I</a>
<a id='line_1165'>caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house</a>
<a id='line_1166'>of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and</a>
<a id='line_1167'>for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not</a>
<a id='line_1168'>hear.</a>
<a id='line_1169'></a>
<a id='line_1170'>13:12 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they</a>
<a id='line_1172'>shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall</a>
<a id='line_1173'>be filled with wine?  13:13 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_1174'>the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even</a>
<a id='line_1175'>the kings that sit upon Davidâ€™s throne, and the priests, and the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</a>
<a id='line_1177'></a>
<a id='line_1178'>13:14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and</a>
<a id='line_1179'>the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor</a>
<a id='line_1180'>have mercy, but destroy them.</a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>13:15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>13:16 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and</a>
<a id='line_1185'>before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look</a>
<a id='line_1186'>for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross</a>
<a id='line_1187'>darkness.</a>
<a id='line_1188'></a>
<a id='line_1189'>13:17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places</a>
<a id='line_1190'>for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears,</a>
<a id='line_1191'>because the LORDâ€™s flock is carried away captive.</a>
<a id='line_1192'></a>
<a id='line_1193'>13:18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:</a>
<a id='line_1194'>for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.</a>
<a id='line_1195'></a>
<a id='line_1196'>13:19 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open</a>
<a id='line_1197'>them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be</a>
<a id='line_1198'>wholly carried away captive.</a>
<a id='line_1199'></a>
<a id='line_1200'>13:20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:</a>
<a id='line_1201'>where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?  13:21</a>
<a id='line_1202'>What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught</a>
<a id='line_1203'>them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take</a>
<a id='line_1204'>thee, as a woman in travail?  13:22 And if thou say in thine heart,</a>
<a id='line_1205'>Wherefore come these things upon me?  For the greatness of thine</a>
<a id='line_1206'>iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.</a>
<a id='line_1207'></a>
<a id='line_1208'>13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?</a>
<a id='line_1209'>then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</a>
<a id='line_1210'></a>
<a id='line_1211'>13:24 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away</a>
<a id='line_1212'>by the wind of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>13:25 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the</a>
<a id='line_1215'>LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</a>
<a id='line_1216'></a>
<a id='line_1217'>13:26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy</a>
<a id='line_1218'>shame may appear.</a>
<a id='line_1219'></a>
<a id='line_1220'>13:27 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of</a>
<a id='line_1221'>thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe</a>
<a id='line_1222'>unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it</a>

<a id='line_1229'>14:3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they</a>

<a id='line_1233'>14:4 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth,</a>

<a id='line_1236'>14:5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because</a>

<a id='line_1257'></a>
<a id='line_1258'>14:11 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their</a>

<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>14:12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer</a>
<a id='line_1262'>burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will</a>

<a id='line_1264'></a>
<a id='line_1265'>14:13 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,</a>

<a id='line_1269'>14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my</a>

<a id='line_1278'></a>
<a id='line_1279'>14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the</a>

<a id='line_1297'>trouble!  14:20 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the</a>

<a id='line_1322'>15:4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the</a>

<a id='line_1427'>have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and</a>
<a id='line_1428'>have not kept my law; 16:12 And ye have done worse than your fathers;</a>
<a id='line_1429'>for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil</a>
<a id='line_1430'>heart, that they may not hearken unto me: 16:13 Therefore will I cast</a>

<a id='line_1554'>and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_1555'>on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof,</a>

<a id='line_1559'>18:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 18:2</a>

<a id='line_1562'></a>
<a id='line_1563'>18:3 Then I went down to the potterâ€™s house, and, behold, he wrought a</a>

<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18:6 O house of</a>

<a id='line_1585'>18:11 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the</a>
<a id='line_1586'>inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame</a>
<a id='line_1587'>evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every</a>

<a id='line_1590'>18:12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own</a>

<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>18:14 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock</a>

<a id='line_1600'>have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in</a>
<a id='line_1601'>their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast</a>

<a id='line_1608'></a>
<a id='line_1609'>18:18 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;</a>

<a id='line_1613'></a>
<a id='line_1614'>18:19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that</a>

<a id='line_1620'></a>
<a id='line_1621'>18:21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out</a>

<a id='line_1638'>is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I</a>
<a id='line_1639'>shall tell thee, 19:3 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings</a>
<a id='line_1640'>of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the</a>
<a id='line_1642'>which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>19:4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and</a>

<a id='line_1647'>with the blood of innocents; 19:5 They have built also the high places</a>
<a id='line_1648'>of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal,</a>
<a id='line_1649'>which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:</a>

<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>19:8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one</a>

<a id='line_1663'></a>
<a id='line_1664'>19:9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the</a>

<a id='line_1666'>his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and</a>
<a id='line_1667'>they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.</a>
<a id='line_1668'></a>
<a id='line_1669'>19:10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go</a>
<a id='line_1670'>with thee, 19:11 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_1671'>hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh</a>
<a id='line_1672'>a potterâ€™s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall</a>
<a id='line_1673'>bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>19:12 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the</a>
<a id='line_1676'>inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet: 19:13 And the</a>
<a id='line_1677'>houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be</a>
<a id='line_1678'>defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose</a>
<a id='line_1679'>roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have</a>
<a id='line_1680'>poured out drink offerings unto other gods.</a>
<a id='line_1681'></a>
<a id='line_1682'>19:14 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to</a>
<a id='line_1683'>prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORDâ€™s house; and said to</a>
<a id='line_1684'>all the people, 19:15 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;</a>
<a id='line_1685'>Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the</a>
<a id='line_1686'>evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened</a>
<a id='line_1687'>their necks, that they might not hear my words.</a>
<a id='line_1688'></a>
<a id='line_1689'>20:1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief</a>
<a id='line_1690'>governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied</a>
<a id='line_1691'>these things.</a>
<a id='line_1692'></a>
<a id='line_1693'>20:2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks</a>
<a id='line_1694'>that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the</a>
<a id='line_1695'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1696'></a>
<a id='line_1697'>20:3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth</a>
<a id='line_1698'>Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_1699'>not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.</a>
<a id='line_1700'></a>
<a id='line_1701'>20:4 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to</a>
<a id='line_1702'>thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of</a>
<a id='line_1703'>their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all</a>
<a id='line_1704'>Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them</a>
<a id='line_1705'>captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_1706'></a>
<a id='line_1707'>20:5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all</a>
<a id='line_1708'>the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the</a>
<a id='line_1709'>treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their</a>
<a id='line_1710'>enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to</a>
<a id='line_1711'>Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_1712'></a>
<a id='line_1713'>20:6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into</a>
<a id='line_1714'>captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die,</a>
<a id='line_1715'>and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou</a>
<a id='line_1716'>hast prophesied lies.</a>
<a id='line_1717'></a>
<a id='line_1718'>20:7 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art</a>
<a id='line_1719'>stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one</a>
<a id='line_1720'>mocketh me.</a>
<a id='line_1721'></a>
<a id='line_1722'>20:8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;</a>
<a id='line_1723'>because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a</a>
<a id='line_1724'>derision, daily.</a>
<a id='line_1725'></a>
<a id='line_1726'>20:9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more</a>
<a id='line_1727'>in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up</a>
<a id='line_1728'>in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.</a>
<a id='line_1729'></a>
<a id='line_1730'>20:10 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my</a>
<a id='line_1732'>halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail</a>
<a id='line_1733'>against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</a>
<a id='line_1734'></a>
<a id='line_1735'>20:11 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my</a>
<a id='line_1736'>persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be</a>
<a id='line_1737'>greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting</a>
<a id='line_1738'>confusion shall never be forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_1739'></a>
<a id='line_1740'>20:12 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the</a>

<a id='line_1743'></a>
<a id='line_1744'>20:13 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered</a>

<a id='line_1746'></a>
<a id='line_1747'>20:14 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my</a>

<a id='line_1752'></a>
<a id='line_1753'>20:16 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and</a>
<a id='line_1754'>repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the</a>
<a id='line_1755'>shouting at noontide; 20:17 Because he slew me not from the womb; or</a>
<a id='line_1756'>that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always</a>
<a id='line_1757'>great with me.</a>
<a id='line_1758'></a>
<a id='line_1759'>20:18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>that my days should be consumed with shame?  21:1 The word which came</a>
<a id='line_1761'>unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur</a>
<a id='line_1762'>the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest,</a>
<a id='line_1763'>saying, 21:2 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for</a>
<a id='line_1764'>Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that</a>
<a id='line_1765'>the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that</a>
<a id='line_1766'>he may go up from us.</a>
<a id='line_1767'></a>
<a id='line_1768'>21:3 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 21:4</a>

<a id='line_1773'></a>
<a id='line_1774'>21:5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and</a>

<a id='line_1777'>21:6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and</a>
<a id='line_1778'>beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>

<a id='line_1782'>city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into</a>
<a id='line_1783'>the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their</a>
<a id='line_1784'>enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall</a>
<a id='line_1785'>smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them,</a>
<a id='line_1786'>neither have pity, nor have mercy.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>21:8 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,</a>

<a id='line_1790'></a>
<a id='line_1791'>21:9 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the</a>

<a id='line_1796'>21:10 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for</a>

<a id='line_1800'>21:11 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the</a>

<a id='line_1809'>you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will</a>

<a id='line_1817'>the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the</a>
<a id='line_1818'>spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no</a>
<a id='line_1819'>violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed</a>

<a id='line_1836'></a>
<a id='line_1837'>22:8 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say</a>

<a id='line_2004'>dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers</a>

<a id='line_2027'></a>
<a id='line_2028'>23:34 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that</a>

<a id='line_2032'>23:35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to</a>

<a id='line_2035'>for every manâ€™s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the</a>
<a id='line_2036'>words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.</a>

<a id='line_2038'>23:37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered</a>

<a id='line_2041'>word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye</a>
<a id='line_2042'>shall not say, The burden of the LORD; 23:39 Therefore, behold, I,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city</a>
<a id='line_2044'>that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:</a>
<a id='line_2045'>23:40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a</a>

<a id='line_2047'></a>
<a id='line_2048'>24:1 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set</a>
<a id='line_2049'>before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of</a>

<a id='line_2051'>Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from</a>

<a id='line_2057'></a>
<a id='line_2058'>24:3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I</a>

<a id='line_2061'></a>
<a id='line_2062'>24:4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5 Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_2063'>the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I</a>

<a id='line_2065'>sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.</a>
<a id='line_2066'></a>
<a id='line_2067'>24:6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring</a>

<a id='line_2070'></a>
<a id='line_2071'>24:7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and</a>

<a id='line_2074'></a>
<a id='line_2075'>24:8 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;</a>
<a id='line_2076'>surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah,</a>

<a id='line_2078'>land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 24:9 And I will</a>
<a id='line_2079'>deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for</a>
<a id='line_2080'>their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in</a>

<a id='line_2093'>three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and</a>
<a id='line_2094'>I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not</a>

<a id='line_2096'></a>
<a id='line_2097'>25:4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,</a>

<a id='line_2100'></a>
<a id='line_2101'>25:5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and</a>

<a id='line_2103'>given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 25:6 And go not</a>
<a id='line_2104'>after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me</a>
<a id='line_2105'>not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.</a>
<a id='line_2106'></a>
<a id='line_2107'>25:7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might</a>

<a id='line_2110'>25:8 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard</a>

<a id='line_2142'>25:16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the</a>
<a id='line_2143'>sword that I will send among them.</a>
<a id='line_2144'></a>
<a id='line_2145'>25:17 Then took I the cup at the LORDâ€™s hand, and made all the nations</a>
<a id='line_2146'>to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 25:18 To wit, Jerusalem, and</a>
<a id='line_2147'>the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof,</a>
<a id='line_2148'>to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse;</a>
<a id='line_2149'>as it is this day; 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and</a>
<a id='line_2150'>his princes, and all his people; 25:20 And all the mingled people, and</a>
<a id='line_2151'>all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the</a>

<a id='line_2156'>all that are in the utmost corners, 25:24 And all the kings of Arabia,</a>
<a id='line_2157'>and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,</a>

<a id='line_2160'>near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are</a>
<a id='line_2161'>upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after</a>
<a id='line_2162'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>25:27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_2165'>hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and</a>
<a id='line_2166'>fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among</a>
<a id='line_2167'>you.</a>
<a id='line_2168'></a>
<a id='line_2169'>25:28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to</a>
<a id='line_2170'>drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye</a>
<a id='line_2171'>shall certainly drink.</a>
<a id='line_2172'></a>
<a id='line_2173'>25:29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my</a>
<a id='line_2174'>name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished:</a>
<a id='line_2175'>for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth,</a>
<a id='line_2176'>saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_2177'></a>
<a id='line_2178'>25:30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say</a>
<a id='line_2179'>unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from</a>
<a id='line_2180'>his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he</a>
<a id='line_2181'>shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the</a>
<a id='line_2182'>inhabitants of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2183'></a>
<a id='line_2184'>25:31 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD</a>

<a id='line_2186'>will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2187'></a>
<a id='line_2188'>25:32 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from</a>

<a id='line_2192'>25:33 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of</a>

<a id='line_2195'>ground.</a>
<a id='line_2196'></a>
<a id='line_2197'>25:34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,</a>
<a id='line_2198'>ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your</a>
<a id='line_2199'>dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant</a>
<a id='line_2200'>vessel.</a>
<a id='line_2201'></a>
<a id='line_2202'>25:35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal</a>

<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>25:36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the</a>
<a id='line_2206'>principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled</a>

<a id='line_2208'></a>
<a id='line_2209'>25:37 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce</a>

<a id='line_2211'></a>
<a id='line_2212'>25:38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is</a>
<a id='line_2213'>desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of</a>
<a id='line_2214'>his fierce anger.</a>
<a id='line_2215'></a>
<a id='line_2216'>26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king</a>
<a id='line_2217'>of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying, 26:2 Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_2218'>LORD; Stand in the court of the LORDâ€™s house, and speak unto all the</a>
<a id='line_2219'>cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORDâ€™s house, all the</a>
<a id='line_2220'>words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</a>
<a id='line_2221'>26:3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,</a>
<a id='line_2222'>that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them</a>
<a id='line_2223'>because of the evil of their doings.</a>
<a id='line_2224'></a>
<a id='line_2225'>26:4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not</a>
<a id='line_2226'>hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, 26:5 To</a>
<a id='line_2227'>hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto</a>
<a id='line_2228'>you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not</a>
<a id='line_2229'>hearkened; 26:6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make</a>
<a id='line_2230'>this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2231'></a>
<a id='line_2232'>26:7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah</a>
<a id='line_2233'>speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>26:8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking</a>
<a id='line_2236'>all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that</a>
<a id='line_2237'>the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou</a>
<a id='line_2238'>shalt surely die.</a>
<a id='line_2239'></a>
<a id='line_2240'>26:9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This</a>
<a id='line_2241'>house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an</a>
<a id='line_2242'>inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the</a>
<a id='line_2243'>house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2244'></a>
<a id='line_2245'>26:10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up</a>
<a id='line_2246'>from the kingâ€™s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the</a>
<a id='line_2247'>entry of the new gate of the LORDâ€™s house.</a>
<a id='line_2248'></a>
<a id='line_2249'>26:11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to</a>
<a id='line_2250'>all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath</a>
<a id='line_2251'>prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</a>
<a id='line_2252'></a>
<a id='line_2253'>26:12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,</a>
<a id='line_2254'>saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against</a>
<a id='line_2255'>this city all the words that ye have heard.</a>
<a id='line_2256'></a>
<a id='line_2257'>26:13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the</a>
<a id='line_2258'>voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil</a>
<a id='line_2259'>that he hath pronounced against you.</a>
<a id='line_2260'></a>
<a id='line_2261'>26:14 As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good</a>
<a id='line_2262'>and meet unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2263'></a>
<a id='line_2264'>26:15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2265'>surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and</a>
<a id='line_2266'>upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me</a>
<a id='line_2267'>unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</a>
<a id='line_2268'></a>
<a id='line_2269'>26:16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to</a>
<a id='line_2270'>the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us</a>
<a id='line_2271'>in the name of the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_2272'></a>
<a id='line_2273'>26:17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all</a>
<a id='line_2274'>the assembly of the people, saying, 26:18 Micah the Morasthite</a>
<a id='line_2275'>prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the</a>
<a id='line_2276'>people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be</a>
<a id='line_2277'>plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the</a>
<a id='line_2278'>mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</a>
<a id='line_2279'></a>
<a id='line_2280'>26:19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to</a>
<a id='line_2281'>death?  did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2282'>repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus</a>
<a id='line_2283'>might we procure great evil against our souls.</a>
<a id='line_2284'></a>
<a id='line_2285'>26:20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2286'>LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied</a>
<a id='line_2287'>against this city and against this land according to all the words of</a>
<a id='line_2288'>Jeremiah.</a>
<a id='line_2289'></a>
<a id='line_2290'>26:21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all</a>
<a id='line_2291'>the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but</a>
<a id='line_2292'>when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</a>
<a id='line_2293'>26:22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the</a>
<a id='line_2294'>son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_2295'></a>
<a id='line_2296'>26:23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto</a>
<a id='line_2297'>Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead</a>
<a id='line_2298'>body into the graves of the common people.</a>
<a id='line_2299'></a>
<a id='line_2300'>26:24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with</a>
<a id='line_2301'>Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to</a>
<a id='line_2302'>put him to death.</a>
<a id='line_2303'></a>
<a id='line_2304'>27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king</a>
<a id='line_2305'>of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 27:2 Thus</a>
<a id='line_2306'>saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy</a>
<a id='line_2307'>neck, 27:3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,</a>
<a id='line_2308'>and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the</a>
<a id='line_2309'>king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_2310'>unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 27:4 And command them to say unto their</a>
<a id='line_2311'>masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall</a>
<a id='line_2312'>ye say unto your masters; 27:5 I have made the earth, the man and the</a>
<a id='line_2313'>beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my</a>
<a id='line_2314'>outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</a>
<a id='line_2315'></a>
<a id='line_2316'>27:6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_2317'>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the</a>
<a id='line_2318'>field have I given him also to serve him.</a>
<a id='line_2319'></a>
<a id='line_2320'>27:7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his sonâ€™s son,</a>
<a id='line_2321'>until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great</a>
<a id='line_2322'>kings shall serve themselves of him.</a>
<a id='line_2323'></a>
<a id='line_2324'>27:8 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will</a>
<a id='line_2325'>not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will</a>
<a id='line_2326'>not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation</a>
<a id='line_2327'>will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine,</a>
<a id='line_2328'>and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2329'></a>
<a id='line_2330'>27:9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,</a>
<a id='line_2331'>nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers,</a>
<a id='line_2332'>which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</a>
<a id='line_2333'>27:10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your</a>
<a id='line_2334'>land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</a>
<a id='line_2335'></a>
<a id='line_2336'>27:11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king</a>
<a id='line_2337'>of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own</a>
<a id='line_2338'>land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_2339'></a>
<a id='line_2340'>27:12 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these</a>
<a id='line_2341'>words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,</a>
<a id='line_2342'>and serve him and his people, and live.</a>
<a id='line_2343'></a>
<a id='line_2344'>27:13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the</a>
<a id='line_2345'>famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the</a>
<a id='line_2346'>nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?  27:14 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_2347'>hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you,</a>
<a id='line_2348'>saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a</a>
<a id='line_2349'>lie unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2350'></a>
<a id='line_2351'>27:15 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a</a>
<a id='line_2352'>lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish,</a>
<a id='line_2353'>ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2354'></a>
<a id='line_2355'>27:16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus</a>
<a id='line_2356'>saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that</a>
<a id='line_2357'>prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORDâ€™s house</a>
<a id='line_2358'>shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a</a>
<a id='line_2359'>lie unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2360'></a>
<a id='line_2361'>27:17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:</a>
<a id='line_2362'>wherefore should this city be laid waste?  27:18 But if they be</a>
<a id='line_2363'>prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make</a>
<a id='line_2364'>intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in</a>
<a id='line_2365'>the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at</a>
<a id='line_2366'>Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_2367'></a>
<a id='line_2368'>27:19 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and</a>
<a id='line_2369'>concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the</a>
<a id='line_2370'>residue of the vessels that remain in this city.</a>
<a id='line_2371'></a>
<a id='line_2372'>27:20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried</a>
<a id='line_2373'>away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from</a>
<a id='line_2374'>Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 27:21</a>
<a id='line_2375'>Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the</a>
<a id='line_2376'>vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the</a>
<a id='line_2377'>king of Judah and of Jerusalem; 27:22 They shall be carried to</a>
<a id='line_2378'>Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them,</a>
<a id='line_2379'>saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this</a>
<a id='line_2380'>place.</a>
<a id='line_2381'></a>
<a id='line_2382'>28:1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign</a>
<a id='line_2383'>of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month,</a>
<a id='line_2384'>that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake</a>
<a id='line_2385'>unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and</a>
<a id='line_2386'>of all the people, saying, 28:2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the</a>
<a id='line_2387'>God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_2388'></a>
<a id='line_2389'>28:3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the</a>
<a id='line_2390'>vessels of the LORDâ€™s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took</a>
<a id='line_2391'>away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: 28:4 And I will</a>
<a id='line_2392'>bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the</a>
<a id='line_2394'>LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_2395'></a>
<a id='line_2396'>28:5 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the</a>
<a id='line_2397'>presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that</a>
<a id='line_2398'>stood in the house of the LORD, 28:6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said,</a>
<a id='line_2399'>Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2400'>prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORDâ€™s house, and all</a>
<a id='line_2401'>that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</a>
<a id='line_2402'></a>
<a id='line_2403'>28:7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears,</a>
<a id='line_2404'>and in the ears of all the people; 28:8 The prophets that have been</a>
<a id='line_2405'>before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many</a>
<a id='line_2406'>countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of</a>
<a id='line_2407'>pestilence.</a>
<a id='line_2408'></a>
<a id='line_2409'>28:9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the</a>
<a id='line_2410'>prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the</a>
<a id='line_2411'>LORD hath truly sent him.</a>
<a id='line_2412'></a>
<a id='line_2413'>28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet</a>
<a id='line_2414'>Jeremiahâ€™s neck, and brake it.</a>
<a id='line_2415'></a>
<a id='line_2416'>28:11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2417'>Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar</a>
<a id='line_2418'>king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two</a>
<a id='line_2419'>full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</a>
<a id='line_2420'></a>
<a id='line_2421'>28:12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after</a>
<a id='line_2422'>that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the</a>
<a id='line_2423'>prophet Jeremiah, saying, 28:13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus</a>
<a id='line_2424'>saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2425'>make for them yokes of iron.</a>
<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>28:14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put</a>
<a id='line_2428'>a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve</a>
<a id='line_2429'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have</a>
<a id='line_2430'>given him the beasts of the field also.</a>
<a id='line_2431'></a>
<a id='line_2432'>28:15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear</a>
<a id='line_2433'>now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this</a>
<a id='line_2434'>people to trust in a lie.</a>
<a id='line_2435'></a>
<a id='line_2436'>28:16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off</a>
<a id='line_2437'>the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2438'>taught rebellion against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2439'></a>
<a id='line_2440'>28:17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</a>
<a id='line_2441'></a>
<a id='line_2442'>29:1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet</a>
<a id='line_2443'>sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried</a>
<a id='line_2444'>away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the</a>
<a id='line_2445'>people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to</a>
<a id='line_2446'>Babylon; 29:2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the</a>
<a id='line_2447'>eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and</a>
<a id='line_2448'>the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 29:3 By the hand of Elasah</a>
<a id='line_2449'>the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah</a>
<a id='line_2450'>king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon)</a>
<a id='line_2451'>saying, 29:4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all</a>
<a id='line_2452'>that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away</a>
<a id='line_2453'>from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 29:5 Build ye houses, and dwell in them;</a>
<a id='line_2454'>and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 29:6 Take ye wives, and</a>
<a id='line_2455'>beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your</a>
<a id='line_2456'>daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye</a>
<a id='line_2457'>may be increased there, and not diminished.</a>
<a id='line_2458'></a>
<a id='line_2459'>29:7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be</a>
<a id='line_2460'>carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace</a>
<a id='line_2461'>thereof shall ye have peace.</a>
<a id='line_2462'></a>
<a id='line_2463'>29:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your</a>
<a id='line_2464'>prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you,</a>
<a id='line_2465'>neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.</a>
<a id='line_2466'></a>
<a id='line_2467'>29:9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent</a>
<a id='line_2468'>them, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>29:10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be</a>
<a id='line_2471'>accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word</a>
<a id='line_2472'>toward you, in causing you to return to this place.</a>
<a id='line_2473'></a>
<a id='line_2474'>29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2475'>thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</a>
<a id='line_2476'></a>
<a id='line_2477'>29:12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2478'>and I will hearken unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me</a>
<a id='line_2481'>with all your heart.</a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'>29:14 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away</a>
<a id='line_2484'>your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from</a>
<a id='line_2485'>all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will</a>
<a id='line_2486'>bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away</a>
<a id='line_2487'>captive.</a>
<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>29:15 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in</a>
<a id='line_2490'>Babylon; 29:16 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth</a>
<a id='line_2491'>upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this</a>
<a id='line_2492'>city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into</a>
<a id='line_2493'>captivity; 29:17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send</a>
<a id='line_2494'>upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make</a>
<a id='line_2495'>them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</a>
<a id='line_2496'></a>
<a id='line_2497'>29:18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and</a>
<a id='line_2498'>with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the</a>
<a id='line_2499'>kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an</a>
<a id='line_2500'>hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven</a>
<a id='line_2501'>them: 29:19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the</a>
<a id='line_2502'>LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up</a>
<a id='line_2503'>early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2504'></a>
<a id='line_2505'>29:20 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,</a>
<a id='line_2506'>whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 29:21 Thus saith the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2507'>of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of</a>
<a id='line_2508'>Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my</a>
<a id='line_2509'>name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king</a>
<a id='line_2510'>of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 29:22 And of them</a>
<a id='line_2511'>shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in</a>
<a id='line_2512'>Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom</a>
<a id='line_2513'>the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 29:23 Because they have</a>
<a id='line_2514'>committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their</a>
<a id='line_2515'>neighboursâ€™ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I</a>
<a id='line_2516'>have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the</a>
<a id='line_2517'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2518'></a>
<a id='line_2519'>29:24 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2520'>29:25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2521'>Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that</a>
<a id='line_2522'>are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and</a>
<a id='line_2523'>to all the priests, saying, 29:26 The LORD hath made thee priest in</a>
<a id='line_2524'>the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the</a>
<a id='line_2525'>house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a</a>
<a id='line_2526'>prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</a>
<a id='line_2527'></a>
<a id='line_2528'>29:27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>which maketh himself a prophet to you?  29:28 For therefore he sent</a>
<a id='line_2530'>unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses,</a>
<a id='line_2531'>and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</a>
<a id='line_2532'></a>
<a id='line_2533'>29:29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of</a>
<a id='line_2534'>Jeremiah the prophet.</a>
<a id='line_2535'></a>
<a id='line_2536'>29:30 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 29:31 Send</a>
<a id='line_2537'>to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning</a>
<a id='line_2538'>Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto</a>
<a id='line_2539'>you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 29:32</a>
<a id='line_2540'>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the</a>
<a id='line_2541'>Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this</a>
<a id='line_2542'>people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people,</a>
<a id='line_2543'>saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2544'></a>
<a id='line_2545'>30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 30:2 Thus</a>
<a id='line_2546'>speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that</a>
<a id='line_2547'>I have spoken unto thee in a book.</a>
<a id='line_2548'></a>
<a id='line_2549'>30:3 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again</a>
<a id='line_2550'>the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I</a>
<a id='line_2551'>will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers,</a>
<a id='line_2552'>and they shall possess it.</a>
<a id='line_2553'></a>
<a id='line_2554'>30:4 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and</a>
<a id='line_2555'>concerning Judah.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>30:5 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of</a>
<a id='line_2558'>fear, and not of peace.</a>
<a id='line_2559'></a>
<a id='line_2560'>30:6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?</a>
<a id='line_2561'>wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman</a>
<a id='line_2562'>in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  30:7 Alas! for</a>
<a id='line_2563'>that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of</a>
<a id='line_2564'>Jacobâ€™s trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</a>
<a id='line_2565'></a>
<a id='line_2566'>30:8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,</a>
<a id='line_2567'>that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy</a>
<a id='line_2568'>bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: 30:9 But</a>
<a id='line_2569'>they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will</a>
<a id='line_2570'>raise up unto them.</a>
<a id='line_2571'></a>
<a id='line_2572'>30:10 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_2573'>neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar,</a>
<a id='line_2574'>and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return,</a>
<a id='line_2575'>and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</a>
<a id='line_2576'></a>
<a id='line_2577'>30:11 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make</a>
<a id='line_2578'>a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will</a>
<a id='line_2579'>not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and</a>
<a id='line_2580'>will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</a>
<a id='line_2581'></a>
<a id='line_2582'>30:12 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound</a>
<a id='line_2583'>is grievous.</a>
<a id='line_2584'></a>
<a id='line_2585'>30:13 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up:</a>
<a id='line_2586'>thou hast no healing medicines.</a>
<a id='line_2587'></a>
<a id='line_2588'>30:14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I</a>
<a id='line_2589'>have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of</a>
<a id='line_2590'>a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins</a>
<a id='line_2591'>were increased.</a>
<a id='line_2592'></a>
<a id='line_2593'>30:15 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable</a>
<a id='line_2594'>for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased,</a>
<a id='line_2595'>I have done these things unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2596'></a>
<a id='line_2597'>30:16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all</a>
<a id='line_2598'>thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and</a>
<a id='line_2599'>they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee</a>
<a id='line_2600'>will I give for a prey.</a>
<a id='line_2601'></a>
<a id='line_2602'>30:17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy</a>
<a id='line_2603'>wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2604'>This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</a>
<a id='line_2605'></a>
<a id='line_2606'>30:18 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of</a>
<a id='line_2607'>Jacobâ€™s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city</a>
<a id='line_2608'>shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after</a>
<a id='line_2609'>the manner thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2610'></a>
<a id='line_2611'>30:19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them</a>
<a id='line_2612'>that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few;</a>
<a id='line_2613'>I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</a>
<a id='line_2614'></a>
<a id='line_2615'>30:20 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their</a>
<a id='line_2616'>congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all</a>
<a id='line_2617'>that oppress them.</a>
<a id='line_2618'></a>
<a id='line_2619'>30:21 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor</a>
<a id='line_2620'>shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw</a>
<a id='line_2621'>near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his</a>
<a id='line_2622'>heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2623'></a>
<a id='line_2624'>30:22 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</a>
<a id='line_2625'></a>
<a id='line_2626'>30:23 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a</a>
<a id='line_2627'>continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the</a>
<a id='line_2628'>wicked.</a>
<a id='line_2629'></a>
<a id='line_2630'>30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath</a>
<a id='line_2631'>done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the</a>
<a id='line_2632'>latter days ye shall consider it.</a>
<a id='line_2633'></a>
<a id='line_2634'>31:1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the</a>
<a id='line_2635'>families of Israel, and they shall be my people.</a>
<a id='line_2636'></a>
<a id='line_2637'>31:2 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword</a>
<a id='line_2638'>found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him</a>
<a id='line_2639'>to rest.</a>
<a id='line_2640'></a>
<a id='line_2641'>31:3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved</a>
<a id='line_2642'>thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I</a>
<a id='line_2643'>drawn thee.</a>
<a id='line_2644'></a>
<a id='line_2645'>31:4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of</a>
<a id='line_2646'>Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go</a>
<a id='line_2647'>forth in the dances of them that make merry.</a>
<a id='line_2648'></a>
<a id='line_2649'>31:5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the</a>
<a id='line_2650'>planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.</a>
<a id='line_2651'></a>
<a id='line_2652'>31:6 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount</a>
<a id='line_2653'>Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2654'>our God.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>31:7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout</a>
<a id='line_2657'>among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O</a>
<a id='line_2658'>LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>31:8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them</a>
<a id='line_2661'>from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame,</a>
<a id='line_2662'>the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a</a>
<a id='line_2663'>great company shall return thither.</a>
<a id='line_2664'></a>
<a id='line_2665'>31:9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead</a>
<a id='line_2666'>them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight</a>
<a id='line_2667'>way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_2668'>Ephraim is my firstborn.</a>
<a id='line_2669'></a>
<a id='line_2670'>31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the</a>
<a id='line_2671'>isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and</a>
<a id='line_2672'>keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.</a>
<a id='line_2673'></a>
<a id='line_2674'>31:11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand</a>
<a id='line_2675'>of him that was stronger than he.</a>
<a id='line_2676'></a>
<a id='line_2677'>31:12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and</a>
<a id='line_2678'>shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for</a>
<a id='line_2679'>wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and</a>
<a id='line_2680'>their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any</a>
<a id='line_2681'>more at all.</a>
<a id='line_2682'></a>
<a id='line_2683'>31:13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and</a>
<a id='line_2684'>old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will</a>
<a id='line_2685'>comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_2686'></a>
<a id='line_2687'>31:14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my</a>
<a id='line_2688'>people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2689'></a>
<a id='line_2690'>31:15 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,</a>
<a id='line_2691'>and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be</a>
<a id='line_2692'>comforted for her children, because they were not.</a>
<a id='line_2693'></a>
<a id='line_2694'>31:16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine</a>
<a id='line_2695'>eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and</a>
<a id='line_2696'>they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_2697'></a>
<a id='line_2698'>31:17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy</a>
<a id='line_2699'>children shall come again to their own border.</a>
<a id='line_2700'></a>
<a id='line_2701'>31:18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2702'>chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the</a>
<a id='line_2703'>yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my</a>
<a id='line_2704'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2705'></a>
<a id='line_2706'>31:19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was</a>
<a id='line_2707'>instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even</a>
<a id='line_2708'>confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</a>
<a id='line_2709'></a>
<a id='line_2710'>31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I</a>
<a id='line_2711'>spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my</a>
<a id='line_2712'>bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith</a>
<a id='line_2713'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2714'></a>
<a id='line_2715'>31:21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart</a>
<a id='line_2716'>toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O</a>
<a id='line_2717'>virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.</a>
<a id='line_2718'></a>
<a id='line_2719'>31:22 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for</a>
<a id='line_2720'>the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass</a>

<a id='line_2722'></a>
<a id='line_2723'>31:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they</a>
<a id='line_2724'>shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof,</a>
<a id='line_2725'>when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O</a>
<a id='line_2726'>habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.</a>
<a id='line_2727'></a>
<a id='line_2728'>31:24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities</a>
<a id='line_2729'>thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.</a>
<a id='line_2730'></a>
<a id='line_2731'>31:25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every</a>
<a id='line_2732'>sorrowful soul.</a>
<a id='line_2733'></a>
<a id='line_2734'>31:26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.</a>
<a id='line_2735'></a>
<a id='line_2736'>31:27 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house</a>
<a id='line_2737'>of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the</a>
<a id='line_2738'>seed of beast.</a>
<a id='line_2739'></a>
<a id='line_2740'>31:28 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over</a>
<a id='line_2741'>them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to</a>
<a id='line_2742'>destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to</a>
<a id='line_2743'>plant, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2744'></a>
<a id='line_2745'>31:29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a</a>
<a id='line_2746'>sour grape, and the childrenâ€™s teeth are set on edge.</a>
<a id='line_2747'></a>
<a id='line_2748'>31:30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that</a>
<a id='line_2749'>eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.</a>
<a id='line_2750'></a>
<a id='line_2751'>31:31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new</a>
<a id='line_2752'>covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 31:32</a>
<a id='line_2753'>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the</a>
<a id='line_2754'>day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_2755'>Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto</a>
<a id='line_2756'>them, saith the LORD: 31:33 But this shall be the covenant that I will</a>
<a id='line_2757'>make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I</a>
<a id='line_2758'>will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</a>
<a id='line_2759'>and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</a>
<a id='line_2760'></a>
<a id='line_2761'>31:34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every</a>
<a id='line_2762'>man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me,</a>
<a id='line_2763'>from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for</a>
<a id='line_2764'>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.</a>
<a id='line_2765'></a>
<a id='line_2766'>31:35 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,</a>
<a id='line_2768'>which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts</a>
<a id='line_2769'>is his name: 31:36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith</a>
<a id='line_2770'>the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation</a>
<a id='line_2771'>before me for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2772'></a>
<a id='line_2773'>31:37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the</a>
<a id='line_2774'>foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off</a>
<a id='line_2775'>all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2776'></a>
<a id='line_2777'>31:38 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be</a>
<a id='line_2778'>built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the</a>
<a id='line_2779'>corner.</a>
<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>31:39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon</a>
<a id='line_2782'>the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.</a>
<a id='line_2783'></a>
<a id='line_2784'>31:40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and</a>
<a id='line_2785'>all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse</a>
<a id='line_2786'>gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be</a>
<a id='line_2787'>plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2788'></a>
<a id='line_2789'>32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of</a>
<a id='line_2790'>Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of</a>
<a id='line_2791'>Nebuchadrezzar.</a>
<a id='line_2792'></a>
<a id='line_2793'>32:2 For then the king of Babylonâ€™s army besieged Jerusalem: and</a>
<a id='line_2794'>Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was</a>
<a id='line_2795'>in the king of Judahâ€™s house.</a>
<a id='line_2796'></a>
<a id='line_2797'>32:3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_2798'>dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give</a>
<a id='line_2799'>this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</a>
<a id='line_2800'>32:4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of</a>
<a id='line_2801'>the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king</a>
<a id='line_2802'>of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes</a>
<a id='line_2803'>shall behold his eyes; 32:5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and</a>
<a id='line_2804'>there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight</a>
<a id='line_2805'>with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.</a>
<a id='line_2806'></a>
<a id='line_2807'>32:6 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2808'>32:7 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto</a>
<a id='line_2809'>thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of</a>
<a id='line_2810'>redemption is thine to buy it.</a>
<a id='line_2811'></a>
<a id='line_2812'>32:8 So Hanameel mine uncleâ€™s son came to me in the court of the</a>
<a id='line_2813'>prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my</a>
<a id='line_2814'>field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of</a>
<a id='line_2815'>Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is</a>
<a id='line_2816'>thine; buy it for thyself.</a>
<a id='line_2817'></a>
<a id='line_2818'>Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2819'></a>
<a id='line_2820'>32:9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncleâ€™s son, that was in</a>
<a id='line_2821'>Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</a>
<a id='line_2822'></a>
<a id='line_2823'>32:10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took</a>
<a id='line_2824'>witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</a>
<a id='line_2825'></a>
<a id='line_2826'>32:11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was</a>
<a id='line_2827'>sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open: 32:12</a>
<a id='line_2828'>And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,</a>
<a id='line_2829'>the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncleâ€™s son, and in</a>
<a id='line_2830'>the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the</a>
<a id='line_2831'>purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.</a>
<a id='line_2832'></a>
<a id='line_2833'>32:13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 32:14 Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_2834'>LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence</a>
<a id='line_2835'>of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is</a>
<a id='line_2836'>open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many</a>
<a id='line_2837'>days.</a>
<a id='line_2838'></a>
<a id='line_2839'>32:15 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and</a>
<a id='line_2840'>fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</a>
<a id='line_2841'></a>
<a id='line_2842'>32:16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto</a>
<a id='line_2843'>Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, 32:17 Ah</a>
<a id='line_2844'>Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great</a>
<a id='line_2845'>power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:</a>
<a id='line_2846'>32:18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the</a>
<a id='line_2847'>iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them:</a>
<a id='line_2848'>the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name, 32:19 Great</a>
<a id='line_2849'>in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the</a>
<a id='line_2850'>ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and</a>
<a id='line_2851'>according to the fruit of his doings: 32:20 Which hast set signs and</a>
<a id='line_2852'>wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_2853'>among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; 32:21 And</a>
<a id='line_2854'>hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with</a>
<a id='line_2855'>signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched</a>
<a id='line_2856'>out arm, and with great terror; 32:22 And hast given them this land,</a>
<a id='line_2857'>which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing</a>
<a id='line_2858'>with milk and honey; 32:23 And they came in, and possessed it; but</a>
<a id='line_2859'>they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done</a>
<a id='line_2860'>nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2861'>caused all this evil to come upon them: 32:24 Behold the mounts, they</a>
<a id='line_2862'>are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand</a>
<a id='line_2863'>of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of</a>
<a id='line_2864'>the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come</a>
<a id='line_2865'>to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.</a>
<a id='line_2866'></a>
<a id='line_2867'>32:25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for</a>
<a id='line_2868'>money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_2869'>Chaldeans.</a>
<a id='line_2870'></a>
<a id='line_2871'>32:26 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 32:27</a>
<a id='line_2872'>Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too</a>
<a id='line_2873'>hard for me?  32:28 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give</a>
<a id='line_2874'>this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_2875'>Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: 32:29 And the</a>
<a id='line_2876'>Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on</a>
<a id='line_2877'>this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have</a>
<a id='line_2878'>offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other</a>
<a id='line_2879'>gods, to provoke me to anger.</a>
<a id='line_2880'></a>
<a id='line_2881'>32:30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only</a>
<a id='line_2882'>done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have</a>
<a id='line_2883'>only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the</a>
<a id='line_2884'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2885'></a>
<a id='line_2886'>32:31 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and</a>
<a id='line_2887'>of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I</a>
<a id='line_2888'>should remove it from before my face, 32:32 Because of all the evil of</a>
<a id='line_2889'>the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have</a>
<a id='line_2890'>done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their</a>
<a id='line_2891'>priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_2892'>of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2893'></a>
<a id='line_2894'>32:33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though</a>
<a id='line_2895'>I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not</a>
<a id='line_2896'>hearkened to receive instruction.</a>
<a id='line_2897'></a>
<a id='line_2898'>32:34 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by</a>
<a id='line_2899'>my name, to defile it.</a>
<a id='line_2900'></a>
<a id='line_2901'>32:35 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley</a>
<a id='line_2902'>of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass</a>
<a id='line_2903'>through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came</a>
<a id='line_2904'>it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah</a>
<a id='line_2905'>to sin.</a>
<a id='line_2906'></a>
<a id='line_2907'>32:36 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the</a>
<a id='line_2909'>hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by</a>
<a id='line_2910'>the pestilence; 32:37 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries,</a>
<a id='line_2911'>whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great</a>
<a id='line_2912'>wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause</a>
<a id='line_2913'>them to dwell safely: 32:38 And they shall be my people, and I will be</a>
<a id='line_2914'>their God: 32:39 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that</a>
<a id='line_2915'>they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children</a>
<a id='line_2916'>after them: 32:40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them,</a>
<a id='line_2917'>that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put</a>
<a id='line_2918'>my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</a>
<a id='line_2919'></a>
<a id='line_2920'>32:41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant</a>
<a id='line_2921'>them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole</a>
<a id='line_2922'>soul.</a>
<a id='line_2923'></a>
<a id='line_2924'>32:42 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great</a>
<a id='line_2925'>evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I</a>
<a id='line_2926'>have promised them.</a>
<a id='line_2927'></a>
<a id='line_2928'>32:43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is</a>
<a id='line_2929'>desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_2930'>Chaldeans.</a>
<a id='line_2931'></a>
<a id='line_2932'>32:44 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and</a>
<a id='line_2933'>seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the</a>
<a id='line_2934'>places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities</a>
<a id='line_2935'>of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities</a>
<a id='line_2936'>of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the</a>
<a id='line_2937'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2938'></a>
<a id='line_2939'>33:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,</a>
<a id='line_2940'>while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, 33:2 Thus</a>
<a id='line_2941'>saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to</a>
<a id='line_2942'>establish it; the LORD is his name; 33:3 Call unto me, and I will</a>
<a id='line_2943'>answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest</a>
<a id='line_2944'>not.</a>
<a id='line_2945'></a>
<a id='line_2946'>33:4 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses</a>
<a id='line_2947'>of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which</a>
<a id='line_2948'>are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 33:5 They come to</a>
<a id='line_2949'>fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies</a>
<a id='line_2950'>of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all</a>
<a id='line_2951'>whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.</a>
<a id='line_2952'></a>
<a id='line_2953'>33:6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.</a>
<a id='line_2955'></a>
<a id='line_2956'>33:7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of</a>
<a id='line_2957'>Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</a>
<a id='line_2958'></a>
<a id='line_2959'>33:8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they</a>
<a id='line_2960'>have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities,</a>
<a id='line_2961'>whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against</a>
<a id='line_2962'>me.</a>
<a id='line_2963'></a>
<a id='line_2964'>33:9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour</a>
<a id='line_2965'>before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good</a>
<a id='line_2966'>that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the</a>
<a id='line_2967'>goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.</a>
<a id='line_2968'></a>
<a id='line_2969'>33:10 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,</a>
<a id='line_2970'>which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in</a>
<a id='line_2971'>the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are</a>
<a id='line_2972'>desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>33:11 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_2974'>bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall</a>
<a id='line_2975'>say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy</a>
<a id='line_2976'>endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of</a>
<a id='line_2977'>praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the</a>
<a id='line_2978'>captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2979'></a>
<a id='line_2980'>33:12 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is</a>
<a id='line_2981'>desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof,</a>
<a id='line_2982'>shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>33:13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and</a>
<a id='line_2985'>in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the</a>
<a id='line_2986'>places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks</a>
<a id='line_2987'>pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2988'></a>
<a id='line_2989'>33:14 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that</a>
<a id='line_2990'>good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the</a>
<a id='line_2991'>house of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>33:15 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of</a>
<a id='line_2994'>righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and</a>
<a id='line_2995'>righteousness in the land.</a>
<a id='line_2996'></a>
<a id='line_2997'>33:16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell</a>
<a id='line_2998'>safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD</a>
<a id='line_2999'>our righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_3000'></a>
<a id='line_3001'>33:17 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit</a>
<a id='line_3002'>upon the throne of the house of Israel; 33:18 Neither shall the</a>
<a id='line_3003'>priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and</a>
<a id='line_3004'>to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</a>
<a id='line_3005'></a>
<a id='line_3006'>33:19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 33:20 Thus</a>
<a id='line_3007'>saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my</a>
<a id='line_3008'>covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in</a>
<a id='line_3009'>their season; 33:21 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my</a>
<a id='line_3010'>servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and</a>
<a id='line_3011'>with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</a>
<a id='line_3012'></a>
<a id='line_3013'>33:22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of</a>
<a id='line_3014'>the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and</a>
<a id='line_3015'>the Levites that minister unto me.</a>
<a id='line_3016'></a>
<a id='line_3017'>33:23 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 33:24</a>
<a id='line_3018'>Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two</a>
<a id='line_3019'>families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus</a>
<a id='line_3020'>they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation</a>
<a id='line_3021'>before them.</a>
<a id='line_3022'></a>
<a id='line_3023'>33:25 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,</a>
<a id='line_3024'>and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 33:26</a>
<a id='line_3025'>Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that</a>
<a id='line_3026'>I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham,</a>
<a id='line_3027'>Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have</a>
<a id='line_3028'>mercy on them.</a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when</a>
<a id='line_3031'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms</a>
<a id='line_3032'>of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against</a>
<a id='line_3033'>Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying, 34:2 Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_3034'>the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah,</a>
<a id='line_3035'>and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into</a>
<a id='line_3036'>the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: 34:3</a>
<a id='line_3037'>And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_3039'>the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and</a>
<a id='line_3040'>thou shalt go to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_3041'></a>
<a id='line_3042'>34:4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus</a>
<a id='line_3043'>saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 34:5 But thou</a>
<a id='line_3044'>shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former</a>
<a id='line_3045'>kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and</a>
<a id='line_3046'>they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the</a>
<a id='line_3047'>word, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3048'></a>
<a id='line_3049'>34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah</a>
<a id='line_3050'>king of Judah in Jerusalem, 34:7 When the king of Babylonâ€™s army</a>
<a id='line_3051'>fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that</a>
<a id='line_3052'>were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced</a>
<a id='line_3053'>cities remained of the cities of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3054'></a>
<a id='line_3055'>34:8 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after</a>
<a id='line_3056'>that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which</a>
<a id='line_3057'>were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 34:9 That every man</a>
<a id='line_3058'>should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an</a>
<a id='line_3059'>Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of</a>
<a id='line_3060'>them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.</a>
<a id='line_3061'></a>
<a id='line_3062'>34:10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered</a>
<a id='line_3063'>into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and</a>
<a id='line_3064'>every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves</a>
<a id='line_3065'>of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.</a>
<a id='line_3066'></a>
<a id='line_3067'>34:11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the</a>
<a id='line_3068'>handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into</a>
<a id='line_3069'>subjection for servants and for handmaids.</a>
<a id='line_3070'></a>
<a id='line_3071'>34:12 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3072'>saying, 34:13 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a</a>
<a id='line_3073'>covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of</a>
<a id='line_3074'>the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, 34:14 At the</a>
<a id='line_3075'>end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which</a>
<a id='line_3076'>hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou</a>
<a id='line_3077'>shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto</a>
<a id='line_3078'>me, neither inclined their ear.</a>
<a id='line_3079'></a>
<a id='line_3080'>34:15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in</a>
<a id='line_3081'>proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a</a>
<a id='line_3082'>covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: 34:16 But</a>
<a id='line_3083'>ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and</a>
<a id='line_3084'>every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure,</a>
<a id='line_3085'>to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for</a>
<a id='line_3086'>servants and for handmaids.</a>
<a id='line_3087'></a>
<a id='line_3088'>34:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in</a>
<a id='line_3089'>proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his</a>
<a id='line_3090'>neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to</a>
<a id='line_3091'>the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you</a>
<a id='line_3092'>to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3093'></a>
<a id='line_3094'>34:18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,</a>
<a id='line_3095'>which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made</a>
<a id='line_3096'>before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the</a>
<a id='line_3097'>parts thereof, 34:19 The princes of Judah, and the princes of</a>
<a id='line_3098'>Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the</a>
<a id='line_3099'>land, which passed between the parts of the calf; 34:20 I will even</a>
<a id='line_3100'>give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them</a>
<a id='line_3101'>that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the</a>
<a id='line_3102'>fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>34:21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the</a>
<a id='line_3105'>hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life,</a>
<a id='line_3106'>and into the hand of the king of Babylonâ€™s army, which are gone up</a>
<a id='line_3107'>from you.</a>
<a id='line_3108'></a>
<a id='line_3109'>34:22 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return</a>
<a id='line_3110'>to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn</a>
<a id='line_3111'>it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without</a>
<a id='line_3112'>an inhabitant.</a>
<a id='line_3113'></a>
<a id='line_3114'>35:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of</a>
<a id='line_3115'>Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 35:2 Go unto the</a>
<a id='line_3116'>house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the</a>
<a id='line_3117'>house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to</a>
<a id='line_3118'>drink.</a>
<a id='line_3119'></a>
<a id='line_3120'>35:3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,</a>
<a id='line_3121'>and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the</a>
<a id='line_3122'>Rechabites; 35:4 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into</a>
<a id='line_3123'>the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber</a>
<a id='line_3125'>of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 35:5 And I set</a>
<a id='line_3126'>before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and</a>
<a id='line_3127'>cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</a>
<a id='line_3128'></a>
<a id='line_3129'>35:6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of</a>
<a id='line_3130'>Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,</a>
<a id='line_3131'>neither ye, nor your sons for ever: 35:7 Neither shall ye build house,</a>
<a id='line_3132'>nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye</a>
<a id='line_3133'>shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye</a>
<a id='line_3134'>be strangers.</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>
<a id='line_3136'>35:8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our</a>
<a id='line_3137'>father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days,</a>
<a id='line_3138'>we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 35:9 Nor to build houses</a>
<a id='line_3139'>for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:</a>
<a id='line_3140'>35:10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according</a>
<a id='line_3141'>to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</a>
<a id='line_3142'></a>
<a id='line_3143'>35:11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up</a>
<a id='line_3144'>into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear</a>
<a id='line_3145'>of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians:</a>
<a id='line_3146'>so we dwell at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3147'></a>
<a id='line_3148'>35:12 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 35:13 Thus</a>
<a id='line_3149'>saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of</a>
<a id='line_3150'>Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive</a>
<a id='line_3151'>instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>35:14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his</a>
<a id='line_3154'>sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink</a>
<a id='line_3155'>none, but obey their fatherâ€™s commandment: notwithstanding I have</a>
<a id='line_3156'>spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto</a>
<a id='line_3157'>me.</a>
<a id='line_3158'></a>
<a id='line_3159'>35:15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising</a>
<a id='line_3160'>up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his</a>
<a id='line_3161'>evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve</a>
<a id='line_3162'>them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to</a>
<a id='line_3163'>your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto</a>
<a id='line_3164'>me.</a>
<a id='line_3165'></a>
<a id='line_3166'>35:16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the</a>
<a id='line_3167'>commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people</a>
<a id='line_3168'>hath not hearkened unto me: 35:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_3169'>hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all</a>
<a id='line_3170'>the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced</a>
<a id='line_3171'>against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not</a>
<a id='line_3172'>heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.</a>
<a id='line_3173'></a>
<a id='line_3174'>35:18 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_3175'>the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the</a>
<a id='line_3176'>commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and</a>
<a id='line_3177'>done according unto all that he hath commanded you: 35:19 Therefore</a>
<a id='line_3178'>thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of</a>
<a id='line_3179'>Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3180'></a>
<a id='line_3181'>36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of</a>
<a id='line_3182'>Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3183'>saying, 36:2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the</a>
<a id='line_3184'>words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah,</a>
<a id='line_3185'>and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the</a>
<a id='line_3186'>days of Josiah, even unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
<a id='line_3188'>36:3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I</a>
<a id='line_3189'>purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil</a>
<a id='line_3190'>way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</a>
<a id='line_3191'></a>
<a id='line_3192'>36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote</a>
<a id='line_3193'>from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had</a>
<a id='line_3194'>spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.</a>
<a id='line_3195'></a>
<a id='line_3196'>36:5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go</a>
<a id='line_3197'>into the house of the LORD: 36:6 Therefore go thou, and read in the</a>
<a id='line_3198'>roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in</a>
<a id='line_3199'>the ears of the people in the LORDâ€™s house upon the fasting day: and</a>
<a id='line_3200'>also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of</a>
<a id='line_3201'>their cities.</a>
<a id='line_3202'></a>
<a id='line_3203'>36:7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3204'>and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger</a>
<a id='line_3205'>and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.</a>
<a id='line_3206'></a>
<a id='line_3207'>36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah</a>
<a id='line_3208'>the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3209'>in the LORDâ€™s house.</a>
<a id='line_3210'></a>
<a id='line_3211'>36:9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of</a>
<a id='line_3212'>Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast</a>
<a id='line_3213'>before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people</a>
<a id='line_3214'>that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3215'></a>
<a id='line_3216'>36:10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house</a>
<a id='line_3217'>of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe,</a>
<a id='line_3218'>in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORDâ€™s house,</a>
<a id='line_3219'>in the ears of all the people.</a>
<a id='line_3220'></a>
<a id='line_3221'>36:11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard</a>
<a id='line_3222'>out of the book all the words of the LORD, 36:12 Then he went down</a>
<a id='line_3223'>into the kingâ€™s house, into the scribeâ€™s chamber: and, lo, all the</a>
<a id='line_3224'>princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_3225'>Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of</a>
<a id='line_3226'>Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</a>
<a id='line_3227'></a>
<a id='line_3228'>36:13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had</a>
<a id='line_3229'>heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</a>
<a id='line_3230'></a>
<a id='line_3231'>36:14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the</a>
<a id='line_3232'>son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine</a>
<a id='line_3233'>hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and</a>
<a id='line_3234'>come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came</a>
<a id='line_3235'>unto them.</a>
<a id='line_3236'></a>
<a id='line_3237'>36:15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.</a>
<a id='line_3238'>So Baruch read it in their ears.</a>
<a id='line_3239'></a>
<a id='line_3240'>36:16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they</a>
<a id='line_3241'>were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely</a>
<a id='line_3242'>tell the king of all these words.</a>
<a id='line_3243'></a>
<a id='line_3244'>36:17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write</a>
<a id='line_3245'>all these words at his mouth?  36:18 Then Baruch answered them, He</a>
<a id='line_3246'>pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them</a>
<a id='line_3247'>with ink in the book.</a>
<a id='line_3248'></a>
<a id='line_3249'>36:19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and</a>
<a id='line_3250'>Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</a>
<a id='line_3251'></a>
<a id='line_3252'>36:20 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up</a>
<a id='line_3253'>the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words</a>
<a id='line_3254'>in the ears of the king.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'>36:21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of</a>
<a id='line_3257'>Elishama the scribeâ€™s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the</a>
<a id='line_3258'>king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.</a>
<a id='line_3259'></a>
<a id='line_3260'>36:22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and</a>
<a id='line_3261'>there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.</a>
<a id='line_3262'></a>
<a id='line_3263'>36:23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four</a>
<a id='line_3264'>leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that</a>
<a id='line_3265'>was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that</a>
<a id='line_3266'>was on the hearth.</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
<a id='line_3268'>36:24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the</a>
<a id='line_3269'>king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</a>
<a id='line_3270'></a>
<a id='line_3271'>36:25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made</a>
<a id='line_3272'>intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would</a>
<a id='line_3273'>not hear them.</a>
<a id='line_3274'></a>
<a id='line_3275'>36:26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and</a>
<a id='line_3276'>Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take</a>
<a id='line_3277'>Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.</a>
<a id='line_3278'></a>
<a id='line_3279'>36:27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king</a>
<a id='line_3280'>had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_3281'>Jeremiah, saying, 36:28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it</a>
<a id='line_3282'>all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the</a>
<a id='line_3283'>king of Judah hath burned.</a>
<a id='line_3284'></a>
<a id='line_3285'>36:29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_3286'>LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written</a>
<a id='line_3287'>therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy</a>
<a id='line_3288'>this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?  36:30</a>
<a id='line_3289'>Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall</a>
<a id='line_3290'>have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be</a>
<a id='line_3291'>cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</a>
<a id='line_3292'></a>
<a id='line_3293'>36:31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their</a>
<a id='line_3294'>iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_3295'>Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have</a>
<a id='line_3296'>pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</a>
<a id='line_3297'></a>
<a id='line_3298'>36:32 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the</a>
<a id='line_3299'>scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_3300'>Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had</a>
<a id='line_3301'>burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like</a>
<a id='line_3302'>words.</a>
<a id='line_3303'></a>
<a id='line_3304'>37:1 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the</a>
<a id='line_3305'>son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the</a>
<a id='line_3306'>land of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3307'></a>
<a id='line_3308'>37:2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did</a>
<a id='line_3309'>hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet</a>
<a id='line_3310'>Jeremiah.</a>
<a id='line_3311'></a>
<a id='line_3312'>37:3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and</a>
<a id='line_3313'>Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah,</a>
<a id='line_3314'>saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.</a>
<a id='line_3315'></a>
<a id='line_3316'>37:4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had</a>
<a id='line_3317'>not put him into prison.</a>
<a id='line_3318'></a>
<a id='line_3319'>37:5 Then Pharaohâ€™s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the</a>
<a id='line_3320'>Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed</a>
<a id='line_3321'>from Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3322'></a>
<a id='line_3323'>37:6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,</a>
<a id='line_3324'>37:7 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the</a>
<a id='line_3325'>king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold,</a>
<a id='line_3326'>Pharaohâ€™s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt</a>
<a id='line_3327'>into their own land.</a>
<a id='line_3328'></a>
<a id='line_3329'>37:8 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city,</a>
<a id='line_3330'>and take it, and burn it with fire.</a>
<a id='line_3331'></a>
<a id='line_3332'>37:9 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_3333'>Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</a>
<a id='line_3334'></a>
<a id='line_3335'>37:10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that</a>
<a id='line_3336'>fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet</a>
<a id='line_3337'>should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with</a>
<a id='line_3338'>fire.</a>
<a id='line_3339'></a>
<a id='line_3340'>37:11 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was</a>
<a id='line_3341'>broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaohâ€™s army, 37:12 Then</a>
<a id='line_3342'>Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin,</a>
<a id='line_3343'>to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</a>
<a id='line_3344'></a>
<a id='line_3345'>37:13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward</a>
<a id='line_3346'>was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of</a>
<a id='line_3347'>Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away</a>
<a id='line_3348'>to the Chaldeans.</a>
<a id='line_3349'></a>
<a id='line_3350'>37:14 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the</a>
<a id='line_3351'>Chaldeans.</a>
<a id='line_3352'></a>
<a id='line_3353'>But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him</a>
<a id='line_3354'>to the princes.</a>
<a id='line_3355'></a>
<a id='line_3356'>37:15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they</a>
<a id='line_3358'>had made that the prison.</a>
<a id='line_3359'></a>
<a id='line_3360'>37:16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,</a>
<a id='line_3361'>and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 37:17 Then Zedekiah the</a>
<a id='line_3362'>king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his</a>
<a id='line_3363'>house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said,</a>
<a id='line_3364'>There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_3365'>king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_3366'></a>
<a id='line_3367'>37:18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended</a>
<a id='line_3368'>against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye</a>
<a id='line_3369'>have put me in prison?  37:19 Where are now your prophets which</a>
<a id='line_3370'>prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come</a>
<a id='line_3371'>against you, nor against this land?  37:20 Therefore hear now, I pray</a>
<a id='line_3372'>thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be</a>
<a id='line_3373'>accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of</a>
<a id='line_3374'>Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</a>
<a id='line_3375'></a>
<a id='line_3376'>37:21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit</a>
<a id='line_3377'>Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him</a>
<a id='line_3378'>daily a piece of bread out of the bakersâ€™ street, until all the bread</a>
<a id='line_3379'>in the city were spent.</a>
<a id='line_3380'></a>
<a id='line_3381'>Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</a>
<a id='line_3382'></a>
<a id='line_3383'>38:1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of</a>
<a id='line_3384'>Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of</a>
<a id='line_3385'>Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the</a>
<a id='line_3386'>people, saying, 38:2 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this</a>
<a id='line_3387'>city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but</a>
<a id='line_3388'>he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his</a>
<a id='line_3389'>life for a prey, and shall live.</a>
<a id='line_3390'></a>
<a id='line_3391'>38:3 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the</a>
<a id='line_3392'>hand of the king of Babylonâ€™s army, which shall take it.</a>
<a id='line_3393'></a>
<a id='line_3394'>38:4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let</a>
<a id='line_3395'>this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men</a>
<a id='line_3396'>of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in</a>
<a id='line_3397'>speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of</a>
<a id='line_3398'>this people, but the hurt.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>38:5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the</a>
<a id='line_3401'>king is not he that can do any thing against you.</a>
<a id='line_3402'></a>
<a id='line_3403'>38:6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of</a>
<a id='line_3404'>Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison:</a>
<a id='line_3405'>and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no</a>
<a id='line_3406'>water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</a>
<a id='line_3407'></a>
<a id='line_3408'>38:7 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was</a>
<a id='line_3409'>in the kingâ€™s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon;</a>
<a id='line_3410'>the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 38:8 Ebedmelech went</a>
<a id='line_3411'>forth out of the kingâ€™s house, and spake to the king saying, 38:9 My</a>
<a id='line_3412'>lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to</a>
<a id='line_3413'>Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is</a>
<a id='line_3414'>like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more</a>
<a id='line_3415'>bread in the city.</a>
<a id='line_3416'></a>
<a id='line_3417'>38:10 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take</a>
<a id='line_3418'>from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out</a>
<a id='line_3419'>of the dungeon, before he die.</a>
<a id='line_3420'></a>
<a id='line_3421'>38:11 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of</a>
<a id='line_3422'>the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old</a>
<a id='line_3423'>rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</a>
<a id='line_3424'></a>
<a id='line_3425'>38:12 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these</a>
<a id='line_3426'>old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords.</a>
<a id='line_3427'>And Jeremiah did so.</a>
<a id='line_3428'></a>
<a id='line_3429'>38:13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the</a>
<a id='line_3430'>dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</a>
<a id='line_3431'></a>
<a id='line_3432'>38:14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto</a>
<a id='line_3433'>him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the</a>
<a id='line_3434'>king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from</a>
<a id='line_3435'>me.</a>
<a id='line_3436'></a>
<a id='line_3437'>38:15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_3438'>wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt</a>
<a id='line_3439'>thou not hearken unto me?  38:16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly</a>
<a id='line_3440'>unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I</a>
<a id='line_3441'>will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of</a>
<a id='line_3442'>these men that seek thy life.</a>
<a id='line_3443'></a>
<a id='line_3444'>38:17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God</a>
<a id='line_3445'>of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the</a>
<a id='line_3446'>king of Babylonâ€™s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city</a>
<a id='line_3447'>shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</a>
<a id='line_3448'>38:18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylonâ€™s princes,</a>
<a id='line_3449'>then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they</a>
<a id='line_3450'>shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</a>
<a id='line_3451'></a>
<a id='line_3452'>38:19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the</a>
<a id='line_3453'>Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their</a>
<a id='line_3454'>hand, and they mock me.</a>
<a id='line_3455'></a>
<a id='line_3456'>38:20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech</a>
<a id='line_3457'>thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be</a>
<a id='line_3458'>well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</a>
<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>38:21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3461'>hath shewed me: 38:22 And, behold, all the women that are left in the</a>
<a id='line_3462'>king of Judahâ€™s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylonâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_3463'>princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and</a>
<a id='line_3464'>have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they</a>
<a id='line_3465'>are turned away back.</a>
<a id='line_3466'></a>
<a id='line_3467'>38:23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the</a>
<a id='line_3468'>Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be</a>
<a id='line_3469'>taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this</a>
<a id='line_3470'>city to be burned with fire.</a>
<a id='line_3471'></a>
<a id='line_3472'>38:24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these</a>
<a id='line_3473'>words, and thou shalt not die.</a>
<a id='line_3474'></a>
<a id='line_3475'>38:25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they</a>
<a id='line_3476'>come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3477'>said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to</a>
<a id='line_3478'>death; also what the king said unto thee: 38:26 Then thou shalt say</a>
<a id='line_3479'>unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would</a>
<a id='line_3480'>not cause me to return to Jonathanâ€™s house, to die there.</a>
<a id='line_3481'></a>
<a id='line_3482'>38:27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he</a>
<a id='line_3483'>told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So</a>
<a id='line_3484'>they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</a>
<a id='line_3485'></a>
<a id='line_3486'>38:28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that</a>
<a id='line_3487'>Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.</a>
<a id='line_3488'></a>
<a id='line_3489'>39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,</a>
<a id='line_3490'>came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against</a>
<a id='line_3491'>Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</a>
<a id='line_3492'></a>
<a id='line_3493'>39:2 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the</a>
<a id='line_3494'>ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.</a>
<a id='line_3495'></a>
<a id='line_3496'>39:3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in</a>
<a id='line_3497'>the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris,</a>
<a id='line_3498'>Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_3499'>king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_3500'></a>
<a id='line_3501'>39:4 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw</a>
<a id='line_3502'>them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of</a>
<a id='line_3503'>the city by night, by the way of the kingâ€™s garden, by the gate</a>
<a id='line_3504'>betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.</a>
<a id='line_3505'></a>
<a id='line_3506'>39:5 But the Chaldeansâ€™ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah</a>
<a id='line_3507'>in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought</a>
<a id='line_3508'>him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of</a>
<a id='line_3509'>Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</a>
<a id='line_3510'></a>
<a id='line_3511'>39:6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah</a>
<a id='line_3512'>before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of</a>
<a id='line_3513'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3514'></a>
<a id='line_3515'>39:7 Moreover he put out Zedekiahâ€™s eyes, and bound him with chains,</a>
<a id='line_3516'>to carry him to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_3517'></a>
<a id='line_3518'>39:8 And the Chaldeans burned the kingâ€™s house, and the houses of the</a>
<a id='line_3519'>people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3520'></a>
<a id='line_3521'>39:9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive</a>
<a id='line_3522'>into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and</a>
<a id='line_3523'>those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people</a>
<a id='line_3524'>that remained.</a>
<a id='line_3525'></a>
<a id='line_3526'>39:10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the</a>
<a id='line_3527'>people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them</a>
<a id='line_3528'>vineyards and fields at the same time.</a>
<a id='line_3529'></a>
<a id='line_3530'>39:11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning</a>
<a id='line_3531'>Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, 39:12 Take</a>
<a id='line_3532'>him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as</a>
<a id='line_3533'>he shall say unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_3534'></a>
<a id='line_3535'>39:13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,</a>
<a id='line_3536'>Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylonâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_3537'>princes; 39:14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of</a>
<a id='line_3538'>the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son</a>
<a id='line_3539'>of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the</a>
<a id='line_3540'>people.</a>
<a id='line_3541'></a>
<a id='line_3542'>39:15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut</a>
<a id='line_3543'>up in the court of the prison, saying, 39:16 Go and speak to</a>
<a id='line_3544'>Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the</a>
<a id='line_3545'>God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil,</a>
<a id='line_3546'>and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before</a>
<a id='line_3547'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_3548'></a>
<a id='line_3549'>39:17 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou</a>
<a id='line_3550'>shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>39:18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the</a>
<a id='line_3553'>sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3554'>put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3555'></a>
<a id='line_3556'>40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that</a>
<a id='line_3557'>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when</a>
<a id='line_3558'>he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried</a>
<a id='line_3559'>away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive</a>
<a id='line_3560'>unto Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_3561'></a>
<a id='line_3562'>40:2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_3563'>The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</a>
<a id='line_3564'></a>
<a id='line_3565'>40:3 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:</a>
<a id='line_3566'>because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his</a>
<a id='line_3567'>voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</a>
<a id='line_3568'></a>
<a id='line_3569'>40:4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were</a>
<a id='line_3570'>upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into</a>
<a id='line_3571'>Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto</a>
<a id='line_3572'>thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is</a>
<a id='line_3573'>before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,</a>
<a id='line_3574'>thither go.</a>
<a id='line_3575'></a>
<a id='line_3576'>40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to</a>
<a id='line_3577'>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of</a>
<a id='line_3578'>Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with</a>
<a id='line_3579'>him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto</a>
<a id='line_3580'>thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a</a>
<a id='line_3581'>reward, and let him go.</a>
<a id='line_3582'></a>
<a id='line_3583'>40:6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and</a>
<a id='line_3584'>dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</a>
<a id='line_3585'></a>
<a id='line_3586'>40:7 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields,</a>
<a id='line_3587'>even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made</a>
<a id='line_3588'>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed</a>
<a id='line_3589'>unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of</a>
<a id='line_3590'>them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; 40:8 Then they</a>
<a id='line_3591'>came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and</a>
<a id='line_3592'>Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of</a>
<a id='line_3593'>Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the</a>
<a id='line_3594'>son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</a>
<a id='line_3595'></a>
<a id='line_3596'>40:9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them</a>
<a id='line_3597'>and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in</a>
<a id='line_3598'>the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with</a>
<a id='line_3599'>you.</a>
<a id='line_3600'></a>
<a id='line_3601'>40:10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the</a>
<a id='line_3602'>Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer</a>
<a id='line_3603'>fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your</a>
<a id='line_3604'>cities that ye have taken.</a>
<a id='line_3605'></a>
<a id='line_3606'>40:11 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the</a>
<a id='line_3607'>Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that</a>
<a id='line_3608'>the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set</a>
<a id='line_3609'>over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 40:12 Even</a>
<a id='line_3610'>all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and</a>
<a id='line_3611'>came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine</a>
<a id='line_3612'>and summer fruits very much.</a>
<a id='line_3613'></a>
<a id='line_3614'>40:13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the</a>
<a id='line_3615'>forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 40:14 And</a>
<a id='line_3616'>said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the</a>
<a id='line_3617'>Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But</a>
<a id='line_3618'>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.</a>
<a id='line_3619'></a>
<a id='line_3620'>40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah</a>
<a id='line_3621'>secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the</a>
<a id='line_3622'>son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay</a>
<a id='line_3623'>thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be</a>
<a id='line_3624'>scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?  40:16 But Gedaliah the</a>
<a id='line_3625'>son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do</a>
<a id='line_3626'>this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</a>
<a id='line_3627'></a>
<a id='line_3628'>41:1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of</a>
<a id='line_3629'>Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of</a>
<a id='line_3630'>the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam</a>
<a id='line_3631'>to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</a>
<a id='line_3632'></a>
<a id='line_3633'>41:2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that</a>
<a id='line_3634'>were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan</a>
<a id='line_3635'>with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made</a>
<a id='line_3636'>governor over the land.</a>
<a id='line_3637'></a>
<a id='line_3638'>41:3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with</a>
<a id='line_3639'>Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the</a>
<a id='line_3640'>men of war.</a>
<a id='line_3641'></a>
<a id='line_3642'>41:4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah,</a>
<a id='line_3643'>and no man knew it, 41:5 That there came certain from Shechem, from</a>
<a id='line_3644'>Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards</a>
<a id='line_3645'>shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with</a>
<a id='line_3646'>offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the</a>
<a id='line_3647'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3648'></a>
<a id='line_3649'>41:6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet</a>
<a id='line_3650'>them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met</a>
<a id='line_3651'>them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</a>
<a id='line_3652'></a>
<a id='line_3653'>41:7 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that</a>
<a id='line_3654'>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst</a>
<a id='line_3655'>of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.</a>
<a id='line_3656'></a>
<a id='line_3657'>41:8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us</a>
<a id='line_3658'>not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and</a>
<a id='line_3659'>of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their</a>
<a id='line_3660'>brethren.</a>
<a id='line_3661'></a>
<a id='line_3662'>41:9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the</a>
<a id='line_3663'>men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king</a>
<a id='line_3664'>had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of</a>
<a id='line_3665'>Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.</a>
<a id='line_3666'></a>
<a id='line_3667'>41:10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people</a>
<a id='line_3668'>that were in Mizpah, even the kingâ€™s daughters, and all the people</a>
<a id='line_3669'>that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had</a>
<a id='line_3670'>committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of</a>
<a id='line_3671'>Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the</a>
<a id='line_3672'>Ammonites.</a>
<a id='line_3673'></a>
<a id='line_3674'>41:11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the</a>
<a id='line_3675'>forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son</a>
<a id='line_3676'>of Nethaniah had done, 41:12 Then they took all the men, and went to</a>
<a id='line_3677'>fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great</a>
<a id='line_3678'>waters that are in Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_3679'></a>
<a id='line_3680'>41:13 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with</a>
<a id='line_3681'>Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the</a>
<a id='line_3682'>forces that were with him, then they were glad.</a>
<a id='line_3683'></a>
<a id='line_3684'>41:14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from</a>
<a id='line_3685'>Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of</a>
<a id='line_3686'>Kareah.</a>
<a id='line_3687'></a>
<a id='line_3688'>41:15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight</a>
<a id='line_3689'>men, and went to the Ammonites.</a>
<a id='line_3690'></a>
<a id='line_3691'>41:16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the</a>
<a id='line_3692'>forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had</a>
<a id='line_3693'>recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that</a>
<a id='line_3694'>he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and</a>
<a id='line_3695'>the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought</a>
<a id='line_3696'>again from Gibeon: 41:17 And they departed, and dwelt in the</a>
<a id='line_3697'>habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into</a>
<a id='line_3698'>Egypt, 41:18 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,</a>
<a id='line_3699'>because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of</a>
<a id='line_3700'>Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.</a>
<a id='line_3701'></a>
<a id='line_3702'>42:1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of</a>
<a id='line_3703'>Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the</a>
<a id='line_3704'>least even unto the greatest, came near, 42:2 And said unto Jeremiah</a>
<a id='line_3705'>the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before</a>
<a id='line_3706'>thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this</a>
<a id='line_3707'>remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold</a>
<a id='line_3708'>us:) 42:3 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may</a>
<a id='line_3709'>walk, and the thing that we may do.</a>
<a id='line_3710'></a>
<a id='line_3711'>42:4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;</a>
<a id='line_3712'>behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words;</a>
<a id='line_3713'>and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer</a>
<a id='line_3714'>you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</a>
<a id='line_3715'></a>
<a id='line_3716'>42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful</a>
<a id='line_3717'>witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the</a>
<a id='line_3718'>which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.</a>
<a id='line_3719'></a>
<a id='line_3720'>42:6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice</a>
<a id='line_3721'>of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with</a>
<a id='line_3722'>us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_3723'></a>
<a id='line_3724'>42:7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3725'>came unto Jeremiah.</a>
<a id='line_3726'></a>
<a id='line_3727'>42:8 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of</a>
<a id='line_3728'>the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even</a>
<a id='line_3729'>to the greatest, 42:9 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God</a>
<a id='line_3730'>of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before</a>
<a id='line_3731'>him; 42:10 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,</a>
<a id='line_3732'>and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for</a>
<a id='line_3733'>I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.</a>
<a id='line_3734'></a>
<a id='line_3735'>42:11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be</a>
<a id='line_3736'>not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and</a>
<a id='line_3737'>to deliver you from his hand.</a>
<a id='line_3738'></a>
<a id='line_3739'>42:12 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon</a>
<a id='line_3740'>you, and cause you to return to your own land.</a>
<a id='line_3741'></a>
<a id='line_3742'>42:13 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the</a>
<a id='line_3743'>voice of the LORD your God, 42:14 Saying, No; but we will go into the</a>
<a id='line_3744'>land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_3745'>trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: 42:15 And</a>
<a id='line_3746'>now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus</a>
<a id='line_3747'>saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your</a>
<a id='line_3748'>faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 42:16 Then it</a>
<a id='line_3749'>shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake</a>
<a id='line_3750'>you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were</a>
<a id='line_3751'>afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye</a>
<a id='line_3752'>shall die.</a>
<a id='line_3753'></a>
<a id='line_3754'>42:17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into</a>
<a id='line_3755'>Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from</a>
<a id='line_3757'>the evil that I will bring upon them.</a>
<a id='line_3758'></a>
<a id='line_3759'>42:18 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine</a>
<a id='line_3760'>anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_3761'>Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3762'>enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment,</a>
<a id='line_3763'>and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.</a>
<a id='line_3764'></a>
<a id='line_3765'>42:19 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye</a>
<a id='line_3766'>not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.</a>
<a id='line_3767'></a>
<a id='line_3768'>42:20 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3769'>your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according</a>
<a id='line_3770'>unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we</a>
<a id='line_3771'>will do it.</a>
<a id='line_3772'></a>
<a id='line_3773'>42:21 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not</a>
<a id='line_3774'>obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he</a>
<a id='line_3775'>hath sent me unto you.</a>
<a id='line_3776'></a>
<a id='line_3777'>42:22 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by</a>
<a id='line_3778'>the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to</a>
<a id='line_3779'>go and to sojourn.</a>
<a id='line_3780'></a>
<a id='line_3781'>43:1 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of</a>
<a id='line_3782'>speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for</a>
<a id='line_3783'>which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</a>
<a id='line_3784'>43:2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of</a>
<a id='line_3785'>Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest</a>
<a id='line_3786'>falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt</a>
<a id='line_3787'>to sojourn there: 43:3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on</a>
<a id='line_3788'>against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that</a>
<a id='line_3789'>they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_3790'></a>
<a id='line_3791'>43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,</a>
<a id='line_3792'>and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the</a>
<a id='line_3793'>land of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3794'></a>
<a id='line_3795'>43:5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the</a>
<a id='line_3796'>forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all</a>
<a id='line_3797'>nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;</a>
<a id='line_3798'>43:6 Even men, and women, and children, and the kingâ€™s daughters, and</a>
<a id='line_3799'>every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with</a>
<a id='line_3800'>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the</a>
<a id='line_3801'>prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.</a>
<a id='line_3802'></a>
<a id='line_3803'>43:7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the</a>
<a id='line_3804'>voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.</a>
<a id='line_3805'></a>
<a id='line_3806'>43:8 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,</a>
<a id='line_3807'>saying, 43:9 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the</a>
<a id='line_3808'>clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaohâ€™s house in</a>
<a id='line_3809'>Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 43:10 And say unto them,</a>
<a id='line_3810'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send</a>
<a id='line_3811'>and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set</a>
<a id='line_3812'>his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his</a>
<a id='line_3813'>royal pavilion over them.</a>
<a id='line_3814'></a>
<a id='line_3815'>43:11 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and</a>
<a id='line_3816'>deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity</a>
<a id='line_3817'>to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.</a>
<a id='line_3818'></a>
<a id='line_3819'>43:12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and</a>
<a id='line_3820'>he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array</a>
<a id='line_3821'>himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment;</a>
<a id='line_3822'>and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</a>
<a id='line_3823'></a>
<a id='line_3824'>43:13 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the</a>
<a id='line_3825'>land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he</a>
<a id='line_3826'>burn with fire.</a>
<a id='line_3827'></a>
<a id='line_3828'>44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which</a>
<a id='line_3829'>dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes,</a>
<a id='line_3830'>and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 44:2 Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_3831'>the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I</a>
<a id='line_3832'>have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and,</a>
<a id='line_3833'>behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,</a>
<a id='line_3834'>44:3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke</a>
<a id='line_3835'>me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other</a>
<a id='line_3836'>gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3837'></a>
<a id='line_3838'>44:4 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising</a>
<a id='line_3839'>early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that</a>
<a id='line_3840'>I hate.</a>
<a id='line_3841'></a>
<a id='line_3842'>44:5 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their</a>
<a id='line_3843'>wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>44:6 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was</a>
<a id='line_3846'>kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and</a>
<a id='line_3847'>they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.</a>
<a id='line_3848'></a>
<a id='line_3849'>44:7 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of</a>
<a id='line_3850'>Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut</a>
<a id='line_3851'>off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave</a>
<a id='line_3852'>you none to remain; 44:8 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the</a>
<a id='line_3853'>works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of</a>
<a id='line_3854'>Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off,</a>
<a id='line_3855'>and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of</a>
<a id='line_3856'>the earth?  44:9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and</a>
<a id='line_3857'>the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their</a>
<a id='line_3858'>wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives,</a>
<a id='line_3859'>which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of</a>
<a id='line_3860'>Jerusalem?  44:10 They are not humbled even unto this day, neither</a>
<a id='line_3861'>have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set</a>
<a id='line_3862'>before you and before your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3863'></a>
<a id='line_3864'>44:11 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;</a>
<a id='line_3865'>Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all</a>
<a id='line_3866'>Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3867'></a>
<a id='line_3868'>44:12 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces</a>
<a id='line_3869'>to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be</a>
<a id='line_3870'>consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed</a>
<a id='line_3871'>by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even</a>
<a id='line_3872'>unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be</a>
<a id='line_3873'>an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</a>
<a id='line_3874'></a>
<a id='line_3875'>44:13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I</a>
<a id='line_3876'>have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the</a>
<a id='line_3877'>pestilence: 44:14 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone</a>
<a id='line_3878'>into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that</a>
<a id='line_3879'>they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a</a>
<a id='line_3880'>desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as</a>
<a id='line_3881'>shall escape.</a>
<a id='line_3882'></a>
<a id='line_3883'>44:15 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense</a>
<a id='line_3884'>unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros,</a>
<a id='line_3886'>answered Jeremiah, saying, 44:16 As for the word that thou hast spoken</a>
<a id='line_3887'>unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_3888'></a>
<a id='line_3889'>44:17 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our</a>
<a id='line_3890'>own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out</a>
<a id='line_3891'>drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our</a>
<a id='line_3892'>kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of</a>
<a id='line_3893'>Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw</a>
<a id='line_3894'>no evil.</a>
<a id='line_3895'></a>
<a id='line_3896'>44:18 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_3897'>and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things,</a>
<a id='line_3898'>and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</a>
<a id='line_3899'></a>
<a id='line_3900'>44:19 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured</a>
<a id='line_3901'>out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her,</a>
<a id='line_3902'>and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?  44:20 Then</a>
<a id='line_3903'>Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and</a>
<a id='line_3904'>to all the people which had given him that answer, saying, 44:21 The</a>
<a id='line_3905'>incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of</a>
<a id='line_3906'>Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the</a>
<a id='line_3907'>people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not</a>
<a id='line_3908'>into his mind?  44:22 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because</a>
<a id='line_3909'>of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye</a>
<a id='line_3910'>have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an</a>
<a id='line_3911'>astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</a>
<a id='line_3912'></a>
<a id='line_3913'>44:23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned</a>
<a id='line_3914'>against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor</a>
<a id='line_3915'>walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies;</a>
<a id='line_3916'>therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</a>
<a id='line_3917'></a>
<a id='line_3918'>44:24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the</a>
<a id='line_3919'>women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of</a>
<a id='line_3920'>Egypt: 44:25 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying;</a>
<a id='line_3921'>Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled</a>
<a id='line_3922'>with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have</a>
<a id='line_3923'>vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink</a>
<a id='line_3924'>offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely</a>
<a id='line_3925'>perform your vows.</a>
<a id='line_3926'></a>
<a id='line_3927'>44:26 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in</a>
<a id='line_3928'>the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the</a>
<a id='line_3929'>LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of</a>
<a id='line_3930'>Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.</a>
<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>44:27 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and</a>
<a id='line_3933'>all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed</a>
<a id='line_3934'>by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</a>
<a id='line_3935'></a>
<a id='line_3936'>44:28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the</a>

<a id='line_3938'>that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know</a>
<a id='line_3939'>whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</a>
<a id='line_3940'></a>
<a id='line_3941'>44:29 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will</a>
<a id='line_3942'>punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely</a>
<a id='line_3943'>stand against you for evil: 44:30 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_3944'>give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and</a>
<a id='line_3945'>into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of</a>
<a id='line_3946'>Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and</a>

<a id='line_4170'>48:28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the</a>
<a id='line_4171'>rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the</a>
<a id='line_4172'>holeâ€™s mouth.</a>
<a id='line_4173'></a>
<a id='line_4174'>48:29 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his</a>
<a id='line_4175'>loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of</a>
<a id='line_4176'>his heart.</a>
<a id='line_4177'></a>
<a id='line_4178'>48:30 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his</a>
<a id='line_4179'>lies shall not so effect it.</a>
<a id='line_4180'></a>
<a id='line_4181'>48:31 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;</a>
<a id='line_4182'>mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.</a>
<a id='line_4183'></a>
<a id='line_4184'>48:32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of</a>
<a id='line_4185'>Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of</a>
<a id='line_4186'>Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy</a>
<a id='line_4187'>vintage.</a>
<a id='line_4188'></a>
<a id='line_4189'>48:33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from</a>
<a id='line_4190'>the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses:</a>
<a id='line_4191'>none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.</a>
<a id='line_4192'></a>
<a id='line_4193'>48:34 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,</a>
<a id='line_4194'>have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an</a>
<a id='line_4195'>heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be</a>
<a id='line_4196'>desolate.</a>
<a id='line_4197'></a>
<a id='line_4198'>48:35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that</a>
<a id='line_4199'>offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</a>
<a id='line_4200'></a>
<a id='line_4201'>48:36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine</a>
<a id='line_4202'>heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the</a>
<a id='line_4203'>riches that he hath gotten are perished.</a>
<a id='line_4204'></a>
<a id='line_4205'>48:37 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all</a>
<a id='line_4206'>the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.</a>
<a id='line_4207'></a>
<a id='line_4208'>48:38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of</a>
<a id='line_4209'>Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel</a>
<a id='line_4210'>wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4211'></a>
<a id='line_4212'>48:39 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab</a>
<a id='line_4213'>turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a</a>
<a id='line_4214'>dismaying to all them about him.</a>
<a id='line_4215'></a>
<a id='line_4216'>48:40 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and</a>
<a id='line_4217'>shall spread his wings over Moab.</a>
<a id='line_4218'></a>
<a id='line_4219'>48:41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the</a>
<a id='line_4220'>mighty menâ€™s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a</a>

<a id='line_4222'></a>
<a id='line_4223'>48:42 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath</a>
<a id='line_4224'>magnified himself against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4225'></a>
<a id='line_4226'>48:43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O</a>
<a id='line_4227'>inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4228'></a>
<a id='line_4229'>48:44 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he</a>
<a id='line_4230'>that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will</a>
<a id='line_4231'>bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the</a>
<a id='line_4232'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4233'></a>
<a id='line_4234'>48:45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the</a>
<a id='line_4235'>force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from</a>
<a id='line_4236'>the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown</a>
<a id='line_4237'>of the head of the tumultuous ones.</a>
<a id='line_4238'></a>
<a id='line_4239'>48:46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for</a>
<a id='line_4240'>thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</a>
<a id='line_4241'></a>
<a id='line_4242'>48:47 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,</a>
<a id='line_4243'>saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_4244'></a>
<a id='line_4245'>49:1 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no</a>
<a id='line_4246'>sons?  hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his</a>
<a id='line_4247'>people dwell in his cities?  49:2 Therefore, behold, the days come,</a>
<a id='line_4248'>saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in</a>
<a id='line_4249'>Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her</a>
<a id='line_4250'>daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto</a>
<a id='line_4251'>them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'>49:3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,</a>
<a id='line_4254'>gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for</a>
<a id='line_4255'>their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes</a>
<a id='line_4256'>together.</a>
<a id='line_4257'></a>
<a id='line_4258'>49:4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O</a>
<a id='line_4259'>backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall</a>
<a id='line_4260'>come unto me?  49:5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the</a>
<a id='line_4261'>Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_4262'>driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that</a>
<a id='line_4263'>wandereth.</a>
<a id='line_4264'></a>
<a id='line_4265'>49:6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of</a>
<a id='line_4266'>Ammon, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4267'></a>
<a id='line_4268'>49:7 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more</a>
<a id='line_4269'>in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom</a>
<a id='line_4270'>vanished?  49:8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_4271'>Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I</a>
<a id='line_4272'>will visit him.</a>
<a id='line_4273'></a>
<a id='line_4274'>49:9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some</a>
<a id='line_4275'>gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have</a>
<a id='line_4276'>enough.</a>
<a id='line_4277'></a>
<a id='line_4278'>49:10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,</a>
<a id='line_4279'>and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his</a>

<a id='line_4281'></a>
<a id='line_4282'>49:11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and</a>
<a id='line_4283'>let thy widows trust in me.</a>
<a id='line_4284'></a>
<a id='line_4285'>49:12 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to</a>
<a id='line_4286'>drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall</a>
<a id='line_4287'>altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_4288'>surely drink of it.</a>
<a id='line_4289'></a>
<a id='line_4290'>49:13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall</a>
<a id='line_4291'>become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the</a>
<a id='line_4292'>cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</a>
<a id='line_4293'></a>
<a id='line_4294'>49:14 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent</a>
<a id='line_4295'>unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her,</a>
<a id='line_4296'>and rise up to the battle.</a>
<a id='line_4297'></a>
<a id='line_4298'>49:15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised</a>
<a id='line_4299'>among men.</a>
<a id='line_4300'></a>
<a id='line_4301'>49:16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine</a>
<a id='line_4302'>heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest</a>
<a id='line_4303'>the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as</a>
<a id='line_4304'>the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4305'></a>
<a id='line_4306'>49:17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it</a>
<a id='line_4307'>shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4308'></a>
<a id='line_4309'>49:18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour</a>
<a id='line_4310'>cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither</a>
<a id='line_4311'>shall a son of man dwell in it.</a>
<a id='line_4312'></a>
<a id='line_4313'>49:19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan</a>
<a id='line_4314'>against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run</a>
<a id='line_4315'>away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?</a>
<a id='line_4316'>for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that</a>
<a id='line_4317'>shepherd that will stand before me?  49:20 Therefore hear the counsel</a>
<a id='line_4318'>of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that</a>
<a id='line_4319'>he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of</a>
<a id='line_4320'>the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations</a>
<a id='line_4321'>desolate with them.</a>
<a id='line_4322'></a>
<a id='line_4323'>49:21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the</a>
<a id='line_4324'>noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_4325'></a>
<a id='line_4326'>49:22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his</a>
<a id='line_4327'>wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men</a>
<a id='line_4328'>of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</a>
<a id='line_4329'></a>
<a id='line_4330'>49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they</a>
<a id='line_4331'>have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the</a>
<a id='line_4332'>sea; it cannot be quiet.</a>
<a id='line_4333'></a>
<a id='line_4334'>49:24 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear</a>

<a id='line_4337'></a>
<a id='line_4338'>49:25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!  49:26</a>
<a id='line_4339'>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of</a>
<a id='line_4340'>war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>

<a id='line_4342'>49:27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall</a>

<a id='line_4348'></a>
<a id='line_4349'>49:29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall</a>
<a id='line_4350'>take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their</a>

<a id='line_4352'></a>
<a id='line_4353'>49:30 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,</a>
<a id='line_4354'>saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel</a>
<a id='line_4355'>against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</a>
<a id='line_4356'></a>
<a id='line_4357'>49:31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without</a>
<a id='line_4358'>care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell</a>
<a id='line_4359'>alone.</a>
<a id='line_4360'></a>
<a id='line_4361'>49:32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their</a>
<a id='line_4362'>cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the</a>
<a id='line_4363'>utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides</a>
<a id='line_4364'>thereof, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4365'></a>
<a id='line_4366'>49:33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for</a>

<a id='line_4368'></a>
<a id='line_4369'>49:34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against</a>
<a id='line_4370'>Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</a>
<a id='line_4371'>49:35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of</a>
<a id='line_4372'>Elam, the chief of their might.</a>
<a id='line_4373'></a>
<a id='line_4374'>49:36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters</a>
<a id='line_4375'>of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there</a>
<a id='line_4376'>shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</a>
<a id='line_4377'></a>
<a id='line_4378'>49:37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and</a>
<a id='line_4379'>before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them,</a>
<a id='line_4380'>even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after</a>
<a id='line_4381'>them, till I have consumed them: 49:38 And I will set my throne in</a>
<a id='line_4382'>Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the</a>
<a id='line_4383'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4384'></a>
<a id='line_4385'>49:39 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring</a>

<a id='line_4388'>50:1 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land</a>

<a id='line_4430'>bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall</a>

<a id='line_4782'>Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of</a>
<a id='line_4783'>Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah</a>
<a id='line_4784'>was a quiet prince.</a>
<a id='line_4785'></a>
<a id='line_4786'>51:60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon</a>
<a id='line_4787'>Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_4788'></a>
<a id='line_4789'>51:61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and</a>
<a id='line_4790'>shalt see, and shalt read all these words; 51:62 Then shalt thou say,</a>
<a id='line_4791'>O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none</a>
<a id='line_4792'>shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be</a>
<a id='line_4793'>desolate for ever.</a>
<a id='line_4794'></a>
<a id='line_4795'>51:63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this</a>
<a id='line_4796'>book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst</a>
<a id='line_4797'>of Euphrates: 51:64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and</a>
<a id='line_4798'>shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they</a>
<a id='line_4799'>shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</a>
<a id='line_4800'></a>
<a id='line_4801'>52:1 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4802'>he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was</a>
<a id='line_4803'>Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</a>
<a id='line_4804'></a>
<a id='line_4805'>52:2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according</a>
<a id='line_4806'>to all that Jehoiakim had done.</a>
<a id='line_4807'></a>
<a id='line_4808'>52:3 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_4809'>and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah</a>
<a id='line_4810'>rebelled against the king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_4811'></a>
<a id='line_4812'>52:4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth</a>
<a id='line_4813'>month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of</a>
<a id='line_4814'>Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched</a>
<a id='line_4815'>against it, and built forts against it round about.</a>
<a id='line_4816'></a>
<a id='line_4817'>52:5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</a>
<a id='line_4818'></a>
<a id='line_4819'>52:6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the</a>
<a id='line_4820'>famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people</a>
<a id='line_4821'>of the land.</a>
<a id='line_4822'></a>
<a id='line_4823'>52:7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and</a>
<a id='line_4824'>went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the</a>
<a id='line_4825'>two walls, which was by the kingâ€™s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by</a>
<a id='line_4826'>the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</a>
<a id='line_4827'></a>
<a id='line_4828'>52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and</a>
<a id='line_4829'>overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was</a>
<a id='line_4830'>scattered from him.</a>
<a id='line_4831'></a>
<a id='line_4832'>52:9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of</a>
<a id='line_4833'>Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon</a>
<a id='line_4834'>him.</a>
<a id='line_4835'></a>
<a id='line_4836'>52:10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his</a>
<a id='line_4837'>eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</a>
<a id='line_4838'></a>
<a id='line_4839'>52:11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon</a>
<a id='line_4840'>bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison</a>
<a id='line_4841'>till the day of his death.</a>
<a id='line_4842'></a>
<a id='line_4843'>52:12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was</a>
<a id='line_4844'>the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came</a>
<a id='line_4845'>Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon,</a>
<a id='line_4846'>into Jerusalem, 52:13 And burned the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_4847'>house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the</a>
<a id='line_4848'>great men, burned he with fire: 52:14 And all the army of the</a>
<a id='line_4849'>Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the</a>
<a id='line_4850'>walls of Jerusalem round about.</a>
<a id='line_4851'></a>
<a id='line_4852'>52:15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive</a>
<a id='line_4853'>certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that</a>
<a id='line_4854'>remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king</a>
<a id='line_4855'>of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</a>
<a id='line_4856'></a>
<a id='line_4857'>52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the</a>
<a id='line_4858'>poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</a>
<a id='line_4859'></a>
<a id='line_4860'>52:17 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4861'>and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4862'>the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_4863'></a>
<a id='line_4864'>52:18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the</a>
<a id='line_4865'>bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they</a>
<a id='line_4866'>ministered, took they away.</a>
<a id='line_4867'></a>
<a id='line_4868'>52:19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the</a>
<a id='line_4869'>caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that</a>
<a id='line_4870'>which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver,</a>
<a id='line_4871'>took the captain of the guard away.</a>
<a id='line_4872'></a>
<a id='line_4873'>52:20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were</a>
<a id='line_4874'>under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_4875'>the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</a>
<a id='line_4876'></a>
<a id='line_4877'>52:21 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was</a>
<a id='line_4878'>eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the</a>
<a id='line_4879'>thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</a>
<a id='line_4880'></a>
<a id='line_4881'>52:22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one</a>
<a id='line_4882'>chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the</a>
<a id='line_4883'>chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the</a>
<a id='line_4884'>pomegranates were like unto these.</a>
<a id='line_4885'></a>
<a id='line_4886'>52:23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all</a>
<a id='line_4887'>the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.</a>
<a id='line_4888'></a>
<a id='line_4889'>52:24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and</a>
<a id='line_4890'>Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 52:25</a>
<a id='line_4891'>He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the</a>
<a id='line_4892'>men of war; and seven men of them that were near the kingâ€™s person,</a>
<a id='line_4893'>which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host,</a>
<a id='line_4894'>who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people</a>
<a id='line_4895'>of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</a>
<a id='line_4896'></a>
<a id='line_4897'>52:26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought</a>
<a id='line_4898'>them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</a>
<a id='line_4899'></a>
<a id='line_4900'>52:27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in</a>
<a id='line_4901'>Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out</a>
<a id='line_4902'>of his own land.</a>
<a id='line_4903'></a>
<a id='line_4904'>52:28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in</a>
<a id='line_4905'>the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 52:29 In</a>
<a id='line_4906'>the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from</a>
<a id='line_4907'>Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 52:30 In the three and</a>
<a id='line_4908'>twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard</a>
<a id='line_4909'>carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons:</a>
<a id='line_4910'>all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</a>
<a id='line_4911'></a>
<a id='line_4912'>52:31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the</a>
<a id='line_4913'>captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the</a>
<a id='line_4914'>five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon</a>
<a id='line_4915'>in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king</a>
<a id='line_4916'>of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_4917'></a>
<a id='line_4918'>52:32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne</a>
<a id='line_4919'>of the kings that were with him in Babylon, 52:33 And changed his</a>
<a id='line_4920'>prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the</a>
<a id='line_4921'>days of his life.</a>
<a id='line_4922'></a>
<a id='line_4923'>52:34 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the</a>
<a id='line_4924'>king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all</a>
<a id='line_4925'>the days of his life.</a>

<a id='line_4930'>The Lamentations of Jeremiah</a>
<a id='line_4931'></a>
<a id='line_4932'></a>
<a id='line_4933'>1:1 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is</a>
<a id='line_4934'>she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and</a>
<a id='line_4935'>princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!  1:2 She</a>
<a id='line_4936'>weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all</a>
<a id='line_4937'>her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt</a>
<a id='line_4938'>treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</a>
<a id='line_4939'></a>
<a id='line_4940'>1:3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of</a>
<a id='line_4941'>great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest:</a>
<a id='line_4942'>all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</a>
<a id='line_4943'></a>
<a id='line_4944'>1:4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts:</a>
<a id='line_4945'>all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are</a>
<a id='line_4946'>afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</a>
<a id='line_4947'></a>
<a id='line_4948'>1:5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4949'>hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her</a>
<a id='line_4950'>children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_4951'></a>
<a id='line_4952'>1:6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her</a>
<a id='line_4953'>princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone</a>

<a id='line_4955'></a>
<a id='line_4956'>1:7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her</a>
<a id='line_4957'>miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when</a>
<a id='line_4958'>her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the</a>
<a id='line_4959'>adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</a>
<a id='line_4960'></a>
<a id='line_4961'>1:8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all</a>
<a id='line_4962'>that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:</a>

<a id='line_4964'></a>
<a id='line_4965'>1:9 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;</a>

<a id='line_4968'></a>
<a id='line_4969'>1:10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant</a>

<a id='line_4973'></a>
<a id='line_4974'>1:11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their</a>

<a id='line_4986'>1:14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are</a>

<a id='line_5008'>1:19 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine</a>

<a id='line_5085'></a>
<a id='line_5086'>2:15 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag</a>

<a id='line_5089'>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and</a>

<a id='line_5093'>2:17 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled</a>
<a id='line_5094'>his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown</a>
<a id='line_5095'>down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice</a>
<a id='line_5096'>over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</a>
<a id='line_5097'></a>
<a id='line_5098'>2:18 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion,</a>

<a id='line_5113'></a>
<a id='line_5114'>2:22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so</a>

<a id='line_5145'></a>
<a id='line_5146'>3:12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</a>
