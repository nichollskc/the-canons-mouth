<a id='line_133'>        two of TITUS' sons; and then two men bearing a coffin covered</a>
<a id='line_134'>        with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS, two other sons; then TITUS</a>

<a id='line_190'>    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</a>

<a id='line_588'>    By my advice, all humbled on your knees,</a>
<a id='line_589'>    You shall ask pardon of his Majesty.</a>
<a id='line_590'>  LUCIUS. We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness</a>
<a id='line_591'>    That what we did was mildly as we might,</a>
<a id='line_592'>    Tend'ring our sister's honour and our own.</a>

<a id='line_594'>  SATURNINUS. Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.</a>
<a id='line_595'>  TAMORA. Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.</a>
<a id='line_596'>    The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.</a>
<a id='line_597'>    I will not be denied. Sweet heart, look back.</a>
<a id='line_598'>  SATURNINUS. Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother's here,</a>
<a id='line_599'>    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,</a>
<a id='line_600'>    I do remit these young men's heinous faults.</a>
<a id='line_601'>    Stand up.</a>
<a id='line_602'>    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,</a>
<a id='line_603'>    I found a friend; and sure as death I swore</a>
<a id='line_604'>    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.</a>
<a id='line_605'>    Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides,</a>

<a id='line_607'>    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.</a>
<a id='line_608'>  TITUS. To-morrow, and it please your Majesty</a>
<a id='line_609'>    To hunt the panther and the hart with me,</a>
<a id='line_610'>    With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bonjour.</a>

<a id='line_635'>    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!</a>
<a id='line_636'>    I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,</a>
<a id='line_637'>    To wait upon this new-made emperess.</a>
<a id='line_638'>    To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,</a>

<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>            Enter CHIRON and DEMETRIUS, braving</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>  DEMETRIUS. Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge</a>
<a id='line_647'>    And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,</a>
<a id='line_648'>    And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.</a>
<a id='line_649'>  CHIRON. Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;</a>

<a id='line_651'>    'Tis not the difference of a year or two</a>
<a id='line_652'>    Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:</a>

<a id='line_655'>    And that my sword upon thee shall approve,</a>
<a id='line_656'>    And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.</a>
<a id='line_657'>  AARON.  [Aside]  Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the</a>

<a id='line_659'>  DEMETRIUS. Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,</a>
<a id='line_660'>    Gave you a dancing rapier by your side,</a>
<a id='line_661'>    Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?</a>
<a id='line_662'>    Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath</a>
<a id='line_663'>    Till you know better how to handle it.</a>
<a id='line_664'>  CHIRON. Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,</a>
<a id='line_665'>    Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.</a>
<a id='line_666'>  DEMETRIUS. Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?              [They draw]</a>
<a id='line_667'>  AARON.  [Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!</a>
<a id='line_668'>    So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw</a>
<a id='line_669'>    And maintain such a quarrel openly?</a>
<a id='line_670'>    Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:</a>
<a id='line_671'>    I would not for a million of gold</a>
<a id='line_672'>    The cause were known to them it most concerns;</a>
<a id='line_673'>    Nor would your noble mother for much more</a>
<a id='line_674'>    Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_675'>    For shame, put up.</a>
<a id='line_676'>  DEMETRIUS. Not I, till I have sheath'd</a>
<a id='line_677'>    My rapier in his bosom, and withal</a>
<a id='line_678'>    Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat</a>
<a id='line_679'>    That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here.</a>
<a id='line_680'>  CHIRON. For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd,</a>
<a id='line_681'>    Foul-spoken coward, that thund'rest with thy tongue,</a>
<a id='line_682'>    And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform.</a>
<a id='line_683'>  AARON. Away, I say!</a>
<a id='line_684'>    Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,</a>
<a id='line_685'>    This pretty brabble will undo us all.</a>
<a id='line_686'>    Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous</a>
<a id='line_687'>    It is to jet upon a prince's right?</a>
<a id='line_688'>    What, is Lavinia then become so loose,</a>
<a id='line_689'>    Or Bassianus so degenerate,</a>
<a id='line_690'>    That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd</a>
<a id='line_691'>    Without controlment, justice, or revenge?</a>
<a id='line_692'>    Young lords, beware; an should the Empress know</a>
<a id='line_693'>    This discord's ground, the music would not please.</a>
<a id='line_694'>  CHIRON. I care not, I, knew she and all the world:</a>
<a id='line_695'>    I love Lavinia more than all the world.</a>
<a id='line_696'>  DEMETRIUS. Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:</a>
<a id='line_697'>    Lavina is thine elder brother's hope.</a>
<a id='line_698'>  AARON. Why, are ye mad, or know ye not in Rome</a>
<a id='line_699'>    How furious and impatient they be,</a>
<a id='line_700'>    And cannot brook competitors in love?</a>
<a id='line_701'>    I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths</a>
<a id='line_702'>    By this device.</a>
<a id='line_703'>  CHIRON. Aaron, a thousand deaths</a>
<a id='line_704'>    Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.</a>
<a id='line_705'>  AARON. To achieve her- how?</a>
<a id='line_706'>  DEMETRIUS. Why mak'st thou it so strange?</a>
<a id='line_707'>    She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;</a>
<a id='line_708'>    She is a woman, therefore may be won;</a>
<a id='line_709'>    She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.</a>
<a id='line_710'>    What, man! more water glideth by the mill</a>
<a id='line_711'>    Than wots the miller of; and easy it is</a>
<a id='line_712'>    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.</a>
<a id='line_713'>    Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother,</a>
<a id='line_714'>    Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.</a>
<a id='line_715'>  AARON.  [Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.</a>
<a id='line_716'>  DEMETRIUS. Then why should he despair that knows to court it</a>
<a id='line_717'>    With words, fair looks, and liberality?</a>
<a id='line_718'>    What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,</a>
<a id='line_719'>    And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?</a>
<a id='line_720'>  AARON. Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so</a>
<a id='line_721'>    Would serve your turns.</a>
<a id='line_722'>  CHIRON. Ay, so the turn were served.</a>
<a id='line_723'>  DEMETRIUS. Aaron, thou hast hit it.</a>
<a id='line_724'>  AARON. Would you had hit it too!</a>
<a id='line_725'>    Then should not we be tir'd with this ado.</a>
<a id='line_726'>    Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools</a>
<a id='line_727'>    To square for this? Would it offend you, then,</a>
<a id='line_728'>    That both should speed?</a>
<a id='line_729'>  CHIRON. Faith, not me.</a>
<a id='line_730'>  DEMETRIUS. Nor me, so I were one.</a>
<a id='line_731'>  AARON. For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.</a>
<a id='line_732'>    'Tis policy and stratagem must do</a>
<a id='line_733'>    That you affect; and so must you resolve</a>
<a id='line_734'>    That what you cannot as you would achieve,</a>
<a id='line_735'>    You must perforce accomplish as you may.</a>
<a id='line_736'>    Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste</a>
<a id='line_737'>    Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.</a>
<a id='line_738'>    A speedier course than ling'ring languishment</a>
<a id='line_739'>    Must we pursue, and I have found the path.</a>
<a id='line_740'>    My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</a>
<a id='line_741'>    There will the lovely Roman ladies troop;</a>
<a id='line_742'>    The forest walks are wide and spacious,</a>
<a id='line_743'>    And many unfrequented plots there are</a>
<a id='line_744'>    Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.</a>
<a id='line_745'>    Single you thither then this dainty doe,</a>
<a id='line_746'>    And strike her home by force if not by words.</a>
<a id='line_747'>    This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</a>
<a id='line_748'>    Come, come, our Empress, with her sacred wit</a>
<a id='line_749'>    To villainy and vengeance consecrate,</a>
<a id='line_750'>    Will we acquaint with all what we intend;</a>
<a id='line_751'>    And she shall file our engines with advice</a>
<a id='line_752'>    That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</a>
<a id='line_753'>    But to your wishes' height advance you both.</a>
<a id='line_754'>    The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame,</a>
<a id='line_755'>    The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;</a>
<a id='line_756'>    The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.</a>
<a id='line_757'>    There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;</a>
<a id='line_758'>    There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven's eye,</a>
<a id='line_759'>    And revel in Lavinia's treasury.</a>
<a id='line_760'>  CHIRON. Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.</a>
<a id='line_761'>  DEMETRIUS. Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream</a>
<a id='line_762'>    To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,</a>
<a id='line_763'>    Per Styga, per manes vehor.                           Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_775'>    That all the court may echo with the noise.</a>
<a id='line_776'>    Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,</a>

<a id='line_790'>  LAVINIA. I say no;</a>
<a id='line_791'>    I have been broad awake two hours and more.</a>
<a id='line_792'>  SATURNINUS. Come on then, horse and chariots let us have,</a>

<a id='line_794'>    Our Roman hunting.</a>
<a id='line_795'>  MARCUS. I have dogs, my lord,</a>

<a id='line_2265'>    And as I earnestly did fix mine eye</a>
<a id='line_2266'>    Upon the wasted building, suddenly</a>
<a id='line_2267'>    I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</a>
<a id='line_2268'>    I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</a>
<a id='line_2269'>    The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:</a>
<a id='line_2270'>    'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</a>
<a id='line_2271'>    Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</a>
<a id='line_2272'>    Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,</a>
<a id='line_2273'>    Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor;</a>
<a id='line_2274'>    But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</a>
<a id='line_2275'>    They never do beget a coal-black calf.</a>
<a id='line_2276'>    Peace, villain, peace!'- even thus he rates the babe-</a>
<a id='line_2277'>    'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,</a>
<a id='line_2278'>    Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe,</a>
<a id='line_2279'>    Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'</a>
<a id='line_2280'>    With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,</a>
<a id='line_2281'>    Surpris'd him suddenly, and brought him hither</a>
<a id='line_2282'>    To use as you think needful of the man.</a>
<a id='line_2283'>  LUCIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</a>
<a id='line_2284'>    That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;</a>
<a id='line_2285'>    This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye;</a>
<a id='line_2286'>    And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.</a>
<a id='line_2287'>    Say, wall-ey'd slave, whither wouldst thou convey</a>
<a id='line_2288'>    This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</a>
<a id='line_2289'>    Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?</a>
<a id='line_2290'>    A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,</a>
<a id='line_2291'>    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</a>
<a id='line_2292'>  AARON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.</a>
<a id='line_2293'>  LUCIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good.</a>
<a id='line_2294'>    First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl-</a>
<a id='line_2295'>    A sight to vex the father's soul withal.</a>
<a id='line_2296'>    Get me a ladder.</a>
<a id='line_2297'>                [A ladder brought, which AARON is made to climb]</a>
<a id='line_2298'>  AARON. Lucius, save the child,</a>
<a id='line_2299'>    And bear it from me to the Emperess.</a>
<a id='line_2300'>    If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things</a>
<a id='line_2301'>    That highly may advantage thee to hear;</a>
<a id='line_2302'>    If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</a>
<a id='line_2303'>    I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'</a>
<a id='line_2304'>  LUCIUS. Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,</a>
<a id='line_2305'>    Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.</a>
<a id='line_2306'>  AARON. An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,</a>
<a id='line_2307'>    'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</a>
<a id='line_2308'>    For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,</a>
<a id='line_2309'>    Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</a>
<a id='line_2310'>    Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,</a>
<a id='line_2311'>    Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd;</a>
<a id='line_2312'>    And this shall all be buried in my death,</a>
<a id='line_2313'>    Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</a>
<a id='line_2314'>  LUCIUS. Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</a>
<a id='line_2315'>  AARON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</a>
<a id='line_2316'>  LUCIUS. Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;</a>
<a id='line_2317'>    That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</a>
<a id='line_2318'>  AARON. What if I do not? as indeed I do not;</a>
<a id='line_2319'>    Yet, for I know thou art religious</a>
<a id='line_2320'>    And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</a>
<a id='line_2321'>    With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies</a>
<a id='line_2322'>    Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</a>
<a id='line_2323'>    Therefore I urge thy oath. For that I know</a>
<a id='line_2324'>    An idiot holds his bauble for a god,</a>
<a id='line_2325'>    And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</a>
<a id='line_2326'>    To that I'll urge him. Therefore thou shalt vow</a>
<a id='line_2327'>    By that same god- what god soe'er it be</a>
<a id='line_2328'>    That thou adorest and hast in reverence-</a>
<a id='line_2329'>    To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;</a>
<a id='line_2330'>    Or else I will discover nought to thee.</a>
<a id='line_2331'>  LUCIUS. Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</a>
<a id='line_2332'>  AARON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.</a>
<a id='line_2333'>  LUCIUS. O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</a>
<a id='line_2334'>  AARON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</a>
<a id='line_2335'>    To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</a>
<a id='line_2336'>    'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;</a>
<a id='line_2337'>    They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravish'd her,</a>
<a id='line_2338'>    And cut her hands, and trimm'd her as thou sawest.</a>
<a id='line_2339'>  LUCIUS. O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?</a>
<a id='line_2340'>  AARON. Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas</a>
<a id='line_2341'>    Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.</a>
<a id='line_2342'>  LUCIUS. O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!</a>
<a id='line_2343'>  AARON. Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.</a>
<a id='line_2344'>    That codding spirit had they from their mother,</a>
<a id='line_2345'>    As sure a card as ever won the set;</a>
<a id='line_2346'>    That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,</a>
<a id='line_2347'>    As true a dog as ever fought at head.</a>
<a id='line_2348'>    Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</a>
<a id='line_2349'>    I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole</a>
<a id='line_2350'>    Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;</a>
<a id='line_2351'>    I wrote the letter that thy father found,</a>
<a id='line_2352'>    And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,</a>
<a id='line_2353'>    Confederate with the Queen and her two sons;</a>
<a id='line_2354'>    And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</a>
<a id='line_2355'>    Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</a>
<a id='line_2356'>    I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,</a>
<a id='line_2357'>    And, when I had it, drew myself apart</a>
<a id='line_2358'>    And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</a>
<a id='line_2359'>    I pried me through the crevice of a wall,</a>
<a id='line_2360'>    When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;</a>
<a id='line_2361'>    Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily</a>
<a id='line_2362'>    That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;</a>
<a id='line_2363'>    And when I told the Empress of this sport,</a>
<a id='line_2364'>    She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,</a>
<a id='line_2365'>    And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</a>
<a id='line_2366'>  GOTH. What, canst thou say all this and never blush?</a>
<a id='line_2367'>  AARON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</a>
<a id='line_2368'>  LUCIUS. Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</a>
<a id='line_2369'>  AARON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</a>
<a id='line_2370'>    Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think,</a>
<a id='line_2371'>    Few come within the compass of my curse-</a>
<a id='line_2372'>    Wherein I did not some notorious ill;</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    As kill a man, or else devise his death;</a>
<a id='line_2374'>    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;</a>
<a id='line_2375'>    Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    Set deadly enmity between two friends;</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    Make poor men's cattle break their necks;</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    And set them upright at their dear friends' door</a>
<a id='line_2382'>    Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    Have with my knife carved in Roman letters</a>
<a id='line_2385'>    'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'</a>
<a id='line_2386'>    Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    As willingly as one would kill a fly;</a>
<a id='line_2388'>    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</a>
<a id='line_2389'>    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</a>
<a id='line_2390'>  LUCIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die</a>
<a id='line_2391'>    So sweet a death as hanging presently.</a>
<a id='line_2392'>  AARON. If there be devils, would I were a devil,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>    To live and burn in everlasting fire,</a>
<a id='line_2394'>    So I might have your company in hell</a>
<a id='line_2395'>    But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</a>
<a id='line_2396'>  LUCIUS. Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.</a>
<a id='line_2397'></a>
<a id='line_2398'>                       Enter AEMILIUS</a>
<a id='line_2399'></a>
<a id='line_2400'>  GOTH. My lord, there is a messenger from Rome</a>
<a id='line_2401'>    Desires to be admitted to your presence.</a>
<a id='line_2402'>  LUCIUS. Let him come near.</a>
<a id='line_2403'>    Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome?</a>
<a id='line_2404'>  AEMILIUS. Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths,</a>
<a id='line_2405'>    The Roman Emperor greets you all by me;</a>
<a id='line_2406'>    And, for he understands you are in arms,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>    He craves a parley at your father's house,</a>
<a id='line_2408'>    Willing you to demand your hostages,</a>
<a id='line_2409'>    And they shall be immediately deliver'd.</a>
<a id='line_2410'>  FIRST GOTH. What says our general?</a>
<a id='line_2411'>  LUCIUS. Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges</a>
<a id='line_2412'>    Unto my father and my uncle Marcus.</a>
<a id='line_2413'>    And we will come. March away.                         Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_2414'></a>
<a id='line_2415'>SCENE II. Rome. Before TITUS' house</a>
<a id='line_2416'></a>
<a id='line_2417'>Enter TAMORA, and her two sons, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, disguised</a>

<a id='line_2419'>  TAMORA. Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,</a>
<a id='line_2420'>    I will encounter with Andronicus,</a>

<a id='line_2434'>    You are deceiv'd; for what I mean to do</a>

<a id='line_2437'>  TAMORA. Titus, I am come to talk with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2438'>  TITUS. No, not a word. How can I grace my talk,</a>
<a id='line_2439'>    Wanting a hand to give it that accord?</a>
<a id='line_2440'>    Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.</a>
<a id='line_2441'>  TAMORA. If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.</a>
<a id='line_2442'>  TITUS. I am not mad, I know thee well enough:</a>
<a id='line_2443'>    Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;</a>
<a id='line_2444'>    Witness these trenches made by grief and care;</a>
<a id='line_2445'>    Witness the tiring day and heavy night;</a>
<a id='line_2446'>    Witness all sorrow that I know thee well</a>

<a id='line_2454'>    Come down and welcome me to this world's light;</a>
<a id='line_2455'>    Confer with me of murder and of death;</a>
<a id='line_2456'>    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,</a>

<a id='line_2470'>    And whirl along with thee about the globes.</a>
<a id='line_2471'>    Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,</a>

<a id='line_2473'>    And find out murderers in their guilty caves;</a>
<a id='line_2474'>    And when thy car is loaden with their heads,</a>
<a id='line_2475'>    I will dismount, and by thy waggon wheel</a>
<a id='line_2476'>    Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,</a>
<a id='line_2477'>    Even from Hyperion's rising in the east</a>
<a id='line_2478'>    Until his very downfall in the sea.</a>
<a id='line_2479'>    And day by day I'll do this heavy task,</a>

<a id='line_2482'>  TITUS. Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?</a>
<a id='line_2483'>  TAMORA. Rape and Murder; therefore called so</a>
<a id='line_2484'>    'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.</a>
<a id='line_2485'>  TITUS. Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are!</a>

<a id='line_2488'>    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;</a>
<a id='line_2489'>    And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,</a>
<a id='line_2490'>    I will embrace thee in it by and by.</a>
<a id='line_2491'>  TAMORA. This closing with him fits his lunacy.</a>
<a id='line_2492'>    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,</a>
<a id='line_2493'>    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,</a>
<a id='line_2494'>    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;</a>
<a id='line_2495'>    And, being credulous in this mad thought,</a>
<a id='line_2496'>    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,</a>

<a id='line_2498'>    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand</a>
<a id='line_2499'>    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,</a>
<a id='line_2500'>    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_2501'>    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.</a>
<a id='line_2502'></a>
<a id='line_2503'>                 Enter TITUS, below</a>

<a id='line_2514'>    It were convenient you had such a devil.</a>
<a id='line_2515'>    But welcome as you are. What shall we do?</a>
<a id='line_2516'>  TAMORA. What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?</a>
<a id='line_2517'>  DEMETRIUS. Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.</a>
<a id='line_2518'>  CHIRON. Show me a villain that hath done a rape,</a>

<a id='line_2520'>  TAMORA. Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,</a>
<a id='line_2521'>    And I will be revenged on them all.</a>
<a id='line_2522'>  TITUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_2523'>    And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,</a>
<a id='line_2524'>    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.</a>
<a id='line_2525'>    Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap</a>
<a id='line_2526'>    To find another that is like to thee,</a>
<a id='line_2527'>    Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.</a>
<a id='line_2528'>    Go thou with them; and in the Emperor's court</a>
<a id='line_2529'>    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;</a>
<a id='line_2530'>    Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,</a>
<a id='line_2531'>    For up and down she doth resemble thee.</a>
<a id='line_2532'>    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;</a>
<a id='line_2533'>    They have been violent to me and mine.</a>
<a id='line_2534'>  TAMORA. Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.</a>
<a id='line_2535'>    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,</a>
<a id='line_2536'>    To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,</a>
<a id='line_2537'>    Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,</a>
<a id='line_2538'>    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;</a>
<a id='line_2539'>    When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,</a>
<a id='line_2540'>    I will bring in the Empress and her sons,</a>

<a id='line_2544'>    What says Andronicus to this device?</a>
<a id='line_2545'>  TITUS. Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.</a>

<a id='line_2822'>    These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,</a>
<a id='line_2823'>    The last true duties of thy noble son!</a>
<a id='line_2824'>  MARCUS. Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss</a>
<a id='line_2825'>    Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.</a>
<a id='line_2826'>    O, were the sum of these that I should pay</a>
<a id='line_2827'>    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!</a>
<a id='line_2828'>  LUCIUS. Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us</a>
<a id='line_2829'>    To melt in showers. Thy grandsire lov'd thee well;</a>
<a id='line_2830'>    Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>    Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;</a>
<a id='line_2832'>    Many a story hath he told to thee,</a>
<a id='line_2833'>    And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind</a>
<a id='line_2834'>    And talk of them when he was dead and gone.</a>
<a id='line_2835'>  MARCUS. How many thousand times hath these poor lips,</a>
<a id='line_2836'>    When they were living, warm'd themselves on thine!</a>
<a id='line_2837'>    O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss!</a>
<a id='line_2838'>    Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;</a>
<a id='line_2839'>    Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.</a>
<a id='line_2840'>  BOY. O grandsire, grandsire! ev'n with all my heart</a>
<a id='line_2841'>    Would I were dead, so you did live again!</a>
<a id='line_2842'>    O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;</a>
<a id='line_2843'>    My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2844'></a>
<a id='line_2845'>            Re-enter attendants with AARON</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'>  A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;</a>
<a id='line_2848'>    Give sentence on the execrable wretch</a>
<a id='line_2849'>    That hath been breeder of these dire events.</a>
<a id='line_2850'>  LUCIUS. Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;</a>
<a id='line_2851'>    There let him stand and rave and cry for food.</a>
<a id='line_2852'>    If any one relieves or pities him,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>    For the offence he dies. This is our doom.</a>
<a id='line_2854'>    Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2855'>  AARON. Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?</a>
<a id='line_2856'>    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers</a>
<a id='line_2857'>    I should repent the evils I have done;</a>
<a id='line_2858'>    Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did</a>
<a id='line_2859'>    Would I perform, if I might have my will.</a>
<a id='line_2860'>    If one good deed in all my life I did,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>    I do repent it from my very soul.</a>
<a id='line_2862'>  LUCIUS. Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,</a>
<a id='line_2863'>    And give him burial in his father's grave.</a>
<a id='line_2864'>    My father and Lavinia shall forthwith</a>
<a id='line_2865'>    Be closed in our household's monument.</a>
<a id='line_2866'>    As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,</a>
<a id='line_2867'>    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,</a>
<a id='line_2868'>    No mournful bell shall ring her burial;</a>
<a id='line_2869'>    But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.</a>
<a id='line_2870'>    Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,</a>
<a id='line_2871'>    And being dead, let birds on her take pity.           Exeunt</a>
