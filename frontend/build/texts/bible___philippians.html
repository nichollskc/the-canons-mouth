                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the</a>
<a id='line_4'>saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and</a>
<a id='line_5'>deacons: 1:2 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and</a>
<a id='line_6'>from the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 1:4 Always in every</a>
<a id='line_9'>prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 1:5 For your</a>
<a id='line_10'>fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 1:6 Being</a>
<a id='line_11'>confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in</a>
<a id='line_12'>you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 1:7 Even as it is</a>
<a id='line_13'>meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart;</a>
<a id='line_14'>inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of</a>
<a id='line_15'>the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the</a>
<a id='line_18'>bowels of Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in</a>
<a id='line_21'>knowledge and in all judgment; 1:10 That ye may approve things that</a>
<a id='line_22'>are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day</a>
<a id='line_23'>of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus</a>
<a id='line_26'>Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which</a>
<a id='line_29'>happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the</a>
<a id='line_30'>gospel; 1:13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the</a>
<a id='line_31'>palace, and in all other places; 1:14 And many of the brethren in the</a>
<a id='line_32'>Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the</a>
<a id='line_33'>word without fear.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also</a>
<a id='line_36'>of good will: 1:16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely,</a>
<a id='line_37'>supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 1:17 But the other of love,</a>
<a id='line_38'>knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in</a>
<a id='line_41'>truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will</a>
<a id='line_42'>rejoice.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your</a>
<a id='line_45'>prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 1:20 According</a>
<a id='line_46'>to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be</a>
<a id='line_47'>ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ</a>
<a id='line_48'>shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet</a>
<a id='line_53'>what I shall choose I wot not.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and</a>
<a id='line_56'>to be with Christ; which is far better: 1:24 Nevertheless to abide in</a>
<a id='line_57'>the flesh is more needful for you.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and</a>
<a id='line_60'>continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 1:26 That</a>
<a id='line_61'>your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my</a>
<a id='line_62'>coming to you again.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of</a>
<a id='line_65'>Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear</a>
<a id='line_66'>of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind</a>
<a id='line_67'>striving together for the faith of the gospel; 1:28 And in nothing</a>
<a id='line_68'>terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of</a>
<a id='line_69'>perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to</a>
<a id='line_72'>believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 1:30 Having the same</a>
<a id='line_73'>conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of</a>
<a id='line_76'>love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 2:2</a>
<a id='line_77'>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being</a>
<a id='line_78'>of one accord, of one mind.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>2:3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness</a>
<a id='line_81'>of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the</a>
<a id='line_84'>things of others.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 2:6 Who,</a>
<a id='line_87'>being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</a>
<a id='line_88'>2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a</a>
<a id='line_89'>servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 2:8 And being found in</a>
<a id='line_90'>fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,</a>
<a id='line_91'>even the death of the cross.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name</a>
<a id='line_94'>which is above every name: 2:10 That at the name of Jesus every knee</a>
<a id='line_95'>should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under</a>
<a id='line_96'>the earth; 2:11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ</a>
<a id='line_97'>is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my</a>
<a id='line_100'>presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own</a>
<a id='line_101'>salvation with fear and trembling.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his</a>
<a id='line_104'>good pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 2:15 That ye may</a>
<a id='line_107'>be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the</a>
<a id='line_108'>midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights</a>
<a id='line_109'>in the world; 2:16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice</a>
<a id='line_110'>in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in</a>
<a id='line_111'>vain.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>2:17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your</a>
<a id='line_114'>faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>2:18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,</a>
<a id='line_119'>that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your</a>
<a id='line_122'>state.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>2:21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>2:22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he</a>
<a id='line_127'>hath served with me in the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>2:23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see</a>
<a id='line_130'>how it will go with me.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>2:24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>2:25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my</a>
<a id='line_135'>brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your</a>
<a id='line_136'>messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>2:26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because</a>
<a id='line_139'>that ye had heard that he had been sick.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>2:27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him;</a>
<a id='line_142'>and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon</a>
<a id='line_143'>sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>2:28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him</a>
<a id='line_146'>again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold</a>
<a id='line_149'>such in reputation: 2:30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh</a>
<a id='line_150'>unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service</a>
<a id='line_151'>toward me.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same</a>
<a id='line_154'>things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>3:3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and</a>
<a id='line_159'>rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>3:4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man</a>
<a id='line_162'>thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 3:5</a>
<a id='line_163'>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of</a>
<a id='line_164'>Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</a>
<a id='line_165'>3:6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the</a>
<a id='line_166'>righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency</a>
<a id='line_171'>of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the</a>
<a id='line_172'>loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</a>
<a id='line_173'>3:9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is</a>
<a id='line_174'>of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the</a>
<a id='line_175'>righteousness which is of God by faith: 3:10 That I may know him, and</a>
<a id='line_176'>the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,</a>
<a id='line_177'>being made conformable unto his death; 3:11 If by any means I might</a>
<a id='line_178'>attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>3:12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already</a>
<a id='line_181'>perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which</a>
<a id='line_182'>also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>3:13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one</a>
<a id='line_185'>thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching</a>
<a id='line_186'>forth unto those things which are before, 3:14 I press toward the mark</a>
<a id='line_187'>for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>3:15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if</a>
<a id='line_190'>in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto</a>
<a id='line_191'>you.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>3:16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by</a>
<a id='line_194'>the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>3:17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk</a>
<a id='line_197'>so as ye have us for an ensample.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>3:18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you</a>
<a id='line_200'>even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 3:19</a>
<a id='line_201'>Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is</a>
<a id='line_202'>in their shame, who mind earthly things.)  3:20 For our conversation</a>
<a id='line_203'>is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_204'>Christ: 3:21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned</a>
<a id='line_205'>like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is</a>
<a id='line_206'>able even to subdue all things unto himself.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>4:1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and</a>
<a id='line_209'>crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>4:2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same</a>
<a id='line_212'>mind in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>4:3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which</a>
<a id='line_215'>laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my</a>
<a id='line_216'>fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>4:4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and</a>
<a id='line_223'>supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto</a>
<a id='line_224'>God.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep</a>
<a id='line_227'>your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>4:8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things</a>
<a id='line_230'>are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,</a>
<a id='line_231'>whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if</a>
<a id='line_232'>there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these</a>
<a id='line_233'>things.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>4:9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,</a>
<a id='line_236'>and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>4:10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your</a>
<a id='line_239'>care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye</a>
<a id='line_240'>lacked opportunity.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in</a>
<a id='line_243'>whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>4:12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every</a>
<a id='line_246'>where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be</a>
<a id='line_247'>hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>4:14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with</a>
<a id='line_252'>my affliction.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>4:15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_255'>gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me</a>
<a id='line_256'>as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>4:16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my</a>
<a id='line_259'>necessity.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound</a>
<a id='line_262'>to your account.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>4:18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of</a>
<a id='line_265'>Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet</a>
<a id='line_266'>smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>4:19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in</a>
<a id='line_269'>glory by Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>4:20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>4:21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with</a>
<a id='line_274'>me greet you.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>4:22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s</a>
<a id='line_277'>household.</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>4:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</a>
