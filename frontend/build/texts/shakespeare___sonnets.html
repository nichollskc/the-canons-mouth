<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</a>
<a id='line_5'>That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,</a>
<a id='line_6'>But as the riper should by time decease,</a>
<a id='line_7'>His tender heir might bear his memory:</a>
<a id='line_8'>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</a>
<a id='line_9'>Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,</a>
<a id='line_10'>Making a famine where abundance lies,</a>
<a id='line_11'>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</a>
<a id='line_12'>Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,</a>
<a id='line_13'>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</a>
<a id='line_14'>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</a>
<a id='line_15'>And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:</a>
<a id='line_16'>  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</a>
<a id='line_17'>  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>

<a id='line_20'>                    2</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</a>
<a id='line_23'>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,</a>
<a id='line_24'>Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,</a>
<a id='line_25'>Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:</a>
<a id='line_26'>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,</a>
<a id='line_27'>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;</a>
<a id='line_28'>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,</a>
<a id='line_29'>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</a>
<a id='line_30'>How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,</a>
<a id='line_31'>If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine</a>
<a id='line_32'>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’</a>
<a id='line_33'>Proving his beauty by succession thine.</a>
<a id='line_34'>  This were to be new made when thou art old,</a>
<a id='line_35'>  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>

<a id='line_38'>                    3</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,</a>
<a id='line_41'>Now is the time that face should form another,</a>
<a id='line_42'>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</a>
<a id='line_43'>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</a>
<a id='line_44'>For where is she so fair whose uneared womb</a>
<a id='line_45'>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</a>
<a id='line_46'>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb</a>
<a id='line_47'>Of his self-love to stop posterity?</a>
<a id='line_48'>Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee</a>
<a id='line_49'>Calls back the lovely April of her prime,</a>
<a id='line_50'>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</a>
<a id='line_51'>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</a>
<a id='line_52'>  But if thou live remembered not to be,</a>
<a id='line_53'>  Die single and thine image dies with thee.</a>

<a id='line_56'>                    4</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,</a>
<a id='line_59'>Upon thy self thy beauty’s legacy?</a>
<a id='line_60'>Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,</a>
<a id='line_61'>And being frank she lends to those are free:</a>
<a id='line_62'>Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,</a>
<a id='line_63'>The bounteous largess given thee to give?</a>
<a id='line_64'>Profitless usurer why dost thou use</a>
<a id='line_65'>So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?</a>
<a id='line_66'>For having traffic with thy self alone,</a>
<a id='line_67'>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,</a>
<a id='line_68'>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,</a>
<a id='line_69'>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</a>
<a id='line_70'>  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,</a>
<a id='line_71'>  Which used lives th’ executor to be.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>                    5</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>Those hours that with gentle work did frame</a>
<a id='line_77'>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell</a>
<a id='line_78'>Will play the tyrants to the very same,</a>
<a id='line_79'>And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</a>
<a id='line_80'>For never-resting time leads summer on</a>
<a id='line_81'>To hideous winter and confounds him there,</a>
<a id='line_82'>Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</a>
<a id='line_83'>Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:</a>
<a id='line_84'>Then were not summer’s distillation left</a>
<a id='line_85'>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</a>
<a id='line_86'>Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,</a>
<a id='line_87'>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</a>
<a id='line_88'>  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,</a>
<a id='line_89'>  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>                    6</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,</a>
<a id='line_95'>In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:</a>
<a id='line_96'>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,</a>
<a id='line_97'>With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:</a>
<a id='line_98'>That use is not forbidden usury,</a>
<a id='line_99'>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</a>
<a id='line_100'>That’s for thy self to breed another thee,</a>
<a id='line_101'>Or ten times happier be it ten for one,</a>
<a id='line_102'>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,</a>
<a id='line_103'>If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:</a>
<a id='line_104'>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</a>
<a id='line_105'>Leaving thee living in posterity?</a>
<a id='line_106'>  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,</a>
<a id='line_107'>  To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.</a>

<a id='line_112'>Lo in the orient when the gracious light</a>
<a id='line_113'>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</a>
<a id='line_114'>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</a>
<a id='line_115'>Serving with looks his sacred majesty,</a>
<a id='line_116'>And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,</a>
<a id='line_117'>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</a>
<a id='line_118'>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</a>
<a id='line_119'>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</a>
<a id='line_120'>But when from highmost pitch with weary car,</a>
<a id='line_121'>Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,</a>
<a id='line_122'>The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are</a>
<a id='line_123'>From his low tract and look another way:</a>
<a id='line_124'>  So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:</a>
<a id='line_125'>  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.</a>

<a id='line_130'>Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?</a>
<a id='line_131'>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:</a>
<a id='line_132'>Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,</a>
<a id='line_133'>Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?</a>
<a id='line_134'>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</a>
<a id='line_135'>By unions married do offend thine ear,</a>
<a id='line_136'>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</a>
<a id='line_137'>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:</a>
<a id='line_138'>Mark how one string sweet husband to another,</a>
<a id='line_139'>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</a>
<a id='line_140'>Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,</a>
<a id='line_141'>Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</a>
<a id='line_142'>  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,</a>
<a id='line_143'>  Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.</a>

<a id='line_146'>                    9</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,</a>
<a id='line_149'>That thou consum’st thy self in single life?</a>
<a id='line_150'>Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,</a>
<a id='line_151'>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,</a>
<a id='line_152'>The world will be thy widow and still weep,</a>
<a id='line_153'>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</a>
<a id='line_154'>When every private widow well may keep,</a>
<a id='line_155'>By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:</a>
<a id='line_156'>Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend</a>
<a id='line_157'>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;</a>
<a id='line_158'>But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,</a>
<a id='line_159'>And kept unused the user so destroys it:</a>
<a id='line_160'>  No love toward others in that bosom sits</a>
<a id='line_161'>  That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>

<a id='line_164'>                    10</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any</a>
<a id='line_167'>Who for thy self art so unprovident.</a>
<a id='line_168'>Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,</a>
<a id='line_169'>But that thou none lov’st is most evident:</a>
<a id='line_170'>For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,</a>
<a id='line_171'>That ’gainst thy self thou stick’st not to conspire,</a>
<a id='line_172'>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</a>
<a id='line_173'>Which to repair should be thy chief desire:</a>
<a id='line_174'>O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,</a>
<a id='line_175'>Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?</a>
<a id='line_176'>Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,</a>
<a id='line_177'>Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,</a>
<a id='line_178'>  Make thee another self for love of me,</a>
<a id='line_179'>  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</a>

<a id='line_184'>As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,</a>
<a id='line_185'>In one of thine, from that which thou departest,</a>
<a id='line_186'>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,</a>
<a id='line_187'>Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,</a>
<a id='line_188'>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,</a>
<a id='line_189'>Without this folly, age, and cold decay,</a>
<a id='line_190'>If all were minded so, the times should cease,</a>
<a id='line_191'>And threescore year would make the world away:</a>
<a id='line_192'>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</a>
<a id='line_193'>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</a>
<a id='line_194'>Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;</a>
<a id='line_195'>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:</a>
<a id='line_196'>  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>                    12</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>When I do count the clock that tells the time,</a>
<a id='line_203'>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,</a>
<a id='line_204'>When I behold the violet past prime,</a>
<a id='line_205'>And sable curls all silvered o’er with white:</a>
<a id='line_206'>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</a>
<a id='line_207'>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd</a>
<a id='line_208'>And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves</a>
<a id='line_209'>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:</a>
<a id='line_210'>Then of thy beauty do I question make</a>
<a id='line_211'>That thou among the wastes of time must go,</a>
<a id='line_212'>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,</a>
<a id='line_213'>And die as fast as they see others grow,</a>
<a id='line_214'>  And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence</a>
<a id='line_215'>  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.</a>

<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>                    13</a>

<a id='line_220'>O that you were your self, but love you are</a>
<a id='line_221'>No longer yours, than you your self here live,</a>
<a id='line_222'>Against this coming end you should prepare,</a>
<a id='line_223'>And your sweet semblance to some other give.</a>
<a id='line_224'>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</a>
<a id='line_225'>Find no determination, then you were</a>
<a id='line_226'>Your self again after your self’s decease,</a>
<a id='line_227'>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</a>
<a id='line_228'>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</a>
<a id='line_229'>Which husbandry in honour might uphold,</a>
<a id='line_230'>Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day</a>
<a id='line_231'>And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?</a>
<a id='line_232'>  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,</a>
<a id='line_233'>  You had a father, let your son say so.</a>

<a id='line_238'>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,</a>
<a id='line_239'>And yet methinks I have astronomy,</a>
<a id='line_240'>But not to tell of good, or evil luck,</a>
<a id='line_241'>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,</a>
<a id='line_242'>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;</a>
<a id='line_243'>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,</a>
<a id='line_244'>Or say with princes if it shall go well</a>
<a id='line_245'>By oft predict that I in heaven find.</a>
<a id='line_246'>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</a>
<a id='line_247'>And constant stars in them I read such art</a>
<a id='line_248'>As truth and beauty shall together thrive</a>
<a id='line_249'>If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:</a>
<a id='line_250'>  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,</a>
<a id='line_251'>  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.</a>

<a id='line_254'>                    15</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>When I consider every thing that grows</a>
<a id='line_257'>Holds in perfection but a little moment.</a>
<a id='line_258'>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</a>
<a id='line_259'>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.</a>
<a id='line_260'>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</a>
<a id='line_261'>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:</a>
<a id='line_262'>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</a>
<a id='line_263'>And wear their brave state out of memory.</a>
<a id='line_264'>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,</a>
<a id='line_265'>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</a>
<a id='line_266'>Where wasteful time debateth with decay</a>
<a id='line_267'>To change your day of youth to sullied night,</a>
<a id='line_268'>  And all in war with Time for love of you,</a>
<a id='line_269'>  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</a>

<a id='line_272'>                    16</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>But wherefore do not you a mightier way</a>
<a id='line_275'>Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?</a>
<a id='line_276'>And fortify your self in your decay</a>
<a id='line_277'>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</a>
<a id='line_278'>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</a>
<a id='line_279'>And many maiden gardens yet unset,</a>
<a id='line_280'>With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,</a>
<a id='line_281'>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</a>
<a id='line_282'>So should the lines of life that life repair</a>
<a id='line_283'>Which this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen</a>
<a id='line_284'>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair</a>
<a id='line_285'>Can make you live your self in eyes of men.</a>
<a id='line_286'>  To give away your self, keeps your self still,</a>
<a id='line_287'>  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>

<a id='line_292'>Who will believe my verse in time to come</a>
<a id='line_293'>If it were filled with your most high deserts?</a>
<a id='line_294'>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</a>
<a id='line_295'>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:</a>
<a id='line_296'>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</a>
<a id='line_297'>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</a>
<a id='line_298'>The age to come would say this poet lies,</a>
<a id='line_299'>Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.</a>
<a id='line_300'>So should my papers (yellowed with their age)</a>
<a id='line_301'>Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,</a>
<a id='line_302'>And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage,</a>
<a id='line_303'>And stretched metre of an antique song.</a>
<a id='line_304'>  But were some child of yours alive that time,</a>
<a id='line_305'>  You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.</a>

<a id='line_310'>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</a>
<a id='line_311'>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</a>
<a id='line_312'>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</a>
<a id='line_313'>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:</a>
<a id='line_314'>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</a>
<a id='line_315'>And often is his gold complexion dimmed,</a>
<a id='line_316'>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</a>
<a id='line_317'>By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:</a>
<a id='line_318'>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</a>
<a id='line_319'>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,</a>
<a id='line_320'>Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,</a>
<a id='line_321'>When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,</a>
<a id='line_322'>  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</a>
<a id='line_323'>  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</a>

<a id='line_328'>Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,</a>
<a id='line_329'>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,</a>
<a id='line_330'>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,</a>
<a id='line_331'>And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,</a>
<a id='line_332'>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,</a>

<a id='line_337'>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,</a>
<a id='line_338'>Him in thy course untainted do allow,</a>
<a id='line_339'>For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.</a>
<a id='line_340'>  Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,</a>

<a id='line_1394'>Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,</a>

<a id='line_1826'>The owner’s tongue doth publish every where.</a>
<a id='line_1827'>Our love was new, and then but in the spring,</a>
<a id='line_1828'>When I was wont to greet it with my lays,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,</a>

<a id='line_1863'>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,</a>
<a id='line_1864'>In process of the seasons have I seen,</a>
<a id='line_1865'>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.</a>
<a id='line_1867'>Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,</a>
<a id='line_1868'>Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand</a>
<a id='line_1870'>Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.</a>

<a id='line_1877'>Let not my love be called idolatry,</a>
<a id='line_1878'>Nor my beloved as an idol show,</a>

<a id='line_1881'>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>Still constant in a wondrous excellence,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>Therefore my verse to constancy confined,</a>
<a id='line_1884'>One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</a>
<a id='line_1885'>Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,</a>
<a id='line_1887'>And in this change is my invention spent,</a>
<a id='line_1888'>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</a>
<a id='line_1889'>  Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.</a>

<a id='line_1900'>Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>I see their antique pen would have expressed,</a>
<a id='line_1902'>Even such a beauty as you master now.</a>
<a id='line_1903'>So all their praises are but prophecies</a>
<a id='line_1904'>Of this our time, all you prefiguring,</a>
<a id='line_1905'>And for they looked but with divining eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>They had not skill enough your worth to sing:</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  For we which now behold these present days,</a>

<a id='line_1915'>Can yet the lease of my true love control,</a>
<a id='line_1916'>Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.</a>
<a id='line_1917'>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,</a>
<a id='line_1918'>And the sad augurs mock their own presage,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>Incertainties now crown themselves assured,</a>
<a id='line_1920'>And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</a>
<a id='line_1921'>Now with the drops of this most balmy time,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,</a>
<a id='line_1923'>Since spite of him I’ll live in this poor rhyme,</a>
<a id='line_1924'>While he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes.</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</a>

<a id='line_1934'>That may express my love, or thy dear merit?</a>
<a id='line_1935'>Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,</a>

<a id='line_1937'>Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.</a>
<a id='line_1939'>So that eternal love in love’s fresh case,</a>
<a id='line_1940'>Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</a>
<a id='line_1942'>But makes antiquity for aye his page,</a>

<a id='line_2709'>My soul doth tell my body that he may,</a>
<a id='line_2710'>Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,</a>
<a id='line_2711'>But rising at thy name doth point out thee,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,</a>
<a id='line_2713'>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,</a>
<a id='line_2714'>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.</a>
<a id='line_2715'>  No want of conscience hold it that I call,</a>
<a id='line_2716'>  Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.</a>

<a id='line_2721'>In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn,</a>
<a id='line_2722'>But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,</a>
<a id='line_2723'>In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,</a>
<a id='line_2724'>In vowing new hate after new love bearing:</a>
<a id='line_2725'>But why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee,</a>
<a id='line_2726'>When I break twenty? I am perjured most,</a>
<a id='line_2727'>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:</a>
<a id='line_2728'>And all my honest faith in thee is lost.</a>
<a id='line_2729'>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:</a>
<a id='line_2730'>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,</a>
<a id='line_2731'>And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,</a>
<a id='line_2732'>Or made them swear against the thing they see.</a>
<a id='line_2733'>  For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,</a>
<a id='line_2734'>  To swear against the truth so foul a be.</a>

<a id='line_2739'>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,</a>
<a id='line_2740'>A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,</a>
<a id='line_2741'>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</a>
<a id='line_2742'>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:</a>
<a id='line_2743'>Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,</a>
<a id='line_2744'>A dateless lively heat still to endure,</a>
<a id='line_2745'>And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,</a>
<a id='line_2746'>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:</a>
<a id='line_2747'>But at my mistress’ eye Love’s brand new-fired,</a>
<a id='line_2748'>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,</a>
<a id='line_2749'>I sick withal the help of bath desired,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>And thither hied a sad distempered guest.</a>
<a id='line_2751'>  But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,</a>
<a id='line_2752'>  Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress’ eyes.</a>

<a id='line_2757'>The little Love-god lying once asleep,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</a>
<a id='line_2759'>Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,</a>
<a id='line_2760'>Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,</a>
<a id='line_2761'>The fairest votary took up that fire,</a>
<a id='line_2762'>Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,</a>
<a id='line_2763'>And so the general of hot desire,</a>
<a id='line_2764'>Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.</a>
<a id='line_2765'>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</a>
<a id='line_2766'>Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,</a>
<a id='line_2768'>For men discased, but I my mistress’ thrall,</a>
<a id='line_2769'>  Came there for cure and this by that I prove,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>  Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.</a>
