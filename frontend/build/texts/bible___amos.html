<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he</a>
<a id='line_4'>saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the</a>
<a id='line_5'>days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the</a>
<a id='line_6'>earthquake.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:2 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice</a>
<a id='line_9'>from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and</a>
<a id='line_10'>the top of Carmel shall wither.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:3 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for</a>
<a id='line_13'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have</a>
<a id='line_14'>threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron: 1:4 But I will</a>
<a id='line_15'>send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces</a>
<a id='line_16'>of Benhadad.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:5 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant</a>
<a id='line_19'>from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the</a>
<a id='line_20'>house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto</a>
<a id='line_21'>Kir, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:6 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for</a>
<a id='line_24'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they</a>
<a id='line_25'>carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:</a>
<a id='line_26'>1:7 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the</a>
<a id='line_27'>palaces thereof: 1:8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod,</a>
<a id='line_28'>and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine</a>
<a id='line_29'>hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish,</a>
<a id='line_30'>saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:9 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for</a>
<a id='line_33'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they</a>
<a id='line_34'>delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the</a>
<a id='line_35'>brotherly covenant: 1:10 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus,</a>
<a id='line_36'>which shall devour the palaces thereof.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:11 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for</a>
<a id='line_39'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did</a>
<a id='line_40'>pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his</a>
<a id='line_41'>anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: 1:12 But I</a>
<a id='line_42'>will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:13 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of</a>
<a id='line_45'>Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof;</a>
<a id='line_46'>because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they</a>
<a id='line_47'>might enlarge their border: 1:14 But I will kindle a fire in the wall</a>
<a id='line_48'>of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in</a>
<a id='line_49'>the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: 1:15</a>
<a id='line_50'>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together,</a>
<a id='line_51'>saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>2:1 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for</a>
<a id='line_54'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned</a>
<a id='line_55'>the bones of the king of Edom into lime: 2:2 But I will send a fire</a>
<a id='line_56'>upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall</a>
<a id='line_57'>die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: 2:3</a>
<a id='line_58'>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all</a>
<a id='line_59'>the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>2:4 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for</a>
<a id='line_62'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have</a>
<a id='line_63'>despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and</a>
<a id='line_64'>their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have</a>
<a id='line_65'>walked: 2:5 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the</a>
<a id='line_66'>palaces of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>2:6 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for</a>
<a id='line_69'>four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold</a>
<a id='line_70'>the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; 2:7 That</a>
<a id='line_71'>pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn</a>
<a id='line_72'>aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto</a>
<a id='line_73'>the same maid, to profane my holy name: 2:8 And they lay themselves</a>
<a id='line_74'>down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the</a>
<a id='line_75'>wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:9 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the</a>
<a id='line_78'>height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed</a>
<a id='line_79'>his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty</a>
<a id='line_82'>years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:11 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men</a>
<a id='line_85'>for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the</a>
<a id='line_86'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the</a>
<a id='line_89'>prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:13 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full</a>
<a id='line_92'>of sheaves.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:14 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong</a>
<a id='line_95'>shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver</a>
<a id='line_96'>himself: 2:15 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he</a>
<a id='line_97'>that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that</a>
<a id='line_98'>rideth the horse deliver himself.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>2:16 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked</a>
<a id='line_101'>in that day, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>3:1 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children</a>
<a id='line_104'>of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land</a>
<a id='line_105'>of Egypt, saying, 3:2 You only have I known of all the families of the</a>
<a id='line_106'>earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>3:3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?  3:4 Will a lion</a>
<a id='line_109'>roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of</a>
<a id='line_110'>his den, if he have taken nothing?  3:5 Can a bird fall in a snare</a>
<a id='line_111'>upon the earth, where no gin is for him?  shall one take up a snare</a>
<a id='line_112'>from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?  3:6 Shall a trumpet be</a>
<a id='line_113'>blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?  shall there be evil</a>
<a id='line_114'>in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?  3:7 Surely the Lord GOD</a>
<a id='line_115'>will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the</a>
<a id='line_116'>prophets.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>3:8 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken,</a>
<a id='line_119'>who can but prophesy?  3:9 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in</a>
<a id='line_120'>the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon</a>
<a id='line_121'>the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst</a>
<a id='line_122'>thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>3:10 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up</a>
<a id='line_125'>violence and robbery in their palaces.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>3:11 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be</a>
<a id='line_128'>even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from</a>
<a id='line_129'>thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>3:12 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_132'>the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of</a>
<a id='line_133'>Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and</a>
<a id='line_134'>in Damascus in a couch.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>3:13 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD,</a>
<a id='line_137'>the God of hosts, 3:14 That in the day that I shall visit the</a>
<a id='line_138'>transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of</a>
<a id='line_139'>Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the</a>
<a id='line_140'>ground.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>3:15 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the</a>
<a id='line_143'>houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end,</a>
<a id='line_144'>saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>4:1 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_147'>Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to</a>
<a id='line_148'>their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>4:2 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall</a>
<a id='line_151'>come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your</a>
<a id='line_152'>posterity with fishhooks.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>4:3 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is</a>
<a id='line_155'>before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>4:4 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression;</a>
<a id='line_158'>and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three</a>
<a id='line_159'>years: 4:5 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and</a>
<a id='line_160'>proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye</a>
<a id='line_161'>children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>4:6 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,</a>
<a id='line_164'>and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto</a>
<a id='line_165'>me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>4:7 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet</a>
<a id='line_168'>three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city,</a>
<a id='line_169'>and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained</a>
<a id='line_170'>upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>4:8 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but</a>
<a id='line_173'>they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the</a>
<a id='line_174'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>4:9 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and</a>
<a id='line_177'>your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the</a>
<a id='line_178'>palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the</a>
<a id='line_179'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>4:10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt:</a>
<a id='line_182'>your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your</a>
<a id='line_183'>horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your</a>
<a id='line_184'>nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>4:11 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and</a>
<a id='line_187'>Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet</a>
<a id='line_188'>have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>4:12 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will</a>
<a id='line_191'>do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>4:13 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,</a>
<a id='line_194'>and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning</a>
<a id='line_195'>darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD,</a>
<a id='line_196'>The God of hosts, is his name.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>5:1 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation,</a>
<a id='line_199'>O house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>5:2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is</a>
<a id='line_202'>forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>5:3 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand</a>
<a id='line_205'>shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall</a>
<a id='line_206'>leave ten, to the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>5:4 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and</a>
<a id='line_209'>ye shall live: 5:5 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and</a>
<a id='line_210'>pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and</a>
<a id='line_211'>Bethel shall come to nought.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>5:6 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in</a>
<a id='line_214'>the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in</a>
<a id='line_215'>Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>5:7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in</a>
<a id='line_218'>the earth, 5:8 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and</a>
<a id='line_219'>turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark</a>
<a id='line_220'>with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them</a>
<a id='line_221'>out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: 5:9 That</a>
<a id='line_222'>strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled</a>
<a id='line_223'>shall come against the fortress.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>5:10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that</a>
<a id='line_226'>speaketh uprightly.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>5:11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye</a>
<a id='line_229'>take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone,</a>
<a id='line_230'>but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards,</a>
<a id='line_231'>but ye shall not drink wine of them.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>5:12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:</a>
<a id='line_234'>they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor</a>
<a id='line_235'>in the gate from their right.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>5:13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is</a>
<a id='line_238'>an evil time.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>5:14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the</a>
<a id='line_241'>God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>5:15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the</a>
<a id='line_244'>gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the</a>
<a id='line_245'>remnant of Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>5:16 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus;</a>
<a id='line_248'>Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the</a>
<a id='line_249'>highways, Alas! alas!  and they shall call the husbandman to mourning,</a>
<a id='line_250'>and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>5:17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through</a>
<a id='line_253'>thee, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>5:18 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it</a>
<a id='line_256'>for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>5:19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went</a>
<a id='line_259'>into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit</a>
<a id='line_260'>him.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>5:20 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even</a>
<a id='line_263'>very dark, and no brightness in it?  5:21 I hate, I despise your feast</a>
<a id='line_264'>days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>5:22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I</a>
<a id='line_267'>will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of</a>
<a id='line_268'>your fat beasts.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>5:23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not</a>
<a id='line_271'>hear the melody of thy viols.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>5:24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a</a>
<a id='line_274'>mighty stream.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>5:25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the</a>
<a id='line_277'>wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?  5:26 But ye have borne the</a>
<a id='line_278'>tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god,</a>
<a id='line_279'>which ye made to yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>5:27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,</a>
<a id='line_282'>saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>6:1 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_285'>Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of</a>
<a id='line_286'>Israel came!  6:2 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye</a>
<a id='line_287'>to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they</a>
<a id='line_288'>better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</a>
<a id='line_289'>6:3 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence</a>
<a id='line_290'>to come near; 6:4 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves</a>
<a id='line_291'>upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves</a>
<a id='line_292'>out of the midst of the stall; 6:5 That chant to the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_293'>viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; 6:6</a>
<a id='line_294'>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief</a>
<a id='line_295'>ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>6:7 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go</a>
<a id='line_298'>captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be</a>
<a id='line_299'>removed.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>6:8 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of</a>
<a id='line_302'>hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:</a>
<a id='line_303'>therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>6:9 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house,</a>
<a id='line_306'>that they shall die.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>6:10 And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to</a>
<a id='line_309'>bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is</a>
<a id='line_310'>by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall</a>
<a id='line_311'>say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make</a>
<a id='line_312'>mention of the name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>6:11 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great</a>
<a id='line_315'>house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>6:12 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?</a>
<a id='line_318'>for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness</a>
<a id='line_319'>into hemlock: 6:13 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say,</a>
<a id='line_320'>Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?  6:14 But, behold,</a>
<a id='line_321'>I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the</a>
<a id='line_322'>LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in</a>
<a id='line_323'>of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>7:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed</a>
<a id='line_326'>grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;</a>
<a id='line_327'>and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>7:2 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the</a>
<a id='line_330'>grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee:</a>
<a id='line_331'>by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>7:3 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>7:4 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD</a>
<a id='line_336'>called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat</a>
<a id='line_337'>up a part.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>7:5 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall</a>
<a id='line_340'>Jacob arise? for he is small.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>7:6 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord</a>
<a id='line_343'>GOD.</a>
<a id='line_344'></a>
<a id='line_345'>7:7 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by</a>
<a id='line_346'>a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>7:8 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A</a>
<a id='line_349'>plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the</a>
<a id='line_350'>midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more: 7:9</a>
<a id='line_351'>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of</a>
<a id='line_352'>Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of</a>
<a id='line_353'>Jeroboam with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>7:10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of</a>
<a id='line_356'>Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_357'>house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>7:11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel</a>
<a id='line_360'>shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>7:12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into</a>
<a id='line_363'>the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 7:13 But</a>
<a id='line_364'>prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king’s chapel,</a>
<a id='line_365'>and it is the king’s court.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>7:14 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,</a>
<a id='line_368'>neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of</a>
<a id='line_369'>sycomore fruit: 7:15 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and</a>
<a id='line_370'>the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>7:16 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,</a>
<a id='line_373'>Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house</a>
<a id='line_374'>of Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>7:17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the</a>
<a id='line_377'>city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy</a>
<a id='line_378'>land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land:</a>
<a id='line_379'>and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>8:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of</a>
<a id='line_382'>summer fruit.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>8:2 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer</a>
<a id='line_385'>fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of</a>
<a id='line_386'>Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</a>
<a id='line_387'></a>
<a id='line_388'>8:3 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith</a>
<a id='line_389'>the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they</a>
<a id='line_390'>shall cast them forth with silence.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>8:4 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor</a>
<a id='line_393'>of the land to fail, 8:5 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that</a>
<a id='line_394'>we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making</a>
<a id='line_395'>the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by</a>
<a id='line_396'>deceit?  8:6 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a</a>
<a id='line_397'>pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?  8:7 The LORD</a>
<a id='line_398'>hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any</a>
<a id='line_399'>of their works.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>8:8 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that</a>
<a id='line_402'>dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall</a>
<a id='line_403'>be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>8:9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I</a>
<a id='line_406'>will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in</a>
<a id='line_407'>the clear day: 8:10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all</a>
<a id='line_408'>your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all</a>
<a id='line_409'>loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the</a>
<a id='line_410'>mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>8:11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a</a>
<a id='line_413'>famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but</a>
<a id='line_414'>of hearing the words of the LORD: 8:12 And they shall wander from sea</a>
<a id='line_415'>to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro</a>
<a id='line_416'>to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>8:13 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for</a>
<a id='line_419'>thirst.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>8:14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan,</a>
<a id='line_422'>liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and</a>
<a id='line_423'>never rise up again.</a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
<a id='line_425'>9:1 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the</a>
<a id='line_426'>lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the</a>
<a id='line_427'>head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he</a>
<a id='line_428'>that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them</a>
<a id='line_429'>shall not be delivered.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>9:2 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;</a>
<a id='line_432'>though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: 9:3 And</a>
<a id='line_433'>though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and</a>
<a id='line_434'>take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the</a>
<a id='line_435'>bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall</a>
<a id='line_436'>bite them: 9:4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies,</a>
<a id='line_437'>thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will</a>
<a id='line_438'>set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>9:5 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it</a>
<a id='line_441'>shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise</a>
<a id='line_442'>up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of</a>
<a id='line_443'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_444'></a>
<a id='line_445'>9:6 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded</a>
<a id='line_446'>his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_447'>poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.</a>
<a id='line_448'></a>
<a id='line_449'>9:7 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of</a>
<a id='line_450'>Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land</a>
<a id='line_451'>of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</a>
<a id='line_452'>9:8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and</a>
<a id='line_453'>I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will</a>
<a id='line_454'>not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>9:9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among</a>
<a id='line_457'>all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the</a>
<a id='line_458'>least grain fall upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>9:10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say,</a>
<a id='line_461'>The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>9:11 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is</a>
<a id='line_464'>fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his</a>
<a id='line_465'>ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 9:12 That they may</a>
<a id='line_466'>possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called</a>
<a id='line_467'>by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>9:13 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall</a>
<a id='line_470'>overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed;</a>
<a id='line_471'>and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>9:14 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_474'>they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall</a>
<a id='line_475'>plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make</a>
<a id='line_476'>gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>9:15 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be</a>
<a id='line_479'>pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD</a>
<a id='line_480'>thy God.</a>
