<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out</a>
<a id='line_6'>unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!  1:3 Why dost thou shew</a>
<a id='line_7'>me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and</a>
<a id='line_8'>violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and</a>
<a id='line_9'>contention.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth:</a>
<a id='line_12'>for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong</a>
<a id='line_13'>judgment proceedeth.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:5 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously:</a>
<a id='line_16'>for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though</a>
<a id='line_17'>it be told you.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation,</a>
<a id='line_20'>which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the</a>
<a id='line_21'>dwellingplaces that are not theirs.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:7 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity</a>
<a id='line_24'>shall proceed of themselves.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more</a>
<a id='line_27'>fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread</a>
<a id='line_28'>themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as</a>
<a id='line_29'>the eagle that hasteth to eat.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the</a>
<a id='line_32'>east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a</a>
<a id='line_35'>scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall</a>
<a id='line_36'>heap dust, and take it.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:11 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,</a>
<a id='line_39'>imputing this his power unto his god.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:12 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we</a>
<a id='line_42'>shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O</a>
<a id='line_43'>mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:13 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on</a>
<a id='line_46'>iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,</a>
<a id='line_47'>and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more</a>
<a id='line_48'>righteous than he?  1:14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as</a>
<a id='line_49'>the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?  1:15 They take up</a>
<a id='line_50'>all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather</a>
<a id='line_51'>them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto</a>
<a id='line_54'>their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat</a>
<a id='line_55'>plenteous.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>1:17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually</a>
<a id='line_58'>to slay the nations?  2:1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon</a>
<a id='line_59'>the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I</a>
<a id='line_60'>shall answer when I am reproved.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>2:2 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it</a>
<a id='line_63'>plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>2:3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it</a>
<a id='line_66'>shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it</a>
<a id='line_67'>will surely come, it will not tarry.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the</a>
<a id='line_70'>just shall live by his faith.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:5 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,</a>
<a id='line_73'>neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as</a>
<a id='line_74'>death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations,</a>
<a id='line_75'>and heapeth unto him all people: 2:6 Shall not all these take up a</a>
<a id='line_76'>parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe</a>
<a id='line_77'>to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him</a>
<a id='line_78'>that ladeth himself with thick clay!  2:7 Shall they not rise up</a>
<a id='line_79'>suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou</a>
<a id='line_80'>shalt be for booties unto them?  2:8 Because thou hast spoiled many</a>
<a id='line_81'>nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of</a>
<a id='line_82'>men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all</a>
<a id='line_83'>that dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:9 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that</a>
<a id='line_86'>he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power</a>
<a id='line_87'>of evil!  2:10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off</a>
<a id='line_88'>many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the</a>
<a id='line_91'>timber shall answer it.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>2:12 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a</a>
<a id='line_94'>city by iniquity!  2:13 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that</a>
<a id='line_95'>the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary</a>
<a id='line_96'>themselves for very vanity?  2:14 For the earth shall be filled with</a>
<a id='line_97'>the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy</a>
<a id='line_100'>bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on</a>
<a id='line_101'>their nakedness!  2:16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink</a>
<a id='line_102'>thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_103'>right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on</a>
<a id='line_104'>thy glory.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of</a>
<a id='line_107'>beasts, which made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the</a>
<a id='line_108'>violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath</a>
<a id='line_111'>graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of</a>
<a id='line_112'>his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?  2:19 Woe unto him that</a>
<a id='line_113'>saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach!</a>
<a id='line_114'>Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath</a>
<a id='line_115'>at all in the midst of it.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>2:20 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep</a>
<a id='line_118'>silence before him.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>3:1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>3:2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive</a>
<a id='line_123'>thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make</a>
<a id='line_124'>known; in wrath remember mercy.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>3:3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His</a>
<a id='line_127'>glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>3:4 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of</a>
<a id='line_130'>his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>3:5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at</a>
<a id='line_133'>his feet.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the</a>
<a id='line_136'>nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual</a>
<a id='line_137'>hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the</a>
<a id='line_140'>land of Midian did tremble.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>3:8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger</a>
<a id='line_143'>against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst</a>
<a id='line_144'>ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?  3:9 Thy bow was</a>
<a id='line_145'>made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word.</a>
<a id='line_146'>Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>3:10 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the</a>
<a id='line_149'>water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands</a>
<a id='line_150'>on high.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of</a>
<a id='line_153'>thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>3:12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst</a>
<a id='line_156'>thresh the heathen in anger.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>3:13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for</a>
<a id='line_159'>salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the</a>
<a id='line_160'>house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck.</a>
<a id='line_161'>Selah.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his</a>
<a id='line_164'>villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing</a>
<a id='line_165'>was as to devour the poor secretly.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>3:15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the</a>
<a id='line_168'>heap of great waters.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:</a>
<a id='line_171'>rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I</a>
<a id='line_172'>might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people,</a>
<a id='line_173'>he will invade them with his troops.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be</a>
<a id='line_176'>in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall</a>
<a id='line_177'>yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there</a>
<a id='line_178'>shall be no herd in the stalls: 3:18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I</a>
<a id='line_179'>will joy in the God of my salvation.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:19 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’</a>
<a id='line_182'>feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief</a>
<a id='line_183'>singer on my stringed instruments.</a>
