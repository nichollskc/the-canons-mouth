<a id='line_78'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_79'>      I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night</a>

<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>      MESSENGER.</a>

<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_93'>      But few of any sort, and none of name.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_97'>      A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full</a>
<a id='line_98'>      numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on</a>
<a id='line_99'>      a young Florentine called Claudio.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_103'>      Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro.</a>
<a id='line_104'>      He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</a>
<a id='line_106'>      bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_110'>      He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_114'>      I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy</a>
<a id='line_115'>      in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough</a>
<a id='line_116'>      without a badge of bitterness.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Did he break out into tears?</a>

<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_128'>      A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those</a>

<a id='line_130'>      joy at weeping!</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>      BEATRICE.</a>

<a id='line_142'>      LEONATO.</a>

<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>      HERO.</a>
<a id='line_147'>      My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_151'>      O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_155'>      He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the</a>
<a id='line_156'>      flight; and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed</a>
<a id='line_157'>      for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how</a>
<a id='line_158'>      many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he</a>
<a id='line_159'>      killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_163'>      Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he’ll be</a>
<a id='line_164'>      meet with you, I doubt it not.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_168'>      He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_172'>      You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very</a>
<a id='line_173'>      valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_177'>      And a good soldier too, lady.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_181'>      And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_185'>      A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable</a>
<a id='line_186'>      virtues.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_190'>      It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the</a>
<a id='line_191'>      stuffing,—well, we are all mortal.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_195'>      You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war</a>
<a id='line_196'>      betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a</a>
<a id='line_197'>      skirmish of wit between them.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_201'>      Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his</a>
<a id='line_202'>      five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed</a>
<a id='line_203'>      with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let</a>
<a id='line_204'>      him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for</a>
<a id='line_205'>      it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable</a>
<a id='line_206'>      creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new</a>
<a id='line_207'>      sworn brother.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_211'>      Is’t possible?</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_215'>      Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of</a>
<a id='line_216'>      his hat; it ever changes with the next block.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_220'>      I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_224'>      No; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is</a>
<a id='line_225'>      his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a</a>
<a id='line_226'>      voyage with him to the devil?</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_230'>      He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_234'>      O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught</a>
<a id='line_235'>      than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help</a>
<a id='line_236'>      the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost</a>
<a id='line_237'>      him a thousand pound ere he be cured.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>      MESSENGER.</a>
<a id='line_241'>      I will hold friends with you, lady.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_245'>      Do, good friend.</a>

<a id='line_253'>      No, not till a hot January.</a>

<a id='line_264'>      DON PEDRO.</a>
<a id='line_265'>      Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the</a>

<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_270'>      Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for</a>
<a id='line_271'>      trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart</a>
<a id='line_272'>      from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</a>

<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>      DON PEDRO.</a>
<a id='line_276'>      You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your</a>

<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_281'>      Her mother hath many times told me so.</a>

<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_285'>      Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>      LEONATO.</a>
<a id='line_289'>      Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>      DON PEDRO.</a>
<a id='line_293'>      You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are,</a>
<a id='line_294'>      being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for</a>
<a id='line_295'>      you are like an honourable father.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_299'>      If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on</a>
<a id='line_300'>      her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_304'>      I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody</a>

<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>      BENEDICK.</a>

<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_313'>      Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food</a>
<a id='line_314'>      to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to</a>
<a id='line_315'>      disdain if you come in her presence.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_319'>      Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all</a>
<a id='line_320'>      ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart</a>
<a id='line_321'>      that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.</a>

<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_325'>      A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled</a>
<a id='line_326'>      with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of</a>
<a id='line_327'>      your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow</a>
<a id='line_328'>      than a man swear he loves me.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_332'>      God keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or</a>
<a id='line_333'>      other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.</a>

<a id='line_358'>      DON PEDRO.</a>
<a id='line_359'>      That is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior</a>
<a id='line_360'>      Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him</a>
<a id='line_361'>      we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays</a>

<a id='line_1020'>      Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a</a>

<a id='line_5541'></a>
<a id='line_5542'>      HERO.</a>
<a id='line_5543'>      And when I liv’d, I was your other wife:</a>
<a id='line_5544'>      [_Unmasking._] And when you lov’d, you were my other husband.</a>

<a id='line_5551'>      HERO.</a>
<a id='line_5552'>      Nothing certainer:</a>
<a id='line_5553'>      One Hero died defil’d, but I do live,</a>
<a id='line_5554'>      And surely as I live, I am a maid.</a>

<a id='line_5567'>      When after that the holy rites are ended,</a>
<a id='line_5568'>      I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death:</a>
<a id='line_5569'>      Meantime, let wonder seem familiar,</a>
<a id='line_5570'>      And to the chapel let us presently.</a>

<a id='line_5573'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5574'>      Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?</a>

<a id='line_5576'></a>
<a id='line_5577'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_5578'>      [_Unmasking._] I answer to that name. What is your will?</a>

<a id='line_5580'></a>
<a id='line_5581'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5582'>      Do not you love me?</a>

<a id='line_5584'></a>
<a id='line_5585'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_5586'>      Why, no; no more than reason.</a>

<a id='line_5588'></a>
<a id='line_5589'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5590'>      Why, then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio</a>
<a id='line_5591'>      Have been deceived; for they swore you did.</a>
<a id='line_5592'></a>
<a id='line_5593'></a>

<a id='line_5603'>      Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula,</a>
<a id='line_5604'>      Are much deceiv’d; for they did swear you did.</a>
<a id='line_5605'></a>
<a id='line_5606'></a>
<a id='line_5607'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5608'>      They swore that you were almost sick for me.</a>

<a id='line_5610'></a>
<a id='line_5611'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_5612'>      They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.</a>

<a id='line_5614'></a>
<a id='line_5615'>      BENEDICK.</a>

<a id='line_5618'></a>
<a id='line_5619'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_5620'>      No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</a>

<a id='line_5628'>      And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her;</a>
<a id='line_5629'>      For here’s a paper written in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_5630'>      A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</a>
<a id='line_5631'>      Fashion’d to Beatrice.</a>
<a id='line_5632'></a>
<a id='line_5633'></a>
<a id='line_5634'>      HERO.</a>
<a id='line_5635'>      And here’s another,</a>
<a id='line_5636'>      Writ in my cousin’s hand, stolen from her pocket,</a>
<a id='line_5637'>      Containing her affection unto Benedick.</a>
<a id='line_5638'></a>
<a id='line_5639'></a>
<a id='line_5640'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5641'>      A miracle! here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will</a>
<a id='line_5642'>      have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity.</a>
<a id='line_5643'></a>
<a id='line_5644'></a>
<a id='line_5645'>      BEATRICE.</a>
<a id='line_5646'>      I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great</a>
<a id='line_5647'>      persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were</a>
<a id='line_5648'>      in a consumption.</a>
<a id='line_5649'></a>
<a id='line_5650'></a>
<a id='line_5651'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5652'>      Peace! I will stop your mouth. [_Kisses her._]</a>

<a id='line_5656'>      How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?</a>
<a id='line_5657'></a>
<a id='line_5658'></a>
<a id='line_5659'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5660'>      I’ll tell thee what, Prince; a college of witcrackers cannout</a>
<a id='line_5661'>      flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or</a>
<a id='line_5662'>      an epigram? No; if man will be beaten with brains, a’ shall wear</a>
<a id='line_5663'>      nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to</a>
<a id='line_5664'>      marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say</a>
<a id='line_5665'>      against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said</a>
<a id='line_5666'>      against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion.</a>
<a id='line_5667'>      For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in</a>
<a id='line_5668'>      that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my</a>
<a id='line_5669'>      cousin.</a>

<a id='line_5672'>      CLAUDIO.</a>
<a id='line_5673'>      I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might</a>
<a id='line_5674'>      have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a</a>
<a id='line_5675'>      double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin</a>
<a id='line_5676'>      do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.</a>

<a id='line_5678'></a>

<a id='line_5680'>      Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are</a>
<a id='line_5681'>      married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.</a>

<a id='line_5688'>      BENEDICK.</a>
<a id='line_5689'>      First, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad;</a>
<a id='line_5690'>      get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverent</a>
<a id='line_5691'>      than one tipped with horn.</a>
