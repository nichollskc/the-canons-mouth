<a id='line_11'>      to the victorious Turks; whose domestic slavery was ennobled by</a>
<a id='line_12'>      martial discipline, religious enthusiasm, and the energy of the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      national character. The rise and progress of the Ottomans, the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      present sovereigns of Constantinople, are connected with the most</a>
<a id='line_15'>      important scenes of modern history; but they are founded on a</a>
<a id='line_16'>      previous knowledge of the great eruption of the Moguls 100 and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Tartars; whose rapid conquests may be compared with the primitive</a>
<a id='line_18'>      convulsions of nature, which have agitated and altered the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      surface of the globe. I have long since asserted my claim to</a>

<a id='line_35'>      time when I entertained the wish, rather than the hope, of</a>

<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>      From the spacious highlands between China, Siberia, and the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      Caspian Sea, the tide of emigration and war has repeatedly been</a>
<a id='line_40'>      poured. These ancient seats of the Huns and Turks were occupied</a>
<a id='line_41'>      in the twelfth century by many pastoral tribes, of the same</a>
<a id='line_42'>      descent and similar manners, which were united and led to</a>
<a id='line_43'>      conquest by the formidable Zingis. 101 In his ascent to</a>
<a id='line_44'>      greatness, that Barbarian (whose private appellation was Temugin)</a>
<a id='line_45'>      had trampled on the necks of his equals. His birth was noble; but</a>
<a id='line_46'>      it was the pride of victory, that the prince or people deduced</a>
<a id='line_47'>      his seventh ancestor from the immaculate conception of a virgin.</a>
<a id='line_48'>      His father had reigned over thirteen hordes, which composed about</a>
<a id='line_49'>      thirty or forty thousand families: above two thirds refused to</a>
<a id='line_50'>      pay tithes or obedience to his infant son; and at the age of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      thirteen, Temugin fought a battle against his rebellious</a>
<a id='line_52'>      subjects. The future conqueror of Asia was reduced to fly and to</a>
<a id='line_53'>      obey; but he rose superior to his fortune, and in his fortieth</a>
<a id='line_54'>      year he had established his fame and dominion over the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      circumjacent tribes. In a state of society, in which policy is</a>
<a id='line_56'>      rude and valor is universal, the ascendant of one man must be</a>
<a id='line_57'>      founded on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and</a>
<a id='line_58'>      recompense his friends. His first military league was ratified by</a>
<a id='line_59'>      the simple rites of sacrificing a horse and tasting of a running</a>
<a id='line_60'>      stream: Temugin pledged himself to divide with his followers the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      sweets and the bitters of life; and when he had shared among them</a>
<a id='line_62'>      his horses and apparel, he was rich in their gratitude and his</a>
<a id='line_63'>      own hopes. After his first victory, he placed seventy caldrons on</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the fire, and seventy of the most guilty rebels were cast</a>
<a id='line_65'>      headlong into the boiling water. The sphere of his attraction was</a>
<a id='line_66'>      continually enlarged by the ruin of the proud and the submission</a>
<a id='line_67'>      of the prudent; and the boldest chieftains might tremble, when</a>
<a id='line_68'>      they beheld, enchased in silver, the skull of the khan of</a>
<a id='line_69'>      Keraites; 2 who, under the name of Prester John, had corresponded</a>
<a id='line_70'>      with the Roman pontiff and the princes of Europe. The ambition of</a>
<a id='line_71'>      Temugin condescended to employ the arts of superstition; and it</a>
<a id='line_72'>      was from a naked prophet, who could ascend to heaven on a white</a>
<a id='line_73'>      horse, that he accepted the title of Zingis, 3 the _most great_;</a>
<a id='line_74'>      and a divine right to the conquest and dominion of the earth. In</a>
<a id='line_75'>      a general _couroultai_, or diet, he was seated on a felt, which</a>
<a id='line_76'>      was long afterwards revered as a relic, and solemnly proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_77'>      great khan, or emperor of the Moguls 4 and Tartars. 5 Of these</a>

<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>      The code of laws which Zingis dictated to his subjects was</a>
<a id='line_125'>      adapted to the preservation of a domestic peace, and the exercise</a>
<a id='line_126'>      of foreign hostility. The punishment of death was inflicted on</a>
<a id='line_127'>      the crimes of adultery, murder, perjury, and the capital thefts</a>
<a id='line_128'>      of a horse or ox; and the fiercest of men were mild and just in</a>
<a id='line_129'>      their intercourse with each other. The future election of the</a>
<a id='line_130'>      great khan was vested in the princes of his family and the heads</a>
<a id='line_131'>      of the tribes; and the regulations of the chase were essential to</a>
<a id='line_132'>      the pleasures and plenty of a Tartar camp. The victorious nation</a>
<a id='line_133'>      was held sacred from all servile labors, which were abandoned to</a>
<a id='line_134'>      slaves and strangers; and every labor was servile except the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      profession of arms. The service and discipline of the troops, who</a>
<a id='line_136'>      were armed with bows, cimeters, and iron maces, and divided by</a>
<a id='line_137'>      hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands, were the institutions of</a>
<a id='line_138'>      a veteran commander. Each officer and soldier was made</a>
<a id='line_139'>      responsible, under pain of death, for the safety and honor of his</a>
<a id='line_140'>      companions; and the spirit of conquest breathed in the law, that</a>
<a id='line_141'>      peace should never be granted unless to a vanquished and</a>
<a id='line_142'>      suppliant enemy. But it is the religion of Zingis that best</a>
<a id='line_143'>      deserves our wonder and applause. 501 The Catholic inquisitors of</a>
<a id='line_144'>      Europe, who defended nonsense by cruelty, might have been</a>
<a id='line_145'>      confounded by the example of a Barbarian, who anticipated the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      lessons of philosophy, 6 and established by his laws a system of</a>
<a id='line_147'>      pure theism and perfect toleration. His first and only article of</a>
<a id='line_148'>      faith was the existence of one God, the Author of all good; who</a>
<a id='line_149'>      fills by his presence the heavens and earth, which he has created</a>
<a id='line_150'>      by his power. The Tartars and Moguls were addicted to the idols</a>
<a id='line_151'>      of their peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted by</a>
<a id='line_152'>      the foreign missionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mahomet,</a>
<a id='line_153'>      and of Christ. These various systems in freedom and concord were</a>
<a id='line_154'>      taught and practised within the precincts of the same camp; and</a>
<a id='line_155'>      the Bonze, the Imam, the Rabbi, the Nestorian, and the Latin</a>
<a id='line_156'>      priest, enjoyed the same honorable exemption from service and</a>
<a id='line_157'>      tribute: in the mosque of Bochara, the insolent victor might</a>
<a id='line_158'>      trample the Koran under his horse’s feet, but the calm legislator</a>
<a id='line_159'>      respected the prophets and pontiffs of the most hostile sects.</a>
<a id='line_160'>      The reason of Zingis was not informed by books: the khan could</a>
<a id='line_161'>      neither read nor write; and, except the tribe of the Igours, the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      greatest part of the Moguls and Tartars were as illiterate as</a>
<a id='line_163'>      their sovereign. 601 The memory of their exploits was preserved</a>
<a id='line_164'>      by tradition: sixty-eight years after the death of Zingis, these</a>
<a id='line_165'>      traditions were collected and transcribed; 7 the brevity of their</a>
<a id='line_166'>      domestic annals may be supplied by the Chinese, 8 Persians, 9</a>

<a id='line_349'>      unworthy, and by degrees a fruitless, abuse of the virtue of his</a>

<a id='line_388'>      on a mountain, that the Mogul emperor appealed to the judgment of</a>
<a id='line_389'>      God and his sword. Our European battles, says a philosophic</a>
<a id='line_390'>      writer, 20 are petty skirmishes, if compared to the numbers that</a>
<a id='line_391'>      have fought and fallen in the fields of Asia. Seven hundred</a>
<a id='line_392'>      thousand Moguls and Tartars are said to have marched under the</a>
<a id='line_393'>      standard of Zingis and his four sons. In the vast plains that</a>
<a id='line_394'>      extend to the north of the Sihon or Jaxartes, they were</a>
<a id='line_395'>      encountered by four hundred thousand soldiers of the sultan; and</a>
<a id='line_396'>      in the first battle, which was suspended by the night, one</a>
<a id='line_397'>      hundred and sixty thousand Carizmians were slain. Mohammed was</a>
<a id='line_398'>      astonished by the multitude and valor of his enemies: he withdrew</a>
<a id='line_399'>      from the scene of danger, and distributed his troops in the</a>
<a id='line_400'>      frontier towns; trusting that the Barbarians, invincible in the</a>
<a id='line_401'>      field, would be repulsed by the length and difficulty of so many</a>
<a id='line_402'>      regular sieges. But the prudence of Zingis had formed a body of</a>
<a id='line_403'>      Chinese engineers, skilled in the mechanic arts; informed perhaps</a>
<a id='line_404'>      of the secret of gunpowder, and capable, under his discipline, of</a>
<a id='line_405'>      attacking a foreign country with more vigor and success than they</a>
<a id='line_406'>      had defended their own. The Persian historians will relate the</a>

<a id='line_409'>      conquest of the rich and populous countries of Transoxiana,</a>
<a id='line_410'>      Carizme, and Chorazan. 204 The destructive hostilities of Attila</a>
<a id='line_411'>      and the Huns have long since been elucidated by the example of</a>
<a id='line_412'>      Zingis and the Moguls; and in this more proper place I shall be</a>
<a id='line_413'>      content to observe, that, from the Caspian to the Indus, they</a>
<a id='line_414'>      ruined a tract of many hundred miles, which was adorned with the</a>
<a id='line_415'>      habitations and labors of mankind, and that five centuries have</a>
<a id='line_416'>      not been sufficient to repair the ravages of four years. The</a>
<a id='line_417'>      Mogul emperor encouraged or indulged the fury of his troops: the</a>
<a id='line_418'>      hope of future possession was lost in the ardor of rapine and</a>
<a id='line_419'>      slaughter; and the cause of the war exasperated their native</a>
<a id='line_420'>      fierceness by the pretence of justice and revenge. The downfall</a>
<a id='line_421'>      and death of the sultan Mohammed, who expired, unpitied and</a>
<a id='line_422'>      alone, in a desert island of the Caspian Sea, is a poor atonement</a>
<a id='line_423'>      for the calamities of which he was the author. Could the</a>
<a id='line_424'>      Carizmian empire have been saved by a single hero, it would have</a>
<a id='line_425'>      been saved by his son Gelaleddin, whose active valor repeatedly</a>
<a id='line_426'>      checked the Moguls in the career of victory. Retreating, as he</a>
<a id='line_427'>      fought, to the banks of the Indus, he was oppressed by their</a>
<a id='line_428'>      innumerable host, till, in the last moment of despair, Gelaleddin</a>
<a id='line_429'>      spurred his horse into the waves, swam one of the broadest and</a>
<a id='line_430'>      most rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and</a>
<a id='line_431'>      applause of Zingis himself. It was in this camp that the Mogul</a>
<a id='line_432'>      conqueror yielded with reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and</a>
<a id='line_433'>      wealthy troops, who sighed for the enjoyment of their native</a>
<a id='line_434'>      land. Eucumbered with the spoils of Asia, he slowly measured back</a>
<a id='line_435'>      his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the misery of the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      vanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the cities</a>
<a id='line_437'>      which had been swept away by the tempest of his arms. After he</a>
<a id='line_438'>      had repassed the Oxus and Jaxartes, he was joined by two</a>
<a id='line_439'>      generals, whom he had detached with thirty thousand horse, to</a>
<a id='line_440'>      subdue the western provinces of Persia. They had trampled on the</a>
<a id='line_441'>      nations which opposed their passage, penetrated through the gates</a>
<a id='line_442'>      of Derbent, traversed the Volga and the desert, and accomplished</a>
<a id='line_443'>      the circuit of the Caspian Sea, by an expedition which had never</a>
<a id='line_444'>      been attempted, and has never been repeated. The return of Zingis</a>
<a id='line_445'>      was signalized by the overthrow of the rebellious or independent</a>
<a id='line_446'>      kingdoms of Tartary; and he died in the fulness of years and</a>

<a id='line_494'>      empires or dynasties of the North and South; 22 and the</a>
<a id='line_495'>      difference of origin and interest was smoothed by a general</a>
<a id='line_496'>      conformity of laws, language, and national manners. The Northern</a>
<a id='line_497'>      empire, which had been dismembered by Zingis, was finally subdued</a>
<a id='line_498'>      seven years after his death. After the loss of Pekin, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_499'>      had fixed his residence at Kaifong, a city many leagues in</a>
<a id='line_500'>      circumference, and which contained, according to the Chinese</a>
<a id='line_501'>      annals, fourteen hundred thousand families of inhabitants and</a>
<a id='line_502'>      fugitives. He escaped from thence with only seven horsemen, and</a>
<a id='line_503'>      made his last stand in a third capital, till at length the</a>
<a id='line_504'>      hopeless monarch, protesting his innocence and accusing his</a>
<a id='line_505'>      fortune, ascended a funeral pile, and gave orders, that, as soon</a>
<a id='line_506'>      as he had stabbed himself, the fire should be kindled by his</a>
<a id='line_507'>      attendants. The dynasty of the _Song_, the native and ancient</a>
<a id='line_508'>      sovereigns of the whole empire, survived about forty-five years</a>
<a id='line_509'>      the fall of the Northern usurpers; and the perfect conquest was</a>
<a id='line_510'>      reserved for the arms of Cublai. During this interval, the Moguls</a>
<a id='line_511'>      were often diverted by foreign wars; and, if the Chinese seldom</a>
<a id='line_512'>      dared to meet their victors in the field, their passive courage</a>
<a id='line_513'>      presented and endless succession of cities to storm and of</a>
<a id='line_514'>      millions to slaughter. In the attack and defence of places, the</a>
<a id='line_515'>      engines of antiquity and the Greek fire were alternately</a>
<a id='line_516'>      employed: the use of gunpowder in cannon and bombs appears as a</a>
<a id='line_517'>      familiar practice; 23 and the sieges were conducted by the</a>
<a id='line_518'>      Mahometans and Franks, who had been liberally invited into the</a>
<a id='line_519'>      service of Cublai. After passing the great river, the troops and</a>
<a id='line_520'>      artillery were conveyed along a series of canals, till they</a>
<a id='line_521'>      invested the royal residence of Hamcheu, or Quinsay, in the</a>
<a id='line_522'>      country of silk, the most delicious climate of China. The</a>
<a id='line_523'>      emperor, a defenceless youth, surrendered his person and sceptre;</a>
<a id='line_524'>      and before he was sent in exile into Tartary, he struck nine</a>
<a id='line_525'>      times the ground with his forehead, to adore in prayer or</a>
<a id='line_526'>      thanksgiving the mercy of the great khan. Yet the war (it was now</a>
<a id='line_527'>      styled a rebellion) was still maintained in the southern</a>
<a id='line_528'>      provinces from Hamcheu to Canton; and the obstinate remnant of</a>
<a id='line_529'>      independence and hostility was transported from the land to the</a>
<a id='line_530'>      sea. But when the fleet of the _Song_ was surrounded and</a>
<a id='line_531'>      oppressed by a superior armament, their last champion leaped into</a>
<a id='line_532'>      the waves with his infant emperor in his arms. “It is more</a>
<a id='line_533'>      glorious,” he cried, “to die a prince, than to live a slave.” A</a>
<a id='line_534'>      hundred thousand Chinese imitated his example; and the whole</a>
<a id='line_535'>      empire, from Tonkin to the great wall, submitted to the dominion</a>
<a id='line_536'>      of Cublai. His boundless ambition aspired to the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_537'>      Japan: his fleet was twice shipwrecked; and the lives of a</a>
<a id='line_538'>      hundred thousand Moguls and Chinese were sacrificed in the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      fruitless expedition. But the circumjacent kingdoms, Corea,</a>
<a id='line_540'>      Tonkin, Cochinchina, Pegu, Bengal, and Thibet, were reduced in</a>
<a id='line_541'>      different degrees of tribute and obedience by the effort or</a>
<a id='line_542'>      terror of his arms. He explored the Indian Ocean with a fleet of</a>
<a id='line_543'>      a thousand ships: they sailed in sixty-eight days, most probably</a>
<a id='line_544'>      to the Isle of Borneo, under the equinoctial line; and though</a>
<a id='line_545'>      they returned not without spoil or glory, the emperor was</a>
<a id='line_546'>      dissatisfied that the savage king had escaped from their hands.</a>

<a id='line_579'>      II. The conquest of Hindostan by the Moguls was reserved in a</a>
<a id='line_580'>      later period for the house of Timour; but that of Iran, or</a>
<a id='line_581'>      Persia, was achieved by Holagou Khan, 231 the grandson of Zingis,</a>
<a id='line_582'>      the brother and lieutenant of the two successive emperors, Mangou</a>
<a id='line_583'>      and Cublai. I shall not enumerate the crowd of sultans, emirs,</a>
<a id='line_584'>      and atabeks, whom he trampled into dust; but the extirpation of</a>
<a id='line_585'>      the _Assassins_, or Ismaelians 24 of Persia, may be considered as</a>
<a id='line_586'>      a service to mankind. Among the hills to the south of the</a>
<a id='line_587'>      Caspian, these odious sectaries had reigned with impunity above a</a>
<a id='line_588'>      hundred and sixty years; and their prince, or Imam, established</a>
<a id='line_589'>      his lieutenant to lead and govern the colony of Mount Libanus, so</a>
<a id='line_590'>      famous and formidable in the history of the crusades. 25 With the</a>
<a id='line_591'>      fanaticism of the Koran the Ismaelians had blended the Indian</a>
<a id='line_592'>      transmigration, and the visions of their own prophets; and it was</a>
<a id='line_593'>      their first duty to devote their souls and bodies in blind</a>
<a id='line_594'>      obedience to the vicar of God. The daggers of his missionaries</a>
<a id='line_595'>      were felt both in the East and West: the Christians and the</a>
<a id='line_596'>      Moslems enumerate, and persons multiply, the illustrious victims</a>
<a id='line_597'>      that were sacrificed to the zeal, avarice, or resentment of _the</a>
<a id='line_598'>      old man_ (as he was corruptly styled) _of the mountain_. But</a>
<a id='line_599'>      these daggers, his only arms, were broken by the sword of</a>
<a id='line_600'>      Holagou, and not a vestige is left of the enemies of mankind,</a>
<a id='line_601'>      except the word _assassin_, which, in the most odious sense, has</a>
<a id='line_602'>      been adopted in the languages of Europe. The extinction of the</a>
<a id='line_603'>      Abbassides cannot be indifferent to the spectators of their</a>
<a id='line_604'>      greatness and decline. Since the fall of their Seljukian tyrants</a>
<a id='line_605'>      the caliphs had recovered their lawful dominion of Bagdad and the</a>
<a id='line_606'>      Arabian Irak; but the city was distracted by theological</a>
<a id='line_607'>      factions, and the commander of the faithful was lost in a harem</a>
<a id='line_608'>      of seven hundred concubines. The invasion of the Moguls he</a>
<a id='line_609'>      encountered with feeble arms and haughty embassies. “On the</a>
<a id='line_610'>      divine decree,” said the caliph Mostasem, “is founded the throne</a>
<a id='line_611'>      of the sons of Abbas: and their foes shall surely be destroyed in</a>
<a id='line_612'>      this world and in the next. Who is this Holagou that dares to</a>
<a id='line_613'>      rise against them? If he be desirous of peace, let him instantly</a>
<a id='line_614'>      depart from the sacred territory; and perhaps he may obtain from</a>
<a id='line_615'>      our clemency the pardon of his fault.” This presumption was</a>
<a id='line_616'>      cherished by a perfidious vizier, who assured his master, that,</a>
<a id='line_617'>      even if the Barbarians had entered the city, the women and</a>
<a id='line_618'>      children, from the terraces, would be sufficient to overwhelm</a>
<a id='line_619'>      them with stones. But when Holagou touched the phantom, it</a>
<a id='line_620'>      instantly vanished into smoke. After a siege of two months,</a>
<a id='line_621'>      Bagdad was stormed and sacked by the Moguls; 251 and their savage</a>
<a id='line_622'>      commander pronounced the death of the caliph Mostasem, the last</a>
<a id='line_623'>      of the temporal successors of Mahomet; whose noble kinsmen, of</a>
<a id='line_624'>      the race of Abbas, had reigned in Asia above five hundred years.</a>
<a id='line_625'>      Whatever might be the designs of the conqueror, the holy cities</a>
<a id='line_626'>      of Mecca and Medina 26 were protected by the Arabian desert; but</a>
<a id='line_627'>      the Moguls spread beyond the Tigris and Euphrates, pillaged</a>
<a id='line_628'>      Aleppo and Damascus, and threatened to join the Franks in the</a>
<a id='line_629'>      deliverance of Jerusalem. Egypt was lost, had she been defended</a>
<a id='line_630'>      only by her feeble offspring; but the Mamalukes had breathed in</a>
<a id='line_631'>      their infancy the keenness of a Scythian air: equal in valor,</a>
<a id='line_632'>      superior in discipline, they met the Moguls in many a well-fought</a>

<a id='line_634'>      the Euphrates. 261 But it overflowed with resistless violence the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      kingdoms of Armenia 262 and Anatolia, of which the former was</a>

<a id='line_679'>      of the West. Fifteen hundred thousand Moguls and Tartars were</a>
<a id='line_680'>      inscribed on the military roll: of these the great khan selected</a>
<a id='line_681'>      a third, which he intrusted to the command of his nephew Batou,</a>

<a id='line_683'>      north of the Caspian Sea. 264 After a festival of forty days,</a>
<a id='line_684'>      Batou set forwards on this great expedition; and such was the</a>
<a id='line_685'>      speed and ardor of his innumerable squadrons, than in less than</a>
<a id='line_686'>      six years they had measured a line of ninety degrees of</a>
<a id='line_687'>      longitude, a fourth part of the circumference of the globe. The</a>
<a id='line_688'>      great rivers of Asia and Europe, the Volga and Kama, the Don and</a>
<a id='line_689'>      Borysthenes, the Vistula and Danube, they either swam with their</a>
<a id='line_690'>      horses or passed on the ice, or traversed in leathern boats,</a>
<a id='line_691'>      which followed the camp, and transported their wagons and</a>
<a id='line_692'>      artillery. By the first victories of Batou, the remains of</a>
<a id='line_693'>      national freedom were eradicated in the immense plains of</a>
<a id='line_694'>      Turkestan and Kipzak. 27 In his rapid progress, he overran the</a>
<a id='line_695'>      kingdoms, as they are now styled, of Astracan and Cazan; and the</a>
<a id='line_696'>      troops which he detached towards Mount Caucasus explored the most</a>
<a id='line_697'>      secret recesses of Georgia and Circassia. The civil discord of</a>
<a id='line_698'>      the great dukes, or princes, of Russia, betrayed their country to</a>
<a id='line_699'>      the Tartars. They spread from Livonia to the Black Sea, and both</a>
<a id='line_700'>      Moscow and Kiow, the modern and the ancient capitals, were</a>
<a id='line_701'>      reduced to ashes; a temporary ruin, less fatal than the deep, and</a>
<a id='line_702'>      perhaps indelible, mark, which a servitude of two hundred years</a>
<a id='line_703'>      has imprinted on the character of the Russians. The Tartars</a>
<a id='line_704'>      ravaged with equal fury the countries which they hoped to</a>
<a id='line_705'>      possess, and those which they were hastening to leave. From the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      permanent conquest of Russia they made a deadly, though</a>
<a id='line_707'>      transient, inroad into the heart of Poland, and as far as the</a>
<a id='line_708'>      borders of Germany. The cities of Lublin and Cracow were</a>
<a id='line_709'>      obliterated: 271 they approached the shores of the Baltic; and in</a>
<a id='line_710'>      the battle of Lignitz they defeated the dukes of Silesia, the</a>
<a id='line_711'>      Polish palatines, and the great master of the Teutonic order, and</a>
<a id='line_712'>      filled nine sacks with the right ears of the slain. From Lignitz,</a>
<a id='line_713'>      the extreme point of their western march, they turned aside to</a>
<a id='line_714'>      the invasion of Hungary; and the presence or spirit of Batou</a>
<a id='line_715'>      inspired the host of five hundred thousand men: the Carpathian</a>
<a id='line_716'>      hills could not be long impervious to their divided columns; and</a>
<a id='line_717'>      their approach had been fondly disbelieved till it was</a>
<a id='line_718'>      irresistibly felt. The king, Bela the Fourth, assembled the</a>
<a id='line_719'>      military force of his counts and bishops; but he had alienated</a>
<a id='line_720'>      the nation by adopting a vagrant horde of forty thousand families</a>
<a id='line_721'>      of Comans, and these savage guests were provoked to revolt by the</a>
<a id='line_722'>      suspicion of treachery and the murder of their prince. The whole</a>
<a id='line_723'>      country north of the Danube was lost in a day, and depopulated in</a>
<a id='line_724'>      a summer; and the ruins of cities and churches were overspread</a>
<a id='line_725'>      with the bones of the natives, who expiated the sins of their</a>
<a id='line_726'>      Turkish ancestors. An ecclesiastic, who fled from the sack of</a>
<a id='line_727'>      Waradin, describes the calamities which he had seen, or suffered;</a>
<a id='line_728'>      and the sanguinary rage of sieges and battles is far less</a>
<a id='line_729'>      atrocious than the treatment of the fugitives, who had been</a>
<a id='line_730'>      allured from the woods under a promise of peace and pardon and</a>
<a id='line_731'>      who were coolly slaughtered as soon as they had performed the</a>
<a id='line_732'>      labors of the harvest and vintage. In the winter the Tartars</a>
<a id='line_733'>      passed the Danube on the ice, and advanced to Gran or Strigonium,</a>
<a id='line_734'>      a German colony, and the metropolis of the kingdom. Thirty</a>
<a id='line_735'>      engines were planted against the walls; the ditches were filled</a>
<a id='line_736'>      with sacks of earth and dead bodies; and after a promiscuous</a>
<a id='line_737'>      massacre, three hundred noble matrons were slain in the presence</a>

<a id='line_839'>      the kings of Georgia and Armenia, the sultans of Iconium, and the</a>
<a id='line_840'>      emirs of Persia, were decided by the frown or smile of the great</a>
<a id='line_841'>      khan. The sons and grandsons of Zingis had been accustomed to the</a>
<a id='line_842'>      pastoral life; but the village of Caracorum 31 was gradually</a>
<a id='line_843'>      ennobled by their election and residence. A change of manners is</a>
<a id='line_844'>      implied in the removal of Octai and Mangou from a tent to a</a>
<a id='line_845'>      house; and their example was imitated by the princes of their</a>
<a id='line_846'>      family and the great officers of the empire. Instead of the</a>
<a id='line_847'>      boundless forest, the enclosure of a park afforded the more</a>
<a id='line_848'>      indolent pleasures of the chase; their new habitations were</a>
<a id='line_849'>      decorated with painting and sculpture; their superfluous</a>
<a id='line_850'>      treasures were cast in fountains, and basins, and statues of</a>
<a id='line_851'>      massy silver; and the artists of China and Paris vied with each</a>
<a id='line_852'>      other in the service of the great khan. 32 Caracorum contained</a>
<a id='line_853'>      two streets, the one of Chinese mechanics, the other of Mahometan</a>
<a id='line_854'>      traders; and the places of religious worship, one Nestorian</a>
<a id='line_855'>      church, two mosques, and twelve temples of various idols, may</a>
<a id='line_856'>      represent in some degree the number and division of inhabitants.</a>
<a id='line_857'>      Yet a French missionary declares, that the town of St. Denys,</a>
<a id='line_858'>      near Paris, was more considerable than the Tartar capital; and</a>
<a id='line_859'>      that the whole palace of Mangou was scarcely equal to a tenth</a>
<a id='line_860'>      part of that Benedictine abbey. The conquests of Russia and Syria</a>
<a id='line_861'>      might amuse the vanity of the great khans; but they were seated</a>
<a id='line_862'>      on the borders of China; the acquisition of that empire was the</a>
<a id='line_863'>      nearest and most interesting object; and they might learn from</a>
<a id='line_864'>      their pastoral economy, that it is for the advantage of the</a>
<a id='line_865'>      shepherd to protect and propagate his flock. I have already</a>
<a id='line_866'>      celebrated the wisdom and virtue of a Mandarin who prevented the</a>
<a id='line_867'>      desolation of five populous and cultivated provinces. In a</a>
<a id='line_868'>      spotless administration of thirty years, this friend of his</a>
<a id='line_869'>      country and of mankind continually labored to mitigate, or</a>
<a id='line_870'>      suspend, the havoc of war; to save the monuments, and to rekindle</a>
<a id='line_871'>      the flame, of science; to restrain the military commander by the</a>
<a id='line_872'>      restoration of civil magistrates; and to instil the love of peace</a>
<a id='line_873'>      and justice into the minds of the Moguls. He struggled with the</a>
<a id='line_874'>      barbarism of the first conquerors; but his salutary lessons</a>
<a id='line_875'>      produced a rich harvest in the second generation. 321 The</a>
<a id='line_876'>      northern, and by degrees the southern, empire acquiesced in the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      government of Cublai, the lieutenant, and afterwards the</a>
<a id='line_878'>      successor, of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who</a>
<a id='line_879'>      had been educated in the manners of China. He restored the forms</a>
<a id='line_880'>      of her venerable constitution; and the victors submitted to the</a>
<a id='line_881'>      laws, the fashions, and even the prejudices, of the vanquished</a>
<a id='line_882'>      people. This peaceful triumph, which has been more than once</a>
<a id='line_883'>      repeated, may be ascribed, in a great measure, to the numbers and</a>
<a id='line_884'>      servitude of the Chinese. The Mogul army was dissolved in a vast</a>
<a id='line_885'>      and populous country; and their emperors adopted with pleasure a</a>
<a id='line_886'>      political system, which gives to the prince the solid substance</a>
<a id='line_887'>      of despotism, and leaves to the subject the empty names of</a>
<a id='line_888'>      philosophy, freedom, and filial obedience. 322 Under the reign of</a>
<a id='line_889'>      Cublai, letters and commerce, peace and justice, were restored;</a>
<a id='line_890'>      the great canal, of five hundred miles, was opened from Nankin to</a>
<a id='line_891'>      the capital: he fixed his residence at Pekin; and displayed in</a>
<a id='line_892'>      his court the magnificence of the greatest monarch of Asia. Yet</a>
<a id='line_893'>      this learned prince declined from the pure and simple religion of</a>
<a id='line_894'>      his great ancestor: he sacrificed to the idol Fo; and his blind</a>
<a id='line_895'>      attachment to the lamas of Thibet and the bonzes of China 33</a>
<a id='line_896'>      provoked the censure of the disciples of Confucius. His</a>
<a id='line_897'>      successors polluted the palace with a crowd of eunuchs,</a>
<a id='line_898'>      physicians, and astrologers, while thirteen millions of their</a>
<a id='line_899'>      subjects were consumed in the provinces by famine. One hundred</a>
<a id='line_900'>      and forty years after the death of Zingis, his degenerate race,</a>
<a id='line_901'>      the dynasty of the Yuen, was expelled by a revolt of the native</a>
<a id='line_902'>      Chinese; and the Mogul emperors were lost in the oblivion of the</a>
<a id='line_903'>      desert. Before this revolution, they had forfeited their</a>
<a id='line_904'>      supremacy over the dependent branches of their house, the khans</a>
<a id='line_905'>      of Kipzak and Russia, the khans of Zagatai, or Transoxiana, and</a>
<a id='line_906'>      the khans of Iran or Persia. By their distance and power, these</a>
<a id='line_907'>      royal lieutenants had soon been released from the duties of</a>
<a id='line_908'>      obedience; and after the death of Cublai, they scorned to accept</a>
<a id='line_909'>      a sceptre or a title from his unworthy successors. According to</a>
<a id='line_910'>      their respective situations, they maintained the simplicity of</a>

<a id='line_960'>      expedition death surprised him in full march to attack the</a>

<a id='line_964'>      latitude, where he numbered the inhabitants and regulated the</a>

<a id='line_969'>      recovery of Constantinople, Michael Palæologus, 35 at a distance</a>
<a id='line_970'>      from his court and army, was surprised and surrounded in a</a>
<a id='line_971'>      Thracian castle, by twenty thousand Tartars. But the object of</a>
<a id='line_972'>      their march was a private interest: they came to the deliverance</a>
<a id='line_973'>      of Azzadin, the Turkish sultan; and were content with his person</a>
<a id='line_974'>      and the treasure of the emperor. Their general Noga, whose name</a>

<a id='line_992'>      the citizens of Nice will present an image of the terror which he</a>
<a id='line_993'>      had inspired. The accident of a procession, and the sound of a</a>
<a id='line_994'>      doleful litany, “From the fury of the Tartars, good Lord, deliver</a>
<a id='line_995'>      us,” had scattered the hasty report of an assault and massacre.</a>
<a id='line_996'>      In the blind credulity of fear, the streets of Nice were crowded</a>
<a id='line_997'>      with thousands of both sexes, who knew not from what or to whom</a>
<a id='line_998'>      they fled; and some hours elapsed before the firmness of the</a>

<a id='line_1000'>      But the ambition of Holagou and his successors was fortunately</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      diverted by the conquest of Bagdad, and a long vicissitude of</a>

<a id='line_1072'>      the Sangar, a camp of four hundred families or tents, whom he</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      governed fifty-two years both in peace and war. He was the father</a>

<a id='line_1079'>      soldier; and the circumstances of time and place were propitious</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      to his independence and success. The Seljukian dynasty was no</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      more; and the distance and decline of the Mogul khans soon</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      enfranchised him from the control of a superior. He was situate</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      on the verge of the Greek empire: the Koran sanctified his</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      _gazi_, or holy war, against the infidels; and their political</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      errors unlocked the passes of Mount Olympus, and invited him to</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      descend into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      Palæologus, these passes had been vigilantly guarded by the</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      militia of the country, who were repaid by their own safety and</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      an exemption from taxes. The emperor abolished their privilege</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      and assumed their office; but the tribute was rigorously</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      collected, the custody of the passes was neglected, and the hardy</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of peasants</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      without spirit or discipline. It was on the twenty-seventh of</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      July, in the year twelve hundred and ninety-nine of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      æra, that Othman first invaded the territory of Nicomedia; 40 and</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      the singular accuracy of the date seems to disclose some</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      foresight of the rapid and destructive growth of the monster. The</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      annals of the twenty-seven years of his reign would exhibit a</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      repetition of the same inroads; and his hereditary troops were</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      multiplied in each campaign by the accession of captives and</a>
<a id='line_1101'>      volunteers. Instead of retreating to the hills, he maintained the</a>
<a id='line_1102'>      most useful and defensive posts; fortified the towns and castles</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      which he had first pillaged; and renounced the pastoral life for</a>

<a id='line_1106'>      welcome news of the conquest of Prusa, which had been surrendered</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      by famine or treachery to the arms of his son Orchan. The glory</a>

<a id='line_1160'>      From the conquest of Prusa, we may date the true æra of the</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      Ottoman empire. The lives and possessions of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      subjects were redeemed by a tribute or ransom of thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      crowns of gold; and the city, by the labors of Orchan, assumed</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      the aspect of a Mahometan capital; Prusa was decorated with a</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      mosque, a college, and a hospital, of royal foundation; the</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      Seljukian coin was changed for the name and impression of the new</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      dynasty: and the most skilful professors, of human and divine</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      knowledge, attracted the Persian and Arabian students from the</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      ancient schools of Oriental learning. The office of vizier was</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      instituted for Aladin, the brother of Orchan; 411 and a different</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      habit distinguished the citizens from the peasants, the Moslems</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      from the infidels. All the troops of Othman had consisted of</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      loose squadrons of Turkman cavalry; who served without pay and</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      fought without discipline: but a regular body of infantry was</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      first established and trained by the prudence of his son. A great</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      number of volunteers was enrolled with a small stipend, but with</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      the permission of living at home, unless they were summoned to</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      the field: their rude manners, and seditious temper, disposed</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      Orchan to educate his young captives as his soldiers and those of</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      the prophet; but the Turkish peasants were still allowed to mount</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      on horseback, and follow his standard, with the appellation and</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      the hopes of _freebooters_. 412 By these arts he formed an army</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      of twenty-five thousand Moslems: a train of battering engines was</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      framed for the use of sieges; and the first successful experiment</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      was made on the cities of Nice and Nicomedia. Orchan granted a</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      safe-conduct to all who were desirous of departing with their</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      families and effects; but the widows of the slain were given in</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      marriage to the conquerors; and the sacrilegious plunder, the</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      books, the vases, and the images, were sold or ransomed at</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      Constantinople. The emperor Andronicus the Younger was vanquished</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      and wounded by the son of Othman: 42 421 he subdued the whole</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      province or kingdom of Bithynia, as far as the shores of the</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the Christians confessed the</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      justice and clemency of a reign which claimed the voluntary</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      attachment of the Turks of Asia. Yet Orchan was content with the</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      modest title of emir; and in the list of his compeers, the</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      princes of Roum or Anatolia, 43 his military forces were</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      surpassed by the emirs of Ghermian and Caramania, each of whom</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      could bring into the field an army of forty thousand men. Their</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      domains were situate in the heart of the Seljukian kingdom; but</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      the holy warriors, though of inferior note, who formed new</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      principalities on the Greek empire, are more conspicuous in the</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      light of history. The maritime country from the Propontis to the</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      Mæander and the Isle of Rhodes, so long threatened and so often</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      pillaged, was finally lost about the thirteenth year of</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      Andronicus the Elder. 44 Two Turkish chieftains, Sarukhan and</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      Aidin, left their names to their conquests, and their conquests</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      to their posterity. The captivity or ruin of the _seven_ churches</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      of Asia was consummated; and the barbarous lords of Ionia and</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      Lydia still trample on the monuments of classic and Christian</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      antiquity. In the loss of Ephesus, the Christians deplored the</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      fall of the first angel, the extinction of the first candlestick,</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      of the Revelations; 45 the desolation is complete; and the temple</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      of Diana, or the church of Mary, will equally elude the search of</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      the curious traveller. The circus and three stately theatres of</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      Laodicea are now peopled with wolves and foxes; Sardes is reduced</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      to a miserable village; the God of Mahomet, without a rival or a</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      son, is invoked in the mosques of Thyatira and Pergamus; and the</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      populousness of Smyrna is supported by the foreign trade of the</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia alone has been saved by</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      prophecy, or courage. At a distance from the sea, forgotten by</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her valiant</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      citizens defended their religion and freedom above fourscore</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      years; and at length capitulated with the proudest of the</a>

<a id='line_1322'>      a prompt and powerful succor, by his situation along the</a>

<a id='line_1324'>      a more advantageous treaty, the Turkish prince of Bithynia was</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      detached from his engagements with Anne of Savoy; and the pride</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      of Orchan dictated the most solemn protestations, that if he</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      could obtain the daughter of Cantacuzene, he would invariably</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      fulfil the duties of a subject and a son. Parental tenderness was</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      silenced by the voice of ambition: the Greek clergy connived at</a>

<a id='line_1331'>      and the father of Theodora describes, with shameful satisfaction,</a>

<a id='line_1333'>      the ambassadors, who disembarked from thirty vessels, before his</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      camp of Selybria. A stately pavilion was erected, in which the</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      empress Irene passed the night with her daughters. In the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      morning, Theodora ascended a throne, which was surrounded with</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      curtains of silk and gold: the troops were under arms; but the</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      emperor alone was on horseback. At a signal the curtains were</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      suddenly withdrawn to disclose the bride, or the victim,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      encircled by kneeling eunuchs and hymeneal torches: the sound of</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      flutes and trumpets proclaimed the joyful event; and her</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      pretended happiness was the theme of the nuptial song, which was</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      chanted by such poets as the age could produce. Without the rites</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      of the church, Theodora was delivered to her barbarous lord: but</a>

<a id='line_1471'>      humble attendance of the emperor John Palæologus and his four</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      sons, who followed at his summons the court and camp of the</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      Ottoman prince. He marched against the Sclavonian nations between</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      the Danube and the Adriatic, the Bulgarians, Servians, Bosnians,</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      and Albanians; and these warlike tribes, who had so often</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      insulted the majesty of the empire, were repeatedly broken by his</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      destructive inroads. Their countries did not abound either in</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      gold or silver; nor were their rustic hamlets and townships</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      enriched by commerce or decorated by the arts of luxury. But the</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      natives of the soil have been distinguished in every age by their</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      hardiness of mind and body; and they were converted by a prudent</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      institution into the firmest and most faithful supporters of the</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      Ottoman greatness. 53 The vizier of Amurath reminded his</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      sovereign that, according to the Mahometan law, he was entitled</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      to a fifth part of the spoil and captives; and that the duty</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      might easily be levied, if vigilant officers were stationed in</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      Gallipoli, to watch the passage, and to select for his use the</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      stoutest and most beautiful of the Christian youth. The advice</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      was followed: the edict was proclaimed; many thousands of the</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      European captives were educated in religion and arms; and the new</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      militia was consecrated and named by a celebrated dervis.</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      Standing in the front of their ranks, he stretched the sleeve of</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      his gown over the head of the foremost soldier, and his blessing</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      was delivered in these words: “Let them be called Janizaries,</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      (_Yengi cheri_, or new soldiers;) may their countenance be ever</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      bright! their hand victorious! their sword keen! may their spear</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      always hang over the heads of their enemies! and wheresoever they</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      go, may they return with a _white face!_” 54 541 Such was the</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      origin of these haughty troops, the terror of the nations, and</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      sometimes of the sultans themselves. Their valor has declined,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      their discipline is relaxed, and their tumultuary array is</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      incapable of contending with the order and weapons of modern</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      tactics; but at the time of their institution, they possessed a</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      decisive superiority in war; since a regular body of infantry, in</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      constant exercise and pay, was not maintained by any of the</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      princes of Christendom. The Janizaries fought with the zeal of</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      proselytes against their _idolatrous_ countrymen; and in the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      battle of Cossova, the league and independence of the Sclavonian</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      tribes was finally crushed. As the conqueror walked over the</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      field, he observed that the greatest part of the slain consisted</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      of beardless youths; and listened to the flattering reply of his</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      vizier, that age and wisdom would have taught them not to oppose</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      his irresistible arms. But the sword of his Janizaries could not</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      defend him from the dagger of despair; a Servian soldier started</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      from the crowd of dead bodies, and Amurath was pierced in the</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      belly with a mortal wound. 542 The grandson of Othman was mild in</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      his temper, modest in his apparel, and a lover of learning and</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      virtue; but the Moslems were scandalized at his absence from</a>

<a id='line_1581'>      the Servians and Bulgarians, than he passed the Danube to seek</a>

<a id='line_1583'>      Whatever yet adhered to the Greek empire in Thrace, Macedonia,</a>

<a id='line_1587'>      who possessed the ancient seat of the oracle of Delphi, deserved</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      his favor by the sacrifice of a beauteous daughter. The Turkish</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      communication between Europe and Asia had been dangerous and</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      doubtful, till he stationed at Gallipoli a fleet of galleys, to</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      command the Hellespont and intercept the Latin succors of</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      Constantinople. While the monarch indulged his passions in a</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      boundless range of injustice and cruelty, he imposed on his</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      soldiers the most rigid laws of modesty and abstinence; and the</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      harvest was peaceably reaped and sold within the precincts of his</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      camp. Provoked by the loose and corrupt administration of</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      justice, he collected in a house the judges and lawyers of his</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      dominions, who expected that in a few moments the fire would be</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      kindled to reduce them to ashes. His ministers trembled in</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      silence: but an Æthiopian buffoon presumed to insinuate the true</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      cause of the evil; and future venality was left without excuse,</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      by annexing an adequate salary to the office of cadhi. 58 The</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      humble title of emir was no longer suitable to the Ottoman</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      greatness; and Bajazet condescended to accept a patent of sultan</a>

<a id='line_1606'>      Mamalukes: 59 a last and frivolous homage that was yielded by</a>

<a id='line_1609'>      sultan was inflamed by the obligation of deserving this august</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      title; and he turned his arms against the kingdom of Hungary, the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>      perpetual theatre of the Turkish victories and defeats.</a>
<a id='line_1612'>      Sigismond, the Hungarian king, was the son and brother of the</a>

<a id='line_1615'>      France and Germany were eager to march under his standard and</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      that of the cross. In the battle of Nicopolis, Bajazet defeated a</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      confederate army of a hundred thousand Christians, who had</a>
<a id='line_1618'>      proudly boasted, that if the sky should fall, they could uphold</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      it on their lances. The far greater part were slain or driven</a>

<a id='line_1621'>      river and the Black Sea, returned after a long circuit to his</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      exhausted kingdom. 60 In the pride of victory, Bajazet threatened</a>

<a id='line_1673'>      thousand knights and squires. 631 These splendid names were the</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      source of presumption and the bane of discipline. So many might</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      aspire to command, that none were willing to obey; their national</a>

<a id='line_1678'>      to compute how soon they should visit Constantinople and deliver</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      the holy sepulchre. When their scouts announced the approach of</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      the Turks, the gay and thoughtless youths were at table, already</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      heated with wine; they instantly clasped their armor, mounted</a>

<a id='line_1686'>      obeyed the prudence of the Hungarians; but it might have been</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      gloriously won, had the Hungarians imitated the valor of the</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      French. They dispersed the first line, consisting of the troops</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      of Asia; forced a rampart of stakes, which had been planted</a>

<a id='line_1692'>      numerous squadrons that issued from the woods, and charged on all</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      sides this handful of intrepid warriors. In the speed and secrecy</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      of his march, in the order and evolutions of the battle, his</a>

<a id='line_1700'>      were led before his throne; and, as they refused to abjure their</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      faith, were successively beheaded in his presence. The sultan was</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      exasperated by the loss of his bravest Janizaries; and if it be</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      true, that, on the eve of the engagement, the French had</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      massacred their Turkish prisoners, 64 they might impute to</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      themselves the consequences of a just retaliation. 641 A knight,</a>

<a id='line_1718'>      Lusignan presented him with a gold saltcellar of curious</a>

<a id='line_1724'>      than of art, Bajazet agreed to accept a ransom of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      thousand ducats for the count of Nevers and the surviving princes</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      and barons: the marshal Boucicault, a famous warrior, was of the</a>

<a id='line_1730'>      incidental costs, fell chiefly on the duke of Burgundy, or rather</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      on his Flemish subjects, who were bound by the feudal laws to</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      contribute for the knighthood and captivity of the eldest son of</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      their lord. For the faithful discharge of the debt, some</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      merchants of Genoa gave security to the amount of five times the</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      sum; a lesson to those warlike times, that commerce and credit</a>

<a id='line_1738'>      bear arms against the person of their conqueror; but the</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      ungenerous restraint was abolished by Bajazet himself. “I</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      despise,” said he to the heir of Burgundy, “thy oaths and thy</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      arms. Thou art young, and mayest be ambitious of effacing the</a>

<a id='line_1745'>      their departure, they were indulged in the freedom and</a>

<a id='line_1834'>      so mildly, or so unskilfully, performed, that the one retained</a>

<a id='line_1836'>      infirmity of squinting. Thus excluded from the succession, the</a>

<a id='line_1892'>      obedience almost all Asia, with many and large countries in</a>

<a id='line_1895'>      reward; or tremble, for thyself and thy unhappy people, at the</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      consequences of a rash refusal.” But his ambassadors were</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      instructed to soften their tone, and to propose a treaty, which</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      was subscribed with submission and gratitude. A truce of ten</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      years was purchased by an annual tribute of thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      crowns of gold; the Greeks deplored the public toleration of the</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      law of Mahomet, and Bajazet enjoyed the glory of establishing a</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      Turkish cadhi, and founding a royal mosque in the metropolis of</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      the Eastern church. 67 Yet this truce was soon violated by the</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      restless sultan: in the cause of the prince of Selybria, the</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      lawful emperor, an army of Ottomans again threatened</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      Constantinople; and the distress of Manuel implored the</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      protection of the king of France. His plaintive embassy obtained</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      much pity and some relief; and the conduct of the succor was</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      intrusted to the marshal Boucicault, 68 whose religious chivalry</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      was inflamed by the desire of revenging his captivity on the</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      infidels. He sailed with four ships of war, from Aiguesmortes to</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      the Hellespont; forced the passage, which was guarded by</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      seventeen Turkish galleys; landed at Constantinople a supply of</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      six hundred men-at-arms and sixteen hundred archers; and reviewed</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      them in the adjacent plain, without condescending to number or</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      array the multitude of Greeks. By his presence, the blockade was</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      raised both by sea and land; the flying squadrons of Bajazet were</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      driven to a more respectful distance; and several castles in</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      Europe and Asia were stormed by the emperor and the marshal, who</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      fought with equal valor by each other’s side. But the Ottomans</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      soon returned with an increase of numbers; and the intrepid</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      Boucicault, after a year’s struggle, resolved to evacuate a</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      country which could no longer afford either pay or provisions for</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      his soldiers. The marshal offered to conduct Manuel to the French</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      court, where he might solicit in person a supply of men and</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      money; and advised, in the mean while, that, to extinguish all</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      domestic discord, he should leave his blind competitor on the</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      throne. The proposal was embraced: the prince of Selybria was</a>

<a id='line_1930'>      the lot of the exile seemed more fortunate than that of the</a>
