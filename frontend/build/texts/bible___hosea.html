<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in</a>
<a id='line_4'>the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in</a>
<a id='line_5'>the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said</a>
<a id='line_8'>to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of</a>
<a id='line_9'>whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from</a>
<a id='line_10'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which</a>
<a id='line_13'>conceived, and bare him a son.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:4 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a</a>
<a id='line_16'>little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of</a>
<a id='line_17'>Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow</a>
<a id='line_20'>of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:6 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto</a>
<a id='line_23'>him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the</a>
<a id='line_24'>house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them</a>
<a id='line_27'>by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword,</a>
<a id='line_28'>nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:8 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:9 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and</a>
<a id='line_33'>I will not be your God.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of</a>
<a id='line_36'>the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to</a>
<a id='line_37'>pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my</a>
<a id='line_38'>people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the</a>
<a id='line_39'>living God.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be</a>
<a id='line_42'>gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_43'>come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>2:1 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>2:2 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am</a>
<a id='line_48'>I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her</a>
<a id='line_49'>sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 2:3 Lest I strip</a>
<a id='line_50'>her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her</a>
<a id='line_51'>as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with</a>
<a id='line_52'>thirst.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>2:4 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the</a>
<a id='line_55'>children of whoredoms.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>2:5 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them</a>
<a id='line_58'>hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that</a>
<a id='line_59'>give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my</a>
<a id='line_60'>drink.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>2:6 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a</a>
<a id='line_63'>wall, that she shall not find her paths.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>2:7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake</a>
<a id='line_66'>them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she</a>
<a id='line_67'>say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better</a>
<a id='line_68'>with me than now.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>2:8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and</a>
<a id='line_71'>multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>2:9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time</a>
<a id='line_74'>thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool</a>
<a id='line_75'>and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,</a>
<a id='line_78'>and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>2:11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new</a>
<a id='line_81'>moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath</a>
<a id='line_84'>said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will</a>
<a id='line_85'>make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>2:13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned</a>
<a id='line_88'>incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her</a>
<a id='line_89'>jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the</a>
<a id='line_92'>wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of</a>
<a id='line_95'>Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of</a>
<a id='line_96'>her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_97'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call</a>
<a id='line_100'>me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and</a>
<a id='line_103'>they shall no more be remembered by their name.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts</a>
<a id='line_106'>of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping</a>
<a id='line_107'>things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the</a>
<a id='line_108'>battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth</a>
<a id='line_111'>thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness,</a>
<a id='line_112'>and in mercies.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_115'>know the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>2:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the</a>
<a id='line_118'>LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; 2:22 And</a>
<a id='line_119'>the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they</a>
<a id='line_120'>shall hear Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy</a>
<a id='line_123'>upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which</a>
<a id='line_124'>were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art</a>
<a id='line_125'>my God.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>3:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her</a>
<a id='line_128'>friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward</a>
<a id='line_129'>the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of</a>
<a id='line_130'>wine.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>3:2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an</a>
<a id='line_133'>homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 3:3 And I said unto her,</a>
<a id='line_134'>Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and</a>
<a id='line_135'>thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>3:4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king,</a>
<a id='line_138'>and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image,</a>
<a id='line_139'>and without an ephod, and without teraphim: 3:5 Afterward shall the</a>
<a id='line_140'>children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David</a>
<a id='line_141'>their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter</a>
<a id='line_142'>days.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>4:1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_145'>hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is</a>
<a id='line_146'>no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>4:2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing</a>
<a id='line_149'>adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>4:3 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth</a>
<a id='line_152'>therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the</a>
<a id='line_153'>fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>4:4 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as</a>
<a id='line_156'>they that strive with the priest.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>4:5 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall</a>
<a id='line_159'>fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast</a>
<a id='line_162'>rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no</a>
<a id='line_163'>priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will</a>
<a id='line_164'>also forget thy children.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>4:7 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will</a>
<a id='line_167'>I change their glory into shame.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>4:8 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on</a>
<a id='line_170'>their iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>4:9 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish</a>
<a id='line_173'>them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>4:10 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit</a>
<a id='line_176'>whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take</a>
<a id='line_177'>heed to the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>4:11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>4:12 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth</a>
<a id='line_182'>unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and</a>
<a id='line_183'>they have gone a whoring from under their God.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>4:13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense</a>
<a id='line_186'>upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow</a>
<a id='line_187'>thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and</a>
<a id='line_188'>your spouses shall commit adultery.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>4:14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor</a>
<a id='line_191'>your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated</a>
<a id='line_192'>with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people</a>
<a id='line_193'>that doth not understand shall fall.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>4:15 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend;</a>
<a id='line_196'>and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear,</a>
<a id='line_197'>The LORD liveth.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>4:16 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD</a>
<a id='line_200'>will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>4:17 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>4:18 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:</a>
<a id='line_205'>her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>4:19 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be</a>
<a id='line_208'>ashamed because of their sacrifices.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>5:1 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give</a>
<a id='line_211'>ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye</a>
<a id='line_212'>have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>5:2 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have</a>
<a id='line_215'>been a rebuker of them all.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,</a>
<a id='line_218'>thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>5:4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the</a>
<a id='line_221'>spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known</a>
<a id='line_222'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>5:5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall</a>
<a id='line_225'>Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with</a>
<a id='line_226'>them.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>5:6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the</a>
<a id='line_229'>LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from</a>
<a id='line_230'>them.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>5:7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have</a>
<a id='line_233'>begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their</a>
<a id='line_234'>portions.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>5:8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud</a>
<a id='line_237'>at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>5:9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes</a>
<a id='line_240'>of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>5:10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:</a>
<a id='line_243'>therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>5:11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly</a>
<a id='line_246'>walked after the commandment.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>5:12 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of</a>
<a id='line_249'>Judah as rottenness.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>5:13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went</a>
<a id='line_252'>Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal</a>
<a id='line_253'>you, nor cure you of your wound.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>5:14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the</a>
<a id='line_256'>house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away,</a>
<a id='line_257'>and none shall rescue him.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>5:15 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their</a>
<a id='line_260'>offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me</a>
<a id='line_261'>early.</a>
<a id='line_262'></a>
<a id='line_263'>6:1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he</a>
<a id='line_264'>will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>6:2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise</a>
<a id='line_267'>us up, and we shall live in his sight.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>6:3 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going</a>
<a id='line_270'>forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the</a>
<a id='line_271'>rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>6:4 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do</a>
<a id='line_274'>unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early</a>
<a id='line_275'>dew it goeth away.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>6:5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by</a>
<a id='line_278'>the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth</a>
<a id='line_279'>forth.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>6:6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God</a>
<a id='line_282'>more than burnt offerings.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>6:7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they</a>
<a id='line_285'>dealt treacherously against me.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>6:8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with</a>
<a id='line_288'>blood.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>6:9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests</a>
<a id='line_291'>murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>6:10 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is</a>
<a id='line_294'>the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>6:11 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned</a>
<a id='line_297'>the captivity of my people.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>7:1 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was</a>
<a id='line_300'>discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood;</a>
<a id='line_301'>and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>7:2 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their</a>
<a id='line_304'>wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are</a>
<a id='line_305'>before my face.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>7:3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes</a>
<a id='line_308'>with their lies.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>7:4 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who</a>
<a id='line_311'>ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be</a>
<a id='line_312'>leavened.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>7:5 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles</a>
<a id='line_315'>of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>7:6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie</a>
<a id='line_318'>in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth</a>
<a id='line_319'>as a flaming fire.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>7:7 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all</a>
<a id='line_322'>their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>7:8 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake</a>
<a id='line_325'>not turned.</a>

<a id='line_656'>away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the</a>

<a id='line_659'>14:3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither</a>
