<a id='line_1'>      I.</a>

<a id='line_3'>     The Reign Of Diocletian And His Three Associates, Maximian,</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Galerius, And Constantius.—General Reestablishment Of Order And</a>
<a id='line_5'>     Tranquillity.—The Persian War, Victory, And Triumph.—The New Form</a>
<a id='line_6'>     Of Administration.—Abdication And Retirement Of Diocletian And</a>
<a id='line_7'>     Maximian.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      As the reign of Diocletian was more illustrious than that of any</a>
<a id='line_10'>      of his predecessors, so was his birth more abject and obscure.</a>
<a id='line_11'>      The strong claims of merit and of violence had frequently</a>
<a id='line_12'>      superseded the ideal prerogatives of nobility; but a distinct</a>
<a id='line_13'>      line of separation was hitherto preserved between the free and</a>
<a id='line_14'>      the servile part of mankind. The parents of Diocletian had been</a>
<a id='line_15'>      slaves in the house of Anulinus, a Roman senator; nor was he</a>
<a id='line_16'>      himself distinguished by any other name than that which he</a>
<a id='line_17'>      derived from a small town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother</a>
<a id='line_18'>      deduced her origin. 1 It is, however, probable that his father</a>
<a id='line_19'>      obtained the freedom of the family, and that he soon acquired an</a>
<a id='line_20'>      office of scribe, which was commonly exercised by persons of his</a>
<a id='line_21'>      condition. 2 Favorable oracles, or rather the consciousness of</a>
<a id='line_22'>      superior merit, prompted his aspiring son to pursue the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      profession of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be</a>
<a id='line_24'>      extremely curious to observe the gradation of arts and accidents</a>
<a id='line_25'>      which enabled him in the end to fulfil those oracles, and to</a>
<a id='line_26'>      display that merit to the world. Diocletian was successively</a>
<a id='line_27'>      promoted to the government of Mæsia, the honors of the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      consulship, and the important command of the guards of the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      palace. He distinguished his abilities in the Persian war; and</a>
<a id='line_30'>      after the death of Numerian, the slave, by the confession and</a>
<a id='line_31'>      judgment of his rivals, was declared the most worthy of the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      Imperial throne. The malice of religious zeal, whilst it arraigns</a>
<a id='line_33'>      the savage fierceness of his colleague Maximian, has affected to</a>
<a id='line_34'>      cast suspicions on the personal courage of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Diocletian. 3 It would not be easy to persuade us of the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      cowardice of a soldier of fortune, who acquired and preserved the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      esteem of the legions as well as the favor of so many warlike</a>
<a id='line_38'>      princes. Yet even calumny is sagacious enough to discover and to</a>
<a id='line_39'>      attack the most vulnerable part. The valor of Diocletian was</a>
<a id='line_40'>      never found inadequate to his duty, or to the occasion; but he</a>
<a id='line_41'>      appears not to have possessed the daring and generous spirit of a</a>
<a id='line_42'>      hero, who courts danger and fame, disdains artifice, and boldly</a>
<a id='line_43'>      challenges the allegiance of his equals. His abilities were</a>
<a id='line_44'>      useful rather than splendid; a vigorous mind, improved by the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      experience and study of mankind; dexterity and application in</a>
<a id='line_46'>      business; a judicious mixture of liberality and economy, of</a>
<a id='line_47'>      mildness and rigor; profound dissimulation, under the disguise of</a>
<a id='line_48'>      military frankness; steadiness to pursue his ends; flexibility to</a>
<a id='line_49'>      vary his means; and, above all, the great art of submitting his</a>
<a id='line_50'>      own passions, as well as those of others, to the interest of his</a>
<a id='line_51'>      ambition, and of coloring his ambition with the most specious</a>
<a id='line_52'>      pretences of justice and public utility. Like Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_53'>      Diocletian may be considered as the founder of a new empire. Like</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the adopted son of Cæsar, he was distinguished as a statesman</a>
<a id='line_55'>      rather than as a warrior; nor did either of those princes employ</a>
<a id='line_56'>      force, whenever their purpose could be effected by policy.</a>

<a id='line_73'>      tumultu meticulosu et animi disjectus.”]</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>      The victory of Diocletian was remarkable for its singular</a>
<a id='line_76'>      mildness. A people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the</a>
<a id='line_77'>      conqueror, if the usual punishments of death, exile, and</a>
<a id='line_78'>      confiscation, were inflicted with any degree of temper and</a>
<a id='line_79'>      equity, beheld, with the most pleasing astonishment, a civil war,</a>
<a id='line_80'>      the flames of which were extinguished in the field of battle.</a>
<a id='line_81'>      Diocletian received into his confidence Aristobulus, the</a>
<a id='line_82'>      principal minister of the house of Carus, respected the lives,</a>
<a id='line_83'>      the fortunes, and the dignity, of his adversaries, and even</a>
<a id='line_84'>      continued in their respective stations the greater number of the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      servants of Carinus. 4 It is not improbable that motives of</a>
<a id='line_86'>      prudence might assist the humanity of the artful Dalmatian; of</a>
<a id='line_87'>      these servants, many had purchased his favor by secret treachery;</a>
<a id='line_88'>      in others, he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_89'>      master. The discerning judgment of Aurelian, of Probus, and of</a>
<a id='line_90'>      Carus, had filled the several departments of the state and army</a>
<a id='line_91'>      with officers of approved merit, whose removal would have injured</a>
<a id='line_92'>      the public service, without promoting the interest of his</a>
<a id='line_93'>      successor. Such a conduct, however, displayed to the Roman world</a>
<a id='line_94'>      the fairest prospect of the new reign, and the emperor affected</a>
<a id='line_95'>      to confirm this favorable prepossession, by declaring, that,</a>
<a id='line_96'>      among all the virtues of his predecessors, he was the most</a>
<a id='line_97'>      ambitious of imitating the humane philosophy of Marcus Antoninus.</a>
<a id='line_98'>      5</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>      4 (return) [ In this encomium, Aurelius Victor seems to convey a</a>
<a id='line_101'>      just, though indirect, censure of the cruelty of Constantius. It</a>
<a id='line_102'>      appears from the Fasti, that Aristobulus remained præfect of the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      city, and that he ended with Diocletian the consulship which he</a>
<a id='line_104'>      had commenced with Carinus.]</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>      5 (return) [ Aurelius Victor styles Diocletian, “Parentum potius</a>
<a id='line_107'>      quam Dominum.” See Hist. August. p. 30.]</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>      The first considerable action of his reign seemed to evince his</a>
<a id='line_110'>      sincerity as well as his moderation. After the example of Marcus,</a>
<a id='line_111'>      he gave himself a colleague in the person of Maximian, on whom he</a>
<a id='line_112'>      bestowed at first the title of Cæsar, and afterwards that of</a>
<a id='line_113'>      Augustus. 6 But the motives of his conduct, as well as the object</a>
<a id='line_114'>      of his choice, were of a very different nature from those of his</a>
<a id='line_115'>      admired predecessor. By investing a luxurious youth with the</a>
<a id='line_116'>      honors of the purple, Marcus had discharged a debt of private</a>
<a id='line_117'>      gratitude, at the expense, indeed, of the happiness of the state.</a>
<a id='line_118'>      By associating a friend and a fellow-soldier to the labors of</a>
<a id='line_119'>      government, Diocletian, in a time of public danger, provided for</a>
<a id='line_120'>      the defence both of the East and of the West. Maximian was born a</a>
<a id='line_121'>      peasant, and, like Aurelian, in the territory of Sirmium.</a>
<a id='line_122'>      Ignorant of letters, 7 careless of laws, the rusticity of his</a>
<a id='line_123'>      appearance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated</a>
<a id='line_124'>      fortune the meanness of his extraction. War was the only art</a>
<a id='line_125'>      which he professed. In a long course of service he had</a>
<a id='line_126'>      distinguished himself on every frontier of the empire; and though</a>
<a id='line_127'>      his military talents were formed to obey rather than to command,</a>
<a id='line_128'>      though, perhaps, he never attained the skill of a consummate</a>
<a id='line_129'>      general, he was capable, by his valor, constancy, and experience,</a>
<a id='line_130'>      of executing the most arduous undertakings. Nor were the vices of</a>
<a id='line_131'>      Maximian less useful to his benefactor. Insensible to pity, and</a>
<a id='line_132'>      fearless of consequences, he was the ready instrument of every</a>
<a id='line_133'>      act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at</a>
<a id='line_134'>      once suggest and disclaim. As soon as a bloody sacrifice had been</a>
<a id='line_135'>      offered to prudence or to revenge, Diocletian, by his seasonable</a>
<a id='line_136'>      intercession, saved the remaining few whom he had never designed</a>
<a id='line_137'>      to punish, gently censured the severity of his stern colleague,</a>
<a id='line_138'>      and enjoyed the comparison of a golden and an iron age, which was</a>
<a id='line_139'>      universally applied to their opposite maxims of government.</a>
<a id='line_140'>      Notwithstanding the difference of their characters, the two</a>
<a id='line_141'>      emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendship which they</a>
<a id='line_142'>      had contracted in a private station. The haughty, turbulent</a>
<a id='line_143'>      spirit of Maximian, so fatal, afterwards, to himself and to the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      public peace, was accustomed to respect the genius of Diocletian,</a>
<a id='line_145'>      and confessed the ascendant of reason over brutal violence. 8</a>
<a id='line_146'>      From a motive either of pride or superstition, the two emperors</a>
<a id='line_147'>      assumed the titles, the one of Jovius, the other of Herculius.</a>
<a id='line_148'>      Whilst the motion of the world (such was the language of their</a>
<a id='line_149'>      venal orators) was maintained by the all-seeing wisdom of</a>
<a id='line_150'>      Jupiter, the invincible arm of Hercules purged the earth from</a>
<a id='line_151'>      monsters and tyrants. 9</a>

<a id='line_153'>      6 (return) [ The question of the time when Maximian received the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      honors of Cæsar and Augustus has divided modern critics, and</a>

<a id='line_163'>      imitating the conduct of Hannibal and Scipio, had ever heard of</a>
<a id='line_164'>      their names. From thence we may fairly infer, that Maximian was</a>
<a id='line_165'>      more desirous of being considered as a soldier than as a man of</a>
<a id='line_166'>      letters; and it is in this manner that we can often translate the</a>
<a id='line_167'>      language of flattery into that of truth.]</a>

<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>      But even the omnipotence of Jovius and Herculius was insufficient</a>
<a id='line_181'>      to sustain the weight of the public administration. The prudence</a>
<a id='line_182'>      of Diocletian discovered that the empire, assailed on every side</a>
<a id='line_183'>      by the barbarians, required on every side the presence of a great</a>
<a id='line_184'>      army, and of an emperor. With this view, he resolved once more to</a>
<a id='line_185'>      divide his unwieldy power, and with the inferior title of</a>
<a id='line_186'>      _Cæsars_, 901 to confer on two generals of approved merit an</a>
<a id='line_187'>      unequal share of the sovereign authority. 10 Galerius, surnamed</a>
<a id='line_188'>      Armentarius, from his original profession of a herdsman, and</a>
<a id='line_189'>      Constantius, who from his pale complexion had acquired the</a>
<a id='line_190'>      denomination of Chlorus, 11 were the two persons invested with</a>
<a id='line_191'>      the second honors of the Imperial purple. In describing the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      country, extraction, and manners of Herculius, we have already</a>
<a id='line_193'>      delineated those of Galerius, who was often, and not improperly,</a>
<a id='line_194'>      styled the younger Maximian, though, in many instances both of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      virtue and ability, he appears to have possessed a manifest</a>
<a id='line_196'>      superiority over the elder. The birth of Constantius was less</a>
<a id='line_197'>      obscure than that of his colleagues. Eutropius, his father, was</a>
<a id='line_198'>      one of the most considerable nobles of Dardania, and his mother</a>
<a id='line_199'>      was the niece of the emperor Claudius. 12 Although the youth of</a>
<a id='line_200'>      Constantius had been spent in arms, he was endowed with a mild</a>
<a id='line_201'>      and amiable disposition, and the popular voice had long since</a>
<a id='line_202'>      acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last attained. To</a>
<a id='line_203'>      strengthen the bonds of political, by those of domestic, union,</a>
<a id='line_204'>      each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to one of</a>
<a id='line_205'>      the Cæsars, Diocletian to Galerius, and Maximian to Constantius;</a>
<a id='line_206'>      and each, obliging them to repudiate their former wives, bestowed</a>
<a id='line_207'>      his daughter in marriage or his adopted son. 13 These four</a>
<a id='line_208'>      princes distributed among themselves the wide extent of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_209'>      empire. The defence of Gaul, Spain, 14 and Britain, was intrusted</a>
<a id='line_210'>      to Constantius: Galerius was stationed on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      Danube, as the safeguard of the Illyrian provinces. Italy and</a>
<a id='line_212'>      Africa were considered as the department of Maximian; and for his</a>
<a id='line_213'>      peculiar portion, Diocletian reserved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich</a>
<a id='line_214'>      countries of Asia. Every one was sovereign with his own</a>
<a id='line_215'>      jurisdiction; but their united authority extended over the whole</a>
<a id='line_216'>      monarchy, and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues</a>
<a id='line_217'>      with his counsels or presence. The Cæsars, in their exalted rank,</a>
<a id='line_218'>      revered the majesty of the emperors, and the three younger</a>
<a id='line_219'>      princes invariably acknowledged, by their gratitude and</a>
<a id='line_220'>      obedience, the common parent of their fortunes. The suspicious</a>
<a id='line_221'>      jealousy of power found not any place among them; and the</a>
<a id='line_222'>      singular happiness of their union has been compared to a chorus</a>
<a id='line_223'>      of music, whose harmony was regulated and maintained by the</a>

<a id='line_267'>      The first exploit of Maximian, though it is mentioned in a few</a>
<a id='line_268'>      words by our imperfect writers, deserves, from its singularity,</a>
<a id='line_269'>      to be recorded in a history of human manners. He suppressed the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      peasants of Gaul, who, under the appellation of Bagaudæ, 16 had</a>
<a id='line_271'>      risen in a general insurrection; very similar to those which in</a>
<a id='line_272'>      the fourteenth century successively afflicted both France and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      England. 17 It should seem that very many of those institutions,</a>
<a id='line_274'>      referred by an easy solution to the feudal system, are derived</a>
<a id='line_275'>      from the Celtic barbarians. When Cæsar subdued the Gauls, that</a>
<a id='line_276'>      great nation was already divided into three orders of men; the</a>
<a id='line_277'>      clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The first governed</a>
<a id='line_278'>      by superstition, the second by arms, but the third and last was</a>
<a id='line_279'>      not of any weight or account in their public councils. It was</a>
<a id='line_280'>      very natural for the plebeians, oppressed by debt, or</a>
<a id='line_281'>      apprehensive of injuries, to implore the protection of some</a>
<a id='line_282'>      powerful chief, who acquired over their persons and property the</a>
<a id='line_283'>      same absolute right as, among the Greeks and Romans, a master</a>
<a id='line_284'>      exercised over his slaves. 18 The greatest part of the nation was</a>
<a id='line_285'>      gradually reduced into a state of servitude; compelled to</a>
<a id='line_286'>      perpetual labor on the estates of the Gallic nobles, and confined</a>

<a id='line_289'>      series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of</a>
<a id='line_290'>      Gallienus to that of Diocletian, the condition of these servile</a>
<a id='line_291'>      peasants was peculiarly miserable; and they experienced at once</a>

<a id='line_361'>      pilot, and his valor as a soldier. The integrity of the new</a>

<a id='line_453'>      the Rhine was guarded by the presence of Maximian, his brave</a>

<a id='line_460'>      three years which Constantius employed in preparing a fleet</a>
<a id='line_461'>      adequate to the conquest of Britain, he secured the coast of</a>

<a id='line_488'>      enemy. The attack was at length made by the principal squadron,</a>

<a id='line_490'>      of distinguished merit, had been assembled in the north of the</a>

<a id='line_492'>      that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans,</a>
<a id='line_493'>      who ventured to set sail with a side-wind, and on a stormy day.</a>
<a id='line_494'>      The weather proved favorable to their enterprise. Under the cover</a>
<a id='line_495'>      of a thick fog, they escaped the fleet of Allectus, which had</a>
<a id='line_496'>      been stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them, landed in</a>
<a id='line_497'>      safety on some part of the western coast, and convinced the</a>
<a id='line_498'>      Britons, that a superiority of naval strength will not always</a>
<a id='line_499'>      protect their country from a foreign invasion. Asclepiodatus had</a>
<a id='line_500'>      no sooner disembarked the imperial troops, then he set fire to</a>
<a id='line_501'>      his ships; and, as the expedition proved fortunate, his heroic</a>
<a id='line_502'>      conduct was universally admired. The usurper had posted himself</a>
<a id='line_503'>      near London, to expect the formidable attack of Constantius, who</a>
<a id='line_504'>      commanded in person the fleet of Boulogne; but the descent of a</a>
<a id='line_505'>      new enemy required his immediate presence in the West. He</a>
<a id='line_506'>      performed this long march in so precipitate a manner, that he</a>
<a id='line_507'>      encountered the whole force of the præfect with a small body of</a>
<a id='line_508'>      harassed and disheartened troops. The engagement was soon</a>
<a id='line_509'>      terminated by the total defeat and death of Allectus; a single</a>
<a id='line_510'>      battle, as it has often happened, decided the fate of this great</a>

<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>      Britain had none but domestic enemies to dread; and as long as</a>

<a id='line_532'>      The peace of the continent, and the defence of the principal</a>
<a id='line_533'>      rivers which bounded the empire, were objects of far greater</a>
<a id='line_534'>      difficulty and importance. The policy of Diocletian, which</a>
<a id='line_535'>      inspired the councils of his associates, provided for the public</a>
<a id='line_536'>      tranquility, by encouraging a spirit of dissension among the</a>
<a id='line_537'>      barbarians, and by strengthening the fortifications of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_538'>      limit. In the East he fixed a line of camps from Egypt to the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      Persian dominions, and for every camp, he instituted an adequate</a>
<a id='line_540'>      number of stationary troops, commanded by their respective</a>
<a id='line_541'>      officers, and supplied with every kind of arms, from the new</a>
<a id='line_542'>      arsenals which he had formed at Antioch, Emesa, and Damascus. 32</a>
<a id='line_543'>      Nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the</a>
<a id='line_544'>      well-known valor of the barbarians of Europe. From the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_545'>      the Rhine to that of the Danube, the ancient camps, towns, and</a>
<a id='line_546'>      citidels, were diligently reëstablished, and, in the most exposed</a>

<a id='line_548'>      vigilance was introduced among the garrisons of the frontier, and</a>
<a id='line_549'>      every expedient was practised that could render the long chain of</a>
<a id='line_550'>      fortifications firm and impenetrable. 33 A barrier so respectable</a>
<a id='line_551'>      was seldom violated, and the barbarians often turned against each</a>

<a id='line_594'>      never reduced to the necessity of vanquishing an army of</a>

<a id='line_657'>      While the Cæsars exercised their valor on the banks of the Rhine</a>

<a id='line_659'>      southern confines of the Roman world. From the Nile to Mount</a>
<a id='line_660'>      Atlas, Africa was in arms. A confederacy of five Moorish nations</a>
<a id='line_661'>      issued from their deserts to invade the peaceful provinces. 40</a>
<a id='line_662'>      Julian had assumed the purple at Carthage. 41 Achilleus at</a>
<a id='line_663'>      Alexandria, and even the Blemmyes, renewed, or rather continued,</a>
<a id='line_664'>      their incursions into the Upper Egypt. Scarcely any circumstances</a>
<a id='line_665'>      have been preserved of the exploits of Maximian in the western</a>
<a id='line_666'>      parts of Africa; but it appears, by the event, that the progress</a>
<a id='line_667'>      of his arms was rapid and decisive, that he vanquished the</a>
<a id='line_668'>      fiercest barbarians of Mauritania, and that he removed them from</a>
<a id='line_669'>      the mountains, whose inaccessible strength had inspired their</a>
<a id='line_670'>      inhabitants with a lawless confidence, and habituated them to a</a>
<a id='line_671'>      life of rapine and violence. 42 Diocletian, on his side, opened</a>
<a id='line_672'>      the campaign in Egypt by the siege of Alexandria, cut off the</a>
<a id='line_673'>      aqueducts which conveyed the waters of the Nile into every</a>
<a id='line_674'>      quarter of that immense city, 43 and rendering his camp</a>
<a id='line_675'>      impregnable to the sallies of the besieged multitude, he pushed</a>
<a id='line_676'>      his reiterated attacks with caution and vigor. After a siege of</a>
<a id='line_677'>      eight months, Alexandria, wasted by the sword and by fire,</a>
<a id='line_678'>      implored the clemency of the conqueror, but it experienced the</a>
<a id='line_679'>      full extent of his severity. Many thousands of the citizens</a>
<a id='line_680'>      perished in a promiscuous slaughter, and there were few obnoxious</a>
<a id='line_681'>      persons in Egypt who escaped a sentence either of death or at</a>
<a id='line_682'>      least of exile. 44 The fate of Busiris and of Coptos was still</a>
<a id='line_683'>      more melancholy than that of Alexandria: those proud cities, the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      former distinguished by its antiquity, the latter enriched by the</a>
<a id='line_685'>      passage of the Indian trade, were utterly destroyed by the arms</a>
<a id='line_686'>      and by the severe order of Diocletian. 45 The character of the</a>
<a id='line_687'>      Egyptian nation, insensible to kindness, but extremely</a>
<a id='line_688'>      susceptible of fear, could alone justify this excessive rigor.</a>
<a id='line_689'>      The seditions of Alexandria had often affected the tranquillity</a>
<a id='line_690'>      and subsistence of Rome itself. Since the usurpation of Firmus,</a>
<a id='line_691'>      the province of Upper Egypt, incessantly relapsing into</a>
<a id='line_692'>      rebellion, had embraced the alliance of the savages of Æthiopia.</a>
<a id='line_693'>      The number of the Blemmyes, scattered between the Island of Meroe</a>
<a id='line_694'>      and the Red Sea, was very inconsiderable, their disposition was</a>
<a id='line_695'>      unwarlike, their weapons rude and inoffensive. 46 Yet in the</a>
<a id='line_696'>      public disorders, these barbarians, whom antiquity, shocked with</a>
<a id='line_697'>      the deformity of their figure, had almost excluded from the human</a>
<a id='line_698'>      species, presumed to rank themselves among the enemies of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_699'>      47 Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians; and while</a>

<a id='line_701'>      their vexations inroads might again harass the repose of the</a>
<a id='line_702'>      province. With a view of opposing to the Blemmyes a suitable</a>
<a id='line_703'>      adversary, Diocletian persuaded the Nobatæ, or people of Nubia,</a>
<a id='line_704'>      to remove from their ancient habitations in the deserts of Libya,</a>
<a id='line_705'>      and resigned to them an extensive but unprofitable territory</a>

<a id='line_754'>      At the same time that Diocletian chastised the past crimes of the</a>

<a id='line_756'>      many wise regulations, which were confirmed and enforced under</a>
<a id='line_757'>      the succeeding reigns. 49 One very remarkable edict which he</a>
<a id='line_758'>      published, instead of being condemned as the effect of jealous</a>
<a id='line_759'>      tyranny, deserves to be applauded as an act of prudence and</a>
<a id='line_760'>      humanity. He caused a diligent inquiry to be made “for all the</a>
<a id='line_761'>      ancient books which treated of the admirable art of making gold</a>
<a id='line_762'>      and silver, and without pity, committed them to the flames;</a>
<a id='line_763'>      apprehensive, as we are assumed, lest the opulence of the</a>
<a id='line_764'>      Egyptians should inspire them with confidence to rebel against</a>
<a id='line_765'>      the empire.” 50 But if Diocletian had been convinced of the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      reality of that valuable art, far from extinguishing the memory,</a>
<a id='line_767'>      he would have converted the operation of it to the benefit of the</a>
<a id='line_768'>      public revenue. It is much more likely, that his good sense</a>
<a id='line_769'>      discovered to him the folly of such magnificent pretensions, and</a>
<a id='line_770'>      that he was desirous of preserving the reason and fortunes of his</a>
<a id='line_771'>      subjects from the mischievous pursuit. It may be remarked, that</a>

<a id='line_868'>      exasperated by so many injuries, should arm with zeal in the</a>
<a id='line_869'>      cause of their independence, their religion, and their hereditary</a>
<a id='line_870'>      sovereign. The torrent bore down every obstacle, and the Persian</a>
<a id='line_871'>      garrisons retreated before its fury. The nobles of Armenia flew</a>
<a id='line_872'>      to the standard of Tiridates, all alleging their past merit,</a>
<a id='line_873'>      offering their future service, and soliciting from the new king</a>
<a id='line_874'>      those honors and rewards from which they had been excluded with</a>
<a id='line_875'>      disdain under the foreign government. 56 The command of the army</a>
<a id='line_876'>      was bestowed on Artavasdes, whose father had saved the infancy of</a>
<a id='line_877'>      Tiridates, and whose family had been massacred for that generous</a>
<a id='line_878'>      action. The brother of Artavasdes obtained the government of a</a>
<a id='line_879'>      province. One of the first military dignities was conferred on</a>
<a id='line_880'>      the satrap Otas, a man of singular temperance and fortitude, who</a>
<a id='line_881'>      presented to the king his sister 57 and a considerable treasure,</a>
<a id='line_882'>      both of which, in a sequestered fortress, Otas had preserved from</a>
<a id='line_883'>      violation. Among the Armenian nobles appeared an ally, whose</a>
<a id='line_884'>      fortunes are too remarkable to pass unnoticed. His name was</a>
<a id='line_885'>      Mamgo, 571 his origin was Scythian, and the horde which</a>
<a id='line_886'>      acknowledge his authority had encamped a very few years before on</a>
<a id='line_887'>      the skirts of the Chinese empire, 58 which at that time extended</a>
<a id='line_888'>      as far as the neighborhood of Sogdiana. 59 Having incurred the</a>
<a id='line_889'>      displeasure of his master, Mamgo, with his followers, retired to</a>
<a id='line_890'>      the banks of the Oxus, and implored the protection of Sapor. The</a>
<a id='line_891'>      emperor of China claimed the fugitive, and alleged the rights of</a>
<a id='line_892'>      sovereignty. The Persian monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality,</a>
<a id='line_893'>      and with some difficulty avoided a war, by the promise that he</a>

<a id='line_1026'>      purpose, was removed from the banks of the Danube to those of the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      Euphrates. The armies soon encountered each other in the plains</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      of Mesopotamia, and two battles were fought with various and</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      doubtful success; but the third engagement was of a more decisive</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      nature; and the Roman army received a total overthrow, which is</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      attributed to the rashness of Galerius, who, with an</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      inconsiderable body of troops, attacked the innumerable host of</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      the Persians. 64 But the consideration of the country that was</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      the scene of action, may suggest another reason for his defeat.</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      The same ground on which Galerius was vanquished, had been</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      rendered memorable by the death of Crassus, and the slaughter of</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      ten legions. It was a plain of more than sixty miles, which</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      extended from the hills of Carrhæ to the Euphrates; a smooth and</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      barren surface of sandy desert, without a hillock, without a</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      tree, and without a spring of fresh water. 65 The steady infantry</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      of the Romans, fainting with heat and thirst, could neither hope</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      for victory if they preserved their ranks, nor break their ranks</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger. In this</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      situation they were gradually encompassed by the superior</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      numbers, harassed by the rapid evolutions, and destroyed by the</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      arrows of the barbarian cavalry.</a>
<a id='line_1047'></a>
<a id='line_1048'>      The king of Armenia had signalized his valor in the battle, and</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      acquired personal glory by the public misfortune. He was pursued</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      as far as the Euphrates; his horse was wounded, and it appeared</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy. In this</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      extremity Tiridates embraced the only refuge which appeared</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      before him: he dismounted and plunged into the stream. His armor</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      was heavy, the river very deep, and at those parts at least half</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      a mile in breadth; 66 yet such was his strength and dexterity,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      that he reached in safety the opposite bank. 67 With regard to</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      the Roman general, we are ignorant of the circumstances of his</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      escape; but when he returned to Antioch, Diocletian received him,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      not with the tenderness of a friend and colleague, but with the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      indignation of an offended sovereign. The haughtiest of men,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      clothed in his purple, but humbled by the sense of his fault and</a>

<a id='line_1099'>      head of a chosen army of twenty-five thousand men, Galerius again</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      passed the Euphrates; but, instead of exposing his legions in the</a>

<a id='line_1105'>      confirmed the Roman discipline, while the barbarians, elated by</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      success, were become so negligent and remiss, that in the moment</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      when they least expected it, they were surprised by the active</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      conduct of Galerius, who, attended only by two horsemen, had with</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      his own eyes secretly examined the state and position of their</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      camp. A surprise, especially in the night time, was for the most</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      part fatal to a Persian army. “Their horses were tied, and</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      generally shackled, to prevent their running away; and if an</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      alarm happened, a Persian had his housing to fix, his horse to</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      bridle, and his corselet to put on, before he could mount.” 71 On</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      this occasion, the impetuous attack of Galerius spread disorder</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      and dismay over the camp of the barbarians. A slight resistance</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      was followed by a dreadful carnage, and, in the general</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      confusion, the wounded monarch (for Narses commanded his armies</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      in person) fled towards the deserts of Media. His sumptuous</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      tents, and those of his satraps, afforded an immense booty to the</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      conqueror; and an incident is mentioned, which proves the rustic</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      but martial ignorance of the legions in the elegant superfluities</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      of life. A bag of shining leather, filled with pearls, fell into</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      the hands of a private soldier; he carefully preserved the bag,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      but he threw away its contents, judging that whatever was of no</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      use could not possibly be of any value. 72 The principal loss of</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      Narses was of a much more affecting nature. Several of his wives,</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      his sisters, and children, who had attended the army, were made</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      captives in the defeat. But though the character of Galerius had</a>

<a id='line_1162'>      While the East anxiously expected the decision of this great</a>

<a id='line_1167'>      condescended to advance towards the frontier, with a view of</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      moderating, by his presence and counsels, the pride of Galerius.</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      The interview of the Roman princes at Nisibis was accompanied</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      with every expression of respect on one side, and of esteem on</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      the other. It was in that city that they soon afterwards gave</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      audience to the ambassador of the Great King. 74 The power, or at</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      least the spirit, of Narses, had been broken by his last defeat;</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      and he considered an immediate peace as the only means that could</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      stop the progress of the Roman arms. He despatched Apharban, a</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      servant who possessed his favor and confidence, with a commission</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      to negotiate a treaty, or rather to receive whatever conditions</a>

<a id='line_1179'>      expressing his master’s gratitude for the generous treatment of</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      his family, and by soliciting the liberty of those illustrious</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      captives. He celebrated the valor of Galerius, without degrading</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      the reputation of Narses, and thought it no dishonor to confess</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      the superiority of the victorious Cæsar, over a monarch who had</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      surpassed in glory all the princes of his race. Notwithstanding</a>

<a id='line_1190'>      observing that the Roman and Persian monarchies were the two eyes</a>

<a id='line_1200'></a>
<a id='line_1201'>      “It well becomes the Persians,” replied Galerius, with a</a>

<a id='line_1204'>      fortune, and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of</a>

<a id='line_1207'>      with indignity. They detained him till the last moment of his</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      life in shameful captivity, and after his death they exposed his</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      body to perpetual ignominy.” Softening, however, his tone,</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      Galerius insinuated to the ambassador, that it had never been the</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      practice of the Romans to trample on a prostrate enemy; and that,</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      on this occasion, they should consult their own dignity rather</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      than the Persian merit. He dismissed Apharban with a hope that</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      Narses would soon be informed on what conditions he might obtain,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      from the clemency of the emperors, a lasting peace, and the</a>

<a id='line_1219'>      ambition of the former grasped at the conquest of the East, and</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      had proposed to reduce Persia into the state of a province. The</a>

<a id='line_1222'>      Augustus and the Antonines, embraced the favorable opportunity of</a>

<a id='line_1230'>      In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      appointed Sicorius Probus, one of their secretaries, to acquaint</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      the Persian court with their final resolution. As the minister of</a>

<a id='line_1234'>      friendship; but, under the pretence of allowing him the necessary</a>

<a id='line_1237'>      king, till at length he was admitted to his presence, near the</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      River Asprudus in Media. The secret motive of Narses, in this</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      delay, had been to collect such a military force as might enable</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      him, though sincerely desirous of peace, to negotiate with the</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      greater weight and dignity. Three persons only assisted at this</a>

<a id='line_1243'>      guards, and an officer who had commanded on the Armenian</a>

<a id='line_1250'>      revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but as Nisibis was</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      situated within their own dominions, and as they were masters</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      both of the imports and exports, it should seem that such</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      restraints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      foreign treaty. To render them more effectual, some stipulations</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      were probably required on the side of the king of Persia, which</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      dignity, that Narses could not be persuaded to subscribe them. As</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      this was the only article to which he refused his consent, it was</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      no longer insisted on; and the emperors either suffered the trade</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      to flow in its natural channels, or contented themselves with</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      such restrictions, as it depended on their own authority to</a>

<a id='line_1278'>      boundary between the two monarchies. 77 That river, which rose</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      near the Tigris, was increased, a few miles below Nisibis, by the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      little stream of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      Singara, and fell into the Euphrates at Circesium, a frontier</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      town, which, by the care of Diocletian, was very strongly</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      fortified. 78 Mesopotomia, the object of so many wars, was ceded</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      to the empire; and the Persians, by this treaty, renounced all</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      pretensions to that great province. II. They relinquished to the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      Romans five provinces beyond the Tigris. 79 Their situation</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      formed a very useful barrier, and their natural strength was soon</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      improved by art and military skill. Four of these, to the north</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      of the river, were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      extent; Intiline, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Moxoene; 791 but on</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      the east of the Tigris, the empire acquired the large and</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      the heart of the despotic monarchies of Asia. The ten thousand</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      Greeks traversed their country, after a painful march, or rather</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      engagement, of seven days; and it is confessed by their leader,</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      in his incomparable relation of the retreat, that they suffered</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      more from the arrows of the Carduchians, than from the power of</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      the Great King. 80 Their posterity, the Curds, with very little</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      alteration either of name or manners, 801 acknowledged the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      nominal sovereignty of the Turkish sultan. III. It is almost</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      needless to observe, that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      was restored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      the Imperial supremacy were fully asserted and secured. The</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      limits of Armenia were extended as far as the fortress of Sintha</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      in Media, and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      liberality as of justice. Of the provinces already mentioned</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      beyond the Tigris, the four first had been dismembered by the</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      Parthians from the crown of Armenia; 81 and when the Romans</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      acquired the possession of them, they stipulated, at the expense</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      of the usurpers, an ample compensation, which invested their ally</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      with the extensive and fertile country of Atropatene. Its</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      principal city, in the same situation perhaps as the modern</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      Tauris, was frequently honored by the residence of Tiridates; and</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in the</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      buildings and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes.</a>

<a id='line_1318'>      savage. But they were accustomed to the use of arms, and they</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      formidable than themselves. The narrow defiles of Mount Caucasus</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      were in their hands, and it was in their choice, either to admit</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia, whenever a</a>

<a id='line_1324'>      of the South. 83 The nomination of the kings of Iberia, which was</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      resigned by the Persian monarch to the emperors, contributed to</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      the strength and security of the Roman power in Asia. 84 The East</a>

<a id='line_1448'>      Capitol. 88 The native Romans felt and confessed the power of</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      this agreeable illusion. It was derived from their ancestors, had</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      grown up with their earliest habits of life, and was protected,</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      in some measure, by the opinion of political utility. The form</a>

<a id='line_1461'>      extraction, respected their adopted country, as the seat of their</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      power, and the centre of their extensive dominions. The</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      emergencies of war very frequently required their presence on the</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      frontiers; but Diocletian and Maximian were the first Roman</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary residence in</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      the provinces; and their conduct, however it might be suggested</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      by private motives, was justified by very specious considerations</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      of policy. The court of the emperor of the West was, for the most</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      part, established at Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      Alps, appeared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      Germany. Milan soon assumed the splendor of an Imperial city. The</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      houses are described as numerous and well built; the manners of</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      the people as polished and liberal. A circus, a theatre, a mint,</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      a palace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian;</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      porticos adorned with statues, and a double circumference of</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      walls, contributed to the beauty of the new capital; nor did it</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      seem oppressed even by the proximity of Rome. 90 To rival the</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      majesty of Rome was the ambition likewise of Diocletian, who</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      employed his leisure, and the wealth of the East, in the</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      embellishment of Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of Europe</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      and Asia, almost at an equal distance between the Danube and the</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      Euphrates. By the taste of the monarch, and at the expense of the</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      people, Nicomedia acquired, in the space of a few years, a degree</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      of magnificence which might appear to have required the labor of</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      ages, and became inferior only to Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch,</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      in extent of populousness. 91 The life of Diocletian and Maximian</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      was a life of action, and a considerable portion of it was spent</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      in camps, or in the long and frequent marches; but whenever the</a>

<a id='line_1532'>      freedom was not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      of the most artful policy. That crafty prince had framed a new</a>

<a id='line_1535'>      the family of Constantine; and as the image of the old</a>

<a id='line_1539'>      elevation of Diocletian, the transient greatness, and the</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      ambitious hopes, of the Roman senate. As long as that enthusiasm</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      prevailed, many of the nobles imprudently displayed their zeal in</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      the cause of freedom; and after the successes of Probus had</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      withdrawn their countenance from the republican party, the</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment.</a>

<a id='line_1547'>      of extinguishing this troublesome, rather than dangerous spirit,</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper. The most</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      illustrious members of the senate, whom Diocletian always</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      affected to esteem, were involved, by his colleague, in the</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      accusation of imaginary plots; and the possession of an elegant</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      villa, or a well-cultivated estate, was interpreted as a</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      convincing evidence of guilt. 93 The camp of the Prætorians,</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      which had so long oppressed, began to protect, the majesty of</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      Rome; and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      of their power, they were naturally disposed to unite their</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      strength with the authority of the senate. By the prudent</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      measures of Diocletian, the numbers of the Prætorians were</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      insensibly reduced, their privileges abolished, 94 and their</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      place supplied by two faithful legions of Illyricum, who, under</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      the new titles of Jovians and Herculians, were appointed to</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      perform the service of the Imperial guards. 95 But the most fatal</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      though secret wound, which the senate received from the hands of</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      Diocletian and Maximian, was inflicted by the inevitable</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      operation of their absence. As long as the emperors resided at</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      Rome, that assembly might be oppressed, but it could scarcely be</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      neglected. The successors of Augustus exercised the power of</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      dictating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might suggest;</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate. The</a>

<a id='line_1616'>      When the Roman princes had lost sight of the senate and of their</a>

<a id='line_1619'>      censor, and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed,</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      betrayed to the people its republican extraction. Those modest</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      titles were laid aside; 97 and if they still distinguished their</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      high station by the appellation of Emperor, or Imperator, that</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      word was understood in a new and more dignified sense, and no</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      longer denoted the general of the Roman armies, but the sovereign</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      of the Roman world. The name of Emperor, which was at first of a</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      military nature, was associated with another of a more servile</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      kind. The epithet of Dominus, or Lord, in its primitive</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      signification, was expressive not of the authority of a prince</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      over his subjects, or of a commander over his soldiers, but of</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves. 98</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      abhorrence by the first Cæsars. Their resistance insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      became more feeble, and the name less odious; till at length the</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      style of _our Lord and Emperor_ was not only bestowed by</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      flattery, but was regularly admitted into the laws and public</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      monuments. Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      satisfy the most excessive vanity; and if the successors of</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      Diocletian still declined the title of King, it seems to have</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      delicacy. Wherever the Latin tongue was in use, (and it was the</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      language of government throughout the empire,) the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      title, as it was peculiar to themselves, conveyed a more</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      respectable idea than the name of king, which they must have</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      shared with a hundred barbarian chieftains; or which, at the</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      best, they could derive only from Romulus, or from Tarquin. But</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      the sentiments of the East were very different from those of the</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      West. From the earliest period of history, the sovereigns of Asia</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      had been celebrated in the Greek language by the title of</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      Basileus, or King; and since it was considered as the first</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      distinction among men, it was soon employed by the servile</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      provincials of the East, in their humble addresses to the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      throne. 99 Even the attributes, or at least the titles, of the</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      DIVINITY, were usurped by Diocletian and Maximian, who</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      transmitted them to a succession of Christian emperors. 100 Such</a>

<a id='line_1712'>      usually paid to senators and magistrates. Their principal</a>

<a id='line_1718'>      Persia. 101 He ventured to assume the diadem, an ornament</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      detested by the Romans as the odious ensign of royalty, and the</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      use of which had been considered as the most desperate act of the</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      madness of Caligula. It was no more than a broad white fillet set</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      with pearls, which encircled the emperor’s head. The sumptuous</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      robes of Diocletian and his successors were of silk and gold; and</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      it is remarked with indignation that even their shoes were</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      studded with the most precious gems. The access to their sacred</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      person was every day rendered more difficult by the institution</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      of new forms and ceremonies. The avenues of the palace were</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      strictly guarded by the various schools, as they began to be</a>

<a id='line_1731'>      of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      the progress of despotism. When a subject was at length admitted</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      to the Imperial presence, he was obliged, whatever might be his</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      rank, to fall prostrate on the ground, and to adore, according to</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      the eastern fashion, the divinity of his lord and master. 102</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      Diocletian was a man of sense, who, in the course of private as</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      well as public life, had formed a just estimate both of himself</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      and of mankind; nor is it easy to conceive that in substituting</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      the manners of Persia to those of Rome he was seriously actuated</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      by so mean a principle as that of vanity. He flattered himself</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      that an ostentation of splendor and luxury would subdue the</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      imagination of the multitude; that the monarch would be less</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      exposed to the rude license of the people and the soldiers, as</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      his person was secluded from the public view; and that habits of</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      submission would insensibly be productive of sentiments of</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      veneration. Like the modesty affected by Augustus, the state</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      maintained by Diocletian was a theatrical representation; but it</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      must be confessed, that of the two comedies, the former was of a</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      much more liberal and manly character than the latter. It was the</a>

<a id='line_1760'>      Ostentation was the first principle of the new system instituted</a>

<a id='line_1770'>      season of its full maturity and perfection. 103 Reserving,</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      therefore, for the reign of Constantine a more exact picture of</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      the new empire, we shall content ourselves with describing the</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      principal and decisive outline, as it was traced by the hand of</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      Diocletian. He had associated three colleagues in the exercise of</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      the supreme power; and as he was convinced that the abilities of</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      a single man were inadequate to the public defence, he considered</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      the joint administration of four princes not as a temporary</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      expedient, but as a fundamental law of the constitution. It was</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      his intention that the two elder princes should be distinguished</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      by the use of the diadem, and the title of _Augusti;_ that, as</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      affection or esteem might direct their choice, they should</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      regularly call to their assistance two subordinate colleagues;</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      and that the _Cæsars_, rising in their turn to the first rank,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors. The empire</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      was divided into four parts. The East and Italy were the most</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      honorable, the Danube and the Rhine the most laborious stations.</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      The former claimed the presence of the _Augusti_, the latter were</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      intrusted to the administration of the _Cæsars_. The strength of</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      the legions was in the hands of the four partners of sovereignty,</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      and the despair of successively vanquishing four formidable</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general. In</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      their civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, inscribed with</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      their joint names, were received in all the provinces, as</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      promulgated by their mutual councils and authority.</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      Notwithstanding these precautions, the political union of the</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      Roman world was gradually dissolved, and a principle of division</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      was introduced, which, in the course of a few years, occasioned</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      the perpetual separation of the Eastern and Western Empires.</a>

<a id='line_1806'></a>
<a id='line_1807'>      The system of Diocletian was accompanied with another very</a>

<a id='line_1809'>      overlooked; a more expensive establishment, and consequently an</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      increase of taxes, and the oppression of the people. Instead of a</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      modest family of slaves and freedmen, such as had contented the</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      simple greatness of Augustus and Trajan, three or four</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      empire, and as many Roman _kings_ contended with each other and</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      with the Persian monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      luxury. The number of ministers, of magistrates, of officers, and</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      of servants, who filled the different departments of the state,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      borrow the warm expression of a contemporary) “when the</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      proportion of those who received exceeded the proportion of those</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      who contributed, the provinces were oppressed by the weight of</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      tributes.” 104 From this period to the extinction of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamors and</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      complaints. According to his religion and situation, each writer</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      chooses either Diocletian, or Constantine, or Valens, or</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      Theodosius, for the object of his invectives; but they</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      unanimously agree in representing the burden of the public</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      impositions, and particularly the land tax and capitation, as the</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times. From</a>

<a id='line_1833'>      and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      than to the uniform system of their administration. 1041 The</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      emperor Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      during his reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds</a>

<a id='line_1856'>      Galerius. It fixed a maximum of prices throughout the empire, for</a>

<a id='line_1858'>      insists, with great vehemence on the extortion and inhumanity of</a>

<a id='line_1901'>      very striking resemblance between the characters of the two</a>

<a id='line_2017'>      which afford so many resources in solitude, were incapable of</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      fixing the attention of Diocletian; but he had preserved, or at</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      least he soon recovered, a taste for the most innocent as well as</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      natural pleasures, and his leisure hours were sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      employed in building, planting, and gardening. His answer to</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      Maximian is deservedly celebrated. He was solicited by that</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      restless old man to reassume the reins of government, and the</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      Imperial purple. He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      calmly observing, that if he could show Maximian the cabbages</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      which he had planted with his own hands at Salona, he should no</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      pursuit of power. 112 In his conversations with his friends, he</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      frequently acknowledged, that of all arts, the most difficult was</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      the art of reigning; and he expressed himself on that favorite</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      experience. “How often,” was he accustomed to say, “is it the</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      interest of four or five ministers to combine together to deceive</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      their sovereign! Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity,</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      the truth is concealed from his knowledge; he can see only with</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      their eyes, he hears nothing but their misrepresentations. He</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness, and</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his subjects. By</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      such infamous arts,” added Diocletian, “the best and wisest</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers.” 113</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      A just estimate of greatness, and the assurance of immortal fame,</a>

<a id='line_2047'>      impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences.</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      Fear, sorrow, and discontent, sometimes pursued him into the</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      solitude of Salona. His tenderness, or at least his pride, was</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      the last moments of Diocletian were imbittered by some affronts,</a>

<a id='line_2079'>      his retirement. Salona, a principal city of his native province</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      of Dalmatia, was near two hundred Roman miles (according to the</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      measurement of the public highways) from Aquileia and the</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      confines of Italy, and about two hundred and seventy from</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      Sirmium, the usual residence of the emperors whenever they</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      visited the Illyrian frontier. 115 A miserable village still</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      preserves the name of Salona; but so late as the sixteenth</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      century, the remains of a theatre, and a confused prospect of</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      broken arches and marble columns, continued to attest its ancient</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      splendor. 116 About six or seven miles from the city Diocletian</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      constructed a magnificent palace, and we may infer, from the</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      greatness of the work, how long he had meditated his design of</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      abdicating the empire. The choice of a spot which united all that</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      the partiality of a native. “The soil was dry and fertile, the</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      air is pure and wholesome, and, though extremely hot during the</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      summer months, this country seldom feels those sultry and noxious</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      winds to which the coasts of Istria and some parts of Italy are</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      exposed. The views from the palace are no less beautiful than the</a>

<a id='line_2133'>      highest admiration. 119 It covered an extent of ground consisting</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      of between nine and ten English acres. The form was quadrangular,</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      flanked with sixteen towers. Two of the sides were near six</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      hundred, and the other two near seven hundred feet in length. The</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      whole was constructed of a beautiful freestone, extracted from</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      the neighboring quarries of Trau, or Tragutium, and very little</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      inferior to marble itself. Four streets, intersecting each other</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      at right angles, divided the several parts of this great edifice,</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden Gate. The</a>
