<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      The unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the</a>
<a id='line_7'>      greatness, and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of</a>
<a id='line_8'>      Constantine. After a tranquil and prosperous reign, the conquerer</a>
<a id='line_9'>      bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire; a</a>
<a id='line_10'>      new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the</a>
<a id='line_11'>      innovations which he established have been embraced and</a>
<a id='line_12'>      consecrated by succeeding generations. The age of the great</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Constantine and his sons is filled with important events; but the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      historian must be oppressed by their number and variety, unless</a>
<a id='line_15'>      he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are</a>
<a id='line_16'>      connected only by the order of time. He will describe the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      political institutions that gave strength and stability to the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      empire, before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions</a>
<a id='line_19'>      which hastened its decline. He will adopt the division unknown to</a>
<a id='line_20'>      the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs: the victory of</a>
<a id='line_21'>      the Christians, and their intestine discord, will supply copious</a>
<a id='line_22'>      and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>      After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, his victorious rival</a>
<a id='line_25'>      proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in</a>
<a id='line_26'>      future times, the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire</a>
<a id='line_27'>      and religion of Constantine. The motives, whether of pride or of</a>
<a id='line_28'>      policy, which first induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the ancient seat of government, had acquired additional weight by</a>
<a id='line_30'>      the example of his successors, and the habits of forty years.</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which</a>
<a id='line_32'>      had once acknowledged her supremacy; and the country of the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      C¾sars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince,</a>
<a id='line_34'>      born in the neighborhood of the Danube, educated in the courts</a>
<a id='line_35'>      and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions</a>
<a id='line_36'>      of Britain. The Italians, who had received Constantine as their</a>
<a id='line_37'>      deliverer, submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes</a>
<a id='line_38'>      condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but</a>
<a id='line_39'>      they were seldom honored with the presence of their new</a>
<a id='line_40'>      sovereign. During the vigor of his age, Constantine, according to</a>
<a id='line_41'>      the various exigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity,</a>
<a id='line_42'>      or with active diligence, along the frontiers of his extensive</a>
<a id='line_43'>      dominions; and was always prepared to take the field either</a>
<a id='line_44'>      against a foreign or a domestic enemy. But as he gradually</a>
<a id='line_45'>      reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life, he</a>
<a id='line_46'>      began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent</a>
<a id='line_47'>      station the strength as well as majesty of the throne. In the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      choice of an advantageous situation, he preferred the confines of</a>
<a id='line_49'>      Europe and Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who</a>
<a id='line_50'>      dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch, who indignantly</a>
<a id='line_52'>      supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With these views,</a>
<a id='line_53'>      Diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by</a>
<a id='line_55'>      the protector of the church: and Constantine was not insensible</a>
<a id='line_56'>      to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      glory of his own name. During the late operations of the war</a>
<a id='line_58'>      against Licinius, he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate,</a>
<a id='line_59'>      both as a soldier and as a statesman, the incomparable position</a>
<a id='line_60'>      of Byzantium; and to observe how strongly it was guarded by</a>
<a id='line_61'>      nature against a hostile attack, whilst it was accessible on</a>
<a id='line_62'>      every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse. Many ages</a>
<a id='line_63'>      before Constantine, one of the most judicious historians of</a>
<a id='line_64'>      antiquity1 had described the advantages of a situation, from</a>
<a id='line_65'>      whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_66'>      and the honors of a flourishing and independent republic. 2</a>

<a id='line_70'>      the extent of their territory contracted, by the inroads of the</a>
<a id='line_71'>      wild Thracians.]</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>      2 (return) [ The navigator Byzas, who was styled the son of</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Neptune, founded the city 656 years before the Christian ¾ra. His</a>
<a id='line_75'>      followers were drawn from Argos and Megara. Byzantium was</a>
<a id='line_76'>      afterwards rebuild and fortified by the Spartan general</a>
<a id='line_77'>      Pausanias. See Scaliger Animadvers. ad Euseb. p. 81. Ducange,</a>
<a id='line_78'>      Constantinopolis, l. i part i. cap 15, 16. With regard to the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      wars of the Byzantines against Philip, the Gauls, and the kings</a>
<a id='line_80'>      of Bithynia, we should trust none but the ancient writers who</a>
<a id='line_81'>      lived before the greatness of the Imperial city had excited a</a>
<a id='line_82'>      spirit of flattery and fiction.]</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>      If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it acquired with the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      august name of Constantinople, the figure of the Imperial city</a>
<a id='line_86'>      may be represented under that of an unequal triangle. The obtuse</a>
<a id='line_87'>      point, which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia,</a>
<a id='line_88'>      meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus. The</a>
<a id='line_89'>      northern side of the city is bounded by the harbor; and the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      southern is washed by the Propontis, or Sea of Marmara. The basis</a>
<a id='line_91'>      of the triangle is opposed to the west, and terminates the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      continent of Europe. But the admirable form and division of the</a>
<a id='line_93'>      circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample</a>
<a id='line_94'>      explanation, be clearly or sufficiently understood. The winding</a>
<a id='line_95'>      channel through which the waters of the Euxine flow with a rapid</a>
<a id='line_96'>      and incessant course towards the Mediterranean, received the</a>
<a id='line_97'>      appellation of Bosphorus, a name not less celebrated in the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      history, than in the fables, of antiquity. 3 A crowd of temples</a>
<a id='line_99'>      and of votive altars, profusely scattered along its steep and</a>
<a id='line_100'>      woody banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      devotion of the Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the</a>
<a id='line_102'>      Argonauts, explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine. On</a>
<a id='line_103'>      these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      Phineus, infested by the obscene harpies; 4 and of the sylvan</a>
<a id='line_105'>      reign of Amycus, who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the</a>
<a id='line_106'>      cestus. 5 The straits of the Bosphorus are terminated by the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Cyanean rocks, which, according to the description of the poets,</a>
<a id='line_108'>      had once floated on the face of the waters; and were destined by</a>
<a id='line_109'>      the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of</a>
<a id='line_110'>      profane curiosity. 6 From the Cyanean rocks to the point and</a>
<a id='line_111'>      harbor of Byzantium, the winding length of the Bosphorus extends</a>
<a id='line_112'>      about sixteen miles, 7 and its most ordinary breadth may be</a>
<a id='line_113'>      computed at about one mile and a half. The new castles of Europe</a>
<a id='line_114'>      and Asia are constructed, on either continent, upon the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of Jupiter</a>
<a id='line_116'>      Urius. The _old_ castles, a work of the Greek emperors, command</a>
<a id='line_117'>      the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite</a>
<a id='line_118'>      banks advance within five hundred paces of each other. These</a>
<a id='line_119'>      fortresses were destroyed and strengthened by Mahomet the Second,</a>
<a id='line_120'>      when he meditated the siege of Constantinople: 8 but the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_121'>      conqueror was most probably ignorant, that near two thousand</a>
<a id='line_122'>      years before his reign, Darius had chosen the same situation to</a>
<a id='line_123'>      connect the two continents by a bridge of boats. 9 At a small</a>
<a id='line_124'>      distance from the old castles we discover the little town of</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Chrysopolis, or Scutari, which may almost be considered as the</a>
<a id='line_126'>      Asiatic suburb of Constantinople. The Bosphorus, as it begins to</a>
<a id='line_127'>      open into the Propontis, passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon.</a>
<a id='line_128'>      The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks, a few years</a>
<a id='line_129'>      before the former; and the blindness of its founders, who</a>
<a id='line_130'>      overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast, has</a>
<a id='line_131'>      been stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt. 10</a>

<a id='line_182'>      The harbor of Constantinople, which may be considered as an arm</a>
<a id='line_183'>      of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      denomination of the _Golden Horn_. The curve which it describes</a>
<a id='line_185'>      might be compared to the horn of a stag, or as it should seem,</a>
<a id='line_186'>      with more propriety, to that of an ox. 11 The epithet of _golden_</a>
<a id='line_187'>      was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of</a>
<a id='line_189'>      Constantinople. The River Lycus, formed by the conflux of two</a>
<a id='line_190'>      little streams, pours into the harbor a perpetual supply of fresh</a>
<a id='line_191'>      water, which serves to cleanse the bottom, and to invite the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that</a>
<a id='line_193'>      convenient recess. As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt</a>

<a id='line_371'>      her seven hills, 22 the opposite shores of Europe and Asia; the</a>
<a id='line_372'>      climate was healthy and temperate, the soil fertile, the harbor</a>
<a id='line_373'>      secure and capacious; and the approach on the side of the</a>
<a id='line_374'>      continent was of small extent and easy defence. The Bosphorus and</a>
<a id='line_375'>      the Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of</a>
<a id='line_376'>      Constantinople; and the prince who possessed those important</a>
<a id='line_377'>      passages could always shut them against a naval enemy, and open</a>
<a id='line_378'>      them to the fleets of commerce. The preservation of the eastern</a>
<a id='line_379'>      provinces may, in some degree, be ascribed to the policy of</a>
<a id='line_380'>      Constantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who in the</a>
<a id='line_381'>      preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      Mediterranean, soon desisted from the exercise of piracy, and</a>
<a id='line_383'>      despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier. When the gates</a>
<a id='line_384'>      of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were shut, the capital still</a>
<a id='line_385'>      enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which</a>
<a id='line_386'>      could supply the wants, or gratify the luxury, of its numerous</a>

<a id='line_506'>      buildings, extending on one side up the harbor, and on the other</a>
<a id='line_507'>      along the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the</a>
<a id='line_508'>      sixth, and the broad summit of the seventh hill. The necessity of</a>
<a id='line_509'>      protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital</a>

<a id='line_512'>      eastern promontory to the golden gate, the extreme length of</a>
<a id='line_513'>      Constantinople was about three Roman miles; 33 the circumference</a>
<a id='line_514'>      measured between ten and eleven; and the surface might be</a>

<a id='line_659'>      for the principal Forum; 44 which appears to have been of a</a>
<a id='line_660'>      circular, or rather elliptical form. The two opposite entrances</a>
<a id='line_661'>      formed triumphal arches; the porticos, which enclosed it on every</a>

<a id='line_663'>      occupied by a lofty column, of which a mutilated fragment is now</a>
<a id='line_664'>      degraded by the appellation of the _burnt pillar_. This column</a>
<a id='line_665'>      was erected on a pedestal of white marble twenty feet high; and</a>
<a id='line_666'>      was composed of ten pieces of porphyry, each of which measured</a>

<a id='line_668'>      circumference. 45 On the summit of the pillar, above one hundred</a>
<a id='line_669'>      and twenty feet from the ground, stood the colossal statue of</a>

<a id='line_674'>      sceptre in his right hand, the globe of the world in his left,</a>
<a id='line_675'>      and a crown of rays glittering on his head. 46 The Circus, or</a>
<a id='line_676'>      Hippodrome, was a stately building about four hundred paces in</a>
<a id='line_677'>      length, and one hundred in breadth. 47 The space between the two</a>
<a id='line_678'>      _met¾_ or goals were filled with statues and obelisks; and we may</a>
<a id='line_679'>      still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity; the bodies of</a>
<a id='line_680'>      three serpents, twisted into one pillar of brass. Their triple</a>
<a id='line_681'>      heads had once supported the golden tripod which, after the</a>
<a id='line_682'>      defeat of Xerxes, was consecrated in the temple of Delphi by the</a>
<a id='line_683'>      victorious Greeks. 48 The beauty of the Hippodrome has been long</a>
<a id='line_684'>      since defaced by the rude hands of the Turkish conquerors; 4811</a>
<a id='line_685'>      but, under the similar appellation of Atmeidan, it still serves</a>
<a id='line_686'>      as a place of exercise for their horses. From the throne, whence</a>
<a id='line_687'>      the emperor viewed the Circensian games, a winding staircase 49</a>
<a id='line_688'>      descended to the palace; a magnificent edifice, which scarcely</a>
<a id='line_689'>      yielded to the residence of Rome itself, and which, together with</a>
<a id='line_690'>      the dependent courts, gardens, and porticos, covered a</a>

<a id='line_1397'>      perpetuating an order, which was still considered as honorable</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      and sacred. 96 But these artificial supplies (in which the</a>

<a id='line_1403'>      imperfect tradition, that the Patricians had once been the first</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      of the Romans. To form a body of nobles, whose influence may</a>

<a id='line_1751'>      execution, or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      honorable kind of exile. These prerogatives were reserved to the</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      pr¾fects, who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      of gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      of a few ounces. 114 This distinction, which seems to grant the</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      larger, while it denies the smaller degree of authority, was</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      founded on a very rational motive. The smaller degree was</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      infinitely more liable to abuse. The passions of a provincial</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject;</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of humanity, he</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood. It may</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      likewise be considered, that exile, considerable fines, or the</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      choice of an easy death, relate more particularly to the rich and</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      the noble; and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      resentment of a provincial magistrate, were thus removed from his</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      the Pr¾torian pr¾fect. 2. As it was reasonably apprehended that</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      the integrity of the judge might be biased, if his interest was</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      concerned, or his affections were engaged, the strictest</a>

<a id='line_1776'>      within the extent of his jurisdiction. 117 Notwithstanding these</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      rigorous precautions, the emperor Constantine, after a reign of</a>

<a id='line_1830'>      the most famous school was that of Berytus, 120 on the coast of</a>

<a id='line_1842'>      pounds of gold, to defend the causes of the treasury. The first</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      experiment was made of their judicial talents, by appointing them</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates; from thence</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      they had pleaded. They obtained the government of a province;</a>

<a id='line_1848'>      ascended, by successive steps, to the _illustrious_ dignities of</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      the state. 121 In the practice of the bar, these men had</a>

<a id='line_1855'>      advocates, who have filled the most important stations, with pure</a>

<a id='line_1927'>      depended on them alone, and they successively appeared on their</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      tribunal in the robes of civil magistracy, and in complete armor</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      at the head of the Roman legions. 124 The influence of the</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      revenue, the authority of law, and the command of a military</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      force, concurred to render their power supreme and absolute; and</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance, the loyal</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      province which they involved in their rebellion was scarcely</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      sensible of any change in its political state. From the time of</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      Commodus to the reign of Constantine, near one hundred governors</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      might be enumerated, who, with various success, erected the</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      standard of revolt; and though the innocent were too often</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      sacrificed, the guilty might be sometimes prevented, by the</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      suspicious cruelty of their master. 125 To secure his throne and</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      the public tranquillity from these formidable servants,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      Constantine resolved to divide the military from the civil</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      administration, and to establish, as a permanent and professional</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      distinction, a practice which had been adopted only as an</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      occasional expedient. The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      Pr¾torian pr¾fects over the armies of the empire, was transferred</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      to the two _masters-general_ whom he instituted, the one for the</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      _cavalry_, the other for the _infantry;_ and though each of these</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      _illustrious_ officers was more peculiarly responsible for the</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      discipline of those troops which were under his immediate</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      inspection, they both indifferently commanded in the field the</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      several bodies, whether of horse or foot, which were united in</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      the same army. 126 Their number was soon doubled by the division</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      of the east and west; and as separate generals of the same rank</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      and title were appointed on the four important frontiers of the</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      Rhine, of the Upper and the Lower Danube, and of the Euphrates,</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      the defence of the Roman empire was at length committed to eight</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      masters-general of the cavalry and infantry. Under their orders,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      thirty-five military commanders were stationed in the provinces:</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      three in Britain, six in Gaul, one in Spain, one in Italy, five</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      on the Upper, and four on the Lower Danube; in Asia, eight, three</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      in Egypt, and four in Africa. The titles of _counts_, and</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      _dukes_, 127 by which they were properly distinguished, have</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      obtained in modern languages so very different a sense, that the</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      use of them may occasion some surprise. But it should be</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      recollected, that the second of those appellations is only a</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      corruption of the Latin word, which was indiscriminately applied</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      to any military chief. All these provincial generals were</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      therefore _dukes;_ but no more than ten among them were dignified</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      with the rank of _counts_ or companions, a title of honor, or</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      rather of favor, which had been recently invented in the court of</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      Constantine. A gold belt was the ensign which distinguished the</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      office of the counts and dukes; and besides their pay, they</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      received a liberal allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      and ninety servants, and one hundred and fifty-eight horses. They</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      were strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      related to the administration of justice or the revenue; but the</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      command which they exercised over the troops of their department,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      was independent of the authority of the magistrates. About the</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      same time that Constantine gave a legal sanction to the</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      ecclesiastical order, he instituted in the Roman empire the nice</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      balance of the civil and the military powers. The emulation, and</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      sometimes the discord, which reigned between two professions of</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      opposite interests and incompatible manners, was productive of</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      beneficial and of pernicious consequences. It was seldom to be</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      expected that the general and the civil governor of a province</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      should either conspire for the disturbance, or should unite for</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      the service, of their country. While the one delayed to offer the</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      assistance which the other disdained to solicit, the troops very</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      frequently remained without orders or without supplies; the</a>

<a id='line_2117'>      into several hundred cohorts of infantry, and squadrons of</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      cavalry. Their arms, and titles, and ensigns, were calculated to</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      inspire terror, and to display the variety of nations who marched</a>

<a id='line_2154'>      duty; the subjects, or at least the nobles, of a monarchy, are</a>

<a id='line_2157'>      service by the hopes of profit, or compelled by the dread of</a>

<a id='line_2160'>      invention of new emolument and indulgences, which, in the opinion</a>

<a id='line_2165'>      difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      volunteers, obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      coercive methods. The lands bestowed on the veterans, as the free</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      reward of their valor were henceforward granted under a condition</a>

<a id='line_2174'>      annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small</a>

<a id='line_2241'>      delighted in war, and who found it more profitable to defend than</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      to ravage the provinces, were enrolled, not only in the</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      auxiliaries of their respective nations, but in the legions</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      themselves, and among the most distinguished of the Palatine</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      troops. As they freely mingled with the subjects of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      they gradually learned to despise their manners, and to imitate</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      their arts. They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      of Rome had exacted from their ignorance, while they acquired the</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      supported her declining greatness. The Barbarian soldiers, who</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      displayed any military talents, were advanced, without exception,</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      to the most important commands; and the names of the tribunes, of</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      the counts and dukes, and of the generals themselves, betray a</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      foreign origin, which they no longer condescended to disguise.</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      They were often intrusted with the conduct of a war against their</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      countrymen; and though most of them preferred the ties of</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      allegiance to those of blood, they did not always avoid the</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      guilt, or at least the suspicion, of holding a treasonable</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      correspondence with the enemy, of inviting his invasion, or of</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      sparing his retreat. The camps and the palace of the son of</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      Constantine were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks,</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      who preserved the strictest connection with each other, and with</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      their country, and who resented every personal affront as a</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      national indignity. 140 When the tyrant Caligula was suspected of</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      an intention to invest a very extraordinary candidate with the</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      consular robes, the sacrilegious profanation would have scarcely</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      excited less astonishment, if, instead of a horse, the noblest</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      chieftain of Germany or Britain had been the object of his</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      choice. The revolution of three centuries had produced so</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people, that, with</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      the public approbation, Constantine showed his successors the</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      example of bestowing the honors of the consulship on the</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      Barbarians, who, by their merit and services, had deserved to be</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      ranked among the first of the Romans. 141 But as these hardy</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      veterans, who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of</a>

<a id='line_2298'>      the court diffused their delegated authority over the provinces</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      and armies, the emperor conferred the rank of _Illustrious_ on</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      seven of his more immediate servants, to whose fidelity he</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      intrusted his safety, or his counsels, or his treasures. 1. The</a>
<a id='line_2302'>      private apartments of the palace were governed by a favorite</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      eunuch, who, in the language of that age, was styled the</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      _pr¾positus_, or pr¾fect of the sacred bed-chamber. His duty was</a>
<a id='line_2305'>      to attend the emperor in his hours of state, or in those of</a>
<a id='line_2306'>      amusement, and to perform about his person all those menial</a>
<a id='line_2307'>      services, which can only derive their splendor from the influence</a>
<a id='line_2308'>      of royalty. Under a prince who deserved to reign, the great</a>
<a id='line_2309'>      chamberlain (for such we may call him) was a useful and humble</a>
<a id='line_2310'>      domestic; but an artful domestic, who improves every occasion of</a>
<a id='line_2311'>      unguarded confidence, will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind</a>
<a id='line_2312'>      that ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      seldom obtain. The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius, who were</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      invisible to their subjects, and contemptible to their enemies,</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      exalted the pr¾fects of their bed-chamber above the heads of all</a>
<a id='line_2316'>      the ministers of the palace; 142 and even his deputy, the first</a>
<a id='line_2317'>      of the splendid train of slaves who waited in the presence, was</a>
<a id='line_2318'>      thought worthy to rank before the _respectable_ proconsuls of</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      Greece or Asia. The jurisdiction of the chamberlain was</a>
<a id='line_2320'>      acknowledged by the _counts_, or superintendents, who regulated</a>
<a id='line_2321'>      the two important provinces of the magnificence of the wardrobe,</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      and of the luxury of the Imperial table. 143 2. The principal</a>
<a id='line_2323'>      administration of public affairs was committed to the diligence</a>
<a id='line_2324'>      and abilities of the _master of the offices_. 144 He was the</a>
<a id='line_2325'>      supreme magistrate of the palace, inspected the discipline of the</a>
<a id='line_2326'>      civil and military _schools_, and received appeals from all parts</a>
<a id='line_2327'>      of the empire, in the causes which related to that numerous army</a>
<a id='line_2328'>      of privileged persons, who, as the servants of the court, had</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the</a>
<a id='line_2330'>      authority of the ordinary judges. The correspondence between the</a>
<a id='line_2331'>      prince and his subjects was managed by the four _scrinia_, or</a>
<a id='line_2332'>      offices of this minister of state. The first was appropriated to</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      memorials, the second to epistles, the third to petitions, and</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind. Each of</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      these was directed by an _inferior_ master of _respectable_</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      dignity, and the whole business was despatched by a hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      forty-eight secretaries, chosen for the most part from the</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      profession of the law, on account of the variety of abstracts of</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      of their several functions. From a condescension, which in former</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      ages would have been esteemed unworthy the Roman majesty, a</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language; and</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      Barbarians; but the department of foreign affairs, which</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      constitutes so essential a part of modern policy, seldom diverted</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      the attention of the master of the offices. His mind was more</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      arsenals of the empire. There were thirty-four cities, fifteen in</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      the East, and nineteen in the West, in which regular companies of</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armor,</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      offensive weapons of all sorts, and military engines, which were</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      deposited in the arsenals, and occasionally delivered for the</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      service of the troops. 3. In the course of nine centuries, the</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      office of _qu¾stor_ had experienced a very singular revolution.</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      In the infancy of Rome, two inferior magistrates were annually</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      elected by the people, to relieve the consuls from the invidious</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      management of the public treasure; 145 a similar assistant was</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      granted to every proconsul, and to every pr¾tor, who exercised a</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      military or provincial command; with the extent of conquest, the</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      two qu¾stors were gradually multiplied to the number of four, of</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      eight, of twenty, and, for a short time, perhaps, of forty; 146</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      and the noblest citizens ambitiously solicited an office which</a>
<a id='line_2363'>      gave them a seat in the senate, and a just hope of obtaining the</a>
<a id='line_2364'>      honors of the republic. Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the</a>
<a id='line_2365'>      freedom of election, he consented to accept the annual privilege</a>
<a id='line_2366'>      of recommending, or rather indeed of nominating, a certain</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      proportion of candidates; and it was his custom to select one of</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      these distinguished youths, to read his orations or epistles in</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      the assemblies of the senate. 147 The practice of Augustus was</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      imitated by succeeding princes; the occasional commission was</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      established as a permanent office; and the favored qu¾stor,</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      assuming a new and more illustrious character, alone survived the</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      suppression of his ancient and useless colleagues. 148 As the</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      orations which he composed in the name of the emperor, 149</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      acquired the force, and, at length, the form, of absolute edicts,</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      he was considered as the representative of the legislative power,</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      the oracle of the council, and the original source of the civil</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      jurisprudence. He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      supreme judicature of the Imperial consistory, with the Pr¾torian</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      pr¾fects, and the master of the offices; and he was frequently</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges: but as he was</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business, his leisure</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      eloquence, which, in the corruption of taste and language, still</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      preserves the majesty of the Roman laws. 150 In some respects,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      the office of the Imperial qu¾stor may be compared with that of a</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      modern chancellor; but the use of a great seal, which seems to</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      have been adopted by the illiterate barbarians, was never</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      introduced to attest the public acts of the emperors. 4. The</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      extraordinary title of _count of the sacred largesses_ was</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      bestowed on the treasurer-general of the revenue, with the</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      intention perhaps of inculcating, that every payment flowed from</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      the voluntary bounty of the monarch. To conceive the almost</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      infinite detail of the annual and daily expense of the civil and</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      military administration in every part of a great empire, would</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      exceed the powers of the most vigorous imagination.</a>
<a id='line_2397'></a>
<a id='line_2398'>      The actual account employed several hundred persons, distributed</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      into eleven different offices, which were artfully contrived to</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      examine and control their respective operations. The multitude of</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      these agents had a natural tendency to increase; and it was more</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      than once thought expedient to dismiss to their native homes the</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      useless supernumeraries, who, deserting their honest labors, had</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      pressed with too much eagerness into the lucrative profession of</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      the finances. 151 Twenty-nine provincial receivers, of whom</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      eighteen were honored with the title of count, corresponded with</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      the treasurer; and he extended his jurisdiction over the mines</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      from whence the precious metals were extracted, over the mints,</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      in which they were converted into the current coin, and over the</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      public treasuries of the most important cities, where they were</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      deposited for the service of the state. The foreign trade of the</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      empire was regulated by this minister, who directed likewise all</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      the linen and woollen manufactures, in which the successive</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      operations of spinning, weaving, and dyeing were executed,</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      chiefly by women of a servile condition, for the use of the</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      palace and army. Twenty-six of these institutions are enumerated</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      in the West, where the arts had been more recently introduced,</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      and a still larger proportion may be allowed for the industrious</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      provinces of the East. 152 5. Besides the public revenue, which</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      an absolute monarch might levy and expend according to his</a>
<a id='line_2421'>      pleasure, the emperors, in the capacity of opulent citizens,</a>
<a id='line_2422'>      possessed a very extensive property, which was administered by</a>
<a id='line_2423'>      the _count_ or treasurer of _the private estate_. Some part had</a>
<a id='line_2424'>      perhaps been the ancient demesnes of kings and republics; some</a>
<a id='line_2425'>      accessions might be derived from the families which were</a>
<a id='line_2426'>      successively invested with the purple; but the most considerable</a>
<a id='line_2427'>      portion flowed from the impure source of confiscations and</a>
<a id='line_2428'>      forfeitures. The Imperial estates were scattered through the</a>
<a id='line_2429'>      provinces, from Mauritania to Britain; but the rich and fertile</a>
<a id='line_2430'>      soil of Cappadocia tempted the monarch to acquire in that country</a>
<a id='line_2431'>      his fairest possessions, 153 and either Constantine or his</a>
<a id='line_2432'>      successors embraced the occasion of justifying avarice by</a>
<a id='line_2433'>      religious zeal. They suppressed the rich temple of Comana, where</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      the high priest of the goddess of war supported the dignity of a</a>
<a id='line_2435'>      sovereign prince; and they applied to their private use the</a>
<a id='line_2436'>      consecrated lands, which were inhabited by six thousand subjects</a>
<a id='line_2437'>      or slaves of the deity and her ministers. 154 But these were not</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      the valuable inhabitants: the plains that stretch from the foot</a>
<a id='line_2439'>      of Mount Arg¾us to the banks of the Sarus, bred a generous race</a>
<a id='line_2440'>      of horses, renowned above all others in the ancient world for</a>
<a id='line_2441'>      their majestic shape and incomparable swiftness. These _sacred_</a>
<a id='line_2442'>      animals, destined for the service of the palace and the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_2443'>      games, were protected by the laws from the profanation of a</a>
<a id='line_2444'>      vulgar master. 155 The demesnes of Cappadocia were important</a>
<a id='line_2445'>      enough to require the inspection of a count; 156 officers of an</a>
<a id='line_2446'>      inferior rank were stationed in the other parts of the empire;</a>
<a id='line_2447'>      and the deputies of the private, as well as those of the public,</a>
<a id='line_2448'>      treasurer were maintained in the exercise of their independent</a>
<a id='line_2449'>      functions, and encouraged to control the authority of the</a>
<a id='line_2450'>      provincial magistrates. 157 6, 7. The chosen bands of cavalry and</a>
<a id='line_2451'>      infantry, which guarded the person of the emperor, were under the</a>
<a id='line_2452'>      immediate command of the _two counts of the domestics_. The whole</a>
<a id='line_2453'>      number consisted of three thousand five hundred men, divided into</a>
<a id='line_2454'>      seven _schools_, or troops, of five hundred each; and in the</a>
<a id='line_2455'>      East, this honorable service was almost entirely appropriated to</a>
<a id='line_2456'>      the Armenians. Whenever, on public ceremonies, they were drawn up</a>
<a id='line_2457'>      in the courts and porticos of the palace, their lofty stature,</a>
<a id='line_2458'>      silent order, and splendid arms of silver and gold, displayed a</a>
<a id='line_2459'>      martial pomp not unworthy of the Roman majesty. 158 From the</a>
<a id='line_2460'>      seven schools two companies of horse and foot were selected, of</a>
<a id='line_2461'>      the _protectors_, whose advantageous station was the hope and</a>
<a id='line_2462'>      reward of the most deserving soldiers. They mounted guard in the</a>
<a id='line_2463'>      interior apartments, and were occasionally despatched into the</a>
<a id='line_2464'>      provinces, to execute with celerity and vigor the orders of their</a>
<a id='line_2465'>      master. 159 The counts of the domestics had succeeded to the</a>
<a id='line_2466'>      office of the Pr¾torian pr¾fects; like the pr¾fects, they aspired</a>
<a id='line_2467'>      from the service of the palace to the command of armies.</a>

<a id='line_2740'>      The name and use of the _indictions_, 170 which serve to</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      ascertain the chronology of the middle ages, were derived from</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      the regular practice of the Roman tributes. 171 The emperor</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      subscribed with his own hand, and in purple ink, the solemn</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      edict, or indiction, which was fixed up in the principal city of</a>
<a id='line_2745'>      each diocese, during two months previous to the first day of</a>
<a id='line_2746'>      September. And by a very easy connection of ideas, the word</a>
<a id='line_2747'>      _indiction_ was transferred to the measure of tribute which it</a>
<a id='line_2748'>      prescribed, and to the annual term which it allowed for the</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      payment. This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      to the real and imaginary wants of the state; but as often as the</a>
<a id='line_2751'>      expense exceeded the revenue, or the revenue fell short of the</a>
<a id='line_2752'>      computation, an additional tax, under the name of</a>
<a id='line_2753'>      _superindiction_, was imposed on the people, and the most</a>
<a id='line_2754'>      valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the</a>
<a id='line_2755'>      Pr¾torian pr¾fects, who, on some occasions, were permitted to</a>
<a id='line_2756'>      provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the</a>
<a id='line_2757'>      public service. The execution of these laws (which it would be</a>
<a id='line_2758'>      tedious to pursue in their minute and intricate detail) consisted</a>
<a id='line_2759'>      of two distinct operations: the resolving the general imposition</a>
<a id='line_2760'>      into its constituent parts, which were assessed on the provinces,</a>
<a id='line_2761'>      the cities, and the individuals of the Roman world; and the</a>
<a id='line_2762'>      collecting the separate contributions of the individuals, the</a>
<a id='line_2763'>      cities, and the provinces, till the accumulated sums were poured</a>
<a id='line_2764'>      into the Imperial treasuries. But as the account between the</a>
<a id='line_2765'>      monarch and the subject was perpetually open, and as the renewal</a>
<a id='line_2766'>      of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding</a>
<a id='line_2767'>      obligation, the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the</a>
<a id='line_2768'>      same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution. Whatever</a>
<a id='line_2769'>      was honorable or important in the administration of the revenue,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      was committed to the wisdom of the pr¾fects, and their provincia.</a>
<a id='line_2771'>      representatives; the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd</a>
<a id='line_2772'>      of subordinate officers, some of whom depended on the treasurer,</a>
<a id='line_2773'>      others on the governor of the province; and who, in the</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction, had frequent</a>
<a id='line_2775'>      opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the</a>
<a id='line_2776'>      people. The laborious offices, which could be productive only of</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      envy and reproach, of expense and danger, were imposed on the</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      _Decurions_, who formed the corporations of the cities, and whom</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      the severity of the Imperial laws had condemned to sustain the</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      burdens of civil society. 172 The whole landed property of the</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      empire (without excepting the patrimonial estates of the monarch)</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      was the object of ordinary taxation; and every new purchaser</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      contracted the obligations of the former proprietor. An accurate</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      _census_, 173 or survey, was the only equitable mode of</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      ascertaining the proportion which every citizen should be obliged</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      to contribute for the public service; and from the well-known</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      period of the indictions, there is reason to believe that this</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the regular</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      distance of fifteen years. The lands were measured by surveyors,</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      who were sent into the provinces; their nature, whether arable or</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      pasture, or vineyards or woods, was distinctly reported; and an</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      estimate was made of their common value from the average produce</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      of five years. The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      essential part of the report; an oath was administered to the</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      proprietors, which bound them to disclose the true state of their</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      affairs; and their attempts to prevaricate, or elude the</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      intention of the legislator, were severely watched, and punished</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      as a capital crime, which included the double guilt of treason</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      and sacrilege. 174 A large portion of the tribute was paid in</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      money; and of the current coin of the empire, gold alone could be</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      legally accepted. 175 The remainder of the taxes, according to</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      the proportions determined by the annual indiction, was furnished</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      in a manner still more direct, and still more oppressive.</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      According to the different nature of lands, their real produce in</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      the various articles of wine or oil, corn or barley, wood or</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      iron, was transported by the labor or at the expense of the</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      provincials 17511 to the Imperial magazines, from whence they</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      were occasionally distributed for the use of the court, of the</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      army, and of two capitals, Rome and Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      considerable purchases, that they were strictly prohibited from</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      allowing any compensation, or from receiving in money the value</a>
<a id='line_2813'>      of those supplies which were exacted in kind. In the primitive</a>
<a id='line_2814'>      simplicity of small communities, this method may be well adapted</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people; but it</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude, and of the utmost</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      strictness, which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and</a>
<a id='line_2819'>      the arts of fraud. 176 The agriculture of the Roman provinces was</a>
<a id='line_2820'>      insensibly ruined, and, in the progress of despotism which tends</a>
<a id='line_2821'>      to disappoint its own purpose, the emperors were obliged to</a>
<a id='line_2822'>      derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts, or the remission</a>
<a id='line_2823'>      of tributes, which their subjects were utterly incapable of</a>
<a id='line_2824'>      paying. According to the new division of Italy, the fertile and</a>
<a id='line_2825'>      happy province of Campania, the scene of the early victories and</a>
<a id='line_2826'>      of the delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome, extended</a>

<a id='line_2828'>      Within sixty years after the death of Constantine, and on the</a>

<a id='line_2833'>      not yet been seen in Italy, the cause of this amazing desolation,</a>
<a id='line_2834'>      which is recorded in the laws, can be ascribed only to the</a>

<a id='line_2988'>      I. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable constitution of</a>
<a id='line_2989'>      human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of</a>
<a id='line_2990'>      property, the most numerous part of the community would be</a>
<a id='line_2991'>      deprived of their subsistence, by the equal assessment of a tax</a>
<a id='line_2992'>      from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue.</a>
<a id='line_2993'>      Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation; but in</a>
<a id='line_2994'>      the practice, this unjust equality was no longer felt, as the</a>
<a id='line_2995'>      tribute was collected on the principle of a _real_, not of a</a>
<a id='line_2996'>      _personal_ imposition. 18011 Several indigent citizens</a>
<a id='line_2997'>      contributed to compose a single _head_, or share of taxation;</a>
<a id='line_2998'>      while the wealthy provincial, in proportion to his fortune, alone</a>
<a id='line_2999'>      represented several of those imaginary beings. In a poetical</a>
<a id='line_3000'>      request, addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the</a>
<a id='line_3001'>      Roman princes who reigned in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris</a>
<a id='line_3002'>      personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the</a>
<a id='line_3003'>      Geryon of the Grecian fables, and entreats the new Hercules that</a>
<a id='line_3004'>      he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting</a>
<a id='line_3005'>      off three of his heads. 181 The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded</a>
<a id='line_3006'>      the customary wealth of a poet; but if he had pursued the</a>
<a id='line_3007'>      allusion, he might have painted many of the Gallic nobles with</a>
<a id='line_3008'>      the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, spreading over the face of</a>
<a id='line_3009'>      the country, and devouring the substance of a hundred families.</a>
<a id='line_3010'>      II. The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds</a>
<a id='line_3011'>      sterling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be</a>
<a id='line_3012'>      rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of</a>
<a id='line_3013'>      the same country, as it is now governed by the absolute monarch</a>
<a id='line_3014'>      of an industrious, wealthy, and affectionate people. The taxes of</a>
<a id='line_3015'>      France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by flattery, beyond</a>
<a id='line_3016'>      the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling, which ought</a>
<a id='line_3017'>      perhaps to be shared among four and twenty millions of</a>
<a id='line_3018'>      inhabitants. 182 Seven millions of these, in the capacity of</a>
<a id='line_3019'>      fathers, or brothers, or husbands, may discharge the obligations</a>
<a id='line_3020'>      of the remaining multitude of women and children; yet the equal</a>
<a id='line_3021'>      proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above</a>
<a id='line_3022'>      fifty shillings of our money, instead of a proportion almost four</a>
<a id='line_3023'>      times as considerable, which was regularly imposed on their</a>
<a id='line_3024'>      Gallic ancestors. The reason of this difference may be found, not</a>
<a id='line_3025'>      so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver, as</a>
<a id='line_3026'>      in the different state of society, in ancient Gaul and in modern</a>
<a id='line_3027'>      France. In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of</a>
<a id='line_3028'>      every subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they are levied</a>
<a id='line_3029'>      on property or on consumption, may be fairly divided among the</a>
<a id='line_3030'>      whole body of the nation. But the far greater part of the lands</a>
<a id='line_3031'>      of ancient Gaul, as well as of the other provinces of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_3032'>      world, were cultivated by slaves, or by peasants, whose dependent</a>
<a id='line_3033'>      condition was a less rigid servitude. 183 In such a state the</a>
<a id='line_3034'>      poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed</a>
<a id='line_3035'>      the fruits of their labor; and as the rolls of tribute were</a>
<a id='line_3036'>      filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the</a>
<a id='line_3037'>      means of an honorable, or at least of a decent subsistence, the</a>
<a id='line_3038'>      comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the</a>
<a id='line_3039'>      high rate of their capitation. The truth of this assertion may be</a>
<a id='line_3040'>      illustrated by the following example: The ®dui, one of the most</a>
<a id='line_3041'>      powerful and civilized tribes or _cities_ of Gaul, occupied an</a>
<a id='line_3042'>      extent of territory, which now contains about five hundred</a>
<a id='line_3043'>      thousand inhabitants, in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun</a>
<a id='line_3044'>      and Nevers; 184 and with the probable accession of those of</a>
<a id='line_3045'>      Ch‰lons and Maon, 185 the population would amount to eight</a>
<a id='line_3046'>      hundred thousand souls. In the time of Constantine, the territory</a>
<a id='line_3047'>      of the ®dui afforded no more than twenty-five thousand _heads_ of</a>
<a id='line_3048'>      capitation, of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince</a>
<a id='line_3049'>      from the intolerable weight of tribute. 186 A just analogy would</a>
<a id='line_3050'>      seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian, 187</a>
<a id='line_3051'>      that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number</a>
<a id='line_3052'>      of half a million; and if, in the ordinary administration of</a>
<a id='line_3053'>      government, their annual payments may be computed at about four</a>
<a id='line_3054'>      millions and a half of our money, it would appear, that although</a>
<a id='line_3055'>      the share of each individual was four times as considerable, a</a>
<a id='line_3056'>      fourth part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the</a>
<a id='line_3057'>      Imperial province of Gaul. The exactions of Constantius may be</a>
<a id='line_3058'>      calculated at seven millions sterling, which were reduced to two</a>

<a id='line_3221'>      These general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute</a>
<a id='line_3222'>      authority of the monarch; but the occasional offerings of the</a>
<a id='line_3223'>      _coronary gold_ still retained the name and semblance of popular</a>
<a id='line_3224'>      consent. It was an ancient custom that the allies of the</a>
<a id='line_3225'>      republic, who ascribed their safety or deliverance to the success</a>
<a id='line_3226'>      of the Roman arms, and even the cities of Italy, who admired the</a>
<a id='line_3227'>      virtues of their victorious general, adorned the pomp of his</a>
<a id='line_3228'>      triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold, which after</a>
<a id='line_3229'>      the ceremony were consecrated in the temple of Jupiter, to remain</a>
<a id='line_3230'>      a lasting monument of his glory to future ages. The progress of</a>
<a id='line_3231'>      zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number, and increased the</a>
<a id='line_3232'>      size, of these popular donations; and the triumph of C¾sar was</a>
<a id='line_3233'>      enriched with two thousand eight hundred and twenty-two massy</a>
<a id='line_3234'>      crowns, whose weight amounted to twenty thousand four hundred and</a>
<a id='line_3235'>      fourteen pounds of gold. This treasure was immediately melted</a>
<a id='line_3236'>      down by the prudent dictator, who was satisfied that it would be</a>
<a id='line_3237'>      more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods: his example</a>
<a id='line_3238'>      was imitated by his successors; and the custom was introduced of</a>
<a id='line_3239'>      exchanging these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable</a>

<a id='line_3241'>      spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty;</a>
<a id='line_3242'>      and instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph, it</a>
<a id='line_3243'>      was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of</a>
<a id='line_3244'>      the monarchy, as often as the emperor condescended to announce</a>
<a id='line_3245'>      his accession, his consulship, the birth of a son, the creation</a>
<a id='line_3246'>      of a C¾sar, a victory over the Barbarians, or any other real or</a>
<a id='line_3247'>      imaginary event which graced the annals of his reign. The</a>
<a id='line_3248'>      peculiar free gift of the senate of Rome was fixed by custom at</a>
<a id='line_3249'>      sixteen hundred pounds of gold, or about sixty-four thousand</a>
<a id='line_3250'>      pounds sterling. The oppressed subjects celebrated their own</a>
