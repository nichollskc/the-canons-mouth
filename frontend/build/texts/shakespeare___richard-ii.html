<a id='line_38'>Enter RICHARD, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other NOBLES and attendants</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>  KING RICHARD. Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_41'>    Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</a>
<a id='line_42'>    Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,</a>
<a id='line_43'>    Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal,</a>
<a id='line_44'>    Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</a>
<a id='line_45'>    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</a>
<a id='line_46'>  GAUNT. I have, my liege.</a>
<a id='line_47'>  KING RICHARD. Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him</a>
<a id='line_48'>    If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,</a>
<a id='line_49'>    Or worthily, as a good subject should,</a>
<a id='line_50'>    On some known ground of treachery in him?</a>
<a id='line_51'>  GAUNT. As near as I could sift him on that argument,</a>
<a id='line_52'>    On some apparent danger seen in him</a>
<a id='line_53'>    Aim'd at your Highness-no inveterate malice.</a>
<a id='line_54'>  KING RICHARD. Then call them to our presence: face to face</a>
<a id='line_55'>    And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</a>
<a id='line_56'>    The accuser and the accused freely speak.</a>
<a id='line_57'>    High-stomach'd are they both and full of ire,</a>
<a id='line_58'>    In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>         Enter BOLINGBROKE and MOWBRAY</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>  BOLINGBROKE. Many years of happy days befall</a>
<a id='line_63'>    My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</a>
<a id='line_64'>  MOWBRAY. Each day still better other's happiness</a>
<a id='line_65'>    Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,</a>
<a id='line_66'>    Add an immortal title to your crown!</a>
<a id='line_67'>  KING RICHARD. We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,</a>
<a id='line_68'>    As well appeareth by the cause you come;</a>
<a id='line_69'>    Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.</a>
<a id='line_70'>    Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</a>
<a id='line_71'>    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</a>
<a id='line_72'>  BOLINGBROKE. First-heaven be the record to my speech!</a>
<a id='line_73'>    In the devotion of a subject's love,</a>
<a id='line_74'>    Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince,</a>
<a id='line_75'>    And free from other misbegotten hate,</a>
<a id='line_76'>    Come I appellant to this princely presence.</a>
<a id='line_77'>    Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</a>
<a id='line_78'>    And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</a>
<a id='line_79'>    My body shall make good upon this earth,</a>
<a id='line_80'>    Or my divine soul answer it in heaven-</a>
<a id='line_81'>    Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</a>
<a id='line_82'>    Too good to be so, and too bad to live,</a>
<a id='line_83'>    Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</a>
<a id='line_84'>    The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</a>
<a id='line_86'>    With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;</a>
<a id='line_87'>    And wish-so please my sovereign-ere I move,</a>
<a id='line_88'>    What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.</a>
<a id='line_89'>  MOWBRAY. Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.</a>
<a id='line_90'>    'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</a>
<a id='line_91'>    The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</a>
<a id='line_92'>    Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</a>
<a id='line_93'>    The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this.</a>
<a id='line_94'>    Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</a>
<a id='line_95'>    As to be hush'd and nought at an to say.</a>
<a id='line_96'>    First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me</a>
<a id='line_97'>    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</a>
<a id='line_98'>    Which else would post until it had return'd</a>
<a id='line_99'>    These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</a>
<a id='line_100'>    Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</a>
<a id='line_101'>    And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</a>
<a id='line_102'>    I do defy him, and I spit at him,</a>
<a id='line_103'>    Call him a slanderous coward and a villain;</a>
<a id='line_104'>    Which to maintain, I would allow him odds</a>
<a id='line_105'>    And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</a>
<a id='line_106'>    Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</a>
<a id='line_107'>    Or any other ground inhabitable</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Meantime let this defend my loyalty-</a>
<a id='line_110'>    By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie</a>
<a id='line_111'>  BOLINGBROKE. Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</a>
<a id='line_112'>    Disclaiming here the kindred of the King;</a>
<a id='line_113'>    And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</a>
<a id='line_114'>    Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</a>
<a id='line_115'>    If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</a>
<a id='line_116'>    As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop.</a>
<a id='line_117'>    By that and all the rites of knighthood else</a>
<a id='line_118'>    Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</a>
<a id='line_119'>    What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.</a>
<a id='line_120'>  MOWBRAY. I take it up; and by that sword I swear</a>
<a id='line_121'>    Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder</a>
<a id='line_122'>    I'll answer thee in any fair degree</a>
<a id='line_123'>    Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;</a>
<a id='line_124'>    And when I mount, alive may I not light</a>
<a id='line_125'>    If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</a>
<a id='line_126'>  KING RICHARD. What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?</a>
<a id='line_127'>    It must be great that can inherit us</a>
<a id='line_128'>    So much as of a thought of ill in him.</a>
<a id='line_129'>  BOLINGBROKE. Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true-</a>
<a id='line_130'>    That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles</a>
<a id='line_131'>    In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_132'>    The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments</a>
<a id='line_133'>    Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</a>
<a id='line_134'>    Besides, I say and will in battle prove-</a>
<a id='line_135'>    Or here, or elsewhere to the furthest verge</a>
<a id='line_136'>    That ever was survey'd by English eye-</a>
<a id='line_137'>    That all the treasons for these eighteen years</a>
<a id='line_138'>    Complotted and contrived in this land</a>
<a id='line_139'>    Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</a>
<a id='line_140'>    Further I say, and further will maintain</a>
<a id='line_141'>    Upon his bad life to make all this good,</a>
<a id='line_142'>    That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,</a>
<a id='line_143'>    Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</a>
<a id='line_144'>    And consequently, like a traitor coward,</a>
<a id='line_145'>    Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood;</a>
<a id='line_146'>    Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</a>
<a id='line_147'>    Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    To me for justice and rough chastisement;</a>
<a id='line_149'>    And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</a>
<a id='line_150'>    This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</a>
<a id='line_151'>  KING RICHARD. How high a pitch his resolution soars!</a>
<a id='line_152'>    Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</a>
<a id='line_153'>  MOWBRAY. O, let my sovereign turn away his face</a>
<a id='line_154'>    And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</a>
<a id='line_155'>    Till I have told this slander of his blood</a>
<a id='line_156'>    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</a>
<a id='line_157'>  KING RICHARD. Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and cars.</a>
<a id='line_158'>    Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,</a>
<a id='line_159'>    As he is but my father's brother's son,</a>
<a id='line_160'>    Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow,</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</a>
<a id='line_162'>    Should nothing privilege him nor partialize</a>
<a id='line_163'>    The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</a>
<a id='line_164'>    He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</a>
<a id='line_165'>    Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</a>
<a id='line_166'>  MOWBRAY. Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</a>
<a id='line_167'>    Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</a>
<a id='line_168'>    Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Disburs'd I duly to his Highness' soldiers;</a>
<a id='line_170'>    The other part reserv'd I by consent,</a>
<a id='line_171'>    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</a>
<a id='line_172'>    Upon remainder of a dear account</a>
<a id='line_173'>    Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</a>
<a id='line_174'>    Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death-</a>
<a id='line_175'>    I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</a>
<a id='line_176'>    Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</a>
<a id='line_177'>    For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_178'>    The honourable father to my foe,</a>
<a id='line_179'>    Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</a>
<a id='line_180'>    A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;</a>
<a id='line_181'>    But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament</a>
<a id='line_182'>    I did confess it, and exactly begg'd</a>
<a id='line_183'>    Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it.</a>
<a id='line_184'>    This is my fault. As for the rest appeal'd,</a>
<a id='line_185'>    It issues from the rancour of a villain,</a>
<a id='line_186'>    A recreant and most degenerate traitor;</a>
<a id='line_187'>    Which in myself I boldly will defend,</a>
<a id='line_188'>    And interchangeably hurl down my gage</a>
<a id='line_189'>    Upon this overweening traitor's foot</a>
<a id='line_190'>    To prove myself a loyal gentleman</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.</a>
<a id='line_192'>    In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</a>
<a id='line_193'>    Your Highness to assign our trial day.</a>
<a id='line_194'>  KING RICHARD. Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Let's purge this choler without letting blood-</a>
<a id='line_196'>    This we prescribe, though no physician;</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Deep malice makes too deep incision.</a>
<a id='line_198'>    Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed:</a>
<a id='line_199'>    Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</a>
<a id='line_200'>    Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</a>
<a id='line_201'>    We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</a>
<a id='line_202'>  GAUNT. To be a make-peace shall become my age.</a>
<a id='line_203'>    Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.</a>
<a id='line_204'>  KING RICHARD. And, Norfolk, throw down his.</a>
<a id='line_205'>  GAUNT. When, Harry, when?</a>
<a id='line_206'>    Obedience bids I should not bid again.</a>
<a id='line_207'>  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, throw down; we bid.</a>
<a id='line_208'>    There is no boot.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  MOWBRAY. Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot;</a>
<a id='line_210'>    My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</a>
<a id='line_211'>    The one my duty owes; but my fair name,</a>
<a id='line_212'>    Despite of death, that lives upon my grave</a>
<a id='line_213'>    To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.</a>
<a id='line_214'>    I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffl'd here;</a>
<a id='line_215'>    Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,</a>
<a id='line_216'>    The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</a>
<a id='line_217'>    Which breath'd this poison.</a>
<a id='line_218'>  KING RICHARD. Rage must be withstood:</a>
<a id='line_219'>    Give me his gage-lions make leopards tame.</a>
<a id='line_220'>  MOWBRAY. Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,</a>
<a id='line_221'>    And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</a>
<a id='line_222'>    The purest treasure mortal times afford</a>
<a id='line_223'>    Is spotless reputation; that away,</a>
<a id='line_224'>    Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</a>
<a id='line_225'>    A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest</a>
<a id='line_226'>    Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</a>
<a id='line_227'>    Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;</a>
<a id='line_228'>    Take honour from me, and my life is done:</a>
<a id='line_229'>    Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;</a>
<a id='line_230'>    In that I live, and for that will I die.</a>
<a id='line_231'>  KING RICHARD. Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</a>
<a id='line_232'>  BOLINGBROKE. O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</a>
<a id='line_233'>    Shall I seem crest-fallen in my father's sight?</a>
<a id='line_234'>    Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</a>
<a id='line_235'>    Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue</a>
<a id='line_236'>    Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong</a>
<a id='line_237'>    Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear</a>
<a id='line_238'>    The slavish motive of recanting fear,</a>
<a id='line_239'>    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_240'>    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.</a>
<a id='line_241'>                                                      Exit GAUNT</a>
<a id='line_242'>  KING RICHARD. We were not born to sue, but to command;</a>
<a id='line_243'>    Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</a>
<a id='line_244'>    Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</a>
<a id='line_245'>    At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day.</a>
<a id='line_246'>    There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</a>
<a id='line_247'>    The swelling difference of your settled hate;</a>
<a id='line_248'>    Since we can not atone you, we shall see</a>
<a id='line_249'>    Justice design the victor's chivalry.</a>
<a id='line_250'>    Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms</a>
<a id='line_251'>    Be ready to direct these home alarms.                 Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_253'>SCENE 2. London. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace</a>

<a id='line_255'>Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>  GAUNT. Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood</a>
<a id='line_258'>    Doth more solicit me than your exclaims</a>
<a id='line_259'>    To stir against the butchers of his life!</a>
<a id='line_260'>    But since correction lieth in those hands</a>
<a id='line_261'>    Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</a>
<a id='line_262'>    Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;</a>
<a id='line_263'>    Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,</a>
<a id='line_264'>    Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.</a>
<a id='line_265'>  DUCHESS. Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</a>
<a id='line_266'>    Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</a>
<a id='line_267'>    Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</a>
<a id='line_268'>    Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</a>
<a id='line_269'>    Or seven fair branches springing from one root.</a>
<a id='line_270'>    Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,</a>
<a id='line_271'>    Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</a>
<a id='line_272'>    But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</a>
<a id='line_273'>    One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,</a>
<a id='line_274'>    One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</a>
<a id='line_275'>    Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;</a>
<a id='line_276'>    Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,</a>
<a id='line_277'>    By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.</a>
<a id='line_278'>    Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,</a>
<a id='line_279'>    That mettle, that self mould, that fashion'd thee,</a>
<a id='line_280'>    Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</a>
<a id='line_281'>    Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent</a>
<a id='line_282'>    In some large measure to thy father's death</a>
<a id='line_283'>    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</a>
<a id='line_284'>    Who was the model of thy father's life.</a>

<a id='line_286'>    In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red,</a>
<a id='line_287'>    Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</a>
<a id='line_288'>    Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.</a>
<a id='line_289'>    That which in mean men we entitle patience</a>
<a id='line_290'>    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</a>
<a id='line_291'>    What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life</a>
<a id='line_292'>    The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.</a>
<a id='line_293'>  GAUNT. God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,</a>
<a id='line_294'>    His deputy anointed in His sight,</a>

<a id='line_301'>    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</a>

<a id='line_609'>  GAUNT. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</a>
<a id='line_610'>  BOLINGBROKE. Joy absent, grief is present for that time.</a>
<a id='line_611'>  GAUNT. What is six winters? They are quickly gone.</a>

<a id='line_613'>  GAUNT. Call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_614'>  BOLINGBROKE. My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,</a>
<a id='line_615'>    Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.</a>
<a id='line_616'>  GAUNT. The sullen passage of thy weary steps</a>
<a id='line_617'>    Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set</a>
<a id='line_618'>    The precious jewel of thy home return.</a>
<a id='line_619'>  BOLINGBROKE. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make</a>

<a id='line_622'>    Must I not serve a long apprenticehood</a>
<a id='line_623'>    To foreign passages; and in the end,</a>
<a id='line_624'>    Having my freedom, boast of nothing else</a>

<a id='line_671'>  KING RICHARD. And say, what store of parting tears were shed?</a>

<a id='line_674'>    Awak'd the sleeping rheum, and so by chance</a>
<a id='line_675'>    Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</a>

<a id='line_677'>  AUMERLE. 'Farewell.'</a>
<a id='line_678'>    And, for my heart disdained that my tongue</a>

<a id='line_681'>    That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.</a>
<a id='line_682'>    Marry, would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours</a>

<a id='line_889'>    As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.</a>
<a id='line_890'>  KING RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;</a>
<a id='line_891'>    As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.</a>
<a id='line_892'></a>
<a id='line_893'>                Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</a>
<a id='line_894'></a>
<a id='line_895'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.</a>
<a id='line_896'>  KING RICHARD. What says he?</a>
<a id='line_897'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.</a>
<a id='line_898'>    His tongue is now a stringless instrument;</a>
<a id='line_899'>    Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.</a>
<a id='line_900'>  YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!</a>
<a id='line_901'>    Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.</a>
<a id='line_902'>  KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;</a>
<a id='line_903'>    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</a>
<a id='line_904'>    So much for that. Now for our Irish wars.</a>
<a id='line_905'>    We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,</a>
<a id='line_906'>    Which live like venom where no venom else</a>
<a id='line_907'>    But only they have privilege to live.</a>
<a id='line_908'>    And for these great affairs do ask some charge,</a>
<a id='line_909'>    Towards our assistance we do seize to us</a>
<a id='line_910'>    The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables,</a>
<a id='line_911'>    Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.</a>
<a id='line_912'>  YORK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long</a>
<a id='line_913'>    Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?</a>
<a id='line_914'>    Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,</a>
<a id='line_915'>    Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,</a>
<a id='line_916'>    Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke</a>
<a id='line_917'>    About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_918'>    Have ever made me sour my patient cheek</a>
<a id='line_919'>    Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.</a>
<a id='line_920'>    I am the last of noble Edward's sons,</a>
<a id='line_921'>    Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.</a>
<a id='line_922'>    In war was never lion rag'd more fierce,</a>
<a id='line_923'>    In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</a>
<a id='line_924'>    Than was that young and princely gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_925'>    His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,</a>
<a id='line_926'>    Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;</a>
<a id='line_927'>    But when he frown'd, it was against the French</a>
<a id='line_928'>    And not against his friends. His noble hand</a>
<a id='line_929'>    Did win what he did spend, and spent not that</a>
<a id='line_930'>    Which his triumphant father's hand had won.</a>
<a id='line_931'>    His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,</a>
<a id='line_932'>    But bloody with the enemies of his kin.</a>
<a id='line_933'>    O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,</a>
<a id='line_934'>    Or else he never would compare between-</a>
<a id='line_935'>  KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter?</a>
<a id='line_936'>  YORK. O my liege,</a>
<a id='line_937'>    Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas'd</a>
<a id='line_938'>    Not to be pardoned, am content withal.</a>
<a id='line_939'>    Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands</a>
<a id='line_940'>    The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?</a>
<a id='line_941'>    Is not Gaunt dead? and doth not Hereford live?</a>
<a id='line_942'>    Was not Gaunt just? and is not Harry true?</a>
<a id='line_943'>    Did not the one deserve to have an heir?</a>
<a id='line_944'>    Is not his heir a well-deserving son?</a>
<a id='line_945'>    Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time</a>
<a id='line_946'>    His charters and his customary rights;</a>
<a id='line_947'>    Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;</a>
<a id='line_948'>    Be not thyself-for how art thou a king</a>
<a id='line_949'>    But by fair sequence and succession?</a>
<a id='line_950'>    Now, afore God-God forbid I say true!-</a>
<a id='line_951'>    If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,</a>
<a id='line_952'>    Call in the letters patents that he hath</a>

<a id='line_957'>    And prick my tender patience to those thoughts</a>
<a id='line_958'>    Which honour and allegiance cannot think.</a>
<a id='line_959'>  KING RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands</a>
<a id='line_960'>    His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.</a>
<a id='line_961'>  YORK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.</a>
<a id='line_962'>    What will ensue hereof there's none can tell;</a>
<a id='line_963'>    But by bad courses may be understood</a>
<a id='line_964'>    That their events can never fall out good.              Exit</a>
<a id='line_965'>  KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;</a>
<a id='line_966'>    Bid him repair to us to Ely House</a>
<a id='line_967'>    To see this business. To-morrow next</a>
<a id='line_968'>    We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow.</a>
<a id='line_969'>    And we create, in absence of ourself,</a>
<a id='line_970'>    Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England;</a>
<a id='line_971'>    For he is just, and always lov'd us well.</a>
<a id='line_972'>    Come on, our queen; to-morrow must we part;</a>
<a id='line_973'>    Be merry, for our time of stay is short.</a>
<a id='line_974'>                   Flourish. Exeunt KING, QUEEN, BUSHY, AUMERLE,</a>
<a id='line_975'>                                                GREEN, and BAGOT</a>
<a id='line_976'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.</a>
<a id='line_977'>    Ross. And living too; for now his son is Duke.</a>
<a id='line_978'>  WILLOUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues.</a>
<a id='line_979'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.</a>
<a id='line_980'>  ROSS. My heart is great; but it must break with silence,</a>
<a id='line_981'>    Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.</a>
<a id='line_982'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more</a>
<a id='line_983'>    That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!</a>
<a id='line_984'>  WILLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?</a>
<a id='line_985'>    If it be so, out with it boldly, man;</a>
<a id='line_986'>    Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.</a>
<a id='line_987'>  ROSS. No good at all that I can do for him;</a>
<a id='line_988'>    Unless you call it good to pity him,</a>
<a id='line_989'>    Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.</a>
<a id='line_990'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne</a>
<a id='line_991'>    In him, a royal prince, and many moe</a>
<a id='line_992'>    Of noble blood in this declining land.</a>
<a id='line_993'>    The King is not himself, but basely led</a>
<a id='line_994'>    By flatterers; and what they will inform,</a>
<a id='line_995'>    Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us an,</a>
<a id='line_996'>    That will the King severely prosecute</a>
<a id='line_997'>    'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.</a>
<a id='line_998'>  ROSS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;</a>
<a id='line_999'>    And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find</a>
<a id='line_1000'>    For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  WILLOUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devis'd,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>    As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what;</a>
<a id='line_1003'>    But what, a God's name, doth become of this?</a>
<a id='line_1004'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>    But basely yielded upon compromise</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows.</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.</a>
<a id='line_1009'>  WILLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.</a>
<a id='line_1010'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  ROSS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke.</a>
<a id='line_1014'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;</a>
<a id='line_1017'>    We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>    And yet we strike not, but securely perish.</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    And unavoided is the danger now</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    For suffering so the causes of our wreck.</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death</a>
<a id='line_1023'>    I spy life peering; but I dare not say</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    How near the tidings of our comfort is.</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  WILLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  ROSS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland.</a>
<a id='line_1027'>    We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore be bold.</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    In Brittany, receiv'd intelligence</a>
<a id='line_1031'>    That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,</a>

<a id='line_1034'>    Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,</a>
<a id='line_1035'>    Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint-</a>
<a id='line_1036'>    All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,</a>
<a id='line_1038'>    Are making hither with all due expedience,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>    And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.</a>
<a id='line_1040'>    Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay</a>
<a id='line_1041'>    The first departing of the King for Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_1042'>    If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>    Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>    And make high majesty look like itself,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>    Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;</a>
<a id='line_1048'>    But if you faint, as fearing to do so,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    Stay and be secret, and myself will go.</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  ROSS. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  WILLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</a>
<a id='line_1052'>                                                          Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_1053'></a>
<a id='line_1054'>SCENE 2. Windsor Castle</a>
<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>  BUSHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.</a>
<a id='line_1059'>    You promis'd, when you parted with the King,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    To lay aside life-harming heaviness</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    And entertain a cheerful disposition.</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  QUEEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>    Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    With nothing trembles. At some thing it grieves</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    More than with parting from my lord the King.</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  BUSHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>    Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>    Divides one thing entire to many objects,</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon,</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    Show nothing but confusion-ey'd awry,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    Distinguish form. So your sweet Majesty,</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    Looking awry upon your lord's departure,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>    Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail;</a>
<a id='line_1080'>    Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious Queen,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    More than your lord's departure weep not-more is not seen;</a>
<a id='line_1083'>    Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>    Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  QUEEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe'er it be,</a>
<a id='line_1087'>    I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    As-though, on thinking, on no thought I think-</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  BUSHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  QUEEN. 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd</a>
<a id='line_1092'>    From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    For nothing hath begot my something grief,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    Or something hath the nothing that I grieve;</a>
<a id='line_1095'>    'Tis in reversion that I do possess-</a>
<a id='line_1096'>    But what it is that is not yet known what,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.</a>
<a id='line_1098'></a>
<a id='line_1099'>                   Enter GREEN</a>

<a id='line_1101'>  GREEN. God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  QUEEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;</a>
<a id='line_1104'>    For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.</a>
<a id='line_1105'>    Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  GREEN. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power</a>
<a id='line_1107'>    And driven into despair an enemy's hope</a>
<a id='line_1108'>    Who strongly hath set footing in this land.</a>
<a id='line_1109'>    The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,</a>
<a id='line_1110'>    And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd</a>
<a id='line_1111'>    At Ravenspurgh.</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  QUEEN. Now God in heaven forbid!</a>
<a id='line_1113'>  GREEN. Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,</a>
<a id='line_1114'>    The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,</a>
<a id='line_1115'>    The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,</a>
<a id='line_1116'>    With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  BUSHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_1118'>    And all the rest revolted faction traitors?</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  GREEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester</a>
<a id='line_1120'>    Hath broken his staff, resign'd his stewardship,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>    And all the household servants fled with him</a>
<a id='line_1122'>    To Bolingbroke.</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  QUEEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>    And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir.</a>
<a id='line_1125'>    Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy;</a>
<a id='line_1126'>    And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,</a>
<a id='line_1127'>    Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  BUSHY. Despair not, madam.</a>
<a id='line_1129'>  QUEEN. Who shall hinder me?</a>
<a id='line_1130'>    I will despair, and be at enmity</a>
<a id='line_1131'>    With cozening hope-he is a flatterer,</a>
<a id='line_1132'>    A parasite, a keeper-back of death,</a>
<a id='line_1133'>    Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,</a>
<a id='line_1134'>    Which false hope lingers in extremity.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>                    Enter YORK</a>
<a id='line_1137'></a>
<a id='line_1138'>  GREEN. Here comes the Duke of York.</a>
<a id='line_1139'>  QUEEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.</a>
<a id='line_1140'>    O, full of careful business are his looks!</a>
<a id='line_1141'>    Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.</a>
<a id='line_1142'>  YORK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_1143'>    Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,</a>

<a id='line_1489'>    Awhile to work, and after holiday.                    Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_1490'></a>
<a id='line_1491'>SCENE 2. The coast of Wales. A castle in view</a>
<a id='line_1492'></a>
<a id='line_1493'>Drums. Flourish and colours. Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,</a>
<a id='line_1494'>AUMERLE, and soldiers</a>
<a id='line_1495'></a>
<a id='line_1496'>  KING RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air</a>
<a id='line_1498'>    After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</a>
<a id='line_1499'>  KING RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy</a>
<a id='line_1500'>    To stand upon my kingdom once again.</a>
<a id='line_1501'>    Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</a>
<a id='line_1502'>    Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs.</a>
<a id='line_1503'>    As a long-parted mother with her child</a>
<a id='line_1504'>    Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</a>
<a id='line_1505'>    So weeping-smiling greet I thee, my earth,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>    And do thee favours with my royal hands.</a>
<a id='line_1507'>    Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,</a>
<a id='line_1508'>    Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;</a>
<a id='line_1509'>    But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</a>
<a id='line_1510'>    And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way,</a>
<a id='line_1511'>    Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet</a>

<a id='line_1513'>    Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</a>
<a id='line_1514'>    And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>    Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,</a>
<a id='line_1516'>    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</a>
<a id='line_1517'>    Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1518'>    Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.</a>
<a id='line_1519'>    This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones</a>
<a id='line_1520'>    Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</a>
<a id='line_1521'>    Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.</a>
<a id='line_1522'>  CARLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king</a>
<a id='line_1523'>    Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</a>
<a id='line_1524'>    The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd</a>
<a id='line_1525'>    And not neglected; else, if heaven would,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>    And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,</a>
<a id='line_1527'>    The proffered means of succour and redress.</a>
<a id='line_1528'>  AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;</a>
<a id='line_1529'>    Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,</a>
<a id='line_1530'>    Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  KING RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not</a>
<a id='line_1532'>    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,</a>
<a id='line_1533'>    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,</a>
<a id='line_1534'>    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</a>
<a id='line_1535'>    In murders and in outrage boldly here;</a>
<a id='line_1536'>    But when from under this terrestrial ball</a>
<a id='line_1537'>    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</a>
<a id='line_1538'>    And darts his light through every guilty hole,</a>
<a id='line_1539'>    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,</a>
<a id='line_1540'>    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,</a>
<a id='line_1541'>    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</a>
<a id='line_1542'>    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,</a>
<a id='line_1543'>    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,</a>
<a id='line_1544'>    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,</a>
<a id='line_1545'>    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</a>
<a id='line_1547'>    Not able to endure the sight of day,</a>
<a id='line_1548'>    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</a>
<a id='line_1549'>    Not all the water in the rough rude sea</a>
<a id='line_1550'>    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</a>
<a id='line_1551'>    The breath of worldly men cannot depose</a>
<a id='line_1552'>    The deputy elected by the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1553'>    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd</a>
<a id='line_1554'>    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,</a>
<a id='line_1555'>    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</a>
<a id='line_1556'>    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,</a>
<a id='line_1557'>    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.</a>
<a id='line_1558'></a>
<a id='line_1559'>                 Enter SALISBURY</a>
<a id='line_1560'></a>
<a id='line_1561'>    Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  SALISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</a>
<a id='line_1563'>    Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>    And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</a>
<a id='line_1565'>    One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_1566'>    Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.</a>
<a id='line_1567'>    O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</a>
<a id='line_1568'>    And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!</a>
<a id='line_1569'>    To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,</a>
<a id='line_1570'>    O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;</a>
<a id='line_1571'>    For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,</a>
<a id='line_1572'>    Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispers'd, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_1573'>  AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?</a>
<a id='line_1574'>  KING RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men</a>
<a id='line_1575'>    Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</a>
<a id='line_1576'>    And, till so much blood thither come again,</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</a>
<a id='line_1578'>    All souls that will be safe, fly from my side;</a>
<a id='line_1579'>    For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</a>
<a id='line_1580'>  AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.</a>
<a id='line_1581'>  KING RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King?</a>
<a id='line_1582'>    Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.</a>
<a id='line_1583'>    Is not the King's name twenty thousand names?</a>
<a id='line_1584'>    Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes</a>
<a id='line_1585'>    At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>    Ye favourites of a king; are we not high?</a>
<a id='line_1587'>    High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York</a>
<a id='line_1588'>    Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</a>
<a id='line_1589'></a>
<a id='line_1590'>                   Enter SCROOP</a>
<a id='line_1591'></a>
<a id='line_1592'>  SCROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege</a>
<a id='line_1593'>    Than can my care-tun'd tongue deliver him.</a>
<a id='line_1594'>  KING RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.</a>
<a id='line_1595'>    The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</a>
<a id='line_1596'>    Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, 'twas my care,</a>
<a id='line_1597'>    And what loss is it to be rid of care?</a>
<a id='line_1598'>    Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?</a>
<a id='line_1599'>    Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</a>
<a id='line_1600'>    We'll serve him too, and be his fellow so.</a>
<a id='line_1601'>    Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend;</a>
<a id='line_1602'>    They break their faith to God as well as us.</a>
<a id='line_1603'>    Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay-</a>
<a id='line_1604'>    The worst is death, and death will have his day.</a>
<a id='line_1605'>  SCROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd</a>
<a id='line_1606'>    To bear the tidings of calamity.</a>
<a id='line_1607'>    Like an unseasonable stormy day</a>
<a id='line_1608'>    Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,</a>
<a id='line_1609'>    As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears,</a>
<a id='line_1610'>    So high above his limits swells the rage</a>
<a id='line_1611'>    Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land</a>
<a id='line_1612'>    With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.</a>
<a id='line_1613'>    White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps</a>
<a id='line_1614'>    Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,</a>
<a id='line_1615'>    Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints</a>
<a id='line_1616'>    In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;</a>
<a id='line_1617'>    Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</a>
<a id='line_1618'>    Of double-fatal yew against thy state;</a>
<a id='line_1619'>    Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills</a>
<a id='line_1620'>    Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,</a>
<a id='line_1621'>    And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</a>
<a id='line_1622'>  KING RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?</a>
<a id='line_1624'>    What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?</a>
<a id='line_1625'>    That they have let the dangerous enemy</a>
<a id='line_1626'>    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?</a>
<a id='line_1627'>    If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.</a>
<a id='line_1628'>    I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.</a>
<a id='line_1629'>  SCROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_1630'>  KING RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!</a>
<a id='line_1631'>    Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</a>
<a id='line_1632'>    Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!</a>
<a id='line_1633'>    Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    Would they make peace? Terrible hell make war</a>
<a id='line_1635'>    Upon their spotted souls for this offence!</a>
<a id='line_1636'>  SCROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</a>
<a id='line_1637'>    Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.</a>
<a id='line_1638'>    Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made</a>
<a id='line_1639'>    With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse</a>
<a id='line_1640'>    Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound</a>
<a id='line_1641'>    And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.</a>
<a id='line_1642'>  AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</a>
<a id='line_1643'>  SCROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.</a>
<a id='line_1644'>  AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?</a>
<a id='line_1645'>  KING RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak.</a>
<a id='line_1646'>    Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;</a>
<a id='line_1647'>    Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes</a>
<a id='line_1648'>    Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1649'>    Let's choose executors and talk of wills;</a>
<a id='line_1650'>    And yet not so-for what can we bequeath</a>
<a id='line_1651'>    Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</a>
<a id='line_1652'>    Our lands, our lives, and an, are Bolingbroke's.</a>
<a id='line_1653'>    And nothing can we can our own but death</a>
<a id='line_1654'>    And that small model of the barren earth</a>
<a id='line_1655'>    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</a>
<a id='line_1656'>    For God's sake let us sit upon the ground</a>
<a id='line_1657'>    And tell sad stories of the death of kings:</a>
<a id='line_1658'>    How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,</a>
<a id='line_1659'>    Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,</a>
<a id='line_1660'>    Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>    All murder'd-for within the hollow crown</a>
<a id='line_1662'>    That rounds the mortal temples of a king</a>
<a id='line_1663'>    Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,</a>
<a id='line_1664'>    Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;</a>
<a id='line_1667'>    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</a>
<a id='line_1668'>    As if this flesh which walls about our life</a>
<a id='line_1669'>    Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus,</a>
<a id='line_1670'>    Comes at the last, and with a little pin</a>
<a id='line_1671'>    Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king!</a>
<a id='line_1672'>    Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood</a>
<a id='line_1673'>    With solemn reverence; throw away respect,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>    Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty;</a>
<a id='line_1675'>    For you have but mistook me all this while.</a>
<a id='line_1676'>    I live with bread like you, feel want,</a>
<a id='line_1677'>    Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,</a>
<a id='line_1678'>    How can you say to me I am a king?</a>
<a id='line_1679'>  CARLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,</a>
<a id='line_1680'>    But presently prevent the ways to wail.</a>
<a id='line_1681'>    To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>    Gives, in your weakness, strength unto your foe,</a>
<a id='line_1683'>    And so your follies fight against yourself.</a>
<a id='line_1684'>    Fear and be slain-no worse can come to fight;</a>
<a id='line_1685'>    And fight and die is death destroying death,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>    Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</a>
<a id='line_1687'>  AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,</a>
<a id='line_1688'>    And learn to make a body of a limb.</a>
<a id='line_1689'>  KING RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    To change blows with thee for our day of doom.</a>
<a id='line_1691'>    This ague fit of fear is over-blown;</a>
<a id='line_1692'>    An easy task it is to win our own.</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</a>
<a id='line_1695'>  SCROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky</a>
<a id='line_1696'>    The state in inclination of the day;</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    So may you by my dull and heavy eye,</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</a>
<a id='line_1699'>    I play the torturer, by small and small</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke;</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    And all your northern castles yielded up,</a>
<a id='line_1703'>    And all your southern gentlemen in arms</a>
<a id='line_1704'>    Upon his party.</a>
<a id='line_1705'>  KING RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      [To AUMERLE] Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</a>
<a id='line_1707'>    Of that sweet way I was in to despair!</a>
<a id='line_1708'>    What say you now? What comfort have we now?</a>
<a id='line_1709'>    By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly</a>
<a id='line_1710'>    That bids me be of comfort any more.</a>
<a id='line_1711'>    Go to Flint Castle; there I'll pine away;</a>
<a id='line_1712'>    A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.</a>
<a id='line_1713'>    That power I have, discharge; and let them go</a>

<a id='line_1717'>  AUMERLE. My liege, one word.</a>
<a id='line_1718'>  KING RICHARD. He does me double wrong</a>
<a id='line_1719'>    That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.</a>
<a id='line_1720'>    Discharge my followers; let them hence away,</a>

<a id='line_2876'>    Was it not so?</a>
<a id='line_2877'>  SERVANT. These were his very words.</a>
<a id='line_2878'>  EXTON. 'Have I no friend?' quoth he. He spake it twice</a>
<a id='line_2879'>    And urg'd it twice together, did he not?</a>
<a id='line_2880'>  SERVANT. He did.</a>
<a id='line_2881'>  EXTON. And, speaking it, he wishtly look'd on me,</a>

<a id='line_2889'>Enter KING RICHARD</a>
<a id='line_2890'></a>
<a id='line_2891'>  KING RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare</a>
<a id='line_2892'>    This prison where I live unto the world</a>
<a id='line_2893'>    And, for because the world is populous</a>
<a id='line_2894'>    And here is not a creature but myself,</a>
<a id='line_2895'>    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.</a>
<a id='line_2896'>    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</a>
<a id='line_2897'>    My soul the father; and these two beget</a>
<a id='line_2898'>    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_2899'>    And these same thoughts people this little world,</a>
<a id='line_2900'>    In humours like the people of this world,</a>
<a id='line_2901'>    For no thought is contented. The better sort,</a>
<a id='line_2902'>    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</a>
<a id='line_2903'>    With scruples, and do set the word itself</a>
<a id='line_2904'>    Against the word,</a>
<a id='line_2905'>    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,</a>
<a id='line_2906'>    'It is as hard to come as for a camel</a>
<a id='line_2907'>    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</a>
<a id='line_2908'>    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</a>
<a id='line_2909'>    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</a>
<a id='line_2910'>    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</a>
<a id='line_2911'>    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;</a>
<a id='line_2912'>    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</a>
<a id='line_2913'>    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</a>
<a id='line_2914'>    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</a>
<a id='line_2915'>    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</a>
<a id='line_2916'>    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,</a>
<a id='line_2917'>    That many have and others must sit there;</a>
<a id='line_2918'>    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</a>
<a id='line_2919'>    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</a>
<a id='line_2920'>    Of such as have before endur'd the like.</a>
<a id='line_2921'>    Thus play I in one person many people,</a>
<a id='line_2922'>    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;</a>
<a id='line_2923'>    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</a>
<a id='line_2924'>    And so I am. Then crushing penury</a>
<a id='line_2925'>    Persuades me I was better when a king;</a>
<a id='line_2926'>    Then am I king'd again; and by and by</a>
<a id='line_2927'>    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</a>
<a id='line_2928'>    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,</a>
<a id='line_2929'>    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,</a>
<a id='line_2930'>    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd</a>
<a id='line_2931'>    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]</a>
<a id='line_2932'>    Music do I hear?</a>
<a id='line_2933'>    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is</a>
<a id='line_2934'>    When time is broke and no proportion kept!</a>
<a id='line_2935'>    So is it in the music of men's lives.</a>
<a id='line_2936'>    And here have I the daintiness of ear</a>
<a id='line_2937'>    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;</a>
<a id='line_2938'>    But, for the concord of my state and time,</a>
<a id='line_2939'>    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</a>
<a id='line_2940'>    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</a>
<a id='line_2941'>    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:</a>
<a id='line_2942'>    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</a>
<a id='line_2943'>    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</a>
<a id='line_2945'>    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</a>
<a id='line_2946'>    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</a>
<a id='line_2947'>    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart,</a>
<a id='line_2948'>    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,</a>
<a id='line_2949'>    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time</a>
<a id='line_2950'>    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</a>
<a id='line_2951'>    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.</a>
<a id='line_2952'>    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;</a>
<a id='line_2953'>    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</a>
<a id='line_2955'>    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</a>
<a id='line_2956'>    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</a>

<a id='line_2963'>    The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.</a>
<a id='line_2964'>    What art thou? and how comest thou hither,</a>
<a id='line_2965'>    Where no man never comes but that sad dog</a>
<a id='line_2966'>    That brings me food to make misfortune live?</a>
<a id='line_2967'>  GROOM. I was a poor groom of thy stable, King,</a>
<a id='line_2968'>    When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,</a>
<a id='line_2969'>    With much ado at length have gotten leave</a>
<a id='line_2970'>    To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.</a>
<a id='line_2971'>    O, how it ern'd my heart, when I beheld,</a>
<a id='line_2972'>    In London streets, that coronation-day,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>    When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary-</a>
<a id='line_2974'>    That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,</a>
<a id='line_2975'>    That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!</a>
<a id='line_2976'>  KING RICHARD. Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,</a>
<a id='line_2977'>    How went he under him?</a>
<a id='line_2978'>  GROOM. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.</a>
<a id='line_2979'>  KING RICHARD. So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!</a>
<a id='line_2980'>    That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;</a>
<a id='line_2981'>    This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</a>
<a id='line_2982'>    Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,</a>
<a id='line_2983'>    Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</a>
<a id='line_2984'>    Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</a>
<a id='line_2985'>    Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,</a>
<a id='line_2986'>    Since thou, created to be aw'd by man,</a>
<a id='line_2987'>    Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;</a>
<a id='line_2988'>    And yet I bear a burden like an ass,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>    Spurr'd, gall'd, and tir'd, by jauncing Bolingbroke.</a>

<a id='line_2999'>  KEEPER. My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>    Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary.</a>
