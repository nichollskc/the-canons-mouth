                    <a id='line_0'>The First Book of the Kings</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>Commonly Called:</a>
<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>The Third Book of the Kings</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered</a>
<a id='line_8'>him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my</a>
<a id='line_11'>lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and</a>
<a id='line_12'>let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the</a>
<a id='line_13'>king may get heat.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of</a>
<a id='line_16'>Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and</a>
<a id='line_19'>ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will</a>
<a id='line_22'>be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to</a>
<a id='line_23'>run before him.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why</a>
<a id='line_26'>hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother</a>
<a id='line_27'>bare him after Absalom.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar</a>
<a id='line_30'>the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan</a>
<a id='line_33'>the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to</a>
<a id='line_34'>David, were not with Adonijah.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of</a>
<a id='line_37'>Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king’s</a>
<a id='line_38'>sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants: 1:10 But Nathan</a>
<a id='line_39'>the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother,</a>
<a id='line_40'>he called not.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_43'>saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth</a>
<a id='line_44'>reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?  1:12 Now therefore come,</a>
<a id='line_45'>let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine</a>
<a id='line_46'>own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not</a>
<a id='line_49'>thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly</a>
<a id='line_50'>Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</a>
<a id='line_51'>why then doth Adonijah reign?  1:14 Behold, while thou yet talkest</a>
<a id='line_52'>there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy</a>
<a id='line_53'>words.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the</a>
<a id='line_56'>king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the</a>
<a id='line_57'>king.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the</a>
<a id='line_60'>king said, What wouldest thou?  1:17 And she said unto him, My lord,</a>
<a id='line_61'>thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying,</a>
<a id='line_62'>Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon</a>
<a id='line_63'>my throne.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>1:18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,</a>
<a id='line_66'>thou knowest it not: 1:19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and</a>
<a id='line_67'>sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and</a>
<a id='line_68'>Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy</a>
<a id='line_69'>servant hath he not called.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,</a>
<a id='line_72'>that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord</a>
<a id='line_73'>the king after him.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>1:21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall</a>
<a id='line_76'>sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted</a>
<a id='line_77'>offenders.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet</a>
<a id='line_80'>also came in.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>1:23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And</a>
<a id='line_83'>when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king</a>
<a id='line_84'>with his face to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall</a>
<a id='line_87'>reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  1:25 For he is gone</a>
<a id='line_88'>down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in</a>
<a id='line_89'>abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of</a>
<a id='line_90'>the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink</a>
<a id='line_91'>before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>1:26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah</a>
<a id='line_94'>the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>1:27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed</a>
<a id='line_97'>it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king</a>
<a id='line_98'>after him?  1:28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba.</a>
<a id='line_99'>And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath</a>
<a id='line_102'>redeemed my soul out of all distress, 1:30 Even as I sware unto thee</a>
<a id='line_103'>by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall</a>
<a id='line_104'>reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so</a>
<a id='line_105'>will I certainly do this day.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did</a>
<a id='line_108'>reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>1:32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the</a>
<a id='line_111'>prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the</a>
<a id='line_112'>king.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>1:33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your</a>
<a id='line_115'>lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring</a>
<a id='line_116'>him down to Gihon: 1:34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the</a>
<a id='line_117'>prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the</a>
<a id='line_118'>trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>1:35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my</a>
<a id='line_121'>throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to</a>
<a id='line_122'>be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,</a>
<a id='line_125'>Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>1:37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with</a>
<a id='line_128'>Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king</a>
<a id='line_129'>David.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>1:38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son</a>
<a id='line_132'>of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and</a>
<a id='line_133'>caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to</a>
<a id='line_134'>Gihon.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>1:39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,</a>
<a id='line_137'>and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people</a>
<a id='line_138'>said, God save king Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>1:40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with</a>
<a id='line_141'>pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the</a>
<a id='line_142'>sound of them.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as</a>
<a id='line_145'>they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_146'>trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an</a>
<a id='line_147'>uproar?  1:42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of</a>
<a id='line_148'>Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for</a>
<a id='line_149'>thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>1:43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king</a>
<a id='line_152'>David hath made Solomon king.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>1:44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the</a>
<a id='line_155'>prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the</a>
<a id='line_156'>Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:</a>
<a id='line_157'>1:45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him</a>
<a id='line_158'>king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the</a>
<a id='line_159'>city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>1:46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>1:47 And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king</a>
<a id='line_164'>David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and</a>
<a id='line_165'>make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself</a>
<a id='line_166'>upon the bed.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>1:48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_169'>which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even</a>
<a id='line_170'>seeing it.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>1:49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose</a>
<a id='line_173'>up, and went every man his way.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>1:50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and</a>
<a id='line_176'>caught hold on the horns of the altar.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>1:51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king</a>
<a id='line_179'>Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,</a>
<a id='line_180'>saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his</a>
<a id='line_181'>servant with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there</a>
<a id='line_184'>shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be</a>
<a id='line_185'>found in him, he shall die.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>1:53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.</a>
<a id='line_188'>And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto</a>
<a id='line_189'>him, Go to thine house.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>2:1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged</a>
<a id='line_192'>Solomon his son, saying, 2:2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou</a>
<a id='line_193'>strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 2:3 And keep the charge of</a>
<a id='line_194'>the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his</a>
<a id='line_195'>commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written</a>
<a id='line_196'>in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest,</a>
<a id='line_197'>and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 2:4 That the LORD may continue</a>
<a id='line_198'>his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take</a>
<a id='line_199'>heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and</a>
<a id='line_200'>with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the</a>
<a id='line_201'>throne of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,</a>
<a id='line_204'>and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner</a>
<a id='line_205'>the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and</a>
<a id='line_206'>shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his</a>
<a id='line_207'>girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his</a>
<a id='line_208'>feet.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>2:6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go</a>
<a id='line_211'>down to the grave in peace.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and</a>
<a id='line_214'>let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me</a>
<a id='line_215'>when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>2:8 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a</a>
<a id='line_218'>Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day</a>
<a id='line_219'>when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I</a>
<a id='line_220'>sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with</a>
<a id='line_221'>the sword.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and</a>
<a id='line_224'>knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring</a>
<a id='line_225'>thou down to the grave with blood.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of</a>
<a id='line_228'>David.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:</a>
<a id='line_231'>seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned</a>
<a id='line_232'>he in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his</a>
<a id='line_235'>kingdom was established greatly.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of</a>
<a id='line_238'>Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,</a>
<a id='line_241'>Say on.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all</a>
<a id='line_244'>Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_245'>is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the</a>
<a id='line_246'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said</a>
<a id='line_249'>unto him, Say on.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he</a>
<a id='line_252'>will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to</a>
<a id='line_253'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>2:19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for</a>
<a id='line_258'>Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto</a>
<a id='line_259'>her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the</a>
<a id='line_260'>king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_263'>say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I</a>
<a id='line_264'>will not say thee nay.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy</a>
<a id='line_267'>brother to wife.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>2:22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost</a>
<a id='line_270'>thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_271'>also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the</a>
<a id='line_272'>priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and</a>
<a id='line_275'>more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>2:24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and</a>
<a id='line_278'>set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an</a>
<a id='line_279'>house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;</a>
<a id='line_282'>and he fell upon him that he died.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>2:26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,</a>
<a id='line_285'>unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at</a>
<a id='line_286'>this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_287'>God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in</a>
<a id='line_288'>all wherein my father was afflicted.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_291'>that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning</a>
<a id='line_292'>the house of Eli in Shiloh.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,</a>
<a id='line_295'>though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle</a>
<a id='line_296'>of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the</a>
<a id='line_299'>tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon</a>
<a id='line_300'>sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_303'>him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die</a>
<a id='line_304'>here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,</a>
<a id='line_305'>and thus he answered me.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon</a>
<a id='line_308'>him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood,</a>
<a id='line_309'>which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>2:32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell</a>
<a id='line_312'>upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the</a>
<a id='line_313'>sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of</a>
<a id='line_314'>Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,</a>
<a id='line_315'>captain of the host of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>2:33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and</a>
<a id='line_318'>upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed,</a>
<a id='line_319'>and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever</a>
<a id='line_320'>from the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_321'></a>
<a id='line_322'>2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_323'>slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the</a>
<a id='line_326'>host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>2:36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build</a>
<a id='line_329'>thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence</a>
<a id='line_330'>any whither.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>2:37 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over</a>
<a id='line_333'>the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely</a>
<a id='line_334'>die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the</a>
<a id='line_337'>king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_338'>many days.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>2:39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the</a>
<a id='line_341'>servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.</a>
<a id='line_342'>And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish</a>
<a id='line_345'>to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from</a>
<a id='line_346'>Gath.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to</a>
<a id='line_349'>Gath, and was come again.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>2:42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I</a>
<a id='line_352'>not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,</a>
<a id='line_353'>Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any</a>
<a id='line_354'>whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word</a>
<a id='line_355'>that I have heard is good.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the</a>
<a id='line_358'>commandment that I have charged thee with?  2:44 The king said</a>
<a id='line_359'>moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart</a>
<a id='line_360'>is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD</a>
<a id='line_361'>shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 2:45 And king Solomon</a>
<a id='line_362'>shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before</a>
<a id='line_363'>the LORD for ever.</a>
<a id='line_364'></a>
<a id='line_365'>2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went</a>
<a id='line_366'>out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established</a>
<a id='line_367'>in the hand of Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>3:1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took</a>
<a id='line_370'>Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he</a>
<a id='line_371'>had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_372'>and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>3:2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no</a>
<a id='line_375'>house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>3:3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his</a>
<a id='line_378'>father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the</a>
<a id='line_381'>great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon</a>
<a id='line_382'>that altar.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and</a>
<a id='line_385'>God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>3:6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my</a>
<a id='line_388'>father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and</a>
<a id='line_389'>in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast</a>
<a id='line_390'>kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to</a>
<a id='line_391'>sit on his throne, as it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of</a>
<a id='line_394'>David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out</a>
<a id='line_395'>or come in.</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>3:8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_398'>chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for</a>
<a id='line_399'>multitude.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>3:9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy</a>
<a id='line_402'>people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to</a>
<a id='line_403'>judge this thy so great a people?  3:10 And the speech pleased the</a>
<a id='line_404'>LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and</a>
<a id='line_407'>hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for</a>
<a id='line_408'>thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for</a>
<a id='line_409'>thyself understanding to discern judgment; 3:12 Behold, I have done</a>
<a id='line_410'>according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an</a>
<a id='line_411'>understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,</a>
<a id='line_412'>neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>3:13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both</a>
<a id='line_415'>riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings</a>
<a id='line_416'>like unto thee all thy days.</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my</a>
<a id='line_419'>commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy</a>
<a id='line_420'>days.</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>3:15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to</a>
<a id='line_423'>Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_424'>offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a</a>
<a id='line_425'>feast to all his servants.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>3:16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and</a>
<a id='line_428'>stood before him.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>3:17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one</a>
<a id='line_431'>house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</a>
<a id='line_432'></a>
<a id='line_433'>3:18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,</a>
<a id='line_434'>that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no</a>
<a id='line_435'>stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>3:19 And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid</a>
<a id='line_438'>it.</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>3:20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while</a>
<a id='line_441'>thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead</a>
<a id='line_442'>child in my bosom.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it</a>
<a id='line_445'>was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was</a>
<a id='line_446'>not my son, which I did bear.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>3:22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the</a>
<a id='line_449'>dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the</a>
<a id='line_450'>living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>3:23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,</a>
<a id='line_453'>and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the</a>
<a id='line_454'>dead, and my son is the living.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>3:24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword</a>
<a id='line_457'>before the king.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>3:25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half</a>
<a id='line_460'>to the one, and half to the other.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>3:26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,</a>
<a id='line_463'>for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her</a>
<a id='line_464'>the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it</a>
<a id='line_465'>be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</a>
<a id='line_466'></a>
<a id='line_467'>3:27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and</a>
<a id='line_468'>in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>3:28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;</a>
<a id='line_471'>and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in</a>
<a id='line_472'>him, to do judgment.</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>4:1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>4:2 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok</a>
<a id='line_477'>the priest, 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;</a>
<a id='line_478'>Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and</a>
<a id='line_481'>Abiathar were the priests: 4:5 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over</a>
<a id='line_482'>the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and</a>
<a id='line_483'>the king’s friend: 4:6 And Ahishar was over the household: and</a>
<a id='line_484'>Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided</a>
<a id='line_487'>victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year</a>
<a id='line_488'>made provision.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>4:8 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9</a>
<a id='line_491'>The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and</a>
<a id='line_492'>Elonbethhanan: 4:10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained</a>
<a id='line_493'>Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 4:11 The son of Abinadab, in all</a>
<a id='line_494'>the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</a>
<a id='line_495'>4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,</a>
<a id='line_496'>and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from</a>
<a id='line_497'>Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:</a>
<a id='line_498'>4:13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of</a>
<a id='line_499'>Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained</a>
<a id='line_500'>the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with</a>
<a id='line_501'>walls and brasen bars: 4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:</a>
<a id='line_502'>4:15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_503'>Solomon to wife: 4:16 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in</a>
<a id='line_504'>Aloth: 4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 4:18 Shimei</a>
<a id='line_505'>the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 4:19 Geber the son of Uri was in the</a>
<a id='line_506'>country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and</a>
<a id='line_507'>of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the</a>
<a id='line_508'>land.</a>
<a id='line_509'></a>
<a id='line_510'>4:20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in</a>
<a id='line_511'>multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the</a>
<a id='line_514'>land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought</a>
<a id='line_515'>presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>4:22 And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine</a>
<a id='line_518'>flour, and threescore measures of meal, 4:23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty</a>
<a id='line_519'>oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and</a>
<a id='line_520'>roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,</a>
<a id='line_523'>from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:</a>
<a id='line_524'>and he had peace on all sides round about him.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and</a>
<a id='line_527'>under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of</a>
<a id='line_528'>Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,</a>
<a id='line_531'>and twelve thousand horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>4:27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all</a>
<a id='line_534'>that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they</a>
<a id='line_535'>lacked nothing.</a>
<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they</a>
<a id='line_538'>unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his</a>
<a id='line_539'>charge.</a>
<a id='line_540'></a>
<a id='line_541'>4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and</a>
<a id='line_542'>largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>4:30 And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of</a>
<a id='line_545'>the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and</a>
<a id='line_548'>Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in</a>
<a id='line_549'>all nations round about.</a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'>4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a</a>
<a id='line_552'>thousand and five.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon</a>
<a id='line_555'>even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of</a>
<a id='line_556'>beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from</a>
<a id='line_559'>all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had</a>
<a id='line_562'>heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for</a>
<a id='line_563'>Hiram was ever a lover of David.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3 Thou knowest how that David</a>
<a id='line_566'>my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God</a>
<a id='line_567'>for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put</a>
<a id='line_568'>them under the soles of his feet.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that</a>
<a id='line_571'>there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>5:5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_574'>my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom</a>
<a id='line_575'>I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto</a>
<a id='line_576'>my name.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>5:6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of</a>
<a id='line_579'>Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee</a>
<a id='line_580'>will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_581'>appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can</a>
<a id='line_582'>skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that</a>
<a id='line_585'>he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which</a>
<a id='line_586'>hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</a>
<a id='line_587'></a>
<a id='line_588'>5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things</a>
<a id='line_589'>which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning</a>
<a id='line_590'>timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I</a>
<a id='line_593'>will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_594'>appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_595'>receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for</a>
<a id='line_596'>my household.</a>
<a id='line_597'></a>
<a id='line_598'>5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all</a>
<a id='line_599'>his desire.</a>
<a id='line_600'></a>
<a id='line_601'>5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food</a>
<a id='line_602'>to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon</a>
<a id='line_603'>to Hiram year by year.</a>
<a id='line_604'></a>
<a id='line_605'>5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there</a>
<a id='line_606'>was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league</a>
<a id='line_607'>together.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy</a>
<a id='line_610'>was thirty thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_611'></a>
<a id='line_612'>5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a</a>
<a id='line_613'>month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was</a>
<a id='line_614'>over the levy.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>5:15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,</a>
<a id='line_617'>and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 5:16 Beside the chief</a>
<a id='line_618'>of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three thousand and</a>
<a id='line_619'>three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>5:17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly</a>
<a id='line_622'>stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>5:18 And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the</a>
<a id='line_625'>stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>6:1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after</a>
<a id='line_628'>the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the</a>
<a id='line_629'>fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is</a>
<a id='line_630'>the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>6:2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length</a>
<a id='line_633'>thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,</a>
<a id='line_634'>and the height thereof thirty cubits.</a>
<a id='line_635'></a>
<a id='line_636'>6:3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was</a>
<a id='line_637'>the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten</a>
<a id='line_638'>cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>6:4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>6:5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,</a>
<a id='line_643'>against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of</a>
<a id='line_644'>the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 6:6 The nethermost</a>
<a id='line_645'>chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad,</a>
<a id='line_646'>and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the</a>
<a id='line_647'>house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be</a>
<a id='line_648'>fastened in the walls of the house.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>6:7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made</a>
<a id='line_651'>ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer</a>
<a id='line_652'>nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in</a>
<a id='line_653'>building.</a>
<a id='line_654'></a>
<a id='line_655'>6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the</a>
<a id='line_656'>house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,</a>
<a id='line_657'>and out of the middle into the third.</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with</a>
<a id='line_660'>beams and boards of cedar.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>6:10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits</a>
<a id='line_663'>high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 6:12 Concerning</a>
<a id='line_666'>this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my</a>
<a id='line_667'>statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to</a>
<a id='line_668'>walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake</a>
<a id='line_669'>unto David thy father: 6:13 And I will dwell among the children of</a>
<a id='line_670'>Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</a>
<a id='line_673'></a>
<a id='line_674'>6:15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,</a>
<a id='line_675'>both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he</a>
<a id='line_676'>covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the</a>
<a id='line_677'>house with planks of fir.</a>
<a id='line_678'></a>
<a id='line_679'>6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the</a>
<a id='line_680'>floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it</a>
<a id='line_681'>within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>6:17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits</a>
<a id='line_684'>long.</a>
<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>6:18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open</a>
<a id='line_687'>flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</a>
<a id='line_688'></a>
<a id='line_689'>6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the</a>
<a id='line_690'>ark of the covenant of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and</a>
<a id='line_693'>twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and</a>
<a id='line_694'>he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of</a>
<a id='line_695'>cedar.</a>
<a id='line_696'></a>
<a id='line_697'>6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made</a>
<a id='line_698'>a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid</a>
<a id='line_699'>it with gold.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished</a>
<a id='line_702'>all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid</a>
<a id='line_703'>with gold.</a>
<a id='line_704'></a>
<a id='line_705'>6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each</a>
<a id='line_706'>ten cubits high.</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits</a>
<a id='line_709'>the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing</a>
<a id='line_710'>unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of</a>
<a id='line_713'>one measure and one size.</a>
<a id='line_714'></a>
<a id='line_715'>6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the</a>
<a id='line_716'>other cherub.</a>
<a id='line_717'></a>
<a id='line_718'>6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they</a>
<a id='line_719'>stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the</a>
<a id='line_720'>one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the</a>
<a id='line_721'>other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_722'>house.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved</a>
<a id='line_727'>figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and</a>
<a id='line_728'>without.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>6:30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and</a>
<a id='line_731'>without.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:</a>
<a id='line_734'>the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them</a>
<a id='line_737'>carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid</a>
<a id='line_738'>them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm</a>
<a id='line_739'>trees.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a</a>
<a id='line_742'>fourth part of the wall.</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one</a>
<a id='line_745'>door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</a>
<a id='line_746'></a>
<a id='line_747'>6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:</a>
<a id='line_748'>and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</a>
<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and</a>
<a id='line_751'>a row of cedar beams.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>6:37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_754'>laid, in the month Zif: 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month</a>
<a id='line_755'>Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all</a>
<a id='line_756'>the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he</a>
<a id='line_757'>seven years in building it.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>7:1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he</a>
<a id='line_760'>finished all his house.</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>7:2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length</a>
<a id='line_763'>thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,</a>
<a id='line_764'>and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,</a>
<a id='line_765'>with cedar beams upon the pillars.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>7:3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on</a>
<a id='line_768'>forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>7:4 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light</a>
<a id='line_771'>in three ranks.</a>
<a id='line_772'></a>
<a id='line_773'>7:5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and</a>
<a id='line_774'>light was against light in three ranks.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>7:6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty</a>
<a id='line_777'>cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was</a>
<a id='line_778'>before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before</a>
<a id='line_779'>them.</a>
<a id='line_780'></a>
<a id='line_781'>7:7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the</a>
<a id='line_782'>porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the</a>
<a id='line_783'>floor to the other.</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>7:8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,</a>
<a id='line_786'>which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s</a>
<a id='line_787'>daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>7:9 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of</a>
<a id='line_790'>hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the</a>
<a id='line_791'>foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great</a>
<a id='line_792'>court.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>7:10 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,</a>
<a id='line_795'>stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>7:11 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,</a>
<a id='line_798'>and cedars.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>7:12 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed</a>
<a id='line_801'>stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the</a>
<a id='line_802'>house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>7:13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>7:14 He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was</a>
<a id='line_807'>a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_808'>understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to</a>
<a id='line_809'>king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</a>
<a id='line_810'></a>
<a id='line_811'>7:15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:</a>
<a id='line_812'>and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>7:16 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops</a>
<a id='line_815'>of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and</a>
<a id='line_816'>the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 7:17 And nets of</a>
<a id='line_817'>checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were</a>
<a id='line_818'>upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for</a>
<a id='line_819'>the other chapiter.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>7:18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one</a>
<a id='line_822'>network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with</a>
<a id='line_823'>pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.</a>
<a id='line_824'></a>
<a id='line_825'>7:19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of</a>
<a id='line_826'>lily work in the porch, four cubits.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also</a>
<a id='line_829'>above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the</a>
<a id='line_830'>pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other</a>
<a id='line_831'>chapiter.</a>
<a id='line_832'></a>
<a id='line_833'>7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set</a>
<a id='line_834'>up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up</a>
<a id='line_835'>the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</a>
<a id='line_836'></a>
<a id='line_837'>7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of</a>
<a id='line_838'>the pillars finished.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>7:23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the</a>
<a id='line_841'>other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a</a>
<a id='line_842'>line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</a>
<a id='line_843'></a>
<a id='line_844'>7:24 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing</a>
<a id='line_845'>it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were</a>
<a id='line_846'>cast in two rows, when it was cast.</a>
<a id='line_847'></a>
<a id='line_848'>7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and</a>
<a id='line_849'>three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and</a>
<a id='line_850'>three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,</a>
<a id='line_851'>and all their hinder parts were inward.</a>
<a id='line_852'></a>
<a id='line_853'>7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was</a>
<a id='line_854'>wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained</a>
<a id='line_855'>two thousand baths.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one</a>
<a id='line_858'>base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height</a>
<a id='line_859'>of it.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,</a>
<a id='line_862'>and the borders were between the ledges: 7:29 And on the borders that</a>
<a id='line_863'>were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the</a>
<a id='line_864'>ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were</a>
<a id='line_865'>certain additions made of thin work.</a>
<a id='line_866'></a>
<a id='line_867'>7:30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and</a>
<a id='line_868'>the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were</a>
<a id='line_869'>undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</a>
<a id='line_870'></a>
<a id='line_871'>7:31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:</a>
<a id='line_872'>but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit</a>
<a id='line_873'>and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their</a>
<a id='line_874'>borders, foursquare, not round.</a>
<a id='line_875'></a>
<a id='line_876'>7:32 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the</a>
<a id='line_877'>wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit</a>
<a id='line_878'>and half a cubit.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>7:33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:</a>
<a id='line_881'>their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,</a>
<a id='line_882'>were all molten.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>7:34 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:</a>
<a id='line_885'>and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>7:35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a</a>
<a id='line_888'>cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the</a>
<a id='line_889'>borders thereof were of the same.</a>
<a id='line_890'></a>
<a id='line_891'>7:36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders</a>
<a id='line_892'>thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the</a>
<a id='line_893'>proportion of every one, and additions round about.</a>
<a id='line_894'></a>
<a id='line_895'>7:37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one</a>
<a id='line_896'>casting, one measure, and one size.</a>
<a id='line_897'></a>
<a id='line_898'>7:38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty</a>
<a id='line_899'>baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten</a>
<a id='line_900'>bases one laver.</a>
<a id='line_901'></a>
<a id='line_902'>7:39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on</a>
<a id='line_903'>the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of</a>
<a id='line_904'>the house eastward over against the south.</a>
<a id='line_905'></a>
<a id='line_906'>7:40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So</a>
<a id='line_907'>Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for</a>
<a id='line_908'>the house of the LORD: 7:41 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the</a>
<a id='line_909'>chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two</a>
<a id='line_910'>networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the</a>
<a id='line_911'>top of the pillars; 7:42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two</a>
<a id='line_912'>networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the</a>
<a id='line_913'>two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 7:43 And the</a>
<a id='line_914'>ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 7:44 And one sea, and twelve</a>
<a id='line_915'>oxen under the sea; 7:45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the</a>
<a id='line_916'>basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for</a>
<a id='line_917'>the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</a>
<a id='line_918'></a>
<a id='line_919'>7:46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground</a>
<a id='line_920'>between Succoth and Zarthan.</a>
<a id='line_921'></a>
<a id='line_922'>7:47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were</a>
<a id='line_923'>exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</a>
<a id='line_924'></a>
<a id='line_925'>7:48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of</a>
<a id='line_926'>the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the</a>
<a id='line_927'>shewbread was, 7:49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the</a>
<a id='line_928'>right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers,</a>
<a id='line_929'>and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 7:50 And the bowls, and the</a>
<a id='line_930'>snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure</a>
<a id='line_931'>gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house,</a>
<a id='line_932'>the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the</a>
<a id='line_933'>temple.</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>7:51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of</a>
<a id='line_936'>the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had</a>
<a id='line_937'>dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put</a>
<a id='line_938'>among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_939'></a>
<a id='line_940'>8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of</a>
<a id='line_941'>the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto</a>
<a id='line_942'>king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_943'>covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>8:2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon</a>
<a id='line_946'>at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the</a>
<a id='line_949'>ark.</a>
<a id='line_950'></a>
<a id='line_951'>8:4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_952'>congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,</a>
<a id='line_953'>even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>8:5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were</a>
<a id='line_956'>assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep</a>
<a id='line_957'>and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</a>
<a id='line_958'></a>
<a id='line_959'>8:6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_960'>unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,</a>
<a id='line_961'>even under the wings of the cherubims.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>8:7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of</a>
<a id='line_964'>the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof</a>
<a id='line_965'>above.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>8:8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were</a>
<a id='line_968'>seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen</a>
<a id='line_969'>without: and there they are unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_970'></a>
<a id='line_971'>8:9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which</a>
<a id='line_972'>Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the</a>
<a id='line_973'>children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_974'></a>
<a id='line_975'>8:10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy</a>
<a id='line_976'>place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 8:11 So that the</a>
<a id='line_977'>priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the</a>
<a id='line_978'>glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_979'></a>
<a id='line_980'>8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the</a>
<a id='line_981'>thick darkness.</a>
<a id='line_982'></a>
<a id='line_983'>8:13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place</a>
<a id='line_984'>for thee to abide in for ever.</a>
<a id='line_985'></a>
<a id='line_986'>8:14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the</a>
<a id='line_987'>congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</a>
<a id='line_988'>8:15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with</a>
<a id='line_989'>his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,</a>
<a id='line_990'>saying, 8:16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out</a>
<a id='line_991'>of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an</a>
<a id='line_992'>house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my</a>
<a id='line_993'>people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_994'></a>
<a id='line_995'>8:17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for</a>
<a id='line_996'>the name of the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_997'></a>
<a id='line_998'>8:18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine</a>
<a id='line_999'>heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in</a>
<a id='line_1000'>thine heart.</a>
<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>8:19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that</a>
<a id='line_1003'>shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my</a>
<a id='line_1004'>name.</a>
<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>8:20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am</a>
<a id='line_1007'>risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of</a>
<a id='line_1008'>Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of</a>
<a id='line_1009'>the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1010'></a>
<a id='line_1011'>8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant</a>
<a id='line_1012'>of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out</a>
<a id='line_1013'>of the land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>8:22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of</a>
<a id='line_1016'>all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward</a>
<a id='line_1017'>heaven: 8:23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like</a>
<a id='line_1018'>thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and</a>
<a id='line_1019'>mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:</a>
<a id='line_1020'>8:24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou</a>
<a id='line_1021'>promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled</a>
<a id='line_1022'>it with thine hand, as it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_1023'></a>
<a id='line_1024'>8:25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my</a>
<a id='line_1025'>father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a</a>
<a id='line_1026'>man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children</a>
<a id='line_1027'>take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked</a>
<a id='line_1028'>before me.</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>8:26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</a>
<a id='line_1032'></a>
<a id='line_1033'>8:27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and</a>
<a id='line_1034'>heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I</a>
<a id='line_1035'>have builded?  8:28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy</a>
<a id='line_1036'>servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the</a>
<a id='line_1037'>cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:</a>
<a id='line_1038'>8:29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even</a>
<a id='line_1039'>toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that</a>
<a id='line_1040'>thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make</a>
<a id='line_1041'>toward this place.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>8:30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy</a>
<a id='line_1044'>people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou</a>
<a id='line_1045'>in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>8:31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid</a>
<a id='line_1048'>upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar</a>
<a id='line_1049'>in this house: 8:32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy</a>
<a id='line_1050'>servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and</a>
<a id='line_1051'>justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>8:33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because</a>
<a id='line_1054'>they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and</a>
<a id='line_1055'>confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this</a>
<a id='line_1056'>house: 8:34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy</a>
<a id='line_1057'>people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest</a>
<a id='line_1058'>unto their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>8:35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have</a>
<a id='line_1061'>sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy</a>
<a id='line_1062'>name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 8:36 Then</a>
<a id='line_1063'>hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy</a>
<a id='line_1064'>people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should</a>
<a id='line_1065'>walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people</a>
<a id='line_1066'>for an inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>8:37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,</a>

<a id='line_1071'>sickness there be; 8:38 What prayer and supplication soever be made by</a>
<a id='line_1072'>any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the</a>
<a id='line_1073'>plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:</a>
<a id='line_1074'>8:39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,</a>

<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>8:41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,</a>
<a id='line_1081'>but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake; 8:42 (For they</a>
<a id='line_1082'>shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy</a>
<a id='line_1083'>stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;</a>
<a id='line_1084'>8:43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all</a>
<a id='line_1085'>that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth</a>

<a id='line_1087'>they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy</a>

<a id='line_1090'>8:44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever</a>

<a id='line_1093'>name: 8:45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their</a>

<a id='line_1095'></a>
<a id='line_1096'>8:46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)</a>

<a id='line_1099'>8:47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they</a>

<a id='line_1101'>the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 8:48 And so</a>
<a id='line_1103'>return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the</a>
<a id='line_1104'>land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee</a>
<a id='line_1105'>toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city</a>
<a id='line_1106'>which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:</a>
<a id='line_1107'>8:49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy</a>
<a id='line_1108'>dwelling place, and maintain their cause, 8:50 And forgive thy people</a>
<a id='line_1109'>that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein</a>
<a id='line_1110'>they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before</a>
<a id='line_1111'>them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:</a>
<a id='line_1112'>8:51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou</a>
<a id='line_1113'>broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:</a>
<a id='line_1114'>8:52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,</a>
<a id='line_1115'>and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them</a>
<a id='line_1116'>in all that they call for unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>8:53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the</a>
<a id='line_1119'>earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses</a>
<a id='line_1120'>thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD</a>
<a id='line_1121'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1122'></a>
<a id='line_1123'>8:54 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all</a>
<a id='line_1124'>this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the</a>
<a id='line_1125'>altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up</a>
<a id='line_1126'>to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>8:55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a</a>
<a id='line_1129'>loud voice, saying, 8:56 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest</a>
<a id='line_1130'>unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath</a>
<a id='line_1131'>not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>hand of Moses his servant.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him</a>
<a id='line_1135'>not leave us, nor forsake us: 8:58 That he may incline our hearts unto</a>
<a id='line_1136'>him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his</a>
<a id='line_1137'>statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1138'></a>
<a id='line_1139'>8:59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before</a>
<a id='line_1140'>the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he</a>
<a id='line_1141'>maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel</a>
<a id='line_1142'>at all times, as the matter shall require: 8:60 That all the people of</a>
<a id='line_1143'>the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.</a>
<a id='line_1144'></a>
<a id='line_1145'>8:61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to</a>
<a id='line_1146'>walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</a>
<a id='line_1147'></a>
<a id='line_1148'>8:62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before</a>
<a id='line_1149'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he</a>
<a id='line_1152'>offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_1153'>and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_1154'>dedicated the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>8:64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was</a>
<a id='line_1157'>before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the</a>
<a id='line_1159'>brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the</a>
<a id='line_1160'>burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace</a>
<a id='line_1161'>offerings.</a>
<a id='line_1162'></a>
<a id='line_1163'>8:65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a</a>
<a id='line_1164'>great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of</a>
<a id='line_1165'>Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even</a>
<a id='line_1166'>fourteen days.</a>
<a id='line_1167'></a>
<a id='line_1168'>8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the</a>
<a id='line_1169'>king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the</a>
<a id='line_1170'>goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel</a>
<a id='line_1171'>his people.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the</a>
<a id='line_1174'>house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire</a>
<a id='line_1175'>which he was pleased to do, 9:2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_1177'></a>
<a id='line_1178'>9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy</a>
<a id='line_1179'>supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this</a>
<a id='line_1180'>house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine</a>
<a id='line_1181'>eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in</a>
<a id='line_1184'>integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I</a>
<a id='line_1185'>have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 9:5</a>
<a id='line_1186'>Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,</a>
<a id='line_1187'>as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a</a>
<a id='line_1188'>man upon the throne of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1189'></a>
<a id='line_1190'>9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your</a>
<a id='line_1191'>children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I</a>
<a id='line_1192'>have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</a>
<a id='line_1193'>9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given</a>
<a id='line_1194'>them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast</a>
<a id='line_1195'>out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all</a>
<a id='line_1196'>people: 9:8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth</a>
<a id='line_1197'>by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why</a>
<a id='line_1198'>hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?  9:9 And</a>
<a id='line_1199'>they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who</a>
<a id='line_1200'>brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken</a>
<a id='line_1201'>hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:</a>
<a id='line_1202'>therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had</a>
<a id='line_1205'>built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,</a>
<a id='line_1206'>9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar</a>
<a id='line_1207'>trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that</a>
<a id='line_1208'>then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_1209'></a>
<a id='line_1210'>9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had</a>
<a id='line_1211'>given him; and they pleased him not.</a>
<a id='line_1212'></a>
<a id='line_1213'>9:13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my</a>
<a id='line_1214'>brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1215'></a>
<a id='line_1216'>9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</a>
<a id='line_1217'></a>
<a id='line_1218'>9:15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for</a>
<a id='line_1219'>to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the</a>
<a id='line_1220'>wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt</a>
<a id='line_1223'>it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and</a>
<a id='line_1224'>given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_1225'></a>
<a id='line_1226'>9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18 And</a>
<a id='line_1227'>Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 9:19 And all the</a>
<a id='line_1228'>cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and</a>
<a id='line_1229'>cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in</a>
<a id='line_1230'>Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</a>
<a id='line_1231'></a>
<a id='line_1232'>9:20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of</a>
<a id='line_1234'>Israel, 9:21 Their children that were left after them in the land,</a>
<a id='line_1235'>whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_1236'>upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>9:22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but</a>
<a id='line_1239'>they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his</a>
<a id='line_1240'>captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s</a>
<a id='line_1243'>work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that</a>
<a id='line_1244'>wrought in the work.</a>
<a id='line_1245'></a>
<a id='line_1246'>9:24 But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her</a>
<a id='line_1247'>house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and</a>
<a id='line_1250'>peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he</a>
<a id='line_1251'>burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished</a>
<a id='line_1252'>the house.</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is</a>
<a id='line_1255'>beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</a>
<a id='line_1256'></a>
<a id='line_1257'>9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had</a>
<a id='line_1258'>knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_1259'></a>
<a id='line_1260'>9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four</a>
<a id='line_1261'>hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_1262'></a>
<a id='line_1263'>10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon</a>
<a id='line_1264'>concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard</a>
<a id='line_1265'>questions.</a>
<a id='line_1266'></a>
<a id='line_1267'>10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels</a>
<a id='line_1268'>that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when</a>
<a id='line_1269'>she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her</a>
<a id='line_1270'>heart.</a>
<a id='line_1271'></a>
<a id='line_1272'>10:3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing</a>
<a id='line_1273'>hid from the king, which he told her not.</a>
<a id='line_1274'></a>
<a id='line_1275'>10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_1276'>the house that he had built, 10:5 And the meat of his table, and the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and</a>
<a id='line_1278'>their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up</a>
<a id='line_1279'>unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</a>
<a id='line_1280'></a>
<a id='line_1281'>10:6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in</a>
<a id='line_1282'>mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_1283'></a>
<a id='line_1284'>10:7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had</a>
<a id='line_1285'>seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and</a>
<a id='line_1286'>prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand</a>
<a id='line_1289'>continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>10:9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee</a>
<a id='line_1292'>on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever,</a>
<a id='line_1293'>therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.</a>
<a id='line_1294'></a>
<a id='line_1295'>10:10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and</a>
<a id='line_1296'>of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more</a>
<a id='line_1297'>such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to</a>
<a id='line_1298'>king Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_1299'></a>
<a id='line_1300'>10:11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,</a>
<a id='line_1301'>brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious</a>
<a id='line_1302'>stones.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>10:12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of</a>
<a id='line_1305'>the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for</a>
<a id='line_1306'>singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1307'></a>
<a id='line_1308'>10:13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,</a>
<a id='line_1309'>whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal</a>
<a id='line_1310'>bounty.</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</a>
<a id='line_1313'></a>
<a id='line_1314'>10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six</a>
<a id='line_1315'>hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 10:15 Beside that he had</a>
<a id='line_1316'>of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of</a>
<a id='line_1317'>all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</a>
<a id='line_1318'></a>
<a id='line_1319'>10:16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six</a>
<a id='line_1320'>hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</a>
<a id='line_1321'></a>
<a id='line_1322'>10:17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of</a>
<a id='line_1323'>gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the</a>
<a id='line_1324'>forest of Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_1325'></a>
<a id='line_1326'>10:18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it</a>
<a id='line_1327'>with the best gold.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>10:19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round</a>
<a id='line_1330'>behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,</a>
<a id='line_1331'>and two lions stood beside the stays.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>10:20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other</a>
<a id='line_1334'>upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>10:21 And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all</a>
<a id='line_1337'>the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;</a>
<a id='line_1338'>none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of</a>
<a id='line_1339'>Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_1340'></a>
<a id='line_1341'>10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of</a>
<a id='line_1342'>Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold,</a>
<a id='line_1343'>and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</a>
<a id='line_1344'></a>
<a id='line_1345'>10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches</a>
<a id='line_1346'>and for wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>10:24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which</a>
<a id='line_1349'>God had put in his heart.</a>
<a id='line_1350'></a>
<a id='line_1351'>10:25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and</a>
<a id='line_1352'>vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and</a>
<a id='line_1353'>mules, a rate year by year.</a>
<a id='line_1354'></a>
<a id='line_1355'>10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had</a>
<a id='line_1356'>a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,</a>
<a id='line_1357'>whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at</a>
<a id='line_1358'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1359'></a>
<a id='line_1360'>10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and</a>
<a id='line_1361'>cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for</a>
<a id='line_1362'>abundance.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the</a>
<a id='line_1365'>king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</a>
<a id='line_1366'></a>
<a id='line_1367'>10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred</a>
<a id='line_1368'>shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for</a>
<a id='line_1369'>all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they</a>
<a id='line_1370'>bring them out by their means.</a>
<a id='line_1371'></a>
<a id='line_1372'>11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the</a>
<a id='line_1373'>daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,</a>
<a id='line_1374'>Zidonians, and Hittites: 11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1375'>said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither</a>
<a id='line_1376'>shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart</a>
<a id='line_1377'>after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.</a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred</a>
<a id='line_1380'>concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</a>
<a id='line_1381'></a>
<a id='line_1382'>11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned</a>
<a id='line_1383'>away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with</a>
<a id='line_1384'>the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</a>
<a id='line_1385'></a>
<a id='line_1386'>11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,</a>
<a id='line_1387'>and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully</a>
<a id='line_1390'>after the LORD, as did David his father.</a>
<a id='line_1391'></a>
<a id='line_1392'>11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination</a>
<a id='line_1393'>of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>abomination of the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1395'></a>
<a id='line_1396'>11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt</a>
<a id='line_1397'>incense and sacrificed unto their gods.</a>
<a id='line_1398'></a>
<a id='line_1399'>11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned</a>
<a id='line_1400'>from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 11:10</a>
<a id='line_1401'>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go</a>
<a id='line_1402'>after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done</a>
<a id='line_1405'>of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I</a>
<a id='line_1406'>have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and</a>
<a id='line_1407'>will give it to thy servant.</a>
<a id='line_1408'></a>
<a id='line_1409'>11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy</a>
<a id='line_1410'>father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'>11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one</a>
<a id='line_1413'>tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake</a>
<a id='line_1414'>which I have chosen.</a>
<a id='line_1415'></a>
<a id='line_1416'>11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the</a>
<a id='line_1417'>Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.</a>
<a id='line_1418'></a>
<a id='line_1419'>11:15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the</a>
<a id='line_1420'>captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had</a>
<a id='line_1421'>smitten every male in Edom; 11:16 (For six months did Joab remain</a>
<a id='line_1422'>there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 11:17</a>
<a id='line_1423'>That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with</a>
<a id='line_1424'>him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.</a>
<a id='line_1425'></a>
<a id='line_1426'>11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took</a>
<a id='line_1427'>men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king</a>
<a id='line_1428'>of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and</a>
<a id='line_1429'>gave him land.</a>
<a id='line_1430'></a>
<a id='line_1431'>11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he</a>
<a id='line_1432'>gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes</a>
<a id='line_1433'>the queen.</a>
<a id='line_1434'></a>
<a id='line_1435'>11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom</a>
<a id='line_1436'>Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s</a>
<a id='line_1437'>household among the sons of Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_1438'></a>
<a id='line_1439'>11:21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,</a>
<a id='line_1440'>and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,</a>
<a id='line_1441'>Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</a>
<a id='line_1442'></a>
<a id='line_1443'>11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he</a>
<a id='line_1445'>answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</a>
<a id='line_1446'></a>
<a id='line_1447'>11:23 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of</a>
<a id='line_1448'>Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 11:24 And</a>
<a id='line_1449'>he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David</a>
<a id='line_1450'>slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and</a>
<a id='line_1451'>reigned in Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_1452'></a>
<a id='line_1453'>11:25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_1454'>beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_1455'>reigned over Syria.</a>
<a id='line_1456'></a>
<a id='line_1457'>11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,</a>
<a id='line_1458'>Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even</a>
<a id='line_1459'>he lifted up his hand against the king.</a>
<a id='line_1460'></a>
<a id='line_1461'>11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the</a>
<a id='line_1462'>king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of</a>
<a id='line_1463'>David his father.</a>
<a id='line_1464'></a>
<a id='line_1465'>11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon</a>
<a id='line_1466'>seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over</a>
<a id='line_1467'>all the charge of the house of Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of</a>
<a id='line_1470'>Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;</a>
<a id='line_1471'>and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in</a>
<a id='line_1472'>the field: 11:30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him,</a>
<a id='line_1473'>and rent it in twelve pieces: 11:31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee</a>
<a id='line_1474'>ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_1475'>rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes</a>
<a id='line_1476'>to thee: 11:32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s</a>
<a id='line_1477'>sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of</a>
<a id='line_1478'>all the tribes of Israel:) 11:33 Because that they have forsaken me,</a>
<a id='line_1479'>and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh</a>
<a id='line_1480'>the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,</a>
<a id='line_1481'>and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine</a>
<a id='line_1482'>eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his</a>
<a id='line_1483'>father.</a>
<a id='line_1484'></a>
<a id='line_1485'>11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I</a>
<a id='line_1486'>will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s</a>
<a id='line_1487'>sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</a>
<a id='line_1488'>11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give</a>
<a id='line_1489'>it unto thee, even ten tribes.</a>
<a id='line_1490'></a>
<a id='line_1491'>11:36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant</a>
<a id='line_1492'>may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have</a>
<a id='line_1493'>chosen me to put my name there.</a>
<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that</a>
<a id='line_1496'>thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1497'></a>
<a id='line_1498'>11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command</a>
<a id='line_1499'>thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to</a>
<a id='line_1500'>keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I</a>
<a id='line_1501'>will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,</a>
<a id='line_1502'>and will give Israel unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1503'></a>
<a id='line_1504'>11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1505'></a>
<a id='line_1506'>11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,</a>
<a id='line_1507'>and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt</a>
<a id='line_1508'>until the death of Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and</a>
<a id='line_1511'>his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</a>
<a id='line_1512'>11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel</a>
<a id='line_1513'>was forty years.</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city</a>
<a id='line_1516'>of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_1517'></a>
<a id='line_1518'>12:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem</a>
<a id='line_1519'>to make him king.</a>
<a id='line_1520'></a>
<a id='line_1521'>12:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet</a>
<a id='line_1522'>in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king</a>
<a id='line_1523'>Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 12:3 That they sent and called</a>
<a id='line_1524'>him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake</a>
<a id='line_1525'>unto Rehoboam, saying, 12:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now</a>
<a id='line_1526'>therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy</a>
<a id='line_1527'>yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</a>
<a id='line_1528'></a>
<a id='line_1529'>12:5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again</a>
<a id='line_1530'>to me. And the people departed.</a>
<a id='line_1531'></a>
<a id='line_1532'>12:6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before</a>
<a id='line_1533'>Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that</a>
<a id='line_1534'>I may answer this people?  12:7 And they spake unto him, saying, If</a>
<a id='line_1535'>thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them,</a>
<a id='line_1536'>and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy</a>
<a id='line_1537'>servants for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1538'></a>
<a id='line_1539'>12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given</a>
<a id='line_1540'>him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and</a>
<a id='line_1541'>which stood before him: 12:9 And he said unto them, What counsel give</a>
<a id='line_1542'>ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make</a>
<a id='line_1543'>the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?  12:10 And the</a>
<a id='line_1544'>young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus</a>
<a id='line_1545'>shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy</a>
<a id='line_1546'>father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus</a>
<a id='line_1547'>shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my</a>
<a id='line_1548'>father’s loins.</a>
<a id='line_1549'></a>
<a id='line_1550'>12:11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will</a>
<a id='line_1551'>add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will</a>
<a id='line_1552'>chastise you with scorpions.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,</a>
<a id='line_1555'>as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</a>
<a id='line_1556'></a>
<a id='line_1557'>12:13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old</a>
<a id='line_1558'>men’s counsel that they gave him; 12:14 And spake to them after the</a>
<a id='line_1559'>counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and</a>
<a id='line_1560'>I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but</a>
<a id='line_1561'>I will chastise you with scorpions.</a>
<a id='line_1562'></a>
<a id='line_1563'>12:15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause</a>
<a id='line_1564'>was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1565'>spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</a>
<a id='line_1566'></a>
<a id='line_1567'>12:16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1568'>the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?</a>
<a id='line_1569'>neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O</a>
<a id='line_1570'>Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto</a>
<a id='line_1571'>their tents.</a>
<a id='line_1572'></a>
<a id='line_1573'>12:17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of</a>
<a id='line_1574'>Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>12:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and</a>
<a id='line_1577'>all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king</a>
<a id='line_1578'>Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to</a>
<a id='line_1579'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1580'></a>
<a id='line_1581'>12:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1582'></a>
<a id='line_1583'>12:20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was</a>
<a id='line_1584'>come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and</a>
<a id='line_1585'>made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house</a>
<a id='line_1586'>of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</a>
<a id='line_1587'></a>
<a id='line_1588'>12:21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the</a>
<a id='line_1589'>house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore</a>
<a id='line_1590'>thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house</a>
<a id='line_1591'>of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>12:22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1594'>12:23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto</a>
<a id='line_1595'>all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,</a>
<a id='line_1596'>saying, 12:24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight</a>
<a id='line_1597'>against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his</a>
<a id='line_1598'>house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word</a>
<a id='line_1599'>of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the</a>
<a id='line_1600'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1601'></a>
<a id='line_1602'>12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;</a>
<a id='line_1603'>and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</a>
<a id='line_1604'></a>
<a id='line_1605'>12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to</a>
<a id='line_1606'>the house of David: 12:27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the</a>
<a id='line_1607'>house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people</a>
<a id='line_1608'>turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they</a>
<a id='line_1609'>shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_1610'></a>
<a id='line_1611'>12:28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1612'>and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:</a>
<a id='line_1613'>behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_1614'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>12:30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship</a>
<a id='line_1619'>before the one, even unto Dan.</a>
<a id='line_1620'></a>
<a id='line_1621'>12:31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the</a>
<a id='line_1622'>lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</a>
<a id='line_1623'></a>
<a id='line_1624'>12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the</a>
<a id='line_1625'>fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_1626'>he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the</a>
<a id='line_1627'>calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the</a>
<a id='line_1628'>high places which he had made.</a>
<a id='line_1629'></a>
<a id='line_1630'>12:33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the</a>
<a id='line_1631'>fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had</a>
<a id='line_1632'>devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_1633'>Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</a>
<a id='line_1634'></a>
<a id='line_1635'>13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of</a>
<a id='line_1636'>the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</a>
<a id='line_1637'></a>
<a id='line_1638'>13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,</a>
<a id='line_1639'>O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born</a>
<a id='line_1640'>unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer</a>
<a id='line_1641'>the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s</a>
<a id='line_1642'>bones shall be burnt upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which</a>
<a id='line_1645'>the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes</a>
<a id='line_1646'>that are upon it shall be poured out.</a>
<a id='line_1647'></a>
<a id='line_1648'>13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the</a>
<a id='line_1649'>man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put</a>
<a id='line_1650'>forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it</a>
<a id='line_1652'>in again to him.</a>
<a id='line_1653'></a>
<a id='line_1654'>13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,</a>
<a id='line_1655'>according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of</a>
<a id='line_1656'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1657'></a>
<a id='line_1658'>13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now</a>
<a id='line_1659'>the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be</a>
<a id='line_1660'>restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the</a>
<a id='line_1661'>king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</a>
<a id='line_1662'></a>
<a id='line_1663'>13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and</a>
<a id='line_1664'>refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</a>
<a id='line_1665'></a>
<a id='line_1666'>13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half</a>
<a id='line_1667'>thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor</a>
<a id='line_1668'>drink water in this place: 13:9 For so was it charged me by the word</a>
<a id='line_1669'>of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by</a>
<a id='line_1670'>the same way that thou camest.</a>
<a id='line_1671'></a>
<a id='line_1672'>13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came</a>
<a id='line_1673'>to Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and</a>
<a id='line_1676'>told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in</a>
<a id='line_1677'>Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told</a>
<a id='line_1678'>also to their father.</a>
<a id='line_1679'></a>
<a id='line_1680'>13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons</a>
<a id='line_1681'>had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled</a>
<a id='line_1684'>him the ass: and he rode thereon, 13:14 And went after the man of God,</a>
<a id='line_1685'>and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the</a>
<a id='line_1686'>man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</a>
<a id='line_1689'></a>
<a id='line_1690'>13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:</a>
<a id='line_1691'>neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:</a>
<a id='line_1692'>13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no</a>
<a id='line_1693'>bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou</a>
<a id='line_1694'>camest.</a>
<a id='line_1695'></a>
<a id='line_1696'>13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel</a>
<a id='line_1697'>spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with</a>
<a id='line_1698'>thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he</a>
<a id='line_1699'>lied unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1700'></a>
<a id='line_1701'>13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and</a>
<a id='line_1702'>drank water.</a>
<a id='line_1703'></a>
<a id='line_1704'>13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of</a>
<a id='line_1705'>the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 13:21 And he</a>
<a id='line_1706'>cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_1707'>LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast</a>
<a id='line_1708'>not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 13:22</a>
<a id='line_1709'>But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of</a>
<a id='line_1710'>the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;</a>
<a id='line_1711'>thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1712'></a>
<a id='line_1713'>13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had</a>
<a id='line_1714'>drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom</a>
<a id='line_1715'>he had brought back.</a>
<a id='line_1716'></a>
<a id='line_1717'>13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:</a>
<a id='line_1718'>and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion</a>
<a id='line_1719'>also stood by the carcase.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,</a>
<a id='line_1722'>and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the</a>
<a id='line_1723'>city where the old prophet dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_1724'></a>
<a id='line_1725'>13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard</a>
<a id='line_1726'>thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the</a>
<a id='line_1727'>word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,</a>
<a id='line_1728'>which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1729'>which he spake unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1730'></a>
<a id='line_1731'>13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they</a>
<a id='line_1732'>saddled him.</a>
<a id='line_1733'></a>
<a id='line_1734'>13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass</a>
<a id='line_1735'>and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the</a>
<a id='line_1736'>carcase, nor torn the ass.</a>
<a id='line_1737'></a>
<a id='line_1738'>13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid</a>
<a id='line_1739'>it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the</a>
<a id='line_1740'>city, to mourn and to bury him.</a>
<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over</a>
<a id='line_1743'>him, saying, Alas, my brother!  13:31 And it came to pass, after he</a>
<a id='line_1744'>had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my</a>
<a id='line_1746'>bones beside his bones: 13:32 For the saying which he cried by the</a>
<a id='line_1747'>word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the</a>
<a id='line_1748'>houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall</a>
<a id='line_1749'>surely come to pass.</a>
<a id='line_1750'></a>
<a id='line_1751'>13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but</a>
<a id='line_1752'>made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:</a>
<a id='line_1753'>whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests</a>
<a id='line_1754'>of the high places.</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>13:34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to</a>
<a id='line_1757'>cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1758'></a>
<a id='line_1759'>14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</a>
<a id='line_1760'></a>
<a id='line_1761'>14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise</a>
<a id='line_1762'>thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get</a>
<a id='line_1763'>thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me</a>
<a id='line_1764'>that I should be king over this people.</a>
<a id='line_1765'></a>
<a id='line_1766'>14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of</a>
<a id='line_1767'>honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the</a>
<a id='line_1768'>child.</a>
<a id='line_1769'></a>
<a id='line_1770'>14:4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and</a>
<a id='line_1771'>came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes</a>
<a id='line_1772'>were set by reason of his age.</a>
<a id='line_1773'></a>
<a id='line_1774'>14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam</a>
<a id='line_1775'>cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and</a>
<a id='line_1776'>thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in,</a>
<a id='line_1777'>that she shall feign herself to be another woman.</a>
<a id='line_1778'></a>
<a id='line_1779'>14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she</a>
<a id='line_1780'>came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why</a>
<a id='line_1781'>feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy</a>
<a id='line_1782'>tidings.</a>
<a id='line_1783'></a>
<a id='line_1784'>14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch</a>
<a id='line_1785'>as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my</a>
<a id='line_1786'>people Israel, 14:8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David,</a>
<a id='line_1787'>and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who</a>
<a id='line_1788'>kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do</a>
<a id='line_1789'>that only which was right in mine eyes; 14:9 But hast done evil above</a>
<a id='line_1790'>all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other</a>
<a id='line_1791'>gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me</a>
<a id='line_1792'>behind thy back: 14:10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth</a>
<a id='line_1794'>against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will</a>
<a id='line_1795'>take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away</a>
<a id='line_1796'>dung, till it be all gone.</a>
<a id='line_1797'></a>
<a id='line_1798'>14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and</a>
<a id='line_1799'>him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the</a>
<a id='line_1800'>LORD hath spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_1801'></a>
<a id='line_1802'>14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy</a>
<a id='line_1803'>feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</a>
<a id='line_1804'></a>
<a id='line_1805'>14:13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of</a>
<a id='line_1806'>Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some</a>
<a id='line_1807'>good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</a>
<a id='line_1808'></a>
<a id='line_1809'>14:14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who</a>
<a id='line_1810'>shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.</a>
<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>14:15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the</a>
<a id='line_1813'>water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he</a>
<a id='line_1814'>gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.</a>
<a id='line_1816'></a>
<a id='line_1817'>14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who</a>
<a id='line_1818'>did sin, and who made Israel to sin.</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>14:17 And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and</a>
<a id='line_1821'>when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 14:18 And</a>
<a id='line_1822'>they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word</a>
<a id='line_1823'>of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the</a>
<a id='line_1824'>prophet.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he</a>
<a id='line_1827'>reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the</a>
<a id='line_1828'>kings of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1829'></a>
<a id='line_1830'>14:20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:</a>
<a id='line_1831'>and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_1832'></a>
<a id='line_1833'>14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was</a>
<a id='line_1834'>forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_1835'>seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out</a>
<a id='line_1836'>of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s</a>
<a id='line_1837'>name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</a>
<a id='line_1838'></a>
<a id='line_1839'>14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked</a>
<a id='line_1840'>him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all</a>
<a id='line_1841'>that their fathers had done.</a>
<a id='line_1842'></a>
<a id='line_1843'>14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on</a>
<a id='line_1844'>every high hill, and under every green tree.</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did</a>
<a id='line_1847'>according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast</a>
<a id='line_1848'>out before the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1849'></a>
<a id='line_1850'>14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that</a>
<a id='line_1851'>Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 14:26 And he took</a>
<a id='line_1852'>away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the</a>
<a id='line_1853'>king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields</a>
<a id='line_1854'>of gold which Solomon had made.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>14:27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and</a>
<a id='line_1857'>committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept</a>
<a id='line_1858'>the door of the king’s house.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard</a>
<a id='line_1862'>chamber.</a>
<a id='line_1863'></a>
<a id='line_1864'>14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are</a>
<a id='line_1865'>they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</a>

<a id='line_1868'>14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his</a>
<a id='line_1869'>fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah an</a>

<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat</a>

<a id='line_1881'></a>
<a id='line_1882'>15:4 Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a</a>

<a id='line_1884'>Jerusalem: 15:5 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_1885'>the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him</a>
<a id='line_1886'>all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the</a>
<a id='line_1887'>Hittite.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>15:6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of</a>

<a id='line_1893'>not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And</a>
<a id='line_1894'>there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</a>
<a id='line_1895'></a>
<a id='line_1896'>15:8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the</a>
<a id='line_1897'>city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_1898'></a>
<a id='line_1899'>15:9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa</a>
<a id='line_1900'>over Judah.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>15:10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his</a>
<a id='line_1903'>mother’s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did</a>
<a id='line_1906'>David his father.</a>
<a id='line_1907'></a>
<a id='line_1908'>15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all</a>
<a id='line_1909'>the idols that his fathers had made.</a>
<a id='line_1910'></a>
<a id='line_1911'>15:13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being</a>
<a id='line_1912'>queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her</a>
<a id='line_1913'>idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.</a>
<a id='line_1914'></a>
<a id='line_1915'>15:14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart</a>
<a id='line_1916'>was perfect with the LORD all his days.</a>
<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>15:15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and</a>
<a id='line_1919'>the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1920'>silver, and gold, and vessels.</a>
<a id='line_1921'></a>
<a id='line_1922'>15:16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all</a>
<a id='line_1923'>their days.</a>
<a id='line_1924'></a>
<a id='line_1925'>15:17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built</a>
<a id='line_1926'>Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king</a>
<a id='line_1927'>of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_1928'></a>
<a id='line_1929'>15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the</a>
<a id='line_1930'>treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1931'>house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa</a>
<a id='line_1932'>sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of</a>
<a id='line_1933'>Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 15:19 There is a league between</a>
<a id='line_1934'>me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent</a>
<a id='line_1935'>unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with</a>
<a id='line_1936'>Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</a>
<a id='line_1937'></a>
<a id='line_1938'>15:20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of</a>
<a id='line_1939'>the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon,</a>
<a id='line_1940'>and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of</a>
<a id='line_1941'>Naphtali.</a>
<a id='line_1942'></a>
<a id='line_1943'>15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off</a>
<a id='line_1944'>building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</a>
<a id='line_1945'></a>
<a id='line_1946'>15:22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was</a>
<a id='line_1947'>exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber</a>
<a id='line_1948'>thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them</a>
<a id='line_1949'>Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</a>
<a id='line_1950'></a>
<a id='line_1951'>15:23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that</a>
<a id='line_1952'>he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the</a>
<a id='line_1953'>book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time</a>
<a id='line_1954'>of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>15:24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers</a>
<a id='line_1957'>in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in</a>
<a id='line_1958'>his stead.</a>
<a id='line_1959'></a>
<a id='line_1960'>15:25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the</a>
<a id='line_1961'>second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.</a>
<a id='line_1962'></a>
<a id='line_1963'>15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way</a>
<a id='line_1964'>of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</a>
<a id='line_1965'></a>
<a id='line_1966'>15:27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,</a>
<a id='line_1967'>conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which</a>
<a id='line_1968'>belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to</a>
<a id='line_1969'>Gibbethon.</a>
<a id='line_1970'></a>
<a id='line_1971'>15:28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,</a>
<a id='line_1972'>and reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_1973'></a>
<a id='line_1974'>15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the</a>
<a id='line_1975'>house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he</a>
<a id='line_1976'>had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he</a>
<a id='line_1977'>spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 15:30 Because of the sins</a>
<a id='line_1978'>of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his</a>
<a id='line_1979'>provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.</a>
<a id='line_1980'></a>
<a id='line_1981'>15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they</a>
<a id='line_1982'>not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</a>
<a id='line_1983'>15:32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all</a>
<a id='line_1984'>their days.</a>
<a id='line_1985'></a>
<a id='line_1986'>15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of</a>
<a id='line_1987'>Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.</a>
<a id='line_1988'></a>
<a id='line_1989'>15:34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way</a>
<a id='line_1990'>of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</a>
<a id='line_1991'></a>
<a id='line_1992'>16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against</a>
<a id='line_1993'>Baasha, saying, 16:2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and</a>
<a id='line_1994'>made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me</a>
<a id='line_1996'>to anger with their sins; 16:3 Behold, I will take away the posterity</a>
<a id='line_1997'>of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house</a>
<a id='line_1998'>like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</a>
<a id='line_1999'></a>
<a id='line_2000'>16:4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him</a>
<a id='line_2001'>that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.</a>
<a id='line_2002'></a>
<a id='line_2003'>16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his</a>
<a id='line_2004'>might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings</a>
<a id='line_2005'>of Israel?  16:6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in</a>
<a id='line_2006'>Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2007'></a>
<a id='line_2008'>16:7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came</a>
<a id='line_2009'>the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for</a>
<a id='line_2010'>all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to</a>
<a id='line_2011'>anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam;</a>
<a id='line_2012'>and because he killed him.</a>
<a id='line_2013'></a>
<a id='line_2014'>16:8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the</a>
<a id='line_2015'>son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.</a>
<a id='line_2016'></a>
<a id='line_2017'>16:9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired</a>
<a id='line_2018'>against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house</a>
<a id='line_2019'>of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.</a>
<a id='line_2020'></a>
<a id='line_2021'>16:10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty</a>
<a id='line_2022'>and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>16:11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat</a>
<a id='line_2025'>on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not</a>
<a id='line_2026'>one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his</a>
<a id='line_2027'>friends.</a>
<a id='line_2028'></a>
<a id='line_2029'>16:12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the</a>
<a id='line_2030'>word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.</a>
<a id='line_2031'></a>
<a id='line_2032'>16:13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by</a>
<a id='line_2033'>which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking</a>
<a id='line_2034'>the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</a>
<a id='line_2035'></a>
<a id='line_2036'>16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they</a>
<a id='line_2037'>not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</a>
<a id='line_2038'>16:15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri</a>
<a id='line_2039'>reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against</a>
<a id='line_2040'>Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_2041'></a>
<a id='line_2042'>16:16 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath</a>
<a id='line_2043'>conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made</a>
<a id='line_2044'>Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.</a>
<a id='line_2045'></a>
<a id='line_2046'>16:17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and</a>
<a id='line_2047'>they besieged Tirzah.</a>
<a id='line_2048'></a>
<a id='line_2049'>16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s</a>
<a id='line_2051'>house over him with fire, and died.</a>
<a id='line_2052'></a>
<a id='line_2053'>16:19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_2054'>LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did,</a>
<a id='line_2055'>to make Israel to sin.</a>
<a id='line_2056'></a>
<a id='line_2057'>16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he</a>
<a id='line_2058'>wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the</a>
<a id='line_2059'>kings of Israel?  16:21 Then were the people of Israel divided into</a>
<a id='line_2060'>two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to</a>
<a id='line_2061'>make him king; and half followed Omri.</a>
<a id='line_2062'></a>
<a id='line_2063'>16:22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people</a>
<a id='line_2064'>that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri</a>
<a id='line_2065'>reigned.</a>
<a id='line_2066'></a>
<a id='line_2067'>16:23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to</a>
<a id='line_2068'>reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.</a>
<a id='line_2069'></a>
<a id='line_2070'>16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of</a>
<a id='line_2071'>silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which</a>
<a id='line_2072'>he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2073'></a>
<a id='line_2074'>16:25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse</a>
<a id='line_2075'>than all that were before him.</a>
<a id='line_2076'></a>
<a id='line_2077'>16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and</a>
<a id='line_2078'>in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_2079'>Israel to anger with their vanities.</a>
<a id='line_2080'></a>
<a id='line_2081'>16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might</a>
<a id='line_2082'>that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of</a>
<a id='line_2083'>the kings of Israel?  16:28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was</a>
<a id='line_2084'>buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2085'></a>
<a id='line_2086'>16:29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began</a>
<a id='line_2087'>Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri</a>
<a id='line_2088'>reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.</a>
<a id='line_2089'></a>
<a id='line_2090'>16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above</a>
<a id='line_2091'>all that were before him.</a>
<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to</a>
<a id='line_2094'>walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife</a>
<a id='line_2095'>Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and</a>
<a id='line_2096'>served Baal, and worshipped him.</a>
<a id='line_2097'></a>
<a id='line_2098'>16:32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which</a>
<a id='line_2099'>he had built in Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2100'></a>
<a id='line_2101'>16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God</a>
<a id='line_2102'>of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.</a>
<a id='line_2103'></a>
<a id='line_2104'>16:34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the</a>
<a id='line_2105'>foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates</a>
<a id='line_2106'>thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2107'>which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</a>
<a id='line_2108'></a>
<a id='line_2109'>17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,</a>
<a id='line_2111'>there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.</a>
<a id='line_2112'></a>
<a id='line_2113'>17:2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:3 Get thee</a>
<a id='line_2114'>hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,</a>
<a id='line_2115'>that is before Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_2116'></a>
<a id='line_2117'>17:4 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have</a>
<a id='line_2118'>commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</a>
<a id='line_2119'></a>
<a id='line_2120'>17:5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he</a>
<a id='line_2121'>went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_2122'></a>
<a id='line_2123'>17:6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and</a>
<a id='line_2124'>bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</a>
<a id='line_2125'></a>
<a id='line_2126'>17:7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,</a>
<a id='line_2127'>because there had been no rain in the land.</a>
<a id='line_2128'></a>
<a id='line_2129'>17:8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:9 Arise, get</a>
<a id='line_2130'>thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold,</a>
<a id='line_2131'>I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</a>
<a id='line_2132'></a>
<a id='line_2133'>17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate</a>
<a id='line_2134'>of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks:</a>
<a id='line_2135'>and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water</a>
<a id='line_2136'>in a vessel, that I may drink.</a>
<a id='line_2137'></a>
<a id='line_2138'>17:11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_2140'></a>
<a id='line_2141'>17:12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but</a>
<a id='line_2142'>an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for</a>
<a id='line_2144'>me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</a>
<a id='line_2145'></a>
<a id='line_2146'>17:13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:</a>
<a id='line_2147'>but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and</a>
<a id='line_2148'>after make for thee and for thy son.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>17:14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall</a>
<a id='line_2151'>not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the</a>
<a id='line_2152'>LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2153'></a>
<a id='line_2154'>17:15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,</a>
<a id='line_2155'>and he, and her house, did eat many days.</a>
<a id='line_2156'></a>
<a id='line_2157'>17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil</a>
<a id='line_2158'>fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.</a>
<a id='line_2159'></a>
<a id='line_2160'>17:17 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the</a>
<a id='line_2161'>woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so</a>
<a id='line_2162'>sore, that there was no breath left in him.</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>17:18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou</a>
<a id='line_2165'>man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and</a>
<a id='line_2166'>to slay my son?  17:19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he</a>
<a id='line_2167'>took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he</a>
<a id='line_2168'>abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</a>
<a id='line_2169'></a>
<a id='line_2170'>17:20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou</a>
<a id='line_2171'>also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her</a>
<a id='line_2172'>son?  17:21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and</a>
<a id='line_2173'>cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this</a>
<a id='line_2174'>child’s soul come into him again.</a>
<a id='line_2175'></a>
<a id='line_2176'>17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the</a>
<a id='line_2177'>child came into him again, and he revived.</a>
<a id='line_2178'></a>
<a id='line_2179'>17:23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the</a>
<a id='line_2180'>chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah</a>
<a id='line_2181'>said, See, thy son liveth.</a>
<a id='line_2182'></a>
<a id='line_2183'>17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a</a>
<a id='line_2184'>man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.</a>
<a id='line_2185'></a>
<a id='line_2186'>18:1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2187'>came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab;</a>
<a id='line_2188'>and I will send rain upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2189'></a>
<a id='line_2190'>18:2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore</a>
<a id='line_2191'>famine in Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2192'></a>
<a id='line_2193'>18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.</a>
<a id='line_2194'>(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 18:4 For it was so, when Jezebel</a>
<a id='line_2195'>cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred</a>
<a id='line_2196'>prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and</a>
<a id='line_2197'>water.)  18:5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all</a>
<a id='line_2198'>fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find</a>
<a id='line_2199'>grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the</a>
<a id='line_2200'>beasts.</a>
<a id='line_2201'></a>
<a id='line_2202'>18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab</a>
<a id='line_2203'>went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</a>
<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he</a>
<a id='line_2206'>knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord</a>
<a id='line_2207'>Elijah?  18:8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_2208'>Elijah is here.</a>
<a id='line_2209'></a>
<a id='line_2210'>18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy</a>
<a id='line_2211'>servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  18:10 As the LORD thy God</a>
<a id='line_2212'>liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent</a>
<a id='line_2213'>to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of</a>
<a id='line_2214'>the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</a>
<a id='line_2215'></a>
<a id='line_2216'>18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</a>
<a id='line_2217'></a>
<a id='line_2218'>18:12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that</a>
<a id='line_2219'>the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so</a>
<a id='line_2220'>when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me:</a>
<a id='line_2221'>but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</a>
<a id='line_2222'></a>
<a id='line_2223'>18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the</a>
<a id='line_2224'>prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’s prophets</a>
<a id='line_2225'>by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  18:14 And now</a>
<a id='line_2226'>thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall</a>
<a id='line_2227'>slay me.</a>
<a id='line_2228'></a>
<a id='line_2229'>18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I</a>
<a id='line_2230'>stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</a>
<a id='line_2231'></a>
<a id='line_2232'>18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to</a>
<a id='line_2233'>meet Elijah.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto</a>
<a id='line_2236'>him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  18:18 And he answered, I have</a>
<a id='line_2237'>not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have</a>
<a id='line_2238'>forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.</a>
<a id='line_2239'></a>
<a id='line_2240'>18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount</a>
<a id='line_2241'>Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the</a>
<a id='line_2242'>prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.</a>
<a id='line_2243'></a>
<a id='line_2244'>18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the</a>
<a id='line_2245'>prophets together unto mount Carmel.</a>
<a id='line_2246'></a>
<a id='line_2247'>18:21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye</a>
<a id='line_2248'>between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal,</a>
<a id='line_2249'>then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</a>
<a id='line_2250'></a>
<a id='line_2251'>18:22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a</a>
<a id='line_2252'>prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty</a>
<a id='line_2253'>men.</a>
<a id='line_2254'></a>
<a id='line_2255'>18:23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one</a>
<a id='line_2256'>bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and</a>
<a id='line_2257'>put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on</a>
<a id='line_2258'>wood, and put no fire under: 18:24 And call ye on the name of your</a>
<a id='line_2259'>gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that</a>
<a id='line_2260'>answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and</a>
<a id='line_2261'>said, It is well spoken.</a>
<a id='line_2262'></a>
<a id='line_2263'>18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one</a>
<a id='line_2264'>bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call</a>
<a id='line_2265'>on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</a>
<a id='line_2266'></a>
<a id='line_2267'>18:26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed</a>
<a id='line_2268'>it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,</a>
<a id='line_2269'>saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that</a>
<a id='line_2270'>answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</a>
<a id='line_2271'></a>
<a id='line_2272'>18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,</a>
<a id='line_2273'>Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,</a>
<a id='line_2274'>or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be</a>
<a id='line_2275'>awaked.</a>
<a id='line_2276'></a>
<a id='line_2277'>18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with</a>
<a id='line_2278'>knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</a>
<a id='line_2279'></a>
<a id='line_2280'>18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied</a>
<a id='line_2281'>until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there</a>
<a id='line_2282'>was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</a>
<a id='line_2283'></a>
<a id='line_2284'>18:30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all</a>
<a id='line_2285'>the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2286'>that was broken down.</a>
<a id='line_2287'></a>
<a id='line_2288'>18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the</a>
<a id='line_2289'>tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,</a>
<a id='line_2290'>saying, Israel shall be thy name: 18:32 And with the stones he built</a>
<a id='line_2291'>an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the</a>
<a id='line_2292'>altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</a>
<a id='line_2293'></a>
<a id='line_2294'>18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and</a>
<a id='line_2295'>laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour</a>
<a id='line_2296'>it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</a>
<a id='line_2297'></a>
<a id='line_2298'>18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second</a>
<a id='line_2299'>time.</a>
<a id='line_2300'></a>
<a id='line_2301'>And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</a>
<a id='line_2302'></a>
<a id='line_2303'>18:35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the</a>
<a id='line_2304'>trench also with water.</a>
<a id='line_2305'></a>
<a id='line_2306'>18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening</a>
<a id='line_2307'>sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_2308'>Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art</a>
<a id='line_2309'>God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all</a>
<a id='line_2310'>these things at thy word.</a>
<a id='line_2311'></a>
<a id='line_2312'>18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou</a>
<a id='line_2313'>art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</a>
<a id='line_2314'></a>
<a id='line_2315'>18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt</a>
<a id='line_2316'>sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up</a>
<a id='line_2317'>the water that was in the trench.</a>
<a id='line_2318'></a>
<a id='line_2319'>18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and</a>
<a id='line_2320'>they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</a>
<a id='line_2321'></a>
<a id='line_2322'>18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not</a>
<a id='line_2323'>one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down</a>
<a id='line_2324'>to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</a>
<a id='line_2325'></a>
<a id='line_2326'>18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there</a>
<a id='line_2327'>is a sound of abundance of rain.</a>
<a id='line_2328'></a>
<a id='line_2329'>18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the</a>
<a id='line_2330'>top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his</a>
<a id='line_2331'>face between his knees, 18:43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look</a>
<a id='line_2332'>toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is</a>
<a id='line_2333'>nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</a>
<a id='line_2334'></a>
<a id='line_2335'>18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_2336'>there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he</a>
<a id='line_2337'>said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down</a>
<a id='line_2338'>that the rain stop thee not.</a>
<a id='line_2339'></a>
<a id='line_2340'>18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black</a>
<a id='line_2341'>with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and</a>
<a id='line_2342'>went to Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_2343'></a>
<a id='line_2344'>18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his</a>
<a id='line_2345'>loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_2346'></a>
<a id='line_2347'>19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he</a>
<a id='line_2348'>had slain all the prophets with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2349'></a>
<a id='line_2350'>19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the</a>
<a id='line_2351'>gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of</a>
<a id='line_2352'>one of them by to morrow about this time.</a>
<a id='line_2353'></a>
<a id='line_2354'>19:3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came</a>
<a id='line_2355'>to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</a>
<a id='line_2356'></a>
<a id='line_2357'>19:4 But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came</a>
<a id='line_2358'>and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that</a>
<a id='line_2359'>he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life;</a>
<a id='line_2360'>for I am not better than my fathers.</a>
<a id='line_2361'></a>
<a id='line_2362'>19:5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an</a>
<a id='line_2363'>angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</a>
<a id='line_2364'></a>
<a id='line_2365'>19:6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,</a>
<a id='line_2366'>and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid</a>
<a id='line_2367'>him down again.</a>
<a id='line_2368'></a>
<a id='line_2369'>19:7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched</a>
<a id='line_2370'>him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for</a>
<a id='line_2371'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_2372'></a>
<a id='line_2373'>19:8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of</a>
<a id='line_2374'>that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</a>
<a id='line_2375'></a>
<a id='line_2376'>19:9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_2377'>the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest</a>
<a id='line_2378'>thou here, Elijah?  19:10 And he said, I have been very jealous for</a>
<a id='line_2379'>the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy</a>
<a id='line_2380'>covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the</a>
<a id='line_2381'>sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it</a>
<a id='line_2382'>away.</a>
<a id='line_2383'></a>
<a id='line_2384'>19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2385'></a>
<a id='line_2386'>And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the</a>
<a id='line_2387'>mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2388'>was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2389'>was not in the earthquake: 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; but</a>
<a id='line_2390'>the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</a>
<a id='line_2391'></a>
<a id='line_2392'>19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in</a>
<a id='line_2393'>his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.</a>
<a id='line_2394'>And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou</a>
<a id='line_2395'>here, Elijah?  19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the</a>
<a id='line_2396'>LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy</a>
<a id='line_2397'>covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the</a>
<a id='line_2398'>sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it</a>
<a id='line_2399'>away.</a>
<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>19:15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the</a>
<a id='line_2402'>wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king</a>
<a id='line_2403'>over Syria: 19:16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be</a>
<a id='line_2404'>king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt</a>
<a id='line_2405'>thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</a>
<a id='line_2406'></a>
<a id='line_2407'>19:17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of</a>
<a id='line_2408'>Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu</a>
<a id='line_2409'>shall Elisha slay.</a>
<a id='line_2410'></a>
<a id='line_2411'>19:18 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which</a>
<a id='line_2412'>have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_2413'></a>
<a id='line_2414'>19:19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who</a>
<a id='line_2415'>was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the</a>
<a id='line_2416'>twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>19:20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I</a>
<a id='line_2419'>pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.</a>
<a id='line_2420'>And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</a>
<a id='line_2421'>19:21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew</a>
<a id='line_2422'>them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and</a>
<a id='line_2423'>gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after</a>
<a id='line_2424'>Elijah, and ministered unto him.</a>
<a id='line_2425'></a>
<a id='line_2426'>20:1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:</a>
<a id='line_2427'>and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and</a>
<a id='line_2428'>chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</a>
<a id='line_2429'></a>
<a id='line_2430'>20:2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and</a>
<a id='line_2431'>said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 20:3 Thy silver and thy gold is</a>
<a id='line_2432'>mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.</a>
<a id='line_2433'></a>
<a id='line_2434'>20:4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,</a>
<a id='line_2435'>according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</a>
<a id='line_2436'></a>
<a id='line_2437'>20:5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,</a>
<a id='line_2438'>saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me</a>
<a id='line_2439'>thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 20:6 Yet I</a>
<a id='line_2440'>will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they</a>
<a id='line_2441'>shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall</a>
<a id='line_2442'>be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in</a>
<a id='line_2443'>their hand, and take it away.</a>
<a id='line_2444'></a>
<a id='line_2445'>20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and</a>
<a id='line_2446'>said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he</a>
<a id='line_2447'>sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and</a>
<a id='line_2448'>for my gold; and I denied him not.</a>
<a id='line_2449'></a>
<a id='line_2450'>20:8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not</a>
<a id='line_2451'>unto him, nor consent.</a>
<a id='line_2452'></a>
<a id='line_2453'>20:9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord</a>
<a id='line_2454'>the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I</a>
<a id='line_2455'>will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and</a>
<a id='line_2456'>brought him word again.</a>
<a id='line_2457'></a>
<a id='line_2458'>20:10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2459'>and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for</a>
<a id='line_2460'>all the people that follow me.</a>
<a id='line_2461'></a>
<a id='line_2462'>20:11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him</a>
<a id='line_2463'>that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.</a>
<a id='line_2464'></a>
<a id='line_2465'>20:12 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he</a>
<a id='line_2466'>was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his</a>
<a id='line_2467'>servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array</a>
<a id='line_2468'>against the city.</a>
<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>20:13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_2471'>saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?</a>
<a id='line_2472'>behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2473'>know that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2474'></a>
<a id='line_2475'>20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even</a>
<a id='line_2476'>by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who</a>
<a id='line_2477'>shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</a>
<a id='line_2478'></a>
<a id='line_2479'>20:15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,</a>
<a id='line_2480'>and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered</a>
<a id='line_2481'>all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'>20:16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself</a>
<a id='line_2484'>drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings</a>
<a id='line_2485'>that helped him.</a>
<a id='line_2486'></a>
<a id='line_2487'>20:17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out</a>
<a id='line_2488'>first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men</a>
<a id='line_2489'>come out of Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2490'></a>
<a id='line_2491'>20:18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them</a>
<a id='line_2492'>alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</a>
<a id='line_2493'></a>
<a id='line_2494'>20:19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of</a>
<a id='line_2495'>the city, and the army which followed them.</a>
<a id='line_2496'></a>
<a id='line_2497'>20:20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and</a>
<a id='line_2498'>Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an</a>
<a id='line_2499'>horse with the horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_2500'></a>
<a id='line_2501'>20:21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and</a>
<a id='line_2502'>chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_2503'></a>
<a id='line_2504'>20:22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2505'>Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the</a>
<a id='line_2506'>return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</a>
<a id='line_2507'></a>
<a id='line_2508'>20:23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods</a>
<a id='line_2509'>are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let</a>
<a id='line_2510'>us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger</a>
<a id='line_2511'>than they.</a>
<a id='line_2512'></a>
<a id='line_2513'>20:24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his</a>
<a id='line_2514'>place, and put captains in their rooms: 20:25 And number thee an army,</a>
<a id='line_2515'>like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for</a>
<a id='line_2516'>chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we</a>
<a id='line_2517'>shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and</a>
<a id='line_2518'>did so.</a>
<a id='line_2519'></a>
<a id='line_2520'>20:26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad</a>
<a id='line_2521'>numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2522'></a>
<a id='line_2523'>20:27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,</a>
<a id='line_2524'>and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them</a>
<a id='line_2525'>like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</a>
<a id='line_2526'></a>
<a id='line_2527'>20:28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_2528'>and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD</a>
<a id='line_2529'>is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will</a>
<a id='line_2530'>I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know</a>
<a id='line_2531'>that I am the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2532'></a>
<a id='line_2533'>20:29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so</a>
<a id='line_2534'>it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the</a>
<a id='line_2535'>children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in</a>
<a id='line_2536'>one day.</a>
<a id='line_2537'></a>
<a id='line_2538'>20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell</a>
<a id='line_2539'>upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad</a>
<a id='line_2540'>fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</a>
<a id='line_2541'></a>
<a id='line_2542'>20:31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that</a>
<a id='line_2543'>the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray</a>
<a id='line_2544'>thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out</a>
<a id='line_2545'>to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</a>
<a id='line_2546'></a>
<a id='line_2547'>20:32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their</a>
<a id='line_2548'>heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad</a>
<a id='line_2549'>saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is</a>
<a id='line_2550'>my brother.</a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'>20:33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come</a>
<a id='line_2553'>from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother</a>
<a id='line_2554'>Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to</a>
<a id='line_2555'>him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>20:34 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took</a>
<a id='line_2558'>from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee</a>
<a id='line_2559'>in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send</a>
<a id='line_2560'>thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent</a>
<a id='line_2561'>him away.</a>
<a id='line_2562'></a>
<a id='line_2563'>20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his</a>
<a id='line_2564'>neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man</a>
<a id='line_2565'>refused to smite him.</a>
<a id='line_2566'></a>
<a id='line_2567'>20:36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of</a>
<a id='line_2568'>the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall</a>
<a id='line_2569'>slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew</a>
<a id='line_2572'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>20:37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And</a>
<a id='line_2575'>the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</a>
<a id='line_2576'></a>
<a id='line_2577'>20:38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and</a>
<a id='line_2578'>disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,</a>
<a id='line_2581'>Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man</a>
<a id='line_2582'>turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if</a>
<a id='line_2583'>by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or</a>
<a id='line_2584'>else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</a>
<a id='line_2585'></a>
<a id='line_2586'>20:40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the</a>
<a id='line_2587'>king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast</a>
<a id='line_2588'>decided it.</a>
<a id='line_2589'></a>
<a id='line_2590'>20:41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the</a>
<a id='line_2591'>king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_2592'></a>
<a id='line_2593'>20:42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let</a>
<a id='line_2594'>go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,</a>
<a id='line_2595'>therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his</a>
<a id='line_2596'>people.</a>
<a id='line_2597'></a>
<a id='line_2598'>20:43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,</a>
<a id='line_2599'>and came to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>21:1 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the</a>
<a id='line_2602'>Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of</a>
<a id='line_2603'>Ahab king of Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2604'></a>
<a id='line_2605'>21:2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I</a>
<a id='line_2606'>may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:</a>
<a id='line_2607'>and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem</a>
<a id='line_2608'>good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>21:3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should</a>
<a id='line_2611'>give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2612'></a>
<a id='line_2613'>21:4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the</a>
<a id='line_2614'>word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I</a>
<a id='line_2615'>will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down</a>
<a id='line_2616'>upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</a>
<a id='line_2617'></a>
<a id='line_2618'>21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy</a>
<a id='line_2619'>spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?  21:6 And he said unto her,</a>
<a id='line_2620'>Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me</a>
<a id='line_2621'>thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee</a>
<a id='line_2622'>another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my</a>
<a id='line_2623'>vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_2624'></a>
<a id='line_2625'>21:7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the</a>
<a id='line_2626'>kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry:</a>
<a id='line_2627'>I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</a>
<a id='line_2628'></a>
<a id='line_2629'>21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his</a>
<a id='line_2630'>seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were</a>
<a id='line_2631'>in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</a>
<a id='line_2632'></a>
<a id='line_2633'>21:9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set</a>
<a id='line_2634'>Naboth on high among the people: 21:10 And set two men, sons of</a>
<a id='line_2635'>Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst</a>
<a id='line_2636'>blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him,</a>
<a id='line_2637'>that he may die.</a>
<a id='line_2638'></a>
<a id='line_2639'>21:11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were</a>
<a id='line_2640'>the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as</a>
<a id='line_2641'>it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</a>
<a id='line_2642'></a>
<a id='line_2643'>21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</a>
<a id='line_2644'></a>
<a id='line_2645'>21:13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before</a>
<a id='line_2646'>him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth,</a>
<a id='line_2647'>in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and</a>
<a id='line_2648'>the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him</a>
<a id='line_2649'>with stones, that he died.</a>
<a id='line_2650'></a>
<a id='line_2651'>21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is</a>
<a id='line_2652'>dead.</a>
<a id='line_2653'></a>
<a id='line_2654'>21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,</a>
<a id='line_2655'>and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the</a>
<a id='line_2656'>vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for</a>
<a id='line_2657'>money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</a>
<a id='line_2658'></a>
<a id='line_2659'>21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that</a>
<a id='line_2660'>Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to</a>
<a id='line_2661'>take possession of it.</a>
<a id='line_2662'></a>
<a id='line_2663'>21:17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2664'>21:18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:</a>
<a id='line_2665'>behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to</a>
<a id='line_2666'>possess it.</a>
<a id='line_2667'></a>
<a id='line_2668'>21:19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast</a>
<a id='line_2669'>thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2670'>saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood</a>
<a id='line_2671'>of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</a>
<a id='line_2672'></a>
<a id='line_2673'>21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And</a>
<a id='line_2674'>he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work</a>
<a id='line_2675'>evil in the sight of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2676'></a>
<a id='line_2677'>21:21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy</a>
<a id='line_2678'>posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the</a>
<a id='line_2679'>wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 21:22 And will make</a>
<a id='line_2680'>thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the</a>
<a id='line_2681'>house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou</a>
<a id='line_2682'>hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</a>
<a id='line_2683'></a>
<a id='line_2684'>21:23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat</a>
<a id='line_2685'>Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_2686'></a>
<a id='line_2687'>21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him</a>
<a id='line_2688'>that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</a>
<a id='line_2689'></a>
<a id='line_2690'>21:25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to</a>
<a id='line_2691'>work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife</a>
<a id='line_2692'>stirred up.</a>
<a id='line_2693'></a>
<a id='line_2694'>21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all</a>
<a id='line_2695'>things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children</a>
<a id='line_2696'>of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2697'></a>
<a id='line_2698'>21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent</a>
<a id='line_2699'>his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in</a>
<a id='line_2700'>sackcloth, and went softly.</a>
<a id='line_2701'></a>
<a id='line_2702'>21:28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2703'>21:29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he</a>
<a id='line_2704'>humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but</a>
<a id='line_2705'>in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</a>
<a id='line_2706'></a>
<a id='line_2707'>22:1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and</a>
<a id='line_2708'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2709'></a>
<a id='line_2710'>22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king</a>
<a id='line_2711'>of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2712'></a>
<a id='line_2713'>22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that</a>
<a id='line_2714'>Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the</a>
<a id='line_2715'>hand of the king of Syria?  22:4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt</a>
<a id='line_2716'>thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the</a>
<a id='line_2717'>king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses</a>
<a id='line_2718'>as thy horses.</a>
<a id='line_2719'></a>
<a id='line_2720'>22:5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray</a>
<a id='line_2721'>thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</a>
<a id='line_2722'></a>
<a id='line_2723'>22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about</a>
<a id='line_2724'>four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead</a>
<a id='line_2725'>to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2726'>shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</a>
<a id='line_2727'></a>
<a id='line_2728'>22:7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2729'>besides, that we might enquire of him?  22:8 And the king of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2730'>said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah,</a>
<a id='line_2731'>by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not</a>
<a id='line_2732'>prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not</a>
<a id='line_2733'>the king say so.</a>
<a id='line_2734'></a>
<a id='line_2735'>22:9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten</a>
<a id='line_2736'>hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.</a>
<a id='line_2737'></a>
<a id='line_2738'>22:10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat</a>
<a id='line_2739'>each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the</a>
<a id='line_2740'>entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied</a>
<a id='line_2741'>before them.</a>
<a id='line_2742'></a>
<a id='line_2743'>22:11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he</a>
<a id='line_2744'>said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians,</a>
<a id='line_2745'>until thou have consumed them.</a>
<a id='line_2746'></a>
<a id='line_2747'>22:12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to</a>
<a id='line_2748'>Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the</a>
<a id='line_2749'>king’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_2750'></a>
<a id='line_2751'>22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2752'>saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the</a>
<a id='line_2753'>king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of</a>
<a id='line_2754'>one of them, and speak that which is good.</a>
<a id='line_2755'></a>
<a id='line_2756'>22:14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto</a>
<a id='line_2757'>me, that will I speak.</a>
<a id='line_2758'></a>
<a id='line_2759'>22:15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,</a>
<a id='line_2760'>shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And</a>
<a id='line_2761'>he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into</a>
<a id='line_2762'>the hand of the king.</a>
<a id='line_2763'></a>
<a id='line_2764'>22:16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee</a>
<a id='line_2765'>that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2766'>LORD?  22:17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills,</a>
<a id='line_2767'>as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no</a>
<a id='line_2768'>master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</a>
<a id='line_2769'></a>
<a id='line_2770'>22:18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell</a>
<a id='line_2771'>thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?  22:19</a>
<a id='line_2772'>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2773'>sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on</a>
<a id='line_2774'>his right hand and on his left.</a>
<a id='line_2775'></a>
<a id='line_2776'>22:20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up</a>
<a id='line_2777'>and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another</a>
<a id='line_2778'>said on that manner.</a>
<a id='line_2779'></a>
<a id='line_2780'>22:21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_2781'>said, I will persuade him.</a>
<a id='line_2782'></a>
<a id='line_2783'>22:22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go</a>
<a id='line_2784'>forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</a>
<a id='line_2785'>And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and</a>
<a id='line_2786'>do so.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>22:23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the</a>
<a id='line_2789'>mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil</a>
<a id='line_2790'>concerning thee.</a>
<a id='line_2791'></a>
<a id='line_2792'>22:24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah</a>
<a id='line_2793'>on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me</a>
<a id='line_2794'>to speak unto thee?  22:25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in</a>
<a id='line_2795'>that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</a>
<a id='line_2796'></a>
<a id='line_2797'>22:26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back</a>
<a id='line_2798'>unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 22:27</a>
<a id='line_2799'>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed</a>
<a id='line_2800'>him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I</a>
<a id='line_2801'>come in peace.</a>
<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>22:28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_2804'>not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</a>
<a id='line_2805'></a>
<a id='line_2806'>22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up</a>
<a id='line_2807'>to Ramothgilead.</a>
<a id='line_2808'></a>
<a id='line_2809'>22:30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise</a>
<a id='line_2810'>myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the</a>
<a id='line_2811'>king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</a>
<a id='line_2812'></a>
<a id='line_2813'>22:31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that</a>
<a id='line_2814'>had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor</a>
<a id='line_2815'>great, save only with the king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2816'></a>
<a id='line_2817'>22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw</a>
<a id='line_2818'>Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they</a>
<a id='line_2819'>turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</a>
<a id='line_2820'></a>
<a id='line_2821'>22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived</a>
<a id='line_2822'>that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from</a>
<a id='line_2823'>pursuing him.</a>
<a id='line_2824'></a>
<a id='line_2825'>22:34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of</a>
<a id='line_2826'>Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the</a>
<a id='line_2827'>driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host;</a>
<a id='line_2828'>for I am wounded.</a>
<a id='line_2829'></a>
<a id='line_2830'>22:35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in</a>
<a id='line_2831'>his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran</a>
<a id='line_2832'>out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</a>
<a id='line_2833'></a>
<a id='line_2834'>22:36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the</a>
<a id='line_2835'>going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to</a>
<a id='line_2836'>his own country.</a>
<a id='line_2837'></a>
<a id='line_2838'>22:37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried</a>
<a id='line_2839'>the king in Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_2840'></a>
<a id='line_2841'>22:38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs</a>
<a id='line_2842'>licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the</a>
<a id='line_2843'>word of the LORD which he spake.</a>
<a id='line_2844'></a>
<a id='line_2845'>22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the</a>
<a id='line_2846'>ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they</a>
<a id='line_2847'>not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</a>
<a id='line_2848'>22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in</a>
<a id='line_2849'>his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2850'></a>
<a id='line_2851'>22:41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the</a>
<a id='line_2852'>fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2853'></a>
<a id='line_2854'>22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to</a>
<a id='line_2855'>reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his</a>
<a id='line_2856'>mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</a>
<a id='line_2857'></a>
<a id='line_2858'>22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not</a>
<a id='line_2859'>aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_2860'>nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people</a>
<a id='line_2861'>offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</a>
<a id='line_2862'></a>
<a id='line_2863'>22:44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2864'></a>
<a id='line_2865'>22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he</a>
<a id='line_2866'>shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the</a>
<a id='line_2867'>chronicles of the kings of Judah?  22:46 And the remnant of the</a>
<a id='line_2868'>sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out</a>
<a id='line_2869'>of the land.</a>
<a id='line_2870'></a>
<a id='line_2871'>22:47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</a>
<a id='line_2872'></a>
<a id='line_2873'>22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but</a>
<a id='line_2874'>they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</a>
<a id='line_2875'></a>
<a id='line_2876'>22:49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my</a>
<a id='line_2877'>servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</a>
<a id='line_2878'></a>
<a id='line_2879'>22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his</a>
<a id='line_2880'>fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned</a>
<a id='line_2881'>in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_2882'></a>
<a id='line_2883'>22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria</a>
<a id='line_2884'>the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two</a>
<a id='line_2885'>years over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2886'></a>
<a id='line_2887'>22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way</a>
<a id='line_2888'>of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of</a>
<a id='line_2889'>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 22:53 For he served</a>
<a id='line_2890'>Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_2891'>Israel, according to all that his father had done.</a>

<a id='line_2896'>The Second Book of the Kings</a>
<a id='line_2897'></a>
<a id='line_2898'>Commonly Called:</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>
<a id='line_2900'>The Fourth Book of the Kings</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'></a>
<a id='line_2903'>1:1 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</a>
<a id='line_2904'></a>
<a id='line_2905'>1:2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that</a>
<a id='line_2906'>was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2907'>them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall</a>
<a id='line_2908'>recover of this disease.</a>
<a id='line_2909'></a>
<a id='line_2910'>1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go</a>
<a id='line_2911'>up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,</a>
<a id='line_2912'>Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire</a>
<a id='line_2913'>of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?  1:4 Now therefore thus saith the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2914'>Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but</a>
<a id='line_2915'>shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</a>
<a id='line_2916'></a>
<a id='line_2917'>1:5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_2918'>Why are ye now turned back?  1:6 And they said unto him, There came a</a>
<a id='line_2919'>man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that</a>
<a id='line_2920'>sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because</a>
<a id='line_2921'>there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of</a>
<a id='line_2922'>Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from</a>
<a id='line_2923'>that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</a>
<a id='line_2924'></a>
<a id='line_2925'>1:7 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to</a>
<a id='line_2926'>meet you, and told you these words?  1:8 And they answered him, He was</a>
<a id='line_2927'>an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And</a>
<a id='line_2928'>he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</a>
<a id='line_2929'></a>
<a id='line_2930'>1:9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And</a>
<a id='line_2931'>he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he</a>
<a id='line_2932'>spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</a>
<a id='line_2933'></a>
<a id='line_2934'>1:10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a</a>
<a id='line_2935'>man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and</a>
<a id='line_2936'>thy fifty.</a>
<a id='line_2937'></a>
<a id='line_2938'>And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</a>
<a id='line_2939'></a>
<a id='line_2940'>1:11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his</a>
<a id='line_2941'>fifty.</a>
<a id='line_2942'></a>
<a id='line_2943'>And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king</a>
<a id='line_2944'>said, Come down quickly.</a>
<a id='line_2945'></a>
<a id='line_2946'>1:12 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let</a>
<a id='line_2947'>fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the</a>
<a id='line_2948'>fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</a>
<a id='line_2949'></a>
<a id='line_2950'>1:13 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.</a>
<a id='line_2951'>And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees</a>
<a id='line_2952'>before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I</a>
<a id='line_2953'>pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be</a>
<a id='line_2954'>precious in thy sight.</a>
<a id='line_2955'></a>
<a id='line_2956'>1:14 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two</a>
<a id='line_2957'>captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my</a>
<a id='line_2958'>life now be precious in thy sight.</a>
<a id='line_2959'></a>
<a id='line_2960'>1:15 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be</a>
<a id='line_2961'>not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</a>
<a id='line_2962'></a>
<a id='line_2963'>1:16 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2964'>sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not</a>
<a id='line_2965'>because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore</a>
<a id='line_2966'>thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but</a>
<a id='line_2967'>shalt surely die.</a>
<a id='line_2968'></a>
<a id='line_2969'>1:17 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had</a>
<a id='line_2970'>spoken.</a>
<a id='line_2971'></a>
<a id='line_2972'>And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son</a>
<a id='line_2973'>of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</a>
<a id='line_2974'></a>
<a id='line_2975'>1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not</a>
<a id='line_2976'>written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  2:1 And</a>
<a id='line_2977'>it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a</a>
<a id='line_2978'>whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_2979'></a>
<a id='line_2980'>2:2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2981'>hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth,</a>
<a id='line_2982'>and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to</a>
<a id='line_2983'>Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_2984'></a>
<a id='line_2985'>2:3 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to</a>
<a id='line_2986'>Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away</a>
<a id='line_2987'>thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye</a>
<a id='line_2988'>your peace.</a>
<a id='line_2989'></a>
<a id='line_2990'>2:4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the</a>
<a id='line_2991'>LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as</a>
<a id='line_2992'>thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_2993'></a>
<a id='line_2994'>2:5 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,</a>
<a id='line_2995'>and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy</a>
<a id='line_2996'>master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye</a>
<a id='line_2997'>your peace.</a>
<a id='line_2998'></a>
<a id='line_2999'>2:6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3000'>hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy</a>
<a id='line_3001'>soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</a>
<a id='line_3002'></a>
<a id='line_3003'>2:7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view</a>
<a id='line_3004'>afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_3005'></a>
<a id='line_3006'>2:8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the</a>
<a id='line_3007'>waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two</a>
<a id='line_3008'>went over on dry ground.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>2:9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said</a>
<a id='line_3011'>unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from</a>
<a id='line_3012'>thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit</a>
<a id='line_3013'>be upon me.</a>
<a id='line_3014'></a>
<a id='line_3015'>2:10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou</a>
<a id='line_3016'>see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if</a>
<a id='line_3017'>not, it shall not be so.</a>
<a id='line_3018'></a>
<a id='line_3019'>2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,</a>
<a id='line_3020'>behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and</a>
<a id='line_3021'>parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into</a>
<a id='line_3022'>heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3023'></a>
<a id='line_3024'>2:12 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the</a>
<a id='line_3025'>chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more:</a>
<a id='line_3026'>and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</a>
<a id='line_3027'></a>
<a id='line_3028'>2:13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went</a>
<a id='line_3029'>back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 2:14 And he took the mantle of</a>
<a id='line_3030'>Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is</a>
<a id='line_3031'>the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they</a>
<a id='line_3032'>parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</a>
<a id='line_3033'></a>
<a id='line_3034'>2:15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho</a>
<a id='line_3035'>saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they</a>
<a id='line_3036'>came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</a>
<a id='line_3037'></a>
<a id='line_3038'>2:16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants</a>
<a id='line_3039'>fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest</a>
<a id='line_3040'>peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him</a>
<a id='line_3041'>upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_3042'>send.</a>
<a id='line_3043'></a>
<a id='line_3044'>2:17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They</a>
<a id='line_3045'>sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him</a>
<a id='line_3046'>not.</a>
<a id='line_3047'></a>
<a id='line_3048'>2:18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he</a>
<a id='line_3049'>said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?  2:19 And the men of</a>
<a id='line_3050'>the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this</a>
<a id='line_3051'>city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the</a>
<a id='line_3052'>ground barren.</a>
<a id='line_3053'></a>
<a id='line_3054'>2:20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they</a>
<a id='line_3055'>brought it to him.</a>
<a id='line_3056'></a>
<a id='line_3057'>2:21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the</a>
<a id='line_3058'>salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these</a>
<a id='line_3059'>waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</a>
<a id='line_3060'></a>
<a id='line_3061'>2:22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying</a>
<a id='line_3062'>of Elisha which he spake.</a>
<a id='line_3063'></a>
<a id='line_3064'>2:23 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by</a>
<a id='line_3065'>the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked</a>
<a id='line_3066'>him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</a>
<a id='line_3067'></a>
<a id='line_3068'>2:24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the</a>
<a id='line_3069'>name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3070'>and tare forty and two children of them.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>2:25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he</a>
<a id='line_3073'>returned to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_3074'></a>
<a id='line_3075'>3:1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria</a>
<a id='line_3076'>the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve</a>
<a id='line_3077'>years.</a>
<a id='line_3078'></a>
<a id='line_3079'>3:2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his</a>
<a id='line_3080'>father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that</a>
<a id='line_3081'>his father had made.</a>
<a id='line_3082'></a>
<a id='line_3083'>3:3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of</a>
<a id='line_3084'>Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</a>
<a id='line_3085'></a>
<a id='line_3086'>3:4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the</a>
<a id='line_3087'>king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_3088'>rams, with the wool.</a>
<a id='line_3089'></a>
<a id='line_3090'>3:5 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab</a>
<a id='line_3091'>rebelled against the king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3092'></a>
<a id='line_3093'>3:6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered</a>
<a id='line_3094'>all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>3:7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_3097'>king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against</a>
<a id='line_3098'>Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people</a>
<a id='line_3099'>as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</a>
<a id='line_3100'></a>
<a id='line_3101'>3:8 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way</a>
<a id='line_3102'>through the wilderness of Edom.</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>3:9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of</a>
<a id='line_3105'>Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was</a>
<a id='line_3106'>no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</a>
<a id='line_3107'></a>
<a id='line_3108'>3:10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called</a>
<a id='line_3109'>these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</a>
<a id='line_3110'>3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_3111'>that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of</a>
<a id='line_3112'>Israel’s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of</a>
<a id='line_3113'>Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</a>
<a id='line_3114'></a>
<a id='line_3115'>3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the</a>
<a id='line_3116'>king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</a>
<a id='line_3117'></a>
<a id='line_3118'>3:13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with</a>
<a id='line_3119'>thee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of</a>
<a id='line_3120'>thy mother.</a>
<a id='line_3121'></a>
<a id='line_3122'>And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called</a>
<a id='line_3123'>these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_3124'></a>
<a id='line_3125'>3:14 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I</a>
<a id='line_3126'>stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat</a>
<a id='line_3127'>the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</a>
<a id='line_3128'></a>
<a id='line_3129'>3:15 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the</a>
<a id='line_3130'>minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</a>
<a id='line_3131'></a>
<a id='line_3132'>3:16 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of</a>
<a id='line_3133'>ditches.</a>
<a id='line_3134'></a>
<a id='line_3135'>3:17 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye</a>
<a id='line_3136'>see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may</a>
<a id='line_3137'>drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</a>
<a id='line_3138'></a>
<a id='line_3139'>3:18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will</a>
<a id='line_3140'>deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</a>
<a id='line_3141'></a>
<a id='line_3142'>3:19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and</a>
<a id='line_3143'>shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every</a>
<a id='line_3144'>good piece of land with stones.</a>
<a id='line_3145'></a>
<a id='line_3146'>3:20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was</a>
<a id='line_3147'>offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the</a>
<a id='line_3148'>country was filled with water.</a>
<a id='line_3149'></a>
<a id='line_3150'>3:21 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to</a>
<a id='line_3151'>fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour,</a>
<a id='line_3152'>and upward, and stood in the border.</a>
<a id='line_3153'></a>
<a id='line_3154'>3:22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the</a>
<a id='line_3155'>water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as</a>
<a id='line_3156'>blood: 3:23 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain,</a>
<a id='line_3157'>and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</a>
<a id='line_3158'></a>
<a id='line_3159'>3:24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up</a>
<a id='line_3160'>and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went</a>
<a id='line_3161'>forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</a>
<a id='line_3162'></a>
<a id='line_3163'>3:25 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land</a>
<a id='line_3164'>cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the</a>
<a id='line_3165'>wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth</a>
<a id='line_3166'>left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and</a>
<a id='line_3167'>smote it.</a>
<a id='line_3168'></a>
<a id='line_3169'>3:26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for</a>
<a id='line_3170'>him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break</a>
<a id='line_3171'>through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</a>
<a id='line_3172'></a>
<a id='line_3173'>3:27 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his</a>
<a id='line_3174'>stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there</a>
<a id='line_3175'>was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and</a>
<a id='line_3176'>returned to their own land.</a>
<a id='line_3177'></a>
<a id='line_3178'>4:1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the</a>
<a id='line_3179'>prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou</a>
<a id='line_3180'>knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come</a>
<a id='line_3181'>to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</a>
<a id='line_3182'></a>
<a id='line_3183'>4:2 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what</a>
<a id='line_3184'>hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any</a>
<a id='line_3185'>thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</a>
<a id='line_3186'></a>
<a id='line_3187'>4:3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy</a>
<a id='line_3188'>neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</a>
<a id='line_3189'></a>
<a id='line_3190'>4:4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and</a>
<a id='line_3191'>upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou</a>
<a id='line_3192'>shalt set aside that which is full.</a>
<a id='line_3193'></a>
<a id='line_3194'>4:5 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her</a>
<a id='line_3195'>sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</a>
<a id='line_3196'></a>
<a id='line_3197'>4:6 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said</a>
<a id='line_3198'>unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is</a>
<a id='line_3199'>not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</a>
<a id='line_3200'></a>
<a id='line_3201'>4:7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the</a>
<a id='line_3202'>oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</a>
<a id='line_3203'></a>
<a id='line_3204'>4:8 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a</a>
<a id='line_3205'>great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that</a>
<a id='line_3206'>as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'>4:9 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is</a>
<a id='line_3209'>an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</a>
<a id='line_3210'></a>
<a id='line_3211'>4:10 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let</a>
<a id='line_3212'>us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a</a>
<a id='line_3213'>candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn</a>
<a id='line_3214'>in thither.</a>
<a id='line_3215'></a>
<a id='line_3216'>4:11 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into</a>
<a id='line_3217'>the chamber, and lay there.</a>
<a id='line_3218'></a>
<a id='line_3219'>4:12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when</a>
<a id='line_3220'>he had called her, she stood before him.</a>
<a id='line_3221'></a>
<a id='line_3222'>4:13 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been</a>
<a id='line_3223'>careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?</a>
<a id='line_3224'>wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the</a>
<a id='line_3225'>host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</a>
<a id='line_3226'></a>
<a id='line_3227'>4:14 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi</a>
<a id='line_3228'>answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</a>
<a id='line_3229'></a>
<a id='line_3230'>4:15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in</a>
<a id='line_3231'>the door.</a>
<a id='line_3232'></a>
<a id='line_3233'>4:16 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,</a>
<a id='line_3234'>thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God,</a>
<a id='line_3235'>do not lie unto thine handmaid.</a>
<a id='line_3236'></a>
<a id='line_3237'>4:17 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that</a>
<a id='line_3238'>Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</a>
<a id='line_3239'></a>
<a id='line_3240'>4:18 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out</a>
<a id='line_3241'>to his father to the reapers.</a>
<a id='line_3242'></a>
<a id='line_3243'>4:19 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a</a>
<a id='line_3244'>lad, Carry him to his mother.</a>
<a id='line_3245'></a>
<a id='line_3246'>4:20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat</a>
<a id='line_3247'>on her knees till noon, and then died.</a>
<a id='line_3248'></a>
<a id='line_3249'>4:21 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and</a>
<a id='line_3250'>shut the door upon him, and went out.</a>
<a id='line_3251'></a>
<a id='line_3252'>4:22 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_3253'>one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man</a>
<a id='line_3254'>of God, and come again.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'>4:23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither</a>
<a id='line_3257'>new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</a>
<a id='line_3258'></a>
<a id='line_3259'>4:24 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go</a>
<a id='line_3260'>forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</a>
<a id='line_3261'></a>
<a id='line_3262'>4:25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it</a>
<a id='line_3263'>came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to</a>
<a id='line_3264'>Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: 4:26 Run now, I</a>
<a id='line_3265'>pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it</a>
<a id='line_3266'>well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It</a>
<a id='line_3267'>is well: 4:27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she</a>
<a id='line_3268'>caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And</a>
<a id='line_3269'>the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her:</a>
<a id='line_3270'>and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</a>
<a id='line_3271'></a>
<a id='line_3272'>4:28 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do</a>
<a id='line_3273'>not deceive me?  4:29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and</a>
<a id='line_3274'>take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay</a>
<a id='line_3276'>my staff upon the face of the child.</a>
<a id='line_3277'></a>
<a id='line_3278'>4:30 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy</a>
<a id='line_3279'>soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</a>
<a id='line_3280'></a>
<a id='line_3281'>4:31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the</a>
<a id='line_3282'>face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_3283'>he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not</a>
<a id='line_3284'>awaked.</a>
<a id='line_3285'></a>
<a id='line_3286'>4:32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was</a>
<a id='line_3287'>dead, and laid upon his bed.</a>
<a id='line_3288'></a>
<a id='line_3289'>4:33 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and</a>
<a id='line_3290'>prayed unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3291'></a>
<a id='line_3292'>4:34 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon</a>
<a id='line_3293'>his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands:</a>
<a id='line_3294'>and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed</a>
<a id='line_3295'>warm.</a>
<a id='line_3296'></a>
<a id='line_3297'>4:35 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went</a>
<a id='line_3298'>up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times,</a>
<a id='line_3299'>and the child opened his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3300'></a>
<a id='line_3301'>4:36 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he</a>
<a id='line_3302'>called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy</a>
<a id='line_3303'>son.</a>
<a id='line_3304'></a>
<a id='line_3305'>4:37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the</a>
<a id='line_3306'>ground, and took up her son, and went out.</a>
<a id='line_3307'></a>
<a id='line_3308'>4:38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the</a>
<a id='line_3309'>land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he</a>
<a id='line_3310'>said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for</a>
<a id='line_3311'>the sons of the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_3312'></a>
<a id='line_3313'>4:39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild</a>
<a id='line_3314'>vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and</a>
<a id='line_3315'>shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.</a>
<a id='line_3316'></a>
<a id='line_3317'>4:40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as</a>
<a id='line_3318'>they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou</a>
<a id='line_3319'>man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3320'></a>
<a id='line_3321'>4:41 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he</a>
<a id='line_3322'>said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no</a>
<a id='line_3323'>harm in the pot.</a>
<a id='line_3324'></a>
<a id='line_3325'>4:42 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of</a>
<a id='line_3326'>God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears</a>
<a id='line_3327'>of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that</a>
<a id='line_3328'>they may eat.</a>
<a id='line_3329'></a>
<a id='line_3330'>4:43 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred</a>
<a id='line_3331'>men?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus</a>
<a id='line_3332'>saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3333'></a>
<a id='line_3334'>4:44 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,</a>
<a id='line_3335'>according to the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3336'></a>
<a id='line_3337'>5:1 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great</a>
<a id='line_3338'>man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given</a>
<a id='line_3339'>deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was</a>
<a id='line_3340'>a leper.</a>
<a id='line_3341'></a>
<a id='line_3342'>5:2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away</a>
<a id='line_3343'>captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on</a>
<a id='line_3344'>Naaman’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_3345'></a>
<a id='line_3346'>5:3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the</a>
<a id='line_3347'>prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.</a>
<a id='line_3348'></a>
<a id='line_3349'>5:4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the</a>
<a id='line_3350'>maid that is of the land of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3351'></a>
<a id='line_3352'>5:5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter</a>
<a id='line_3353'>unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten</a>
<a id='line_3354'>talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of</a>
<a id='line_3355'>raiment.</a>
<a id='line_3356'></a>
<a id='line_3357'>5:6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when</a>
<a id='line_3358'>this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my</a>
<a id='line_3359'>servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</a>
<a id='line_3360'></a>
<a id='line_3361'>5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,</a>
<a id='line_3362'>that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make</a>
<a id='line_3363'>alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his</a>
<a id='line_3364'>leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a</a>
<a id='line_3365'>quarrel against me.</a>
<a id='line_3366'></a>
<a id='line_3367'>5:8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king</a>
<a id='line_3368'>of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,</a>
<a id='line_3369'>Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he</a>
<a id='line_3370'>shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3371'></a>
<a id='line_3372'>5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at</a>
<a id='line_3373'>the door of the house of Elisha.</a>
<a id='line_3374'></a>
<a id='line_3375'>5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in</a>
<a id='line_3376'>Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou</a>
<a id='line_3377'>shalt be clean.</a>
<a id='line_3378'></a>
<a id='line_3379'>5:11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,</a>
<a id='line_3380'>He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the</a>
<a id='line_3381'>LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the</a>
<a id='line_3382'>leper.</a>
<a id='line_3383'></a>
<a id='line_3384'>5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all</a>
<a id='line_3385'>the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he</a>
<a id='line_3386'>turned and went away in a rage.</a>
<a id='line_3387'></a>
<a id='line_3388'>5:13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My</a>
<a id='line_3389'>father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou</a>
<a id='line_3390'>not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash,</a>
<a id='line_3391'>and be clean?  5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times</a>
<a id='line_3392'>in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh</a>
<a id='line_3393'>came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</a>
<a id='line_3394'></a>
<a id='line_3395'>5:15 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and</a>
<a id='line_3396'>came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there</a>
<a id='line_3397'>is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>take a blessing of thy servant.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>5:16 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will</a>
<a id='line_3401'>receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</a>
<a id='line_3402'></a>
<a id='line_3403'>5:17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to</a>
<a id='line_3404'>thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will</a>
<a id='line_3405'>henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods,</a>
<a id='line_3406'>but unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3407'></a>
<a id='line_3408'>5:18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master</a>
<a id='line_3409'>goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my</a>
<a id='line_3410'>hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself</a>
<a id='line_3411'>in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</a>
<a id='line_3412'></a>
<a id='line_3413'>5:19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a</a>
<a id='line_3414'>little way.</a>
<a id='line_3415'></a>
<a id='line_3416'>5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_3417'>my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his</a>
<a id='line_3418'>hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after</a>
<a id='line_3419'>him, and take somewhat of him.</a>
<a id='line_3420'></a>
<a id='line_3421'>5:21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running</a>
<a id='line_3422'>after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is</a>
<a id='line_3423'>all well?  5:22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me,</a>
<a id='line_3424'>saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two</a>
<a id='line_3425'>young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a</a>
<a id='line_3426'>talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</a>
<a id='line_3427'></a>
<a id='line_3428'>5:23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,</a>
<a id='line_3429'>and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of</a>
<a id='line_3430'>garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them</a>
<a id='line_3431'>before him.</a>
<a id='line_3432'></a>
<a id='line_3433'>5:24 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and</a>
<a id='line_3434'>bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.</a>
<a id='line_3435'></a>
<a id='line_3436'>5:25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto</a>
<a id='line_3437'>him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no</a>
<a id='line_3438'>whither.</a>
<a id='line_3439'></a>
<a id='line_3440'>5:26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man</a>
<a id='line_3441'>turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive</a>
<a id='line_3442'>money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and</a>
<a id='line_3443'>sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?  5:27 The leprosy</a>
<a id='line_3444'>therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for</a>
<a id='line_3445'>ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</a>
<a id='line_3446'></a>
<a id='line_3447'>6:1 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the</a>
<a id='line_3448'>place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.</a>
<a id='line_3449'></a>
<a id='line_3450'>6:2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a</a>
<a id='line_3451'>beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he</a>
<a id='line_3452'>answered, Go ye.</a>
<a id='line_3453'></a>
<a id='line_3454'>6:3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.</a>
<a id='line_3455'>And he answered, I will go.</a>
<a id='line_3456'></a>
<a id='line_3457'>6:4 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down</a>
<a id='line_3458'>wood.</a>
<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>6:5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:</a>
<a id='line_3461'>and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.</a>
<a id='line_3462'></a>
<a id='line_3463'>6:6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the</a>
<a id='line_3464'>place.</a>
<a id='line_3465'></a>
<a id='line_3466'>And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did</a>
<a id='line_3467'>swim.</a>
<a id='line_3468'></a>
<a id='line_3469'>6:7 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,</a>
<a id='line_3470'>and took it.</a>
<a id='line_3471'></a>
<a id='line_3472'>6:8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel</a>
<a id='line_3473'>with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</a>
<a id='line_3474'></a>
<a id='line_3475'>6:9 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware</a>
<a id='line_3476'>that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come</a>
<a id='line_3477'>down.</a>
<a id='line_3478'></a>
<a id='line_3479'>6:10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God</a>
<a id='line_3480'>told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor</a>
<a id='line_3481'>twice.</a>
<a id='line_3482'></a>
<a id='line_3483'>6:11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for</a>
<a id='line_3484'>this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye</a>
<a id='line_3485'>not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?  6:12 And one of</a>
<a id='line_3486'>his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that</a>
<a id='line_3487'>is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest</a>
<a id='line_3488'>in thy bedchamber.</a>
<a id='line_3489'></a>
<a id='line_3490'>6:13 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch</a>
<a id='line_3491'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3492'></a>
<a id='line_3493'>And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</a>
<a id='line_3494'></a>
<a id='line_3495'>6:14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:</a>
<a id='line_3496'>and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</a>
<a id='line_3497'></a>
<a id='line_3498'>6:15 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone</a>
<a id='line_3499'>forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and</a>
<a id='line_3500'>chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we</a>
<a id='line_3501'>do?  6:16 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more</a>
<a id='line_3502'>than they that be with them.</a>
<a id='line_3503'></a>
<a id='line_3504'>6:17 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3505'>that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he</a>
<a id='line_3506'>saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire</a>
<a id='line_3507'>round about Elisha.</a>
<a id='line_3508'></a>
<a id='line_3509'>6:18 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_3510'>said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote</a>
<a id='line_3511'>them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</a>
<a id='line_3512'></a>
<a id='line_3513'>6:19 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this</a>
<a id='line_3514'>the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But</a>
<a id='line_3515'>he led them to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_3516'></a>
<a id='line_3517'>6:20 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that</a>
<a id='line_3518'>Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And</a>
<a id='line_3519'>the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in</a>
<a id='line_3520'>the midst of Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_3521'></a>
<a id='line_3522'>6:21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My</a>
<a id='line_3523'>father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?  6:22 And he answered,</a>
<a id='line_3524'>Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3525'>taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water</a>
<a id='line_3526'>before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</a>
<a id='line_3527'></a>
<a id='line_3528'>6:23 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten</a>
<a id='line_3529'>and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the</a>
<a id='line_3530'>bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3531'></a>
<a id='line_3532'>6:24 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria</a>
<a id='line_3533'>gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_3534'></a>
<a id='line_3535'>6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they</a>
<a id='line_3536'>besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of</a>
<a id='line_3537'>silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of</a>
<a id='line_3538'>silver.</a>
<a id='line_3539'></a>
<a id='line_3540'>6:26 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there</a>
<a id='line_3541'>cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.</a>
<a id='line_3542'></a>
<a id='line_3543'>6:27 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help</a>
<a id='line_3544'>thee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  6:28 And the</a>
<a id='line_3545'>king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman</a>
<a id='line_3546'>said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will</a>
<a id='line_3547'>eat my son to morrow.</a>
<a id='line_3548'></a>
<a id='line_3549'>6:29 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the</a>
<a id='line_3550'>next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>6:30 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,</a>
<a id='line_3553'>that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the</a>
<a id='line_3554'>people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.</a>
<a id='line_3555'></a>
<a id='line_3556'>6:31 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of</a>
<a id='line_3557'>Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.</a>
<a id='line_3558'></a>
<a id='line_3559'>6:32 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the</a>
<a id='line_3560'>king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he</a>
<a id='line_3561'>said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to</a>
<a id='line_3562'>take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door,</a>
<a id='line_3563'>and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master’s feet</a>
<a id='line_3564'>behind him?  6:33 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the</a>
<a id='line_3565'>messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the</a>
<a id='line_3566'>LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?  7:1 Then Elisha</a>
<a id='line_3567'>said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow</a>
<a id='line_3568'>about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel,</a>
<a id='line_3569'>and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_3570'></a>
<a id='line_3571'>7:2 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,</a>
<a id='line_3572'>and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this</a>
<a id='line_3573'>thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but</a>
<a id='line_3574'>shalt not eat thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3575'></a>
<a id='line_3576'>7:3 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:</a>
<a id='line_3577'>and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?  7:4 If we</a>
<a id='line_3578'>say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and</a>
<a id='line_3579'>we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now</a>
<a id='line_3580'>therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they</a>
<a id='line_3581'>save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.</a>
<a id='line_3582'></a>
<a id='line_3583'>7:5 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the</a>
<a id='line_3584'>Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of</a>
<a id='line_3585'>Syria, behold, there was no man there.</a>
<a id='line_3586'></a>
<a id='line_3587'>7:6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of</a>
<a id='line_3588'>chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and</a>
<a id='line_3589'>they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us</a>
<a id='line_3590'>the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come</a>
<a id='line_3591'>upon us.</a>
<a id='line_3592'></a>
<a id='line_3593'>7:7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their</a>
<a id='line_3594'>tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and</a>
<a id='line_3595'>fled for their life.</a>
<a id='line_3596'></a>
<a id='line_3597'>7:8 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they</a>
<a id='line_3598'>went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver,</a>
<a id='line_3599'>and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and</a>
<a id='line_3600'>entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid</a>
<a id='line_3601'>it.</a>
<a id='line_3602'></a>
<a id='line_3603'>7:9 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day</a>
<a id='line_3604'>of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning</a>
<a id='line_3605'>light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we</a>
<a id='line_3606'>may go and tell the king’s household.</a>
<a id='line_3607'></a>
<a id='line_3608'>7:10 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they</a>
<a id='line_3609'>told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_3610'>there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and</a>
<a id='line_3611'>asses tied, and the tents as they were.</a>
<a id='line_3612'></a>
<a id='line_3613'>7:11 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s house</a>
<a id='line_3614'>within.</a>
<a id='line_3615'></a>
<a id='line_3616'>7:12 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I</a>
<a id='line_3617'>will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we</a>
<a id='line_3618'>be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves</a>
<a id='line_3619'>in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch</a>
<a id='line_3620'>them alive, and get into the city.</a>
<a id='line_3621'></a>
<a id='line_3622'>7:13 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray</a>
<a id='line_3623'>thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city,</a>
<a id='line_3624'>(behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it:</a>
<a id='line_3625'>behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites</a>
<a id='line_3626'>that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</a>
<a id='line_3627'></a>
<a id='line_3628'>7:14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after</a>
<a id='line_3629'>the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</a>
<a id='line_3630'></a>
<a id='line_3631'>7:15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was</a>
<a id='line_3632'>full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their</a>
<a id='line_3633'>haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.</a>
<a id='line_3634'></a>
<a id='line_3635'>7:16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So</a>
<a id='line_3636'>a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of</a>
<a id='line_3637'>barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3638'></a>
<a id='line_3639'>7:17 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have</a>
<a id='line_3640'>the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and</a>
<a id='line_3641'>he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down</a>
<a id='line_3642'>to him.</a>
<a id='line_3643'></a>
<a id='line_3644'>7:18 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,</a>
<a id='line_3645'>saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine</a>
<a id='line_3646'>flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of</a>
<a id='line_3647'>Samaria: 7:19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now,</a>
<a id='line_3648'>behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing</a>
<a id='line_3649'>be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt</a>
<a id='line_3650'>not eat thereof.</a>
<a id='line_3651'></a>
<a id='line_3652'>7:20 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the</a>
<a id='line_3653'>gate, and he died.</a>
<a id='line_3654'></a>
<a id='line_3655'>8:1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to</a>
<a id='line_3656'>life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn</a>
<a id='line_3657'>wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine;</a>
<a id='line_3658'>and it shall also come upon the land seven years.</a>
<a id='line_3659'></a>
<a id='line_3660'>8:2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:</a>
<a id='line_3661'>and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the</a>
<a id='line_3662'>Philistines seven years.</a>
<a id='line_3663'></a>
<a id='line_3664'>8:3 And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman</a>
<a id='line_3665'>returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry</a>
<a id='line_3666'>unto the king for her house and for her land.</a>
<a id='line_3667'></a>
<a id='line_3668'>8:4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,</a>
<a id='line_3669'>saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath</a>
<a id='line_3670'>done.</a>
<a id='line_3671'></a>
<a id='line_3672'>8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had</a>
<a id='line_3673'>restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he</a>
<a id='line_3674'>had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her</a>
<a id='line_3675'>land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is</a>
<a id='line_3676'>her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</a>
<a id='line_3677'></a>
<a id='line_3678'>8:6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king</a>
<a id='line_3679'>appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was</a>
<a id='line_3680'>hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the</a>
<a id='line_3681'>land, even until now.</a>
<a id='line_3682'></a>
<a id='line_3683'>8:7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was</a>
<a id='line_3684'>sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</a>
<a id='line_3685'></a>
<a id='line_3686'>8:8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and</a>
<a id='line_3687'>go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall</a>
<a id='line_3688'>I recover of this disease?  8:9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a</a>
<a id='line_3689'>present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’</a>
<a id='line_3690'>burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king</a>
<a id='line_3691'>of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this</a>
<a id='line_3692'>disease?  8:10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_3693'>certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall</a>
<a id='line_3694'>surely die.</a>
<a id='line_3695'></a>
<a id='line_3696'>8:11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:</a>
<a id='line_3697'>and the man of God wept.</a>
<a id='line_3698'></a>
<a id='line_3699'>8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I</a>
<a id='line_3700'>know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their</a>
<a id='line_3701'>strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay</a>
<a id='line_3702'>with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women</a>
<a id='line_3703'>with child.</a>
<a id='line_3704'></a>
<a id='line_3705'>8:13 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should</a>
<a id='line_3706'>do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that</a>
<a id='line_3707'>thou shalt be king over Syria.</a>
<a id='line_3708'></a>
<a id='line_3709'>8:14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to</a>
<a id='line_3710'>him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou</a>
<a id='line_3711'>shouldest surely recover.</a>
<a id='line_3712'></a>
<a id='line_3713'>8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,</a>
<a id='line_3714'>and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died:</a>
<a id='line_3715'>and Hazael reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_3716'></a>
<a id='line_3717'>8:16 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_3718'>Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat</a>
<a id='line_3719'>king of Judah began to reign.</a>
<a id='line_3720'></a>
<a id='line_3721'>8:17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he</a>
<a id='line_3722'>reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_3723'></a>
<a id='line_3724'>8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house</a>
<a id='line_3725'>of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the</a>
<a id='line_3726'>sight of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3727'></a>
<a id='line_3728'>8:19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s</a>
<a id='line_3729'>sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his</a>
<a id='line_3730'>children.</a>
<a id='line_3731'></a>
<a id='line_3732'>8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made</a>
<a id='line_3733'>a king over themselves.</a>
<a id='line_3734'></a>
<a id='line_3735'>8:21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he</a>
<a id='line_3736'>rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and</a>
<a id='line_3737'>the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</a>
<a id='line_3738'></a>
<a id='line_3739'>8:22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_3740'>Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</a>
<a id='line_3741'></a>
<a id='line_3742'>8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they</a>
<a id='line_3743'>not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  8:24</a>
<a id='line_3744'>And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in</a>
<a id='line_3745'>the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_3746'></a>
<a id='line_3747'>8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did</a>
<a id='line_3748'>Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</a>
<a id='line_3749'></a>
<a id='line_3750'>8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and</a>
<a id='line_3751'>he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3753'></a>
<a id='line_3754'>8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in</a>
<a id='line_3755'>the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in</a>
<a id='line_3756'>law of the house of Ahab.</a>
<a id='line_3757'></a>
<a id='line_3758'>8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael</a>
<a id='line_3759'>king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</a>
<a id='line_3760'></a>
<a id='line_3761'>8:29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds</a>
<a id='line_3762'>which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against</a>
<a id='line_3763'>Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah</a>
<a id='line_3764'>went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was</a>
<a id='line_3765'>sick.</a>
<a id='line_3766'></a>
<a id='line_3767'>9:1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,</a>
<a id='line_3768'>and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in</a>
<a id='line_3769'>thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead: 9:2 And when thou comest thither,</a>
<a id='line_3770'>look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go</a>
<a id='line_3771'>in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an</a>
<a id='line_3772'>inner chamber; 9:3 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head,</a>
<a id='line_3773'>and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3774'>Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</a>
<a id='line_3775'></a>
<a id='line_3776'>9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to</a>
<a id='line_3777'>Ramothgilead.</a>
<a id='line_3778'></a>
<a id='line_3779'>9:5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;</a>
<a id='line_3780'>and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto</a>
<a id='line_3781'>which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</a>
<a id='line_3782'></a>
<a id='line_3783'>9:6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on</a>
<a id='line_3784'>his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have</a>
<a id='line_3785'>anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3786'></a>
<a id='line_3787'>9:7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may</a>
<a id='line_3788'>avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the</a>
<a id='line_3789'>servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</a>
<a id='line_3790'></a>
<a id='line_3791'>9:8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from</a>
<a id='line_3792'>Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and</a>
<a id='line_3793'>left in Israel: 9:9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house</a>
<a id='line_3794'>of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of</a>
<a id='line_3795'>Ahijah: 9:10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,</a>
<a id='line_3796'>and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_3797'></a>
<a id='line_3798'>9:11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said</a>
<a id='line_3799'>unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he</a>
<a id='line_3800'>said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</a>
<a id='line_3801'></a>
<a id='line_3802'>9:12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and</a>
<a id='line_3803'>thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee</a>
<a id='line_3804'>king over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3805'></a>
<a id='line_3806'>9:13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it</a>
<a id='line_3807'>under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying,</a>
<a id='line_3808'>Jehu is king.</a>
<a id='line_3809'></a>
<a id='line_3810'>9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired</a>
<a id='line_3811'>against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel,</a>
<a id='line_3812'>because of Hazael king of Syria.</a>
<a id='line_3813'></a>
<a id='line_3814'>9:15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds</a>
<a id='line_3815'>which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of</a>
<a id='line_3816'>Syria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth</a>
<a id='line_3817'>nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_3818'></a>
<a id='line_3819'>9:16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay</a>
<a id='line_3820'>there.</a>
<a id='line_3821'></a>
<a id='line_3822'>And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</a>
<a id='line_3823'></a>
<a id='line_3824'>9:17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied</a>
<a id='line_3825'>the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram</a>
<a id='line_3826'>said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it</a>
<a id='line_3827'>peace?  9:18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do</a>
<a id='line_3829'>with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_3830'>messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and</a>
<a id='line_3833'>said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast</a>
<a id='line_3834'>thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</a>
<a id='line_3835'></a>
<a id='line_3836'>9:20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh</a>
<a id='line_3837'>not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of</a>
<a id='line_3838'>Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</a>
<a id='line_3839'></a>
<a id='line_3840'>9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And</a>
<a id='line_3841'>Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his</a>
<a id='line_3842'>chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of</a>
<a id='line_3843'>Naboth the Jezreelite.</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it</a>
<a id='line_3846'>peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of</a>
<a id='line_3847'>thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?  9:23 And Joram</a>
<a id='line_3848'>turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O</a>
<a id='line_3849'>Ahaziah.</a>
<a id='line_3850'></a>
<a id='line_3851'>9:24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram</a>
<a id='line_3852'>between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk</a>
<a id='line_3853'>down in his chariot.</a>
<a id='line_3854'></a>
<a id='line_3855'>9:25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in</a>
<a id='line_3856'>the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how</a>
<a id='line_3857'>that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3858'>laid this burden upon him; 9:26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood</a>
<a id='line_3859'>of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will</a>
<a id='line_3860'>requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast</a>
<a id='line_3861'>him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3862'></a>
<a id='line_3863'>9:27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way</a>
<a id='line_3864'>of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him</a>
<a id='line_3865'>also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is</a>
<a id='line_3866'>by Ibleam.</a>
<a id='line_3867'></a>
<a id='line_3868'>And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</a>
<a id='line_3869'></a>
<a id='line_3870'>9:28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and</a>
<a id='line_3871'>buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</a>
<a id='line_3872'></a>
<a id='line_3873'>9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah</a>
<a id='line_3874'>to reign over Judah.</a>
<a id='line_3875'></a>
<a id='line_3876'>9:30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she</a>
<a id='line_3877'>painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</a>
<a id='line_3878'></a>
<a id='line_3879'>9:31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,</a>
<a id='line_3880'>who slew his master?  9:32 And he lifted up his face to the window,</a>
<a id='line_3881'>and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or</a>
<a id='line_3882'>three eunuchs.</a>
<a id='line_3883'></a>
<a id='line_3884'>9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of</a>
<a id='line_3885'>her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode</a>
<a id='line_3886'>her under foot.</a>
<a id='line_3887'></a>
<a id='line_3888'>9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see</a>
<a id='line_3889'>now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter.</a>
<a id='line_3890'></a>
<a id='line_3891'>9:35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the</a>
<a id='line_3892'>skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</a>
<a id='line_3893'></a>
<a id='line_3894'>9:36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the</a>
<a id='line_3895'>word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,</a>
<a id='line_3896'>saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</a>
<a id='line_3897'>9:37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the</a>
<a id='line_3898'>field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is</a>
<a id='line_3899'>Jezebel.</a>
<a id='line_3900'></a>
<a id='line_3901'>10:1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and</a>
<a id='line_3902'>sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to</a>
<a id='line_3903'>them that brought up Ahab’s children, saying, 10:2 Now as soon as this</a>
<a id='line_3904'>letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and</a>
<a id='line_3905'>there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and</a>
<a id='line_3906'>armour; 10:3 Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons,</a>
<a id='line_3907'>and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.</a>
<a id='line_3908'></a>
<a id='line_3909'>10:4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings</a>
<a id='line_3910'>stood not before him: how then shall we stand?  10:5 And he that was</a>
<a id='line_3911'>over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and</a>
<a id='line_3912'>the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy</a>
<a id='line_3913'>servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any</a>
<a id='line_3914'>king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_3915'></a>
<a id='line_3916'>10:6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be</a>
<a id='line_3917'>mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the</a>
<a id='line_3918'>men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this</a>
<a id='line_3919'>time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great</a>
<a id='line_3920'>men of the city, which brought them up.</a>
<a id='line_3921'></a>
<a id='line_3922'>10:7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took</a>
<a id='line_3923'>the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in</a>
<a id='line_3924'>baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_3925'></a>
<a id='line_3926'>10:8 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have</a>
<a id='line_3927'>brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two</a>
<a id='line_3928'>heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.</a>
<a id='line_3929'></a>
<a id='line_3930'>10:9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,</a>
<a id='line_3931'>and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired</a>
<a id='line_3932'>against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?  10:10 Know</a>
<a id='line_3933'>now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the</a>
<a id='line_3934'>LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3935'>hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.</a>
<a id='line_3936'></a>
<a id='line_3937'>10:11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,</a>
<a id='line_3938'>and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he</a>
<a id='line_3939'>left him none remaining.</a>
<a id='line_3940'></a>
<a id='line_3941'>10:12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at</a>
<a id='line_3942'>the shearing house in the way, 10:13 Jehu met with the brethren of</a>
<a id='line_3943'>Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are</a>
<a id='line_3944'>the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the</a>
<a id='line_3945'>king and the children of the queen.</a>
<a id='line_3946'></a>
<a id='line_3947'>10:14 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew</a>
<a id='line_3948'>them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither</a>
<a id='line_3949'>left he any of them.</a>
<a id='line_3950'></a>
<a id='line_3951'>10:15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son</a>
<a id='line_3952'>of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is</a>
<a id='line_3953'>thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab</a>
<a id='line_3954'>answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his</a>
<a id='line_3955'>hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</a>
<a id='line_3956'></a>
<a id='line_3957'>10:16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they</a>
<a id='line_3958'>made him ride in his chariot.</a>
<a id='line_3959'></a>
<a id='line_3960'>10:17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab</a>
<a id='line_3961'>in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the</a>
<a id='line_3962'>LORD, which he spake to Elijah.</a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>10:18 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_3965'>Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</a>
<a id='line_3966'></a>
<a id='line_3967'>10:19 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his</a>
<a id='line_3968'>servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great</a>
<a id='line_3969'>sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not</a>
<a id='line_3970'>live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy</a>
<a id='line_3971'>the worshippers of Baal.</a>
<a id='line_3972'></a>
<a id='line_3973'>10:20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they</a>
<a id='line_3974'>proclaimed it.</a>
<a id='line_3975'></a>
<a id='line_3976'>10:21 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of</a>
<a id='line_3977'>Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they</a>
<a id='line_3978'>came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one</a>
<a id='line_3979'>end to another.</a>
<a id='line_3980'></a>
<a id='line_3981'>10:22 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth</a>
<a id='line_3982'>vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth</a>
<a id='line_3983'>vestments.</a>
<a id='line_3984'></a>
<a id='line_3985'>10:23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house</a>
<a id='line_3986'>of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that</a>
<a id='line_3987'>there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the</a>
<a id='line_3988'>worshippers of Baal only.</a>
<a id='line_3989'></a>
<a id='line_3990'>10:24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,</a>
<a id='line_3991'>Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom</a>
<a id='line_3992'>I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his</a>
<a id='line_3993'>life shall be for the life of him.</a>
<a id='line_3994'></a>
<a id='line_3995'>10:25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering</a>
<a id='line_3996'>the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains,</a>
<a id='line_3997'>Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with</a>
<a id='line_3998'>the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out,</a>
<a id='line_3999'>and went to the city of the house of Baal.</a>
<a id='line_4000'></a>
<a id='line_4001'>10:26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and</a>
<a id='line_4002'>burned them.</a>
<a id='line_4003'></a>
<a id='line_4004'>10:27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house</a>
<a id='line_4005'>of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_4006'></a>
<a id='line_4007'>10:28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4008'></a>
<a id='line_4009'>10:29 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made</a>
<a id='line_4010'>Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden</a>
<a id='line_4011'>calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</a>
<a id='line_4012'></a>
<a id='line_4013'>10:30 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in</a>
<a id='line_4014'>executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the</a>
<a id='line_4015'>house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of</a>
<a id='line_4016'>the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4017'></a>
<a id='line_4018'>10:31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_4019'>Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of</a>
<a id='line_4020'>Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.</a>
<a id='line_4021'></a>
<a id='line_4022'>10:32 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael</a>
<a id='line_4023'>smote them in all the coasts of Israel; 10:33 From Jordan eastward,</a>
<a id='line_4024'>all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the</a>
<a id='line_4025'>Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and</a>
<a id='line_4026'>Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_4027'></a>
<a id='line_4028'>10:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all</a>
<a id='line_4029'>his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the</a>
<a id='line_4030'>kings of Israel?  10:35 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they</a>
<a id='line_4031'>buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4032'></a>
<a id='line_4033'>10:36 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty</a>
<a id='line_4034'>and eight years.</a>
<a id='line_4035'></a>
<a id='line_4036'>11:1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was</a>
<a id='line_4037'>dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.</a>
<a id='line_4038'></a>
<a id='line_4039'>11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,</a>
<a id='line_4040'>took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4041'>sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in</a>
<a id='line_4042'>the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.</a>
<a id='line_4043'></a>
<a id='line_4044'>11:3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And</a>
<a id='line_4045'>Athaliah did reign over the land.</a>
<a id='line_4046'></a>
<a id='line_4047'>11:4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over</a>
<a id='line_4048'>hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him</a>
<a id='line_4049'>into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an</a>
<a id='line_4050'>oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.</a>
<a id='line_4051'></a>
<a id='line_4052'>11:5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4053'>do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be</a>
<a id='line_4054'>keepers of the watch of the king’s house; 11:6 And a third part shall</a>
<a id='line_4055'>be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard:</a>
<a id='line_4056'>so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.</a>
<a id='line_4057'></a>
<a id='line_4058'>11:7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they</a>
<a id='line_4059'>shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.</a>
<a id='line_4060'></a>
<a id='line_4061'>11:8 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his</a>
<a id='line_4062'>weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be</a>
<a id='line_4063'>slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.</a>
<a id='line_4064'></a>
<a id='line_4065'>11:9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things</a>
<a id='line_4066'>that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men</a>
<a id='line_4067'>that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on</a>
<a id='line_4068'>the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.</a>
<a id='line_4069'></a>
<a id='line_4070'>11:10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king</a>
<a id='line_4071'>David’s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4072'></a>
<a id='line_4073'>11:11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_4074'>round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left</a>
<a id='line_4075'>corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.</a>
<a id='line_4076'></a>
<a id='line_4077'>11:12 And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him,</a>
<a id='line_4078'>and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him;</a>
<a id='line_4079'>and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.</a>
<a id='line_4080'></a>
<a id='line_4081'>11:13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the</a>
<a id='line_4082'>people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4083'></a>
<a id='line_4084'>11:14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the</a>
<a id='line_4085'>manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all</a>
<a id='line_4086'>the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah</a>
<a id='line_4087'>rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.</a>
<a id='line_4088'></a>
<a id='line_4089'>11:15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,</a>
<a id='line_4090'>the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without</a>
<a id='line_4091'>the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the</a>
<a id='line_4092'>priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4093'></a>
<a id='line_4094'>11:16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which</a>
<a id='line_4095'>the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.</a>
<a id='line_4096'></a>
<a id='line_4097'>11:17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and</a>
<a id='line_4098'>the people, that they should be the LORD’s people; between the king</a>
<a id='line_4099'>also and the people.</a>
<a id='line_4100'></a>
<a id='line_4101'>11:18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and</a>
<a id='line_4102'>brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces</a>
<a id='line_4103'>thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And</a>
<a id='line_4104'>the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4105'></a>
<a id='line_4106'>11:19 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the</a>
<a id='line_4107'>guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king</a>
<a id='line_4108'>from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the</a>
<a id='line_4109'>guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.</a>
<a id='line_4110'></a>
<a id='line_4111'>11:20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in</a>
<a id='line_4112'>quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king’s house.</a>
<a id='line_4113'></a>
<a id='line_4114'>11:21 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.</a>
<a id='line_4115'></a>
<a id='line_4116'>12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty</a>
<a id='line_4117'>years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zibiah of</a>
<a id='line_4118'>Beersheba.</a>
<a id='line_4119'></a>
<a id='line_4120'>12:2 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all</a>
<a id='line_4121'>his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</a>
<a id='line_4122'></a>
<a id='line_4123'>12:3 But the high places were not taken away: the people still</a>
<a id='line_4124'>sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</a>
<a id='line_4125'></a>
<a id='line_4126'>12:4 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated</a>
<a id='line_4127'>things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of</a>
<a id='line_4128'>every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set</a>
<a id='line_4129'>at, and all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring into</a>
<a id='line_4130'>the house of the LORD, 12:5 Let the priests take it to them, every man</a>
<a id='line_4131'>of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,</a>
<a id='line_4132'>wheresoever any breach shall be found.</a>
<a id='line_4133'></a>
<a id='line_4134'>12:6 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king</a>
<a id='line_4135'>Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.</a>
<a id='line_4136'></a>
<a id='line_4137'>12:7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other</a>
<a id='line_4138'>priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the</a>
<a id='line_4139'>house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but</a>
<a id='line_4140'>deliver it for the breaches of the house.</a>
<a id='line_4141'></a>
<a id='line_4142'>12:8 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,</a>
<a id='line_4143'>neither to repair the breaches of the house.</a>
<a id='line_4144'></a>
<a id='line_4145'>12:9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid</a>
<a id='line_4146'>of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh</a>
<a id='line_4147'>into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put</a>
<a id='line_4148'>therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4149'></a>
<a id='line_4150'>12:10 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the</a>
<a id='line_4151'>chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they</a>
<a id='line_4152'>put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the</a>
<a id='line_4153'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4154'></a>
<a id='line_4155'>12:11 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that</a>
<a id='line_4156'>did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and</a>
<a id='line_4157'>they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the</a>
<a id='line_4158'>house of the LORD, 12:12 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to</a>
<a id='line_4159'>buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_4160'>LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.</a>
<a id='line_4161'></a>
<a id='line_4162'>12:13 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of</a>
<a id='line_4163'>silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of</a>
<a id='line_4164'>silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_4165'>12:14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the</a>
<a id='line_4166'>house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4167'></a>
<a id='line_4168'>12:15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they</a>
<a id='line_4169'>delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt</a>
<a id='line_4170'>faithfully.</a>
<a id='line_4171'></a>
<a id='line_4172'>12:16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house</a>
<a id='line_4173'>of the LORD: it was the priests’.</a>
<a id='line_4174'></a>
<a id='line_4175'>12:17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and</a>
<a id='line_4176'>took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4177'></a>
<a id='line_4178'>12:18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that</a>
<a id='line_4179'>Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah,</a>

<a id='line_4181'>found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4182'>house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from</a>
<a id='line_4183'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_4184'></a>
<a id='line_4185'>12:19 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they</a>
<a id='line_4186'>not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</a>
<a id='line_4187'>12:20 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in</a>
<a id='line_4188'>the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.</a>
<a id='line_4189'></a>
<a id='line_4190'>12:21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of</a>
<a id='line_4191'>Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with</a>

<a id='line_4195'>13:1 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king</a>

<a id='line_4199'>13:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and</a>

<a id='line_4202'></a>
<a id='line_4203'>13:3 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he</a>

<a id='line_4207'>13:4 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:</a>

<a id='line_4209'>oppressed them.</a>
<a id='line_4210'></a>
<a id='line_4211'>13:5 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from</a>

<a id='line_4214'></a>
<a id='line_4215'>13:6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of</a>
<a id='line_4216'>Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained</a>

<a id='line_4218'>to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand</a>
<a id='line_4219'>footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them</a>

<a id='line_4230'></a>
<a id='line_4231'>13:11 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he</a>

<a id='line_4238'>And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:</a>
<a id='line_4239'>and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4240'></a>
<a id='line_4241'>13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And</a>
<a id='line_4242'>Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face,</a>
<a id='line_4243'>and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the</a>
<a id='line_4244'>horsemen thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4245'></a>
<a id='line_4246'>13:15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto</a>

<a id='line_4249'>13:16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.</a>
<a id='line_4250'>And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4251'>hands.</a>
<a id='line_4252'></a>
<a id='line_4253'>13:17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then</a>
<a id='line_4254'>Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD’s</a>
<a id='line_4255'>deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_4256'>smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.</a>
<a id='line_4257'></a>
<a id='line_4258'>13:18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto</a>
<a id='line_4259'>the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and</a>
<a id='line_4260'>stayed.</a>
<a id='line_4261'></a>
<a id='line_4262'>13:19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest</a>

<a id='line_4264'>thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.</a>
<a id='line_4265'></a>
<a id='line_4266'>13:20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the</a>
<a id='line_4267'>Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</a>
<a id='line_4268'></a>
<a id='line_4269'>13:21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,</a>
<a id='line_4270'>they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of</a>
<a id='line_4271'>Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of</a>
<a id='line_4272'>Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</a>
<a id='line_4273'></a>
<a id='line_4274'>13:22 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of</a>
<a id='line_4275'>Jehoahaz.</a>
<a id='line_4276'></a>
<a id='line_4277'>13:23 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,</a>

<a id='line_4281'></a>
<a id='line_4282'>13:24 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in</a>

<a id='line_4285'>13:25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of</a>

<a id='line_4289'></a>
<a id='line_4290'>14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel</a>

<a id='line_4293'>14:2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and</a>
<a id='line_4294'>reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was</a>

<a id='line_4296'></a>
<a id='line_4297'>14:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not</a>
<a id='line_4298'>like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his</a>
<a id='line_4299'>father did.</a>
<a id='line_4300'></a>
<a id='line_4301'>14:4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people</a>
<a id='line_4302'>did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.</a>
<a id='line_4303'></a>
<a id='line_4304'>14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his</a>
<a id='line_4305'>hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.</a>
<a id='line_4306'></a>
<a id='line_4307'>14:6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto</a>
<a id='line_4308'>that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the</a>
<a id='line_4309'>LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the</a>
<a id='line_4310'>children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every</a>
<a id='line_4311'>man shall be put to death for his own sin.</a>
<a id='line_4312'></a>
<a id='line_4313'>14:7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took</a>
<a id='line_4314'>Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'>14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son</a>

<a id='line_4318'>face.</a>
<a id='line_4319'></a>
<a id='line_4320'>14:9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,</a>
<a id='line_4321'>saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in</a>
<a id='line_4322'>Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed</a>
<a id='line_4323'>by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</a>
<a id='line_4324'></a>
<a id='line_4325'>14:10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee</a>
<a id='line_4326'>up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to</a>
<a id='line_4327'>thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</a>
<a id='line_4328'>14:11 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4329'>went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the</a>
<a id='line_4330'>face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</a>
<a id='line_4331'></a>
<a id='line_4332'>14:12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled</a>
<a id='line_4333'>every man to their tents.</a>
<a id='line_4334'></a>
<a id='line_4335'>14:13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son</a>
<a id='line_4336'>of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_4337'>and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the</a>
<a id='line_4338'>corner gate, four hundred cubits.</a>
<a id='line_4339'></a>
<a id='line_4340'>14:14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that</a>
<a id='line_4341'>were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the</a>
<a id='line_4342'>king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_4343'></a>
<a id='line_4344'>14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,</a>

<a id='line_4346'>the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  14:16 And Jehoash</a>
<a id='line_4347'>slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of</a>
<a id='line_4348'>Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4349'></a>
<a id='line_4350'>14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death</a>
<a id='line_4351'>of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</a>
<a id='line_4352'></a>
<a id='line_4353'>14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the</a>
<a id='line_4354'>book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  14:19 Now they made a</a>
<a id='line_4355'>conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they</a>
<a id='line_4356'>sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</a>
<a id='line_4357'></a>
<a id='line_4358'>14:20 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_4359'>with his fathers in the city of David.</a>
<a id='line_4360'></a>
<a id='line_4361'>14:21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen</a>
<a id='line_4362'>years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</a>
<a id='line_4363'></a>
<a id='line_4364'>14:22 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king</a>
<a id='line_4365'>slept with his fathers.</a>

<a id='line_4374'></a>
<a id='line_4375'>14:25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto</a>

<a id='line_4377'>which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai,</a>
<a id='line_4378'>the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.</a>
<a id='line_4379'></a>
<a id='line_4380'>14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very</a>

<a id='line_4383'></a>
<a id='line_4384'>14:27 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel</a>

<a id='line_4391'>of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  14:29 And Jeroboam slept</a>
<a id='line_4392'>with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son</a>

<a id='line_4407'>15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day</a>

<a id='line_4509'>15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4510'>began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.</a>
<a id='line_4511'></a>
<a id='line_4512'>15:33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he</a>
<a id='line_4513'>reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerusha,</a>
<a id='line_4514'>the daughter of Zadok.</a>
<a id='line_4515'></a>
<a id='line_4516'>15:34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did</a>
<a id='line_4517'>according to all that his father Uzziah had done.</a>
<a id='line_4518'></a>
<a id='line_4519'>15:35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed</a>
<a id='line_4520'>and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate</a>
<a id='line_4521'>of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4522'></a>
<a id='line_4523'>15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are</a>
<a id='line_4524'>they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</a>
<a id='line_4525'>15:37 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the</a>
<a id='line_4526'>king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.</a>
<a id='line_4527'></a>
<a id='line_4528'>15:38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his</a>
<a id='line_4529'>fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in</a>
<a id='line_4530'>his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4531'></a>
<a id='line_4532'>16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son</a>
<a id='line_4533'>of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.</a>
<a id='line_4534'></a>
<a id='line_4535'>16:2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned</a>
<a id='line_4536'>sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the</a>
<a id='line_4537'>sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.</a>
<a id='line_4538'></a>
<a id='line_4539'>16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made</a>
<a id='line_4540'>his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the</a>
<a id='line_4541'>heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4542'></a>
<a id='line_4543'>16:4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on</a>
<a id='line_4544'>the hills, and under every green tree.</a>
<a id='line_4545'></a>
<a id='line_4546'>16:5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel</a>
<a id='line_4547'>came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not</a>
<a id='line_4548'>overcome him.</a>
<a id='line_4549'></a>
<a id='line_4550'>16:6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and</a>
<a id='line_4551'>drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt</a>
<a id='line_4552'>there unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_4553'></a>
<a id='line_4554'>16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,</a>
<a id='line_4555'>saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the</a>
<a id='line_4556'>hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_4557'>which rise up against me.</a>
<a id='line_4558'></a>
<a id='line_4559'>16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of</a>
<a id='line_4560'>the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a</a>
<a id='line_4561'>present to the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_4562'></a>
<a id='line_4563'>16:9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of</a>
<a id='line_4564'>Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people</a>
<a id='line_4565'>of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</a>
<a id='line_4566'></a>
<a id='line_4567'>16:10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of</a>
<a id='line_4568'>Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to</a>
<a id='line_4569'>Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it,</a>
<a id='line_4570'>according to all the workmanship thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4571'></a>
<a id='line_4572'>16:11 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king</a>
<a id='line_4573'>Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king</a>
<a id='line_4574'>Ahaz came from Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_4575'></a>
<a id='line_4576'>16:12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the</a>
<a id='line_4577'>altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</a>
<a id='line_4578'></a>
<a id='line_4579'>16:13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and</a>
<a id='line_4580'>poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace</a>
<a id='line_4581'>offerings, upon the altar.</a>
<a id='line_4582'></a>
<a id='line_4583'>16:14 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4584'>from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house</a>
<a id='line_4585'>of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.</a>
<a id='line_4586'></a>
<a id='line_4587'>16:15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the</a>
<a id='line_4588'>great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat</a>
<a id='line_4589'>offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with</a>
<a id='line_4590'>the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat</a>
<a id='line_4591'>offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the</a>
<a id='line_4592'>blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and</a>
<a id='line_4593'>the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.</a>
<a id='line_4594'></a>
<a id='line_4595'>16:16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz</a>
<a id='line_4596'>commanded.</a>
<a id='line_4597'></a>
<a id='line_4598'>16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the</a>
<a id='line_4599'>laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen</a>
<a id='line_4600'>that were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.</a>
<a id='line_4601'></a>
<a id='line_4602'>16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house,</a>
<a id='line_4603'>and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for</a>
<a id='line_4604'>the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_4605'></a>
<a id='line_4606'>16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not</a>
<a id='line_4607'>written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  16:20</a>
<a id='line_4608'>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in</a>
<a id='line_4609'>the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_4610'></a>
<a id='line_4611'>17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of</a>
<a id='line_4612'>Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.</a>
<a id='line_4613'></a>
<a id='line_4614'>17:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not</a>
<a id='line_4615'>as the kings of Israel that were before him.</a>
<a id='line_4616'></a>
<a id='line_4617'>17:3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea</a>
<a id='line_4618'>became his servant, and gave him presents.</a>
<a id='line_4619'></a>
<a id='line_4620'>17:4 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had</a>
<a id='line_4621'>sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the</a>
<a id='line_4622'>king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of</a>
<a id='line_4623'>Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</a>
<a id='line_4624'></a>
<a id='line_4625'>17:5 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and</a>
<a id='line_4626'>went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</a>
<a id='line_4627'></a>
<a id='line_4628'>17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and</a>
<a id='line_4629'>carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in</a>
<a id='line_4630'>Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</a>
<a id='line_4631'></a>
<a id='line_4632'>17:7 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the</a>
<a id='line_4633'>LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_4634'>from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other</a>
<a id='line_4635'>gods, 17:8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4636'>cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of</a>
<a id='line_4637'>Israel, which they had made.</a>
<a id='line_4638'></a>
<a id='line_4639'>17:9 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were</a>
<a id='line_4640'>not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places</a>
<a id='line_4641'>in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced</a>
<a id='line_4642'>city.</a>
<a id='line_4643'></a>
<a id='line_4644'>17:10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and</a>
<a id='line_4645'>under every green tree: 17:11 And there they burnt incense in all the</a>
<a id='line_4646'>high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before</a>
<a id='line_4647'>them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger: 17:12</a>
<a id='line_4648'>For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4649'>not do this thing.</a>
<a id='line_4650'></a>
<a id='line_4651'>17:13 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all</a>
<a id='line_4652'>the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil</a>
<a id='line_4653'>ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the</a>
<a id='line_4654'>law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my</a>
<a id='line_4655'>servants the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_4656'></a>
<a id='line_4657'>17:14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,</a>
<a id='line_4658'>like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4659'>their God.</a>
<a id='line_4660'></a>
<a id='line_4661'>17:15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made</a>
<a id='line_4662'>with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against</a>
<a id='line_4663'>them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the</a>
<a id='line_4664'>heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_4665'>charged them, that they should not do like them.</a>
<a id='line_4666'></a>
<a id='line_4667'>17:16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and</a>
<a id='line_4668'>made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and</a>
<a id='line_4669'>worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.</a>
<a id='line_4670'></a>
<a id='line_4671'>17:17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through</a>
<a id='line_4672'>the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to</a>
<a id='line_4673'>do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</a>
<a id='line_4674'></a>
<a id='line_4675'>17:18 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them</a>
<a id='line_4676'>out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</a>
<a id='line_4677'></a>
<a id='line_4678'>17:19 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but</a>
<a id='line_4679'>walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.</a>
<a id='line_4680'></a>
<a id='line_4681'>17:20 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted</a>
<a id='line_4682'>them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast</a>
<a id='line_4683'>them out of his sight.</a>
<a id='line_4684'></a>
<a id='line_4685'>17:21 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made</a>
<a id='line_4686'>Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from</a>
<a id='line_4687'>following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.</a>
<a id='line_4688'></a>
<a id='line_4689'>17:22 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam</a>
<a id='line_4690'>which he did; they departed not from them; 17:23 Until the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4691'>removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants</a>
<a id='line_4692'>the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to</a>
<a id='line_4693'>Assyria unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_4694'></a>
<a id='line_4695'>17:24 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from</a>
<a id='line_4696'>Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed</a>
<a id='line_4697'>them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and</a>
<a id='line_4698'>they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4699'></a>
<a id='line_4700'>17:25 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that</a>
<a id='line_4701'>they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them,</a>
<a id='line_4702'>which slew some of them.</a>
<a id='line_4703'></a>
<a id='line_4704'>17:26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations</a>
<a id='line_4705'>which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not</a>
<a id='line_4706'>the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among</a>
<a id='line_4707'>them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of</a>
<a id='line_4708'>the God of the land.</a>
<a id='line_4709'></a>
<a id='line_4710'>17:27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of</a>
<a id='line_4711'>the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell</a>
<a id='line_4712'>there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.</a>
<a id='line_4713'></a>
<a id='line_4714'>17:28 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria</a>
<a id='line_4715'>came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the</a>
<a id='line_4716'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4717'></a>
<a id='line_4718'>17:29 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the</a>
<a id='line_4719'>houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation</a>
<a id='line_4720'>in their cities wherein they dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_4721'></a>
<a id='line_4722'>17:30 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth</a>
<a id='line_4723'>made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 17:31 And the Avites</a>
<a id='line_4724'>made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in</a>
<a id='line_4725'>fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</a>
<a id='line_4726'></a>
<a id='line_4727'>17:32 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest</a>
<a id='line_4728'>of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the</a>
<a id='line_4729'>houses of the high places.</a>
<a id='line_4730'></a>
<a id='line_4731'>17:33 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the</a>
<a id='line_4732'>manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.</a>
<a id='line_4733'></a>
<a id='line_4734'>17:34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not</a>
<a id='line_4735'>the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their</a>
<a id='line_4736'>ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded</a>
<a id='line_4737'>the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 17:35 With whom the LORD</a>
<a id='line_4738'>had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other</a>
<a id='line_4739'>gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to</a>
<a id='line_4740'>them: 17:36 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_4741'>with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him</a>
<a id='line_4742'>shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_4743'></a>
<a id='line_4744'>17:37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the</a>
<a id='line_4745'>commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for</a>
<a id='line_4746'>evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.</a>
<a id='line_4747'></a>
<a id='line_4748'>17:38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;</a>
<a id='line_4749'>neither shall ye fear other gods.</a>
<a id='line_4750'></a>
<a id='line_4751'>17:39 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you</a>
<a id='line_4752'>out of the hand of all your enemies.</a>
<a id='line_4753'></a>
<a id='line_4754'>17:40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former</a>
<a id='line_4755'>manner.</a>
<a id='line_4756'></a>
<a id='line_4757'>17:41 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven</a>
<a id='line_4758'>images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did</a>
<a id='line_4759'>their fathers, so do they unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_4760'></a>
<a id='line_4761'>18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king</a>
<a id='line_4762'>of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</a>
<a id='line_4763'></a>
<a id='line_4764'>18:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he</a>
<a id='line_4765'>reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was</a>
<a id='line_4766'>Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.</a>
<a id='line_4767'></a>
<a id='line_4768'>18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4769'>according to all that David his father did.</a>
<a id='line_4770'></a>
<a id='line_4771'>18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down</a>
<a id='line_4772'>the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had</a>
<a id='line_4773'>made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to</a>
<a id='line_4774'>it: and he called it Nehushtan.</a>
<a id='line_4775'></a>
<a id='line_4776'>18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none</a>
<a id='line_4777'>like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</a>
<a id='line_4778'></a>
<a id='line_4779'>18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,</a>
<a id='line_4780'>but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_4781'></a>
<a id='line_4782'>18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went</a>
<a id='line_4783'>forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him</a>
<a id='line_4784'>not.</a>
<a id='line_4785'></a>
<a id='line_4786'>18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders</a>
<a id='line_4787'>thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</a>
<a id='line_4788'></a>
<a id='line_4789'>18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which</a>
<a id='line_4790'>was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that</a>
<a id='line_4791'>Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.</a>
<a id='line_4792'></a>
<a id='line_4793'>18:10 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth</a>
<a id='line_4794'>year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_4795'>Samaria was taken.</a>
<a id='line_4796'></a>
<a id='line_4797'>18:11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and</a>
<a id='line_4798'>put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the</a>
<a id='line_4799'>cities of the Medes: 18:12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_4800'>LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the</a>
<a id='line_4801'>servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.</a>
<a id='line_4802'></a>
<a id='line_4803'>18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king</a>
<a id='line_4804'>of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took</a>
<a id='line_4805'>them.</a>
<a id='line_4806'></a>
<a id='line_4807'>18:14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to</a>
<a id='line_4808'>Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou</a>
<a id='line_4809'>puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto</a>
<a id='line_4810'>Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty</a>
<a id='line_4811'>talents of gold.</a>
<a id='line_4812'></a>
<a id='line_4813'>18:15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house</a>
<a id='line_4814'>of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.</a>
<a id='line_4815'></a>
<a id='line_4816'>18:16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the</a>
<a id='line_4817'>temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah</a>
<a id='line_4818'>had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_4819'></a>
<a id='line_4820'>18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh</a>
<a id='line_4821'>from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And</a>
<a id='line_4822'>they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they</a>
<a id='line_4823'>came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the</a>
<a id='line_4824'>highway of the fuller’s field.</a>
<a id='line_4825'></a>
<a id='line_4826'>18:18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them</a>
<a id='line_4827'>Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna</a>
<a id='line_4828'>the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</a>
<a id='line_4829'></a>
<a id='line_4830'>18:19 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus</a>
<a id='line_4831'>saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this</a>
<a id='line_4832'>wherein thou trustest?  18:20 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain</a>
<a id='line_4833'>words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou</a>
<a id='line_4834'>trust, that thou rebellest against me?  18:21 Now, behold, thou</a>
<a id='line_4835'>trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on</a>
<a id='line_4836'>which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is</a>
<a id='line_4837'>Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</a>
<a id='line_4838'></a>
<a id='line_4839'>18:22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that</a>
<a id='line_4840'>he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and</a>
<a id='line_4841'>hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar</a>
<a id='line_4842'>in Jerusalem?  18:23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my</a>
<a id='line_4843'>lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses,</a>
<a id='line_4844'>if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</a>
<a id='line_4845'></a>
<a id='line_4846'>18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the</a>
<a id='line_4847'>least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots</a>
<a id='line_4848'>and for horsemen?  18:25 Am I now come up without the LORD against</a>
<a id='line_4849'>this place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this</a>
<a id='line_4850'>land, and destroy it.</a>
<a id='line_4851'></a>
<a id='line_4852'>18:26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto</a>
<a id='line_4853'>Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language;</a>
<a id='line_4854'>for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews’ language in</a>
<a id='line_4855'>the ears of the people that are on the wall.</a>
<a id='line_4856'></a>
<a id='line_4857'>18:27 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy</a>
<a id='line_4858'>master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the</a>
<a id='line_4859'>men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink</a>
<a id='line_4860'>their own piss with you?  18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a</a>
<a id='line_4861'>loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of</a>
<a id='line_4862'>the great king, the king of Assyria: 18:29 Thus saith the king, Let</a>
<a id='line_4863'>not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out</a>
<a id='line_4864'>of his hand: 18:30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_4865'>saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be</a>
<a id='line_4866'>delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_4867'></a>
<a id='line_4868'>18:31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,</a>
<a id='line_4869'>Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then</a>
<a id='line_4870'>eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and</a>
<a id='line_4871'>drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: 18:32 Until I come and</a>
<a id='line_4872'>take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a</a>
<a id='line_4873'>land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye</a>
<a id='line_4874'>may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he</a>
<a id='line_4875'>persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.</a>
<a id='line_4876'></a>
<a id='line_4877'>18:33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land</a>
<a id='line_4878'>out of the hand of the king of Assyria?  18:34 Where are the gods of</a>
<a id='line_4879'>Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and</a>
<a id='line_4880'>Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?  18:35 Who are</a>
<a id='line_4881'>they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their</a>
<a id='line_4882'>country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out</a>
<a id='line_4883'>of mine hand?  18:36 But the people held their peace, and answered him</a>
<a id='line_4884'>not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</a>
<a id='line_4885'></a>
<a id='line_4886'>18:37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the</a>
<a id='line_4887'>household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the</a>
<a id='line_4888'>recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words</a>
<a id='line_4889'>of Rabshakeh.</a>
<a id='line_4890'></a>
<a id='line_4891'>19:1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent</a>
<a id='line_4892'>his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the</a>
<a id='line_4893'>house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4894'></a>
<a id='line_4895'>19:2 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the</a>
<a id='line_4896'>scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to</a>
<a id='line_4897'>Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</a>
<a id='line_4898'></a>
<a id='line_4899'>19:3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of</a>
<a id='line_4900'>trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to</a>
<a id='line_4901'>the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</a>
<a id='line_4902'></a>
<a id='line_4903'>19:4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,</a>
<a id='line_4904'>whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living</a>
<a id='line_4905'>God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard:</a>
<a id='line_4906'>wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.</a>
<a id='line_4907'></a>
<a id='line_4908'>19:5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</a>
<a id='line_4909'></a>
<a id='line_4910'>19:6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus</a>
<a id='line_4911'>saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with</a>
<a id='line_4912'>which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</a>
<a id='line_4913'></a>
<a id='line_4914'>19:7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,</a>
<a id='line_4915'>and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the</a>
<a id='line_4916'>sword in his own land.</a>
<a id='line_4917'></a>
<a id='line_4918'>19:8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring</a>
<a id='line_4919'>against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</a>
<a id='line_4920'></a>
<a id='line_4921'>19:9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is</a>
<a id='line_4922'>come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto</a>
<a id='line_4923'>Hezekiah, saying, 19:10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah,</a>
<a id='line_4924'>saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying,</a>
<a id='line_4925'>Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</a>
<a id='line_4926'></a>
<a id='line_4927'>19:11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to</a>
<a id='line_4928'>all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?</a>
<a id='line_4929'>19:12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers</a>
<a id='line_4930'>have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of</a>
<a id='line_4931'>Eden which were in Thelasar?  19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, and</a>
<a id='line_4932'>the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena,</a>
<a id='line_4933'>and Ivah?  19:14 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_4934'>messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the</a>
<a id='line_4935'>LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_4936'></a>
<a id='line_4937'>19:15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_4938'>Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even</a>
<a id='line_4939'>thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven</a>
<a id='line_4940'>and earth.</a>
<a id='line_4941'></a>
<a id='line_4942'>19:16 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and</a>
<a id='line_4943'>see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to</a>
<a id='line_4944'>reproach the living God.</a>
<a id='line_4945'></a>
<a id='line_4946'>19:17 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the</a>
<a id='line_4947'>nations and their lands, 19:18 And have cast their gods into the fire:</a>
<a id='line_4948'>for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone:</a>
<a id='line_4949'>therefore they have destroyed them.</a>
<a id='line_4950'></a>
<a id='line_4951'>19:19 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out</a>
<a id='line_4952'>of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art</a>
<a id='line_4953'>the LORD God, even thou only.</a>
<a id='line_4954'></a>
<a id='line_4955'>19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith</a>
<a id='line_4956'>the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against</a>
<a id='line_4957'>Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</a>
<a id='line_4958'></a>
<a id='line_4959'>19:21 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The</a>
<a id='line_4960'>virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to</a>
<a id='line_4961'>scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</a>
<a id='line_4962'></a>
<a id='line_4963'>19:22 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast</a>
<a id='line_4964'>thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against</a>
<a id='line_4965'>the Holy One of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_4966'></a>
<a id='line_4967'>19:23 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,</a>
<a id='line_4968'>With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the</a>
<a id='line_4969'>mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar</a>
<a id='line_4970'>trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into</a>
<a id='line_4971'>the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</a>
<a id='line_4972'></a>
<a id='line_4973'>19:24 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my</a>
<a id='line_4974'>feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</a>
<a id='line_4975'></a>
<a id='line_4976'>19:25 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient</a>
<a id='line_4977'>times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou</a>
<a id='line_4978'>shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</a>
<a id='line_4979'></a>
<a id='line_4980'>19:26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were</a>
<a id='line_4981'>dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as</a>
<a id='line_4982'>the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted</a>
<a id='line_4983'>before it be grown up.</a>
<a id='line_4984'></a>
<a id='line_4985'>19:27 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and</a>
<a id='line_4986'>thy rage against me.</a>
<a id='line_4987'></a>
<a id='line_4988'>19:28 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine</a>
<a id='line_4989'>ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy</a>
<a id='line_4990'>lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</a>
<a id='line_4991'></a>
<a id='line_4992'>19:29 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such</a>
<a id='line_4993'>things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which</a>
<a id='line_4994'>springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and</a>
<a id='line_4995'>plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4996'></a>
<a id='line_4997'>19:30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet</a>
<a id='line_4998'>again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</a>
<a id='line_4999'></a>
<a id='line_5000'>19:31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that</a>
<a id='line_5001'>escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</a>
<a id='line_5002'></a>
<a id='line_5003'>19:32 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He</a>
<a id='line_5004'>shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come</a>
<a id='line_5005'>before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</a>
<a id='line_5006'></a>
<a id='line_5007'>19:33 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall</a>
<a id='line_5008'>not come into this city, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5009'></a>
<a id='line_5010'>19:34 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and</a>
<a id='line_5011'>for my servant David’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_5012'></a>
<a id='line_5013'>19:35 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went</a>
<a id='line_5014'>out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and</a>
<a id='line_5015'>five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they</a>
<a id='line_5016'>were all dead corpses.</a>
<a id='line_5017'></a>
<a id='line_5018'>19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,</a>
<a id='line_5019'>and dwelt at Nineveh.</a>
<a id='line_5020'></a>
<a id='line_5021'>19:37 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of</a>
<a id='line_5022'>Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with</a>
<a id='line_5023'>the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon</a>
<a id='line_5024'>his son reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_5025'></a>
<a id='line_5026'>20:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet</a>
<a id='line_5027'>Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the</a>
<a id='line_5028'>LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</a>
<a id='line_5029'></a>
<a id='line_5030'>20:2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_5031'>saying, 20:3 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked</a>
<a id='line_5032'>before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that</a>
<a id='line_5033'>which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</a>
<a id='line_5034'></a>
<a id='line_5035'>20:4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle</a>
<a id='line_5036'>court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, 20:5 Turn again,</a>
<a id='line_5037'>and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the</a>
<a id='line_5038'>God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy</a>
<a id='line_5039'>tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up</a>
<a id='line_5040'>unto the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5041'></a>
<a id='line_5042'>20:6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver</a>
<a id='line_5043'>thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will</a>
<a id='line_5044'>defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_5045'></a>
<a id='line_5046'>20:7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it</a>
<a id='line_5047'>on the boil, and he recovered.</a>
<a id='line_5048'></a>
<a id='line_5049'>20:8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the</a>
<a id='line_5050'>LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5051'>the third day?  20:9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the</a>
<a id='line_5052'>LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the</a>
<a id='line_5053'>shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?  20:10 And</a>
<a id='line_5054'>Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten</a>
<a id='line_5055'>degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</a>
<a id='line_5056'></a>
<a id='line_5057'>20:11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the</a>
<a id='line_5058'>shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of</a>
<a id='line_5059'>Ahaz.</a>
<a id='line_5060'></a>
<a id='line_5061'>20:12 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of</a>
<a id='line_5062'>Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard</a>
<a id='line_5063'>that Hezekiah had been sick.</a>
<a id='line_5064'></a>
<a id='line_5065'>20:13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house</a>
<a id='line_5066'>of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and</a>
<a id='line_5067'>the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that</a>
<a id='line_5068'>was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all</a>
<a id='line_5069'>his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</a>
<a id='line_5070'></a>
<a id='line_5071'>20:14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_5072'>him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And</a>
<a id='line_5073'>Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5074'></a>
<a id='line_5075'>20:15 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah</a>
<a id='line_5076'>answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there</a>
<a id='line_5077'>is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.</a>
<a id='line_5078'></a>
<a id='line_5079'>20:16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5080'></a>
<a id='line_5081'>20:17 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that</a>
<a id='line_5082'>which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be</a>
<a id='line_5083'>carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5084'></a>
<a id='line_5085'>20:18 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_5086'>beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace</a>
<a id='line_5087'>of the king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5088'></a>
<a id='line_5089'>20:19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5090'>which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and</a>
<a id='line_5091'>truth be in my days?  20:20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and</a>
<a id='line_5092'>all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought</a>
<a id='line_5093'>water into the city, are they not written in the book of the</a>
<a id='line_5094'>chronicles of the kings of Judah?  20:21 And Hezekiah slept with his</a>
<a id='line_5095'>fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</a>

<a id='line_5097'>21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned</a>
<a id='line_5098'>fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was</a>
<a id='line_5099'>Hephzibah.</a>
<a id='line_5100'></a>
<a id='line_5101'>21:2 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after</a>
<a id='line_5102'>the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the</a>
<a id='line_5103'>children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5104'></a>
<a id='line_5105'>21:3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father</a>
<a id='line_5106'>had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as</a>
<a id='line_5107'>did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_5108'>served them.</a>
<a id='line_5109'></a>
<a id='line_5110'>21:4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5111'>said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</a>
<a id='line_5112'></a>
<a id='line_5113'>21:5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts</a>
<a id='line_5114'>of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5115'></a>
<a id='line_5116'>21:6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,</a>
<a id='line_5117'>and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he</a>
<a id='line_5118'>wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to</a>
<a id='line_5119'>anger.</a>
<a id='line_5120'></a>
<a id='line_5121'>21:7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the</a>
<a id='line_5122'>house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In</a>
<a id='line_5123'>this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of</a>
<a id='line_5124'>Israel, will I put my name for ever: 21:8 Neither will I make the feet</a>
<a id='line_5125'>of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers;</a>
<a id='line_5126'>only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded</a>
<a id='line_5127'>them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded</a>
<a id='line_5128'>them.</a>
<a id='line_5129'></a>
<a id='line_5130'>21:9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil</a>
<a id='line_5131'>than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of</a>
<a id='line_5132'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_5133'></a>
<a id='line_5134'>21:10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 21:11</a>
<a id='line_5135'>Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath</a>
<a id='line_5136'>done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him,</a>
<a id='line_5137'>and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 21:12 Therefore thus</a>
<a id='line_5138'>saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon</a>
<a id='line_5139'>Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall</a>
<a id='line_5140'>tingle.</a>
<a id='line_5141'></a>
<a id='line_5142'>21:13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the</a>
<a id='line_5143'>plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man</a>
<a id='line_5144'>wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.</a>
<a id='line_5145'></a>
<a id='line_5146'>21:14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver</a>
<a id='line_5147'>them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and</a>
<a id='line_5148'>a spoil to all their enemies; 21:15 Because they have done that which</a>
<a id='line_5149'>was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day</a>
<a id='line_5150'>their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_5151'></a>
<a id='line_5152'>21:16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had</a>
<a id='line_5153'>filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he</a>
<a id='line_5154'>made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_5155'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5156'></a>
<a id='line_5157'>21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and</a>
<a id='line_5158'>his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the</a>
<a id='line_5159'>chronicles of the kings of Judah?  21:18 And Manasseh slept with his</a>
<a id='line_5160'>fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden</a>
<a id='line_5161'>of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</a>

<a id='line_5163'>21:19 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he</a>

<a id='line_5166'></a>
<a id='line_5167'>21:20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his</a>

<a id='line_5169'></a>
<a id='line_5170'>21:21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and</a>
<a id='line_5171'>served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 21:22</a>
<a id='line_5172'>And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way</a>
<a id='line_5173'>of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5174'></a>
<a id='line_5175'>21:23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the</a>

<a id='line_5177'></a>
<a id='line_5178'>21:24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired</a>
<a id='line_5179'>against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king</a>

<a id='line_5182'>21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not</a>

<a id='line_5187'>22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned</a>
<a id='line_5188'>thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jedidah,</a>

<a id='line_5190'></a>
<a id='line_5191'>22:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and</a>

<a id='line_5194'></a>
<a id='line_5195'>22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that</a>
<a id='line_5196'>the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the</a>

<a id='line_5198'>high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the</a>
<a id='line_5199'>house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the</a>
<a id='line_5200'>people: 22:5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the</a>
<a id='line_5201'>work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them</a>
<a id='line_5202'>give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to</a>
<a id='line_5203'>repair the breaches of the house, 22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders,</a>
<a id='line_5204'>and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</a>
<a id='line_5205'></a>
<a id='line_5206'>22:7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that</a>
<a id='line_5207'>was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</a>
<a id='line_5208'></a>
<a id='line_5209'>22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have</a>
<a id='line_5210'>found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave</a>
<a id='line_5211'>the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</a>
<a id='line_5212'></a>
<a id='line_5213'>22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king</a>
<a id='line_5214'>word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was</a>
<a id='line_5215'>found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that</a>
<a id='line_5216'>do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5217'></a>
<a id='line_5218'>22:10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the</a>
<a id='line_5219'>priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</a>
<a id='line_5220'></a>
<a id='line_5221'>22:11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the</a>
<a id='line_5222'>book of the law, that he rent his clothes.</a>
<a id='line_5223'></a>
<a id='line_5224'>22:12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of</a>
<a id='line_5225'>Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and</a>
<a id='line_5226'>Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying, 22:13 Go ye, enquire of the</a>
<a id='line_5227'>LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the</a>
<a id='line_5228'>words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_5229'>that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened</a>
<a id='line_5230'>unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is</a>
<a id='line_5231'>written concerning us.</a>
<a id='line_5232'></a>
<a id='line_5233'>22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and</a>
<a id='line_5234'>Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son</a>
<a id='line_5235'>of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt</a>
<a id='line_5236'>in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.</a>
<a id='line_5237'></a>
<a id='line_5238'>22:15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell</a>
<a id='line_5239'>the man that sent you to me, 22:16 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_5240'>bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all</a>
<a id='line_5241'>the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: 22:17 Because</a>
<a id='line_5242'>they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that</a>
<a id='line_5243'>they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands;</a>
<a id='line_5244'>therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not</a>
<a id='line_5245'>be quenched.</a>
<a id='line_5246'></a>
<a id='line_5247'>22:18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_5248'>thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As</a>
<a id='line_5249'>touching the words which thou hast heard; 22:19 Because thine heart</a>
<a id='line_5250'>was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou</a>
<a id='line_5251'>heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_5252'>thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast</a>
<a id='line_5253'>rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith</a>
<a id='line_5254'>the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5255'></a>
<a id='line_5256'>22:20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou</a>
<a id='line_5257'>shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not</a>
<a id='line_5258'>see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought</a>
<a id='line_5259'>the king word again.</a>
<a id='line_5260'></a>
<a id='line_5261'>23:1 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of</a>
<a id='line_5262'>Judah and of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5263'></a>
<a id='line_5264'>23:2 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men</a>
<a id='line_5265'>of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the</a>
<a id='line_5266'>priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great:</a>
<a id='line_5267'>and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant</a>
<a id='line_5268'>which was found in the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5269'></a>
<a id='line_5270'>23:3 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the</a>
<a id='line_5271'>LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his</a>
<a id='line_5272'>testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul,</a>
<a id='line_5273'>to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.</a>
<a id='line_5274'>And all the people stood to the covenant.</a>
<a id='line_5275'></a>
<a id='line_5276'>23:4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests</a>
<a id='line_5277'>of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out</a>
<a id='line_5278'>of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and</a>
<a id='line_5279'>for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them</a>
<a id='line_5280'>without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of</a>
<a id='line_5281'>them unto Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_5282'></a>
<a id='line_5283'>23:5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah</a>
<a id='line_5284'>had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of</a>
<a id='line_5285'>Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned</a>
<a id='line_5286'>incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets,</a>
<a id='line_5287'>and to all the host of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5288'></a>
<a id='line_5289'>23:6 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without</a>
<a id='line_5290'>Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron,</a>
<a id='line_5291'>and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the</a>
<a id='line_5292'>graves of the children of the people.</a>
<a id='line_5293'></a>
<a id='line_5294'>23:7 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the</a>
<a id='line_5295'>house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.</a>
<a id='line_5296'></a>
<a id='line_5297'>23:8 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_5298'>defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from</a>
<a id='line_5299'>Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that</a>
<a id='line_5300'>were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the</a>
<a id='line_5301'>city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.</a>
<a id='line_5302'></a>
<a id='line_5303'>23:9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the</a>
<a id='line_5304'>altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened</a>
<a id='line_5305'>bread among their brethren.</a>
<a id='line_5306'></a>
<a id='line_5307'>23:10 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children</a>
<a id='line_5308'>of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass</a>
<a id='line_5309'>through the fire to Molech.</a>
<a id='line_5310'></a>
<a id='line_5311'>23:11 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to</a>
<a id='line_5312'>the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber</a>
<a id='line_5313'>of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned</a>
<a id='line_5314'>the chariots of the sun with fire.</a>
<a id='line_5315'></a>
<a id='line_5316'>23:12 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of</a>
<a id='line_5317'>Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh</a>
<a id='line_5318'>had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat</a>
<a id='line_5319'>down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into</a>
<a id='line_5320'>the brook Kidron.</a>
<a id='line_5321'></a>
<a id='line_5322'>23:13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on</a>
<a id='line_5323'>the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of</a>
<a id='line_5324'>Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and</a>
<a id='line_5325'>for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the</a>
<a id='line_5326'>abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</a>
<a id='line_5327'></a>
<a id='line_5328'>23:14 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and</a>
<a id='line_5329'>filled their places with the bones of men.</a>
<a id='line_5330'></a>
<a id='line_5331'>23:15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which</a>
<a id='line_5332'>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that</a>
<a id='line_5333'>altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and</a>
<a id='line_5334'>stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.</a>
<a id='line_5335'></a>
<a id='line_5336'>23:16 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were</a>
<a id='line_5337'>there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the</a>
<a id='line_5338'>sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according</a>
<a id='line_5339'>to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who</a>
<a id='line_5340'>proclaimed these words.</a>
<a id='line_5341'></a>
<a id='line_5342'>23:17 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the</a>
<a id='line_5343'>city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from</a>
<a id='line_5344'>Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the</a>
<a id='line_5345'>altar of Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_5346'></a>
<a id='line_5347'>23:18 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they</a>
<a id='line_5348'>let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of</a>
<a id='line_5349'>Samaria.</a>
<a id='line_5350'></a>
<a id='line_5351'>23:19 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the</a>
<a id='line_5352'>cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the</a>
<a id='line_5353'>Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the</a>
<a id='line_5354'>acts that he had done in Bethel.</a>
<a id='line_5355'></a>
<a id='line_5356'>23:20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there</a>
<a id='line_5357'>upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned to</a>
<a id='line_5358'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5359'></a>
<a id='line_5360'>23:21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover</a>
<a id='line_5361'>unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</a>
<a id='line_5362'></a>
<a id='line_5363'>23:22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the</a>
<a id='line_5364'>judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_5365'>nor of the kings of Judah; 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of king</a>
<a id='line_5366'>Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5367'></a>
<a id='line_5368'>23:24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and</a>
<a id='line_5369'>the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in</a>
<a id='line_5370'>the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might</a>
<a id='line_5371'>perform the words of the law which were written in the book that</a>
<a id='line_5372'>Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_5373'></a>
<a id='line_5374'>23:25 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to</a>
<a id='line_5375'>the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his</a>
<a id='line_5376'>might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose</a>
<a id='line_5377'>there any like him.</a>
<a id='line_5378'></a>
<a id='line_5379'>23:26 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his</a>
<a id='line_5380'>great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of</a>
<a id='line_5381'>all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</a>
<a id='line_5382'></a>
<a id='line_5383'>23:27 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as</a>
<a id='line_5384'>I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I</a>
<a id='line_5385'>have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</a>
<a id='line_5386'></a>
<a id='line_5387'>23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are</a>

<a id='line_5392'></a>
<a id='line_5393'>23:30 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and</a>
<a id='line_5394'>brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the</a>
<a id='line_5395'>people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him,</a>
<a id='line_5396'>and made him king in his father’s stead.</a>
<a id='line_5397'></a>
<a id='line_5398'>23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign;</a>
<a id='line_5399'>and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was</a>
<a id='line_5400'>Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</a>
<a id='line_5401'></a>
<a id='line_5402'>23:32 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_5403'>according to all that his fathers had done.</a>
<a id='line_5404'></a>
<a id='line_5405'>23:33 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of</a>
<a id='line_5406'>Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a</a>
<a id='line_5407'>tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</a>
<a id='line_5408'></a>
<a id='line_5409'>23:34 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the</a>
<a id='line_5410'>room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took</a>
<a id='line_5411'>Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.</a>
<a id='line_5412'></a>
<a id='line_5413'>23:35 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he</a>
<a id='line_5414'>taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_5415'>Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land,</a>
<a id='line_5416'>of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.</a>
<a id='line_5417'></a>
<a id='line_5418'>23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign;</a>
<a id='line_5419'>and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was</a>
<a id='line_5420'>Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</a>
<a id='line_5421'></a>
<a id='line_5422'>23:37 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_5423'>according to all that his fathers had done.</a>
<a id='line_5424'></a>
<a id='line_5425'>24:1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim</a>
<a id='line_5426'>became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against</a>
<a id='line_5427'>him.</a>
<a id='line_5428'></a>
<a id='line_5429'>24:2 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of</a>
<a id='line_5430'>the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of</a>
<a id='line_5431'>Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the</a>
<a id='line_5432'>word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_5433'></a>
<a id='line_5434'>24:3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to</a>
<a id='line_5435'>remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to</a>
<a id='line_5436'>all that he did; 24:4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed:</a>
<a id='line_5437'>for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not</a>
<a id='line_5438'>pardon.</a>
<a id='line_5439'></a>
<a id='line_5440'>24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are</a>
<a id='line_5441'>they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</a>
<a id='line_5442'>24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son</a>
<a id='line_5443'>reigned in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_5444'></a>
<a id='line_5445'>24:7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:</a>
<a id='line_5446'>for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the</a>
<a id='line_5447'>river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_5448'></a>
<a id='line_5449'>24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he</a>
<a id='line_5450'>reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother’s name was Nehushta,</a>
<a id='line_5451'>the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_5452'></a>
<a id='line_5453'>24:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,</a>

<a id='line_5455'></a>
<a id='line_5456'>24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came</a>
<a id='line_5457'>up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.</a>
<a id='line_5458'></a>
<a id='line_5459'>24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and</a>
<a id='line_5460'>his servants did besiege it.</a>
<a id='line_5461'></a>
<a id='line_5462'>24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of</a>
<a id='line_5463'>Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and</a>
<a id='line_5464'>his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of</a>
<a id='line_5465'>his reign.</a>
<a id='line_5466'></a>
<a id='line_5467'>24:13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the</a>
<a id='line_5468'>LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the</a>
<a id='line_5469'>vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of</a>
<a id='line_5470'>the LORD, as the LORD had said.</a>
<a id='line_5471'></a>
<a id='line_5472'>24:14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all</a>
<a id='line_5473'>the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the</a>
<a id='line_5474'>craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the</a>
<a id='line_5475'>people of the land.</a>
<a id='line_5476'></a>
<a id='line_5477'>24:15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s</a>
<a id='line_5478'>mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the</a>
<a id='line_5479'>land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5480'></a>
<a id='line_5481'>24:16 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and</a>
<a id='line_5482'>smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the</a>
<a id='line_5483'>king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5484'></a>
<a id='line_5485'>24:17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king</a>
<a id='line_5486'>in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</a>
<a id='line_5487'></a>
<a id='line_5488'>24:18 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,</a>
<a id='line_5489'>and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was</a>
<a id='line_5490'>Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</a>
<a id='line_5491'></a>
<a id='line_5492'>24:19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_5493'>according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</a>
<a id='line_5494'></a>
<a id='line_5495'>24:20 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_5496'>and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah</a>
<a id='line_5497'>rebelled against the king of Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5498'></a>
<a id='line_5499'>25:1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth</a>
<a id='line_5500'>month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of</a>
<a id='line_5501'>Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched</a>
<a id='line_5502'>against it; and they built forts against it round about.</a>
<a id='line_5503'></a>
<a id='line_5504'>25:2 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king</a>
<a id='line_5505'>Zedekiah.</a>
<a id='line_5506'></a>
<a id='line_5507'>25:3 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in</a>
<a id='line_5508'>the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</a>
<a id='line_5509'></a>
<a id='line_5510'>25:4 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night</a>
<a id='line_5511'>by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s</a>
<a id='line_5512'>garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the</a>
<a id='line_5513'>king went the way toward the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5514'></a>
<a id='line_5515'>25:5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook</a>
<a id='line_5516'>him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from</a>
<a id='line_5517'>him.</a>
<a id='line_5518'></a>
<a id='line_5519'>25:6 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon</a>
<a id='line_5520'>to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.</a>
<a id='line_5521'></a>
<a id='line_5522'>25:7 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out</a>
<a id='line_5523'>the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried</a>
<a id='line_5524'>him to Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5525'></a>
<a id='line_5526'>25:8 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is</a>
<a id='line_5527'>the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came</a>
<a id='line_5528'>Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,</a>
<a id='line_5529'>unto Jerusalem: 25:9 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the</a>
<a id='line_5530'>king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s</a>
<a id='line_5531'>house burnt he with fire.</a>
<a id='line_5532'></a>
<a id='line_5533'>25:10 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of</a>
<a id='line_5534'>the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</a>
<a id='line_5535'></a>
<a id='line_5536'>25:11 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the</a>
<a id='line_5537'>fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of</a>
<a id='line_5538'>the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.</a>
<a id='line_5539'></a>
<a id='line_5540'>25:12 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the</a>
<a id='line_5541'>land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.</a>
<a id='line_5542'></a>
<a id='line_5543'>25:13 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_5544'>the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did</a>
<a id='line_5545'>the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to</a>
<a id='line_5546'>Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_5547'></a>
<a id='line_5548'>25:14 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,</a>
<a id='line_5549'>and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they</a>
<a id='line_5550'>away.</a>
<a id='line_5551'></a>
<a id='line_5552'>25:15 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of</a>
<a id='line_5553'>gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took</a>
<a id='line_5554'>away.</a>
<a id='line_5555'></a>
<a id='line_5556'>25:16 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made</a>
<a id='line_5557'>for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without</a>
<a id='line_5558'>weight.</a>
<a id='line_5559'></a>
<a id='line_5560'>25:17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the</a>
<a id='line_5561'>chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three</a>
<a id='line_5562'>cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter</a>
<a id='line_5563'>round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar</a>
<a id='line_5564'>with wreathen work.</a>
<a id='line_5565'></a>
<a id='line_5566'>25:18 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and</a>
<a id='line_5567'>Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 25:19</a>
<a id='line_5568'>And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of</a>
<a id='line_5569'>war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, which were</a>
<a id='line_5570'>found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which</a>
<a id='line_5571'>mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of</a>
<a id='line_5572'>the land that were found in the city: 25:20 And Nebuzaradan captain of</a>
<a id='line_5573'>the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to</a>
<a id='line_5574'>Riblah: 25:21 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at</a>
<a id='line_5575'>Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their</a>
<a id='line_5576'>land.</a>
<a id='line_5577'></a>
<a id='line_5578'>25:22 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom</a>
<a id='line_5579'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made</a>
<a id='line_5580'>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.</a>
<a id='line_5581'></a>
<a id='line_5582'>25:23 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,</a>
<a id='line_5583'>heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came</a>
<a id='line_5584'>to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan</a>
<a id='line_5585'>the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite,</a>
<a id='line_5586'>and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</a>
<a id='line_5587'></a>
<a id='line_5588'>25:24 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_5589'>them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land,</a>
<a id='line_5590'>and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</a>
<a id='line_5591'></a>
<a id='line_5592'>25:25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son</a>
<a id='line_5593'>of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten</a>
<a id='line_5594'>men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the</a>
<a id='line_5595'>Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</a>
<a id='line_5596'></a>
<a id='line_5597'>25:26 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of</a>
<a id='line_5598'>the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the</a>
<a id='line_5599'>Chaldees.</a>
<a id='line_5600'></a>
<a id='line_5601'>25:27 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the</a>
<a id='line_5602'>captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the</a>
<a id='line_5603'>seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of</a>
<a id='line_5604'>Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of</a>
<a id='line_5605'>Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 25:28 And he spake kindly to</a>
<a id='line_5606'>him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with</a>
<a id='line_5607'>him in Babylon; 25:29 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat</a>
<a id='line_5608'>bread continually before him all the days of his life.</a>
<a id='line_5609'></a>
<a id='line_5610'>25:30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the</a>
<a id='line_5611'>king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</a>
