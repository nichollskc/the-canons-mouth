                    <a id='line_0'>Chapter XXIX: Division Of Roman Empire Between Sons Of</a>
<a id='line_1'>      Theodosius.—Part I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>     Final Division Of The Roman Empire Between The Sons Of</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Theodosius.—Reign Of Arcadius And Honorius—Administration Of</a>
<a id='line_5'>     Rufinus And Stilicho.—Revolt And Defeat Of Gildo In Africa.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The genius of Rome expired with Theodosius; the last of the</a>
<a id='line_8'>      successors of Augustus and Constantine, who appeared in the field</a>
<a id='line_9'>      at the head of their armies, and whose authority was universally</a>
<a id='line_10'>      acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire. The</a>
<a id='line_11'>      memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      feeble and inexperienced youth of his two sons. After the death</a>
<a id='line_13'>      of their father, Arcadius and Honorius were saluted, by the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      unanimous consent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the East,</a>
<a id='line_15'>      and of the West; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by</a>
<a id='line_16'>      every order of the state; the senates of old and new Rome, the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people. Arcadius,</a>
<a id='line_18'>      who was then about eighteen years of age, was born in Spain, in</a>
<a id='line_19'>      the humble habitation of a private family. But he received a</a>
<a id='line_20'>      princely education in the palace of Constantinople; and his</a>
<a id='line_21'>      inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of</a>
<a id='line_22'>      royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube to</a>
<a id='line_24'>      the confines of Persia and Æthiopia. His younger brother</a>
<a id='line_25'>      Honorius, assumed, in the eleventh year of his age, the nominal</a>
<a id='line_26'>      government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom, were opposed,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      on one side, to the Caledonians, and on the other, to the Moors.</a>
<a id='line_29'>      The great and martial præfecture of Illyricum was divided</a>
<a id='line_30'>      between the two princes: the defence and possession of the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      provinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia still belonged to</a>
<a id='line_32'>      the Western empire; but the two large dioceses of Dacia and</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Macedonia, which Gratian had intrusted to the valor of</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Theodosius, were forever united to the empire of the East. The</a>
<a id='line_35'>      boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now</a>
<a id='line_36'>      separates the Germans and the Turks; and the respective</a>
<a id='line_37'>      advantages of territory, riches, populousness, and military</a>
<a id='line_38'>      strength, were fairly balanced and compensated, in this final and</a>
<a id='line_39'>      permanent division of the Roman empire. The hereditary sceptre of</a>
<a id='line_40'>      the sons of Theodosius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      their father; the generals and ministers had been accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_42'>      adore the majesty of the royal infants; and the army and people</a>
<a id='line_43'>      were not admonished of their rights, and of their power, by the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      dangerous example of a recent election. The gradual discovery of</a>
<a id='line_45'>      the weakness of Arcadius and Honorius, and the repeated</a>
<a id='line_46'>      calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to obliterate the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      deep and early impressions of loyalty. The subjects of Rome, who</a>
<a id='line_48'>      still reverenced the persons, or rather the names, of their</a>
<a id='line_49'>      sovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who</a>
<a id='line_50'>      opposed, and the ministers who abused, the authority of the</a>
<a id='line_51'>      throne.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>      Theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign by the elevation</a>
<a id='line_54'>      of Rufinus; an odious favorite, who, in an age of civil and</a>
<a id='line_55'>      religious faction, has deserved, from every party, the imputation</a>
<a id='line_56'>      of every crime. The strong impulse of ambition and avarice 1 had</a>
<a id='line_57'>      urged Rufinus to abandon his native country, an obscure corner of</a>
<a id='line_58'>      Gaul, 2 to advance his fortune in the capital of the East: the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      talent of bold and ready elocution, 3 qualified him to succeed in</a>
<a id='line_60'>      the lucrative profession of the law; and his success in that</a>
<a id='line_61'>      profession was a regular step to the most honorable and important</a>
<a id='line_62'>      employments of the state. He was raised, by just degrees, to the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      station of master of the offices. In the exercise of his various</a>
<a id='line_64'>      functions, so essentially connected with the whole system of</a>
<a id='line_65'>      civil government, he acquired the confidence of a monarch, who</a>
<a id='line_66'>      soon discovered his diligence and capacity in business, and who</a>
<a id='line_67'>      long remained ignorant of the pride, the malice, and the</a>
<a id='line_68'>      covetousness of his disposition. These vices were concealed</a>
<a id='line_69'>      beneath the mask of profound dissimulation; 4 his passions were</a>
<a id='line_70'>      subservient only to the passions of his master; yet in the horrid</a>
<a id='line_71'>      massacre of Thessalonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury,</a>
<a id='line_72'>      without imitating the repentance, of Theodosius. The minister,</a>
<a id='line_73'>      who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind, never</a>
<a id='line_74'>      forgave the appearance of an injury; and his personal enemies had</a>
<a id='line_75'>      forfeited, in his opinion, the merit of all public services.</a>
<a id='line_76'>      Promotus, the master-general of the infantry, had saved the</a>
<a id='line_77'>      empire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but he indignantly</a>
<a id='line_78'>      supported the preeminence of a rival, whose character and</a>
<a id='line_79'>      profession he despised; and in the midst of a public council, the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      indecent pride of the favorite. This act of violence was</a>
<a id='line_82'>      represented to the emperor as an insult, which it was incumbent</a>
<a id='line_83'>      on his dignity to resent. The disgrace and exile of Promotus were</a>
<a id='line_84'>      signified by a peremptory order, to repair, without delay, to a</a>
<a id='line_85'>      military station on the banks of the Danube; and the death of</a>
<a id='line_86'>      that general (though he was slain in a skirmish with the</a>
<a id='line_87'>      Barbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus. 5 The</a>
<a id='line_88'>      sacrifice of a hero gratified his revenge; the honors of the</a>
<a id='line_89'>      consulship elated his vanity; but his power was still imperfect</a>
<a id='line_90'>      and precarious, as long as the important posts of præfect of the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      East, and of præfect of Constantinople, were filled by Tatian, 6</a>
<a id='line_92'>      and his son Proculus; whose united authority balanced, for some</a>
<a id='line_93'>      time, the ambition and favor of the master of the offices. The</a>
<a id='line_94'>      two præfects were accused of rapine and corruption in the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      administration of the laws and finances. For the trial of these</a>
<a id='line_96'>      illustrious offenders, the emperor constituted a special</a>
<a id='line_97'>      commission: several judges were named to share the guilt and</a>
<a id='line_98'>      reproach of injustice; but the right of pronouncing sentence was</a>
<a id='line_99'>      reserved to the president alone, and that president was Rufinus</a>
<a id='line_100'>      himself. The father, stripped of the præfecture of the East, was</a>
<a id='line_101'>      thrown into a dungeon; but the son, conscious that few ministers</a>
<a id='line_102'>      can be found innocent, where an enemy is their judge, had</a>
<a id='line_103'>      secretly escaped; and Rufinus must have been satisfied with the</a>
<a id='line_104'>      least obnoxious victim, if despotism had not condescended to</a>
<a id='line_105'>      employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice. The prosecution</a>
<a id='line_106'>      was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation, which</a>
<a id='line_107'>      flattered Tatian with the hope of a favorable event: his</a>
<a id='line_108'>      confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances, and perfidious</a>
<a id='line_109'>      oaths, of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred</a>
<a id='line_110'>      name of Theodosius himself; and the unhappy father was at last</a>
<a id='line_111'>      persuaded to recall, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus.</a>
<a id='line_112'>      He was instantly seized, examined, condemned, and beheaded, in</a>
<a id='line_113'>      one of the suburbs of Constantinople, with a precipitation which</a>
<a id='line_114'>      disappointed the clemency of the emperor. Without respecting the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      misfortunes of a consular senator, the cruel judges of Tatian</a>
<a id='line_116'>      compelled him to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cord</a>
<a id='line_117'>      was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment when he</a>
<a id='line_118'>      expected. and perhaps desired, the relief of a speedy death, he</a>
<a id='line_119'>      was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in</a>
<a id='line_120'>      poverty and exile. 7 The punishment of the two præfects might,</a>
<a id='line_121'>      perhaps, be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own</a>
<a id='line_122'>      conduct; the enmity of Rufinus might be palliated by the jealous</a>
<a id='line_123'>      and unsociable nature of ambition. But he indulged a spirit of</a>
<a id='line_124'>      revenge equally repugnant to prudence and to justice, when he</a>
<a id='line_125'>      degraded their native country of Lycia from the rank of Roman</a>
<a id='line_126'>      provinces; stigmatized a guiltless people with a mark of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      ignominy; and declared, that the countrymen of Tatian and</a>
<a id='line_128'>      Proculus should forever remain incapable of holding any</a>
<a id='line_129'>      employment of honor or advantage under the Imperial government. 8</a>
<a id='line_130'>      The new præfect of the East (for Rufinus instantly succeeded to</a>
<a id='line_131'>      the vacant honors of his adversary) was not diverted, however, by</a>
<a id='line_132'>      the most criminal pursuits, from the performance of the religious</a>
<a id='line_133'>      duties, which in that age were considered as the most essential</a>
<a id='line_134'>      to salvation. In the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, he</a>
<a id='line_135'>      had built a magnificent villa; to which he devoutly added a</a>
<a id='line_136'>      stately church, consecrated to the apostles St. Peter and St.</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Paul, and continually sanctified by the prayers and penance of a</a>
<a id='line_138'>      regular society of monks. A numerous, and almost general, synod</a>
<a id='line_139'>      of the bishops of the Eastern empire, was summoned to celebrate,</a>
<a id='line_140'>      at the same time, the dedication of the church, and the baptism</a>
<a id='line_141'>      of the founder. This double ceremony was performed with</a>
<a id='line_142'>      extraordinary pomp; and when Rufinus was purified, in the holy</a>
<a id='line_143'>      font, from all the sins that he had hitherto committed, a</a>
<a id='line_144'>      venerable hermit of Egypt rashly proposed himself as the sponsor</a>
<a id='line_145'>      of a proud and ambitious statesman. 9</a>

<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>      The character of Theodosius imposed on his minister the task of</a>
<a id='line_204'>      hypocrisy, which disguised, and sometimes restrained, the abuse</a>
<a id='line_205'>      of power; and Rufinus was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent</a>
<a id='line_206'>      slumber of a prince still capable of exerting the abilities and</a>
<a id='line_207'>      the virtue, which had raised him to the throne. 10 But the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      absence, and, soon afterwards, the death, of the emperor,</a>
<a id='line_209'>      confirmed the absolute authority of Rufinus over the person and</a>
<a id='line_210'>      dominions of Arcadius; a feeble youth, whom the imperious</a>
<a id='line_211'>      præfect considered as his pupil, rather than his sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_212'>      Regardless of the public opinion, he indulged his passions</a>
<a id='line_213'>      without remorse, and without resistance; and his malignant and</a>
<a id='line_214'>      rapacious spirit rejected every passion that might have</a>
<a id='line_215'>      contributed to his own glory, or the happiness of the people. His</a>
<a id='line_216'>      avarice, 11 which seems to have prevailed, in his corrupt mind,</a>
<a id='line_217'>      over every other sentiment, attracted the wealth of the East, by</a>
<a id='line_218'>      the various arts of partial and general extortion; oppressive</a>
<a id='line_219'>      taxes, scandalous bribery, immoderate fines, unjust</a>
<a id='line_220'>      confiscations, forced or fictitious testaments, by which the</a>
<a id='line_221'>      tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of</a>
<a id='line_222'>      strangers, or enemies; and the public sale of justice, as well as</a>
<a id='line_223'>      of favor, which he instituted in the palace of Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_224'>      The ambitious candidate eagerly solicited, at the expense of the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      fairest part of his patrimony, the honors and emoluments of some</a>
<a id='line_226'>      provincial government; the lives and fortunes of the unhappy</a>
<a id='line_227'>      people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser; and the</a>
<a id='line_228'>      public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an</a>
<a id='line_229'>      unpopular criminal, whose punishment was profitable only to the</a>
<a id='line_230'>      præfect of the East, his accomplice and his judge. If avarice</a>
<a id='line_231'>      were not the blindest of the human passions, the motives of</a>
<a id='line_232'>      Rufinus might excite our curiosity; and we might be tempted to</a>
<a id='line_233'>      inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity</a>
<a id='line_234'>      and justice, to accumulate those immense treasures, which he</a>
<a id='line_235'>      could not spend without folly, nor possess without danger.</a>
<a id='line_236'>      Perhaps he vainly imagined, that he labored for the interest of</a>
<a id='line_237'>      an only daughter, on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil,</a>
<a id='line_238'>      and the august rank of Empress of the East. Perhaps he deceived</a>
<a id='line_239'>      himself by the opinion, that his avarice was the instrument of</a>
<a id='line_240'>      his ambition. He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and</a>
<a id='line_241'>      independent basis, which should no longer depend on the caprice</a>
<a id='line_242'>      of the young emperor; yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts</a>
<a id='line_243'>      of the soldiers and people, by the liberal distribution of those</a>
<a id='line_244'>      riches, which he had acquired with so much toil, and with so much</a>
<a id='line_245'>      guilt. The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only the</a>
<a id='line_246'>      reproach and envy of ill-gotten wealth; his dependants served him</a>
<a id='line_247'>      without attachment; the universal hatred of mankind was repressed</a>
<a id='line_248'>      only by the influence of servile fear. The fate of Lucian</a>
<a id='line_249'>      proclaimed to the East, that the præfect, whose industry was</a>
<a id='line_250'>      much abated in the despatch of ordinary business, was active and</a>
<a id='line_251'>      indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge. Lucian, the son of the</a>
<a id='line_252'>      præfect Florentius, the oppressor of Gaul, and the enemy of</a>
<a id='line_253'>      Julian, had employed a considerable part of his inheritance, the</a>
<a id='line_254'>      fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the friendship of</a>
<a id='line_255'>      Rufinus, and the high office of Count of the East. But the new</a>
<a id='line_256'>      magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and</a>
<a id='line_257'>      of the times; disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a</a>
<a id='line_258'>      virtuous and temperate administration; and presumed to refuse an</a>
<a id='line_259'>      act of injustice, which might have tended to the profit of the</a>
<a id='line_260'>      emperor’s uncle. Arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the</a>
<a id='line_261'>      supposed insult; and the præfect of the East resolved to execute</a>
<a id='line_262'>      in person the cruel vengeance, which he meditated against this</a>
<a id='line_263'>      ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed with incessant</a>
<a id='line_264'>      speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles, from</a>
<a id='line_265'>      Constantinople to Antioch, entered the capital of Syria at the</a>
<a id='line_266'>      dead of night, and spread universal consternation among a people</a>
<a id='line_267'>      ignorant of his design, but not ignorant of his character. The</a>
<a id='line_268'>      Count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dragged, like the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus.</a>
<a id='line_270'>      Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity, which was</a>
<a id='line_271'>      not impeached even by the voice of an accuser, Lucian was</a>
<a id='line_272'>      condemned, almost with out a trial, to suffer a cruel and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      ignominious punishment. The ministers of the tyrant, by the</a>
<a id='line_274'>      orders, and in the presence, of their master, beat him on the</a>
<a id='line_275'>      neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead; and</a>
<a id='line_276'>      when he fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in</a>
<a id='line_277'>      a close litter, to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the</a>
<a id='line_278'>      indignant city. No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman</a>
<a id='line_279'>      act, the sole object of his expedition, than he returned, amidst</a>
<a id='line_280'>      the deep and silent curses of a trembling people, from Antioch to</a>

<a id='line_320'>      They discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the</a>
<a id='line_321'>      daughter of Rufinus, who had been chosen, without his consent,</a>
<a id='line_322'>      for his bride; and they contrived to substitute in her place the</a>
<a id='line_323'>      fair Eudoxia, the daughter of Bauto, 13 a general of the Franks</a>
<a id='line_324'>      in the service of Rome; and who was educated, since the death of</a>
<a id='line_325'>      her father, in the family of the sons of Promotus. The young</a>
<a id='line_326'>      emperor, whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious</a>
<a id='line_327'>      care of his tutor Arsenius, 14 eagerly listened to the artful and</a>
<a id='line_328'>      flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia: he gazed with</a>
<a id='line_329'>      impatient ardor on her picture, and he understood the necessity</a>
<a id='line_330'>      of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a</a>
<a id='line_331'>      minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation</a>
<a id='line_332'>      of his happiness. Soon after the return of Rufinus, the</a>
<a id='line_333'>      approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the</a>
<a id='line_334'>      people of Constantinople, who prepared to celebrate, with false</a>
<a id='line_335'>      and hollow acclamations, the fortune of his daughter. A splendid</a>
<a id='line_336'>      train of eunuchs and officers issued, in hymeneal pomp, from the</a>
<a id='line_337'>      gates of the palace; bearing aloft the diadem, the robes, and the</a>
<a id='line_338'>      inestimable ornaments, of the future empress. The solemn</a>
<a id='line_339'>      procession passed through the streets of the city, which were</a>
<a id='line_340'>      adorned with garlands, and filled with spectators; but when it</a>
<a id='line_341'>      reached the house of the sons of Promotus, the principal eunuch</a>
<a id='line_342'>      respectfully entered the mansion, invested the fair Eudoxia with</a>
<a id='line_343'>      the Imperial robes, and conducted her in triumph to the palace</a>
<a id='line_344'>      and bed of Arcadius. 15 The secrecy and success with which this</a>
<a id='line_345'>      conspiracy against Rufinus had been conducted, imprinted a mark</a>
<a id='line_346'>      of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister, who had</a>
<a id='line_347'>      suffered himself to be deceived, in a post where the arts of</a>
<a id='line_348'>      deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit.</a>
<a id='line_349'>      He considered, with a mixture of indignation and fear, the</a>
<a id='line_350'>      victory of an aspiring eunuch, who had secretly captivated the</a>
<a id='line_351'>      favor of his sovereign; and the disgrace of his daughter, whose</a>
<a id='line_352'>      interest was inseparably connected with his own, wounded the</a>
<a id='line_353'>      tenderness, or, at least, the pride of Rufinus. At the moment</a>
<a id='line_354'>      when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a</a>
<a id='line_355'>      line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the house</a>
<a id='line_356'>      of his implacable enemies, was introduced into the Imperial bed;</a>
<a id='line_357'>      and Eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit, to</a>
<a id='line_358'>      improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind</a>
<a id='line_359'>      of a fond and youthful husband. The emperor would soon be</a>
<a id='line_360'>      instructed to hate, to fear, and to destroy the powerful subject,</a>
<a id='line_361'>      whom he had injured; and the consciousness of guilt deprived</a>
<a id='line_362'>      Rufinus of every hope, either of safety or comfort, in the</a>
<a id='line_363'>      retirement of a private life. But he still possessed the most</a>
<a id='line_364'>      effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of</a>
<a id='line_365'>      oppressing his enemies. The præfect still exercised an</a>
<a id='line_366'>      uncontrolled authority over the civil and military government of</a>
<a id='line_367'>      the East; and his treasures, if he could resolve to use them,</a>

<a id='line_369'>      of the blackest designs, that pride, ambition, and revenge could</a>
<a id='line_370'>      suggest to a desperate statesman. The character of Rufinus seemed</a>
<a id='line_371'>      to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person</a>
<a id='line_372'>      of his sovereign, to seat himself on the vacant throne; and that</a>
<a id='line_373'>      he had secretly invited the Huns and the Goths to invade the</a>

<a id='line_421'>      was neither able, nor desirous, to boast of a long series of</a>
<a id='line_422'>      illustrious progenitors; and the slight mention of his father, an</a>

<a id='line_426'>      perfidious race of the Vandals. 18 If Stilicho had not possessed</a>

<a id='line_428'>      flattering bard, in the presence of so many thousand spectators,</a>
<a id='line_429'>      would have hesitated to affirm, that he surpassed the measure of</a>
<a id='line_430'>      the demi-gods of antiquity; and that whenever he moved, with</a>
<a id='line_431'>      lofty steps, through the streets of the capital, the astonished</a>
<a id='line_432'>      crowd made room for the stranger, who displayed, in a private</a>
<a id='line_433'>      condition, the awful majesty of a hero. From his earliest youth</a>
<a id='line_434'>      he embraced the profession of arms; his prudence and valor were</a>
<a id='line_435'>      soon distinguished in the field; the horsemen and archers of the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      East admired his superior dexterity; and in each degree of his</a>
<a id='line_437'>      military promotions, the public judgment always prevented and</a>
<a id='line_438'>      approved the choice of the sovereign. He was named, by</a>
<a id='line_439'>      Theodosius, to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia;</a>
<a id='line_440'>      he supported, during that important embassy, the dignity of the</a>
<a id='line_441'>      Roman name; and after he returned to Constantinople, his merit</a>
<a id='line_442'>      was rewarded by an intimate and honorable alliance with the</a>
<a id='line_443'>      Imperial family. Theodosius had been prompted, by a pious motive</a>
<a id='line_444'>      of fraternal affection, to adopt, for his own, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_445'>      his brother Honorius; the beauty and accomplishments of Serena 19</a>
<a id='line_446'>      were universally admired by the obsequious court; and Stilicho</a>
<a id='line_447'>      obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals, who ambitiously</a>
<a id='line_448'>      disputed the hand of the princess, and the favor of her adopted</a>
<a id='line_449'>      father. 20 The assurance that the husband of Serena would be</a>
<a id='line_450'>      faithful to the throne, which he was permitted to approach,</a>
<a id='line_451'>      engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes, and to employ the</a>
<a id='line_452'>      abilities, of the sagacious and intrepid Stilicho. He rose,</a>
<a id='line_453'>      through the successive steps of master of the horse, and count of</a>
<a id='line_454'>      the domestics, to the supreme rank of master-general of all the</a>
<a id='line_455'>      cavalry and infantry of the Roman, or at least of the Western,</a>
<a id='line_456'>      empire; 21 and his enemies confessed, that he invariably</a>
<a id='line_457'>      disdained to barter for gold the rewards of merit, or to defraud</a>
<a id='line_458'>      the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or</a>
<a id='line_459'>      claimed, from the liberality of the state. 22 The valor and</a>
<a id='line_460'>      conduct which he afterwards displayed, in the defence of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_461'>      against the arms of Alaric and Radagaisus, may justify the fame</a>
<a id='line_462'>      of his early achievements and in an age less attentive to the</a>
<a id='line_463'>      laws of honor, or of pride, the Roman generals might yield the</a>
<a id='line_464'>      preeminence of rank, to the ascendant of superior genius. 23 He</a>
<a id='line_465'>      lamented, and revenged, the murder of Promotus, his rival and his</a>
<a id='line_466'>      friend; and the massacre of many thousands of the flying</a>
<a id='line_467'>      Bastarnae is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice, which</a>
<a id='line_468'>      the Roman Achilles offered to the manes of another Patroclus. The</a>
<a id='line_469'>      virtues and victories of Stilicho deserved the hatred of Rufinus:</a>
<a id='line_470'>      and the arts of calumny might have been successful if the tender</a>
<a id='line_471'>      and vigilant Serena had not protected her husband against his</a>
<a id='line_472'>      domestic foes, whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of</a>
<a id='line_473'>      the empire. 24 Theodosius continued to support an unworthy</a>
<a id='line_474'>      minister, to whose diligence he delegated the government of the</a>
<a id='line_475'>      palace, and of the East; but when he marched against the tyrant</a>
<a id='line_476'>      Eugenius, he associated his faithful general to the labors and</a>
<a id='line_477'>      glories of the civil war; and in the last moments of his life,</a>
<a id='line_478'>      the dying monarch recommended to Stilicho the care of his sons,</a>
<a id='line_479'>      and of the republic. 25 The ambition and the abilities of</a>
<a id='line_480'>      Stilicho were not unequal to the important trust; and he claimed</a>
<a id='line_481'>      the guardianship of the two empires, during the minority of</a>
<a id='line_482'>      Arcadius and Honorius. 26 The first measure of his</a>
<a id='line_483'>      administration, or rather of his reign, displayed to the nations</a>
<a id='line_484'>      the vigor and activity of a spirit worthy to command. He passed</a>
<a id='line_485'>      the Alps in the depth of winter; descended the stream of the</a>
<a id='line_486'>      Rhine, from the fortress of Basil to the marshes of Batavia;</a>
<a id='line_487'>      reviewed the state of the garrisons; repressed the enterprises of</a>
<a id='line_488'>      the Germans; and, after establishing along the banks a firm and</a>
<a id='line_489'>      honorable peace, returned, with incredible speed, to the palace</a>
<a id='line_490'>      of Milan. 27 The person and court of Honorius were subject to the</a>
<a id='line_491'>      master-general of the West; and the armies and provinces of</a>
<a id='line_492'>      Europe obeyed, without hesitation, a regular authority, which was</a>

<a id='line_568'>      Theodosius.—Part II.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>      The impartiality which Stilicho affected, as the common guardian</a>
<a id='line_571'>      of the royal brothers, engaged him to regulate the equal division</a>
<a id='line_572'>      of the arms, the jewels, and the magnificent wardrobe and</a>
<a id='line_573'>      furniture of the deceased emperor. 28 But the most important</a>
<a id='line_574'>      object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions,</a>
<a id='line_575'>      cohorts, and squadrons, of Romans, or Barbarians, whom the event</a>
<a id='line_576'>      of the civil war had united under the standard of Theodosius. The</a>
<a id='line_577'>      various multitudes of Europe and Asia, exasperated by recent</a>
<a id='line_578'>      animosities, were overawed by the authority of a single man; and</a>
<a id='line_579'>      the rigid discipline of Stilicho protected the lands of the</a>
<a id='line_580'>      citizens from the rapine of the licentious soldier. 29 Anxious,</a>
<a id='line_581'>      however, and impatient, to relieve Italy from the presence of</a>
<a id='line_582'>      this formidable host, which could be useful only on the frontiers</a>
<a id='line_583'>      of the empire, he listened to the just requisition of the</a>
<a id='line_584'>      minister of Arcadius, declared his intention of reconducting in</a>
<a id='line_585'>      person the troops of the East, and dexterously employed the rumor</a>
<a id='line_586'>      of a Gothic tumult to conceal his private designs of ambition and</a>
<a id='line_587'>      revenge. 30 The guilty soul of Rufinus was alarmed by the</a>
<a id='line_588'>      approach of a warrior and a rival, whose enmity he deserved; he</a>
<a id='line_589'>      computed, with increasing terror, the narrow space of his life</a>
<a id='line_590'>      and greatness; and, as the last hope of safety, he interposed the</a>
<a id='line_591'>      authority of the emperor Arcadius. Stilicho, who appears to have</a>
<a id='line_592'>      directed his march along the sea-coast of the Adriatic, was not</a>
<a id='line_593'>      far distant from the city of Thessalonica, when he received a</a>
<a id='line_594'>      peremptory message, to recall the troops of the East, and to</a>
<a id='line_595'>      declare, that his nearer approach would be considered, by the</a>
<a id='line_596'>      Byzantine court, as an act of hostility. The prompt and</a>
<a id='line_597'>      unexpected obedience of the general of the West, convinced the</a>
<a id='line_598'>      vulgar of his loyalty and moderation; and, as he had already</a>
<a id='line_599'>      engaged the affection of the Eastern troops, he recommended to</a>
<a id='line_600'>      their zeal the execution of his bloody design, which might be</a>
<a id='line_601'>      accomplished in his absence, with less danger, perhaps, and with</a>
<a id='line_602'>      less reproach. Stilicho left the command of the troops of the</a>
<a id='line_603'>      East to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity he firmly relied,</a>
<a id='line_604'>      with an assurance, at least, that the hardy Barbarians would</a>
<a id='line_605'>      never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear</a>
<a id='line_606'>      or remorse. The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the</a>
<a id='line_607'>      enemy of Stilicho and of Rome; and such was the general hatred</a>
<a id='line_608'>      which Rufinus had excited, that the fatal secret, communicated to</a>
<a id='line_609'>      thousands, was faithfully preserved during the long march from</a>
<a id='line_610'>      Thessalonica to the gates of Constantinople. As soon as they had</a>
<a id='line_611'>      resolved his death, they condescended to flatter his pride; the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      ambitious præfect was seduced to believe, that those powerful</a>
<a id='line_613'>      auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and</a>
<a id='line_614'>      the treasures which he distributed, with a tardy and reluctant</a>
<a id='line_615'>      hand, were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult,</a>
<a id='line_616'>      rather than as a gift. At the distance of a mile from the</a>
<a id='line_617'>      capital, in the field of Mars, before the palace of Hebdomon, the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      troops halted: and the emperor, as well as his minister,</a>
<a id='line_619'>      advanced, according to ancient custom, respectfully to salute the</a>
<a id='line_620'>      power which supported their throne. As Rufinus passed along the</a>
<a id='line_621'>      ranks, and disguised, with studied courtesy, his innate</a>
<a id='line_622'>      haughtiness, the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and</a>
<a id='line_623'>      left, and enclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their</a>
<a id='line_624'>      arms. Before he could reflect on the danger of his situation,</a>
<a id='line_625'>      Gainas gave the signal of death; a daring and forward soldier</a>
<a id='line_626'>      plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty præfect, and</a>
<a id='line_627'>      Rufinus fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of the affrighted</a>
<a id='line_628'>      emperor. If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a</a>
<a id='line_629'>      whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse</a>
<a id='line_630'>      could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be</a>
<a id='line_631'>      affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder</a>
<a id='line_632'>      of Rufinus. His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of</a>
<a id='line_633'>      the populace of either sex, who hastened in crowds, from every</a>
<a id='line_634'>      quarter of the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty</a>
<a id='line_635'>      minister, at whose frown they had so lately trembled. His right</a>
<a id='line_636'>      hand was cut off, and carried through the streets of</a>
<a id='line_637'>      Constantinople, in cruel mockery, to extort contributions for the</a>
<a id='line_638'>      avaricious tyrant, whose head was publicly exposed, borne aloft</a>

<a id='line_689'>      might vindicate the honor of Providence, but it did not much</a>

<a id='line_694'>      silenced, under heavy penalties, the presumptuous claims of the</a>
<a id='line_695'>      subjects of the Eastern empire, who had been injured by his</a>
<a id='line_696'>      rapacious tyranny. 34 Even Stilicho did not derive from the</a>
<a id='line_697'>      murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed; and though</a>
<a id='line_698'>      he gratified his revenge, his ambition was disappointed. Under</a>
<a id='line_699'>      the name of a favorite, the weakness of Arcadius required a</a>
<a id='line_700'>      master, but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the</a>
<a id='line_701'>      eunuch Eutropius, who had obtained his domestic confidence: and</a>
<a id='line_702'>      the emperor contemplated, with terror and aversion, the stern</a>
<a id='line_703'>      genius of a foreign warrior. Till they were divided by the</a>
<a id='line_704'>      jealousy of power, the sword of Gainas, and the charms of</a>
<a id='line_705'>      Eudoxia, supported the favor of the great chamberlain of the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      palace: the perfidious Goth, who was appointed master-general of</a>
<a id='line_707'>      the East, betrayed, without scruple, the interest of his</a>
<a id='line_708'>      benefactor; and the same troops, who had so lately massacred the</a>
<a id='line_709'>      enemy of Stilicho, were engaged to support, against him, the</a>
<a id='line_710'>      independence of the throne of Constantinople. The favorites of</a>
<a id='line_711'>      Arcadius fomented a secret and irreconcilable war against a</a>
<a id='line_712'>      formidable hero, who aspired to govern, and to defend, the two</a>
<a id='line_713'>      empires of Rome, and the two sons of Theodosius. They incessantly</a>
<a id='line_714'>      labored, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive him of</a>
<a id='line_715'>      the esteem of the prince, the respect of the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_716'>      friendship of the Barbarians. The life of Stilicho was repeatedly</a>
<a id='line_717'>      attempted by the dagger of hired assassins; and a decree was</a>
<a id='line_718'>      obtained from the senate of Constantinople, to declare him an</a>
<a id='line_719'>      enemy of the republic, and to confiscate his ample possessions in</a>
<a id='line_720'>      the provinces of the East. At a time when the only hope of</a>
<a id='line_721'>      delaying the ruin of the Roman name depended on the firm union,</a>
<a id='line_722'>      and reciprocal aid, of all the nations to whom it had been</a>

<a id='line_761'>      inclinations of a prince, and people, who rejected his</a>
<a id='line_762'>      government, wisely abandoned Arcadius to his unworthy favorites;</a>
<a id='line_763'>      and his reluctance to involve the two empires in a civil war</a>
<a id='line_764'>      displayed the moderation of a minister, who had so often</a>
<a id='line_765'>      signalized his military spirit and abilities. But if Stilicho had</a>
<a id='line_766'>      any longer endured the revolt of Africa, he would have betrayed</a>
<a id='line_767'>      the security of the capital, and the majesty of the Western</a>
<a id='line_768'>      emperor, to the capricious insolence of a Moorish rebel. Gildo,</a>
<a id='line_769'>      37 the brother of the tyrant Firmus, had preserved and obtained,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      as the reward of his apparent fidelity, the immense patrimony</a>
<a id='line_771'>      which was forfeited by treason: long and meritorious service, in</a>
<a id='line_772'>      the armies of Rome, raised him to the dignity of a military</a>
<a id='line_773'>      count; the narrow policy of the court of Theodosius had adopted</a>
<a id='line_774'>      the mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the</a>
<a id='line_775'>      interest of a powerful family; and the brother of Firmus was</a>
<a id='line_776'>      invested with the command of Africa. His ambition soon usurped</a>
<a id='line_777'>      the administration of justice, and of the finances, without</a>
<a id='line_778'>      account, and without control; and he maintained, during a reign</a>
<a id='line_779'>      of twelve years, the possession of an office, from which it was</a>
<a id='line_780'>      impossible to remove him, without the danger of a civil war.</a>
<a id='line_781'>      During those twelve years, the provinces of Africa groaned under</a>
<a id='line_782'>      the dominion of a tyrant, who seemed to unite the unfeeling</a>
<a id='line_783'>      temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic</a>
<a id='line_784'>      faction. The forms of law were often superseded by the use of</a>
<a id='line_785'>      poison; and if the trembling guests, who were invited to the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      table of Gildo, presumed to express fears, the insolent suspicion</a>
<a id='line_787'>      served only to excite his fury, and he loudly summoned the</a>
<a id='line_788'>      ministers of death. Gildo alternately indulged the passions of</a>
<a id='line_789'>      avarice and lust; 38 and if his days were terrible to the rich,</a>
<a id='line_790'>      his nights were not less dreadful to husbands and parents. The</a>
<a id='line_791'>      fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      embraces of the tyrant; and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious</a>
<a id='line_793'>      troop of Barbarians and assassins, the black, or swarthy, natives</a>
<a id='line_794'>      of the desert; whom Gildo considered as the only guardians of his</a>
<a id='line_795'>      throne. In the civil war between Theodosius and Eugenius, the</a>
<a id='line_796'>      count, or rather the sovereign, of Africa, maintained a haughty</a>
<a id='line_797'>      and suspicious neutrality; refused to assist either of the</a>
<a id='line_798'>      contending parties with troops or vessels, expected the</a>
<a id='line_799'>      declaration of fortune, and reserved for the conqueror the vain</a>
<a id='line_800'>      professions of his allegiance. Such professions would not have</a>
<a id='line_801'>      satisfied the master of the Roman world; but the death of</a>
<a id='line_802'>      Theodosius, and the weakness and discord of his sons, confirmed</a>
<a id='line_803'>      the power of the Moor; who condescended, as a proof of his</a>
<a id='line_804'>      moderation, to abstain from the use of the diadem, and to supply</a>
<a id='line_805'>      Rome with the customary tribute, or rather subsidy, of corn. In</a>
<a id='line_806'>      every division of the empire, the five provinces of Africa were</a>
<a id='line_807'>      invariably assigned to the West; and Gildo had to govern that</a>
<a id='line_808'>      extensive country in the name of Honorius, but his knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_809'>      the character and designs of Stilicho soon engaged him to address</a>
<a id='line_810'>      his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign. The ministers</a>
<a id='line_811'>      of Arcadius embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel; and the</a>
<a id='line_812'>      delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of Africa to the</a>

<a id='line_903'>      chosen body of Gallic veterans, who had lately served under the</a>
<a id='line_904'>      standard of Eugenius. These troops, who were exhorted to convince</a>
<a id='line_905'>      the world that they could subvert, as well as defend the throne</a>
<a id='line_906'>      of a usurper, consisted of the Jovian, the Herculian, and the</a>
<a id='line_907'>      Augustan legions; of the Nervian auxiliaries; of the soldiers who</a>
<a id='line_908'>      displayed in their banners the symbol of a lion, and of the</a>
<a id='line_909'>      troops which were distinguished by the auspicious names of</a>
<a id='line_910'>      Fortunate, and Invincible. Yet such was the smallness of their</a>
<a id='line_911'>      establishments, or the difficulty of recruiting, that these seven</a>
<a id='line_912'>      bands, 44 of high dignity and reputation in the service of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_913'>      amounted to no more than five thousand effective men. 45 The</a>
<a id='line_914'>      fleet of galleys and transports sailed in tempestuous weather</a>
<a id='line_915'>      from the port of Pisa, in Tuscany, and steered their course to</a>
<a id='line_916'>      the little island of Capraria; which had borrowed that name from</a>
<a id='line_917'>      the wild goats, its original inhabitants, whose place was</a>
<a id='line_918'>      occupied by a new colony of a strange and savage appearance. “The</a>
<a id='line_919'>      whole island (says an ingenious traveller of those times) is</a>
<a id='line_920'>      filled, or rather defiled, by men who fly from the light. They</a>

<a id='line_924'>      they should be miserable, they embrace a life of voluntary</a>

<a id='line_1010'>      the rest of the province, the dominion of Honorius, and the</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      authority of his lieutenant. The inhabitants, as a proof of their</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      repentance and loyalty, seized and confined the person of Gildo</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      in a dungeon; and his own despair saved him from the intolerable</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      torture of supporting the presence of an injured and victorious</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      brother. 53 The captives and the spoils of Africa were laid at</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      the feet of the emperor; but Stilicho, whose moderation appeared</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      more conspicuous and more sincere, in the midst of prosperity,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      still affected to consult the laws of the republic; and referred</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      to the senate and people of Rome the judgment of the most</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      illustrious criminals. 54 Their trial was public and solemn; but</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      the judges, in the exercise of this obsolete and precarious</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      jurisdiction, were impatient to punish the African magistrates,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      who had intercepted the subsistence of the Roman people. The rich</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      and guilty province was oppressed by the Imperial ministers, who</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      had a visible interest to multiply the number of the accomplices</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      of Gildo; and if an edict of Honorius seems to check the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      malicious industry of informers, a subsequent edict, at the</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      distance of ten years, continues and renews the prosecution of</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      the offences which had been committed in the time of the general</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      rebellion. 55 The adherents of the tyrant who escaped the first</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      fury of the soldiers, and the judges, might derive some</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      consolation from the tragic fate of his brother, who could never</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      obtain his pardon for the extraordinary services which he had</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      performed. After he had finished an important war in the space of</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      a single winter, Mascezel was received at the court of Milan with</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      loud applause, affected gratitude, and secret jealousy; 56 and</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      his death, which, perhaps, was the effect of passage of a bridge,</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      the Moorish prince, who accompanied the master-general of the</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      West, was suddenly thrown from his horse into the river; the</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      officious haste of the attendants was restrained by a cruel and</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      perfidious smile which they observed on the countenance of</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      Stilicho; and while they delayed the necessary assistance, the</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      unfortunate Mascezel was irrecoverably drowned. 57</a>

<a id='line_1094'>      seemed to invest the powerful minister with the authority of a</a>

<a id='line_1097'>      strains, the happiness of the royal pair; and the glory of the</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      hero, who confirmed their union, and supported their throne. The</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      ancient fables of Greece, which had almost ceased to be the</a>

<a id='line_1105'>      heart, in the just and pleasing language of allegorical fiction.</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      But the amorous impatience which Claudian attributes to the young</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      prince, 59 must excite the smiles of the court; and his beauteous</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      spouse (if she deserved the praise of beauty) had not much to</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      fear or to hope from the passions of her lover. Honorius was only</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      in the fourteenth year of his age; Serena, the mother of his</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      bride, deferred, by art of persuasion, the consummation of the</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      royal nuptials; Maria died a virgin, after she had been ten years</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      a wife; and the chastity of the emperor was secured by the</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      coldness, or perhaps, the debility, of his constitution. 60 His</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      subjects, who attentively studied the character of their young</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      sovereign, discovered that Honorius was without passions, and</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      consequently without talents; and that his feeble and languid</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      rank, or of enjoying the pleasures of his age. In his early youth</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      he made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      bow: but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations, and</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      care of the monarch of the West, 61 who resigned the reins of</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho. The</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      prince who was born in the purple, received a worse education</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      than the meanest peasant of his dominions; and that the ambitious</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      minister suffered him to attain the age of manhood, without</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      attempting to excite his courage, or to enlighten his</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      understanding. 62 The predecessors of Honorius were accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      animate by their example, or at least by their presence, the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      valor of the legions; and the dates of their laws attest the</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      Roman world. But the son of Theodosius passed the slumber of his</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      life, a captive in his palace, a stranger in his country, and the</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      patient, almost the indifferent, spectator of the ruin of the</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      Western empire, which was repeatedly attacked, and finally</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      subverted, by the arms of the Barbarians. In the eventful history</a>
