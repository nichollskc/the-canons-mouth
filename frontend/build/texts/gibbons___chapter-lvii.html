<a id='line_9'>      From the Isle of Sicily, the reader must transport himself beyond</a>
<a id='line_10'>      the Caspian Sea, to the original seat of the Turks or Turkmans,</a>
<a id='line_11'>      against whom the first crusade was principally directed. Their</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Scythian empire of the sixth century was long since dissolved;</a>
<a id='line_13'>      but the name was still famous among the Greeks and Orientals; and</a>
<a id='line_14'>      the fragments of the nation, each a powerful and independent</a>
<a id='line_15'>      people, were scattered over the desert from China to the Oxus and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      the Danube: the colony of Hungarians was admitted into the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      republic of Europe, and the thrones of Asia were occupied by</a>
<a id='line_18'>      slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction. While Apulia and</a>
<a id='line_19'>      Sicily were subdued by the Norman lance, a swarm of these</a>
<a id='line_20'>      northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia; their</a>
<a id='line_21'>      princes of the race of Seljuk erected a splendid and solid empire</a>
<a id='line_22'>      from Samarcand to the confines of Greece and Egypt; and the Turks</a>
<a id='line_23'>      have maintained their dominion in Asia Minor, till the victorious</a>
<a id='line_24'>      crescent has been planted on the dome of St. Sophia.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>      One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud,</a>
<a id='line_27'>      1 the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      one thousand years after the birth of Christ. His father</a>
<a id='line_29'>      Sebectagi was the slave of the slave of the slave of the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      commander of the faithful. But in this descent of servitude, the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      first degree was merely titular, since it was filled by the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan, who still paid a nominal</a>
<a id='line_33'>      allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad. The second rank was that of a</a>
<a id='line_34'>      minister of state, a lieutenant of the Samanides, 2 who broke, by</a>
<a id='line_35'>      his revolt, the bonds of political slavery. But the third step</a>
<a id='line_36'>      was a state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that</a>
<a id='line_37'>      rebel; from which Sebectagi, by his courage and dexterity,</a>
<a id='line_38'>      ascended to the supreme command of the city and provinces of</a>
<a id='line_39'>      Gazna, 3 as the son-in-law and successor of his grateful master.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>      The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected, and</a>
<a id='line_42'>      at last overthrown, by their servants; and, in the public</a>
<a id='line_43'>      disorders, the fortune of Mahmud continually increased. From him</a>
<a id='line_44'>      the title of Sultan 4 was first invented; and his kingdom was</a>
<a id='line_45'>      enlarged from Transoxiana to the neighborhood of Ispahan, from</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of the Indus. But the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      principal source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he</a>
<a id='line_48'>      waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan. In this foreign narrative</a>
<a id='line_49'>      I may not consume a page; and a volume would scarcely suffice to</a>
<a id='line_50'>      recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions.</a>
<a id='line_51'>      Never was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      seasons, the height of the mountains, the breadth of the rivers,</a>
<a id='line_53'>      the barrenness of the desert, the multitudes of the enemy, or the</a>
<a id='line_54'>      formidable array of their elephants of war. 5 The sultan of Gazna</a>
<a id='line_55'>      surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander: after a march</a>
<a id='line_56'>      of three months, over the hills of Cashmir and Thibet, he reached</a>
<a id='line_57'>      the famous city of Kinnoge, 6 on the Upper Ganges; and, in a</a>
<a id='line_58'>      naval combat on one of the branches of the Indus, he fought and</a>
<a id='line_59'>      vanquished four thousand boats of the natives. Delhi, Lahor, and</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Multan, were compelled to open their gates: the fertile kingdom</a>
<a id='line_61'>      of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay; and his</a>
<a id='line_62'>      avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden</a>
<a id='line_63'>      and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean. On the payment of a</a>
<a id='line_64'>      tribute, the rajahs preserved their dominions; the people, their</a>
<a id='line_65'>      lives and fortunes; but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous</a>
<a id='line_66'>      Mussulman was cruel and inexorable: many hundred temples, or</a>
<a id='line_67'>      pagodas, were levelled with the ground; many thousand idols were</a>
<a id='line_68'>      demolished; and the servants of the prophet were stimulated and</a>
<a id='line_69'>      rewarded by the precious materials of which they were composed.</a>
<a id='line_70'>      The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the promontory of Guzarat, in</a>
<a id='line_71'>      the neighborhood of Diu, one of the last remaining possessions of</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the Portuguese. 7 It was endowed with the revenue of two thousand</a>
<a id='line_73'>      villages; two thousand Brahmins were consecrated to the service</a>
<a id='line_74'>      of the Deity, whom they washed each morning and evening in water</a>
<a id='line_75'>      from the distant Ganges: the subordinate ministers consisted of</a>
<a id='line_76'>      three hundred musicians, three hundred barbers, and five hundred</a>
<a id='line_77'>      dancing girls, conspicuous for their birth or beauty. Three sides</a>
<a id='line_78'>      of the temple were protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was</a>
<a id='line_79'>      fortified by a natural or artificial precipice; and the city and</a>
<a id='line_80'>      adjacent country were peopled by a nation of fanatics. They</a>
<a id='line_81'>      confessed the sins and the punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi; but</a>
<a id='line_82'>      if the impious stranger should presume to approach their holy</a>
<a id='line_83'>      precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed by a blast of the</a>
<a id='line_84'>      divine vengeance. By this challenge, the faith of Mahmud was</a>
<a id='line_85'>      animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian</a>
<a id='line_86'>      deity. Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the</a>
<a id='line_87'>      spear of the Moslems; the walls were scaled; the sanctuary was</a>
<a id='line_88'>      profaned; and the conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the</a>
<a id='line_89'>      head of the idol. The trembling Brahmins are said to have offered</a>
<a id='line_90'>      ten millions 711 sterling for his ransom; and it was urged by the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      wisest counsellors, that the destruction of a stone image would</a>
<a id='line_92'>      not change the hearts of the Gentoos; and that such a sum might</a>
<a id='line_93'>      be dedicated to the relief of the true believers. “Your reasons,”</a>
<a id='line_94'>      replied the sultan, “are specious and strong; but never in the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant of idols.”</a>
<a id='line_96'>      712 He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and rubies,</a>
<a id='line_97'>      concealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree</a>
<a id='line_98'>      the devout prodigality of the Brahmins. The fragments of the idol</a>
<a id='line_99'>      were distributed to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina. Bagdad listened to</a>
<a id='line_100'>      the edifying tale; and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      title of guardian of the fortune and faith of Mahomet.</a>

<a id='line_193'>      the East: his subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and</a>
<a id='line_194'>      peace; his vices were concealed by the veil of religion; and two</a>

<a id='line_198'>      throne to accuse the insolence of a Turkish soldier who had</a>
<a id='line_199'>      driven him from his house and bed. “Suspend your clamors,” said</a>
<a id='line_200'>      Mahmud; “inform me of his next visit, and ourself in person will</a>
<a id='line_201'>      judge and punish the offender.” The sultan followed his guide,</a>
<a id='line_202'>      invested the house with his guards, and extinguishing the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      torches, pronounced the death of the criminal, who had been</a>
<a id='line_204'>      seized in the act of rapine and adultery. After the execution of</a>
<a id='line_205'>      his sentence, the lights were rekindled, Mahmud fell prostrate in</a>
<a id='line_206'>      prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some homely fare,</a>
<a id='line_207'>      which he devoured with the voraciousness of hunger. The poor man,</a>
<a id='line_208'>      whose injury he had avenged, was unable to suppress his</a>
<a id='line_209'>      astonishment and curiosity; and the courteous monarch</a>
<a id='line_210'>      condescended to explain the motives of this singular behavior. “I</a>
<a id='line_211'>      had reason to suspect that none, except one of my sons, could</a>
<a id='line_212'>      dare to perpetrate such an outrage; and I extinguished the</a>
<a id='line_213'>      lights, that my justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer</a>
<a id='line_214'>      was a thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender; and so</a>
<a id='line_215'>      painful was my anxiety, that I had passed three days without food</a>

<a id='line_218'>      II. The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty of</a>
<a id='line_219'>      the Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia: he was</a>
<a id='line_220'>      disarmed by an epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his</a>
<a id='line_221'>      invasion till the manhood of her son. 8 “During the life of my</a>
<a id='line_222'>      husband,” said the artful regent, “I was ever apprehensive of</a>
<a id='line_223'>      your ambition: he was a prince and a soldier worthy of your arms.</a>
<a id='line_224'>      He is now no more; his sceptre has passed to a woman and a child,</a>
<a id='line_225'>      and you dare not attack their infancy and weakness. How</a>
<a id='line_226'>      inglorious would be your conquest, how shameful your defeat! and</a>
<a id='line_227'>      yet the event of war is in the hand of the Almighty.” Avarice was</a>
<a id='line_228'>      the only defect that tarnished the illustrious character of</a>
<a id='line_229'>      Mahmud; and never has that passion been more richly satiated. 811</a>
<a id='line_230'>      The Orientals exceed the measure of credibility in the account of</a>
<a id='line_231'>      millions of gold and silver, such as the avidity of man has never</a>
<a id='line_232'>      accumulated; in the magnitude of pearls, diamonds, and rubies,</a>
<a id='line_233'>      such as have never been produced by the workmanship of nature. 9</a>
<a id='line_234'>      Yet the soil of Hindostan is impregnated with precious minerals:</a>
<a id='line_235'>      her trade, in every age, has attracted the gold and silver of the</a>
<a id='line_236'>      world; and her virgin spoils were rifled by the first of the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      Mahometan conquerors. His behavior, in the last days of his life,</a>
<a id='line_238'>      evinces the vanity of these possessions, so laboriously won, so</a>
<a id='line_239'>      dangerously held, and so inevitably lost. He surveyed the vast</a>
<a id='line_240'>      and various chambers of the treasury of Gazna, burst into tears,</a>

<a id='line_295'>      to the tenth century of the Christian aera. 12 In the decline of</a>
<a id='line_296'>      the caliphs, and the weakness of their lieutenants, the barrier</a>
<a id='line_297'>      of the Jaxartes was often violated; in each invasion, after the</a>
<a id='line_298'>      victory or retreat of their countrymen, some wandering tribe,</a>
<a id='line_299'>      embracing the Mahometan faith, obtained a free encampment in the</a>
<a id='line_300'>      spacious plains and pleasant climate of Transoxiana and Carizme.</a>
<a id='line_301'>      The Turkish slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged these</a>
<a id='line_302'>      emigrations which recruited their armies, awed their subjects and</a>
<a id='line_303'>      rivals, and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of</a>
<a id='line_304'>      Turkestan; and this policy was abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide</a>
<a id='line_305'>      beyond the example of former times. He was admonished of his</a>
<a id='line_306'>      error by the chief of the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in the</a>
<a id='line_307'>      territory of Bochara. The sultan had inquired what supply of men</a>
<a id='line_308'>      he could furnish for military service. “If you send,” replied</a>
<a id='line_309'>      Ismael, “one of these arrows into our camp, fifty thousand of</a>
<a id='line_310'>      your servants will mount on horseback.”—“And if that number,”</a>
<a id='line_311'>      continued Mahmud, “should not be sufficient?”—“Send this second</a>
<a id='line_312'>      arrow to the horde of Balik, and you will find fifty thousand</a>
<a id='line_313'>      more.”—“But,” said the Gaznevide, dissembling his anxiety, “if I</a>
<a id='line_314'>      should stand in need of the whole force of your kindred</a>
<a id='line_315'>      tribes?”—“Despatch my bow,” was the last reply of Ismael, “and as</a>
<a id='line_316'>      it is circulated around, the summons will be obeyed by two</a>
<a id='line_317'>      hundred thousand horse.” The apprehension of such formidable</a>
<a id='line_318'>      friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most obnoxious tribes</a>
<a id='line_319'>      into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be separated from</a>
<a id='line_320'>      their brethren of the River Oxus, and enclosed on all sides by</a>
<a id='line_321'>      the walls of obedient cities. But the face of the country was an</a>
<a id='line_322'>      object of temptation rather than terror; and the vigor of</a>
<a id='line_323'>      government was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of</a>
<a id='line_324'>      Gazna. The shepherds were converted into robbers; the bands of</a>
<a id='line_325'>      robbers were collected into an army of conquerors: as far as</a>
<a id='line_326'>      Ispahan and the Tigris, Persia was afflicted by their predatory</a>
<a id='line_327'>      inroads; and the Turkmans were not ashamed or afraid to measure</a>
<a id='line_328'>      their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns of Asia.</a>
<a id='line_329'>      Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud, had too long neglected</a>
<a id='line_330'>      the advice of his wisest Omrahs. “Your enemies,” they repeatedly</a>
<a id='line_331'>      urged, “were in their origin a swarm of ants; they are now little</a>
<a id='line_332'>      snakes; and, unless they be instantly crushed, they will acquire</a>
<a id='line_333'>      the venom and magnitude of serpents.” After some alternatives of</a>
<a id='line_334'>      truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his</a>
<a id='line_335'>      lieutenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans,</a>
<a id='line_336'>      who attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular</a>
<a id='line_337'>      onset. “Massoud,” says the Persian historian, 13 “plunged singly</a>
<a id='line_338'>      to oppose the torrent of gleaming arms, exhibiting such acts of</a>
<a id='line_339'>      gigantic force and valor as never king had before displayed. A</a>

<a id='line_342'>      well, that wheresoever he turned his fatal sword, the enemies</a>
<a id='line_343'>      were mowed down, or retreated before him. But now, when victory</a>

<a id='line_396'>      the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and</a>

<a id='line_398'>      Seljuk was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his</a>
<a id='line_399'>      friends and vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the</a>
<a id='line_400'>      neighborhood of Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and</a>
<a id='line_401'>      acquired the crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels.</a>
<a id='line_402'>      His age, of a hundred and seven years, surpassed the life of his</a>
<a id='line_403'>      son, and Seljuk adopted the care of his two grandsons, Togrul and</a>
<a id='line_404'>      Jaafar; the eldest of whom, at the age of forty-five, was</a>
<a id='line_405'>      invested with the title of Sultan, in the royal city of Nishabur.</a>
<a id='line_406'>      The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues of</a>

<a id='line_408'>      valor of a Turk; and the ambition of Togrul 18 was equal to his</a>
<a id='line_409'>      valor. By his arms, the Gasnevides were expelled from the eastern</a>
<a id='line_410'>      kingdoms of Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_411'>      Indus, in search of a softer and more wealthy conquest. In the</a>
<a id='line_412'>      West he annihilated the dynasty of the Bowides; and the sceptre</a>
<a id='line_413'>      of Irak passed from the Persian to the Turkish nation. The</a>
<a id='line_414'>      princes who had felt, or who feared, the Seljukian arrows, bowed</a>
<a id='line_415'>      their heads in the dust; by the conquest of Aderbijan, or Media,</a>
<a id='line_416'>      he approached the Roman confines; and the shepherd presumed to</a>
<a id='line_417'>      despatch an ambassador, or herald, to demand the tribute and</a>
<a id='line_418'>      obedience of the emperor of Constantinople. 19 In his own</a>
<a id='line_419'>      dominions, Togrul was the father of his soldiers and people; by a</a>
<a id='line_420'>      firm and equal administration, Persia was relieved from the evils</a>
<a id='line_421'>      of anarchy; and the same hands which had been imbrued in blood</a>
<a id='line_422'>      became the guardians of justice and the public peace. The more</a>
<a id='line_423'>      rustic, perhaps the wisest, portion of the Turkmans 20 continued</a>
<a id='line_424'>      to dwell in the tents of their ancestors; and, from the Oxus to</a>
<a id='line_425'>      the Euphrates, these military colonies were protected and</a>
<a id='line_426'>      propagated by their native princes. But the Turks of the court</a>
<a id='line_427'>      and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure: they</a>
<a id='line_428'>      imitated the dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the</a>
<a id='line_429'>      royal palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order and</a>
<a id='line_430'>      magnificence of a great monarchy. The most deserving of the</a>
<a id='line_431'>      Arabians and Persians were promoted to the honors of the state;</a>
<a id='line_432'>      and the whole body of the Turkish nation embraced, with fervor</a>
<a id='line_433'>      and sincerity, the religion of Mahomet. The northern swarms of</a>
<a id='line_434'>      Barbarians, who overspread both Europe and Asia, have been</a>
<a id='line_435'>      irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar</a>

<a id='line_488'>      and each of the rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the</a>
<a id='line_489'>      judgment of the strong, though illiterate Barbarians. Mahmud the</a>
<a id='line_490'>      Gaznevide had declared himself in favor of the line of Abbas; and</a>
<a id='line_491'>      had treated with indignity the robe of honor which was presented</a>
<a id='line_492'>      by the Fatimite ambassador. Yet the ungrateful Hashemite had</a>
<a id='line_493'>      changed with the change of fortune; he applauded the victory of</a>
<a id='line_494'>      Zendecan, and named the Seljukian sultan his temporal vicegerent</a>
<a id='line_495'>      over the Moslem world. As Togrul executed and enlarged this</a>
<a id='line_496'>      important trust, he was called to the deliverance of the caliph</a>
<a id='line_497'>      Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new kingdom to</a>
<a id='line_498'>      his arms. 22 In the palace of Bagdad, the commander of the</a>
<a id='line_499'>      faithful still slumbered, a venerable phantom. His servant or</a>
<a id='line_500'>      master, the prince of the Bowides, could no longer protect him</a>
<a id='line_501'>      from the insolence of meaner tyrants; and the Euphrates and</a>
<a id='line_502'>      Tigris were oppressed by the revolt of the Turkish and Arabian</a>
<a id='line_503'>      emirs. The presence of a conqueror was implored as a blessing;</a>
<a id='line_504'>      and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were excused as the</a>
<a id='line_505'>      sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the health</a>
<a id='line_506'>      of the republic. At the head of an irresistible force, the sultan</a>
<a id='line_507'>      of Persia marched from Hamadan: the proud were crushed, the</a>
<a id='line_508'>      prostrate were spared; the prince of the Bowides disappeared; the</a>
<a id='line_509'>      heads of the most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of</a>
<a id='line_510'>      Togrul; and he inflicted a lesson of obedience on the people of</a>
<a id='line_511'>      Mosul and Bagdad. After the chastisement of the guilty, and the</a>
<a id='line_512'>      restoration of peace, the royal shepherd accepted the reward of</a>
<a id='line_513'>      his labors; and a solemn comedy represented the triumph of</a>
<a id='line_514'>      religious prejudice over Barbarian power. 23 The Turkish sultan</a>
<a id='line_515'>      embarked on the Tigris, landed at the gate of Racca, and made his</a>
<a id='line_516'>      public entry on horseback. At the palace-gate he respectfully</a>
<a id='line_517'>      dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded by his emirs without</a>
<a id='line_518'>      arms. The caliph was seated behind his black veil: the black</a>
<a id='line_519'>      garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders, and he</a>
<a id='line_520'>      held in his hand the staff of the apostle of God. The conqueror</a>
<a id='line_521'>      of the East kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest</a>
<a id='line_522'>      posture, and was led towards the throne by the vizier and</a>
<a id='line_523'>      interpreter. After Togrul had seated himself on another throne,</a>
<a id='line_524'>      his commission was publicly read, which declared him the temporal</a>
<a id='line_525'>      lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet. He was successively</a>
<a id='line_526'>      invested with seven robes of honor, and presented with seven</a>
<a id='line_527'>      slaves, the natives of the seven climates of the Arabian empire.</a>
<a id='line_528'>      His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; two crowns 231 were</a>
<a id='line_529'>      placed on his head; two cimeters were girded to his side, as the</a>
<a id='line_530'>      symbols of a double reign over the East and West. After this</a>
<a id='line_531'>      inauguration, the sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a</a>
<a id='line_532'>      second time; but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the</a>
<a id='line_533'>      faithful, and his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds</a>
<a id='line_534'>      and the applause of the Moslems. In a second visit to Bagdad, the</a>
<a id='line_535'>      Seljukian prince again rescued the caliph from his enemies and</a>
<a id='line_536'>      devoutly, on foot, led the bridle of his mule from the prison to</a>
<a id='line_537'>      the palace. Their alliance was cemented by the marriage of</a>
<a id='line_538'>      Togrul’s sister with the successor of the prophet. Without</a>
<a id='line_539'>      reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his harem; but</a>
<a id='line_540'>      Cayem proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained to</a>
<a id='line_541'>      mingle the blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian</a>
<a id='line_542'>      shepherd; and protracted the negotiation many months, till the</a>
<a id='line_543'>      gradual diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was</a>
<a id='line_544'>      still in the hands of a master. The royal nuptials were followed</a>
<a id='line_545'>      by the death of Togrul himself; 24 as he left no children, his</a>
<a id='line_546'>      nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title and prerogatives of</a>
<a id='line_547'>      sultan; and his name, after that of the caliph, was pronounced in</a>
<a id='line_548'>      the public prayers of the Moslems. Yet in this revolution, the</a>
<a id='line_549'>      Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and power. On the</a>
<a id='line_550'>      throne of Asia, the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of the</a>
<a id='line_551'>      domestic administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the</a>
<a id='line_552'>      faithful were relieved from the ignominious vexations to which</a>

<a id='line_582'>      Saracens respected the Asiatic provinces of Rome; which, by the</a>

<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>      Twenty-five years after the death of Basil, his successors were</a>
<a id='line_587'>      suddenly assaulted by an unknown race of Barbarians, who united</a>
<a id='line_588'>      the Scythian valor with the fanaticism of new proselytes, and the</a>
<a id='line_589'>      art and riches of a powerful monarchy. 25 The myriads of Turkish</a>
<a id='line_590'>      horse overspread a frontier of six hundred miles from Tauris to</a>
<a id='line_591'>      Arzeroum, and the blood of one hundred and thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_592'>      Christians was a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet. Yet</a>
<a id='line_593'>      the arms of Togrul did not make any deep or lasting impression on</a>
<a id='line_594'>      the Greek empire. The torrent rolled away from the open country;</a>
<a id='line_595'>      the sultan retired without glory or success from the siege of an</a>
<a id='line_596'>      Armenian city; the obscure hostilities were continued or</a>
<a id='line_597'>      suspended with a vicissitude of events; and the bravery of the</a>
<a id='line_598'>      Macedonian legions renewed the fame of the conqueror of Asia. 26</a>
<a id='line_599'>      The name of Alp Arslan, the valiant lion, is expressive of the</a>
<a id='line_600'>      popular idea of the perfection of man; and the successor of</a>
<a id='line_601'>      Togrul displayed the fierceness and generosity of the royal</a>
<a id='line_602'>      animal. He passed the Euphrates at the head of the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_603'>      cavalry, and entered Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia, to</a>
<a id='line_604'>      which he had been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple</a>
<a id='line_605'>      of St. Basil. The solid structure resisted the destroyer: but he</a>
<a id='line_606'>      carried away the doors of the shrine incrusted with gold and</a>
<a id='line_607'>      pearls, and profaned the relics of the tutelar saint, whose</a>
<a id='line_608'>      mortal frailties were now covered by the venerable rust of</a>
<a id='line_609'>      antiquity. The final conquest of Armenia and Georgia was achieved</a>
<a id='line_610'>      by Alp Arslan. In Armenia, the title of a kingdom, and the spirit</a>
<a id='line_611'>      of a nation, were annihilated: the artificial fortifications were</a>
<a id='line_612'>      yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople; by strangers</a>
<a id='line_613'>      without faith, veterans without pay or arms, and recruits without</a>
<a id='line_614'>      experience or discipline. The loss of this important frontier was</a>
<a id='line_615'>      the news of a day; and the Catholics were neither surprised nor</a>
<a id='line_616'>      displeased, that a people so deeply infected with the Nestorian</a>
<a id='line_617'>      and Eutychian errors had been delivered by Christ and his mother</a>
<a id='line_618'>      into the hands of the infidels. 27 The woods and valleys of Mount</a>
<a id='line_619'>      Caucasus were more strenuously defended by the native Georgians</a>
<a id='line_620'>      28 or Iberians; but the Turkish sultan and his son Malek were</a>
<a id='line_621'>      indefatigable in this holy war: their captives were compelled to</a>

<a id='line_737'>      Greeks; and in the defeat of Basilacius, one of their principal</a>
<a id='line_738'>      generals, he displayed the first example of his valor and</a>
<a id='line_739'>      clemency. The imprudence of the emperor had separated his forces</a>
<a id='line_740'>      after the reduction of Malazkerd. It was in vain that he</a>
<a id='line_741'>      attempted to recall the mercenary Franks: they refused to obey</a>
<a id='line_742'>      his summons; he disdained to await their return: the desertion of</a>
<a id='line_743'>      the Uzi filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion; and against</a>
<a id='line_744'>      the most salutary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and</a>
<a id='line_745'>      decisive action. Had he listened to the fair proposals of the</a>
<a id='line_746'>      sultan, Romanus might have secured a retreat, perhaps a peace;</a>
<a id='line_747'>      but in these overtures he supposed the fear or weakness of the</a>
<a id='line_748'>      enemy, and his answer was conceived in the tone of insult and</a>
<a id='line_749'>      defiance. “If the Barbarian wishes for peace, let him evacuate</a>
<a id='line_750'>      the ground which he occupies for the encampment of the Romans,</a>
<a id='line_751'>      and surrender his city and palace of Rei as a pledge of his</a>
<a id='line_752'>      sincerity.” Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand, but he</a>
<a id='line_753'>      wept the death of so many faithful Moslems; and, after a devout</a>
<a id='line_754'>      prayer, proclaimed a free permission to all who were desirous of</a>
<a id='line_755'>      retiring from the field. With his own hands he tied up his</a>
<a id='line_756'>      horse’s tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and</a>
<a id='line_757'>      cimeter, clothed himself in a white garment, perfumed his body</a>
<a id='line_758'>      with musk, and declared that if he were vanquished, that spot</a>
<a id='line_759'>      should be the place of his burial. 34 The sultan himself had</a>
<a id='line_760'>      affected to cast away his missile weapons: but his hopes of</a>
<a id='line_761'>      victory were placed in the arrows of the Turkish cavalry, whose</a>
<a id='line_762'>      squadrons were loosely distributed in the form of a crescent.</a>
<a id='line_763'>      Instead of the successive lines and reserves of the Grecian</a>
<a id='line_764'>      tactics, Romulus led his army in a single and solid phalanx, and</a>
<a id='line_765'>      pressed with vigor and impatience the artful and yielding</a>
<a id='line_766'>      resistance of the Barbarians. In this desultory and fruitless</a>
<a id='line_767'>      combat he spent the greater part of a summer’s day, till prudence</a>
<a id='line_768'>      and fatigue compelled him to return to his camp. But a retreat is</a>
<a id='line_769'>      always perilous in the face of an active foe; and no sooner had</a>
<a id='line_770'>      the standard been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken</a>
<a id='line_771'>      by the base cowardice, or the baser jealousy, of Andronicus, a</a>
<a id='line_772'>      rival prince, who disgraced his birth and the purple of the</a>
<a id='line_773'>      Caesars. 35 The Turkish squadrons poured a cloud of arrows on</a>
<a id='line_774'>      this moment of confusion and lassitude; and the horns of their</a>
<a id='line_775'>      formidable crescent were closed in the rear of the Greeks. In the</a>
<a id='line_776'>      destruction of the army and pillage of the camp, it would be</a>
<a id='line_777'>      needless to mention the number of the slain or captives. The</a>
<a id='line_778'>      Byzantine writers deplore the loss of an inestimable pearl: they</a>
<a id='line_779'>      forgot to mention, that in this fatal day the Asiatic provinces</a>

<a id='line_815'>      disorderly crowd of the meaner Barbarians. In the morning the</a>
<a id='line_816'>      royal captive was presented to Alp Arslan, who doubted of his</a>
<a id='line_817'>      fortune, till the identity of the person was ascertained by the</a>
<a id='line_818'>      report of his ambassadors, and by the more pathetic evidence of</a>
<a id='line_819'>      Basilacius, who embraced with tears the feet of his unhappy</a>
<a id='line_820'>      sovereign. The successor of Constantine, in a plebeian habit, was</a>
<a id='line_821'>      led into the Turkish divan, and commanded to kiss the ground</a>
<a id='line_822'>      before the lord of Asia. He reluctantly obeyed; and Alp Arslan,</a>
<a id='line_823'>      starting from his throne, is said to have planted his foot on the</a>
<a id='line_824'>      neck of the Roman emperor. 36 But the fact is doubtful; and if,</a>
<a id='line_825'>      in this moment of insolence, the sultan complied with the</a>
<a id='line_826'>      national custom, the rest of his conduct has extorted the praise</a>
<a id='line_827'>      of his bigoted foes, and may afford a lesson to the most</a>
<a id='line_828'>      civilized ages. He instantly raised the royal captive from the</a>
<a id='line_829'>      ground; and thrice clasping his hand with tender sympathy,</a>
<a id='line_830'>      assured him, that his life and dignity should be inviolate in the</a>
<a id='line_831'>      hands of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his</a>
<a id='line_832'>      equals and the vicissitudes of fortune. From the divan, Romanus</a>
<a id='line_833'>      was conducted to an adjacent tent, where he was served with pomp</a>
<a id='line_834'>      and reverence by the officers of the sultan, who, twice each day,</a>
<a id='line_835'>      seated him in the place of honor at his own table. In a free and</a>
<a id='line_836'>      familiar conversation of eight days, not a word, not a look, of</a>
<a id='line_837'>      insult escaped from the conqueror; but he severely censured the</a>
<a id='line_838'>      unworthy subjects who had deserted their valiant prince in the</a>
<a id='line_839'>      hour of danger, and gently admonished his antagonist of some</a>
<a id='line_840'>      errors which he had committed in the management of the war. In</a>
<a id='line_841'>      the preliminaries of negotiation, Alp Arslan asked him what</a>
<a id='line_842'>      treatment he expected to receive, and the calm indifference of</a>
<a id='line_843'>      the emperor displays the freedom of his mind. “If you are cruel,”</a>
<a id='line_844'>      said he, “you will take my life; if you listen to pride, you will</a>
<a id='line_845'>      drag me at your chariot-wheels; if you consult your interest, you</a>
<a id='line_846'>      will accept a ransom, and restore me to my country.” “And what,”</a>
<a id='line_847'>      continued the sultan, “would have been your own behavior, had</a>
<a id='line_848'>      fortune smiled on your arms?” The reply of the Greek betrays a</a>
<a id='line_849'>      sentiment, which prudence, and even gratitude, should have taught</a>
<a id='line_850'>      him to suppress. “Had I vanquished,” he fiercely said, “I would</a>
<a id='line_851'>      have inflicted on thy body many a stripe.” The Turkish conqueror</a>
<a id='line_852'>      smiled at the insolence of his captive; observed that the</a>
<a id='line_853'>      Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and forgiveness of</a>
<a id='line_854'>      injuries; and nobly declared, that he would not imitate an</a>
<a id='line_855'>      example which he condemned. After mature deliberation, Alp Arslan</a>
<a id='line_856'>      dictated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million,</a>
<a id='line_857'>      361 an annual tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces</a>
<a id='line_858'>      of gold, 37 the marriage of the royal children, and the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      deliverance of all the Moslems, who were in the power of the</a>
<a id='line_860'>      Greeks. Romanus, with a sigh, subscribed this treaty, so</a>
<a id='line_861'>      disgraceful to the majesty of the empire; he was immediately</a>
<a id='line_862'>      invested with a Turkish robe of honor; his nobles and patricians</a>
<a id='line_863'>      were restored to their sovereign; and the sultan, after a</a>
<a id='line_864'>      courteous embrace, dismissed him with rich presents and a</a>
<a id='line_865'>      military guard. No sooner did he reach the confines of the</a>
<a id='line_866'>      empire, than he was informed that the palace and provinces had</a>
<a id='line_867'>      disclaimed their allegiance to a captive: a sum of two hundred</a>
<a id='line_868'>      thousand pieces was painfully collected; and the fallen monarch</a>
<a id='line_869'>      transmitted this part of his ransom, with a sad confession of his</a>
<a id='line_870'>      impotence and disgrace. The generosity, or perhaps the ambition,</a>
<a id='line_871'>      of the sultan, prepared to espouse the cause of his ally; but his</a>
<a id='line_872'>      designs were prevented by the defeat, imprisonment, and death, of</a>

<a id='line_899'>      In the treaty of peace, it does not appear that Alp Arslan</a>
<a id='line_900'>      extorted any province or city from the captive emperor; and his</a>
<a id='line_901'>      revenge was satisfied with the trophies of his victory, and the</a>
<a id='line_902'>      spoils of Anatolia, from Antioch to the Black Sea. The fairest</a>
<a id='line_903'>      part of Asia was subject to his laws: twelve hundred princes, or</a>
<a id='line_904'>      the sons of princes, stood before his throne; and two hundred</a>
<a id='line_905'>      thousand soldiers marched under his banners. The sultan disdained</a>
<a id='line_906'>      to pursue the fugitive Greeks; but he meditated the more glorious</a>
<a id='line_907'>      conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of the house of Seljuk.</a>
<a id='line_908'>      He moved from Bagdad to the banks of the Oxus; a bridge was</a>
<a id='line_909'>      thrown over the river; and twenty days were consumed in the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      passage of his troops. But the progress of the great king was</a>
<a id='line_911'>      retarded by the governor of Berzem; and Joseph the Carizmian</a>
<a id='line_912'>      presumed to defend his fortress against the powers of the East.</a>
<a id='line_913'>      When he was produced a captive in the royal tent, the sultan,</a>
<a id='line_914'>      instead of praising his valor, severely reproached his obstinate</a>
<a id='line_915'>      folly: and the insolent replies of the rebel provoked a sentence,</a>
<a id='line_916'>      that he should be fastened to four stakes, and left to expire in</a>
<a id='line_917'>      that painful situation. At this command, the desperate Carizmian,</a>
<a id='line_918'>      drawing a dagger, rushed headlong towards the throne: the guards</a>
<a id='line_919'>      raised their battle-axes; their zeal was checked by Alp Arslan,</a>
<a id='line_920'>      the most skilful archer of the age: he drew his bow, but his foot</a>
<a id='line_921'>      slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received in his breast</a>
<a id='line_922'>      the dagger of Joseph, who was instantly cut in pieces.</a>
<a id='line_923'></a>
<a id='line_924'>      The wound was mortal; and the Turkish prince bequeathed a dying</a>
<a id='line_925'>      admonition to the pride of kings. “In my youth,” said Alp Arslan,</a>
<a id='line_926'>      “I was advised by a sage to humble myself before God; to distrust</a>
<a id='line_927'>      my own strength; and never to despise the most contemptible foe.</a>
<a id='line_928'>      I have neglected these lessons; and my neglect has been</a>
<a id='line_929'>      deservedly punished. Yesterday, as from an eminence I beheld the</a>
<a id='line_930'>      numbers, the discipline, and the spirit, of my armies, the earth</a>
<a id='line_931'>      seemed to tremble under my feet; and I said in my heart, Surely</a>
<a id='line_932'>      thou art the king of the world, the greatest and most invincible</a>
<a id='line_933'>      of warriors. These armies are no longer mine; and, in the</a>
<a id='line_934'>      confidence of my personal strength, I now fall by the hand of an</a>
<a id='line_935'>      assassin.” 39 Alp Arslan possessed the virtues of a Turk and a</a>
<a id='line_936'>      Mussulman; his voice and stature commanded the reverence of</a>
<a id='line_937'>      mankind; his face was shaded with long whiskers; and his ample</a>
<a id='line_938'>      turban was fashioned in the shape of a crown. The remains of the</a>

<a id='line_967'>      Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle, he performed his</a>
<a id='line_968'>      devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As the</a>

<a id='line_983'>      passage of the Oxus, the boatmen, who had been employed in</a>
<a id='line_984'>      transporting some troops, complained, that their payment was</a>
<a id='line_985'>      assigned on the revenues of Antioch. The sultan frowned at this</a>
<a id='line_986'>      preposterous choice; but he miled at the artful flattery of his</a>
<a id='line_987'>      vizier. “It was not to postpone their reward, that I selected</a>
<a id='line_988'>      those remote places, but to leave a memorial to posterity, that,</a>
<a id='line_989'>      under your reign, Antioch and the Oxus were subject to the same</a>
<a id='line_990'>      sovereign.” But this description of his limits was unjust and</a>
<a id='line_991'>      parsimonious: beyond the Oxus, he reduced to his obedience the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      cities of Bochara, Carizme, and Samarcand, and crushed each</a>
<a id='line_993'>      rebellious slave, or independent savage, who dared to resist.</a>
<a id='line_994'>      Malek passed the Sihon or Jaxartes, the last boundary of Persian</a>
<a id='line_995'>      civilization: the hordes of Turkestan yielded to his supremacy:</a>
<a id='line_996'>      his name was inserted on the coins, and in the prayers of</a>
<a id='line_997'>      Cashgar, a Tartar kingdom on the extreme borders of China. From</a>
<a id='line_998'>      the Chinese frontier, he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or</a>
<a id='line_999'>      feudatory sway to the west and south, as far as the mountains of</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      Georgia, the neighborhood of Constantinople, the holy city of</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      Jerusalem, and the spicy groves of Arabia Felix. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      resigning himself to the luxury of his harem, the shepherd king,</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      both in peace and war, was in action and in the field. By the</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      perpetual motion of the royal camp, each province was</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      successively blessed with his presence; and he is said to have</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      perambulated twelve times the wide extent of his dominions, which</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      surpassed the Asiatic reign of Cyrus and the caliphs. Of these</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      expeditions, the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage of</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      Mecca: the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      his arms; the citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      profusion of his alms; and the desert was cheered by the places</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      of relief and refreshment, which he instituted for the use of his</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      brethren. Hunting was the pleasure, and even the passion, of the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      sultan, and his train consisted of forty-seven thousand horses;</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      but after the massacre of a Turkish chase, for each piece of</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      game, he bestowed a piece of gold on the poor, a slight</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      atonement, at the expense of the people, for the cost and</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      mischief of the amusement of kings. In the peaceful prosperity of</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      his reign, the cities of Asia were adorned with palaces and</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      hospitals with moschs and colleges; few departed from his Divan</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      without reward, and none without justice. The language and</a>

<a id='line_1203'>      passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      joined the banner of the Crescent to that of the Cross. After his</a>

<a id='line_1206'>      hospitably entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari;</a>

<a id='line_1208'>      whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted for the</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      defeat and captivity of his rival, Bryennius. But the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      Europe was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia:</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      Constantinople was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      provinces beyond the Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the regular</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      progress of the Turks, who fortified the passes of the rivers and</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      mountains, left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion. Another</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Melissenus, in his</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      purple robes and red buskins, attended the motions of the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      Roman prince, who immediately surrendered them into the hands of</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      the Barbarians. These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of</a>

<a id='line_1470'>      of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute confinement; the</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      restraint excited the clamors of both sexes; their clamors</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      bloody conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a zealous</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      Mussulman, the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges:</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      twelve hundred and ninety copies of the Koran were transcribed at</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      his expense in letters of gold; and his edict extirpated the</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      vineyards of the Upper Egypt. But his vanity was soon flattered</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      by the hope of introducing a new religion; he aspired above the</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      fame of a prophet, and styled himself the visible image of the</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      Most High God, who, after nine apparitions on earth, was at</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      length manifest in his royal person. At the name of Hakem, the</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      lord of the living and the dead, every knee was bent in religious</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      adoration: his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo:</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession of faith; and</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      at the present hour, a free and warlike people, the Druses of</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      Mount Libanus, are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      and tyrant. 68 In his divine character, Hakem hated the Jews and</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      Christians, as the servants of his rivals; while some remains of</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      prejudice or prudence still pleaded in favor of the law of</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      Mahomet. Both in Egypt and Palestine, his cruel and wanton</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      persecution made some martyrs and many apostles: the common</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      disregarded; and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      strangers and natives. The temple of the Christian world, the</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      church of the Resurrection, was demolished to its foundations;</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      the luminous prodigy of Easter was interrupted, and much profane</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      labor was exhausted to destroy the cave in the rock which</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At the report of this</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      sacrilege, the nations of Europe were astonished and afflicted:</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      contented themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      secret advisers of the impious Barbarian. 69 Yet the calamities</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      of Jerusalem were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      or repentance of Hakem himself; and the royal mandate was sealed</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      for the restitution of the churches, when the tyrant was</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      assassinated by the emissaries of his sister. The succeeding</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and policy: a free</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      of Constantinople, the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins; and,</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      of appetite to the spiritual feast. 70 In the sea-voyage of</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      Palestine, the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare:</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      but the conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      Germany and Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      his kingdom, relieved and conducted his itinerant brethren; 71</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      and from Belgrade to Antioch, they traversed fifteen hundred</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      miles of a Christian empire. Among the Franks, the zeal of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times: and the</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of every</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      rank, who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      should have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      prelates abandoned the care of their dominions; and the numbers</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      of these pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      marched in the ensuing age under the banner of the cross. About</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      thirty years before the first crusade, the arch bishop of Mentz,</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, undertook</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan; and the</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      multitude of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons.</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      At Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      emperor; but the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      of the wild Arabs: they drew their swords with scrupulous</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      reluctance, and sustained siege in the village of Capernaum, till</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      they were rescued by the venal protection of the Fatimite emir.</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      After visiting the holy places, they embarked for Italy, but only</a>

<a id='line_1562'>      Deux tomes, Paris, 1838. The learned author has prefixed a life</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      of Hakem Biamr-Allah, which enables us to correct several errors</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      in the account of Gibbon. These errors chiefly arose from his</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      want of knowledge or of attention to the chronology of Hakem’s</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      life. Hakem succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the year of the</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      Hegira 386. He did not assume his divinity till 408. His life was</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      indeed “a wild mixture of vice and folly,” to which may be added,</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      of the most sanguinary cruelty. During his reign, 18,000 persons</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      were victims of his ferocity. Yet such is the god, observes M. de</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      Sacy, whom the Druses have worshipped for 800 years! (See p.</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      ccccxxix.) All his wildest and most extravagant actions were</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      interpreted by his followers as having a mystic and allegoric</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      meaning, alluding to the destruction of other religions and the</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      propagation of his own. It does not seem to have been the</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      “vanity” of Hakem which induced him to introduce a new religion.</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      The curious point in the new faith is that Hamza, the son of Ali,</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      the real founder of the Unitarian religion, (such is its boastful</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      title,) was content to take a secondary part. While Hakem was</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      God, the one Supreme, the Imam Hamza was his Intelligence. It was</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      not in his “divine character” that Hakem “hated the Jews and</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      Christians,” but in that of a Mahometan bigot, which he displayed</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      in the earlier years of his reign. His barbarous persecution, and</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      the burning of the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      belong entirely to that period; and his assumption of divinity</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      was followed by an edict of toleration to Jews and Christians.</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      The Mahometans, whose religion he then treated with hostility and</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      contempt, being far the most numerous, were his most dangerous</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      enemies, and therefore the objects of his most inveterate hatred.</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      It is another singular fact, that the religion of Hakem was by no</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      means confined to Egypt and Syria. M. de Sacy quotes a letter</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      addressed to the chief of the sect in India; and there is</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      likewise a letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine, son of</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      Armanous, (Romanus,) and the clergy of the empire. (Constantine</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      VIII., M. de Sacy supposes, but this is irreconcilable with</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      chronology; it must mean Constantine XI., Monomachus.) The</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      assassination of Hakem is, of course, disbelieved by his</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      sectaries. M. de Sacy seems to consider the fact obscure and</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      doubtful. According to his followers he disappeared, but is</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      hereafter to return. At his return the resurrection is to take</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      place; the triumph of Unitarianism, and the final discomfiture of</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      all other religions. The temple of Mecca is especially devoted to</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      destruction. It is remarkable that one of the signs of this final</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      consummation, and of the reappearance of Hakem, is that</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      Christianity shall be gaining a manifest predominance over</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      Mahometanism. As for the religion of the Druses, I cannot agree</a>
<a id='line_1607'>      with Gibbon that it does not “deserve” to be better known; and am</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      grateful to M. de Sacy, notwithstanding the prolixity and</a>

<a id='line_1663'>      nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes, still breathed</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      the fierceness of the desert. From Nice to Jerusalem, the western</a>
