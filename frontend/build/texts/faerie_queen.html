<a id='line_63'>INTRODUCTION</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>I. THE AGE WHICH PRODUCED THE _FAERIE QUEENE_</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>The study of the _Faerie Queene_ should be preceded by a review of the</a>
<a id='line_68'>great age in which it was written. An intimate relation exists between the</a>
<a id='line_69'>history of the English nation and the works of English authors. This close</a>
<a id='line_70'>connection between purely external events and literary masterpieces is</a>
<a id='line_71'>especially marked in a study of the Elizabethan Age. To understand the</a>
<a id='line_72'>marvelous outburst of song, the incomparable drama, and the stately prose</a>
<a id='line_73'>of this period, one must enter deeply into the political, social, and</a>
<a id='line_74'>religious life of the times.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>The _Faerie Queene_ was the product of certain definite conditions which</a>
<a id='line_77'>existed in England toward the close of the sixteenth century. The first of</a>
<a id='line_78'>these national conditions was the movement known as the _revival of</a>
<a id='line_79'>chivalry_; the second was the _spirit of nationality_ fostered by the</a>
<a id='line_80'>English Reformation; and the third was that phase of the English</a>
<a id='line_81'>Renaissance commonly called the _revival of learning_.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>The closing decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign was marked by a strong</a>
<a id='line_84'>reaction toward romanticism. The feudal system with its many imperfections</a>
<a id='line_85'>had become a memory, and had been idealized by the people. The nation felt</a>
<a id='line_86'>pride in its new aristocracy, sprung largely from the middle class, and</a>
<a id='line_87'>based rather on worth than ancestry. The bitterness of the Wars of the</a>
<a id='line_88'>Roses was forgotten, and was succeeded by an era of reconciliation and good</a>
<a id='line_89'>feeling. England was united in a heroic queen whom all sects, ranks, and</a>
<a id='line_90'>parties idolized. The whole country exulting in its new sense of freedom</a>
<a id='line_91'>and power became a fairyland of youth, springtime, and romantic</a>
<a id='line_92'>achievement.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>Wise and gallant courtiers, like Sidney, Leicester, and Raleigh, gathered</a>
<a id='line_95'>about the queen, and formed a new chivalry devoted to deeds of adventure</a>
<a id='line_96'>and exploits of mind in her honor. The spirit of the old sea-kings lived</a>
<a id='line_97'>again in Drake and his bold buccaneers, who swept the proud Spaniards from</a>
<a id='line_98'>the seas. With the defeat of the Invincible Armada, the greatest naval</a>
<a id='line_99'>expedition of modern times, the fear of Spanish and Catholic domination</a>
<a id='line_100'>rolled away. The whole land was saturated with an unexpressed poetry, and</a>
<a id='line_101'>the imagination of young and old was so fired with patriotism and noble</a>
<a id='line_102'>endeavor that nothing seemed impossible. Add to this intense delight in</a>
<a id='line_103'>life, with all its mystery, beauty, and power, the keen zest for learning</a>
<a id='line_104'>which filled the air that men breathed, and it is easy to understand that</a>
<a id='line_105'>the time was ripe for a new and brilliant epoch in literature. First among</a>
<a id='line_106'>the poetic geniuses of the Elizabethan period came Edmund Spenser with his</a>
<a id='line_107'>_Faerie Queene_, the allegory of an ideal chivalry.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>This poem is one of the fruits of that intellectual awakening which first</a>
<a id='line_110'>fertilized Italian thought in the twelfth century, and, slowly spreading</a>
<a id='line_111'>over Europe, made its way into England in the fifteenth century. The mighty</a>
<a id='line_112'>impulse of this New Learning culminated during the reign of the Virgin</a>
<a id='line_113'>Queen in a profound quickening of the national consciousness, and in</a>
<a id='line_114'>arousing an intense curiosity to know and to imitate the rich treasures of</a>
<a id='line_115'>the classics and romance. Its first phase was the _classical revival_. The</a>
<a id='line_116'>tyrannous authority of ecclesiasticism had long since been broken; a</a>
<a id='line_117'>general reaction from Christian asceticism had set in; and by the side of</a>
<a id='line_118'>the ceremonies of the church had been introduced a semi-pagan religion of</a>
<a id='line_119'>art--the worship of moral and sensuous beauty. Illiteracy was no longer the</a>
<a id='line_120'>style at court. Elizabeth herself set the example in the study of Greek.</a>
<a id='line_121'>Books and manuscripts were eagerly sought after, Scholars became conversant</a>
<a id='line_122'>with Homer, Plato, Aristotle, and the great tragic poets Sophocles,</a>
<a id='line_123'>Euripides, and Aeschylus; and translations for the many of Vergil, Ovid,</a>
<a id='line_124'>Plautus, Terence, and Seneca poured forth from the printing-presses of</a>
<a id='line_125'>London. The English mind was strongly tempered by the idealistic philosophy</a>
<a id='line_126'>of Plato and Aristotle, and the influence of Latin tragedy and comedy was</a>
<a id='line_127'>strongly felt by the early English drama.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>Along with this classical culture came a higher appreciation of the _beauty</a>
<a id='line_130'>of mediaevalism_. The romantic tendency of the age fostered the study of</a>
<a id='line_131'>the great epics of chivalry, Ariosto's _Orlando Furioso_ and Tasso's</a>
<a id='line_132'>_Jerusalem Delivered_, and of the cycles of French romance. From the</a>
<a id='line_133'>Italian poets especially Spenser borrowed freely. Ariosto's fresh</a>
<a id='line_134'>naturalness and magic machinery influenced him most strongly, but he was</a>
<a id='line_135'>indebted to the semi-classical Tasso for whole scenes. On the whole,</a>
<a id='line_136'>therefore, Spenser's literary affinities were more with the Gothic than the</a>
<a id='line_137'>classical.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>Spenser was also the spokesman of his time on religious questions. The</a>
<a id='line_140'>violent controversies of the Reformation period were over. Having turned</a>
<a id='line_141'>from the beliefs of ages with passionate rejection, the English people had</a>
<a id='line_142'>achieved religious freedom, and were strongly rooted in Protestantism,</a>
<a id='line_143'>which took on a distinctly national aspect. That Calvinism was at that time</a>
<a id='line_144'>the popular and aristocratic form of Protestantism is evident from</a>
<a id='line_145'>references in the _Faerie Queene_.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>Spenser lived in the afterglow of the great age of chivalry. The passing</a>
<a id='line_148'>glories of knighthood in its flower impressed his imagination like a</a>
<a id='line_149'>gorgeous dream, and he was thus inspired to catch and crystallize into</a>
<a id='line_150'>permanent art its romantic spirit and heroic deeds. Into the framework of</a>
<a id='line_151'>his romance of chivalry he inserted a veiled picture of the struggles and</a>
<a id='line_152'>sufferings of his own people in Ireland. The _Faerie Queene_ might almost</a>
<a id='line_153'>be called the epic of the English conquest of Ireland. The poet himself and</a>
<a id='line_154'>many of his friends were in that unhappy island as representatives of the</a>
<a id='line_155'>queen's government, trying to pacify the natives, and establish law and</a>
<a id='line_156'>order out of discontent and anarchy. Spenser's poem was written for the</a>
<a id='line_157'>most part amidst all these scenes of misery and disorder, and the courage,</a>
<a id='line_158'>justice, and energy shown by his countrymen were aptly portrayed under the</a>
<a id='line_159'>allegory of a mighty spiritual warfare of the knights of old against the</a>
<a id='line_160'>power of evil.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>Spenser's essay on _A View of the Present State of Ireland_ shows that, far</a>
<a id='line_163'>from shutting himself up in a fool's paradise of fancy, he was fully awake</a>
<a id='line_164'>to the social and political condition of that turbulent island, and that it</a>
<a id='line_165'>furnished him with concrete examples of those vices and virtues, bold</a>
<a id='line_166'>encounters and hair-breadth escapes, strange wanderings and deeds of</a>
<a id='line_167'>violence, with which he has crowded the allegory of the _Faerie Queene_.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>II. THE AUTHOR OF THE _FAERIE QUEENE_</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>Edmund Spenser was born in London near the Tower in the year 1552. His</a>
<a id='line_172'>parents were poor, though they were probably connected with the Lancashire</a>
<a id='line_173'>branch of the old family of Le Despensers, "an house of ancient fame," from</a>
<a id='line_174'>which the Northampton Spencers were also descended. The poet's familiarity</a>
<a id='line_175'>with the rural life and dialect of the north country supports the theory</a>
<a id='line_176'>that as a boy he spent some time in Lancashire. Beyond two or three facts,</a>
<a id='line_177'>nothing is known with certainty of his early years. He himself tells us</a>
<a id='line_178'>that his mother's name was Elizabeth, and that London was his "most kindly</a>
<a id='line_179'>nurse." His name is mentioned as one of six poor pupils of the Merchant</a>
<a id='line_180'>Taylors' School, who received assistance from a generous country squire.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>At the age of seventeen, Master Edmund became a student in Pembroke Hall,</a>
<a id='line_183'>one of the colleges of the great University of Cambridge. His position was</a>
<a id='line_184'>that of a sizar, or paid scholar, who was exempt from the payment of</a>
<a id='line_185'>tuition fees and earned his way by serving in the dining hall or performing</a>
<a id='line_186'>other menial duties. His poverty, however, did not prevent him from forming</a>
<a id='line_187'>many helpful friendships with his fellow-students. Among his most valued</a>
<a id='line_188'>friends he numbered Launcelot Andrews, afterward Bishop of Winchester,</a>
<a id='line_189'>Edward Kirke, a young man of Spenser's own age, who soon after edited his</a>
<a id='line_190'>friend's first important poem, the _Shepheards Calender_, with elaborate</a>
<a id='line_191'>notes, and most important of all, the famous classical scholar, a fellow of</a>
<a id='line_192'>Pembroke, Gabriel Harvey, who was a few years older than Spenser, and was</a>
<a id='line_193'>later immortalized as the Hobbinoll of the _Faerie Queene_. It was by</a>
<a id='line_194'>Harvey that the poet was introduced to Sir Philip Sidney, the most</a>
<a id='line_195'>accomplished gentleman in England, and a favorite of Queen Elizabeth.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>Spenser's residence in Cambridge extended over seven years, during which he</a>
<a id='line_198'>received the usual degrees of bachelor and master of arts. He became one of</a>
<a id='line_199'>the most learned of English poets, and we may infer that while at this seat</a>
<a id='line_200'>of learning he laid the foundations for his wide scholarship in the</a>
<a id='line_201'>diligent study of the Greek and Latin classics, the philosophy of Plato and</a>
<a id='line_202'>Aristotle, the pastoral poetry of Theocritus and Vergil, and the great</a>
<a id='line_203'>mediaeval epics of Italian literature. On account of some misunderstanding</a>
<a id='line_204'>with the master and tutors of his college, Spenser failed to receive the</a>
<a id='line_205'>appointment to a fellowship, and left the University in 1576, at the age of</a>
<a id='line_206'>twenty-four. His failure to attain the highest scholastic recognition was</a>
<a id='line_207'>due, it is supposed, to his being involved in some of the dangerous</a>
<a id='line_208'>controversies which were ripe in Cambridge at that time "with daily</a>
<a id='line_209'>spawning of new opinions and heresies in divinity, in philosophy, in</a>
<a id='line_210'>humanity, and in manners."</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>On leaving the University, Spenser resided for about a year with relatives</a>
<a id='line_213'>in Lancashire, where he found employment. During this time he had an</a>
<a id='line_214'>unrequited love affair with an unknown beauty whom he celebrated in the</a>
<a id='line_215'>_Shepheards Calender_ under the name of Rosalind, "the widow's daughter of</a>
<a id='line_216'>the glen." A rival, Menalchas, was more successful in finding favor with</a>
<a id='line_217'>his fair neighbor. Although he had before this turned his attention to</a>
<a id='line_218'>poetry by translating the sonnets of Petrarch and Du Bellay (published in</a>
<a id='line_219'>1569), it was while here in the North country that he first showed his high</a>
<a id='line_220'>poetic gifts in original composition.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>After a visit to Sir Philip Sidney at Penshurst, Spenser went down to</a>
<a id='line_223'>London with his friend in 1578, and was presented to Sidney's great uncle,</a>
<a id='line_224'>the Earl of Leicester. He thus at once had an opportunity for advancement</a>
<a id='line_225'>through the influence of powerful patrons, a necessity with poor young</a>
<a id='line_226'>authors in that age. An immediate result of his acquaintance with Sidney,</a>
<a id='line_227'>with whom he was now on relations of intimate friendship, was an</a>
<a id='line_228'>introduction into the best society of the metropolis. This period of</a>
<a id='line_229'>association with many of the most distinguished and cultivated men in</a>
<a id='line_230'>England, together with the succession of brilliant pageants, masks, and</a>
<a id='line_231'>processions, which he witnessed at court and at Lord Leicester's mansion,</a>
<a id='line_232'>must have done much to refine his tastes and broaden his outlook on the</a>
<a id='line_233'>world.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>In personal appearance Spenser was a fine type of a sixteenth century</a>
<a id='line_236'>gentleman. The grace and dignity of his bearing was enhanced by a face of</a>
<a id='line_237'>tender and thoughtful expression in which warmth of feeling was subdued by</a>
<a id='line_238'>the informing spirit of refinement, truthfulness, simplicity, and nobility.</a>
<a id='line_239'>He possessed a fine dome-like forehead, curling hair, brown eyes, full</a>
<a id='line_240'>sensuous lips, and a nose that was straight and strongly moulded. His long</a>
<a id='line_241'>spare face was adorned with a full mustache and a closely cropped Van Dyke</a>
<a id='line_242'>beard.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>The _Shepheards Calender_ was published in the winter of 1579 with a</a>
<a id='line_245'>grateful and complimentary dedication to Sidney. It is an academic exercise</a>
<a id='line_246'>consisting of a series of twelve pastoral poems in imitation of the</a>
<a id='line_247'>eclogues of Vergil and Theocritus. The poem is cast in the form of</a>
<a id='line_248'>dialogues between shepherds, who converse on such subjects as love,</a>
<a id='line_249'>religion, and old age. In three eclogues the poet attacks with Puritan zeal</a>
<a id='line_250'>the pomp and sloth of the worldly clergy, and one is devoted to the courtly</a>
<a id='line_251'>praise of the queen. It was at once recognized as the most notable poem</a>
<a id='line_252'>that had appeared since the death of Chaucer, and placed Spenser</a>
<a id='line_253'>immediately at the head of living English poets.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>In 1580 Spenser went over to Ireland as private secretary to Lord Grey of</a>
<a id='line_256'>Wilton, the Artegall of the Legend of Justice in the _Faerie Queene_. After</a>
<a id='line_257'>the recall of his patron he remained in that turbulent island in various</a>
<a id='line_258'>civil positions for the rest of his life, with the exception of two or</a>
<a id='line_259'>three visits and a last sad flight to England. For seven years he was clerk</a>
<a id='line_260'>of the Court of Chancery in Dublin, and then was appointed clerk to the</a>
<a id='line_261'>Council of Munster. In 1586 he was granted the forfeited estate of the Earl</a>
<a id='line_262'>of Desmond in Cork County, and two years later took up his residence in</a>
<a id='line_263'>Kilcolman Castle, which was beautifully situated on a lake with a distant</a>
<a id='line_264'>view of mountains. In the disturbed political condition of the country,</a>
<a id='line_265'>life here seemed a sort of exile to the poet, but its very loneliness and</a>
<a id='line_266'>danger gave the stimulus needed for the development of his peculiar genius.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>"Here," says Mr. Stopford Brooke, "at the foot of the Galtees, and bordered</a>
<a id='line_269'>to the north by the wild country, the scenery of which is frequently</a>
<a id='line_270'>painted in the _Faerie Queene_ and in whose woods and savage places such</a>
<a id='line_271'>adventures constantly took place in the service of Elizabeth as are</a>
<a id='line_272'>recorded in the _Faerie Queene_, the first three books of that great poem</a>
<a id='line_273'>were finished." Spenser had spent the first three years of his residence at</a>
<a id='line_274'>Kilcolman at work on this masterpiece, which had been begun in England,</a>
<a id='line_275'>under the encouragement of Sidney, probably before 1580. The knightly</a>
<a id='line_276'>Sidney died heroically at the battle of Zutphen, in 1586, and Spenser</a>
<a id='line_277'>voiced the lament of all England in the beautiful pastoral elegy</a>
<a id='line_278'>_Astrophel_ which he composed in memory of "the most noble and valorous</a>
<a id='line_279'>knight."</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>Soon after coming to Ireland, Spenser made the acquaintance of Sir Walter</a>
<a id='line_282'>Raleigh, which erelong ripened into intimate friendship. A memorable visit</a>
<a id='line_283'>from Raleigh, who was now a neighbor of the poet's, having also received a</a>
<a id='line_284'>part of the forfeited Desmond estate, led to the publication of the _Faerie</a>
<a id='line_285'>Queene_. Sitting under the shade "of the green alders of the Mulla's</a>
<a id='line_286'>shore," Spenser read to his guest the first books of his poem. So pleased</a>
<a id='line_287'>was Raleigh that he persuaded the poet to accompany him to London, and</a>
<a id='line_288'>there lay his poem at the feet of the great queen, whose praises he had so</a>
<a id='line_289'>gloriously sung. The trip was made, Spenser was presented to Elizabeth, and</a>
<a id='line_290'>read to her Majesty the three Legends of Holiness, Temperance, and</a>
<a id='line_291'>Chastity. She was delighted with the fragmentary epic in which she heard</a>
<a id='line_292'>herself delicately complimented in turn as Gloriana, Belphoebe, and</a>
<a id='line_293'>Britomart, conferred upon the poet a pension of _L_50 yearly, and permitted</a>
<a id='line_294'>the _Faerie Queene_ to be published with a dedication to herself. Launched</a>
<a id='line_295'>under such auspices, it is no wonder that the poem was received by the</a>
<a id='line_296'>court and all England with unprecedented applause.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>The next year while still in London, Spenser collected his early poems and</a>
<a id='line_299'>issued them under the title of _Complaints_. In this volume were the _Ruins</a>
<a id='line_300'>of Time_ and the _Tears of the Muses_, two poems on the indifference shown</a>
<a id='line_301'>to literature before 1580, and the remarkable _Mother Hubberds Tale_, a</a>
<a id='line_302'>bitter satire on the army, the court, the church, and politics. His</a>
<a id='line_303'>_Daphnaida_ was also published about the same time. On his return to</a>
<a id='line_304'>Ireland he gave a charming picture of life at Kilcolman Castle, with an</a>
<a id='line_305'>account of his visit to the court, in _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_. The</a>
<a id='line_306'>story of the long and desperate courtship of his second love, Elizabeth,</a>
<a id='line_307'>whom he wedded in 1594, is told in the _Amoretti_, a sonnet sequence full</a>
<a id='line_308'>of passion and tenderness. His rapturous wedding ode, the _Epithalamion_,</a>
<a id='line_309'>which is, by general consent, the most glorious bridal song in our</a>
<a id='line_310'>language, and the most perfect of all his poems in its freshness, purity,</a>
<a id='line_311'>and passion, was also published in 1595. The next year Spenser was back in</a>
<a id='line_312'>London and published the _Prothalamion_, a lovely ode on the marriage of</a>
<a id='line_313'>Lord Worcester's daughters, and his four _Hymns_ on Love and Beauty,</a>
<a id='line_314'>Heavenly Love, and Heavenly Beauty. The first two _Hymns_ are early poems,</a>
<a id='line_315'>and the two latter maturer work embodying Petrarch's philosophy, which</a>
<a id='line_316'>teaches that earthly love is a ladder that leads men to the love of God. In</a>
<a id='line_317'>this year, 1596, also appeared the last three books of the _Faerie Queene_,</a>
<a id='line_318'>containing the Legends of Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>At the height of his fame, happiness, and prosperity, Spenser returned for</a>
<a id='line_321'>the last time to Ireland in 1597, and was recommended by the queen for the</a>
<a id='line_322'>office of Sheriff of Cork. Surrounded by his beloved wife and children, his</a>
<a id='line_323'>domestic life was serene and happy, but in gloomy contrast his public life</a>
<a id='line_324'>was stormy and full of anxiety and danger. He was the acknowledged prince</a>
<a id='line_325'>of living poets, and was planning the completion of his mighty epic of the</a>
<a id='line_326'>private virtues in twelve books, to be followed by twelve more on the civic</a>
<a id='line_327'>virtues. The native Irish had steadily withstood his claim to the estate,</a>
<a id='line_328'>and continually harassed him with lawsuits. They detested their foreign</a>
<a id='line_329'>oppressors and awaited a favorable opportunity to rise. Discord and riot</a>
<a id='line_330'>increased on all sides. The ever growing murmurs of discontent gave place</a>
<a id='line_331'>to cries for vengeance and unrepressed acts of hostility. Finally, in the</a>
<a id='line_332'>fall of 1598, there occurred a fearful uprising known as Tyrone's</a>
<a id='line_333'>Rebellion, in which the outraged peasants fiercely attacked the castle,</a>
<a id='line_334'>plundering and burning. Spenser and his family barely escaped with their</a>
<a id='line_335'>lives. According to one old tradition, an infant child was left behind in</a>
<a id='line_336'>the hurried flight and perished in the flames; but this has been shown to</a>
<a id='line_337'>be but one of the wild rumors repeated to exaggerate the horror of the</a>
<a id='line_338'>uprising. Long after Spenser's death, it was also rumored that the last six</a>
<a id='line_339'>books of the _Faerie Queene_ had been lost in the flight; but the story is</a>
<a id='line_340'>now utterly discredited.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>Spenser once more arrived in London, but he was now in dire distress and</a>
<a id='line_343'>prostrated by the hardships which he had suffered. There on January 16,</a>
<a id='line_344'>1599, at a tavern in King Street, Westminster, the great poet died</a>
<a id='line_345'>broken-hearted and in poverty. Drummond of Hawthornden states that Ben</a>
<a id='line_346'>Jonson told him that Spenser "died for lack of bread in King Street, and</a>
<a id='line_347'>refused 20 pieces sent to him by my Lord of Essex, and said He was sorrie</a>
<a id='line_348'>he had no time to spend them." The story is probably a bit of exaggerated</a>
<a id='line_349'>gossip. He was buried close to the tomb of Chaucer in the Poets' Corner in</a>
<a id='line_350'>Westminster Abbey, his fellow-poets bearing the pall, and the Earl of Essex</a>
<a id='line_351'>defraying the expenses of the funeral. Referring to the death of Spenser's</a>
<a id='line_352'>great contemporary, Basse wrote:--</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>  "Renowned Spenser, lie a thought more nigh</a>
<a id='line_355'>  To learned Chaucer, and rare Beaumont, lie</a>
<a id='line_356'>  A little nearer Spenser, to make room</a>
<a id='line_357'>  For Shakespeare in your threefold, fourfold tomb."</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>"Thus," says Mr. Stopford Brooke, appropriately, "London, 'his most kindly</a>
<a id='line_360'>nurse,' takes care also of his dust, and England keeps him in her love."</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>Spenser's influence on English poetry can hardly be overestimated. Keats</a>
<a id='line_363'>called him "the poets' poet," a title which has been universally approved.</a>
<a id='line_364'>"He is the poet of all others," says Mr. Saintsbury, "for those who seek in</a>
<a id='line_365'>poetry only poetical qualities." His work has appealed most strongly to</a>
<a id='line_366'>those who have been poets themselves, for with him the poetical attraction</a>
<a id='line_367'>is supreme. Many of the greatest poets have delighted to call him master,</a>
<a id='line_368'>and have shown him the same loving reverence which he gave to Chaucer.</a>
<a id='line_369'>Minor poets like Sidney, Drayton, and Daniel paid tribute to his</a>
<a id='line_370'>inspiration; Milton was deeply indebted to him, especially in _Lycidas_;</a>
<a id='line_371'>and many of the pensive poets of the seventeenth century show traces of his</a>
<a id='line_372'>influence. "Spenser delighted Shakespeare," says Mr. Church; "he was the</a>
<a id='line_373'>poetical master of Cowley, and then of Milton, and in a sense of Dryden,</a>
<a id='line_374'>and even Pope." Giles and Phineas Fletcher, William Browne, Sir William</a>
<a id='line_375'>Alexander, Shenstone, Collins, Cowley, Gray, and James Thomson were all</a>
<a id='line_376'>direct followers of Spenser. His influence upon the poets of the romantic</a>
<a id='line_377'>revival of the nineteenth century is even more marked. "Spenser begot</a>
<a id='line_378'>Keats," says Mr. Saintsbury, "and Keats begot Tennyson, and Tennyson begot</a>
<a id='line_379'>all the rest." Among this notable company of disciples should be mentioned</a>
<a id='line_380'>especially Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne. If we include within the sphere</a>
<a id='line_381'>of Spenser's influence also those who have made use of the stanza which he</a>
<a id='line_382'>invented, we must add the names of Burns, Shelley, Byron, Beattie,</a>
<a id='line_383'>Campbell, Scott, and Wordsworth. When we consider the large number of poets</a>
<a id='line_384'>in whom Spenser awakened the poetic gift, or those to whose powers he gave</a>
<a id='line_385'>direction, we may safely pronounce him the most seminal poet in the</a>
<a id='line_386'>language.</a>
<a id='line_387'></a>
<a id='line_388'>III. STUDY OF THE _FAERIE QUEENE_</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>
<a id='line_390'>1. A ROMANTIC EPIC.--The _Faerie Queene_ is the most perfect type which we</a>
<a id='line_391'>have in English of the purely _romantic poem_. Four elements enter into its</a>
<a id='line_392'>composition: "it is pastoral by association, chivalrous by temper, ethical</a>
<a id='line_393'>by tendency, and allegorical by treatment" (Renton). Its subject was taken</a>
<a id='line_394'>from the old cycle of Arthurian legends, which were brightened with the</a>
<a id='line_395'>terrorless magic of Ariosto and Tasso. The scene of the adventures is laid</a>
<a id='line_396'>in the enchanted forests and castles of the far away and unreal fairyland</a>
<a id='line_397'>of mediaeval chivalry, and the incidents themselves are either highly</a>
<a id='line_398'>improbable or frankly impossible. The language is frequently archaic and</a>
<a id='line_399'>designedly unfamiliar. Much of the machinery and properties used in</a>
<a id='line_400'>carrying on the story, such as speaking myrtles, magic mirrors, swords,</a>
<a id='line_401'>rings, impenetrable armor, and healing fountains, is supernatural. All the</a>
<a id='line_402'>characters--the knights, ladies, dwarfs, magicians, dragons, nymphs,</a>
<a id='line_403'>satyrs, and giants--are the conventional figures of pastoral romance.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>The framework of the plot of the _Faerie Queene_ is vast and loosely put</a>
<a id='line_406'>together. There are six main stories, or legends, and each contains several</a>
<a id='line_407'>digressions and involved episodes. The plan of the entire work, which the</a>
<a id='line_408'>author only half completed, is outlined in his letter to Sir Walter</a>
<a id='line_409'>Raleigh. This letter serves as an admirable introduction to the poem, and</a>
<a id='line_410'>should be read attentively by the student. Gloriana, the Queen of</a>
<a id='line_411'>Fairyland, holds at her court a solemn feudal festival, lasting twelve</a>
<a id='line_412'>days, during which she sends forth twelve of her greatest knights on as</a>
<a id='line_413'>many separate adventures. The knights are commissioned to champion the</a>
<a id='line_414'>cause of persons in distress and redress their wrongs. The ideal knight,</a>
<a id='line_415'>Prince Arthur, is the central male figure of the poem. He is enamoured of</a>
<a id='line_416'>Gloriana, having seen her in a wondrous vision, and is represented as</a>
<a id='line_417'>journeying in quest of her. He appears in all of the legends at opportune</a>
<a id='line_418'>moments to succor the knights when they are hard beset or in the power of</a>
<a id='line_419'>their enemies. The six extant books contain respectively the legends of (I)</a>
<a id='line_420'>the Knight of the Redcrosse, or Holiness, (II) Sir Guyon, the Knight of</a>
<a id='line_421'>Temperance, (III) Britomart, the female Knight of Chastity, (IV) Sir</a>
<a id='line_422'>Campbell and Sir Triamond, the Knights of Friendship, (V) Sir Artegall, the</a>
<a id='line_423'>Knight of Justice, and (VI) Sir Caledore, the Knight of Courtesy. Book I is</a>
<a id='line_424'>an allegory of man's relation to God, Book II, of man's relation to</a>
<a id='line_425'>himself, Books III, IV, V, and VI, of man's relation to his fellow-man.</a>
<a id='line_426'>Prince Arthur, the personification of Magnificence, by which Spenser means</a>
<a id='line_427'>Magnanimity (Aristotle's [Greek: megalopsychia]), is the ideal of a perfect</a>
<a id='line_428'>character, in which all the private virtues are united. It is a poem of</a>
<a id='line_429'>culture, inculcating the moral ideals of Aristotle and the teachings of</a>
<a id='line_430'>Christianity.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>2. INFLUENCE OF THE NEW LEARNING.--Like Milton, Gray, and other English</a>
<a id='line_433'>poets, Spenser was a scholar familiar with the best in ancient and modern</a>
<a id='line_434'>literature. As to Spenser's specific indebtedness, though he owed much in</a>
<a id='line_435'>incident and diction to Chaucer's version of the _Romance of the Rose_ and</a>
<a id='line_436'>to Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, the great epic poets, Tasso and Ariosto,</a>
<a id='line_437'>should be given first place. The resemblance of passages in the _Faerie</a>
<a id='line_438'>Queene_ to others in the _Orlando Furioso_ and the _Jerusalem Delivered_ is</a>
<a id='line_439'>so striking that some have accused the English poet of paraphrasing and</a>
<a id='line_440'>slavishly borrowing from the two Italians. Many of these parallels are</a>
<a id='line_441'>pointed out in the notes. To this criticism, Mr. Saintsbury remarks: "Not,</a>
<a id='line_442'>perhaps, till the _Orlando_ has been carefully read, and read in the</a>
<a id='line_443'>original, is Spenser's real greatness understood. He has often, and</a>
<a id='line_444'>evidently of purpose, challenged comparison; but in every instance it will</a>
<a id='line_445'>be found that his beauties are emphatically his own. He has followed</a>
<a id='line_446'>Ariosto only as Vergil has followed Homer, and much less slavishly."</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>The influence of the New Learning is clearly evident in Spenser's use of</a>
<a id='line_449'>_classical mythology_. Greek myths are placed side by side with Christian</a>
<a id='line_450'>imagery and legends. Like Dante, the poet did not consider the Hellenic</a>
<a id='line_451'>doctrine of sensuous beauty to be antagonistic to the truths of religion.</a>
<a id='line_452'>There is sometimes an incongruous confusion of classicism and mediaevalism,</a>
<a id='line_453'>as when a magician is seen in the house of Morpheus, and a sorcerer goes to</a>
<a id='line_454'>the realm of Pluto. Spenser was guided by a higher and truer sense of</a>
<a id='line_455'>beauty than the classical purists know.</a>
<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>A very attractive element of his classicism is his _worship of beauty_. The</a>
<a id='line_458'>Greek conception of beauty included two forms--the sensuous and the</a>
<a id='line_459'>spiritual. So richly colored and voluptuous are his descriptions that he</a>
<a id='line_460'>has been called the painters' poet, "the Rubens," and "the Raphael of the</a>
<a id='line_461'>poets." As with Plato, Spenser's idea of the spiritually beautiful includes</a>
<a id='line_462'>the true and the good. Sensuous beauty is seen in the forms of external</a>
<a id='line_463'>nature, like the morning mist and sunshine, the rose gardens, the green</a>
<a id='line_464'>elders, and the quiet streams. His ideal of perfect sensuous and spiritual</a>
<a id='line_465'>beauty combined is found in womanhood. Such a one is Una, the dream of the</a>
<a id='line_466'>poet's young manhood, and we recognize in her one whose soul is as fair as</a>
<a id='line_467'>her face--an idealized type of a woman in real life who calls forth all our</a>
<a id='line_468'>love and reverence.</a>
<a id='line_469'></a>
<a id='line_470'>3. INTERPRETATION OF THE ALLEGORY.--In the sixteenth century it was the</a>
<a id='line_471'>opinion of Puritan England that every literary masterpiece should not only</a>
<a id='line_472'>give entertainment, but should also teach some moral or spiritual lesson.</a>
<a id='line_473'>"No one," says Mr. Patee, "after reading Spenser's letter to Raleigh, can</a>
<a id='line_474'>wander far into Spenser's poem without the conviction that the author's</a>
<a id='line_475'>central purpose was didactic, almost as much as was Bunyan's in _Pilgrim's</a>
<a id='line_476'>Progress._" Milton doubtless had this feature of the _Faerie Queene_ in</a>
<a id='line_477'>mind when he wrote in _Il Penseroso_:--</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>  "And if aught else great bards beside</a>
<a id='line_480'>  In sage and solemn tunes have sung</a>
<a id='line_481'>  Of turneys, and of trophies hung,</a>
<a id='line_482'>  Of forests and enchantments drear,</a>
<a id='line_483'>  _Where more is meant than meets the ear_."</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>That the allegory of the poem is closely connected with its aim and ethical</a>
<a id='line_486'>tendency is evident from the statement of the author that "the generall end</a>
<a id='line_487'>therefore of all the booke is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in</a>
<a id='line_488'>vertuous and gentle discipline. Which for that I conceived should be most</a>
<a id='line_489'>plausible and pleasing, being coloured with an historical fiction, the</a>
<a id='line_490'>which the most part of men delight to read, rather for varietie of matter</a>
<a id='line_491'>then for profite of the ensample." The _Faerie Queene_ is, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_492'>according to the avowed purpose of its author, a poem of culture. Though it</a>
<a id='line_493'>is one of the most highly artistic works in the language, it is at the same</a>
<a id='line_494'>time one of the most didactic. "It professes," says Mr. Church, "to be a</a>
<a id='line_495'>veiled exposition of moral philosophy."</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>The allegory is threefold,--moral, religious, and personal.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'>(a) _Moral Allegory._--The characters all represent various virtues and</a>
<a id='line_500'>vices, whose intrigues and warfare against each other symbolize the</a>
<a id='line_501'>struggle of the human soul after perfection. The Redcross Knight, for</a>
<a id='line_502'>example, personifies the single private virtue of holiness, while Prince</a>
<a id='line_503'>Arthur stands for that perfect manhood which combines all the moral</a>
<a id='line_504'>qualities; Una represents abstract truth, while Gloriana symbolizes the</a>
<a id='line_505'>union of all the virtues in perfect womanhood.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>(b) _Religious or Spiritual Allegory._--Under this interpretation the</a>
<a id='line_508'>Redcross Knight is a personification of Protestant England, or the church</a>
<a id='line_509'>militant, while Una represents the true religion of the Reformed Church. On</a>
<a id='line_510'>the other hand, Archimago symbolizes the deceptions of the Jesuits and</a>
<a id='line_511'>Duessa the false Church of Rome masquerading as true religion.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>(c) _Personal and Political Allegory._--Here we find a concrete</a>
<a id='line_514'>presentation of many of Spenser's chief contemporaries. One of Spenser's</a>
<a id='line_515'>prime objects in composing his epic was to please certain powerful persons</a>
<a id='line_516'>at court, and above all to win praise and patronage from the vain and</a>
<a id='line_517'>flattery loving queen, whom he celebrates as Gloriana. Prince Arthur is a</a>
<a id='line_518'>character that similarly pays homage to Lord Leicester. In the Redcross</a>
<a id='line_519'>Knight he compliments, no doubt, some gentleman like Sir Philip Sidney or</a>
<a id='line_520'>Sir Walter Raleigh, as if he were a second St. George, the patron saint of</a>
<a id='line_521'>England, while in Una we may see idealized some fair lady of the court. In</a>
<a id='line_522'>Archimago he satirizes the odious King Philip II of Spain, and in false</a>
<a id='line_523'>Duessa the fascinating intriguer, Mary Queen of Scots, who was undeserving</a>
<a id='line_524'>so hard a blow.</a>

<a id='line_583'>4. THE SPENSERIAN STANZA.--The _Faerie Queene_ is written in the Spenserian</a>
<a id='line_584'>Stanza, a form which the poet himself invented as a suitable vehicle for a</a>
<a id='line_585'>long narrative poem. Suggestions for its construction were taken from three</a>
<a id='line_586'>Italian metres--the Ottava Rima, the Terza Rima, the Sonnet--and the</a>
<a id='line_587'>Ballade stanza. There are eight lines in the iambic pentameter measure</a>
<a id='line_588'>(five accents); e.g.--</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>v -/- |  v   -/-   |  v   -/-  |  v -/- |  v   -/-</a>
<a id='line_591'>a gen | tle knight | was prick | ing on | the plaine</a>
<a id='line_592'>followed by one iambic hexameter, or Alexandrine (six accents); e.g.--</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>v  -/- |  v   -/-   |  v   -/-  |  v   -/-   | v  -/-  | v   -/-</a>
<a id='line_595'>as one | for knight | ly giusts | and fierce | encount | ers fitt</a>
<a id='line_596'>The rhymes are arranged in the following order: _ab ab bc bcc_. It will be</a>
<a id='line_597'>observed that the two quatrains are bound together by the first two b</a>
<a id='line_598'>rhymes, and the Alexandrine, which rhymes with the eighth line, draws out</a>
<a id='line_599'>the harmony with a peculiar lingering effect. In scanning and reading it is</a>
<a id='line_600'>necessary to observe the laws of accentuation and pronunciation prevailing</a>
<a id='line_601'>in Spenser's day; e.g. in _learned_ (I, i), _undeserved_ (I, ii), and</a>
<a id='line_602'>_woundes_ (V, xvii) the final syllable is sounded, _patience_ (X, xxix) is</a>
<a id='line_603'>trisyllabic, _devotion_ (X, xl) is four syllables, and _entertainment_ (X,</a>
<a id='line_604'>xxxvii) is accented on the second and fourth syllables. Frequently there is</a>
<a id='line_605'>in the line a caesural pause, which may occur anywhere; e.g.--</a>
<a id='line_606'></a>
<a id='line_607'>  "And quite dismembred hath; | the thirsty land</a>
<a id='line_608'>  Dronke up his life; | his corse left on the strand." (III, xx.)</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>The rhythm of the meter is also varied by the alternating of end-stopped</a>
<a id='line_611'>and run-on lines, as in the last quotation. An end-stopped line has a pause</a>
<a id='line_612'>at the end, usually indicated by some mark of punctuation. A run-on line</a>
<a id='line_613'>should be read closely with the following line with only a slight pause to</a>
<a id='line_614'>indicate the line-unit. Monotony is prevented by the occasional use of a</a>
<a id='line_615'>light or feminine ending--a syllable on which the voice does not or cannot</a>
<a id='line_616'>rest; e.g.--</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>  "Then choosing out few words most horrible." (I, xxxvii.)</a>
<a id='line_619'>  "That for his love refused deity." (III, xxi.)</a>
<a id='line_620'>  "His ship far come from watrie wilderness." (III, xxxii.)</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>The use of alliteration, i.e. having several words in a line beginning with</a>
<a id='line_623'>the same letter, is another device frequently employed by Spenser for</a>
<a id='line_624'>musical effect; e.g.--</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>  "In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare." (I, xxxvi.)</a>
<a id='line_627'>  "Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleep them biddes." (I, xxxvi.)</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>5. VERSIFICATION.--In the handling of his stanza, Spenser revealed a</a>
<a id='line_630'>harmony, sweetness, and color never before dreamed of in the English. Its</a>
<a id='line_631'>compass, which admitted of an almost endless variety of cadence, harmonized</a>
<a id='line_632'>well with the necessity for continuous narration. It appeals to the eye as</a>
<a id='line_633'>well as to the ear, with its now languid, now vigorous, but always graceful</a>
<a id='line_634'>turn of phrase. Its movement has been compared to the smooth, steady,</a>
<a id='line_635'>irresistible sweep of water in a mighty river. Like Lyly, Marlowe, and</a>
<a id='line_636'>Shakespeare, Spenser felt the new delight in the pictorial and musical</a>
<a id='line_637'>qualities of words, and invented new melodies and word pictures. He aimed</a>
<a id='line_638'>rather at finish, exactness, and fastidious neatness than at ease, freedom,</a>
<a id='line_639'>and irregularity; and if his versification has any fault, it is that of</a>
<a id='line_640'>monotony. The atmosphere is always perfectly adapted to the theme.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>6. DICTION AND STYLE.--The peculiar diction of the _Faerie Queene_ should</a>
<a id='line_643'>receive the careful attention of the student. As a romantic poet, Spenser</a>
<a id='line_644'>often preferred archaic and semi-obsolete language to more modern forms. He</a>
<a id='line_645'>uses four classes of words that were recognized as the proper and</a>
<a id='line_646'>conventional language of pastoral and romantic poetry; viz. (a)</a>
<a id='line_647'>_archaisms_, (b) _dialect_, (c) _classicisms_, and (d) _gallicisms_. He did</a>
<a id='line_648'>not hesitate to adopt from Chaucer many obsolete words and grammatical</a>
<a id='line_649'>forms. Examples are: the double negative with _ne_; _eyen_, _lenger_,</a>
<a id='line_650'>_doen_, _ycladd_, _harrowd_, _purchas_, _raught_, _seely_, _stowre_,</a>
<a id='line_651'>_swinge_, _owch_, and _withouten_. He also employs many old words from</a>
<a id='line_652'>Layamon, Wiclif, and Langland, like _swelt_, _younglings_, _noye_, _kest_,</a>
<a id='line_653'>_hurtle_, and _loft_. His dialectic forms are taken from the vernacular of</a>
<a id='line_654'>the North Lancashire folk with which he was familiar. Some are still a part</a>
<a id='line_655'>of the spoken language of that region, such as, _brent_, _cruddled_,</a>
<a id='line_656'>_forswat_, _fearen_, _forray_, _pight_, _sithen_, _carle_, and _carke_.</a>
<a id='line_657'></a>
<a id='line_658'>Examples of his use of classical constructions are: the ablative absolute,</a>
<a id='line_659'>as, _which doen_ (IV, xliii); the relative construction with _when_, as,</a>
<a id='line_660'>_which when_ (I, xvii), _that when_ (VII, xi); the comparative of the</a>
<a id='line_661'>adjective in the sense of "too," as, _weaker_ (I, xlv), harder (II, xxxvi);</a>
<a id='line_662'>the participial construction after _till_, as, _till further tryall made_</a>
<a id='line_663'>(I, xii); the superlative of location, as, _middest_ (IV, xv); and the old</a>
<a id='line_664'>gerundive, as, _wandering wood_ (I, xiii). Most of the gallicisms found are</a>
<a id='line_665'>anglicized loan words from the French _romans d'aventure_, such as,</a>
<a id='line_666'>_disseized_, _cheare_, _chappell_, _assoiled_, _guerdon_, _palfrey_,</a>
<a id='line_667'>_recreaunt_, _trenchand_, _syre_, and _trusse_. Notwithstanding Spenser's</a>
<a id='line_668'>use of foreign words and constructions, his language is as thoroughly</a>
<a id='line_669'>English in its idiom as that of any of our great poets.</a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>"I think that if he had not been a great poet," says Leigh Hunt, "he would</a>
<a id='line_672'>have been a great painter."</a>
<a id='line_673'></a>
<a id='line_674'>"After reading," says Pope, "a canto of Spenser two or three days ago to an</a>
<a id='line_675'>old lady, between seventy and eighty years of age, she said that I had been</a>
<a id='line_676'>showing her a gallery of pictures. I do not know how it is, but she said</a>
<a id='line_677'>very right. There is something in Spenser that pleases one as strongly in</a>
<a id='line_678'>old age as it did in youth. I read the _Faerie Queene_ when I was about</a>
<a id='line_679'>twelve, with infinite delight; and I think it gave me as much, when I read</a>
<a id='line_680'>it over about a year or two ago."</a>
<a id='line_681'></a>
<a id='line_682'>The imperishable charm of the poem lies in its appeal to the pure sense of</a>
<a id='line_683'>beauty. "A beautiful pagan dream," says Taine, "carries on a beautiful</a>
<a id='line_684'>dream of chivalry." The reader hears in its lines a stately and undulating</a>
<a id='line_685'>rhythm that intoxicates the ear and carries him on with an irresistible</a>
<a id='line_686'>fascination, he sees the unsubstantial forms of fairyland go sweeping by in</a>
<a id='line_687'>a gorgeous and dreamlike pageantry, and he feels pulsing in its luxuriant</a>
<a id='line_688'>and enchanted atmosphere the warm and beauty-loving temper of the Italian</a>
<a id='line_689'>Renaissance. "Spenser is superior to his subject," says Taine, "comprehends</a>
<a id='line_690'>it fully, frames it with a view to the end, in order to impress upon it the</a>
<a id='line_691'>proper mark of his soul and his genius. Each story is modified with respect</a>
<a id='line_692'>to another, and all with respect to a certain effect which is being worked</a>
<a id='line_693'>out. Thus a beauty issues from this harmony,--the beauty in the poet's</a>
<a id='line_694'>heart,--which his whole work strives to express; a noble and yet a laughing</a>
<a id='line_695'>beauty, made up of moral elevation and sensuous seductions, English in</a>
<a id='line_696'>sentiment, Italian in externals, chivalric in subject, modern in its</a>
<a id='line_697'>perfection, representing a unique and admirable epoch, the appearance of</a>
<a id='line_698'>paganism in a Christian race, and the worship of form by an imagination of</a>
<a id='line_699'>the North."</a>

<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>SIR,</a>
<a id='line_776'></a>
<a id='line_777'>Knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be constructed, and this booke of</a>
<a id='line_778'>mine, which I have entituled _The Faery Queene_, being a continued</a>
<a id='line_779'>Allegorie, or darke conceit, I have thought good, as well for avoyding of</a>
<a id='line_780'>jealous opinions and misconstructions, as also for your better light in</a>
<a id='line_781'>reading thereof, (being so, by you commanded) to discover unto you the</a>
<a id='line_782'>generall intention and meaning, which in the whole course thereof I have</a>
<a id='line_783'>fashioned, without expressing of any particular purposes, or by-accidents</a>
<a id='line_784'>therein occasioned. The generall end therefore of all the booke, is to</a>
<a id='line_785'>fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline.</a>
<a id='line_786'>Which for that I conceived shoulde be most plausible and pleasing, beeing</a>
<a id='line_787'>coloured with an historicall fiction, the which the most part of men</a>
<a id='line_788'>delight to read, rather for varietie of matter than for profit of the</a>
<a id='line_789'>ensample: I chose the historie of king Arthure, as most fit for the</a>
<a id='line_790'>excellencie of his person, beeing made famous by many mens former workes,</a>
<a id='line_791'>and also furthest from the danger of envie, and suspicion of present time.</a>
<a id='line_792'>In which I have followed all the antique poets historicall: first Homer,</a>
<a id='line_793'>who in the persons of Agamemnon and Ulysses hath ensampled a good governour</a>
<a id='line_794'>and a vertuous man, the one in his _Ilias_, the other in his _Odysseis_:</a>
<a id='line_795'>then Virgil, whose like intention was to doe in the person of _Aeneas_:</a>
<a id='line_796'>after him Ariosto comprised them both in his _Orlando_: and lately Tasso</a>
<a id='line_797'>dissevered them againe, and formed both parts in two persons, namely, that</a>
<a id='line_798'>part which they in philosophy call _Ethice_, or vertues of a private man,</a>
<a id='line_799'>coloured in his _Rinaldo_: the other named _Politice_, in his _Godfredo_.</a>
<a id='line_800'>By ensample of which excellent Poets, I laboure to pourtraict in Arthure,</a>
<a id='line_801'>before he was king, the image of a brave knight, perfected in the twelve</a>
<a id='line_802'>private morall vertues, as Aristotle hath devised: which if I find to be</a>
<a id='line_803'>well accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged to frame the other part of</a>
<a id='line_804'>pollitike vertues in his person, after he came to bee king.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>To some I know this Methode will seem displeasant, which had rather have</a>
<a id='line_807'>good discipline delivered plainly in way of precepts, or sermoned at large,</a>
<a id='line_808'>as they use, then thus clowdily enwrapped in Allegoricall devises. But</a>
<a id='line_809'>such, mee seeme, should be satisfied with the use of these dayes, seeing</a>
<a id='line_810'>all things accounted by their showes, and nothing esteemed of, that is not</a>
<a id='line_811'>delightfull and pleasing to common sense. For this cause is Xenophon</a>
<a id='line_812'>preferred before Plato, for that the one, in the exquisite depth of his</a>
<a id='line_813'>judgement, formed a Commune-wealth, such as it should be; but the other, in</a>
<a id='line_814'>the person of Cyrus and the Persians, fashioned a government, such as might</a>
<a id='line_815'>best be: So much more profitable and gracious is doctrine by ensample then</a>
<a id='line_816'>by rule. So have I laboured to do in the person of Arthure: whom I</a>
<a id='line_817'>conceive, after his long education by Timon (to whom he was by Merlin</a>
<a id='line_818'>delivered to be brought up, so soone as he was borne of the Lady Igrayne)</a>
<a id='line_819'>to have seen in a dreame or vision the Faerie Queene, with whose excellent</a>
<a id='line_820'>beautie ravished, hee awaking, resolved to seek her out: and so, being by</a>
<a id='line_821'>Merlin armed, and by Timon throughly instructed, he went to seeke her forth</a>
<a id='line_822'>in Faery land. In that Faery Queene I mean _Glory_ in my generall</a>
<a id='line_823'>intention: but in my particular I conceive the most excellent and glorious</a>
<a id='line_824'>person of our soveraine the Queene, and her kingdome in Faery land. And</a>
<a id='line_825'>yet, in some places else, I doe otherwise shadow her. For considering shee</a>
<a id='line_826'>beareth two persons, the one of a most royall Queene or Empresse, the other</a>
<a id='line_827'>of a most vertuous and beautifull lady, this latter part in some places I</a>
<a id='line_828'>doe expresse in Belphoebe, fashioning her name according to your owne</a>
<a id='line_829'>excellent conceipt of Cynthia,[2] (Phoebe and Cynthia being both names of</a>
<a id='line_830'>Diana). So in the person of Prince Arthure I sette forth magnificence in</a>
<a id='line_831'>particular, which vertue, for that (according to Aristotle and the rest) it</a>
<a id='line_832'>is the perfection of all the rest, and containeth in it them all, therefore</a>
<a id='line_833'>in the whole course I mention the deeds of Arthure appliable to the vertue,</a>
<a id='line_834'>which I write of in that booke. But of the twelve other vertues I make XII</a>
<a id='line_835'>other knights the patrons, for the more varietie of the historic: Of which</a>
<a id='line_836'>these three bookes containe three. The first, of the Knight of the Red</a>
<a id='line_837'>crosse, in whom I expresse Holinesse: the second of Sir Guyon, in whome I</a>
<a id='line_838'>set foorth Temperance: the third of Britomartis, a Lady knight, in whom I</a>
<a id='line_839'>picture Chastitie. But because the beginning of the whole worke seemeth</a>
<a id='line_840'>abrupt and as depending upon other antecedents, it needs that yee know the</a>
<a id='line_841'>occasion of these three knights severall adventures. For the Methode of a</a>
<a id='line_842'>Poet historicall is not such as of an Historiographer. For an</a>
<a id='line_843'>Historiographer discourseth of affaires orderly as they were done,</a>
<a id='line_844'>accounting as well the times as the actions; but a Poet thrusteth into the</a>
<a id='line_845'>middest, even where it most concerneth him, and there recoursing to the</a>
<a id='line_846'>things forepast, and divining of things to come, maketh a pleasing analysis</a>
<a id='line_847'>of all. The beginning therefore of my historie, if it were to be told by an</a>
<a id='line_848'>Historiographer, should be the twelfth booke, which is the last; where I</a>
<a id='line_849'>devise that the Faery Queene kept her annuall feast twelve daies; uppon</a>
<a id='line_850'>which twelve severall dayes, the occasions of the twelve severall</a>
<a id='line_851'>adventures hapned, which being undertaken by XII severall knights, are in</a>
<a id='line_852'>these twelve books severally handled and discoursed.</a>
<a id='line_853'></a>
<a id='line_854'>The first was this. In the beginning of the feast, there presented him</a>
<a id='line_855'>selfe a tall clownish younge man, who falling before the Queene of Faeries</a>
<a id='line_856'>desired a boone (as the manner then was) which during that feast she might</a>
<a id='line_857'>not refuse: which was that hee might have the atchievement of any</a>
<a id='line_858'>adventure, which during that feast should happen; that being granted, he</a>
<a id='line_859'>rested him selfe on the fioore, unfit through his rusticitie for a better</a>
<a id='line_860'>place. Soone after entred a faire Ladie in mourning weedes, riding on a</a>
<a id='line_861'>white Asse, with a dwarfe behind her leading a warlike steed, that bore the</a>
<a id='line_862'>Armes of a knight, and his speare in the dwarfes hand. She falling before</a>
<a id='line_863'>the Queene of Faeries, complayned that her father and mother, an ancient</a>
<a id='line_864'>King and Queene, had bene by an huge dragon many yeers shut up in a brazen</a>
<a id='line_865'>Castle, who thence suffered them not to issew: and therefore besought the</a>
<a id='line_866'>Faery Queene to assigne her some one of her knights to take on him that</a>
<a id='line_867'>exployt. Presently that clownish person upstarting, desired that adventure;</a>
<a id='line_868'>whereat the Queene much wondering, and the Lady much gaine-saying, yet he</a>
<a id='line_869'>earnestly importuned his desire. In the end the Lady told him, that unlesse</a>
<a id='line_870'>that armour which she brought would serve him (that is, the armour of a</a>
<a id='line_871'>Christian man specified by Saint Paul, V. Ephes.) that he could not succeed</a>
<a id='line_872'>in that enterprise: which being forth with put upon him with due furnitures</a>
<a id='line_873'>thereunto, he seemed the goodliest man in al that company, and was well</a>
<a id='line_874'>liked of the Lady. And eftesoones taking on him knighthood, and mounting on</a>
<a id='line_875'>that straunge Courser, he went forth with her on that adventure: where</a>
<a id='line_876'>beginneth the first booke, viz.</a>
<a id='line_877'></a>
<a id='line_878'>  A gentle knight was pricking on the playne, etc.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>The second day there came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody hands,</a>
<a id='line_881'>whose Parents he complained to have bene slaine by an enchauntresse called</a>
<a id='line_882'>Acrasia: and therefore craved of the Faery Queene, to appoint him some</a>
<a id='line_883'>knight to performe that adventure, which being assigned to Sir Guyon, he</a>
<a id='line_884'>presently went foorth with the same Palmer: which is the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_885'>second booke and the whole subject thereof. The third day there came in a</a>
<a id='line_886'>Groome, who complained before the Faery Queene, that a vile Enchaunter,</a>
<a id='line_887'>called Busirane, had in hand a most faire Lady, called Amoretta, whom he</a>
<a id='line_888'>kept in most grevious torment. Whereupon Sir Scudamour, the lover of that</a>
<a id='line_889'>Lady, presently tooke on him that adventure. But beeing unable to performe</a>
<a id='line_890'>it by reason of the hard Enchauntments, after long sorrow, in the end met</a>
<a id='line_891'>with Britomartis, who succoured him, and reskewed his love.</a>
<a id='line_892'></a>
<a id='line_893'>But by occasion hereof, many other adventures are intermedled; but rather</a>
<a id='line_894'>as accidents then intendments. As the love of Britomart, the overthrow of</a>
<a id='line_895'>Marinell, the miserie of Florimell, the vertuousness of Belphoebe; and many</a>
<a id='line_896'>the like.</a>
<a id='line_897'></a>
<a id='line_898'>Thus much, Sir, I have briefly-over-run to direct your understanding to the</a>
<a id='line_899'>wel-head of the History, that from thence gathering the whole intention of</a>
<a id='line_900'>the conceit, ye may as in a handfull gripe all the discourse, which</a>
<a id='line_901'>otherwise may happely seem tedious and confused. So humbly craving the</a>
<a id='line_902'>continuance of your honourable favour towards me, and th' eternall</a>
