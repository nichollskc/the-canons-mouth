<a id='line_2'>The Motives, Progress, And Effects Of The Conversion Of</a>
<a id='line_3'>Constantine.ÑLegal Establishment And Constitution Of The Christian Or</a>
<a id='line_4'>Catholic Church.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>The public establishment of Christianity may be considered as one of</a>
<a id='line_7'>those important and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively</a>
<a id='line_8'>curiosity, and afford the most valuable instruction. The victories and</a>
<a id='line_9'>the civil policy of Constantine no longer influence the state of</a>
<a id='line_10'>Europe; but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the</a>
<a id='line_11'>impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch; and</a>
<a id='line_12'>the ecclesiastical institutions of his reign are still connected, by an</a>
<a id='line_13'>indissoluble chain, with the opinions, the passions, and the interests</a>
<a id='line_14'>of the present generation. In the consideration of a subject which may</a>
<a id='line_15'>be examined with impartiality, but cannot be viewed with indifference,</a>
<a id='line_16'>a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature; that of</a>
<a id='line_17'>ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of</a>
<a id='line_18'>Constantine. The eloquent Lactantius, in the midst of his court, seems</a>
<a id='line_19'>impatient 1 to proclaim to the world the glorious example of the</a>
<a id='line_20'>sovereign of Gaul; who, in the first moments of his reign, acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_21'>and adored the majesty of the true and only God. 2 The learned Eusebius</a>
<a id='line_22'>has ascribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculous sign which was</a>
<a id='line_23'>displayed in the heavens whilst he meditated and prepared the Italian</a>
<a id='line_24'>expedition. 3 The historian Zosimus maliciously asserts, that the</a>
<a id='line_25'>emperor had imbrued his hands in the blood of his eldest son, before he</a>
<a id='line_26'>publicly renounced the gods of Rome and of his ancestors. 4 The</a>
<a id='line_27'>perplexity produced by these discordant authorities is derived from the</a>
<a id='line_28'>behavior of Constantine himself. According to the strictness of</a>
<a id='line_29'>ecclesiastical language, the first of the _Christian_ emperors was</a>
<a id='line_30'>unworthy of that name, till the moment of his death; since it was only</a>
<a id='line_31'>during his last illness that he received, as a catechumen, the</a>
<a id='line_32'>imposition of hands, 5 and was afterwards admitted, by the initiatory</a>
<a id='line_33'>rites of baptism, into the number of the faithful. 6 The Christianity</a>
<a id='line_34'>of Constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified</a>
<a id='line_35'>sense; and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and</a>
<a id='line_36'>almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself</a>
<a id='line_37'>the protector, and at length the proselyte, of the church. It was an</a>
<a id='line_38'>arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education,</a>
<a id='line_39'>to acknowledge the divine power of Christ, and to understand that the</a>
<a id='line_40'>truth of _his_ revelation was incompatible with the worship of the</a>
<a id='line_41'>gods. The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind,</a>
<a id='line_42'>instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a</a>
<a id='line_43'>national religion; and he insensibly discovered his new opinions, as</a>
<a id='line_44'>far as he could enforce them with safety and with effect. During the</a>
<a id='line_45'>whole course of his reign, the stream of Christianity flowed with a</a>
<a id='line_46'>gentle, though accelerated, motion: but its general direction was</a>
<a id='line_47'>sometimes checked, and sometimes diverted, by the accidental</a>
<a id='line_48'>circumstances of the times, and by the prudence, or possibly by the</a>
<a id='line_49'>caprice, of the monarch. His ministers were permitted to signify the</a>
<a id='line_50'>intentions of their master in the various language which was best</a>
<a id='line_51'>adapted to their respective principles; 7 and he artfully balanced the</a>
<a id='line_52'>hopes and fears of his subjects, by publishing in the same year two</a>
<a id='line_53'>edicts; the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday, 8</a>
<a id='line_54'>and the second directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices. 9</a>
<a id='line_55'>While this important revolution yet remained in suspense, the</a>
<a id='line_56'>Christians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with</a>
<a id='line_57'>the same anxiety, but with very opposite sentiments. The former were</a>
<a id='line_58'>prompted by every motive of zeal, as well as vanity, to exaggerate the</a>
<a id='line_59'>marks of his favor, and the evidences of his faith. The latter, till</a>
<a id='line_60'>their just apprehensions were changed into despair and resentment,</a>
<a id='line_61'>attempted to conceal from the world, and from themselves, that the gods</a>
<a id='line_62'>of Rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their</a>
<a id='line_63'>votaries. The same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial</a>
<a id='line_64'>writers of the times to connect the public profession of Christianity</a>
<a id='line_65'>with the most glorious or the most ignominious ¾ra of the reign of</a>
<a id='line_66'>Constantine.</a>

<a id='line_75'>dedicated his Institutions to the sovereign of Gaul, at a time when</a>
<a id='line_76'>Galerius, Maximin, and even Licinius, persecuted the Christians; that</a>
<a id='line_77'>is, between the years 306 and 311.]</a>

<a id='line_80'>important of these passages is indeed wanting in twenty-eight</a>

<a id='line_82'>value of these manuscripts, one of 900 years old, in the king of</a>
<a id='line_83'>FranceÕs library may be alleged in its favor; but the passage is</a>

<a id='line_97'>time (Euseb. in Vit Constant. l. iv. c. 61) immediately before his</a>
<a id='line_98'>baptism and death. From the connection of these two facts, Valesius (ad</a>
<a id='line_99'>loc. Euseb.) has drawn the conclusion which is reluctantly admitted by</a>
<a id='line_100'>Tillemont, (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 628,) and opposed with</a>

<a id='line_124'>character of a commentator, endeavors (tom. vi. p. 257) to excuse</a>
<a id='line_125'>Constantine; but the more zealous Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A. D. 321,</a>
<a id='line_126'>No. 17) censures his profane conduct with truth and asperity.]</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>Whatever symptoms of Christian piety might transpire in the discourses</a>
<a id='line_129'>or actions of Constantine, he persevered till he was near forty years</a>
<a id='line_130'>of age in the practice of the established religion; 10 and the same</a>
<a id='line_131'>conduct which in the court of Nicomedia might be imputed to his fear,</a>
<a id='line_132'>could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of</a>
<a id='line_133'>Gaul. His liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods; the</a>
<a id='line_134'>medals which issued from his Imperial mint are impressed with the</a>
<a id='line_135'>figures and attributes of Jupiter and Apollo, of Mars and Hercules; and</a>
<a id='line_136'>his filial piety increased the council of Olympus by the solemn</a>
<a id='line_137'>apotheosis of his father Constantius. 11 But the devotion of</a>
<a id='line_138'>Constantine was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the Sun, the</a>
<a id='line_139'>Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology; and he was pleased to be</a>
<a id='line_140'>represented with the symbols of the God of Light and Poetry. The</a>
<a id='line_141'>unerring shafts of that deity, the brightness of his eyes, his laurel</a>
<a id='line_142'>wreath, immortal beauty, and elegant accomplishments, seem to point him</a>
<a id='line_143'>out as the patron of a young hero. The altars of Apollo were crowned</a>
<a id='line_144'>with the votive offerings of Constantine; and the credulous multitude</a>
<a id='line_145'>were taught to believe, that the emperor was permitted to behold with</a>
<a id='line_146'>mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity; and that,</a>
<a id='line_147'>either walking or in a vision, he was blessed with the auspicious omens</a>
<a id='line_148'>of a long and victorious reign. The Sun was universally celebrated as</a>
<a id='line_149'>the invincible guide and protector of Constantine; and the Pagans might</a>
<a id='line_150'>reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting</a>
<a id='line_151'>vengeance the impiety of his ungrateful favorite. 12</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>10 (return) [ Theodoret. (l. i. c. 18) seems to insinuate that Helena</a>
<a id='line_154'>gave her son a Christian education; but we may be assured, from the</a>
<a id='line_155'>superior authority of Eusebius, (in Vit. Constant. l. iii. c. 47,) that</a>
<a id='line_156'>she herself was indebted to Constantine for the knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_157'>Christianity.]</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>11 (return) [ See the medals of Constantine in Ducange and Banduri. As</a>
<a id='line_160'>few cities had retained the privilege of coining, almost all the medals</a>
<a id='line_161'>of that age issued from the mint under the sanction of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_162'>authority.]</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>12 (return) [ The panegyric of Eumenius, (vii. inter Panegyr. Vet.,)</a>
<a id='line_165'>which was pronounced a few months before the Italian war, abounds with</a>
<a id='line_166'>the most unexceptionable evidence of the Pagan superstition of</a>
<a id='line_167'>Constantine, and of his particular veneration for Apollo, or the Sun;</a>
<a id='line_168'>to which Julian alludes.]</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>As long as Constantine exercised a limited sovereignty over the</a>
<a id='line_171'>provinces of Gaul, his Christian subjects were protected by the</a>
<a id='line_172'>authority, and perhaps by the laws, of a prince, who wisely left to the</a>
<a id='line_173'>gods the care of vindicating their own honor. If we may credit the</a>
<a id='line_174'>assertion of Constantine himself, he had been an indignant spectator of</a>
<a id='line_175'>the savage cruelties which were inflicted, by the hands of Roman</a>
<a id='line_176'>soldiers, on those citizens whose religion was their only crime. 13 In</a>
<a id='line_177'>the East and in the West, he had seen the different effects of severity</a>
<a id='line_178'>and indulgence; and as the former was rendered still more odious by the</a>
<a id='line_179'>example of Galerius, his implacable enemy, the latter was recommended</a>
<a id='line_180'>to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father. The son</a>
<a id='line_181'>of Constantius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of</a>
<a id='line_182'>persecution, and granted the free exercise of their religious</a>
<a id='line_183'>ceremonies to all those who had already professed themselves members of</a>
<a id='line_184'>the church. They were soon encouraged to depend on the favor as well as</a>
<a id='line_185'>on the justice of their sovereign, who had imbibed a secret and sincere</a>
<a id='line_186'>reverence for the name of Christ, and for the God of the Christians. 14</a>

<a id='line_189'>be shown, that the Greek translator has improved the sense of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_190'>original; and the aged emperor might recollect the persecution of</a>
<a id='line_191'>Diocletian with a more lively abhorrence than he had actually felt to</a>
<a id='line_192'>the days of his youth and Paganism.]</a>

<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>About five months after the conquest of Italy, the emperor made a</a>
<a id='line_199'>solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated</a>
<a id='line_200'>edict of Milan, which restored peace to the Catholic church. In the</a>
<a id='line_201'>personal interview of the two western princes, Constantine, by the</a>
<a id='line_202'>ascendant of genius and power, obtained the ready concurrence of his</a>
<a id='line_203'>colleague, Licinius; the union of their names and authority disarmed</a>
<a id='line_204'>the fury of Maximin; and after the death of the tyrant of the East, the</a>
<a id='line_205'>edict of Milan was received as a general and fundamental law of the</a>
<a id='line_206'>Roman world. 15</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>15 (return) [ C¾cilius (de Mort. Persecut. c. 48) has preserved the</a>
<a id='line_209'>Latin original; and Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. l. x. c. 5) has given a</a>
<a id='line_210'>Greek translation of this perpetual edict, which refers to some</a>
<a id='line_211'>provisional regulations.]</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the</a>
<a id='line_214'>civil and religious rights of which the Christians had been so unjustly</a>
<a id='line_215'>deprived. It was enacted that the places of worship, and public lands,</a>
<a id='line_216'>which had been confiscated, should be restored to the church, without</a>
<a id='line_217'>dispute, without delay, and without expense; and this severe injunction</a>
<a id='line_218'>was accompanied with a gracious promise, that if any of the purchasers</a>
<a id='line_219'>had paid a fair and adequate price, they should be indemnified from the</a>
<a id='line_220'>Imperial treasury. The salutary regulations which guard the future</a>
<a id='line_221'>tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged</a>
<a id='line_222'>and equal toleration; and such an equality must have been interpreted</a>
<a id='line_223'>by a recent sect as an advantageous and honorable distinction. The two</a>
<a id='line_224'>emperors proclaim to the world, that they have granted a free and</a>
<a id='line_225'>absolute power to the Christians, and to all others, of following the</a>
<a id='line_226'>religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer, to which he has</a>
<a id='line_227'>addicted his mind, and which he may deem the best adapted to his own</a>
<a id='line_228'>use. They carefully explain every ambiguous word, remove every</a>
<a id='line_229'>exception, and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict</a>
<a id='line_230'>obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict, which was</a>
<a id='line_231'>designed to establish and secure, without any limitation, the claims of</a>
<a id='line_232'>religious liberty. They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which</a>
<a id='line_233'>have induced them to allow this universal toleration: the humane</a>
<a id='line_234'>intention of consulting the peace and happiness of their people; and</a>
<a id='line_235'>the pious hope, that, by such a conduct, they shall appease and</a>
<a id='line_236'>propitiate _the Deity_, whose seat is in heaven. They gratefully</a>
<a id='line_237'>acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the</a>
<a id='line_238'>divine favor; and they trust that the same Providence will forever</a>
<a id='line_239'>continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people. From these</a>
<a id='line_240'>vague and indefinite expressions of piety, three suppositions may be</a>
<a id='line_241'>deduced, of a different, but not of an incompatible nature. The mind of</a>
<a id='line_242'>Constantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Christian</a>
<a id='line_243'>religions. According to the loose and complying notions of Polytheism,</a>
<a id='line_244'>he might acknowledge the God of the Christians as _one_ of the _many_</a>
<a id='line_245'>deities who compose the hierarchy of heaven. Or perhaps he might</a>
<a id='line_246'>embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea, that, notwithstanding the</a>
<a id='line_247'>variety of names, of rites, and of opinions, all the sects, and all the</a>
<a id='line_248'>nations of mankind, are united in the worship of the common Father and</a>
<a id='line_249'>Creator of the universe. 16</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>16 (return) [ A panegyric of Constantine, pronounced seven or eight</a>
<a id='line_252'>months after the edict of Milan, (see Gothofred. Chronolog. Legum, p.</a>
<a id='line_253'>7, and Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 246,) uses the</a>
<a id='line_254'>following remarkable expression: ÒSumme rerum sator, cujus tot nomina</a>
<a id='line_255'>sant, quot linguas gentium esse voluisti, quem enim te ipse dici velin,</a>
<a id='line_256'>scire non possumus.Ó (Panegyr. Vet. ix. 26.) In explaining</a>
<a id='line_257'>ConstantineÕs progress in the faith, Mosheim (p. 971, &c.) is</a>
<a id='line_258'>ingenious, subtle, prolix.]</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>But the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of</a>
<a id='line_261'>temporal advantage, than by considerations of abstract and speculative</a>
<a id='line_262'>truth. The partial and increasing favor of Constantine may naturally be</a>
<a id='line_263'>referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of</a>
<a id='line_264'>the Christians; and to a persuasion, that the propagation of the gospel</a>
<a id='line_265'>would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue. Whatever</a>
<a id='line_266'>latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct, whatever</a>
<a id='line_267'>indulgence he may claim for his own passions, it is undoubtedly his</a>
<a id='line_268'>interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil</a>
<a id='line_269'>obligations of society. But the operation of the wisest laws is</a>
<a id='line_270'>imperfect and precarious. They seldom inspire virtue, they cannot</a>
<a id='line_271'>always restrain vice. Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that</a>
<a id='line_272'>they condemn, nor can they always punish the actions which they</a>
<a id='line_273'>prohibit. The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the</a>
<a id='line_274'>powers of education and of opinion. But every principle which had once</a>
<a id='line_275'>maintained the vigor and purity of Rome and Sparta, was long since</a>
<a id='line_276'>extinguished in a declining and despotic empire. Philosophy still</a>
<a id='line_277'>exercised her temperate sway over the human mind, but the cause of</a>
<a id='line_278'>virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the Pagan</a>
<a id='line_279'>superstition. Under these discouraging circumstances, a prudent</a>
<a id='line_280'>magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which</a>
<a id='line_281'>diffused among the people a pure, benevolent, and universal system of</a>

<a id='line_286'>manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine</a>
<a id='line_287'>revelation; and Constantine might listen with some confidence to the</a>
<a id='line_288'>flattering, and indeed reasonable, assurances of Lactantius. The</a>
<a id='line_289'>eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect, and almost ventured to</a>
<a id='line_290'>promise, _that_ the establishment of Christianity would restore the</a>
<a id='line_291'>innocence and felicity of the primitive age; _that_ the worship of the</a>
<a id='line_292'>true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually</a>
<a id='line_293'>considered themselves as the children of a common parent; _that_ every</a>
<a id='line_294'>impure desire, every angry or selfish passion, would be restrained by</a>
<a id='line_295'>the knowledge of the gospel; and _that_ the magistrates might sheath</a>
<a id='line_296'>the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated</a>
<a id='line_297'>by the sentiments of truth and piety, of equity and moderation, of</a>

<a id='line_304'>The passive and unresisting obedience, which bows under the yoke of</a>

<a id='line_307'>virtues. 18 The primitive Christians derived the institution of civil</a>
<a id='line_308'>government, not from the consent of the people, but from the decrees of</a>
<a id='line_309'>Heaven. The reigning emperor, though he had usurped the sceptre by</a>
<a id='line_310'>treason and murder, immediately assumed the sacred character of</a>
<a id='line_311'>vicegerent of the Deity. To the Deity alone he was accountable for the</a>
<a id='line_312'>abuse of his power; and his subjects were indissolubly bound, by their</a>
<a id='line_313'>oath of fidelity, to a tyrant, who had violated every law of nature and</a>
<a id='line_314'>society. The humble Christians were sent into the world as sheep among</a>
<a id='line_315'>wolves; and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the</a>
<a id='line_316'>defence of their religion, they should be still more criminal if they</a>
<a id='line_317'>were tempted to shed the blood of their fellow-creatures in disputing</a>
<a id='line_318'>the vain privileges, or the sordid possessions, of this transitory</a>
<a id='line_319'>life. Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle, who in the reign of Nero</a>
<a id='line_320'>had preached the duty of unconditional submission, the Christians of</a>
<a id='line_321'>the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent</a>
<a id='line_322'>of the guilt of secret conspiracy, or open rebellion. While they</a>
<a id='line_323'>experienced the rigor of persecution, they were never provoked either</a>
<a id='line_324'>to meet their tyrants in the field, or indignantly to withdraw</a>
<a id='line_325'>themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe. 19 The</a>

<a id='line_327'>such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom, have been</a>
<a id='line_328'>insulted by the invidious comparison between the conduct of the</a>
<a id='line_329'>primitive and of the reformed Christians. 20 Perhaps, instead of</a>
<a id='line_330'>censure, some applause may be due to the superior sense and spirit of</a>
<a id='line_331'>our ancestors, who had convinced themselves that religion cannot</a>
<a id='line_332'>abolish the unalienable rights of human nature. 21 Perhaps the patience</a>

<a id='line_373'>examples of the more immediate interposition of the Deity in the</a>

<a id='line_378'>deliverance or the triumph of the church. If the judges of Israel were</a>

<a id='line_380'>the royal unction of their great ancestor an hereditary and</a>
<a id='line_381'>indefeasible right, which could not be forfeited by their own vices,</a>
<a id='line_382'>nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects. The same extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_383'>providence, which was no longer confined to the Jewish people, might</a>
<a id='line_384'>elect Constantine and his family as the protectors of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_385'>world; and the devout Lactantius announces, in a prophetic tone, the</a>
<a id='line_386'>future glories of his long and universal reign. 22 Galerius and</a>
<a id='line_387'>Maximin, Maxentius and Licinius, were the rivals who shared with the</a>
<a id='line_388'>favorite of heaven the provinces of the empire. The tragic deaths of</a>
<a id='line_389'>Galerius and Maximin soon gratified the resentment, and fulfilled the</a>
<a id='line_390'>sanguine expectations, of the Christians. The success of Constantine</a>
<a id='line_391'>against Maxentius and Licinius removed the two formidable competitors</a>
<a id='line_392'>who still opposed the triumph of the second David, and his cause might</a>
<a id='line_393'>seem to claim the peculiar interposition of Providence. The character</a>
<a id='line_394'>of the Roman tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature; and though</a>
<a id='line_395'>the Christians might enjoy his precarious favor, they were exposed,</a>
<a id='line_396'>with the rest of his subjects, to the effects of his wanton and</a>
<a id='line_397'>capricious cruelty. The conduct of Licinius soon betrayed the</a>
<a id='line_398'>reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and humane</a>
<a id='line_399'>regulations of the edict of Milan. The convocation of provincial synods</a>
<a id='line_400'>was prohibited in his dominions; his Christian officers were</a>
<a id='line_401'>ignominiously dismissed; and if he avoided the guilt, or rather danger,</a>
<a id='line_402'>of a general persecution, his partial oppressions were rendered still</a>
<a id='line_403'>more odious by the violation of a solemn and voluntary engagement. 23</a>

<a id='line_409'>the Christians, that their hero was inspired, and conducted, by the</a>

<a id='line_412'>Constantine with the sole dominion of the Roman world, he immediately,</a>

<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>The assurance that the elevation of Constantine was intimately</a>
<a id='line_431'>connected with the designs of Providence, instilled into the minds of</a>
<a id='line_432'>the Christians two opinions, which, by very different means, assisted</a>
<a id='line_433'>the accomplishment of the prophecy. Their warm and active loyalty</a>
<a id='line_434'>exhausted in his favor every resource of human industry; and they</a>
<a id='line_435'>confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by</a>
<a id='line_436'>some divine and miraculous aid. The enemies of Constantine have imputed</a>
<a id='line_437'>to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with</a>
<a id='line_438'>the Catholic church, and which apparently contributed to the success of</a>
<a id='line_439'>his ambition. In the beginning of the fourth century, the Christians</a>
<a id='line_440'>still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the</a>
<a id='line_441'>empire; but among a degenerate people, who viewed the change of masters</a>
<a id='line_442'>with the indifference of slaves, the spirit and union of a religious</a>
<a id='line_443'>party might assist the popular leader, to whose service, from a</a>
<a id='line_444'>principle of conscience, they had devoted their lives and fortunes. 25</a>
<a id='line_445'>The example of his father had instructed Constantine to esteem and to</a>
<a id='line_446'>reward the merit of the Christians; and in the distribution of public</a>
<a id='line_447'>offices, he had the advantage of strengthening his government, by the</a>
<a id='line_448'>choice of ministers or generals, in whose fidelity he could repose a</a>
<a id='line_449'>just and unreserved confidence. By the influence of these dignified</a>
<a id='line_450'>missionaries, the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in</a>
<a id='line_451'>the court and army; the Barbarians of Germany, who filled the ranks of</a>
<a id='line_452'>the legions, were of a careless temper, which acquiesced without</a>
<a id='line_453'>resistance in the religion of their commander; and when they passed the</a>
<a id='line_454'>Alps, it may fairly be presumed, that a great number of the soldiers</a>
<a id='line_455'>had already consecrated their swords to the service of Christ and of</a>
<a id='line_456'>Constantine. 26 The habits of mankind and the interests of religion</a>
<a id='line_457'>gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed, which had so long</a>
<a id='line_458'>prevailed among the Christians; and in the councils which were</a>
<a id='line_459'>assembled under the gracious protection of Constantine, the authority</a>
<a id='line_460'>of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the</a>
<a id='line_461'>military oath, and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those</a>
<a id='line_462'>soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church. 27</a>
<a id='line_463'>While Constantine, in his own dominions, increased the number and zeal</a>
<a id='line_464'>of his faithful adherents, he could depend on the support of a powerful</a>
<a id='line_465'>faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his</a>
<a id='line_466'>rivals. A secret disaffection was diffused among the Christian subjects</a>
<a id='line_467'>of Maxentius and Licinius; and the resentment, which the latter did not</a>
<a id='line_468'>attempt to conceal, served only to engage them still more deeply in the</a>
<a id='line_469'>interest of his competitor. The regular correspondence which connected</a>
<a id='line_470'>the bishops of the most distant provinces, enabled them freely to</a>
<a id='line_471'>communicate their wishes and their designs, and to transmit without</a>
<a id='line_472'>danger any useful intelligence, or any pious contributions, which might</a>
<a id='line_473'>promote the service of Constantine, who publicly declared that he had</a>

<a id='line_504'>The enthusiasm which inspired the troops, and perhaps the emperor</a>
<a id='line_505'>himself, had sharpened their swords while it satisfied their</a>
<a id='line_506'>conscience. They marched to battle with the full assurance, that the</a>
<a id='line_507'>same God, who had formerly opened a passage to the Israelites through</a>
<a id='line_508'>the waters of Jordan, and had thrown down the walls of Jericho at the</a>

<a id='line_510'>power in the victory of Constantine. The evidence of ecclesiastical</a>

<a id='line_514'>imaginary cause of so important an event, deserves and demands the</a>
<a id='line_515'>attention of posterity; and I shall endeavor to form a just estimate of</a>
<a id='line_516'>the famous vision of Constantine, by a distinct consideration of the</a>
<a id='line_517'>_standard_, the _dream_, and the _celestial sign;_ by separating the</a>
<a id='line_518'>historical, the natural, and the marvellous parts of this extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_519'>story, which, in the composition of a specious argument, have been</a>
<a id='line_520'>artfully confounded in one splendid and brittle mass.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>I. An instrument of the tortures which were inflicted only on slaves</a>
<a id='line_523'>and strangers, became on object of horror in the eyes of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_524'>citizen; and the ideas of guilt, of pain, and of ignominy, were closely</a>
<a id='line_525'>united with the idea of the cross. 29 The piety, rather than the</a>
<a id='line_526'>humanity, of Constantine soon abolished in his dominions the punishment</a>
<a id='line_527'>which the Savior of mankind had condescended to suffer; 30 but the</a>
<a id='line_528'>emperor had already learned to despise the prejudices of his education,</a>
<a id='line_529'>and of his people, before he could erect in the midst of Rome his own</a>
<a id='line_530'>statue, bearing a cross in its right hand; with an inscription which</a>
<a id='line_531'>referred the victory of his arms, and the deliverance of Rome, to the</a>
<a id='line_532'>virtue of that salutary sign, the true symbol of force and courage. 31</a>
<a id='line_533'>The same symbol sanctified the arms of the soldiers of Constantine; the</a>
<a id='line_534'>cross glittered on their helmet, was engraved on their shields, was</a>
<a id='line_535'>interwoven into their banners; and the consecrated emblems which</a>
<a id='line_536'>adorned the person of the emperor himself, were distinguished only by</a>
<a id='line_537'>richer materials and more exquisite workmanship. 32 But the principal</a>
<a id='line_538'>standard which displayed the triumph of the cross was styled the</a>
<a id='line_539'>Labarum, 33 an obscure, though celebrated name, which has been vainly</a>
<a id='line_540'>derived from almost all the languages of the world. It is described 34</a>
<a id='line_541'>as a long pike intersected by a transversal beam. The silken veil,</a>
<a id='line_542'>which hung down from the beam, was curiously inwrought with the images</a>
<a id='line_543'>of the reigning monarch and his children. The summit of the pike</a>
<a id='line_544'>supported a crown of gold which enclosed the mysterious monogram, at</a>
<a id='line_545'>once expressive of the figure of the cross, and the initial letters, of</a>
<a id='line_546'>the name of Christ. 35 The safety of the labarum was intrusted to fifty</a>
<a id='line_547'>guards, of approved valor and fidelity; their station was marked by</a>
<a id='line_548'>honors and emoluments; and some fortunate accidents soon introduced an</a>
<a id='line_549'>opinion, that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the</a>
<a id='line_550'>execution of their office, they were secure and invulnerable amidst the</a>
<a id='line_551'>darts of the enemy. In the second civil war, Licinius felt and dreaded</a>
<a id='line_552'>the power of this consecrated banner, the sight of which, in the</a>
<a id='line_553'>distress of battle, animated the soldiers of Constantine with an</a>
<a id='line_554'>invincible enthusiasm, and scattered terror and dismay through the</a>
<a id='line_555'>ranks of the adverse legions. 36 The Christian emperors, who respected</a>
<a id='line_556'>the example of Constantine, displayed in all their military expeditions</a>
<a id='line_557'>the standard of the cross; but when the degenerate successors of</a>
<a id='line_558'>Theodosius had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies,</a>
<a id='line_559'>the labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the</a>
<a id='line_560'>palace of Constantinople. 37 Its honors are still preserved on the</a>
<a id='line_561'>medals of the Flavian family. Their grateful devotion has placed the</a>
<a id='line_562'>monogram of Christ in the midst of the ensigns of Rome. The solemn</a>
<a id='line_563'>epithets of, safety of the republic, glory of the army, restoration of</a>

<a id='line_646'>of Constantine, who in the same prudent and gradual progress</a>
<a id='line_647'>acknowledged the truth, and assumed the symbol, of Christianity. But</a>
<a id='line_648'>the testimony of a contemporary writer, who in a formal treatise has</a>
<a id='line_649'>avenged the cause of religion, bestows on the piety of the emperor a</a>
<a id='line_650'>more awful and sublime character. He affirms, with the most perfect</a>
<a id='line_651'>confidence, that in the night which preceded the last battle against</a>
<a id='line_652'>Maxentius, Constantine was admonished in a dream 39a to inscribe the</a>
<a id='line_653'>shields of his soldiers with the _celestial sign of God_, the sacred</a>
<a id='line_654'>monogram of the name of Christ; that he executed the commands of</a>
<a id='line_655'>Heaven, and that his valor and obedience were rewarded by the decisive</a>
<a id='line_656'>victory of the Milvian Bridge. Some considerations might perhaps</a>
<a id='line_657'>incline a sceptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity of the</a>
<a id='line_658'>rhetorician, whose pen, either from zeal or interest, was devoted to</a>
<a id='line_659'>the cause of the prevailing faction. 40 He appears to have published</a>
<a id='line_660'>his deaths of the persecutors at Nicomedia about three years after the</a>
<a id='line_661'>Roman victory; but the interval of a thousand miles, and a thousand</a>
<a id='line_662'>days, will allow an ample latitude for the invention of declaimers, the</a>
<a id='line_663'>credulity of party, and the tacit approbation of the emperor himself</a>
<a id='line_664'>who might listen without indignation to a marvellous tale, which</a>
<a id='line_665'>exalted his fame, and promoted his designs. In favor of Licinius, who</a>
<a id='line_666'>still dissembled his animosity to the Christians, the same author has</a>
<a id='line_667'>provided a similar vision, of a form of prayer, which was communicated</a>
<a id='line_668'>by an angel, and repeated by the whole army before they engaged the</a>
<a id='line_669'>legions of the tyrant Maximin. The frequent repetition of miracles</a>
<a id='line_670'>serves to provoke, where it does not subdue, the reason of mankind; 41</a>
<a id='line_671'>but if the dream of Constantine is separately considered, it may be</a>
<a id='line_672'>naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the</a>
<a id='line_673'>emperor. Whilst his anxiety for the approaching day, which must decide</a>
<a id='line_674'>the fate of the empire, was suspended by a short and interrupted</a>
<a id='line_675'>slumber, the venerable form of Christ, and the well-known symbol of his</a>
<a id='line_676'>religion, might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a</a>
<a id='line_677'>prince who reverenced the name, and had perhaps secretly implored the</a>
<a id='line_678'>power, of the God of the Christians. As readily might a consummate</a>
<a id='line_679'>statesman indulge himself in the use of one of those military</a>
<a id='line_680'>stratagems, one of those pious frauds, which Philip and Sertorius had</a>
<a id='line_681'>employed with such art and effect. 42 The pr¾ternatural origin of</a>
<a id='line_682'>dreams was universally admitted by the nations of antiquity, and a</a>
<a id='line_683'>considerable part of the Gallic army was already prepared to place</a>
<a id='line_684'>their confidence in the salutary sign of the Christian religion. The</a>
<a id='line_685'>secret vision of Constantine could be disproved only by the event; and</a>
<a id='line_686'>the intrepid hero who had passed the Alps and the Apennine, might view</a>
<a id='line_687'>with careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of</a>
<a id='line_688'>Rome. The senate and people, exulting in their own deliverance from an</a>
<a id='line_689'>odious tyrant, acknowledged that the victory of Constantine surpassed</a>
<a id='line_690'>the powers of man, without daring to insinuate that it had been</a>
<a id='line_691'>obtained by the protection of the _Gods_. The triumphal arch, which was</a>
<a id='line_692'>erected about three years after the event, proclaims, in ambiguous</a>
<a id='line_693'>language, that by the greatness of his own mind, and by an _instinct_</a>
<a id='line_694'>or impulse of the Divinity, he had saved and avenged the Roman</a>
<a id='line_695'>republic. 43 The Pagan orator, who had seized an earlier opportunity of</a>
<a id='line_696'>celebrating the virtues of the conqueror, supposes that he alone</a>
<a id='line_697'>enjoyed a secret and intimate commerce with the Supreme Being, who</a>
<a id='line_698'>delegated the care of mortals to his subordinate deities; and thus</a>
<a id='line_699'>assigns a very plausible reason why the subjects of Constantine should</a>

<a id='line_758'>have sometimes been deceived by fraud, the understanding of the readers</a>
<a id='line_759'>has much more frequently been insulted by fiction. Every event, or</a>
<a id='line_760'>appearance, or accident, which seems to deviate from the ordinary</a>
<a id='line_761'>course of nature, has been rashly ascribed to the immediate action of</a>
<a id='line_762'>the Deity; and the astonished fancy of the multitude has sometimes</a>
<a id='line_763'>given shape and color, language and motion, to the fleeting but</a>
<a id='line_764'>uncommon meteors of the air. 45 Nazarius and Eusebius are the two most</a>
<a id='line_765'>celebrated orators, who, in studied panegyrics, have labored to exalt</a>
<a id='line_766'>the glory of Constantine. Nine years after the Roman victory, Nazarius</a>
<a id='line_767'>46 describes an army of divine warriors, who seemed to fall from the</a>
<a id='line_768'>sky: he marks their beauty, their spirit, their gigantic forms, the</a>
<a id='line_769'>stream of light which beamed from their celestial armor, their patience</a>
<a id='line_770'>in suffering themselves to be heard, as well as seen, by mortals; and</a>
<a id='line_771'>their declaration that they were sent, that they flew, to the</a>
<a id='line_772'>assistance of the great Constantine. For the truth of this prodigy, the</a>
<a id='line_773'>Pagan orator appeals to the whole Gallic nation, in whose presence he</a>
<a id='line_774'>was then speaking; and seems to hope that the ancient apparitions 47</a>
<a id='line_775'>would now obtain credit from this recent and public event. The</a>
<a id='line_776'>Christian fable of Eusebius, which, in the space of twenty-six years,</a>
<a id='line_777'>might arise from the original dream, is cast in a much more correct and</a>
<a id='line_778'>elegant mould. In one of the marches of Constantine, he is reported to</a>
<a id='line_779'>have seen with his own eyes the luminous trophy of the cross, placed</a>
<a id='line_780'>above the meridian sun and inscribed with the following words: BY THIS</a>
<a id='line_781'>CONQUER. This amazing object in the sky astonished the whole army, as</a>
<a id='line_782'>well as the emperor himself, who was yet undetermined in the choice of</a>
<a id='line_783'>a religion: but his astonishment was converted into faith by the vision</a>
<a id='line_784'>of the ensuing night. Christ appeared before his eyes; and displaying</a>
<a id='line_785'>the same celestial sign of the cross, he directed Constantine to frame</a>
<a id='line_786'>a similar standard, and to march, with an assurance of victory, against</a>
<a id='line_787'>Maxentius and all his enemies. 48 The learned bishop of C¾sarea appears</a>
<a id='line_788'>to be sensible, that the recent discovery of this marvellous anecdote</a>
<a id='line_789'>would excite some surprise and distrust among the most pious of his</a>
<a id='line_790'>readers. Yet, instead of ascertaining the precise circumstances of time</a>
<a id='line_791'>and place, which always serve to detect falsehood or establish truth;</a>
<a id='line_792'>49 instead of collecting and recording the evidence of so many living</a>
<a id='line_793'>witnesses who must have been spectators of this stupendous miracle; 50</a>
<a id='line_794'>Eusebius contents himself with alleging a very singular testimony; that</a>
<a id='line_795'>of the deceased Constantine, who, many years after the event, in the</a>
<a id='line_796'>freedom of conversation, had related to him this extraordinary incident</a>
<a id='line_797'>of his own life, and had attested the truth of it by a solemn oath. The</a>
<a id='line_798'>prudence and gratitude of the learned prelate forbade him to suspect</a>
<a id='line_799'>the veracity of his victorious master; but he plainly intimates, that</a>
<a id='line_800'>in a fact of such a nature, he should have refused his assent to any</a>
<a id='line_801'>meaner authority. This motive of credibility could not survive the</a>
<a id='line_802'>power of the Flavian family; and the celestial sign, which the Infidels</a>
<a id='line_803'>might afterwards deride, 51 was disregarded by the Christians of the</a>
<a id='line_804'>age which immediately followed the conversion of Constantine. 52 But</a>
<a id='line_805'>the Catholic church, both of the East and of the West, has adopted a</a>
<a id='line_806'>prodigy which favors, or seems to favor, the popular worship of the</a>

<a id='line_808'>legend of superstition, till the bold and sagacious spirit of criticism</a>

<a id='line_878'>The Protestant and philosophic readers of the present age will incline</a>
<a id='line_879'>to believe, that in the account of his own conversion, Constantine</a>
<a id='line_880'>attested a wilful falsehood by a solemn and deliberate perjury. They</a>
<a id='line_881'>may not hesitate to pronounce, that in the choice of a religion, his</a>
<a id='line_882'>mind was determined only by a sense of interest; and that (according to</a>
<a id='line_883'>the expression of a profane poet) 54 he used the altars of the church</a>
<a id='line_884'>as a convenient footstool to the throne of the empire. A conclusion so</a>
<a id='line_885'>harsh and so absolute is not, however, warranted by our knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_886'>human nature, of Constantine, or of Christianity. In an age of</a>
<a id='line_887'>religious fervor, the most artful statesmen are observed to feel some</a>
<a id='line_888'>part of the enthusiasm which they inspire, and the most orthodox saints</a>
<a id='line_889'>assume the dangerous privilege of defending the cause of truth by the</a>
<a id='line_890'>arms of deceit and falsehood.</a>
<a id='line_891'></a>
<a id='line_892'>Personal interest is often the standard of our belief, as well as of</a>
<a id='line_893'>our practice; and the same motives of temporal advantage which might</a>
<a id='line_894'>influence the public conduct and professions of Constantine, would</a>
<a id='line_895'>insensibly dispose his mind to embrace a religion so propitious to his</a>
<a id='line_896'>fame and fortunes. His vanity was gratified by the flattering</a>
<a id='line_897'>assurance, that _he_ had been chosen by Heaven to reign over the earth;</a>
<a id='line_898'>success had justified his divine title to the throne, and that title</a>
<a id='line_899'>was founded on the truth of the Christian revelation. As real virtue is</a>
<a id='line_900'>sometimes excited by undeserved applause, the specious piety of</a>
<a id='line_901'>Constantine, if at first it was only specious, might gradually, by the</a>
<a id='line_902'>influence of praise, of habit, and of example, be matured into serious</a>
<a id='line_903'>faith and fervent devotion. The bishops and teachers of the new sect,</a>
<a id='line_904'>whose dress and manners had not qualified them for the residence of a</a>
<a id='line_905'>court, were admitted to the Imperial table; they accompanied the</a>
<a id='line_906'>monarch in his expeditions; and the ascendant which one of them, an</a>
<a id='line_907'>Egyptian or a Spaniard, 55 acquired over his mind, was imputed by the</a>
<a id='line_908'>Pagans to the effect of magic. 56 Lactantius, who has adorned the</a>
<a id='line_909'>precepts of the gospel with the eloquence of Cicero, 57 and Eusebius,</a>
<a id='line_910'>who has consecrated the learning and philosophy of the Greeks to the</a>
<a id='line_911'>service of religion, 58 were both received into the friendship and</a>
<a id='line_912'>familiarity of their sovereign; and those able masters of controversy</a>
<a id='line_913'>could patiently watch the soft and yielding moments of persuasion, and</a>
<a id='line_914'>dexterously apply the arguments which were the best adapted to his</a>
<a id='line_915'>character and understanding. Whatever advantages might be derived from</a>
<a id='line_916'>the acquisition of an Imperial proselyte, he was distinguished by the</a>
<a id='line_917'>splendor of his purple, rather than by the superiority of wisdom, or</a>
<a id='line_918'>virtue, from the many thousands of his subjects who had embraced the</a>
<a id='line_919'>doctrines of Christianity. Nor can it be deemed incredible, that the</a>
<a id='line_920'>mind of an unlettered soldier should have yielded to the weight of</a>
<a id='line_921'>evidence, which, in a more enlightened age, has satisfied or subdued</a>
<a id='line_922'>the reason of a Grotius, a Pascal, or a Locke. In the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_923'>incessant labors of his great office, this soldier employed, or</a>
<a id='line_924'>affected to employ, the hours of the night in the diligent study of the</a>
<a id='line_925'>Scriptures, and the composition of theological discourses; which he</a>
<a id='line_926'>afterwards pronounced in the presence of a numerous and applauding</a>
<a id='line_927'>audience. In a very long discourse, which is still extant, the royal</a>
<a id='line_928'>preacher expatiates on the various proofs still extant, the royal</a>

<a id='line_931'>eclogue of Virgil. 60 Forty years before the birth of Christ, the</a>
<a id='line_932'>Mantuan bard, as if inspired by the celestial muse of Isaiah, had</a>
<a id='line_933'>celebrated, with all the pomp of oriental metaphor, the return of the</a>
<a id='line_934'>Virgin, the fall of the serpent, the approaching birth of a godlike</a>
<a id='line_935'>child, the offspring of the great Jupiter, who should expiate the guilt</a>
<a id='line_936'>of human kind, and govern the peaceful universe with the virtues of his</a>
<a id='line_937'>father; the rise and appearance of a heavenly race, primitive nation</a>
<a id='line_938'>throughout the world; and the gradual restoration of the innocence and</a>
<a id='line_939'>felicity of the golden age. The poet was perhaps unconscious of the</a>
<a id='line_940'>secret sense and object of these sublime predictions, which have been</a>
<a id='line_941'>so unworthily applied to the infant son of a consul, or a triumvir; 61</a>

<a id='line_1007'>from the eyes of strangers, and even of catechu mens, with an affected</a>
<a id='line_1008'>secrecy, which served to excite their wonder and curiosity. 63 But the</a>
<a id='line_1009'>severe rules of discipline which the prudence of the bishops had</a>

<a id='line_1012'>condescension, into the pale of the church; and Constantine was</a>

<a id='line_1014'>privileges, before he had contracted _any_ of the obligations, of a</a>
<a id='line_1015'>Christian. Instead of retiring from the congregation, when the voice of</a>

<a id='line_1017'>faithful, disputed with the bishops, preached on the most sublime and</a>

<a id='line_1029'>the public vows to the Jupiter of the Capitoline Hill. 65 Many years</a>

<a id='line_1055'>The pride of Constantine, who refused the privileges of a catechumen,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>cannot easily be explained or excused; but the delay of his baptism may</a>
<a id='line_1057'>be justified by the maxims and the practice of ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_1058'>antiquity. The sacrament of baptism 67 was regularly administered by</a>
<a id='line_1059'>the bishop himself, with his assistant clergy, in the cathedral church</a>
<a id='line_1060'>of the diocese, during the fifty days between the solemn festivals of</a>
<a id='line_1061'>Easter and Pentecost; and this holy term admitted a numerous band of</a>
<a id='line_1062'>infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church. The discretion</a>
<a id='line_1063'>of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they</a>
<a id='line_1064'>could understand the obligations which they contracted: the severity of</a>
<a id='line_1065'>ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a novitiate of two or</a>
<a id='line_1066'>three years; and the catechumens themselves, from different motives of</a>
<a id='line_1067'>a temporal or a spiritual nature, were seldom impatient to assume the</a>
<a id='line_1068'>character of perfect and initiated Christians. The sacrament of baptism</a>
<a id='line_1069'>was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin; and the</a>
<a id='line_1070'>soul was instantly restored to its original purity, and entitled to the</a>
<a id='line_1071'>promise of eternal salvation. Among the proselytes of Christianity,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>there are many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>which could not be repeated; to throw away an inestimable privilege,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>which could never be recovered. By the delay of their baptism, they</a>
<a id='line_1075'>could venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyments of</a>
<a id='line_1076'>this world, while they still retained in their own hands the means of a</a>
<a id='line_1077'>sure and easy absolution. 68 The sublime theory of the gospel had made</a>
<a id='line_1078'>a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of</a>
<a id='line_1079'>Constantine himself. He pursued the great object of his ambition</a>
<a id='line_1080'>through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy; and, after the</a>
<a id='line_1081'>victory, he abandoned himself, without moderation, to the abuse of his</a>
<a id='line_1082'>fortune. Instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect</a>
<a id='line_1083'>heroism and profane philosophy of Trajan and the Antonines, the mature</a>
<a id='line_1084'>age of Constantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in</a>
<a id='line_1085'>his youth. As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth, he</a>
<a id='line_1086'>proportionally declined in the practice of virtue; and the same year of</a>
<a id='line_1087'>his reign in which he convened the council of Nice, was polluted by the</a>
<a id='line_1088'>execution, or rather murder, of his eldest son. This date is alone</a>
<a id='line_1089'>sufficient to refute the ignorant and malicious suggestions of Zosimus,</a>
<a id='line_1090'>69 who affirms, that, after the death of Crispus, the remorse of his</a>
<a id='line_1091'>father accepted from the ministers of christianity the expiation which</a>
<a id='line_1092'>he had vainly solicited from the Pagan pontiffs. At the time of the</a>
<a id='line_1093'>death of Crispus, the emperor could no longer hesitate in the choice of</a>
<a id='line_1094'>a religion; he could no longer be ignorant that the church was</a>
<a id='line_1095'>possessed of an infallible remedy, though he chose to defer the</a>
<a id='line_1096'>application of it till the approach of death had removed the temptation</a>
<a id='line_1097'>and danger of a relapse. The bishops whom he summoned, in his last</a>
<a id='line_1098'>illness, to the palace of Nicomedia, were edified by the fervor with</a>
<a id='line_1099'>which he requested and received the sacrament of baptism, by the solemn</a>
<a id='line_1100'>protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a</a>

<a id='line_1191'>by the narrow limits of his life, or of his dominions. The education</a>
<a id='line_1192'>which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race</a>
<a id='line_1193'>of princes, whose faith was still more lively and sincere, as they</a>
<a id='line_1194'>imbibed, in their earliest infancy, the spirit, or at least the</a>
<a id='line_1195'>doctrine, of Christianity. War and commerce had spread the knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_1196'>the gospel beyond the confines of the Roman provinces; and the</a>
<a id='line_1197'>Barbarians, who had disdained as humble and proscribed sect, soon</a>
<a id='line_1198'>learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the</a>
<a id='line_1199'>greatest monarch, and the most civilized nation, of the globe. 76 The</a>
<a id='line_1200'>Goths and Germans, who enlisted under the standard of Rome, revered the</a>
<a id='line_1201'>cross which glittered at the head of the legions, and their fierce</a>
<a id='line_1202'>countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of</a>
<a id='line_1203'>humanity. The kings of Iberia and Armenia76a worshipped the god of</a>
<a id='line_1204'>their protector; and their subjects, who have invariably preserved the</a>
<a id='line_1205'>name of Christians, soon formed a sacred and perpetual connection with</a>
<a id='line_1206'>their Roman brethren. The Christians of Persia were suspected, in time</a>
<a id='line_1207'>of war, of preferring their religion to their country; but as long as</a>
<a id='line_1208'>peace subsisted between the two empires, the persecuting spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_1209'>Magi was effectually restrained by the interposition of Constantine. 77</a>
<a id='line_1210'>The rays of the gospel illuminated the coast of India. The colonies of</a>

<a id='line_1322'>citizens was alike subject to the laws, and that the care of religion</a>
<a id='line_1323'>was the right as well as duty of the civil magistrate. Constantine and</a>

<a id='line_1332'>powers, 81 which had never been imposed on the free spirit of Greece</a>
<a id='line_1333'>and Rome, was introduced and confirmed by the legal establishment of</a>
<a id='line_1334'>Christianity. The office of supreme pontiff, which, from the time of</a>
<a id='line_1335'>Numa to that of Augustus, had always been exercised by one of the most</a>
<a id='line_1336'>eminent of the senators, was at length united to the Imperial dignity.</a>
<a id='line_1337'>The first magistrate of the state, as often as he was prompted by</a>

<a id='line_1341'>intimate communication with the gods. But in the Christian church,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>which instrusts the service of the altar to a perpetual succession of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>consecrated ministers, the monarch, whose spiritual rank is less</a>

<a id='line_1346'>multitude. 83 The emperor might be saluted as the father of his people,</a>
<a id='line_1347'>but he owed a filial duty and reverence to the fathers of the church;</a>
<a id='line_1348'>and the same marks of respect, which Constantine had paid to the</a>
<a id='line_1349'>persons of saints and confessors, were soon exacted by the pride of the</a>

<a id='line_1351'>ecclesiastical jurisdictions embarrassed the operation of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1352'>government; and a pious emperor was alarmed by the guilt and danger of</a>
<a id='line_1353'>touching with a profane hand the ark of the covenant. The separation of</a>
<a id='line_1354'>men into the two orders of the clergy and of the laity was, indeed,</a>

<a id='line_1357'>derived from a celestial origin the temporal power and possessions</a>

<a id='line_1361'>power served to cement the discipline of the primitive church. The</a>

<a id='line_1544'>and this extraordinary privilege might compensate, in some degree, for</a>
<a id='line_1545'>the painful celibacy 93 which was imposed as a virtue, as a duty, and</a>
<a id='line_1546'>at length as a positive obligation. The religions of antiquity, which</a>
<a id='line_1547'>established a separate order of priests, dedicated a holy race, a tribe</a>

<a id='line_1549'>were founded for possession, rather than conquest. The children of the</a>

<a id='line_1570'>ordained: the clergy of each episcopal church, with its dependent</a>

<a id='line_1684'>sovereign. An absolute monarch, who is rich without patrimony, may be</a>
<a id='line_1685'>charitable without merit; and Constantine too easily believed that he</a>
<a id='line_1686'>should purchase the favor of Heaven, if he maintained the idle at the</a>
<a id='line_1687'>expense of the industrious; and distributed among the saints the wealth</a>
<a id='line_1688'>of the republic. The same messenger who carried over to Africa the head</a>
<a id='line_1689'>of Maxentius, might be intrusted with an epistle to C¾cilian, bishop of</a>
<a id='line_1690'>Carthage. The emperor acquaints him, that the treasurers of the</a>
<a id='line_1691'>province are directed to pay into his hands the sum of three thousand</a>
<a id='line_1692'>_folles_, or eighteen thousand pounds sterling, and to obey his further</a>
<a id='line_1693'>requisitions for the relief of the churches of Africa, Numidia, and</a>
<a id='line_1694'>Mauritania. 103 The liberality of Constantine increased in a just</a>
<a id='line_1695'>proportion to his faith, and to his vices. He assigned in each city a</a>
<a id='line_1696'>regular allowance of corn, to supply the fund of ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_1697'>charity; and the persons of both sexes who embraced the monastic life</a>
<a id='line_1698'>became the peculiar favorites of their sovereign. The Christian temples</a>
<a id='line_1699'>of Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Constantinople &c., displayed the</a>
<a id='line_1700'>ostentatious piety of a prince, ambitious in a declining age to equal</a>
<a id='line_1701'>the perfect labors of antiquity. 104 The form of these religious</a>
<a id='line_1702'>edifices was simple and oblong; though they might sometimes swell into</a>
<a id='line_1703'>the shape of a dome, and sometimes branch into the figure of a cross.</a>
<a id='line_1704'>The timbers were framed for the most part of cedars of Libanus; the</a>
<a id='line_1705'>roof was covered with tiles, perhaps of gilt brass; and the walls, the</a>
<a id='line_1706'>columns, the pavement, were encrusted with variegated marbles. The most</a>
<a id='line_1707'>precious ornaments of gold and silver, of silk and gems, were profusely</a>
<a id='line_1708'>dedicated to the service of the altar; and this specious magnificence</a>
<a id='line_1709'>was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property. In</a>
<a id='line_1710'>the space of two centuries, from the reign of Constantine to that of</a>
<a id='line_1711'>Justinian, the eighteen hundred churches of the empire were enriched by</a>
<a id='line_1712'>the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people. An annual</a>
<a id='line_1713'>income of six hundred pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the</a>
<a id='line_1714'>bishops, who were placed at an equal distance between riches and</a>
<a id='line_1715'>poverty, 105 but the standard of their wealth insensibly rose with the</a>
<a id='line_1716'>dignity and opulence of the cities which they governed. An authentic</a>
<a id='line_1717'>but imperfect 106 rent-roll specifies some houses, shops, gardens, and</a>
<a id='line_1718'>farms, which belonged to the three _Basilic¾_ of Rome, St. Peter, St.</a>
<a id='line_1719'>Paul, and St. John Lateran, in the provinces of Italy, Africa, and the</a>
<a id='line_1720'>East. They produce, besides a reserved rent of oil, linen, paper,</a>
<a id='line_1721'>aromatics, &c., a clear annual revenue of twenty-two thousand pieces of</a>
<a id='line_1722'>gold, or twelve thousand pounds sterling. In the age of Constantine and</a>
<a id='line_1723'>Justinian, the bishops no longer possessed, perhaps they no longer</a>
<a id='line_1724'>deserved, the unsuspecting confidence of their clergy and people. The</a>
<a id='line_1725'>ecclesiastical revenues of each diocese were divided into four parts</a>
<a id='line_1726'>for the respective uses of the bishop himself, of his inferior clergy,</a>
<a id='line_1727'>of the poor, and of the public worship; and the abuse of this sacred</a>
<a id='line_1728'>trust was strictly and repeatedly checked. 107 The patrimony of the</a>
<a id='line_1729'>church was still subject to all the public compositions of the state.</a>

<a id='line_1801'>time, of accident, and of their own industry. But the liberality of the</a>
<a id='line_1802'>Christian emperors had actually endowed them with some legal</a>
<a id='line_1803'>prerogatives, which secured and dignified the sacerdotal character. 111</a>
<a id='line_1804'>1. Under a despotic government, the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted</a>
<a id='line_1805'>the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their _peers_, and</a>
<a id='line_1806'>even in a capital accusation, a synod of their brethren were the sole</a>

<a id='line_1808'>inflamed by personal resentment or religious discord, might be</a>
<a id='line_1809'>favorable, or even partial, to the sacerdotal order: but Constantine</a>
<a id='line_1810'>was satisfied, 112 that secret impunity would be less pernicious than</a>
<a id='line_1811'>public scandal: and the Nicene council was edited by his public</a>
<a id='line_1812'>declaration, that if he surprised a bishop in the act of adultery, he</a>
<a id='line_1813'>should cast his Imperial mantle over the episcopal sinner. 2. The</a>
<a id='line_1814'>domestic jurisdiction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a</a>
<a id='line_1815'>restraint of the ecclesiastical order, whose civil causes were decently</a>
<a id='line_1816'>withdrawn from the cognizance of a secular judge. Their venial offences</a>
<a id='line_1817'>were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment; and the</a>
<a id='line_1818'>gentle correction which the tenderness of youth may endure from its</a>
<a id='line_1819'>parents or instructors, was inflicted by the temperate severity of the</a>
<a id='line_1820'>bishops. But if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be</a>
<a id='line_1821'>sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honorable and</a>
<a id='line_1822'>beneficial profession, the Roman magistrate drew the sword of justice,</a>
<a id='line_1823'>without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities. 3. The arbitration of</a>
<a id='line_1824'>the bishops was ratified by a positive law; and the judges were</a>
<a id='line_1825'>instructed to execute, without appeal or delay, the episcopal decrees,</a>
<a id='line_1826'>whose validity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties. The</a>
<a id='line_1827'>conversion of the magistrates themselves, and of the whole empire,</a>
<a id='line_1828'>might gradually remove the fears and scruples of the Christians. But</a>
<a id='line_1829'>they still resorted to the tribunal of the bishops, whose abilities and</a>
<a id='line_1830'>integrity they esteemed; and the venerable Austin enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_1831'>satisfaction of complaining that his spiritual functions were</a>
<a id='line_1832'>perpetually interrupted by the invidious labor of deciding the claim or</a>
<a id='line_1833'>the possession of silver and gold, of lands and cattle. 4. The ancient</a>
<a id='line_1834'>privilege of sanctuary was transferred to the Christian temples, and</a>
<a id='line_1835'>extended, by the liberal piety of the younger Theodosius, to the</a>
<a id='line_1836'>precincts of consecrated ground. 113 The fugitive, and even guilty</a>
<a id='line_1837'>suppliants,were permitted to implore either the justice, or the mercy,</a>
<a id='line_1838'>of the Deity and his ministers. The rash violence of despotism was</a>

<a id='line_1973'>VI. Every popular government has experienced the effects of rude or</a>
<a id='line_1974'>artificial eloquence. The coldest nature is animated, the firmest</a>
<a id='line_1975'>reason is moved, by the rapid communication of the prevailing impulse;</a>
<a id='line_1976'>and each hearer is affected by his own passions, and by those of the</a>
<a id='line_1977'>surrounding multitude. The ruin of civil liberty had silenced the</a>
<a id='line_1978'>demagogues of Athens, and the tribunes of Rome; the custom of preaching</a>
<a id='line_1979'>which seems to constitute a considerable part of Christian devotion,</a>
<a id='line_1980'>had not been introduced into the temples of antiquity; and the ears of</a>
<a id='line_1981'>monarchs were never invaded by the harsh sound of popular eloquence,</a>
<a id='line_1982'>till the pulpits of the empire were filled with sacred orators, who</a>
<a id='line_1983'>possessed some advantages unknown to their profane predecessors. 122</a>
<a id='line_1984'>The arguments and rhetoric of the tribune were instantly opposed with</a>
<a id='line_1985'>equal arms, by skilful and resolute antagonists; and the cause of truth</a>
<a id='line_1986'>and reason might derive an accidental support from the conflict of</a>
<a id='line_1987'>hostile passions. The bishop, or some distinguished presbyter, to whom</a>
<a id='line_1988'>he cautiously delegated the powers of preaching, harangued, without the</a>
<a id='line_1989'>danger of interruption or reply, a submissive multitude, whose minds</a>
<a id='line_1990'>had been prepared and subdued by the awful ceremonies of religion. Such</a>
<a id='line_1991'>was the strict subordination of the Catholic church, that the same</a>
<a id='line_1992'>concerted sounds might issue at once from a hundred pulpits of Italy or</a>
<a id='line_1993'>Egypt, if they were _tuned_ 123 by the master hand of the Roman or</a>
<a id='line_1994'>Alexandrian primate. The design of this institution was laudable, but</a>
<a id='line_1995'>the fruits were not always salutary. The preachers recommended the</a>
<a id='line_1996'>practice of the social duties; but they exalted the perfection of</a>
<a id='line_1997'>monastic virtue, which is painful to the individual, and useless to</a>
<a id='line_1998'>mankind. Their charitable exhortations betrayed a secret wish that the</a>
<a id='line_1999'>clergy might be permitted to manage the wealth of the faithful, for the</a>
<a id='line_2000'>benefit of the poor. The most sublime representations of the attributes</a>
<a id='line_2001'>and laws of the Deity were sullied by an idle mixture of metaphysical</a>
<a id='line_2002'>subleties, puerile rites, and fictitious miracles: and they expatiated,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>with the most fervent zeal, on the religious merit of hating the</a>
<a id='line_2004'>adversaries, and obeying the ministers of the church. When the public</a>
<a id='line_2005'>peace was distracted by heresy and schism, the sacred orators sounded</a>
<a id='line_2006'>the trumpet of discord, and, perhaps, of sedition. The understandings</a>
<a id='line_2007'>of their congregations were perplexed by mystery, their passions were</a>
<a id='line_2008'>inflamed by invectives; and they rushed from the Christian temples of</a>
<a id='line_2009'>Antioch or Alexandria, prepared either to suffer or to inflict</a>
<a id='line_2010'>martyrdom. The corruption of taste and language is strongly marked in</a>
<a id='line_2011'>the vehement declamations of the Latin bishops; but the compositions of</a>
<a id='line_2012'>Gregory and Chrysostom have been compared with the most splendid models</a>
<a id='line_2013'>of Attic, or at least of Asiatic, eloquence. 124</a>

<a id='line_2032'>VII. The representatives of the Christian republic were regularly</a>
<a id='line_2033'>assembled in the spring and autumn of each year; and these synods</a>
<a id='line_2034'>diffused the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline and legislation</a>
<a id='line_2035'>through the hundred and twenty provinces of the Roman world. 125 The</a>
<a id='line_2036'>archbishop or metropolitan was empowered, by the laws, to summon the</a>
<a id='line_2037'>suffragan bishops of his province; to revise their conduct, to</a>
<a id='line_2038'>vindicate their rights, to declare their faith, and to examine the</a>
<a id='line_2039'>merits of the candidates who were elected by the clergy and people to</a>
<a id='line_2040'>supply the vacancies of the episcopal college. The primates of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_2041'>Alexandria, Antioch, Carthage, and afterwards Constantinople, who</a>
<a id='line_2042'>exercised a more ample jurisdiction, convened the numerous assembly of</a>
<a id='line_2043'>their dependent bishops. But the convocation of great and extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_2044'>synods was the prerogative of the emperor alone. Whenever the</a>
<a id='line_2045'>emergencies of the church required this decisive measure, he despatched</a>
<a id='line_2046'>a peremptory summons to the bishops, or the deputies of each province,</a>
<a id='line_2047'>with an order for the use of post-horses, and a competent allowance for</a>
<a id='line_2048'>the expenses of their journey. At an early period, when Constantine was</a>
<a id='line_2049'>the protector, rather than the proselyte, of Christianity, he referred</a>
<a id='line_2050'>the African controversy to the council of Arles; in which the bishops</a>
<a id='line_2051'>of York of Trves, of Milan, and of Carthage, met as friends and</a>
<a id='line_2052'>brethren, to debate in their native tongue on the common interest of</a>
<a id='line_2053'>the Latin or Western church. 126 Eleven years afterwards, a more</a>
<a id='line_2054'>numerous and celebrated assembly was convened at Nice in Bithynia, to</a>
<a id='line_2055'>extinguish, by their final sentence, the subtle disputes which had</a>
<a id='line_2056'>arisen in Egypt on the subject of the Trinity. Three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2057'>eighteen bishops obeyed the summons of their indulgent master; the</a>
<a id='line_2058'>ecclesiastics of every rank, and sect, and denomination, have been</a>
<a id='line_2059'>computed at two thousand and forty-eight persons; 127 the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_2060'>appeared in person; and the consent of the Latins was expressed by the</a>
<a id='line_2061'>legates of the Roman pontiff. The session, which lasted about two</a>
<a id='line_2062'>months, was frequently honored by the presence of the emperor. Leaving</a>
<a id='line_2063'>his guards at the door, he seated himself (with the permission of the</a>
<a id='line_2064'>council) on a low stool in the midst of the hall. Constantine listened</a>
<a id='line_2065'>with patience, and spoke with modesty: and while he influenced the</a>
<a id='line_2066'>debates, he humbly professed that he was the minister, not the judge,</a>
<a id='line_2067'>of the successors of the apostles, who had been established as priests</a>
<a id='line_2068'>and as gods upon earth. 128 Such profound reverence of an absolute</a>
<a id='line_2069'>monarch towards a feeble and unarmed assembly of his own subjects, can</a>
<a id='line_2070'>only be compared to the respect with which the senate had been treated</a>
<a id='line_2071'>by the Roman princes who adopted the policy of Augustus. Within the</a>
<a id='line_2072'>space of fifty years, a philosophic spectator of the vicissitudes of</a>
<a id='line_2073'>human affairs might have contemplated Tacitus in the senate of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>and Constantine in the council of Nice. The fathers of the Capitol and</a>
<a id='line_2075'>those of the church had alike degenerated from the virtues of their</a>
<a id='line_2076'>founders; but as the bishops were more deeply rooted in the public</a>
<a id='line_2077'>opinion, they sustained their dignity with more decent pride, and</a>
<a id='line_2078'>sometimes opposed with a manly spirit the wishes of their sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_2079'>The progress of time and superstition erased the memory of the</a>
<a id='line_2080'>weakness, the passion, the ignorance, which disgraced these</a>
