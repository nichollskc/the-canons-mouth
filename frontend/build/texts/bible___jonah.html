                    <a id='line_0'>Jonah</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,</a>
<a id='line_4'>saying, 1:2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it;</a>
<a id='line_5'>for their wickedness is come up before me.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_8'>LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish:</a>
<a id='line_9'>so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them</a>
<a id='line_10'>unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:4 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a</a>
<a id='line_13'>mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god,</a>
<a id='line_16'>and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to</a>
<a id='line_17'>lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the</a>
<a id='line_18'>ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest</a>
<a id='line_21'>thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will</a>
<a id='line_22'>think upon us, that we perish not.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,</a>
<a id='line_25'>that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast</a>
<a id='line_26'>lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause</a>
<a id='line_29'>this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest</a>
<a id='line_30'>thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?  1:9 And he</a>
<a id='line_31'>said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of</a>
<a id='line_32'>heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast</a>
<a id='line_35'>thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_36'>LORD, because he had told them.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea</a>
<a id='line_39'>may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the</a>
<a id='line_42'>sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake</a>
<a id='line_43'>this great tempest is upon you.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they</a>
<a id='line_46'>could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:14 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O</a>
<a id='line_49'>LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay</a>
<a id='line_50'>not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased</a>
<a id='line_51'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the</a>
<a id='line_54'>sea ceased from her raging.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_57'>unto the LORD, and made vows.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>1:17 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And</a>
<a id='line_60'>Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly,</a>
<a id='line_63'>2:2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_64'>he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my</a>
<a id='line_65'>voice.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;</a>
<a id='line_68'>and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves</a>
<a id='line_69'>passed over me.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>2:4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again</a>
<a id='line_72'>toward thy holy temple.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>2:5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed</a>
<a id='line_75'>me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her</a>
<a id='line_78'>bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from</a>
<a id='line_79'>corruption, O LORD my God.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my</a>
<a id='line_82'>prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I</a>
<a id='line_87'>will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>2:10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon</a>
<a id='line_90'>the dry land.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>3:1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</a>
<a id='line_93'>3:2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the</a>
<a id='line_94'>preaching that I bid thee.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>3:3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of</a>
<a id='line_97'>the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’</a>
<a id='line_98'>journey.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>3:4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he</a>
<a id='line_101'>cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>3:5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and</a>
<a id='line_104'>put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>3:6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his</a>
<a id='line_107'>throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,</a>
<a id='line_108'>and sat in ashes.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>3:7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by</a>
<a id='line_111'>the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor</a>
<a id='line_112'>beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink</a>
<a id='line_113'>water: 3:8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry</a>
<a id='line_114'>mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and</a>
<a id='line_115'>from the violence that is in their hands.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>3:9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his</a>
<a id='line_118'>fierce anger, that we perish not?  3:10 And God saw their works, that</a>
<a id='line_119'>they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he</a>
<a id='line_120'>had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>4:1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>4:2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was</a>
<a id='line_125'>not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled</a>
<a id='line_126'>before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and</a>
<a id='line_127'>merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of</a>
<a id='line_128'>the evil.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>4:3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for</a>
<a id='line_131'>it is better for me to die than to live.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>4:4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?  4:5 So Jonah</a>
<a id='line_134'>went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there</a>
<a id='line_135'>made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see</a>
<a id='line_136'>what would become of the city.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>4:6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over</a>
<a id='line_139'>Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from</a>
<a id='line_140'>his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>4:7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it</a>
<a id='line_143'>smote the gourd that it withered.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>4:8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a</a>
<a id='line_146'>vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he</a>
<a id='line_147'>fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me</a>
<a id='line_148'>to die than to live.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>4:9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?</a>
<a id='line_151'>And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>4:10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the</a>
<a id='line_154'>which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in</a>
<a id='line_155'>a night, and perished in a night: 4:11 And should not I spare Nineveh,</a>
<a id='line_156'>that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that</a>
<a id='line_157'>cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also</a>
<a id='line_158'>much cattle?</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
