<a id='line_10'>      In the apprehension of modern times, Petrarch 1 is the Italian</a>
<a id='line_11'>      songster of Laura and love. In the harmony of his Tuscan rhymes,</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Italy applauds, or rather adores, the father of her lyric poetry;</a>
<a id='line_13'>      and his verse, or at least his name, is repeated by the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      enthusiasm, or affectation, of amorous sensibility. Whatever may</a>
<a id='line_15'>      be the private taste of a stranger, his slight and superficial</a>
<a id='line_16'>      knowledge should humbly acquiesce in the judgment of a learned</a>
<a id='line_17'>      nation; yet I may hope or presume, that the Italians do not</a>
<a id='line_18'>      compare the tedious uniformity of sonnets and elegies with the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      sublime compositions of their epic muse, the original wildness of</a>
<a id='line_20'>      Dante, the regular beauties of Tasso, and the boundless variety</a>
<a id='line_21'>      of the incomparable Ariosto. The merits of the lover I am still</a>
<a id='line_22'>      less qualified to appreciate: nor am I deeply interested in a</a>
<a id='line_23'>      metaphysical passion for a nymph so shadowy, that her existence</a>
<a id='line_24'>      has been questioned; 2 for a matron so prolific, 3 that she was</a>
<a id='line_25'>      delivered of eleven legitimate children, 4 while her amorous</a>
<a id='line_26'>      swain sighed and sung at the fountain of Vaucluse. 5 But in the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      eyes of Petrarch, and those of his graver contemporaries, his</a>
<a id='line_28'>      love was a sin, and Italian verse a frivolous amusement. His</a>
<a id='line_29'>      Latin works of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, established his</a>
<a id='line_30'>      serious reputation, which was soon diffused from Avignon over</a>
<a id='line_31'>      France and Italy: his friends and disciples were multiplied in</a>
<a id='line_32'>      every city; and if the ponderous volume of his writings 6 be now</a>
<a id='line_33'>      abandoned to a long repose, our gratitude must applaud the man,</a>
<a id='line_34'>      who by precept and example revived the spirit and study of the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Augustan age. From his earliest youth, Petrarch aspired to the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      poetic crown. The academical honors of the three faculties had</a>
<a id='line_37'>      introduced a royal degree of master or doctor in the art of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      poetry; 7 and the title of poet-laureate, which custom, rather</a>
<a id='line_39'>      than vanity, perpetuates in the English court, 8 was first</a>
<a id='line_40'>      invented by the Cæsars of Germany. In the musical games of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      antiquity, a prize was bestowed on the victor: 9 the belief that</a>
<a id='line_42'>      Virgil and Horace had been crowned in the Capitol inflamed the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      emulation of a Latin bard; 10 and the laurel 11 was endeared to</a>
<a id='line_44'>      the lover by a verbal resemblance with the name of his mistress.</a>
<a id='line_45'>      The value of either object was enhanced by the difficulties of</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the pursuit; and if the virtue or prudence of Laura was</a>
<a id='line_47'>      inexorable, 12 he enjoyed, and might boast of enjoying, the nymph</a>
<a id='line_48'>      of poetry. His vanity was not of the most delicate kind, since he</a>
<a id='line_49'>      applauds the success of his own _labors_; his name was popular;</a>
<a id='line_50'>      his friends were active; the open or secret opposition of envy</a>
<a id='line_51'>      and prejudice was surmounted by the dexterity of patient merit.</a>
<a id='line_52'>      In the thirty-sixth year of his age, he was solicited to accept</a>
<a id='line_53'>      the object of his wishes; and on the same day, in the solitude of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      Vaucluse, he received a similar and solemn invitation from the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      senate of Rome and the university of Paris. The learning of a</a>
<a id='line_56'>      theological school, and the ignorance of a lawless city, were</a>
<a id='line_57'>      alike unqualified to bestow the ideal though immortal wreath</a>
<a id='line_58'>      which genius may obtain from the free applause of the public and</a>
<a id='line_59'>      of posterity: but the candidate dismissed this troublesome</a>
<a id='line_60'>      reflection; and after some moments of complacency and suspense,</a>

<a id='line_158'>      Anguillara, a kinsman of the Colonna, assumed his throne; and at</a>

<a id='line_160'>      of Virgil, and thrice repeating his vows for the prosperity of</a>
<a id='line_161'>      Rome, he knelt before the throne, and received from the senator a</a>
<a id='line_162'>      laurel crown, with a more precious declaration, “This is the</a>
<a id='line_163'>      reward of merit.” The people shouted, “Long life to the Capitol</a>
<a id='line_164'>      and the poet!” A sonnet in praise of Rome was accepted as the</a>

<a id='line_175'>      of the senate and people; and the character of citizen was the</a>
<a id='line_176'>      recompense of his affection for the Roman name. They did him</a>
<a id='line_177'>      honor, but they did him justice. In the familiar society of</a>
<a id='line_178'>      Cicero and Livy, he had imbibed the ideas of an ancient patriot;</a>
<a id='line_179'>      and his ardent fancy kindled every idea to a sentiment, and every</a>
<a id='line_180'>      sentiment to a passion. The aspect of the seven hills and their</a>
<a id='line_181'>      majestic ruins confirmed these lively impressions; and he loved a</a>
<a id='line_182'>      country by whose liberal spirit he had been crowned and adopted.</a>
<a id='line_183'>      The poverty and debasement of Rome excited the indignation and</a>
<a id='line_184'>      pity of her grateful son; he dissembled the faults of his</a>
<a id='line_185'>      fellow-citizens; applauded with partial fondness the last of</a>
<a id='line_186'>      their heroes and matrons; and in the remembrance of the past, in</a>
<a id='line_187'>      the hopes of the future, was pleased to forget the miseries of</a>
<a id='line_188'>      the present time. Rome was still the lawful mistress of the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      world: the pope and the emperor, the bishop and general, had</a>
<a id='line_190'>      abdicated their station by an inglorious retreat to the Rhône and</a>
<a id='line_191'>      the Danube; but if she could resume her virtue, the republic</a>
<a id='line_192'>      might again vindicate her liberty and dominion. Amidst the</a>
<a id='line_193'>      indulgence of enthusiasm and eloquence, 15 Petrarch, Italy, and</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Europe, were astonished by a revolution which realized for a</a>

<a id='line_249'>      paints, without design or art, the manners of Rome and the</a>

<a id='line_252'>      have been brought to light in a life of Nicolas Rienzi,—Cola di</a>
<a id='line_253'>      Rienzo und seine Zeit,—by Dr. Felix Papencordt. The most</a>
<a id='line_254'>      important of these documents are letters from Rienzi to Charles</a>
<a id='line_255'>      the Fourth, emperor and king of Bohemia, and to the archbishop of</a>
<a id='line_256'>      Praque; they enter into the whole history of his adventurous</a>
<a id='line_257'>      career during its first period, and throw a strong light upon his</a>
<a id='line_258'>      extraordinary character. These documents were first discovered</a>
<a id='line_259'>      and made use of, to a certain extent, by Pelzel, the historian of</a>
<a id='line_260'>      Bohemia. The originals have disappeared, but a copy made by</a>
<a id='line_261'>      Pelzel for his own use is now in the library of Count Thun at</a>
<a id='line_262'>      Teschen. There seems no doubt of their authenticity. Dr.</a>
<a id='line_263'>      Papencordt has printed the whole in his Urkunden, with the</a>
<a id='line_264'>      exception of one long theological paper.—M. 1845.]</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>      In a quarter of the city which was inhabited only by mechanics</a>
<a id='line_267'>      and Jews, the marriage of an innkeeper and a washer woman</a>
<a id='line_268'>      produced the future deliverer of Rome. 20 201 From such parents</a>
<a id='line_269'>      Nicholas Rienzi Gabrini could inherit neither dignity nor</a>
<a id='line_270'>      fortune; and the gift of a liberal education, which they</a>
<a id='line_271'>      painfully bestowed, was the cause of his glory and untimely end.</a>
<a id='line_272'>      The study of history and eloquence, the writings of Cicero,</a>
<a id='line_273'>      Seneca, Livy, Cæsar, and Valerius Maximus, elevated above his</a>
<a id='line_274'>      equals and contemporaries the genius of the young plebeian: he</a>
<a id='line_275'>      perused with indefatigable diligence the manuscripts and marbles</a>
<a id='line_276'>      of antiquity; loved to dispense his knowledge in familiar</a>
<a id='line_277'>      language; and was often provoked to exclaim, “Where are now these</a>
<a id='line_278'>      Romans? their virtue, their justice, their power? why was I not</a>
<a id='line_279'>      born in those happy times?” 21 When the republic addressed to the</a>
<a id='line_280'>      throne of Avignon an embassy of the three orders, the spirit and</a>
<a id='line_281'>      eloquence of Rienzi recommended him to a place among the thirteen</a>
<a id='line_282'>      deputies of the commons. The orator had the honor of haranguing</a>
<a id='line_283'>      Pope Clement the Sixth, and the satisfaction of conversing with</a>
<a id='line_284'>      Petrarch, a congenial mind: but his aspiring hopes were chilled</a>
<a id='line_285'>      by disgrace and poverty and the patriot was reduced to a single</a>
<a id='line_286'>      garment and the charity of the hospital. 211 From this misery he</a>
<a id='line_287'>      was relieved by the sense of merit or the smile of favor; and the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      employment of apostolic notary afforded him a daily stipend of</a>
<a id='line_289'>      five gold florins, a more honorable and extensive connection, and</a>
<a id='line_290'>      the right of contrasting, both in words and actions, his own</a>
<a id='line_291'>      integrity with the vices of the state. The eloquence of Rienzi</a>
<a id='line_292'>      was prompt and persuasive: the multitude is always prone to envy</a>
<a id='line_293'>      and censure: he was stimulated by the loss of a brother and the</a>
<a id='line_294'>      impunity of the assassins; nor was it possible to excuse or</a>
<a id='line_295'>      exaggerate the public calamities. The blessings of peace and</a>
<a id='line_296'>      justice, for which civil society has been instituted, were</a>
<a id='line_297'>      banished from Rome: the jealous citizens, who might have endured</a>
<a id='line_298'>      every personal or pecuniary injury, were most deeply wounded in</a>
<a id='line_299'>      the dishonor of their wives and daughters: 22 they were equally</a>
<a id='line_300'>      oppressed by the arrogance of the nobles and the corruption of</a>
<a id='line_301'>      the magistrates; 221 and the abuse of arms or of laws was the</a>
<a id='line_302'>      only circumstance that distinguished the lions from the dogs and</a>
<a id='line_303'>      serpents of the Capitol. These allegorical emblems were variously</a>
<a id='line_304'>      repeated in the pictures which Rienzi exhibited in the streets</a>
<a id='line_305'>      and churches; and while the spectators gazed with curious wonder,</a>
<a id='line_306'>      the bold and ready orator unfolded the meaning, applied the</a>
<a id='line_307'>      satire, inflamed their passions, and announced a distant hope of</a>
<a id='line_308'>      comfort and deliverance. The privileges of Rome, her eternal</a>
<a id='line_309'>      sovereignty over her princes and provinces, was the theme of his</a>
<a id='line_310'>      public and private discourse; and a monument of servitude became</a>
<a id='line_311'>      in his hands a title and incentive of liberty. The decree of the</a>
<a id='line_312'>      senate, which granted the most ample prerogatives to the emperor</a>
<a id='line_313'>      Vespasian, had been inscribed on a copper plate still extant in</a>
<a id='line_314'>      the choir of the church of St. John Lateran. 23 A numerous</a>
<a id='line_315'>      assembly of nobles and plebeians was invited to this political</a>
<a id='line_316'>      lecture, and a convenient theatre was erected for their</a>
<a id='line_317'>      reception. The notary appeared in a magnificent and mysterious</a>
<a id='line_318'>      habit, explained the inscription by a version and commentary, 24</a>
<a id='line_319'>      and descanted with eloquence and zeal on the ancient glories of</a>
<a id='line_320'>      the senate and people, from whom all legal authority was derived.</a>
<a id='line_321'>      The supine ignorance of the nobles was incapable of discerning</a>
<a id='line_322'>      the serious tendency of such representations: they might</a>
<a id='line_323'>      sometimes chastise with words and blows the plebeian reformer;</a>
<a id='line_324'>      but he was often suffered in the Colonna palace to amuse the</a>
<a id='line_325'>      company with his threats and predictions; and the modern Brutus</a>
<a id='line_326'>      25 was concealed under the mask of folly and the character of a</a>
<a id='line_327'>      buffoon. While they indulged their contempt, the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_328'>      the _good estate_, his favorite expression, was entertained among</a>
<a id='line_329'>      the people as a desirable, a possible, and at length as an</a>
<a id='line_330'>      approaching, event; and while all had the disposition to applaud,</a>

<a id='line_398'>      A prophecy, or rather a summons, affixed on the church door of</a>
<a id='line_399'>      St. George, was the first public evidence of his designs; a</a>
<a id='line_400'>      nocturnal assembly of a hundred citizens on Mount Aventine, the</a>
<a id='line_401'>      first step to their execution. After an oath of secrecy and aid,</a>
<a id='line_402'>      he represented to the conspirators the importance and facility of</a>
<a id='line_403'>      their enterprise; that the nobles, without union or resources,</a>
<a id='line_404'>      were strong only in the fear nobles, of their imaginary strength;</a>
<a id='line_405'>      that all power, as well as right, was in the hands of the people;</a>
<a id='line_406'>      that the revenues of the apostolical chamber might relieve the</a>
<a id='line_407'>      public distress; and that the pope himself would approve their</a>
<a id='line_408'>      victory over the common enemies of government and freedom. After</a>
<a id='line_409'>      securing a faithful band to protect his first declaration, he</a>
<a id='line_410'>      proclaimed through the city, by sound of trumpet, that on the</a>
<a id='line_411'>      evening of the following day, all persons should assemble without</a>
<a id='line_412'>      arms before the church of St. Angelo, to provide for the</a>
<a id='line_413'>      reestablishment of the good estate. The whole night was employed</a>
<a id='line_414'>      in the celebration of thirty masses of the Holy Ghost; and in the</a>
<a id='line_415'>      morning, Rienzi, bareheaded, but in complete armor, issued from</a>
<a id='line_416'>      the church, encompassed by the hundred conspirators. The pope’s</a>
<a id='line_417'>      vicar, the simple bishop of Orvieto, who had been persuaded to</a>
<a id='line_418'>      sustain a part in this singular ceremony, marched on his right</a>
<a id='line_419'>      hand; and three great standards were borne aloft as the emblems</a>
<a id='line_420'>      of their design. In the first, the banner of _liberty_, Rome was</a>
<a id='line_421'>      seated on two lions, with a palm in one hand and a globe in the</a>
<a id='line_422'>      other; St. Paul, with a drawn sword, was delineated in the banner</a>
<a id='line_423'>      of _justice_; and in the third, St. Peter held the keys of</a>
<a id='line_424'>      _concord_ and _peace_. Rienzi was encouraged by the presence and</a>
<a id='line_425'>      applause of an innumerable crowd, who understood little, and</a>
<a id='line_426'>      hoped much; and the procession slowly rolled forwards from the</a>
<a id='line_427'>      castle of St. Angelo to the Capitol. His triumph was disturbed by</a>
<a id='line_428'>      some secret emotions which he labored to suppress: he ascended</a>
<a id='line_429'>      without opposition, and with seeming confidence, the citadel of</a>
<a id='line_430'>      the republic; harangued the people from the balcony; and received</a>
<a id='line_431'>      the most flattering confirmation of his acts and laws. The</a>
<a id='line_432'>      nobles, as if destitute of arms and counsels, beheld in silent</a>
<a id='line_433'>      consternation this strange revolution; and the moment had been</a>
<a id='line_434'>      prudently chosen, when the most formidable, Stephen Colonna, was</a>
<a id='line_435'>      absent from the city. On the first rumor, he returned to his</a>
<a id='line_436'>      palace, affected to despise this plebeian tumult, and declared to</a>
<a id='line_437'>      the messenger of Rienzi, that at his leisure he would cast the</a>
<a id='line_438'>      madman from the windows of the Capitol. The great bell instantly</a>
<a id='line_439'>      rang an alarm, and so rapid was the tide, so urgent was the</a>
<a id='line_440'>      danger, that Colonna escaped with precipitation to the suburb of</a>
<a id='line_441'>      St. Laurence: from thence, after a moment’s refreshment, he</a>
<a id='line_442'>      continued the same speedy career till he reached in safety his</a>
<a id='line_443'>      castle of Palestrina; lamenting his own imprudence, which had not</a>
<a id='line_444'>      trampled the spark of this mighty conflagration. A general and</a>
<a id='line_445'>      peremptory order was issued from the Capitol to all the nobles,</a>
<a id='line_446'>      that they should peaceably retire to their estates: they obeyed;</a>
<a id='line_447'>      and their departure secured the tranquillity of the free and</a>
<a id='line_448'>      obedient citizens of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_449'></a>
<a id='line_450'>      But such voluntary obedience evaporates with the first transports</a>
<a id='line_451'>      of zeal; and Rienzi felt the importance of justifying his</a>
<a id='line_452'>      usurpation by a regular form and a legal title. At his own</a>
<a id='line_453'>      choice, the Roman people would have displayed their attachment</a>
<a id='line_454'>      and authority, by lavishing on his head the names of senator or</a>
<a id='line_455'>      consul, of king or emperor: he preferred the ancient and modest</a>
<a id='line_456'>      appellation of tribune; 251 the protection of the commons was the</a>
<a id='line_457'>      essence of that sacred office; and they were ignorant, that it</a>
<a id='line_458'>      had never been invested with any share in the legislative or</a>
<a id='line_459'>      executive powers of the republic. In this character, and with the</a>
<a id='line_460'>      consent of the Roman, the tribune enacted the most salutary laws</a>
<a id='line_461'>      for the restoration and maintenance of the good estate. By the</a>
<a id='line_462'>      first he fulfils the wish of honesty and inexperience, that no</a>
<a id='line_463'>      civil suit should be protracted beyond the term of fifteen days.</a>
<a id='line_464'>      The danger of frequent perjury might justify the pronouncing</a>
<a id='line_465'>      against a false accuser the same penalty which his evidence would</a>
<a id='line_466'>      have inflicted: the disorders of the times might compel the</a>
<a id='line_467'>      legislator to punish every homicide with death, and every injury</a>
<a id='line_468'>      with equal retaliation. But the execution of justice was hopeless</a>
<a id='line_469'>      till he had previously abolished the tyranny of the nobles. It</a>
<a id='line_470'>      was formally provided, that none, except the supreme magistrate,</a>
<a id='line_471'>      should possess or command the gates, bridges, or towers of the</a>
<a id='line_472'>      state; that no private garrisons should be introduced into the</a>
<a id='line_473'>      towns or castles of the Roman territory; that none should bear</a>
<a id='line_474'>      arms, or presume to fortify their houses in the city or country;</a>
<a id='line_475'>      that the barons should be responsible for the safety of the</a>
<a id='line_476'>      highways, and the free passage of provisions; and that the</a>
<a id='line_477'>      protection of malefactors and robbers should be expiated by a</a>
<a id='line_478'>      fine of a thousand marks of silver. But these regulations would</a>
<a id='line_479'>      have been impotent and nugatory, had not the licentious nobles</a>
<a id='line_480'>      been awed by the sword of the civil power. A sudden alarm from</a>
<a id='line_481'>      the bell of the Capitol could still summon to the standard above</a>
<a id='line_482'>      twenty thousand volunteers: the support of the tribune and the</a>
<a id='line_483'>      laws required a more regular and permanent force. In each harbor</a>
<a id='line_484'>      of the coast a vessel was stationed for the assurance of</a>
<a id='line_485'>      commerce; a standing militia of three hundred and sixty horse and</a>
<a id='line_486'>      thirteen hundred foot was levied, clothed, and paid in the</a>
<a id='line_487'>      thirteen quarters of the city: and the spirit of a commonwealth</a>
<a id='line_488'>      may be traced in the grateful allowance of one hundred florins,</a>
<a id='line_489'>      or pounds, to the heirs of every soldier who lost his life in the</a>
<a id='line_490'>      service of his country. For the maintenance of the public</a>
<a id='line_491'>      defence, for the establishment of granaries, for the relief of</a>
<a id='line_492'>      widows, orphans, and indigent convents, Rienzi applied, without</a>
<a id='line_493'>      fear of sacrilege, the revenues of the apostolic chamber: the</a>
<a id='line_494'>      three branches of hearth-money, the salt-duty, and the customs,</a>
<a id='line_495'>      were each of the annual produce of one hundred thousand florins;</a>
<a id='line_496'>      26 and scandalous were the abuses, if in four or five months the</a>
<a id='line_497'>      amount of the salt-duty could be trebled by his judicious</a>
<a id='line_498'>      economy. After thus restoring the forces and finances of the</a>
<a id='line_499'>      republic, the tribune recalled the nobles from their solitary</a>
<a id='line_500'>      independence; required their personal appearance in the Capitol;</a>
<a id='line_501'>      and imposed an oath of allegiance to the new government, and of</a>
<a id='line_502'>      submission to the laws of the good estate. Apprehensive for their</a>
<a id='line_503'>      safety, but still more apprehensive of the danger of a refusal,</a>
<a id='line_504'>      the princes and barons returned to their houses at Rome in the</a>
<a id='line_505'>      garb of simple and peaceful citizens: the Colonna and Ursini, the</a>
<a id='line_506'>      Savelli and Frangipani, were confounded before the tribunal of a</a>
<a id='line_507'>      plebeian, of the vile buffoon whom they had so often derided, and</a>
<a id='line_508'>      their disgrace was aggravated by the indignation which they</a>
<a id='line_509'>      vainly struggled to disguise. The same oath was successively</a>
<a id='line_510'>      pronounced by the several orders of society, the clergy and</a>
<a id='line_511'>      gentlemen, the judges and notaries, the merchants and artisans,</a>
<a id='line_512'>      and the gradual descent was marked by the increase of sincerity</a>
<a id='line_513'>      and zeal. They swore to live and die with the republic and the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      church, whose interest was artfully united by the nominal</a>
<a id='line_515'>      association of the bishop of Orvieto, the pope’s vicar, to the</a>
<a id='line_516'>      office of tribune. It was the boast of Rienzi, that he had</a>
<a id='line_517'>      delivered the throne and patrimony of St. Peter from a rebellious</a>
<a id='line_518'>      aristocracy; and Clement the Sixth, who rejoiced in its fall,</a>
<a id='line_519'>      affected to believe the professions, to applaud the merits, and</a>
<a id='line_520'>      to confirm the title, of his trusty servant. The speech, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_521'>      the mind, of the tribune, was inspired with a lively regard for</a>
<a id='line_522'>      the purity of the faith: he insinuated his claim to a</a>
<a id='line_523'>      supernatural mission from the Holy Ghost; enforced by a heavy</a>
<a id='line_524'>      forfeiture the annual duty of confession and communion; and</a>

<a id='line_564'>      in Rome, on which no officer of justice would presume to</a>
<a id='line_565'>      trespass, were abolished; and he applied the timber and iron of</a>

<a id='line_569'>      protect a criminal. A mule, with a jar of oil, had been stolen</a>
<a id='line_570'>      near Capranica; and the lord of the Ursini family was condemned</a>
<a id='line_571'>      to restore the damage, and to discharge a fine of four hundred</a>
<a id='line_572'>      florins for his negligence in guarding the highways. Nor were the</a>

<a id='line_574'>      and, either from accident or design, the same impartial rigor was</a>
<a id='line_575'>      exercised against the heads of the adverse factions. Peter Agapet</a>

<a id='line_578'>      tardy execution of Martin Ursini, who, among his various acts of</a>
<a id='line_579'>      violence and rapine, had pillaged a shipwrecked vessel at the</a>
<a id='line_580'>      mouth of the Tyber. 28 His name, the purple of two cardinals, his</a>
<a id='line_581'>      uncles, a recent marriage, and a mortal disease were disregarded</a>
<a id='line_582'>      by the inflexible tribune, who had chosen his victim. The public</a>

<a id='line_584'>      was short and satisfactory: the bell of the Capitol convened the</a>
<a id='line_585'>      people: stripped of his mantle, on his knees, with his hands</a>
<a id='line_586'>      bound behind his back, he heard the sentence of death; and after</a>
<a id='line_587'>      a brief confession, Ursini was led away to the gallows. After</a>
<a id='line_588'>      such an example, none who were conscious of guilt could hope for</a>
<a id='line_589'>      impunity, and the flight of the wicked, the licentious, and the</a>

<a id='line_607'>      were of Naples and the Isle of naria less skilful than those of</a>

<a id='line_620'>      and the free cities and princes the members and associates. His</a>
<a id='line_621'>      pen was not less eloquent than his tongue; and his numerous</a>
<a id='line_622'>      epistles were delivered to swift and trusty messengers. On foot,</a>
<a id='line_623'>      with a white wand in their hand, they traversed the forests and</a>
<a id='line_624'>      mountains; enjoyed, in the most hostile states, the sacred</a>
<a id='line_625'>      security of ambassadors; and reported, in the style of flattery</a>
<a id='line_626'>      or truth, that the highways along their passage were lined with</a>
<a id='line_627'>      kneeling multitudes, who implored Heaven for the success of their</a>
<a id='line_628'>      undertaking. Could passion have listened to reason; could private</a>

<a id='line_630'>      and confederate union of the Italian republic might have healed</a>
<a id='line_631'>      their intestine discord, and closed the Alps against the</a>

<a id='line_633'>      and if Venice, Florence, Sienna, Perugia, and many inferior</a>
<a id='line_634'>      cities offered their lives and fortunes to the good estate, the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      tyrants of Lombardy and Tuscany must despise, or hate, the</a>
<a id='line_636'>      plebeian author of a free constitution. From them, however, and</a>
<a id='line_637'>      from every part of Italy, the tribune received the most friendly</a>

<a id='line_648'>      soon determined by the sword of the Hungarian. Beyond the Alps,</a>

<a id='line_804'>      Rienzi excite such scandal and censure as by the profane use of</a>
<a id='line_805'>      the porphyry vase, in which Constantine (a foolish legend) had</a>

<a id='line_811'>      majestic attitude, with a robe of purple, his sword, and gilt</a>
<a id='line_812'>      spurs; but the holy rites were soon interrupted by his levity and</a>
<a id='line_813'>      insolence. Rising from his throne, and advancing towards the</a>
<a id='line_814'>      congregation, he proclaimed in a loud voice: “We summon to our</a>
<a id='line_815'>      tribunal Pope Clement: and command him to reside in his diocese</a>
<a id='line_816'>      of Rome: we also summon the sacred college of cardinals. 38 We</a>

<a id='line_820'>      usurped the inalienable right of the Roman people, the ancient</a>
<a id='line_821'>      and lawful sovereigns of the empire.” 39 Unsheathing his maiden</a>
<a id='line_822'>      sword, he thrice brandished it to the three parts of the world,</a>
<a id='line_823'>      and thrice repeated the extravagant declaration, “And this too is</a>
<a id='line_824'>      mine!” The pope’s vicar, the bishop of Orvieto, attempted to</a>
<a id='line_825'>      check this career of folly; but his feeble protest was silenced</a>
<a id='line_826'>      by martial music; and instead of withdrawing from the assembly,</a>
<a id='line_827'>      he consented to dine with his brother tribune, at a table which</a>
<a id='line_828'>      had hitherto been reserved for the supreme pontiff. A banquet,</a>
<a id='line_829'>      such as the Cæsars had given, was prepared for the Romans. The</a>
<a id='line_830'>      apartments, porticos, and courts of the Lateran were spread with</a>
<a id='line_831'>      innumerable tables for either sex, and every condition; a stream</a>
<a id='line_832'>      of wine flowed from the nostrils of Constantine’s brazen horse;</a>
<a id='line_833'>      no complaint, except of the scarcity of water, could be heard;</a>
<a id='line_834'>      and the licentiousness of the multitude was curbed by discipline</a>
<a id='line_835'>      and fear. A subsequent day was appointed for the coronation of</a>
<a id='line_836'>      Rienzi; 40 seven crowns of different leaves or metals were</a>
<a id='line_837'>      successively placed on his head by the most eminent of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_838'>      clergy; they represented the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost; and</a>
<a id='line_839'>      he still professed to imitate the example of the ancient</a>

<a id='line_841'>      flatter the people; and their own vanity was gratified in the</a>
<a id='line_842'>      vanity of their leader. But in his private life he soon deviated</a>
<a id='line_843'>      from the strict rule of frugality and abstinence; and the</a>
<a id='line_844'>      plebeians, who were awed by the splendor of the nobles, were</a>
<a id='line_845'>      provoked by the luxury of their equal. His wife, his son, his</a>

<a id='line_905'>      presence of the tribune; and they trembled, good God, how they</a>
<a id='line_906'>      trembled!” 41 As long as the yoke of Rienzi was that of justice</a>
<a id='line_907'>      and their country, their conscience forced them to esteem the</a>
<a id='line_908'>      man, whom pride and interest provoked them to hate: his</a>
<a id='line_909'>      extravagant conduct soon fortified their hatred by contempt; and</a>
<a id='line_910'>      they conceived the hope of subverting a power which was no longer</a>
<a id='line_911'>      so deeply rooted in the public confidence. The old animosity of</a>
<a id='line_912'>      the Colonna and Ursini was suspended for a moment by their common</a>

<a id='line_914'>      designs; an assassin was seized and tortured; he accused the</a>
<a id='line_915'>      nobles; and as soon as Rienzi deserved the fate, he adopted the</a>
<a id='line_916'>      suspicions and maxims, of a tyrant. On the same day, under</a>
<a id='line_917'>      various pretences, he invited to the Capitol his principal</a>
<a id='line_918'>      enemies, among whom were five members of the Ursini and three of</a>

<a id='line_923'>      the great bell the people assembled; they were arraigned for a</a>
<a id='line_924'>      conspiracy against the tribune’s life; and though some might</a>
<a id='line_925'>      sympathize in their distress, not a hand, nor a voice, was raised</a>
<a id='line_926'>      to rescue the first of the nobility from their impending doom.</a>
<a id='line_927'>      Their apparent boldness was prompted by despair; they passed in</a>
<a id='line_928'>      separate chambers a sleepless and painful night; and the</a>
<a id='line_929'>      venerable hero, Stephen Colonna, striking against the door of his</a>
<a id='line_930'>      prison, repeatedly urged his guards to deliver him by a speedy</a>
<a id='line_931'>      death from such ignominious servitude. In the morning they</a>
<a id='line_932'>      understood their sentence from the visit of a confessor and the</a>
<a id='line_933'>      tolling of the bell. The great hall of the Capitol had been</a>
<a id='line_934'>      decorated for the bloody scene with red and white hangings: the</a>
<a id='line_935'>      countenance of the tribune was dark and severe; the swords of the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      executioners were unsheathed; and the barons were interrupted in</a>
<a id='line_937'>      their dying speeches by the sound of trumpets. But in this</a>
<a id='line_938'>      decisive moment, Rienzi was not less anxious or apprehensive than</a>
<a id='line_939'>      his captives: he dreaded the splendor of their names, their</a>
<a id='line_940'>      surviving kinsmen, the inconstancy of the people, the reproaches</a>
<a id='line_941'>      of the world, and, after rashly offering a mortal injury, he</a>
<a id='line_942'>      vainly presumed that, if he could forgive, he might himself be</a>
<a id='line_943'>      forgiven. His elaborate oration was that of a Christian and a</a>
<a id='line_944'>      suppliant; and, as the humble minister of the commons, he</a>
<a id='line_945'>      entreated his masters to pardon these noble criminals, for whose</a>
<a id='line_946'>      repentance and future service he pledged his faith and authority.</a>
<a id='line_947'>      “If you are spared,” said the tribune, “by the mercy of the</a>

<a id='line_1240'>      despair. The tribune had reigned with absolute dominion, by the</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      choice, and in the hearts, of the Romans: the senator was the</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      servile minister of a foreign court; and while he was suspected</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      by the people, he was abandoned by the prince. The legate</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      Albornoz, who seemed desirous of his ruin, inflexibly refused all</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      supplies of men and money; a faithful subject could no longer</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      presume to touch the revenues of the apostolical chamber; and the</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      first idea of a tax was the signal of clamor and sedition. Even</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      his justice was tainted with the guilt or reproach of selfish</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      cruelty: the most virtuous citizen of Rome was sacrificed to his</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      jealousy; and in the execution of a public robber, from whose</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      purse he had been assisted, the magistrate too much forgot, or</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      too much remembered, the obligations of the debtor. 54 A civil</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      war exhausted his treasures, and the patience of the city: the</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      Colonna maintained their hostile station at Palestrina; and his</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      mercenaries soon despised a leader whose ignorance and fear were</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      envious of all subordinate merit. In the death, as in the life,</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      of Rienzi, the hero and the coward were strangely mingled. When</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      the Capitol was invested by a furious multitude, when he was</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      basely deserted by his civil and military servants, the intrepid</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      senator, waving the banner of liberty, presented himself on the</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      balcony, addressed his eloquence to the various passions of the</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      Romans, and labored to persuade them, that in the same cause</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      himself and the republic must either stand or fall. His oration</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      was interrupted by a volley of imprecations and stones; and after</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      an arrow had transpierced his hand, he sunk into abject despair,</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      and fled weeping to the inner chambers, from whence he was let</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      down by a sheet before the windows of the prison. Destitute of</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      aid or hope, he was besieged till the evening: the doors of the</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      Capitol were destroyed with axes and fire; and while the senator</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      attempted to escape in a plebeian habit, he was discovered and</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      dragged to the platform of the palace, the fatal scene of his</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      judgments and executions. A whole hour, without voice or motion,</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      he stood amidst the multitude half naked and half dead: their</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      rage was hushed into curiosity and wonder: the last feelings of</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      reverence and compassion yet struggled in his favor; and they</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      might have prevailed, if a bold assassin had not plunged a dagger</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      in his breast. He fell senseless with the first stroke: the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      impotent revenge of his enemies inflicted a thousand wounds: and</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      the senator’s body was abandoned to the dogs, to the Jews, and to</a>

<a id='line_1334'>      of youth, with the authority of age, Petrarch addressed his</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      exhortations to five successive popes, and his eloquence was</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      always inspired by the enthusiasm of sentiment and the freedom of</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      language. 57 The son of a citizen of Florence invariably</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      preferred the country of his birth to that of his education; and</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      Italy, in his eyes, was the queen and garden of the world. Amidst</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      her domestic factions, she was doubtless superior to France both</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      in art and science, in wealth and politeness; but the difference</a>

<a id='line_1348'>      papal court. He confesses that the successor of St. Peter is the</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      bishop of the universal church; yet it was not on the banks of</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      the Rhône, but of the Tyber, that the apostle had fixed his</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      everlasting throne; and while every city in the Christian world</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      was blessed with a bishop, the metropolis alone was desolate and</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      forlorn. Since the removal of the Holy See, the sacred buildings</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      of the Lateran and the Vatican, their altars and their saints,</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      were left in a state of poverty and decay; and Rome was often</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      painted under the image of a disconsolate matron, as if the</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      wandering husband could be reclaimed by the homely portrait of</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      the age and infirmities of his weeping spouse. 58 But the cloud</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      which hung over the seven hills would be dispelled by the</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      presence of their lawful sovereign: eternal fame, the prosperity</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      of Rome, and the peace of Italy, would be the recompense of the</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      pope who should dare to embrace this generous resolution. Of the</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      five whom Petrarch exhorted, the three first, John the</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      Twenty-second, Benedict the Twelfth, and Clement the Sixth, were</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      importuned or amused by the boldness of the orator; but the</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      memorable change which had been attempted by Urban the Fifth was</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      finally accomplished by Gregory the Eleventh. The execution of</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      their design was opposed by weighty and almost insuperable</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      obstacles. A king of France, who has deserved the epithet of</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      wise, was unwilling to release them from a local dependence: the</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      cardinals, for the most part his subjects, were attached to the</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      language, manners, and climate of Avignon; to their stately</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      palaces; above all, to the wines of Burgundy. In their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      Italy was foreign or hostile; and they reluctantly embarked at</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      Marseilles, as if they had been sold or banished into the land of</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      the Saracens. Urban the Fifth resided three years in the Vatican</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      with safety and honor: his sanctity was protected by a guard of</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      two thousand horse; and the king of Cyprus, the queen of Naples,</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      and the emperors of the East and West, devoutly saluted their</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      common father in the chair of St. Peter. But the joy of Petrarch</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      and the Italians was soon turned into grief and indignation. Some</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      reasons of public or private moment, his own impatience or the</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      prayers of the cardinals, recalled Urban to France; and the</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      approaching election was saved from the tyrannic patriotism of</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      the Romans. The powers of heaven were interested in their cause:</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      Bridget of Sweden, a saint and pilgrim, disapproved the return,</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      and foretold the death, of Urban the Fifth: the migration of</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      Gregory the Eleventh was encouraged by St. Catharine of Sienna,</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      the spouse of Christ and ambassadress of the Florentines; and the</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      popes themselves, the great masters of human credulity, appear to</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      have listened to these visionary females. 59 Yet those celestial</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      admonitions were supported by some arguments of temporal policy.</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      The residents of Avignon had been invaded by hostile violence: at</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      the head of thirty thousand robbers, a hero had extorted ransom</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      and absolution from the vicar of Christ and the sacred college;</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      and the maxim of the French warriors, to spare the people and</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      plunder the church, was a new heresy of the most dangerous</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      import. 60 While the pope was driven from Avignon, he was</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      strenuously invited to Rome. The senate and people acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      him as their lawful sovereign, and laid at his feet the keys of</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      the gates, the bridges, and the fortresses; of the quarter at</a>

<a id='line_1478'>      frown on a measure of such apparent season and propriety. Gregory</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      the Eleventh did not survive above fourteen months his return to</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      the Vatican; and his decease was followed by the great schism of</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      the West, which distracted the Latin church above forty years.</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      The sacred college was then composed of twenty-two cardinals: six</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      of these had remained at Avignon; eleven Frenchmen, one Spaniard,</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      and four Italians, entered the conclave in the usual form. Their</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      choice was not yet limited to the purple; and their unanimous</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      votes acquiesced in the archbishop of Bari, a subject of Naples,</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      conspicuous for his zeal and learning, who ascended the throne of</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      St. Peter under the name of Urban the Sixth. The epistle of the</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      sacred college affirms his free, and regular, election; which had</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      been inspired, as usual, by the Holy Ghost; he was adored,</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      invested, and crowned, with the customary rites; his temporal</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      authority was obeyed at Rome and Avignon, and his ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      supremacy was acknowledged in the Latin world. During several</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      weeks, the cardinals attended their new master with the fairest</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      professions of attachment and loyalty; till the summer heats</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      permitted a decent escape from the city. But as soon as they were</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      united at Anagni and Fundi, in a place of security, they cast</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      aside the mask, accused their own falsehood and hypocrisy,</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      excommunicated the apostate and antichrist of Rome, and proceeded</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      to a new election of Robert of Geneva, Clement the Seventh, whom</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      they announced to the nations as the true and rightful vicar of</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      Christ. Their first choice, an involuntary and illegal act, was</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      annulled by fear of death and the menaces of the Romans; and</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      their complaint is justified by the strong evidence of</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      probability and fact. The twelve French cardinals, above two</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      thirds of the votes, were masters of the election; and whatever</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      might be their provincial jealousies, it cannot fairly be</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      presumed that they would have sacrificed their right and interest</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      to a foreign candidate, who would never restore them to their</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      native country. In the various, and often inconsistent,</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      narratives, 66 the shades of popular violence are more darkly or</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      faintly colored: but the licentiousness of the seditious Romans</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      was inflamed by a sense of their privileges, and the danger of a</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      second emigration. The conclave was intimidated by the shouts,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      and encompassed by the arms, of thirty thousand rebels; the bells</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      of the Capitol and St. Peter’s rang an alarm: “Death, or an</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      Italian pope!” was the universal cry; the same threat was</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      repeated by the twelve bannerets or chiefs of the quarters, in</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      the form of charitable advice; some preparations were made for</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      burning the obstinate cardinals; and had they chosen a</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      Transalpine subject, it is probable that they would never have</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      departed alive from the Vatican. The same constraint imposed the</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      necessity of dissembling in the eyes of Rome and of the world;</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      the pride and cruelty of Urban presented a more inevitable</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      danger; and they soon discovered the features of the tyrant, who</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      could walk in his garden and recite his breviary, while he heard</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      from an adjacent chamber six cardinals groaning on the rack. His</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      inflexible zeal, which loudly censured their luxury and vice,</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      would have attached them to the stations and duties of their</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      parishes at Rome; and had he not fatally delayed a new promotion,</a>

<a id='line_1816'>      patriots regretted the dominion of the church; and their</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      repentance was unanimous and effectual. The troops of St. Peter</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      again occupied the Capitol; the magistrates departed to their</a>

<a id='line_1967'>      and he aspired, beyond the aim of vulgar ambition, to free his</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      country and immortalize his name. The dominion of priests is most</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      odious to a liberal spirit: every scruple was removed by the</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      recent knowledge of the fable and forgery of Constantine’s</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      donation; Petrarch was now the oracle of the Italians; and as</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      often as Porcaro revolved the ode which describes the patriot and</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      hero of Rome, he applied to himself the visions of the prophetic</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      bard. His first trial of the popular feelings was at the funeral</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      of Eugenius the Fourth: in an elaborate speech he called the</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      Romans to liberty and arms; and they listened with apparent</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      pleasure, till Porcaro was interrupted and answered by a grave</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      advocate, who pleaded for the church and state. By every law the</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      seditious orator was guilty of treason; but the benevolence of</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      the new pontiff, who viewed his character with pity and esteem,</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      attempted by an honorable office to convert the patriot into a</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      friend. The inflexible Roman returned from Anagni with an</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      increase of reputation and zeal; and, on the first opportunity,</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      the games of the place Navona, he tried to inflame the casual</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      dispute of some boys and mechanics into a general rising of the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      people. Yet the humane Nicholas was still averse to accept the</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      forfeit of his life; and the traitor was removed from the scene</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      of temptation to Bologna, with a liberal allowance for his</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      support, and the easy obligation of presenting himself each day</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      before the governor of the city. But Porcaro had learned from the</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      younger Brutus, that with tyrants no faith or gratitude should be</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      observed: the exile declaimed against the arbitrary sentence; a</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      party and a conspiracy were gradually formed: his nephew, a</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      daring youth, assembled a band of volunteers; and on the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      appointed evening a feast was prepared at his house for the</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      friends of the republic. Their leader, who had escaped from</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      Bologna, appeared among them in a robe of purple and gold: his</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      voice, his countenance, his gestures, bespoke the man who had</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      devoted his life or death to the glorious cause. In a studied</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      oration, he expiated on the motives and the means of their</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      enterprise; the name and liberties of Rome; the sloth and pride</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      of their ecclesiastical tyrants; the active or passive consent of</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      their fellow-citizens; three hundred soldiers, and four hundred</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      exiles, long exercised in arms or in wrongs; the license of</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      revenge to edge their swords, and a million of ducats to reward</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      their victory. It would be easy, (he said,) on the next day, the</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      festival of the Epiphany, to seize the pope and his cardinals,</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      before the doors, or at the altar, of St. Peter’s; to lead them</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      in chains under the walls of St. Angelo; to extort by the threat</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      of their instant death a surrender of the castle; to ascend the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      vacant Capitol; to ring the alarm bell; and to restore in a</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      popular assembly the ancient republic of Rome. While he</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      triumphed, he was already betrayed. The senator, with a strong</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      guard, invested the house: the nephew of Porcaro cut his way</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      through the crowd; but the unfortunate Stephen was drawn from a</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      chest, lamenting that his enemies had anticipated by three hours</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      the execution of his design. After such manifest and repeated</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      guilt, even the mercy of Nicholas was silent. Porcaro, and nine</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      of his accomplices, were hanged without the benefit of the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      sacraments; and, amidst the fears and invectives of the papal</a>

<a id='line_2102'>      wrestle with the adjacent princes and states, whose military</a>

<a id='line_2105'>      arms for the dominion of Italy, they supplied with art the</a>

<a id='line_2107'>      treaties, their aspiring views, and the immortal hope of chasing</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      the Barbarians beyond the Alps. The nice balance of the Vatican</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      was often subverted by the soldiers of the North and West, who</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      were united under the standard of Charles the Fifth: the feeble</a>

<a id='line_2113'>      months to a lawless army, more cruel and rapacious than the Goths</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      and Vandals. 90 After this severe lesson, the popes contracted</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      their ambition, which was almost satisfied, resumed the character</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      of a common parent, and abstained from all offensive hostilities,</a>

<a id='line_2122'>      it became their interest to maintain the peace and dependence of</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      Italy, which continued almost without disturbance from the middle</a>

<a id='line_2125'>      Vatican was swayed and protected by the religious policy of the</a>

<a id='line_2221'>      abuses revived; the treasure was dissipated; he entailed on</a>
