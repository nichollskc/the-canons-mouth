<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     Public Sale Of The Empire To Didius Julianus By The Prætorian</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Guards—Clodius Albinus In Britain, Pescennius Niger In Syria, And</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Septimius Severus In Pannonia, Declare Against The Murderers Of</a>
<a id='line_5'>     Pertinax—Civil Wars And Victory Of Severus Over His Three</a>
<a id='line_6'>     Rivals—Relaxation Of Discipline—New Maxims Of Government.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      The power of the sword is more sensibly felt in an extensive</a>
<a id='line_9'>      monarchy, than in a small community. It has been calculated by</a>
<a id='line_10'>      the ablest politicians, that no state, without being soon</a>
<a id='line_11'>      exhausted, can maintain above the hundredth part of its members</a>
<a id='line_12'>      in arms and idleness. But although this relative proportion may</a>
<a id='line_13'>      be uniform, the influence of the army over the rest of the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      society will vary according to the degree of its positive</a>
<a id='line_15'>      strength. The advantages of military science and discipline</a>
<a id='line_16'>      cannot be exerted, unless a proper number of soldiers are united</a>
<a id='line_17'>      into one body, and actuated by one soul. With a handful of men,</a>
<a id='line_18'>      such a union would be ineffectual; with an unwieldy host, it</a>
<a id='line_19'>      would be impracticable; and the powers of the machine would be</a>
<a id='line_20'>      alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness or the excessive weight</a>
<a id='line_21'>      of its springs. To illustrate this observation, we need only</a>
<a id='line_22'>      reflect, that there is no superiority of natural strength,</a>
<a id='line_23'>      artificial weapons, or acquired skill, which could enable one man</a>
<a id='line_24'>      to keep in constant subjection one hundred of his</a>
<a id='line_25'>      fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a single town, or a small</a>
<a id='line_26'>      district, would soon discover that a hundred armed followers were</a>
<a id='line_27'>      a weak defence against ten thousand peasants or citizens; but a</a>
<a id='line_28'>      hundred thousand well-disciplined soldiers will command, with</a>
<a id='line_29'>      despotic sway, ten millions of subjects; and a body of ten or</a>
<a id='line_30'>      fifteen thousand guards will strike terror into the most numerous</a>
<a id='line_31'>      populace that ever crowded the streets of an immense capital.</a>
<a id='line_32'></a>
<a id='line_33'>      The Prætorian bands, whose licentious fury was the first symptom</a>
<a id='line_34'>      and cause of the decline of the Roman empire, scarcely amounted</a>
<a id='line_35'>      to the last-mentioned number. 1 They derived their institution</a>
<a id='line_36'>      from Augustus. That crafty tyrant, sensible that laws might</a>
<a id='line_37'>      color, but that arms alone could maintain, his usurped dominion,</a>
<a id='line_38'>      had gradually formed this powerful body of guards, in constant</a>
<a id='line_39'>      readiness to protect his person, to awe the senate, and either to</a>
<a id='line_40'>      prevent or to crush the first motions of rebellion. He</a>
<a id='line_41'>      distinguished these favored troops by a double pay and superior</a>
<a id='line_42'>      privileges; but, as their formidable aspect would at once have</a>
<a id='line_43'>      alarmed and irritated the Roman people, three cohorts only were</a>
<a id='line_44'>      stationed in the capital, whilst the remainder was dispersed in</a>
<a id='line_45'>      the adjacent towns of Italy. 2 But after fifty years of peace and</a>
<a id='line_46'>      servitude, Tiberius ventured on a decisive measure, which forever</a>
<a id='line_47'>      rivetted the fetters of his country. Under the fair pretences of</a>
<a id='line_48'>      relieving Italy from the heavy burden of military quarters, and</a>
<a id='line_49'>      of introducing a stricter discipline among the guards, he</a>
<a id='line_50'>      assembled them at Rome, in a permanent camp, 3 which was</a>
<a id='line_51'>      fortified with skilful care, 4 and placed on a commanding</a>
<a id='line_52'>      situation. 5</a>

<a id='line_57'>      as far as we can learn from inscriptions, they never afterwards</a>
<a id='line_58'>      sunk much below that number. See Lipsius de magnitudine Romana,</a>

<a id='line_75'>      (Whitaker’s Review. p. 13.) At the northern extremity of this</a>
<a id='line_76'>      hill (the Viminal) are some considerable remains of a walled</a>
<a id='line_77'>      enclosure which bears all the appearance of a Roman camp, and</a>
<a id='line_78'>      therefore is generally thought to correspond with the Castra</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Prætoria. Cramer’s Italy 390.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>      Such formidable servants are always necessary, but often fatal to</a>
<a id='line_82'>      the throne of despotism. By thus introducing the Prætorian guards</a>
<a id='line_83'>      as it were into the palace and the senate, the emperors taught</a>
<a id='line_84'>      them to perceive their own strength, and the weakness of the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      civil government; to view the vices of their masters with</a>
<a id='line_86'>      familiar contempt, and to lay aside that reverential awe, which</a>
<a id='line_87'>      distance only, and mystery, can preserve towards an imaginary</a>
<a id='line_88'>      power. In the luxurious idleness of an opulent city, their pride</a>
<a id='line_89'>      was nourished by the sense of their irresistible weight; nor was</a>
<a id='line_90'>      it possible to conceal from them, that the person of the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      sovereign, the authority of the senate, the public treasure, and</a>
<a id='line_92'>      the seat of empire, were all in their hands. To divert the</a>
<a id='line_93'>      Prætorian bands from these dangerous reflections, the firmest and</a>
<a id='line_94'>      best established princes were obliged to mix blandishments with</a>
<a id='line_95'>      commands, rewards with punishments, to flatter their pride,</a>
<a id='line_96'>      indulge their pleasures, connive at their irregularities, and to</a>
<a id='line_97'>      purchase their precarious faith by a liberal donative; which,</a>
<a id='line_98'>      since the elevation of Claudius, was enacted as a legal claim, on</a>
<a id='line_99'>      the accession of every new emperor. 6</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>      6 (return) [ Claudius, raised by the soldiers to the empire, was</a>
<a id='line_102'>      the first who gave a donative. He gave quina dena, 120l. (Sueton.</a>
<a id='line_103'>      in Claud. c. 10: ) when Marcus, with his colleague Lucius Versus,</a>
<a id='line_104'>      took quiet possession of the throne, he gave vicena, 160l. to</a>
<a id='line_105'>      each of the guards. Hist. August. p. 25, (Dion, l. lxxiii. p.</a>
<a id='line_106'>      1231.) We may form some idea of the amount of these sums, by</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Hadrian’s complaint that the promotion of a Cæsar had cost him</a>
<a id='line_108'>      ter millies, two millions and a half sterling.]</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>      The advocate of the guards endeavored to justify by arguments the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      power which they asserted by arms; and to maintain that,</a>
<a id='line_112'>      according to the purest principles of the constitution, _their_</a>
<a id='line_113'>      consent was essentially necessary in the appointment of an</a>
<a id='line_114'>      emperor. The election of consuls, of generals, and of</a>
<a id='line_115'>      magistrates, however it had been recently usurped by the senate,</a>
<a id='line_116'>      was the ancient and undoubted right of the Roman people. 7 But</a>
<a id='line_117'>      where was the Roman people to be found? Not surely amongst the</a>
<a id='line_118'>      mixed multitude of slaves and strangers that filled the streets</a>
<a id='line_119'>      of Rome; a servile populace, as devoid of spirit as destitute of</a>
<a id='line_120'>      property. The defenders of the state, selected from the flower of</a>
<a id='line_121'>      the Italian youth, 8 and trained in the exercise of arms and</a>
<a id='line_122'>      virtue, were the genuine representatives of the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_123'>      best entitled to elect the military chief of the republic. These</a>
<a id='line_124'>      assertions, however defective in reason, became unanswerable when</a>
<a id='line_125'>      the fierce Prætorians increased their weight, by throwing, like</a>
<a id='line_126'>      the barbarian conqueror of Rome, their swords into the scale. 9</a>

<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>      The Prætorians had violated the sanctity of the throne by the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      atrocious murder of Pertinax; they dishonored the majesty of it</a>
<a id='line_142'>      by their subsequent conduct. The camp was without a leader, for</a>
<a id='line_143'>      even the præfect Lætus, who had excited the tempest, prudently</a>
<a id='line_144'>      declined the public indignation. Amidst the wild disorder,</a>
<a id='line_145'>      Sulpicianus, the emperor’s father-in-law, and governor of the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      city, who had been sent to the camp on the first alarm of mutiny,</a>
<a id='line_147'>      was endeavoring to calm the fury of the multitude, when he was</a>
<a id='line_148'>      silenced by the clamorous return of the murderers, bearing on a</a>
<a id='line_149'>      lance the head of Pertinax. Though history has accustomed us to</a>
<a id='line_150'>      observe every principle and every passion yielding to the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      imperious dictates of ambition, it is scarcely credible that, in</a>
<a id='line_152'>      these moments of horror, Sulpicianus should have aspired to</a>
<a id='line_153'>      ascend a throne polluted with the recent blood of so near a</a>
<a id='line_154'>      relation and so excellent a prince. He had already begun to use</a>
<a id='line_155'>      the only effectual argument, and to treat for the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_156'>      dignity; but the more prudent of the Prætorians, apprehensive</a>
<a id='line_157'>      that, in this private contract, they should not obtain a just</a>
<a id='line_158'>      price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts;</a>
<a id='line_159'>      and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be</a>
<a id='line_160'>      disposed of to the best bidder by public auction. 10</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>      10 (return) [ Dion, L. lxxiii. p. 1234. Herodian, l. ii. p. 63.</a>
<a id='line_163'>      Hist. August p. 60. Though the three historians agree that it was</a>
<a id='line_164'>      in fact an auction, Herodian alone affirms that it was proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_165'>      as such by the soldiers.]</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>      This infamous offer, the most insolent excess of military</a>
<a id='line_168'>      license, diffused a universal grief, shame, and indignation</a>
<a id='line_169'>      throughout the city. It reached at length the ears of Didius</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Julianus, a wealthy senator, who, regardless of the public</a>
<a id='line_171'>      calamities, was indulging himself in the luxury of the table. 11</a>
<a id='line_172'>      His wife and his daughter, his freedmen and his parasites, easily</a>
<a id='line_173'>      convinced him that he deserved the throne, and earnestly conjured</a>
<a id='line_174'>      him to embrace so fortunate an opportunity. The vain old man</a>
<a id='line_175'>      hastened to the Prætorian camp, where Sulpicianus was still in</a>
<a id='line_176'>      treaty with the guards, and began to bid against him from the</a>
<a id='line_177'>      foot of the rampart. The unworthy negotiation was transacted by</a>
<a id='line_178'>      faithful emissaries, who passed alternately from one candidate to</a>
<a id='line_179'>      the other, and acquainted each of them with the offers of his</a>
<a id='line_180'>      rival. Sulpicianus had already promised a donative of five</a>
<a id='line_181'>      thousand drachms (above one hundred and sixty pounds) to each</a>
<a id='line_182'>      soldier; when Julian, eager for the prize, rose at once to the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      sum of six thousand two hundred and fifty drachms, or upwards of</a>
<a id='line_184'>      two hundred pounds sterling. The gates of the camp were instantly</a>
<a id='line_185'>      thrown open to the purchaser; he was declared emperor, and</a>
<a id='line_186'>      received an oath of allegiance from the soldiers, who retained</a>
<a id='line_187'>      humanity enough to stipulate that he should pardon and forget the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      competition of Sulpicianus. 111</a>

<a id='line_193'>      111 (return) [ One of the principal causes of the preference of</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Julianus by the soldiers, was the dexterty dexterity with which</a>
<a id='line_195'>      he reminded them that Sulpicianus would not fail to revenge on</a>
<a id='line_196'>      them the death of his son-in-law. (See Dion, p. 1234, 1234. c.</a>
<a id='line_197'>      11. Herod. ii. 6.)—W.]</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>      It was now incumbent on the Prætorians to fulfil the conditions</a>
<a id='line_200'>      of the sale. They placed their new sovereign, whom they served</a>
<a id='line_201'>      and despised, in the centre of their ranks, surrounded him on</a>
<a id='line_202'>      every side with their shields, and conducted him in close order</a>
<a id='line_203'>      of battle through the deserted streets of the city. The senate</a>
<a id='line_204'>      was commanded to assemble; and those who had been the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      distinguished friends of Pertinax, or the personal enemies of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      Julian, found it necessary to affect a more than common share of</a>
<a id='line_207'>      satisfaction at this happy revolution. 12 After Julian had filled</a>
<a id='line_208'>      the senate house with armed soldiers, he expatiated on the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      freedom of his election, his own eminent virtues, and his full</a>
<a id='line_210'>      assurance of the affections of the senate. The obsequious</a>
<a id='line_211'>      assembly congratulated their own and the public felicity; engaged</a>
<a id='line_212'>      their allegiance, and conferred on him all the several branches</a>
<a id='line_213'>      of the Imperial power. 13 From the senate Julian was conducted,</a>
<a id='line_214'>      by the same military procession, to take possession of the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      palace. The first objects that struck his eyes, were the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      abandoned trunk of Pertinax, and the frugal entertainment</a>
<a id='line_217'>      prepared for his supper. The one he viewed with indifference, the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      other with contempt. A magnificent feast was prepared by his</a>
<a id='line_219'>      order, and he amused himself, till a very late hour, with dice,</a>
<a id='line_220'>      and the performances of Pylades, a celebrated dancer. Yet it was</a>
<a id='line_221'>      observed, that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed, and left</a>
<a id='line_222'>      him to darkness, solitude, and terrible reflection, he passed a</a>
<a id='line_223'>      sleepless night; revolving most probably in his mind his own rash</a>
<a id='line_224'>      folly, the fate of his virtuous predecessor, and the doubtful and</a>
<a id='line_225'>      dangerous tenure of an empire which had not been acquired by</a>
<a id='line_226'>      merit, but purchased by money. 14</a>

<a id='line_234'>      families. Note: A new fragment of Dion shows some shrewdness in</a>
<a id='line_235'>      the character of Julian. When the senate voted him a golden</a>
<a id='line_236'>      statue, he preferred one of brass, as more lasting. He “had</a>
<a id='line_237'>      always observed,” he said, “that the statues of former emperors</a>
<a id='line_238'>      were soon destroyed. Those of brass alone remained.” The</a>
<a id='line_239'>      indignant historian adds that he was wrong. The virtue of</a>

<a id='line_256'>      had persuaded them to accept; nor was there a citizen who did not</a>
<a id='line_257'>      consider his elevation with horror, as the last insult on the</a>
<a id='line_258'>      Roman name. The nobility, whose conspicuous station, and ample</a>
<a id='line_259'>      possessions, exacted the strictest caution, dissembled their</a>
<a id='line_260'>      sentiments, and met the affected civility of the emperor with</a>
<a id='line_261'>      smiles of complacency and professions of duty. But the people,</a>
<a id='line_262'>      secure in their numbers and obscurity, gave a free vent to their</a>
<a id='line_263'>      passions. The streets and public places of Rome resounded with</a>
<a id='line_264'>      clamors and imprecations. The enraged multitude affronted the</a>
<a id='line_265'>      person of Julian, rejected his liberality, and, conscious of the</a>
<a id='line_266'>      impotence of their own resentment, they called aloud on the</a>
<a id='line_267'>      legions of the frontiers to assert the violated majesty of the</a>
<a id='line_268'>      Roman empire. The public discontent was soon diffused from the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      centre to the frontiers of the empire. The armies of Britain, of</a>
<a id='line_270'>      Syria, and of Illyricum, lamented the death of Pertinax, in whose</a>
<a id='line_271'>      company, or under whose command, they had so often fought and</a>
<a id='line_272'>      conquered. They received with surprise, with indignation, and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      perhaps with envy, the extraordinary intelligence, that the</a>
<a id='line_274'>      Prætorians had disposed of the empire by public auction; and they</a>
<a id='line_275'>      sternly refused to ratify the ignominious bargain. Their</a>
<a id='line_276'>      immediate and unanimous revolt was fatal to Julian, but it was</a>
<a id='line_277'>      fatal at the same time to the public peace, as the generals of</a>
<a id='line_278'>      the respective armies, Clodius Albinus, Pescennius Niger, and</a>
<a id='line_279'>      Septimius Severus, were still more anxious to succeed than to</a>
<a id='line_280'>      revenge the murdered Pertinax. Their forces were exactly</a>
<a id='line_281'>      balanced. Each of them was at the head of three legions, 15 with</a>
<a id='line_282'>      a numerous train of auxiliaries; and however different in their</a>
<a id='line_283'>      characters, they were all soldiers of experience and capacity.</a>

<a id='line_287'>      Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, surpassed both his</a>
<a id='line_288'>      competitors in the nobility of his extraction, which he derived</a>
<a id='line_289'>      from some of the most illustrious names of the old republic. 16</a>
<a id='line_290'>      But the branch from which he claimed his descent was sunk into</a>
<a id='line_291'>      mean circumstances, and transplanted into a remote province. It</a>
<a id='line_292'>      is difficult to form a just idea of his true character. Under the</a>
<a id='line_293'>      philosophic cloak of austerity, he stands accused of concealing</a>
<a id='line_294'>      most of the vices which degrade human nature. 17 But his accusers</a>
<a id='line_295'>      are those venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus, and</a>
<a id='line_296'>      trampled on the ashes of an unsuccessful rival. Virtue, or the</a>
<a id='line_297'>      appearances of virtue, recommended Albinus to the confidence and</a>
<a id='line_298'>      good opinion of Marcus; and his preserving with the son the same</a>
<a id='line_299'>      interest which he had acquired with the father, is a proof at</a>
<a id='line_300'>      least that he was possessed of a very flexible disposition. The</a>
<a id='line_301'>      favor of a tyrant does not always suppose a want of merit in the</a>
<a id='line_302'>      object of it; he may, without intending it, reward a man of worth</a>
<a id='line_303'>      and ability, or he may find such a man useful to his own service.</a>
<a id='line_304'>      It does not appear that Albinus served the son of Marcus, either</a>
<a id='line_305'>      as the minister of his cruelties, or even as the associate of his</a>
<a id='line_306'>      pleasures. He was employed in a distant honorable command, when</a>
<a id='line_307'>      he received a confidential letter from the emperor, acquainting</a>
<a id='line_308'>      him of the treasonable designs of some discontented generals, and</a>
<a id='line_309'>      authorizing him to declare himself the guardian and successor of</a>
<a id='line_310'>      the throne, by assuming the title and ensigns of Cæsar. 18 The</a>
<a id='line_311'>      governor of Britain wisely declined the dangerous honor, which</a>
<a id='line_312'>      would have marked him for the jealousy, or involved him in the</a>
<a id='line_313'>      approaching ruin, of Commodus. He courted power by nobler, or, at</a>
<a id='line_314'>      least, by more specious arts. On a premature report of the death</a>
<a id='line_315'>      of the emperor, he assembled his troops; and, in an eloquent</a>
<a id='line_316'>      discourse, deplored the inevitable mischiefs of despotism,</a>
<a id='line_317'>      described the happiness and glory which their ancestors had</a>
<a id='line_318'>      enjoyed under the consular government, and declared his firm</a>
<a id='line_319'>      resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal</a>
<a id='line_320'>      authority. This popular harangue was answered by the loud</a>
<a id='line_321'>      acclamations of the British legions, and received at Rome with a</a>
<a id='line_322'>      secret murmur of applause. Safe in the possession of his little</a>
<a id='line_323'>      world, and in the command of an army less distinguished indeed</a>
<a id='line_324'>      for discipline than for numbers and valor, 19 Albinus braved the</a>
<a id='line_325'>      menaces of Commodus, maintained towards Pertinax a stately</a>
<a id='line_326'>      ambiguous reserve, and instantly declared against the usurpation</a>
<a id='line_327'>      of Julian. The convulsions of the capital added new weight to his</a>
<a id='line_328'>      sentiments, or rather to his professions of patriotism. A regard</a>
<a id='line_329'>      to decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Augustus</a>

<a id='line_619'>      dictated by policy, the other by decency; the revenge, and the</a>
<a id='line_620'>      honors, due to the memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor</a>
<a id='line_621'>      entered Rome, he issued his commands to the Prætorian guards,</a>
<a id='line_622'>      directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the</a>
<a id='line_623'>      city, without arms, but in the habits of ceremony, in which they</a>
<a id='line_624'>      were accustomed to attend their sovereign. He was obeyed by those</a>
<a id='line_625'>      haughty troops, whose contrition was the effect of their just</a>
<a id='line_626'>      terrors. A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them with</a>

<a id='line_632'>      pain of death, to the distance of a hundred miles from the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      capital. During the transaction, another detachment had been sent</a>
<a id='line_634'>      to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and prevent the hasty</a>

<a id='line_640'>      melancholy pleasure, performed the last rites to that excellent</a>
<a id='line_641'>      prince, whom they had loved, and still regretted. The concern of</a>
<a id='line_642'>      his successor was probably less sincere; he esteemed the virtues</a>
<a id='line_643'>      of Pertinax, but those virtues would forever have confined his</a>
<a id='line_644'>      ambition to a private station. Severus pronounced his funeral</a>
<a id='line_645'>      oration with studied eloquence, inward satisfaction, and</a>
<a id='line_646'>      well-acted sorrow; and by this pious regard to his memory,</a>

<a id='line_661'>      could reconcile and unite the love of pleasure, the thirst of</a>
<a id='line_662'>      knowledge, and the fire of ambition? 41 In one instance only,</a>
<a id='line_663'>      they may be compared, with some degree of propriety, in the</a>
<a id='line_664'>      celerity of their motions, and their civil victories. In less</a>
<a id='line_665'>      than four years, 42 Severus subdued the riches of the East, and</a>
<a id='line_666'>      the valor of the West. He vanquished two competitors of</a>
<a id='line_667'>      reputation and ability, and defeated numerous armies, provided</a>
<a id='line_668'>      with weapons and discipline equal to his own. In that age, the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      art of fortification, and the principles of tactics, were well</a>
<a id='line_670'>      understood by all the Roman generals; and the constant</a>
<a id='line_671'>      superiority of Severus was that of an artist, who uses the same</a>
<a id='line_672'>      instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals. I shall</a>
<a id='line_673'>      not, however, enter into a minute narrative of these military</a>

<a id='line_742'>      highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of</a>

<a id='line_861'>      debt to discharge, was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty</a>

<a id='line_863'>      the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities capable of</a>

<a id='line_877'>      disappointed this prudent scheme of defence; he left to his</a>
<a id='line_878'>      generals the siege of Byzantium, forced the less guarded passage</a>
<a id='line_879'>      of the Hellespont, and, impatient of a meaner enemy, pressed</a>

<a id='line_917'>      ruins. There is no contradiction between the relation of Dion and</a>

<a id='line_1194'>      Severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps, and</a>

<a id='line_1211'>      a republic insensibly vanished, and made way for the more natural</a>

<a id='line_1215'>      with abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      obliterated. The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines 70</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      observe, with a malicious pleasure, that although the sovereign</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      of Rome, in compliance with an obsolete prejudice, abstained from</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      the name of king, he possessed the full measure of regal power.</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      In the reign of Severus, the senate was filled with polished and</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces, who justified</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude. These</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      court, and with patience by the people, when they inculcated the</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      duty of passive obedience, and descanted on the inevitable</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      mischiefs of freedom. The lawyers and historians concurred in</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      teaching, that the Imperial authority was held, not by the</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      delegated commission, but by the irrevocable resignation of the</a>

<a id='line_1231'>      of his subjects, and might dispose of the empire as of his</a>
