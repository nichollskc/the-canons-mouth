                    <a id='line_0'>A LOVER’S COMPLAINT</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'></a>
<a id='line_4'>From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</a>
<a id='line_5'>A plaintful story from a sist’ring vale,</a>
<a id='line_6'>My spirits t’attend this double voice accorded,</a>
<a id='line_7'>And down I laid to list the sad-tun’d tale;</a>
<a id='line_8'>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,</a>
<a id='line_9'>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</a>
<a id='line_10'>Storming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</a>
<a id='line_13'>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</a>
<a id='line_14'>Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</a>
<a id='line_15'>The carcass of a beauty spent and done;</a>
<a id='line_16'>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</a>
<a id='line_17'>Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven’s fell rage</a>
<a id='line_18'>Some beauty peeped through lattice of sear’d age.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</a>
<a id='line_21'>Which on it had conceited characters,</a>
<a id='line_22'>Laund’ring the silken figures in the brine</a>
<a id='line_23'>That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</a>
<a id='line_24'>And often reading what contents it bears;</a>
<a id='line_25'>As often shrieking undistinguish’d woe,</a>
<a id='line_26'>In clamours of all size, both high and low.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>Sometimes her levell’d eyes their carriage ride,</a>
<a id='line_29'>As they did batt’ry to the spheres intend;</a>
<a id='line_30'>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</a>
<a id='line_31'>To th’orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</a>
<a id='line_32'>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</a>
<a id='line_33'>To every place at once, and nowhere fix’d,</a>
<a id='line_34'>The mind and sight distractedly commix’d.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</a>
<a id='line_37'>Proclaim’d in her a careless hand of pride;</a>
<a id='line_38'>For some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat,</a>
<a id='line_39'>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</a>
<a id='line_40'>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</a>
<a id='line_41'>And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,</a>
<a id='line_42'>Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>A thousand favours from a maund she drew,</a>
<a id='line_45'>Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</a>
<a id='line_46'>Which one by one she in a river threw,</a>
<a id='line_47'>Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</a>
<a id='line_48'>Like usury applying wet to wet,</a>
<a id='line_49'>Or monarchs’ hands, that lets not bounty fall</a>
<a id='line_50'>Where want cries ‘some,’ but where excess begs ‘all’.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>Of folded schedules had she many a one,</a>
<a id='line_53'>Which she perus’d, sigh’d, tore and gave the flood;</a>
<a id='line_54'>Crack’d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</a>
<a id='line_55'>Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;</a>
<a id='line_56'>Found yet mo letters sadly penn’d in blood,</a>
<a id='line_57'>With sleided silk, feat and affectedly</a>
<a id='line_58'>Enswath’d, and seal’d to curious secrecy.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>These often bath’d she in her fluxive eyes,</a>
<a id='line_61'>And often kiss’d, and often gave to tear;</a>
<a id='line_62'>Cried, ‘O false blood, thou register of lies,</a>
<a id='line_63'>What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</a>
<a id='line_64'>Ink would have seem’d more black and damned here!’</a>
<a id='line_65'>This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</a>
<a id='line_66'>Big discontent so breaking their contents.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,</a>
<a id='line_69'>Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew</a>
<a id='line_70'>Of court, of city, and had let go by</a>
<a id='line_71'>The swiftest hours observed as they flew,</a>
<a id='line_72'>Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;</a>
<a id='line_73'>And, privileg’d by age, desires to know</a>
<a id='line_74'>In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>So slides he down upon his grained bat,</a>
<a id='line_77'>And comely distant sits he by her side,</a>
<a id='line_78'>When he again desires her, being sat,</a>
<a id='line_79'>Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</a>
<a id='line_80'>If that from him there may be aught applied</a>
<a id='line_81'>Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</a>
<a id='line_82'>’Tis promised in the charity of age.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>‘Father,’ she says, ‘though in me you behold</a>
<a id='line_85'>The injury of many a blasting hour,</a>
<a id='line_86'>Let it not tell your judgement I am old,</a>
<a id='line_87'>Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power.</a>
<a id='line_88'>I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</a>
<a id='line_89'>Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</a>
<a id='line_90'>Love to myself, and to no love beside.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>‘But woe is me! Too early I attended</a>
<a id='line_93'>A youthful suit; it was to gain my grace;</a>
<a id='line_94'>O one by nature’s outwards so commended,</a>
<a id='line_95'>That maiden’s eyes stuck over all his face,</a>
<a id='line_96'>Love lack’d a dwelling and made him her place;</a>
<a id='line_97'>And when in his fair parts she did abide,</a>
<a id='line_98'>She was new lodg’d and newly deified.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>‘His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,</a>
<a id='line_101'>And every light occasion of the wind</a>
<a id='line_102'>Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls,</a>
<a id='line_103'>What’s sweet to do, to do will aptly find,</a>
<a id='line_104'>Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind:</a>
<a id='line_105'>For on his visage was in little drawn,</a>
<a id='line_106'>What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>‘Small show of man was yet upon his chin;</a>
<a id='line_109'>His phoenix down began but to appear,</a>
<a id='line_110'>Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,</a>
<a id='line_111'>Whose bare out-bragg’d the web it seemed to wear.</a>
<a id='line_112'>Yet show’d his visage by that cost more dear,</a>
<a id='line_113'>And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</a>
<a id='line_114'>If best were as it was, or best without.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>‘His qualities were beauteous as his form,</a>
<a id='line_117'>For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;</a>
<a id='line_118'>Yet if men mov’d him, was he such a storm</a>
<a id='line_119'>As oft ’twixt May and April is to see,</a>
<a id='line_120'>When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</a>
<a id='line_121'>His rudeness so with his authoriz’d youth</a>
<a id='line_122'>Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>‘Well could he ride, and often men would say</a>
<a id='line_125'>That horse his mettle from his rider takes,</a>
<a id='line_126'>Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</a>
<a id='line_127'>What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!</a>
<a id='line_128'>And controversy hence a question takes,</a>
<a id='line_129'>Whether the horse by him became his deed,</a>
<a id='line_130'>Or he his manage by th’ well-doing steed.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>‘But quickly on this side the verdict went,</a>
<a id='line_133'>His real habitude gave life and grace</a>
<a id='line_134'>To appertainings and to ornament,</a>
<a id='line_135'>Accomplish’d in himself, not in his case;</a>
<a id='line_136'>All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</a>
<a id='line_137'>Came for additions; yet their purpos’d trim</a>
<a id='line_138'>Piec’d not his grace, but were all grac’d by him.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>‘So on the tip of his subduing tongue</a>
<a id='line_141'>All kind of arguments and question deep,</a>
<a id='line_142'>All replication prompt, and reason strong,</a>
<a id='line_143'>For his advantage still did wake and sleep,</a>
<a id='line_144'>To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep:</a>
<a id='line_145'>He had the dialect and different skill,</a>
<a id='line_146'>Catching all passions in his craft of will.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>‘That he did in the general bosom reign</a>
<a id='line_149'>Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,</a>
<a id='line_150'>To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</a>
<a id='line_151'>In personal duty, following where he haunted,</a>
<a id='line_152'>Consent’s bewitch’d, ere he desire, have granted,</a>
<a id='line_153'>And dialogued for him what he would say,</a>
<a id='line_154'>Ask’d their own wills, and made their wills obey.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>‘Many there were that did his picture get</a>
<a id='line_157'>To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,</a>
<a id='line_158'>Like fools that in th’ imagination set</a>
<a id='line_159'>The goodly objects which abroad they find</a>
<a id='line_160'>Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign’d,</a>
<a id='line_161'>And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them,</a>
<a id='line_162'>Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>‘So many have, that never touch’d his hand,</a>
<a id='line_165'>Sweetly suppos’d them mistress of his heart.</a>
<a id='line_166'>My woeful self that did in freedom stand,</a>
<a id='line_167'>And was my own fee-simple (not in part)</a>
<a id='line_168'>What with his art in youth, and youth in art,</a>
<a id='line_169'>Threw my affections in his charmed power,</a>
<a id='line_170'>Reserv’d the stalk and gave him all my flower.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>‘Yet did I not, as some my equals did,</a>
<a id='line_173'>Demand of him, nor being desired yielded,</a>
<a id='line_174'>Finding myself in honour so forbid,</a>
<a id='line_175'>With safest distance I mine honour shielded.</a>
<a id='line_176'>Experience for me many bulwarks builded</a>
<a id='line_177'>Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain’d the foil</a>
<a id='line_178'>Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>‘But ah! Who ever shunn’d by precedent</a>
<a id='line_181'>The destin’d ill she must herself assay,</a>
<a id='line_182'>Or force’d examples ’gainst her own content,</a>
<a id='line_183'>To put the by-pass’d perils in her way?</a>
<a id='line_184'>Counsel may stop a while what will not stay:</a>
<a id='line_185'>For when we rage, advice is often seen</a>
<a id='line_186'>By blunting us to make our wills more keen.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>‘Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,</a>
<a id='line_189'>That we must curb it upon others’ proof,</a>
<a id='line_190'>To be forbode the sweets that seems so good,</a>
<a id='line_191'>For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.</a>
<a id='line_192'>O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!</a>
<a id='line_193'>The one a palate hath that needs will taste,</a>
<a id='line_194'>Though reason weep and cry, “It is thy last.”</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>‘For further I could say, “This man’s untrue”,</a>
<a id='line_197'>And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;</a>
<a id='line_198'>Heard where his plants in others’ orchards grew,</a>
<a id='line_199'>Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;</a>
<a id='line_200'>Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;</a>
<a id='line_201'>Thought characters and words merely but art,</a>
<a id='line_202'>And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>‘And long upon these terms I held my city,</a>
<a id='line_205'>Till thus he ’gan besiege me: “Gentle maid,</a>
<a id='line_206'>Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,</a>
<a id='line_207'>And be not of my holy vows afraid:</a>
<a id='line_208'>That’s to ye sworn, to none was ever said,</a>
<a id='line_209'>For feasts of love I have been call’d unto,</a>
<a id='line_210'>Till now did ne’er invite, nor never woo.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>‘“All my offences that abroad you see</a>
<a id='line_213'>Are errors of the blood, none of the mind:</a>
<a id='line_214'>Love made them not; with acture they may be,</a>
<a id='line_215'>Where neither party is nor true nor kind,</a>
<a id='line_216'>They sought their shame that so their shame did find,</a>
<a id='line_217'>And so much less of shame in me remains,</a>
<a id='line_218'>By how much of me their reproach contains.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>‘“Among the many that mine eyes have seen,</a>
<a id='line_221'>Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,</a>
<a id='line_222'>Or my affection put to th’ smallest teen,</a>
<a id='line_223'>Or any of my leisures ever charmed:</a>
<a id='line_224'>Harm have I done to them, but ne’er was harmed;</a>
<a id='line_225'>Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,</a>
<a id='line_226'>And reign’d commanding in his monarchy.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>‘“Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,</a>
<a id='line_229'>Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood,</a>
<a id='line_230'>Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me</a>
<a id='line_231'>Of grief and blushes, aptly understood</a>
<a id='line_232'>In bloodless white and the encrimson’d mood;</a>
<a id='line_233'>Effects of terror and dear modesty,</a>
<a id='line_234'>Encamp’d in hearts, but fighting outwardly.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>‘“And, lo! behold these talents of their hair,</a>
<a id='line_237'>With twisted metal amorously empleach’d,</a>
<a id='line_238'>I have receiv’d from many a several fair,</a>
<a id='line_239'>Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech’d,</a>
<a id='line_240'>With th’ annexions of fair gems enrich’d,</a>
<a id='line_241'>And deep-brain’d sonnets that did amplify</a>
<a id='line_242'>Each stone’s dear nature, worth and quality.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>‘“The diamond, why ’twas beautiful and hard,</a>
<a id='line_245'>Whereto his invis’d properties did tend,</a>
<a id='line_246'>The deep green emerald, in whose fresh regard</a>
<a id='line_247'>Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;</a>
<a id='line_248'>The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend</a>
<a id='line_249'>With objects manifold; each several stone,</a>
<a id='line_250'>With wit well blazon’d smil’d, or made some moan.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>‘“Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,</a>
<a id='line_253'>Of pensiv’d and subdued desires the tender,</a>
<a id='line_254'>Nature hath charg’d me that I hoard them not,</a>
<a id='line_255'>But yield them up where I myself must render,</a>
<a id='line_256'>That is, to you, my origin and ender:</a>
<a id='line_257'>For these of force must your oblations be,</a>
<a id='line_258'>Since I their altar, you empatron me.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>‘“O then advance of yours that phraseless hand,</a>
<a id='line_261'>Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;</a>
<a id='line_262'>Take all these similes to your own command,</a>
<a id='line_263'>Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise:</a>
<a id='line_264'>What me, your minister for you, obeys,</a>
<a id='line_265'>Works under you; and to your audit comes</a>
<a id='line_266'>Their distract parcels in combined sums.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>‘“Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,</a>
<a id='line_269'>Or sister sanctified of holiest note,</a>
<a id='line_270'>Which late her noble suit in court did shun,</a>
<a id='line_271'>Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;</a>
<a id='line_272'>For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,</a>
<a id='line_273'>But kept cold distance, and did thence remove</a>
<a id='line_274'>To spend her living in eternal love.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>‘“But O, my sweet, what labour is’t to leave</a>
<a id='line_277'>The thing we have not, mast’ring what not strives,</a>
<a id='line_278'>Planing the place which did no form receive,</a>
<a id='line_279'>Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves,</a>
<a id='line_280'>She that her fame so to herself contrives,</a>
<a id='line_281'>The scars of battle ’scapeth by the flight,</a>
<a id='line_282'>And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>‘“O pardon me, in that my boast is true,</a>
<a id='line_285'>The accident which brought me to her eye,</a>
<a id='line_286'>Upon the moment did her force subdue,</a>
<a id='line_287'>And now she would the caged cloister fly:</a>
<a id='line_288'>Religious love put out religion’s eye:</a>
<a id='line_289'>Not to be tempted would she be immur’d,</a>
<a id='line_290'>And now to tempt all, liberty procur’d.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>‘“How mighty then you are, O hear me tell!</a>
<a id='line_293'>The broken bosoms that to me belong</a>
<a id='line_294'>Have emptied all their fountains in my well,</a>
<a id='line_295'>And mine I pour your ocean all among:</a>
<a id='line_296'>I strong o’er them, and you o’er me being strong,</a>
<a id='line_297'>Must for your victory us all congest,</a>
<a id='line_298'>As compound love to physic your cold breast.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>‘“My parts had pow’r to charm a sacred nun,</a>
<a id='line_301'>Who, disciplin’d and dieted in grace,</a>
<a id='line_302'>Believ’d her eyes when they t’assail begun,</a>
<a id='line_303'>All vows and consecrations giving place.</a>
<a id='line_304'>O most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space,</a>
<a id='line_305'>In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,</a>
<a id='line_306'>For thou art all and all things else are thine.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>‘“When thou impressest, what are precepts worth</a>
<a id='line_309'>Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,</a>
<a id='line_310'>How coldly those impediments stand forth,</a>
<a id='line_311'>Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!</a>
<a id='line_312'>Love’s arms are peace, ’gainst rule, ’gainst sense, ’gainst shame,</a>
<a id='line_313'>And sweetens, in the suff’ring pangs it bears,</a>
<a id='line_314'>The aloes of all forces, shocks and fears.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>‘“Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,</a>
<a id='line_317'>Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,</a>
<a id='line_318'>And supplicant their sighs to your extend,</a>
<a id='line_319'>To leave the batt’ry that you make ’gainst mine,</a>
<a id='line_320'>Lending soft audience to my sweet design,</a>
<a id='line_321'>And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,</a>
<a id='line_322'>That shall prefer and undertake my troth.”</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>‘This said, his wat’ry eyes he did dismount,</a>
<a id='line_325'>Whose sights till then were levell’d on my face;</a>
<a id='line_326'>Each cheek a river running from a fount</a>
<a id='line_327'>With brinish current downward flowed apace.</a>
<a id='line_328'>O how the channel to the stream gave grace!</a>
<a id='line_329'>Who, glaz’d with crystal gate the glowing roses</a>
<a id='line_330'>That flame through water which their hue encloses.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>‘O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies</a>
<a id='line_333'>In the small orb of one particular tear!</a>
<a id='line_334'>But with the inundation of the eyes</a>
<a id='line_335'>What rocky heart to water will not wear?</a>
<a id='line_336'>What breast so cold that is not warmed here?</a>
<a id='line_337'>O cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,</a>
<a id='line_338'>Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>‘For lo, his passion, but an art of craft,</a>
<a id='line_341'>Even there resolv’d my reason into tears;</a>
<a id='line_342'>There my white stole of chastity I daff’d,</a>
<a id='line_343'>Shook off my sober guards, and civil fears,</a>
<a id='line_344'>Appear to him as he to me appears,</a>
<a id='line_345'>All melting, though our drops this diff’rence bore:</a>
<a id='line_346'>His poison’d me, and mine did him restore.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>‘In him a plenitude of subtle matter,</a>
<a id='line_349'>Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</a>
<a id='line_350'>Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</a>
<a id='line_351'>Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,</a>
<a id='line_352'>In either’s aptness, as it best deceives,</a>
<a id='line_353'>To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,</a>
<a id='line_354'>Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>‘That not a heart which in his level came</a>
<a id='line_357'>Could ’scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,</a>
<a id='line_358'>Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;</a>
<a id='line_359'>And veil’d in them, did win whom he would maim.</a>
<a id='line_360'>Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;</a>
<a id='line_361'>When he most burned in heart-wish’d luxury,</a>
<a id='line_362'>He preach’d pure maid, and prais’d cold chastity.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>‘Thus merely with the garment of a grace,</a>
<a id='line_365'>The naked and concealed fiend he cover’d,</a>
<a id='line_366'>That th’unexperient gave the tempter place,</a>
<a id='line_367'>Which, like a cherubin, above them hover’d.</a>
<a id='line_368'>Who, young and simple, would not be so lover’d?</a>
<a id='line_369'>Ay me! I fell, and yet do question make</a>
<a id='line_370'>What I should do again for such a sake.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>‘O, that infected moisture of his eye,</a>
<a id='line_373'>O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow’d!</a>
<a id='line_374'>O, that forc’d thunder from his heart did fly,</a>
<a id='line_375'>O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow’d,</a>
<a id='line_376'>O, all that borrowed motion, seeming owed,</a>
<a id='line_377'>Would yet again betray the fore-betrayed,</a>
<a id='line_378'>And new pervert a reconciled maid.’</a>
