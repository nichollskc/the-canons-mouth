<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      When the Arabs first issued from the desert, they must have been</a>
<a id='line_10'>      surprised at the ease and rapidity of their own success. But when</a>
<a id='line_11'>      they advanced in the career of victory to the banks of the Indus</a>
<a id='line_12'>      and the summit of the Pyrenees; when they had repeatedly tried</a>
<a id='line_13'>      the edge of their cimeters and the energy of their faith, they</a>
<a id='line_14'>      might be equally astonished that any nation could resist their</a>
<a id='line_15'>      invincible arms; that any boundary should confine the dominion of</a>
<a id='line_16'>      the successor of the prophet. The confidence of soldiers and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      fanatics may indeed be excused, since the calm historian of the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      present hour, who strives to follow the rapid course of the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      Saracens, must study to explain by what means the church and</a>
<a id='line_20'>      state were saved from this impending, and, as it should seem,</a>
<a id='line_21'>      from this inevitable, danger. The deserts of Scythia and Sarmatia</a>
<a id='line_22'>      might be guarded by their extent, their climate, their poverty,</a>
<a id='line_23'>      and the courage of the northern shepherds; China was remote and</a>
<a id='line_24'>      inaccessible; but the greatest part of the temperate zone was</a>
<a id='line_25'>      subject to the Mahometan conquerors, the Greeks were exhausted by</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the calamities of war and the loss of their fairest provinces,</a>
<a id='line_27'>      and the Barbarians of Europe might justly tremble at the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      precipitate fall of the Gothic monarchy. In this inquiry I shall</a>
<a id='line_29'>      unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our</a>
<a id='line_30'>      neighbors of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Koran; that protected the majesty of Rome, and delayed the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      servitude of Constantinople; that invigorated the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Christians, and scattered among their enemies the seeds of</a>
<a id='line_34'>      division and decay.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>      Forty-six years after the flight of Mahomet from Mecca, his</a>
<a id='line_37'>      disciples appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople. 1</a>
<a id='line_38'>      They were animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      prophet, that, to the first army which besieged the city of the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Caesars, their sins were forgiven: the long series of Roman</a>
<a id='line_41'>      triumphs would be meritoriously transferred to the conquerors of</a>
<a id='line_42'>      New Rome; and the wealth of nations was deposited in this</a>
<a id='line_43'>      well-chosen seat of royalty and commerce. No sooner had the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established his throne,</a>
<a id='line_45'>      than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood, by the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      success and glory of this holy expedition; 2 his preparations by</a>
<a id='line_47'>      sea and land were adequate to the importance of the object; his</a>
<a id='line_48'>      standard was intrusted to Sophian, a veteran warrior, but the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      troops were encouraged by the example and presence of Yezid, the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      son and presumptive heir of the commander of the faithful. The</a>
<a id='line_51'>      Greeks had little to hope, nor had their enemies any reason of</a>
<a id='line_52'>      fear, from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor, who</a>
<a id='line_53'>      disgraced the name of Constantine, and imitated only the</a>
<a id='line_54'>      inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius. Without delay or</a>
<a id='line_55'>      opposition, the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      unguarded channel of the Hellespont, which even now, under the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      feeble and disorderly government of the Turks, is maintained as</a>
<a id='line_58'>      the natural bulwark of the capital. 3 The Arabian fleet cast</a>
<a id='line_59'>      anchor, and the troops were disembarked near the palace of</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Hebdomon, seven miles from the city. During many days, from the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      dawn of light to the evening, the line of assault was extended</a>
<a id='line_62'>      from the golden gate to the eastern promontory and the foremost</a>
<a id='line_63'>      warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the succeeding</a>
<a id='line_64'>      columns. But the besiegers had formed an insufficient estimate of</a>
<a id='line_65'>      the strength and resources of Constantinople. The solid and lofty</a>
<a id='line_66'>      walls were guarded by numbers and discipline: the spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      Romans was rekindled by the last danger of their religion and</a>
<a id='line_68'>      empire: the fugitives from the conquered provinces more</a>
<a id='line_69'>      successfully renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria; and</a>
<a id='line_70'>      the Saracens were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects</a>
<a id='line_71'>      of artificial fire. This firm and effectual resistance diverted</a>
<a id='line_72'>      their arms to the more easy attempt of plundering the European</a>
<a id='line_73'>      and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis; and, after keeping the sea</a>
<a id='line_74'>      from the month of April to that of September, on the approach of</a>
<a id='line_75'>      winter they retreated fourscore miles from the capital, to the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      Isle of Cyzicus, in which they had established their magazine of</a>
<a id='line_77'>      spoil and provisions. So patient was their perseverance, or so</a>
<a id='line_78'>      languid were their operations, that they repeated in the six</a>
<a id='line_79'>      following summers the same attack and retreat, with a gradual</a>
<a id='line_80'>      abatement of hope and vigor, till the mischances of shipwreck and</a>
<a id='line_81'>      disease, of the sword and of fire, compelled them to relinquish</a>
<a id='line_82'>      the fruitless enterprise. They might bewail the loss, or</a>
<a id='line_83'>      commemorate the martyrdom, of thirty thousand Moslems, who fell</a>
<a id='line_84'>      in the siege of Constantinople; and the solemn funeral of Abu</a>
<a id='line_85'>      Ayub, or Job, excited the curiosity of the Christians themselves.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>      That venerable Arab, one of the last of the companions of</a>
<a id='line_88'>      Mahomet, was numbered among the ansars, or auxiliaries, of</a>
<a id='line_89'>      Medina, who sheltered the head of the flying prophet. In his</a>
<a id='line_90'>      youth he fought, at Beder and Ohud, under the holy standard: in</a>
<a id='line_91'>      his mature age he was the friend and follower of Ali; and the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      last remnant of his strength and life was consumed in a distant</a>
<a id='line_93'>      and dangerous war against the enemies of the Koran. His memory</a>
<a id='line_94'>      was revered; but the place of his burial was neglected and</a>
<a id='line_95'>      unknown, during a period of seven hundred and eighty years, till</a>
<a id='line_96'>      the conquest of Constantinople by Mahomet the Second. A</a>
<a id='line_97'>      seasonable vision (for such are the manufacture of every</a>
<a id='line_98'>      religion) revealed the holy spot at the foot of the walls and the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      bottom of the harbor; and the mosch of Ayub has been deservedly</a>
<a id='line_100'>      chosen for the simple and martial inauguration of the Turkish</a>

<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>      The event of the siege revived, both in the East and West, the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      reputation of the Roman arms, and cast a momentary shade over the</a>
<a id='line_138'>      glories of the Saracens. The Greek ambassador was favorably</a>
<a id='line_139'>      received at Damascus, a general council of the emirs or Koreish:</a>
<a id='line_140'>      a peace, or truce, of thirty years was ratified between the two</a>
<a id='line_141'>      empires; and the stipulation of an annual tribute, fifty horses</a>
<a id='line_142'>      of a noble breed, fifty slaves, and three thousand pieces of</a>
<a id='line_143'>      gold, degraded the majesty of the commander of the faithful. 5</a>
<a id='line_144'>      The aged caliph was desirous of possessing his dominions, and</a>
<a id='line_145'>      ending his days in tranquillity and repose: while the Moors and</a>
<a id='line_146'>      Indians trembled at his name, his palace and city of Damascus was</a>
<a id='line_147'>      insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount Libanus, the</a>
<a id='line_148'>      firmest barrier of the empire, till they were disarmed and</a>
<a id='line_149'>      transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. 6 After the</a>
<a id='line_150'>      revolt of Arabia and Persia, the house of Ommiyah was reduced to</a>
<a id='line_151'>      the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt: their distress and fear enforced</a>
<a id='line_152'>      their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians; and</a>
<a id='line_153'>      the tribute was increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand</a>
<a id='line_154'>      pieces of gold, for each of the three hundred and sixty-five days</a>
<a id='line_155'>      of the solar year. But as soon as the empire was again united by</a>
<a id='line_156'>      the arms and policy of Abdalmalek, he disclaimed a badge of</a>
<a id='line_157'>      servitude not less injurious to his conscience than to his pride;</a>
<a id='line_158'>      he discontinued the payment of the tribute; and the resentment of</a>
<a id='line_159'>      the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad tyranny of the</a>
<a id='line_160'>      second Justinian, the just rebellion of his subjects, and the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      frequent change of his antagonists and successors. 7 Till the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      reign of Abdalmalek, the Saracens had been content with the free</a>
<a id='line_163'>      possession of the Persian and Roman treasures, in the coins of</a>
<a id='line_164'>      Chosroes and Caesar. By the command of that caliph, a national</a>
<a id='line_165'>      mint was established, both for silver and gold, and the</a>
<a id='line_166'>      inscription of the Dinar, though it might be censured by some</a>
<a id='line_167'>      timorous casuists, proclaimed the unity of the God of Mahomet. 8</a>
<a id='line_168'>      Under the reign of the caliph Walid, the Greek language and</a>
<a id='line_169'>      characters were excluded from the accounts of the public revenue.</a>

<a id='line_209'>      admitted of late years, that the Arabians, before this epoch, had</a>
<a id='line_210'>      caused coin to be minted, on which, preserving the Roman or the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      Persian dies, they added Arabian names or inscriptions. Some of</a>
<a id='line_212'>      these exist in different collections. We learn from Makrizi, an</a>
<a id='line_213'>      Arabian author of great learning and judgment, that in the year</a>
<a id='line_214'>      18 of the Hegira, under the caliphate of Omar, the Arabs had</a>
<a id='line_215'>      coined money of this description. The same author informs us that</a>
<a id='line_216'>      the caliph Abdalmalek caused coins to be struck representing</a>
<a id='line_217'>      himself with a sword by his side. These types, so contrary to the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      notions of the Arabs, were disapproved by the most influential</a>
<a id='line_219'>      persons of the time, and the caliph substituted for them, after</a>
<a id='line_220'>      the year 76 of the Hegira, the Mahometan coins with which we are</a>

<a id='line_247'>      whilst his lieutenants achieved the conquest of Transoxiana and</a>
<a id='line_248'>      Spain, a third army of Saracens overspread the provinces of Asia</a>

<a id='line_250'>      the attempt and disgrace of the second siege was reserved for his</a>
<a id='line_251'>      brother Soliman, whose ambition appears to have been quickened by</a>
<a id='line_252'>      a more active and martial spirit. In the revolutions of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_253'>      empire, after the tyrant Justinian had been punished and avenged,</a>
<a id='line_254'>      an humble secretary, Anastasius or Artemius, was promoted by</a>
<a id='line_255'>      chance or merit to the vacant purple. He was alarmed by the sound</a>
<a id='line_256'>      of war; and his ambassador returned from Damascus with the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      tremendous news, that the Saracens were preparing an armament by</a>
<a id='line_258'>      sea and land, such as would transcend the experience of the past,</a>
<a id='line_259'>      or the belief of the present age. The precautions of Anastasius</a>
<a id='line_260'>      were not unworthy of his station, or of the impending danger. He</a>
<a id='line_261'>      issued a peremptory mandate, that all persons who were not</a>
<a id='line_262'>      provided with the means of subsistence for a three years’ siege</a>
<a id='line_263'>      should evacuate the city: the public granaries and arsenals were</a>
<a id='line_264'>      abundantly replenished; the walls were restored and strengthened;</a>
<a id='line_265'>      and the engines for casting stones, or darts, or fire, were</a>
<a id='line_266'>      stationed along the ramparts, or in the brigantines of war, of</a>
<a id='line_267'>      which an additional number was hastily constructed. To prevent is</a>
<a id='line_268'>      safer, as well as more honorable, than to repel, an attack; and a</a>
<a id='line_269'>      design was meditated, above the usual spirit of the Greeks, of</a>
<a id='line_270'>      burning the naval stores of the enemy, the cypress timber that</a>
<a id='line_271'>      had been hewn in Mount Libanus, and was piled along the sea-shore</a>
<a id='line_272'>      of Phoenicia, for the service of the Egyptian fleet. This</a>
<a id='line_273'>      generous enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of</a>
<a id='line_274'>      the troops, who, in the new language of the empire, were styled</a>
<a id='line_275'>      of the Obsequian Theme. 11 They murdered their chief, deserted</a>
<a id='line_276'>      their standard in the Isle of Rhodes, dispersed themselves over</a>
<a id='line_277'>      the adjacent continent, and deserved pardon or reward by</a>
<a id='line_278'>      investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue. The</a>
<a id='line_279'>      name of Theodosius might recommend him to the senate and people;</a>
<a id='line_280'>      but, after some months, he sunk into a cloister, and resigned, to</a>
<a id='line_281'>      the firmer hand of Leo the Isaurian, the urgent defence of the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      capital and empire. The most formidable of the Saracens,</a>
<a id='line_283'>      Moslemah, the brother of the caliph, was advancing at the head of</a>
<a id='line_284'>      one hundred and twenty thousand Arabs and Persians, the greater</a>
<a id='line_285'>      part mounted on horses or camels; and the successful sieges of</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Tyana, Amorium, and Pergamus, were of sufficient duration to</a>
<a id='line_287'>      exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes. At the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      well-known passage of Abydus, on the Hellespont, the Mahometan</a>
<a id='line_289'>      arms were transported, for the first time, 1111 from Asia to</a>
<a id='line_290'>      Europe. From thence, wheeling round the Thracian cities of the</a>
<a id='line_291'>      Propontis, Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land side,</a>
<a id='line_292'>      surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart, prepared and</a>
<a id='line_293'>      planted his engines of assault, and declared, by words and</a>
<a id='line_294'>      actions, a patient resolution of expecting the return of</a>
<a id='line_295'>      seed-time and harvest, should the obstinacy of the besieged prove</a>
<a id='line_296'>      equal to his own. 1112 The Greeks would gladly have ransomed</a>
<a id='line_297'>      their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment of a piece of</a>
<a id='line_298'>      gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the liberal</a>
<a id='line_299'>      offer was rejected with disdain, and the presumption of Moslemah</a>
<a id='line_300'>      was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the</a>
<a id='line_301'>      natives of Egypt and Syria. They are said to have amounted to</a>
<a id='line_302'>      eighteen hundred ships: the number betrays their inconsiderable</a>
<a id='line_303'>      size; and of the twenty stout and capacious vessels, whose</a>
<a id='line_304'>      magnitude impeded their progress, each was manned with no more</a>
<a id='line_305'>      than one hundred heavy-armed soldiers. This huge armada proceeded</a>
<a id='line_306'>      on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, towards the mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_307'>      Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was overshadowed, in the</a>
<a id='line_308'>      language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and the same fatal</a>
<a id='line_309'>      night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault</a>
<a id='line_310'>      by sea and land. To allure the confidence of the enemy, the</a>
<a id='line_311'>      emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the</a>
<a id='line_312'>      entrance of the harbor; but while they hesitated whether they</a>
<a id='line_313'>      should seize the opportunity, or apprehend the snare, the</a>
<a id='line_314'>      ministers of destruction were at hand. The fire-ships of the</a>
<a id='line_315'>      Greeks were launched against them; the Arabs, their arms, and</a>
<a id='line_316'>      vessels, were involved in the same flames; the disorderly</a>
<a id='line_317'>      fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the</a>
<a id='line_318'>      waves; and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet, that had</a>
<a id='line_319'>      threatened to extirpate the Roman name. A still more fatal and</a>
<a id='line_320'>      irreparable loss was that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an</a>
<a id='line_321'>      indigestion, 12 in his camp near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria,</a>
<a id='line_322'>      as he was preparing to lead against Constantinople the remaining</a>
<a id='line_323'>      forces of the East. The brother of Moslemah was succeeded by a</a>
<a id='line_324'>      kinsman and an enemy; and the throne of an active and able prince</a>
<a id='line_325'>      was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot.</a>
<a id='line_326'>      1211 While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind</a>
<a id='line_327'>      conscience, the siege was continued through the winter by the</a>
<a id='line_328'>      neglect, rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar. 13 The</a>
<a id='line_329'>      winter proved uncommonly rigorous: above a hundred days the</a>
<a id='line_330'>      ground was covered with deep snow, and the natives of the sultry</a>
<a id='line_331'>      climes of Egypt and Arabia lay torpid and almost lifeless in</a>
<a id='line_332'>      their frozen camp. They revived on the return of spring; a second</a>
<a id='line_333'>      effort had been made in their favor; and their distress was</a>
<a id='line_334'>      relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets, laden with corn,</a>
<a id='line_335'>      and arms, and soldiers; the first from Alexandria, of four</a>
<a id='line_336'>      hundred transports and galleys; the second of three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_337'>      sixty vessels from the ports of Africa. But the Greek fires were</a>
<a id='line_338'>      again kindled; and if the destruction was less complete, it was</a>
<a id='line_339'>      owing to the experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at</a>
<a id='line_340'>      a safe distance, or to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners, who</a>
<a id='line_341'>      deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians. The</a>
<a id='line_342'>      trade and navigation of the capital were restored; and the</a>
<a id='line_343'>      produce of the fisheries supplied the wants, and even the luxury,</a>
<a id='line_344'>      of the inhabitants. But the calamities of famine and disease were</a>
<a id='line_345'>      soon felt by the troops of Moslemah, and as the former was</a>
<a id='line_346'>      miserably assuaged, so the latter was dreadfully propagated, by</a>
<a id='line_347'>      the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract</a>
<a id='line_348'>      from the most unclean or unnatural food. The spirit of conquest,</a>
<a id='line_349'>      and even of enthusiasm, was extinct: the Saracens could no longer</a>
<a id='line_350'>      struggle, beyond their lines, either single or in small parties,</a>
<a id='line_351'>      without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the</a>
<a id='line_352'>      Thracian peasants.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>      An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the Danube by the gifts</a>
<a id='line_355'>      and promises of Leo; and these savage auxiliaries made some</a>
<a id='line_356'>      atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the empire,</a>
<a id='line_357'>      by the defeat and slaughter of twenty-two thousand Asiatics. A</a>
<a id='line_358'>      report was dexterously scattered, that the Franks, the unknown</a>
<a id='line_359'>      nations of the Latin world, were arming by sea and land in the</a>
<a id='line_360'>      defence of the Christian cause, and their formidable aid was</a>
<a id='line_361'>      expected with far different sensations in the camp and city. At</a>
<a id='line_362'>      length, after a siege of thirteen months, 14 the hopeless</a>
<a id='line_363'>      Moslemah received from the caliph the welcome permission of</a>

<a id='line_365'>      Hellespont and through the provinces of Asia, was executed</a>
<a id='line_366'>      without delay or molestation; but an army of their brethren had</a>
<a id='line_367'>      been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia, and the remains of</a>

<a id='line_448'>      guides, so prone to the marvellous, so careless, and, in this</a>
<a id='line_449'>      instance, so jealous of the truth. From their obscure, and</a>
<a id='line_450'>      perhaps fallacious, hints it should seem that the principal</a>
<a id='line_451'>      ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha, 18 or liquid</a>
<a id='line_452'>      bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil, 19 which</a>
<a id='line_453'>      springs from the earth, and catches fire as soon as it comes in</a>
<a id='line_454'>      contact with the air. The naphtha was mingled, I know not by what</a>
<a id='line_455'>      methods or in what proportions, with sulphur and with the pitch</a>
<a id='line_456'>      that is extracted from evergreen firs. 20 From this mixture,</a>
<a id='line_457'>      which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion, proceeded a</a>
<a id='line_458'>      fierce and obstinate flame, which not only rose in perpendicular</a>
<a id='line_459'>      ascent, but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or</a>
<a id='line_460'>      lateral progress; instead of being extinguished, it was nourished</a>
<a id='line_461'>      and quickened by the element of water; and sand, urine, or</a>
<a id='line_462'>      vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this</a>
<a id='line_463'>      powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the Greeks the</a>
<a id='line_464'>      liquid, or the maritime, fire. For the annoyance of the enemy, it</a>
<a id='line_465'>      was employed with equal effect, by sea and land, in battles or in</a>
<a id='line_466'>      sieges. It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers,</a>
<a id='line_467'>      or launched in red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in</a>
<a id='line_468'>      arrows and javelins, twisted round with flax and tow, which had</a>
<a id='line_469'>      deeply imbibed the inflammable oil; sometimes it was deposited in</a>
<a id='line_470'>      fire-ships, the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge,</a>
<a id='line_471'>      and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which</a>
<a id='line_472'>      were planted on the prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped into</a>
<a id='line_473'>      the mouths of savage monsters, that seemed to vomit a stream of</a>
<a id='line_474'>      liquid and consuming fire. This important art was preserved at</a>
<a id='line_475'>      Constantinople, as the palladium of the state: the galleys and</a>
<a id='line_476'>      artillery might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome; but</a>
<a id='line_477'>      the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most</a>
<a id='line_478'>      jealous scruple, and the terror of the enemies was increased and</a>
<a id='line_479'>      prolonged by their ignorance and surprise. In the treaties of the</a>
<a id='line_480'>      administration of the empire, the royal author 21 suggests the</a>
<a id='line_481'>      answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet</a>
<a id='line_482'>      curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians. They should</a>
<a id='line_483'>      be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been revealed by</a>
<a id='line_484'>      an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines, with a</a>
<a id='line_485'>      sacred injunction, that this gift of Heaven, this peculiar</a>
<a id='line_486'>      blessing of the Romans, should never be communicated to any</a>
<a id='line_487'>      foreign nation; that the prince and the subject were alike bound</a>
<a id='line_488'>      to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties</a>
<a id='line_489'>      of treason and sacrilege; and that the impious attempt would</a>
<a id='line_490'>      provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance of the God of the</a>
<a id='line_491'>      Christians. By these precautions, the secret was confined, above</a>

<a id='line_608'>      employment was converted into the patrimony of a private family:</a>

<a id='line_614'>      the territorial lords, were tempted to despise the weakness of</a>
<a id='line_615'>      the monarch, and to imitate the ambition of the mayor. Among</a>
<a id='line_616'>      these independent chiefs, one of the boldest and most successful</a>
<a id='line_617'>      was Eudes, duke of Aquitain, who in the southern provinces of</a>

<a id='line_741'>      the part of a lively and eloquent advocate; and sometimes rises</a>
<a id='line_742'>      to the merit of an historian and philosopher.]</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>      From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and</a>
<a id='line_745'>      fortune of one man. Charles, the illegitimate son of the elder</a>
<a id='line_746'>      Pepin, was content with the titles of mayor or duke of the</a>
<a id='line_747'>      Franks; but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings.</a>
<a id='line_748'>      In a laborious administration of twenty-four years, he restored</a>
<a id='line_749'>      and supported the dignity of the throne, and the rebels of</a>
<a id='line_750'>      Germany and Gaul were successively crushed by the activity of a</a>
<a id='line_751'>      warrior, who, in the same campaign, could display his banner on</a>
<a id='line_752'>      the Elbe, the Rhone, and the shores of the ocean. In the public</a>
<a id='line_753'>      danger he was summoned by the voice of his country; and his</a>
<a id='line_754'>      rival, the duke of Aquitain, was reduced to appear among the</a>
<a id='line_755'>      fugitives and suppliants. “Alas!” exclaimed the Franks, “what a</a>
<a id='line_756'>      misfortune! what an indignity! We have long heard of the name and</a>
<a id='line_757'>      conquests of the Arabs: we were apprehensive of their attack from</a>
<a id='line_758'>      the East; they have now conquered Spain, and invade our country</a>
<a id='line_759'>      on the side of the West. Yet their numbers, and (since they have</a>
<a id='line_760'>      no buckler) their arms, are inferior to our own.” “If you follow</a>
<a id='line_761'>      my advice,” replied the prudent mayor of the palace, “you will</a>
<a id='line_762'>      not interrupt their march, nor precipitate your attack. They are</a>
<a id='line_763'>      like a torrent, which it is dangerous to stem in its career. The</a>
<a id='line_764'>      thirst of riches, and the consciousness of success, redouble</a>
<a id='line_765'>      their valor, and valor is of more avail than arms or numbers. Be</a>
<a id='line_766'>      patient till they have loaded themselves with the encumbrance of</a>
<a id='line_767'>      wealth. The possession of wealth will divide their councils and</a>
<a id='line_768'>      assure your victory.” This subtile policy is perhaps a refinement</a>
<a id='line_769'>      of the Arabian writers; and the situation of Charles will suggest</a>
<a id='line_770'>      a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination—the secret</a>
<a id='line_771'>      desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the</a>
<a id='line_772'>      rebel duke of Aquitain. It is yet more probable, that the delays</a>
<a id='line_773'>      of Charles were inevitable and reluctant. A standing army was</a>
<a id='line_774'>      unknown under the first and second race; more than half the</a>
<a id='line_775'>      kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens: according to their</a>
<a id='line_776'>      respective situation, the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were</a>
<a id='line_777'>      to conscious or too careless of the impending danger; and the</a>
<a id='line_778'>      voluntary aids of the Gepidae and Germans were separated by a</a>
<a id='line_779'>      long interval from the standard of the Christian general. No</a>
<a id='line_780'>      sooner had he collected his forces, than he sought and found the</a>
<a id='line_781'>      enemy in the centre of France, between Tours and Poitiers. His</a>
<a id='line_782'>      well-conducted march was covered with a range of hills, and</a>
<a id='line_783'>      Abderame appears to have been surprised by his unexpected</a>
<a id='line_784'>      presence. The nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe, advanced with</a>
<a id='line_785'>      equal ardor to an encounter which would change the history of the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      world. In the six first days of desultory combat, the horsemen</a>
<a id='line_787'>      and archers of the East maintained their advantage: but in the</a>
<a id='line_788'>      closer onset of the seventh day, the Orientals were oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_789'>      the strength and stature of the Germans, who, with stout hearts</a>
<a id='line_790'>      and iron hands, 31 asserted the civil and religious freedom of</a>
<a id='line_791'>      their posterity. The epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has</a>
<a id='line_792'>      been added to the name of Charles, is expressive of his weighty</a>
<a id='line_793'>      and irresistible strokes: the valor of Eudes was excited by</a>
<a id='line_794'>      resentment and emulation; and their companions, in the eye of</a>
<a id='line_795'>      history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry.</a>
<a id='line_796'>      After a bloody field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens,</a>
<a id='line_797'>      in the close of the evening, retired to their camp. In the</a>
<a id='line_798'>      disorder and despair of the night, the various tribes of Yemen</a>
<a id='line_799'>      and Damascus, of Africa and Spain, were provoked to turn their</a>
<a id='line_800'>      arms against each other: the remains of their host were suddenly</a>
<a id='line_801'>      dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and</a>
<a id='line_802'>      separate retreat. At the dawn of the day, the stillness of a</a>
<a id='line_803'>      hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians: on the</a>
<a id='line_804'>      report of their spies, they ventured to explore the riches of the</a>
<a id='line_805'>      vacant tents; but if we except some celebrated relics, a small</a>
<a id='line_806'>      portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful</a>
<a id='line_807'>      owners. The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_808'>      world, and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three</a>
<a id='line_809'>      hundred and fifty, or three hundred and seventy-five, thousand of</a>
<a id='line_810'>      the Mahometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles, 32</a>
<a id='line_811'>      while no more than fifteen hundred Christians were slain in the</a>
<a id='line_812'>      field of Tours. But this incredible tale is sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_813'>      disproved by the caution of the French general, who apprehended</a>
<a id='line_814'>      the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German</a>
<a id='line_815'>      allies to their native forests.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>      The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and</a>
<a id='line_818'>      blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the</a>
<a id='line_819'>      ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_820'>      victory of the Franks was complete and final; Aquitain was</a>
<a id='line_821'>      recovered by the arms of Eudes; the Arabs never resumed the</a>
<a id='line_822'>      conquest of Gaul, and they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees</a>
<a id='line_823'>      by Charles Martel and his valiant race. 33 It might have been</a>
<a id='line_824'>      expected that the savior of Christendom would have been</a>
<a id='line_825'>      canonized, or at least applauded, by the gratitude of the clergy,</a>

<a id='line_869'>      The loss of an army, or a province, in the Western world, was</a>
<a id='line_870'>      less painful to the court of Damascus, than the rise and progress</a>
<a id='line_871'>      of a domestic competitor. Except among the Syrians, the caliphs</a>
<a id='line_872'>      of the house of Ommiyah had never been the objects of the public</a>

<a id='line_874'>      idolatry and rebellion: their conversion had been reluctant,</a>
<a id='line_875'>      their elevation irregular and factious, and their throne was</a>
<a id='line_876'>      cemented with the most holy and noble blood of Arabia. The best</a>
<a id='line_877'>      of their race, the pious Omar, was dissatisfied with his own</a>
<a id='line_878'>      title: their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a</a>
<a id='line_879'>      departure from the order of succession; and the eyes and wishes</a>
<a id='line_880'>      of the faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem, and the</a>
<a id='line_881'>      kindred of the apostle of God. Of these the Fatimites were either</a>
<a id='line_882'>      rash or pusillanimous; but the descendants of Abbas cherished,</a>
<a id='line_883'>      with courage and discretion, the hopes of their rising fortunes.</a>

<a id='line_885'>      their agents and missionaries, who preached in the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_886'>      provinces their hereditary indefeasible right; and Mohammed, the</a>
<a id='line_887'>      son of Ali, the son of Abdallah, the son of Abbas, the uncle of</a>
<a id='line_888'>      the prophet, gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan, and</a>

<a id='line_891'>      administered in the name of his son Ibrahim to a numerous band of</a>
<a id='line_892'>      votaries, who expected only a signal and a leader; and the</a>
<a id='line_893'>      governor of Chorasan continued to deplore his fruitless</a>
<a id='line_894'>      admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus,</a>
<a id='line_895'>      till he himself, with all his adherents, was driven from the city</a>
<a id='line_896'>      and palace of Meru, by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem. 35 That</a>
<a id='line_897'>      maker of kings, the author, as he is named, of the call of the</a>
<a id='line_898'>      Abbassides, was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit</a>
<a id='line_899'>      with the usual gratitude of courts. A mean, perhaps a foreign,</a>
<a id='line_900'>      extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem.</a>
<a id='line_901'>      Jealous of his wives, liberal of his wealth, prodigal of his own</a>
<a id='line_902'>      blood and of that of others, he could boast with pleasure, and</a>
<a id='line_903'>      possibly with truth, that he had destroyed six hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_904'>      of his enemies; and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and</a>
<a id='line_905'>      countenance, that he was never seen to smile except on a day of</a>
<a id='line_906'>      battle. In the visible separation of parties, the green was</a>
<a id='line_907'>      consecrated to the Fatimites; the Ommiades were distinguished by</a>
<a id='line_908'>      the white; and the black, as the most adverse, was naturally</a>
<a id='line_909'>      adopted by the Abbassides. Their turbans and garments were</a>
<a id='line_910'>      stained with that gloomy color: two black standards, on pike</a>
<a id='line_911'>      staves nine cubits long, were borne aloft in the van of Abu</a>
<a id='line_912'>      Moslem; and their allegorical names of the night and the shadow</a>
<a id='line_913'>      obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual</a>
<a id='line_914'>      succession of the line of Hashem. From the Indus to the</a>
<a id='line_915'>      Euphrates, the East was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and</a>
<a id='line_916'>      the black factions: the Abbassides were most frequently</a>
<a id='line_917'>      victorious; but their public success was clouded by the personal</a>
<a id='line_918'>      misfortune of their chief. The court of Damascus, awakening from</a>
<a id='line_919'>      a long slumber, resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca,</a>
<a id='line_920'>      which Ibrahim had undertaken with a splendid retinue, to</a>
<a id='line_921'>      recommend himself at once to the favor of the prophet and of the</a>
<a id='line_922'>      people. A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and</a>
<a id='line_923'>      arrested his person; and the unhappy Ibrahim, snatched away from</a>
<a id='line_924'>      the promise of untasted royalty, expired in iron fetters in the</a>
<a id='line_925'>      dungeons of Haran. His two younger brothers, Saffah 3511 and</a>
<a id='line_926'>      Almansor, eluded the search of the tyrant, and lay concealed at</a>
<a id='line_927'>      Cufa, till the zeal of the people and the approach of his Eastern</a>
<a id='line_928'>      friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient</a>
<a id='line_929'>      public. On Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the colors of the</a>
<a id='line_930'>      sect, Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp to the</a>
<a id='line_931'>      mosch: ascending the pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful</a>
<a id='line_932'>      successor of Mahomet; and after his departure, his kinsmen bound</a>
<a id='line_933'>      a willing people by an oath of fidelity. But it was on the banks</a>
<a id='line_934'>      of the Zab, and not in the mosch of Cufa, that this important</a>
<a id='line_935'>      controversy was determined. Every advantage appeared to be on the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      side of the white faction: the authority of established</a>
<a id='line_937'>      government; an army of a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_938'>      against a sixth part of that number; and the presence and merit</a>
<a id='line_939'>      of the caliph Mervan, the fourteenth and last of the house of</a>
<a id='line_940'>      Ommiyah. Before his accession to the throne, he had deserved, by</a>
<a id='line_941'>      his Georgian warfare, the honorable epithet of the ass of</a>
<a id='line_942'>      Mesopotamia; 36 and he might have been ranked amongst the</a>
<a id='line_943'>      greatest princes, had not, says Abulfeda, the eternal order</a>
<a id='line_944'>      decreed that moment for the ruin of his family; a decree against</a>
<a id='line_945'>      which all human fortitude and prudence must struggle in vain. The</a>
<a id='line_946'>      orders of Mervan were mistaken, or disobeyed: the return of his</a>
<a id='line_947'>      horse, from which he had dismounted on a necessary occasion,</a>
<a id='line_948'>      impressed the belief of his death; and the enthusiasm of the</a>
<a id='line_949'>      black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, the uncle of his</a>
<a id='line_950'>      competitor. After an irretrievab defeat, the caliph escaped to</a>
<a id='line_951'>      Mosul; but the colors of the Abbassides were displayed from the</a>
<a id='line_952'>      rampart; he suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy look</a>
<a id='line_953'>      on his palace of Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the</a>
<a id='line_954'>      fortifications of Damascus, and, without halting in Palestine,</a>
<a id='line_955'>      pitched his last and fatal camp at Busir, on the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_956'>      Nile. 37 His speed was urged by the incessant diligence of</a>
<a id='line_957'>      Abdallah, who in every step of the pursuit acquired strength and</a>
<a id='line_958'>      reputation: the remains of the white faction were finally</a>
<a id='line_959'>      vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which terminated the life and</a>
<a id='line_960'>      anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps to the</a>
<a id='line_961'>      unfortunate than to the victorious chief. The merciless</a>
<a id='line_962'>      inquisition of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches</a>
<a id='line_963'>      of the hostile race: their bones were scattered, their memory was</a>
<a id='line_964'>      accursed, and the martyrdom of Hossein was abundantly revenged on</a>
<a id='line_965'>      the posterity of his tyrants. Fourscore of the Ommiades, who had</a>
<a id='line_966'>      yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes, were invited to a</a>
<a id='line_967'>      banquet at Damascus. The laws of hospitality were violated by a</a>
<a id='line_968'>      promiscuous massacre: the board was spread over their fallen</a>
<a id='line_969'>      bodies; and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the</a>
<a id='line_970'>      music of their dying groans. By the event of the civil war, the</a>
<a id='line_971'>      dynasty of the Abbassides was firmly established; but the</a>
<a id='line_972'>      Christians only could triumph in the mutual hatred and common</a>

<a id='line_1090'>      and frugality of the first caliphs, and aspired to emulate the</a>
<a id='line_1091'>      magnificence of the Persian kings. After his wars and buildings,</a>

<a id='line_1120'>      thousand pieces of tapestry, twelve thousand five hundred of</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      which were of silk embroidered with gold. The carpets on the</a>

<a id='line_1225'>      obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts and the cares of</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      royalty. It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps excited</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. “I have now</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies.</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      Riches and honors, power and pleasure, have waited on my call,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      amount to Fourteen:—O man! place not thy confidence in this</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      present world!” 50 The luxury of the caliphs, so useless to their</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      private happiness, relaxed the nerves, and terminated the</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      progress, of the Arabian empire. Temporal and spiritual conquest</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      had been the sole occupation of the first successors of Mahomet;</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life, the</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work. The</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      Abbassides were impoverished by the multitude of their wants, and</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      their contempt of oeconomy. Instead of pursuing the great object</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      of ambition, their leisure, their affections, the powers of their</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      mind, were diverted by pomp and pleasure: the rewards of valor</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      were embezzled by women and eunuchs, and the royal camp was</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      encumbered by the luxury of the palace. A similar temper was</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      diffused among the subjects of the caliph. Their stern enthusiasm</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      was softened by time and prosperity. they sought riches in the</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      occupations of industry, fame in the pursuits of literature, and</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life. War was no longer</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      the passion of the Saracens; and the increase of pay, the</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      repetition of donatives, were insufficient to allure the</a>

<a id='line_1276'>      Arabia murmured a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      them of the greatest part of their practice. 51 After their civil</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      and domestic wars, the subjects of the Abbassides, awakening from</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      this mental lethargy, found leisure and felt curiosity for the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      acquisition of profane science. This spirit was first encouraged</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      by the caliph Almansor, who, besides his knowledge of the</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      Mahometan law, had applied himself with success to the study of</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      astronomy. But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon, the seventh</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      of the Abbassides, he completed the designs of his grandfather,</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      and invited the muses from their ancient seats. His ambassadors</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      at Constantinople, his agents in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      collected the volumes of Grecian science; at his command they</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      were translated by the most skilful interpreters into the Arabic</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      language: his subjects were exhorted assiduously to peruse these</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      instructive writings; and the successor of Mahomet assisted with</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      pleasure and modesty at the assemblies and disputations of the</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      learned. “He was not ignorant,” says Abulpharagius, “that they</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      are the elect of God, his best and most useful servants, whose</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      lives are devoted to the improvement of their rational faculties.</a>

<a id='line_1304'>      sink in ignorance and barbarism.” 53 The zeal and curiosity of</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      Almamon were imitated by succeeding princes of the line of Abbas:</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      their rivals, the Fatimites of Africa and the Ommiades of Spain,</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      were the patrons of the learned, as well as the commanders of the</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      faithful; the same royal prerogative was claimed by their</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      independent emirs of the provinces; and their emulation diffused</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      the taste and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      to Fez and Cordova. The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      two hundred thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      college at Bagdad, which he endowed with an annual revenue of</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      fifteen thousand dinars. The fruits of instruction were</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      communicated, perhaps at different times, to six thousand</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      disciples of every degree, from the son of the noble to that of</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      the mechanic: a sufficient allowance was provided for the</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      indigent scholars; and the merit or industry of the professors</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      was repaid with adequate stipends. In every city the productions</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      of Arabic literature were copied and collected by the curiosity</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      of the studious and the vanity of the rich. A private doctor</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      refused the invitation of the sultan of Bochara, because the</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      carriage of his books would have required four hundred camels.</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one hundred</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      thousand manuscripts, elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound,</a>

<a id='line_1385'>      speculation or science may be reduced to the four classes of</a>

<a id='line_1389'>      in the versions of the East, 56 which possessed and studied the</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      writings of Aristotle and Plato, of Euclid and Apollonius, of</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen. 57 Among the ideal systems which</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      have varied with the fashion of the times, the Arabians adopted</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      the philosophy of the Stagirite, alike intelligible or alike</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      obscure for the readers of every age. Plato wrote for the</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      Athenians, and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      the language and religion of Greece. After the fall of that</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      religion, the Peripatetics, emerging from their obscurity,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      prevailed in the controversies of the Oriental sects, and their</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      founder was long afterwards restored by the Mahometans of Spain</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      to the Latin schools. 58 The physics, both of the Academy and the</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      Lycaeum, as they are built, not on observation, but on argument,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      have retarded the progress of real knowledge. The metaphysics of</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      infinite, or finite, spirit, have too often been enlisted in the</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      service of superstition. But the human faculties are fortified by</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      the art and practice of dialectics; the ten predicaments of</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      Aristotle collect and methodize our ideas, 59 and his syllogism</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      is the keenest weapon of dispute. It was dexterously wielded in</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      the schools of the Saracens, but as it is more effectual for the</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      detection of error than for the investigation of truth, it is not</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      still revolve in the same circle of logical argument. The</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege, that, in</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      the course of ages, they may always advance, and can never</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      recede. But the ancient geometry, if I am not misinformed, was</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      resumed in the same state by the Italians of the fifteenth</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      century; and whatever may be the origin of the name, the science</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      of algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      testimony of the Arabs themselves. 60 They cultivated with more</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      success the sublime science of astronomy, which elevates the mind</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      of man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence.</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      The costly instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      Almamon, and the land of the Chaldaeans still afforded the same</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      spacious level, the same unclouded horizon. In the plains of</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      Sinaar, and a second time in those of Cufa, his mathematicians</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth,</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      and determined at twenty-four thousand miles the entire</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      circumference of our globe. 61 From the reign of the Abbassides</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane, the stars, without the</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      aid of glasses, were diligently observed; and the astronomical</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      tables of Bagdad, Spain, and Samarcand, 62 correct some minute</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      errors, without daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy,</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      without advancing a step towards the discovery of the solar</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      system. In the Eastern courts, the truths of science could be</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      recommended only by ignorance and folly, and the astronomer would</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      have been disregarded, had he not debased his wisdom or honesty</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      by the vain predictions of astrology. 63 But in the science of</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      medicine, the Arabians have been deservedly applauded. The names</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      of Mesua and Geber, of Razis and Avicenna, are ranked with the</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      Grecian masters; in the city of Bagdad, eight hundred and sixty</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession:</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      64 in Spain, the life of the Catholic princes was intrusted to</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      the skill of the Saracens, 65 and the school of Salerno, their</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      legitimate offspring, revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      the healing art. 66 The success of each professor must have been</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      influenced by personal and accidental causes; but we may form a</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy, 67</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      botany, 68 and chemistry, 69 the threefold basis of their theory</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      and practice. A superstitious reverence for the dead confined</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      both the Greeks and the Arabians to the dissection of apes and</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      quadrupeds; the more solid and visible parts were known in the</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      time of Galen, and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists.</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      Botany is an active science, and the discoveries of the torrid</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      zone might enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      plants. Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      temples and monasteries of Egypt; much useful experience had been</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures; but the</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      industry of the Saracens. They first invented and named the</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      alembic for the purposes of distillation, analyzed the substances</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      affinities of alcalis and acids, and converted the poisonous</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      minerals into soft and salutary medicines. But the most eager</a>

<a id='line_1698'>      the feeble arms of the Greeks, without turning the edge, or</a>

<a id='line_1723'>      the Pontic Heraclea, 77 once a flourishing state, now a paltry</a>

<a id='line_1944'>      aggravation from the death of their spiritual and temporal chief;</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      but the pressing emergency superseded the forms and intrigues of</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      an election; and the unanimous choice of Pope Leo the Fourth 87</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      was the safety of the church and city. This pontiff was born a</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      Roman; the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      his breast; and, amidst the ruins of his country, he stood erect,</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      like one of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      above the fragments of the Roman forum. The first days of his</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      reign were consecrated to the purification and removal of relics,</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      to prayers and processions, and to all the solemn offices of</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      religion, which served at least to heal the imagination, and</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      restore the hopes, of the multitude. The public defence had been</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      long neglected, not from the presumption of peace, but from the</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      distress and poverty of the times. As far as the scantiness of</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow, the</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo; fifteen</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      towers, in the most accessible stations, were built or renewed;</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      two of these commanded on either side of the Tyber; and an iron</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent of a</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      hostile navy. The Romans were assured of a short respite by the</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      welcome news, that the siege of Gayeta had been raised, and that</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      a part of the enemy, with their sacrilegious plunder, had</a>

<a id='line_1981'>      But the storm, which had been delayed, soon burst upon them with</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      redoubled violence. The Aglabite, 88 who reigned in Africa, had</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      inherited from his father a treasure and an army: a fleet of</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      Arabs and Moors, after a short refreshment in the harbors of</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      Sardinia, cast anchor before the mouth of the Tyber, sixteen</a>

<a id='line_1987'>      threaten, not a transient inroad, but a serious design of</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      conquest and dominion. But the vigilance of Leo had formed an</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire, the free and</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      maritime states of Gayeta, Naples, and Amalfi; and in the hour of</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      danger, their galleys appeared in the port of Ostia under the</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      command of Caesarius, the son of the Neapolitan duke, a noble and</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      valiant youth, who had already vanquished the fleets of the</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      Saracens. With his principal companions, Caesarius was invited to</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      the Lateran palace, and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      their errand, and to accept with joy and surprise their</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      providential succor. The city bands, in arms, attended their</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      father to Ostia, where he reviewed and blessed his generous</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      deliverers. They kissed his feet, received the communion with</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      martial devotion, and listened to the prayer of Leo, that the</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      same God who had supported St. Peter and St. Paul on the waves of</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      the sea, would strengthen the hands of his champions against the</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      adversaries of his holy name. After a similar prayer, and with</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      equal resolution, the Moslems advanced to the attack of the</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      Christian galleys, which preserved their advantageous station</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      along the coast. The victory inclined to the side of the allies,</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      when it was less gloriously decided in their favor by a sudden</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      tempest, which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      mariners. The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbor,</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      rocks and islands of a hostile shore. Those who escaped from</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      shipwreck and hunger neither found, nor deserved, mercy at the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      hands of their implacable pursuers. The sword and the gibbet</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      reduced the dangerous multitude of captives; and the remainder</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      was more usefully employed, to restore the sacred edifices which</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      they had attempted to subvert. The pontiff, at the head of the</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      citizens and allies, paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      the apostles; and, among the spoils of this naval victory,</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee. The reign of Leo the</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      state. The churches were renewed and embellished: near four</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      of St. Peter; and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      gold of the weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds, embossed</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      with the portraits of the pope and emperor, and encircled with a</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      string of pearls. Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      on the character of Leo than the paternal care with which he</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria; and transported the</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      wandering inhabitants of Centumcellae to his new foundation of</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      Leopolis, twelve miles from the sea-shore. 89 By his liberality,</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      a colony of Corsicans, with their wives and children, was planted</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      in the station of Porto, at the mouth of the Tyber: the falling</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      city was restored for their use, the fields and vineyards were</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      divided among the new settlers: their first efforts were assisted</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      by a gift of horses and cattle; and the hardy exiles, who</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      breathed revenge against the Saracens, swore to live and die</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      under the standard of St. Peter. The nations of the West and</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      North who visited the threshold of the apostles had gradually</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican, and their</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      various habitations were distinguished, in the language of the</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      times, as the schools of the Greeks and Goths, of the Lombards</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      and Saxons. But this venerable spot was still open to</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      sacrilegious insult: the design of enclosing it with walls and</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      towers exhausted all that authority could command, or charity</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      would supply: and the pious labor of four years was animated in</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      every season, and at every hour, by the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      indefatigable pontiff. The love of fame, a generous but worldly</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      passion, may be detected in the name of the Leonine city, which</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      he bestowed on the Vatican; yet the pride of the dedication was</a>

<a id='line_2054'>      litanies; the walls were besprinkled with holy water; and the</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      ceremony was concluded with a prayer, that, under the guardian</a>

<a id='line_2080'>      The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Stammerer, was one of</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      the most active and high-spirited princes who reigned at</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      Constantinople during the middle age. In offensive or defensive</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      war, he marched in person five times against the Saracens,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      formidable in his attack, esteemed by the enemy in his losses and</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      defeats. In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      Syria, and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra; the casual</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father Harun was</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      attended in peace or war by the most favored of his wives and</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      concubines. The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      moment the arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede in</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      favor of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      of filial affection. These solicitations determined the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      to wound his pride in so sensible a part. Sozopetra was levelled</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      with the ground, the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      with ignominious cruelty, and a thousand female captives were</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      forced away from the adjacent territory. Among these a matron of</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of despair, the name of</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      Motassem; and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honor of her</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      kinsman to avenge his indignity, and to answer her appeal. Under</a>
<a id='line_2100'>      the reign of the two elder brothers, the inheritance of the</a>
<a id='line_2101'>      youngest had been confined to Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      Circassia; this frontier station had exercised his military</a>
<a id='line_2103'>      talents; and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary,</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      91 the most meritorious are the eight battles which he gained or</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      fought against the enemies of the Koran. In this personal</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      quarrel, the troops of Irak, Syria, and Egypt, were recruited</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      from the tribes of Arabia and the Turkish hordes; his cavalry</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      might be numerous, though we should deduct some myriads from the</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables; and the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      expense of the armament was computed at four millions sterling,</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      or one hundred thousand pounds of gold. From Tarsus, the place of</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      assembly, the Saracens advanced in three divisions along the high</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      road of Constantinople: Motassem himself commanded the centre,</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas, who, in the trial of</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      the first adventures, might succeed with the more glory, or fail</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      with the least reproach. In the revenge of his injury, the caliph</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      prepared to retaliate a similar affront. The father of Theophilus</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      was a native of Amorium 92 in Phrygia: the original seat of the</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      Imperial house had been adorned with privileges and monuments;</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      and, whatever might be the indifference of the people,</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      Constantinople itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      the sovereign and his court. The name of Amorium was inscribed on</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      the shields of the Saracens; and their three armies were again</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      united under the walls of the devoted city. It had been proposed</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      by the wisest counsellors, to evacuate Amorium, to remove the</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      inhabitants, and to abandon the empty structures to the vain</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      resentment of the Barbarians. The emperor embraced the more</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      generous resolution of defending, in a siege and battle, the</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      country of his ancestors. When the armies drew near, the front of</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      the Mahometan line appeared to a Roman eye more closely planted</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      with spears and javelins; but the event of the action was not</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      glorious on either side to the national troops. The Arabs were</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      broken, but it was by the swords of thirty thousand Persians, who</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      had obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine empire. The</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      Greeks were repulsed and vanquished, but it was by the arrows of</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      the Turkish cavalry; and had not their bowstrings been damped and</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      relaxed by the evening rain, very few of the Christians could</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle. They</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      breathed at Dorylaeum, at the distance of three days; and</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      Theophilus, reviewing his trembling squadrons, forgave the common</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      flight both of the prince and people. After this discovery of his</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      weakness, he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      promises; and detained the Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      of his great revenge. They had nearly been the witnesses of his</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      shame. The vigorous assaults of fifty-five days were encountered</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      by a faithful governor, a veteran garrison, and a desperate</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      people; and the Saracens must have raised the siege, if a</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall,</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a</a>
<a id='line_2151'>      bull. The vow of Motassem was accomplished with unrelenting</a>
<a id='line_2152'>      rigor: tired, rather than satiated, with destruction, he returned</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      to his new palace of Samara, in the neighborhood of Bagdad, while</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      the unfortunate 93 Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      of his Western rival the emperor of the Franks. Yet in the siege</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      of Amorium about seventy thousand Moslems had perished: their</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      loss had been revenged by the slaughter of thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      Christians, and the sufferings of an equal number of captives,</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      who were treated as the most atrocious criminals. Mutual</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      prisoners: 94 but in the national and religious conflict of the</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      two empires, peace was without confidence, and war without mercy.</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      Quarter was seldom given in the field; those who escaped the edge</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      of the sword were condemned to hopeless servitude, or exquisite</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      torture; and a Catholic emperor relates, with visible</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      satisfaction, the execution of the Saracens of Crete, who were</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      flayed alive, or plunged into caldrons of boiling oil. 95 To a</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      point of honor Motassem had sacrificed a flourishing city, two</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      hundred thousand lives, and the property of millions. The same</a>

<a id='line_2323'>      timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect; and the</a>
<a id='line_2324'>      name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been</a>
<a id='line_2325'>      withdrawn from the world. His twelve apostles dispersed</a>

<a id='line_2327'>      “equally devoid of reason and of religion;” and the success of</a>
<a id='line_2328'>      their preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution.</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      The Carmathians were ripe for rebellion, since they disclaimed</a>
<a id='line_2330'>      the title of the house of Abbas, and abhorred the worldly pomp of</a>
<a id='line_2331'>      the caliphs of Bagdad. They were susceptible of discipline, since</a>
<a id='line_2332'>      they vowed a blind and absolute submission to their Imam, who was</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      called to the prophetic office by the voice of God and the</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      people. Instead of the legal tithes, he claimed the fifth of</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      their substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no more</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were united and</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      concealed by an oath of secrecy. After a bloody conflict, they</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      prevailed in the province of Bahrein, along the Persian Gulf: far</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      and wide, the tribes of the desert were subject to the sceptre,</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      or rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher; and</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      these rebellious imams could muster in the field a hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      seven thousand fanatics. The mercenaries of the caliph were</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      accepted quarter; and the difference between, them in fortitude</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      and patience, is expressive of the change which three centuries</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      of prosperity had effected in the character of the Arabians. Such</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      troops were discomfited in every action; the cities of Racca and</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      Baalbec, of Cufa and Bassora, were taken and pillaged; Bagdad was</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      filled with consternation; and the caliph trembled behind the</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      veils of his palace. In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris, Abu</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      Taher advanced to the gates of the capital with no more than five</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      hundred horse. By the special order of Moctader, the bridges had</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      been broken down, and the person or head of the rebel was</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      expected every hour by the commander of the faithful. His</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      lieutenant, from a motive of fear or pity, apprised Abu Taher of</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      his danger, and recommended a speedy escape. “Your master,” said</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger, “is at the head of</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      thirty thousand soldiers: three such men as these are wanting in</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      his host:” at the same instant, turning to three of his</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      companions, he commanded the first to plunge a dagger into his</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      breast, the second to leap into the Tigris, and the third to cast</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      himself headlong down a precipice. They obeyed without a murmur.</a>
<a id='line_2363'></a>
<a id='line_2364'>      “Relate,” continued the imam, “what you have seen: before the</a>
<a id='line_2365'>      evening your general shall be chained among my dogs.” Before the</a>
<a id='line_2366'>      evening, the camp was surprised, and the menace was executed. The</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      rapine of the Carmathians was sanctified by their aversion to the</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      worship of Mecca: they robbed a caravan of pilgrims, and twenty</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning sands to a</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      death of hunger and thirst. Another year they suffered the</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      pilgrims to proceed without interruption; but, in the festival of</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      devotion, Abu Taher stormed the holy city, and trampled on the</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      most venerable relics of the Mahometan faith. Thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      citizens and strangers were put to the sword; the sacred</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      precincts were polluted by the burial of three thousand dead</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      bodies; the well of Zemzem overflowed with blood; the golden</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      spout was forced from its place; the veil of the Caaba was</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      divided among these impious sectaries; and the black stone, the</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      first monument of the nation, was borne away in triumph to their</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      capital. After this deed of sacrilege and cruelty, they continued</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      to infest the confines of Irak, Syria, and Egypt: but the vital</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root. Their scruples,</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      or their avarice, again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca, and</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      restored the black stone of the Caaba; and it is needless to</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      inquire into what factions they were broken, or by whose swords</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      they were finally extirpated. The sect of the Carmathians may be</a>

<a id='line_2714'>      conquests of the two emperors from the hills of Cappadocia to the</a>
<a id='line_2715'>      desert of Bagdad. The sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, in</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      Cilicia, first exercised the skill and perseverance of their</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      troops, on whom, at this moment, I shall not hesitate to bestow</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      the name of Romans. In the double city of Mopsuestia, which is</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      divided by the River Sarus, two hundred thousand Moslems were</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      predestined to death or slavery, 115 a surprising degree of</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      population, which must at least include the inhabitants of the</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      dependent districts. They were surrounded and taken by assault;</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      but Tarsus was reduced by the slow progress of famine; and no</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      sooner had the Saracens yielded on honorable terms than they were</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      mortified by the distant and unprofitable view of the naval</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      succors of Egypt. They were dismissed with a safe-conduct to the</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      confines of Syria: a part of the old Christians had quietly lived</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      under their dominion; and the vacant habitations were replenished</a>
<a id='line_2729'>      by a new colony. But the mosch was converted into a stable; the</a>
<a id='line_2730'>      pulpit was delivered to the flames; many rich crosses of gold and</a>
<a id='line_2731'>      gems, the spoils of Asiatic churches, were made a grateful</a>
<a id='line_2732'>      offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor; and he</a>
<a id='line_2733'>      transported the gates of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, which were fixed</a>
<a id='line_2734'>      in the walls of Constantinople, an eternal monument of his</a>
<a id='line_2735'>      victory. After they had forced and secured the narrow passes of</a>
<a id='line_2736'>      Mount Amanus, the two Roman princes repeatedly carried their arms</a>
<a id='line_2737'>      into the heart of Syria. Yet, instead of assaulting the walls of</a>
<a id='line_2738'>      Antioch, the humanity or superstition of Nicephorus appeared to</a>
<a id='line_2739'>      respect the ancient metropolis of the East: he contented himself</a>
<a id='line_2740'>      with drawing round the city a line of circumvallation; left a</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      stationary army; and instructed his lieutenant to expect, without</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      impatience, the return of spring. But in the depth of winter, in</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      a dark and rainy night, an adventurous subaltern, with three</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      hundred soldiers, approached the rampart, applied his</a>
<a id='line_2745'>      scaling-ladders, occupied two adjacent towers, stood firm against</a>
<a id='line_2746'>      the pressure of multitudes, and bravely maintained his post till</a>
<a id='line_2747'>      he was relieved by the tardy, though effectual, support of his</a>
<a id='line_2748'>      reluctant chief. The first tumult of slaughter and rapine</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      subsided; the reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored; and the</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      efforts of a hundred thousand Saracens, of the armies of Syria</a>
<a id='line_2751'>      and the fleets of Africa, were consumed without effect before the</a>
<a id='line_2752'>      walls of Antioch. The royal city of Aleppo was subject to</a>
<a id='line_2753'>      Seifeddowlat, of the dynasty of Hamadan, who clouded his past</a>
<a id='line_2754'>      glory by the precipitate retreat which abandoned his kingdom and</a>
<a id='line_2755'>      capital to the Roman invaders. In his stately palace, that stood</a>
<a id='line_2756'>      without the walls of Aleppo, they joyfully seized a</a>
<a id='line_2757'>      well-furnished magazine of arms, a stable of fourteen hundred</a>
<a id='line_2758'>      mules, and three hundred bags of silver and gold. But the walls</a>
<a id='line_2759'>      of the city withstood the strokes of their battering-rams: and</a>
<a id='line_2760'>      the besiegers pitched their tents on the neighboring mountain of</a>
<a id='line_2761'>      Jaushan. Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen</a>
<a id='line_2762'>      and mercenaries; the guard of the gates and ramparts was</a>
<a id='line_2763'>      deserted; and while they furiously charged each other in the</a>
<a id='line_2764'>      market-place, they were surprised and destroyed by the sword of a</a>
<a id='line_2765'>      common enemy. The male sex was exterminated by the sword; ten</a>
<a id='line_2766'>      thousand youths were led into captivity; the weight of the</a>
<a id='line_2767'>      precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the beasts of</a>
<a id='line_2768'>      burden; the superfluous remainder was burnt; and, after a</a>
<a id='line_2769'>      licentious possession of ten days, the Romans marched away from</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      the naked and bleeding city. In their Syrian inroads they</a>
<a id='line_2771'>      commanded the husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they</a>
<a id='line_2772'>      themselves, in the ensuing season, might reap the benefit; more</a>
<a id='line_2773'>      than a hundred cities were reduced to obedience; and eighteen</a>
<a id='line_2774'>      pulpits of the principal moschs were committed to the flames to</a>
<a id='line_2775'>      expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of Mahomet. The classic</a>
<a id='line_2776'>      names of Hierapolis, Apamea, and Emesa, revive for a moment in</a>
<a id='line_2777'>      the list of conquest: the emperor Zimisces encamped in the</a>
<a id='line_2778'>      paradise of Damascus, and accepted the ransom of a submissive</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      people; and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnable</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      fortress of Tripoli, on the sea-coast of Phoenicia. Since the</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      days of Heraclius, the Euphrates, below the passage of Mount</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      Taurus, had been impervious, and almost invisible, to the Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_2783'></a>
<a id='line_2784'>      The river yielded a free passage to the victorious Zimisces; and</a>
<a id='line_2785'>      the historian may imitate the speed with which he overran the</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      once famous cities of Samosata, Edessa, Martyropolis, Amida, 116</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      and Nisibis, the ancient limit of the empire in the neighborhood</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      of the Tigris. His ardor was quickened by the desire of grasping</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      the virgin treasures of Ecbatana, 117 a well-known name, under</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      which the Byzantine writer has concealed the capital of the</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      Abbassides. The consternation of the fugitives had already</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      diffused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of Bagdad</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      had already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      domestic tyrants. The prayers of the people, and the stern</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the caliph to</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      provide for the defence of the city. The helpless Mothi replied,</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      that his arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      from his hands, and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      he was unable to support. The emir was inexorable; the furniture</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      of the palace was sold; and the paltry price of forty thousand</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury. But the</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      apprehensions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      Greeks: thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia; and</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with Oriental spoils,</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his triumph, the</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      silk, the aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      silver. Yet the powers of the East had been bent, not broken, by</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      this transient hurricane. After the departure of the Greeks, the</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      fugitive princes returned to their capitals; the subjects</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; the Moslems</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      again purified their temples, and overturned the idols of the</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      saints and martyrs; the Nestorians and Jacobites preferred a</a>
