                    <a id='line_0'>The Revelation of Saint John the Devine</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew</a>
<a id='line_4'>unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent</a>
<a id='line_5'>and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 1:2 Who bare</a>
<a id='line_6'>record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and</a>
<a id='line_7'>of all things that he saw.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this</a>
<a id='line_10'>prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the</a>
<a id='line_11'>time is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you,</a>
<a id='line_14'>and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and</a>
<a id='line_15'>from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 1:5 And from Jesus</a>
<a id='line_16'>Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved</a>
<a id='line_18'>us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 1:6 And hath made us</a>
<a id='line_19'>kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and</a>
<a id='line_20'>dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and</a>
<a id='line_23'>they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail</a>
<a id='line_24'>because of him. Even so, Amen.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the</a>
<a id='line_27'>Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:9 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,</a>
<a id='line_30'>and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that</a>
<a id='line_31'>is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus</a>
<a id='line_32'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a</a>
<a id='line_35'>great voice, as of a trumpet, 1:11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the</a>
<a id='line_36'>first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it</a>
<a id='line_37'>unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto</a>
<a id='line_38'>Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and</a>
<a id='line_39'>unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:12 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being</a>
<a id='line_42'>turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 1:13 And in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_43'>seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a</a>
<a id='line_44'>garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden</a>
<a id='line_45'>girdle.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:14 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;</a>
<a id='line_48'>and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 1:15 And his feet like unto fine</a>
<a id='line_49'>brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of</a>
<a id='line_50'>many waters.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:16 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth</a>
<a id='line_53'>went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun</a>
<a id='line_54'>shineth in his strength.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his</a>
<a id='line_57'>right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the</a>
<a id='line_58'>last: 1:18 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive</a>
<a id='line_59'>for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:19 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,</a>
<a id='line_62'>and the things which shall be hereafter; 1:20 The mystery of the seven</a>
<a id='line_63'>stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden</a>
<a id='line_64'>candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches:</a>
<a id='line_65'>and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith</a>
<a id='line_68'>he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the</a>
<a id='line_69'>midst of the seven golden candlesticks; 2:2 I know thy works, and thy</a>
<a id='line_70'>labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are</a>
<a id='line_71'>evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are</a>
<a id='line_72'>not, and hast found them liars: 2:3 And hast borne, and hast patience,</a>
<a id='line_73'>and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left</a>
<a id='line_76'>thy first love.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>2:5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do</a>
<a id='line_79'>the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will</a>
<a id='line_80'>remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the</a>
<a id='line_83'>Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_86'>churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of</a>
<a id='line_87'>life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things</a>
<a id='line_90'>saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; 2:9 I know</a>
<a id='line_91'>thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I</a>
<a id='line_92'>know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but</a>
<a id='line_93'>are the synagogue of Satan.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the</a>
<a id='line_96'>devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye</a>
<a id='line_97'>shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I</a>
<a id='line_98'>will give thee a crown of life.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_101'>churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things</a>
<a id='line_104'>saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; 2:13 I know thy</a>
<a id='line_105'>works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s seat is: and thou</a>
<a id='line_106'>holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days</a>
<a id='line_107'>wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where</a>
<a id='line_108'>Satan dwelleth.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there</a>
<a id='line_111'>them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a</a>
<a id='line_112'>stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed</a>
<a id='line_113'>unto idols, and to commit fornication.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>2:15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the</a>
<a id='line_116'>Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight</a>
<a id='line_119'>against them with the sword of my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_122'>churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden</a>
<a id='line_123'>manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name</a>
<a id='line_124'>written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>2:18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things</a>
<a id='line_127'>saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and</a>
<a id='line_128'>his feet are like fine brass; 2:19 I know thy works, and charity, and</a>
<a id='line_129'>service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to</a>
<a id='line_130'>be more than the first.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou</a>
<a id='line_133'>sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to</a>
<a id='line_134'>teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat</a>
<a id='line_135'>things sacrificed unto idols.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>2:21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she</a>
<a id='line_138'>repented not.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery</a>
<a id='line_141'>with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches</a>
<a id='line_144'>shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I</a>
<a id='line_145'>will give unto every one of you according to your works.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as</a>
<a id='line_148'>have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan,</a>
<a id='line_149'>as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>2:25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him</a>
<a id='line_154'>will I give power over the nations: 2:27 And he shall rule them with a</a>
<a id='line_155'>rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to</a>
<a id='line_156'>shivers: even as I received of my Father.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>2:28 And I will give him the morning star.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>2:29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_161'>churches.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:1 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things</a>
<a id='line_164'>saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I</a>
<a id='line_165'>know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>3:2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are</a>
<a id='line_168'>ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold</a>
<a id='line_171'>fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on</a>
<a id='line_172'>thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon</a>
<a id='line_173'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their</a>
<a id='line_176'>garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>3:5 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment;</a>
<a id='line_179'>and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will</a>
<a id='line_180'>confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>3:6 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_183'>churches.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things</a>
<a id='line_186'>saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David,</a>
<a id='line_187'>he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man</a>
<a id='line_188'>openeth; 3:8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open</a>
<a id='line_189'>door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and</a>
<a id='line_190'>hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they</a>
<a id='line_193'>are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come</a>
<a id='line_194'>and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep</a>
<a id='line_197'>thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world,</a>
<a id='line_198'>to try them that dwell upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>3:11 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no</a>
<a id='line_201'>man take thy crown.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>3:12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,</a>
<a id='line_204'>and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my</a>
<a id='line_205'>God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which</a>
<a id='line_206'>cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my</a>
<a id='line_207'>new name.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>3:13 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_210'>churches.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>3:14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These</a>
<a id='line_213'>things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of</a>
<a id='line_214'>the creation of God; 3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold</a>
<a id='line_215'>nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I</a>
<a id='line_218'>will spue thee out of my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>3:17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and</a>
<a id='line_221'>have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and</a>
<a id='line_222'>miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 3:18 I counsel thee to buy</a>
<a id='line_223'>of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white</a>
<a id='line_224'>raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy</a>
<a id='line_225'>nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that</a>
<a id='line_226'>thou mayest see.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,</a>
<a id='line_229'>and repent.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice,</a>
<a id='line_232'>and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and</a>
<a id='line_233'>he with me.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,</a>
<a id='line_236'>even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>3:22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the</a>
<a id='line_239'>churches.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>4:1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and</a>
<a id='line_242'>the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with</a>
<a id='line_243'>me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must</a>
<a id='line_244'>be hereafter.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>4:2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set</a>
<a id='line_247'>in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>4:3 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine</a>
<a id='line_250'>stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like</a>
<a id='line_251'>unto an emerald.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>4:4 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon</a>
<a id='line_254'>the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white</a>
<a id='line_255'>raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>4:5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and</a>
<a id='line_258'>voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne,</a>
<a id='line_259'>which are the seven Spirits of God.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:</a>
<a id='line_262'>and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four</a>
<a id='line_263'>beasts full of eyes before and behind.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>4:7 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a</a>
<a id='line_266'>calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast</a>
<a id='line_267'>was like a flying eagle.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>4:8 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they</a>
<a id='line_270'>were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying,</a>
<a id='line_271'>Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to</a>
<a id='line_272'>come.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>4:9 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that</a>
<a id='line_275'>sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 4:10 The four and</a>
<a id='line_276'>twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship</a>
<a id='line_277'>him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the</a>
<a id='line_278'>throne, saying, 4:11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and</a>
<a id='line_279'>honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy</a>
<a id='line_280'>pleasure they are and were created.</a>
<a id='line_281'></a>
<a id='line_282'>5:1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book</a>
<a id='line_283'>written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>5:2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is</a>
<a id='line_286'>worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?  5:3 And no</a>
<a id='line_287'>man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open</a>
<a id='line_288'>the book, neither to look thereon.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>5:4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to</a>
<a id='line_291'>read the book, neither to look thereon.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>5:5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of</a>
<a id='line_294'>the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book,</a>
<a id='line_295'>and to loose the seven seals thereof.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>5:6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four</a>
<a id='line_298'>beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been</a>
<a id='line_299'>slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits</a>
<a id='line_300'>of God sent forth into all the earth.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>5:7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that</a>
<a id='line_303'>sat upon the throne.</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>5:8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and</a>
<a id='line_306'>twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them</a>
<a id='line_307'>harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of</a>
<a id='line_308'>saints.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the</a>
<a id='line_311'>book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast</a>
<a id='line_312'>redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and</a>
<a id='line_313'>people, and nation; 5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and</a>
<a id='line_314'>priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>5:11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about</a>
<a id='line_317'>the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was</a>
<a id='line_318'>ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 5:12</a>
<a id='line_319'>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive</a>
<a id='line_320'>power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory,</a>
<a id='line_321'>and blessing.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>5:13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_324'>under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,</a>
<a id='line_325'>heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto</a>
<a id='line_326'>him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>5:14 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders</a>
<a id='line_329'>fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>6:1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as</a>
<a id='line_332'>it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and</a>
<a id='line_333'>see.</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>6:2 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a</a>
<a id='line_336'>bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and</a>
<a id='line_337'>to conquer.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>6:3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast</a>
<a id='line_340'>say, Come and see.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>6:4 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given</a>
<a id='line_343'>to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they</a>
<a id='line_344'>should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</a>
<a id='line_345'></a>
<a id='line_346'>6:5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast</a>
<a id='line_347'>say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat</a>
<a id='line_348'>on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_349'></a>
<a id='line_350'>6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure</a>
<a id='line_351'>of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and</a>
<a id='line_352'>see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>6:7 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_355'>fourth beast say, Come and see.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>6:8 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on</a>
<a id='line_358'>him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto</a>
<a id='line_359'>them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with</a>
<a id='line_360'>hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the</a>
<a id='line_363'>souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the</a>
<a id='line_364'>testimony which they held: 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice,</a>
<a id='line_365'>saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and</a>
<a id='line_366'>avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?  6:11 And white</a>
<a id='line_367'>robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_368'>that they should rest yet for a little season, until their</a>
<a id='line_369'>fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they</a>
<a id='line_370'>were, should be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>6:12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there</a>
<a id='line_373'>was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,</a>
<a id='line_374'>and the moon became as blood; 6:13 And the stars of heaven fell unto</a>
<a id='line_375'>the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is</a>
<a id='line_376'>shaken of a mighty wind.</a>
<a id='line_377'></a>
<a id='line_378'>6:14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;</a>
<a id='line_379'>and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>6:15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,</a>
<a id='line_382'>and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and</a>
<a id='line_383'>every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the</a>
<a id='line_384'>mountains; 6:16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and</a>
<a id='line_385'>hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the</a>
<a id='line_386'>wrath of the Lamb: 6:17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and</a>
<a id='line_387'>who shall be able to stand?  7:1 And after these things I saw four</a>
<a id='line_388'>angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four</a>
<a id='line_389'>winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on</a>
<a id='line_390'>the sea, nor on any tree.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>7:2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal</a>
<a id='line_393'>of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels,</a>
<a id='line_394'>to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 7:3 Saying, Hurt</a>
<a id='line_395'>not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the</a>
<a id='line_396'>servants of our God in their foreheads.</a>
<a id='line_397'></a>
<a id='line_398'>7:4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were</a>
<a id='line_399'>sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the</a>
<a id='line_400'>children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_401'></a>
<a id='line_402'>7:5 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of</a>
<a id='line_403'>Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed</a>
<a id='line_404'>twelve thousand.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>7:6 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of</a>
<a id='line_407'>Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were</a>
<a id='line_408'>sealed twelve thousand.</a>
<a id='line_409'></a>
<a id='line_410'>7:7 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe</a>
<a id='line_411'>of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were</a>
<a id='line_412'>sealed twelve thousand.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>7:8 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe</a>
<a id='line_415'>of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were</a>
<a id='line_416'>sealed twelve thousand.</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>7:9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man</a>
<a id='line_419'>could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,</a>
<a id='line_420'>stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white</a>
<a id='line_421'>robes, and palms in their hands; 7:10 And cried with a loud voice,</a>
<a id='line_422'>saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto</a>
<a id='line_423'>the Lamb.</a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
<a id='line_425'>7:11 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the</a>
<a id='line_426'>elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces,</a>
<a id='line_427'>and worshipped God, 7:12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and</a>
<a id='line_428'>wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto</a>
<a id='line_429'>our God for ever and ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>7:13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these</a>
<a id='line_432'>which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?  7:14 And I</a>
<a id='line_433'>said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they</a>
<a id='line_434'>which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and</a>
<a id='line_435'>made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>7:15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day</a>
<a id='line_438'>and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell</a>
<a id='line_439'>among them.</a>
<a id='line_440'></a>
<a id='line_441'>7:16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall</a>
<a id='line_442'>the sun light on them, nor any heat.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>7:17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,</a>
<a id='line_445'>and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall</a>
<a id='line_446'>wipe away all tears from their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>8:1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in</a>
<a id='line_449'>heaven about the space of half an hour.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>8:2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them</a>
<a id='line_452'>were given seven trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_453'></a>
<a id='line_454'>8:3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden</a>
<a id='line_455'>censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should</a>
<a id='line_456'>offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which</a>
<a id='line_457'>was before the throne.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>8:4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the</a>
<a id='line_460'>saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>8:5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the</a>
<a id='line_463'>altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and</a>
<a id='line_464'>thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>8:6 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared</a>
<a id='line_467'>themselves to sound.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>8:7 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled</a>
<a id='line_470'>with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of</a>
<a id='line_471'>trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>8:8 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain</a>
<a id='line_474'>burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea</a>
<a id='line_475'>became blood; 8:9 And the third part of the creatures which were in</a>
<a id='line_476'>the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were</a>
<a id='line_477'>destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>8:10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from</a>
<a id='line_480'>heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of</a>
<a id='line_481'>the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 8:11 And the name of the</a>
<a id='line_482'>star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became</a>
<a id='line_483'>wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made</a>
<a id='line_484'>bitter.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>8:12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was</a>
<a id='line_487'>smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the</a>
<a id='line_488'>stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone</a>
<a id='line_489'>not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>8:13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of</a>
<a id='line_492'>heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of</a>
<a id='line_493'>the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three</a>
<a id='line_494'>angels, which are yet to sound!  9:1 And the fifth angel sounded, and</a>
<a id='line_495'>I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the</a>
<a id='line_496'>key of the bottomless pit.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>9:2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of</a>
<a id='line_499'>the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were</a>
<a id='line_500'>darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</a>
<a id='line_501'></a>
<a id='line_502'>9:3 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto</a>
<a id='line_503'>them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>9:4 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of</a>
<a id='line_506'>the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those</a>
<a id='line_507'>men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</a>
<a id='line_508'></a>
<a id='line_509'>9:5 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that</a>
<a id='line_510'>they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the</a>
<a id='line_511'>torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>9:6 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and</a>
<a id='line_514'>shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>9:7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto</a>
<a id='line_517'>battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their</a>
<a id='line_518'>faces were as the faces of men.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>9:8 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as</a>
<a id='line_521'>the teeth of lions.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>9:9 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and</a>
<a id='line_524'>the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses</a>
<a id='line_525'>running to battle.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>9:10 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in</a>
<a id='line_528'>their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>9:11 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the</a>
<a id='line_531'>bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the</a>
<a id='line_532'>Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>9:12 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>9:13 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four</a>
<a id='line_537'>horns of the golden altar which is before God, 9:14 Saying to the</a>
<a id='line_538'>sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are</a>
<a id='line_539'>bound in the great river Euphrates.</a>
<a id='line_540'></a>
<a id='line_541'>9:15 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour,</a>
<a id='line_542'>and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>9:16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred</a>
<a id='line_545'>thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>9:17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on</a>
<a id='line_548'>them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and</a>
<a id='line_549'>the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their</a>
<a id='line_550'>mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>9:18 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and</a>
<a id='line_553'>by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>9:19 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their</a>
<a id='line_556'>tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do</a>
<a id='line_557'>hurt.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>9:20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues</a>
<a id='line_560'>yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not</a>
<a id='line_561'>worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone,</a>
<a id='line_562'>and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: 9:21 Neither</a>
<a id='line_563'>repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their</a>
<a id='line_564'>fornication, nor of their thefts.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>10:1 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed</a>
<a id='line_567'>with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it</a>
<a id='line_568'>were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: 10:2 And he had in his</a>
<a id='line_569'>hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_570'>his left foot on the earth, 10:3 And cried with a loud voice, as when</a>
<a id='line_571'>a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their</a>
<a id='line_572'>voices.</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>10:4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about</a>
<a id='line_575'>to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up</a>
<a id='line_576'>those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>10:5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth</a>
<a id='line_579'>lifted up his hand to heaven, 10:6 And sware by him that liveth for</a>
<a id='line_580'>ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are,</a>
<a id='line_581'>and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the</a>
<a id='line_582'>things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: 10:7</a>
<a id='line_583'>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin</a>
<a id='line_584'>to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared</a>
<a id='line_585'>to his servants the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and</a>
<a id='line_588'>said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_589'>angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_590'></a>
<a id='line_591'>10:9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little</a>
<a id='line_592'>book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make</a>
<a id='line_593'>thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it</a>
<a id='line_596'>up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten</a>
<a id='line_597'>it, my belly was bitter.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>10:11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many</a>
<a id='line_600'>peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>11:1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel</a>
<a id='line_603'>stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and</a>
<a id='line_604'>them that worship therein.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure</a>
<a id='line_607'>it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall</a>
<a id='line_608'>they tread under foot forty and two months.</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_611'>prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in</a>
<a id='line_612'>sackcloth.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>11:4 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing</a>
<a id='line_615'>before the God of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>11:5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their</a>
<a id='line_618'>mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he</a>
<a id='line_619'>must in this manner be killed.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>11:6 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of</a>
<a id='line_622'>their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and</a>
<a id='line_623'>to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</a>
<a id='line_624'></a>
<a id='line_625'>11:7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that</a>
<a id='line_626'>ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and</a>
<a id='line_627'>shall overcome them, and kill them.</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>11:8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,</a>
<a id='line_630'>which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was</a>
<a id='line_631'>crucified.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>11:9 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall</a>
<a id='line_634'>see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer</a>
<a id='line_635'>their dead bodies to be put in graves.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>11:10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and</a>
<a id='line_638'>make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two</a>
<a id='line_639'>prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>11:11 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God</a>
<a id='line_642'>entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell</a>
<a id='line_643'>upon them which saw them.</a>
<a id='line_644'></a>
<a id='line_645'>11:12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come</a>
<a id='line_646'>up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their</a>
<a id='line_647'>enemies beheld them.</a>
<a id='line_648'></a>
<a id='line_649'>11:13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth</a>
<a id='line_650'>part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven</a>
<a id='line_651'>thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God</a>
<a id='line_652'>of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>11:14 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh</a>
<a id='line_655'>quickly.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in</a>
<a id='line_658'>heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of</a>
<a id='line_659'>our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>
<a id='line_661'>11:16 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their</a>
<a id='line_662'>seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, 11:17 Saying, We</a>
<a id='line_663'>give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to</a>
<a id='line_664'>come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast</a>
<a id='line_665'>reigned.</a>
<a id='line_666'></a>
<a id='line_667'>11:18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time</a>
<a id='line_668'>of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give</a>
<a id='line_669'>reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them</a>
<a id='line_670'>that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which</a>
<a id='line_671'>destroy the earth.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>11:19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen</a>
<a id='line_674'>in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and</a>
<a id='line_675'>voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</a>
<a id='line_676'></a>
<a id='line_677'>12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with</a>
<a id='line_678'>the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of</a>
<a id='line_679'>twelve stars: 12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in</a>
<a id='line_680'>birth, and pained to be delivered.</a>
<a id='line_681'></a>
<a id='line_682'>12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great</a>
<a id='line_683'>red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon</a>
<a id='line_684'>his heads.</a>
<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did</a>
<a id='line_687'>cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which</a>
<a id='line_688'>was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was</a>
<a id='line_689'>born.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>12:5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations</a>
<a id='line_692'>with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his</a>
<a id='line_693'>throne.</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place</a>
<a id='line_696'>prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two</a>
<a id='line_697'>hundred and threescore days.</a>
<a id='line_698'></a>
<a id='line_699'>12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought</a>
<a id='line_700'>against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 12:8 And</a>
<a id='line_701'>prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_702'></a>
<a id='line_703'>12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the</a>
<a id='line_704'>Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out</a>
<a id='line_705'>into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</a>
<a id='line_706'></a>
<a id='line_707'>12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come</a>
<a id='line_708'>salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of</a>
<a id='line_709'>his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which</a>
<a id='line_710'>accused them before our God day and night.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word</a>
<a id='line_713'>of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</a>
<a id='line_714'></a>
<a id='line_715'>12:12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to</a>
<a id='line_716'>the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down</a>
<a id='line_717'>unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a</a>
<a id='line_718'>short time.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he</a>
<a id='line_721'>persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she</a>
<a id='line_724'>might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished</a>
<a id='line_725'>for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</a>
<a id='line_726'></a>
<a id='line_727'>12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the</a>
<a id='line_728'>woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,</a>
<a id='line_731'>and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war</a>
<a id='line_734'>with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and</a>
<a id='line_735'>have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out</a>
<a id='line_738'>of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten</a>
<a id='line_739'>crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet</a>
<a id='line_742'>were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and</a>
<a id='line_743'>the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his</a>
<a id='line_746'>deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>13:4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast:</a>
<a id='line_749'>and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who</a>
<a id='line_750'>is able to make war with him?  13:5 And there was given unto him a</a>
<a id='line_751'>mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto</a>
<a id='line_752'>him to continue forty and two months.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme</a>
<a id='line_755'>his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to</a>
<a id='line_758'>overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues,</a>
<a id='line_759'>and nations.</a>
<a id='line_760'></a>
<a id='line_761'>13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names</a>
<a id='line_762'>are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the</a>
<a id='line_763'>foundation of the world.</a>
<a id='line_764'></a>
<a id='line_765'>13:9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that</a>
<a id='line_768'>killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the</a>
<a id='line_769'>patience and the faith of the saints.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he</a>
<a id='line_772'>had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,</a>
<a id='line_775'>and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the</a>
<a id='line_776'>first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down</a>
<a id='line_779'>from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 13:14 And deceiveth them</a>
<a id='line_780'>that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had</a>
<a id='line_781'>power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on</a>
<a id='line_782'>the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the</a>
<a id='line_783'>wound by a sword, and did live.</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that</a>
<a id='line_786'>the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as</a>
<a id='line_787'>would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free</a>
<a id='line_790'>and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their</a>
<a id='line_791'>foreheads: 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had</a>
<a id='line_792'>the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number</a>
<a id='line_795'>of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six</a>
<a id='line_796'>hundred threescore and six.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>14:1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with</a>
<a id='line_799'>him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name</a>
<a id='line_800'>written in their foreheads.</a>
<a id='line_801'></a>
<a id='line_802'>14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and</a>
<a id='line_803'>as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers</a>
<a id='line_804'>harping with their harps: 14:3 And they sung as it were a new song</a>
<a id='line_805'>before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no</a>
<a id='line_806'>man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand,</a>
<a id='line_807'>which were redeemed from the earth.</a>
<a id='line_808'></a>
<a id='line_809'>14:4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are</a>
<a id='line_810'>virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</a>
<a id='line_811'>These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and</a>
<a id='line_812'>to the Lamb.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>14:5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault</a>
<a id='line_815'>before the throne of God.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the</a>
<a id='line_818'>everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to</a>
<a id='line_819'>every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 14:7 Saying with a</a>
<a id='line_820'>loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his</a>
<a id='line_821'>judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the</a>
<a id='line_822'>sea, and the fountains of waters.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is</a>
<a id='line_825'>fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the</a>
<a id='line_826'>wine of the wrath of her fornication.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If</a>
<a id='line_829'>any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his</a>
<a id='line_830'>forehead, or in his hand, 14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of</a>
<a id='line_831'>the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of</a>
<a id='line_832'>his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in</a>
<a id='line_833'>the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</a>
<a id='line_834'>14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:</a>
<a id='line_835'>and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his</a>
<a id='line_836'>image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the</a>
<a id='line_839'>commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_840'></a>
<a id='line_841'>14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed</a>
<a id='line_842'>are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the</a>
<a id='line_843'>Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do</a>
<a id='line_844'>follow them.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>14:14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one</a>
<a id='line_847'>sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and</a>
<a id='line_848'>in his hand a sharp sickle.</a>
<a id='line_849'></a>
<a id='line_850'>14:15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud</a>
<a id='line_851'>voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap:</a>
<a id='line_852'>for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is</a>
<a id='line_853'>ripe.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>14:16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;</a>
<a id='line_856'>and the earth was reaped.</a>
<a id='line_857'></a>
<a id='line_858'>14:17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he</a>
<a id='line_859'>also having a sharp sickle.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>14:18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over</a>
<a id='line_862'>fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,</a>
<a id='line_863'>saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the</a>
<a id='line_864'>vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'>14:19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered</a>
<a id='line_867'>the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the</a>
<a id='line_868'>wrath of God.</a>
<a id='line_869'></a>
<a id='line_870'>14:20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came</a>
<a id='line_871'>out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a</a>
<a id='line_872'>thousand and six hundred furlongs.</a>
<a id='line_873'></a>
<a id='line_874'>15:1 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven</a>
<a id='line_875'>angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the</a>
<a id='line_876'>wrath of God.</a>
<a id='line_877'></a>
<a id='line_878'>15:2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them</a>
<a id='line_879'>that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and</a>
<a id='line_880'>over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of</a>
<a id='line_881'>glass, having the harps of God.</a>
<a id='line_882'></a>
<a id='line_883'>15:3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song</a>
<a id='line_884'>of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God</a>
<a id='line_885'>Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>15:4 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou</a>
<a id='line_888'>only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for</a>
<a id='line_889'>thy judgments are made manifest.</a>
<a id='line_890'></a>
<a id='line_891'>15:5 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the</a>
<a id='line_892'>tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 15:6 And the seven</a>
<a id='line_893'>angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in</a>
<a id='line_894'>pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden</a>
<a id='line_895'>girdles.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>15:7 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven</a>
<a id='line_898'>golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and</a>
<a id='line_901'>from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the</a>
<a id='line_902'>seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>16:1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven</a>
<a id='line_905'>angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon</a>
<a id='line_906'>the earth.</a>
<a id='line_907'></a>
<a id='line_908'>16:2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_909'>there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark</a>
<a id='line_910'>of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it</a>
<a id='line_913'>became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the</a>
<a id='line_914'>sea.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>16:4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and</a>
<a id='line_917'>fountains of waters; and they became blood.</a>
<a id='line_918'></a>
<a id='line_919'>16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O</a>
<a id='line_920'>Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged</a>
<a id='line_921'>thus.</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou</a>
<a id='line_924'>hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</a>
<a id='line_925'></a>
<a id='line_926'>16:7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God</a>
<a id='line_927'>Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>16:8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power</a>
<a id='line_930'>was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</a>
<a id='line_931'></a>
<a id='line_932'>16:9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of</a>
<a id='line_933'>God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to</a>
<a id='line_934'>give him glory.</a>
<a id='line_935'></a>
<a id='line_936'>16:10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the</a>
<a id='line_937'>beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their</a>
<a id='line_938'>tongues for pain, 16:11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of</a>
<a id='line_939'>their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river</a>
<a id='line_942'>Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the</a>
<a id='line_943'>kings of the east might be prepared.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>16:13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth</a>
<a id='line_946'>of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth</a>
<a id='line_947'>of the false prophet.</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go</a>
<a id='line_950'>forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather</a>
<a id='line_951'>them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</a>
<a id='line_952'></a>
<a id='line_953'>16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and</a>
<a id='line_954'>keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</a>
<a id='line_955'></a>
<a id='line_956'>16:16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew</a>
<a id='line_957'>tongue Armageddon.</a>
<a id='line_958'></a>
<a id='line_959'>16:17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and</a>
<a id='line_960'>there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,</a>
<a id='line_961'>saying, It is done.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>16:18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there</a>
<a id='line_964'>was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth,</a>
<a id='line_965'>so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>16:19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities</a>
<a id='line_968'>of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God,</a>
<a id='line_969'>to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</a>
<a id='line_970'></a>
<a id='line_971'>16:20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</a>
<a id='line_972'></a>
<a id='line_973'>16:21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone</a>
<a id='line_974'>about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the</a>
<a id='line_975'>plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</a>
<a id='line_976'></a>
<a id='line_977'>17:1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,</a>
<a id='line_978'>and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee</a>
<a id='line_979'>the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: 17:2</a>
<a id='line_980'>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the</a>
<a id='line_981'>inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her</a>
<a id='line_982'>fornication.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I</a>
<a id='line_985'>saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of</a>
<a id='line_986'>blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</a>
<a id='line_987'></a>
<a id='line_988'>17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and</a>
<a id='line_989'>decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup</a>
<a id='line_990'>in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</a>
<a id='line_991'>17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE</a>
<a id='line_992'>GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</a>
<a id='line_993'></a>
<a id='line_994'>17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and</a>
<a id='line_995'>with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered</a>
<a id='line_996'>with great admiration.</a>
<a id='line_997'></a>
<a id='line_998'>17:7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will</a>
<a id='line_999'>tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth</a>
<a id='line_1000'>her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</a>
<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out</a>
<a id='line_1003'>of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on</a>
<a id='line_1004'>the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of</a>
<a id='line_1005'>life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that</a>
<a id='line_1006'>was, and is not, and yet is.</a>
<a id='line_1007'></a>
<a id='line_1008'>17:9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven</a>
<a id='line_1009'>mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</a>
<a id='line_1010'></a>
<a id='line_1011'>17:10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the</a>
<a id='line_1012'>other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short</a>
<a id='line_1013'>space.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>17:11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and</a>
<a id='line_1016'>is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have</a>
<a id='line_1019'>received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with</a>
<a id='line_1020'>the beast.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>17:13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength</a>
<a id='line_1023'>unto the beast.</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>17:14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome</a>
<a id='line_1026'>them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are</a>
<a id='line_1027'>with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</a>
<a id='line_1028'></a>
<a id='line_1029'>17:15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the</a>
<a id='line_1030'>whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</a>
<a id='line_1031'></a>
<a id='line_1032'>17:16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall</a>
<a id='line_1033'>hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat</a>
<a id='line_1034'>her flesh, and burn her with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>17:17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to</a>
<a id='line_1037'>agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God</a>
<a id='line_1038'>shall be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which</a>
<a id='line_1041'>reigneth over the kings of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>18:1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,</a>
<a id='line_1048'>and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and</a>
<a id='line_1049'>hateful bird.</a>
<a id='line_1050'></a>
<a id='line_1051'>18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her</a>
<a id='line_1052'>fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication</a>
<a id='line_1053'>with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>abundance of her delicacies.</a>
<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,</a>
<a id='line_1057'>my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive</a>
<a id='line_1058'>not of her plagues.</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered</a>
<a id='line_1061'>her iniquities.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double</a>
<a id='line_1064'>according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her</a>
<a id='line_1065'>double.</a>
<a id='line_1066'></a>
<a id='line_1067'>18:7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so</a>
<a id='line_1068'>much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a</a>
<a id='line_1069'>queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_1070'></a>
<a id='line_1071'>18:8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is</a>
<a id='line_1073'>the Lord God who judgeth her.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>18:9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and</a>
<a id='line_1076'>lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when</a>
<a id='line_1077'>they shall see the smoke of her burning, 18:10 Standing afar off for</a>
<a id='line_1078'>the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon,</a>
<a id='line_1079'>that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</a>
<a id='line_1080'></a>
<a id='line_1081'>18:11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;</a>
<a id='line_1082'>for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: 18:12 The merchandise of</a>
<a id='line_1083'>gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner</a>
<a id='line_1085'>vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of</a>
<a id='line_1086'>brass, and iron, and marble, 18:13 And cinnamon, and odours, and</a>
<a id='line_1087'>ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and</a>
<a id='line_1088'>wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>and souls of men.</a>
<a id='line_1090'></a>
<a id='line_1091'>18:14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from</a>
<a id='line_1092'>thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from</a>
<a id='line_1093'>thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</a>
<a id='line_1094'></a>
<a id='line_1095'>18:15 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>18:16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine</a>
<a id='line_1098'>linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious</a>
<a id='line_1099'>stones, and pearls!  18:17 For in one hour so great riches is come to</a>
<a id='line_1100'>nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and</a>
<a id='line_1101'>sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, 18:18 And cried</a>
<a id='line_1102'>when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto</a>
<a id='line_1103'>this great city!  18:19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried,</a>
<a id='line_1104'>weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were</a>
<a id='line_1105'>made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!</a>
<a id='line_1106'>for in one hour is she made desolate.</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>18:20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and</a>
<a id='line_1109'>prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</a>
<a id='line_1110'></a>
<a id='line_1111'>18:21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and</a>
<a id='line_1112'>cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city</a>
<a id='line_1113'>Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</a>
<a id='line_1114'></a>
<a id='line_1115'>18:22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and</a>
<a id='line_1116'>trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman,</a>
<a id='line_1117'>of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the</a>
<a id='line_1118'>sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; 18:23 And</a>
<a id='line_1119'>the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the</a>
<a id='line_1120'>voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all</a>
<a id='line_1121'>in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy</a>
<a id='line_1122'>sorceries were all nations deceived.</a>
<a id='line_1123'></a>
<a id='line_1124'>18:24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and</a>
<a id='line_1125'>of all that were slain upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>19:1 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in</a>
<a id='line_1128'>heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>unto the Lord our God: 19:2 For true and righteous are his judgments:</a>
<a id='line_1130'>for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with</a>
<a id='line_1131'>her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her</a>
<a id='line_1132'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>19:3 And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and</a>
<a id='line_1135'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>19:4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and</a>
<a id='line_1138'>worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>19:5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all</a>
<a id='line_1141'>ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.</a>
<a id='line_1142'></a>
<a id='line_1143'>19:6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the</a>
<a id='line_1144'>voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1145'>Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the</a>
<a id='line_1148'>marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>19:8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,</a>
<a id='line_1151'>clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</a>
<a id='line_1152'></a>
<a id='line_1153'>19:9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called</a>
<a id='line_1154'>unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are</a>
<a id='line_1155'>the true sayings of God.</a>
<a id='line_1156'></a>
<a id='line_1157'>19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See</a>
<a id='line_1158'>thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have</a>
<a id='line_1159'>the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the</a>
<a id='line_1160'>spirit of prophecy.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that</a>
<a id='line_1163'>sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he</a>
<a id='line_1164'>doth judge and make war.</a>
<a id='line_1165'></a>
<a id='line_1166'>19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many</a>
<a id='line_1167'>crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name</a>
<a id='line_1170'>is called The Word of God.</a>
<a id='line_1171'></a>
<a id='line_1172'>19:14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white</a>
<a id='line_1173'>horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</a>
<a id='line_1174'></a>
<a id='line_1175'>19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should</a>
<a id='line_1176'>smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he</a>
<a id='line_1177'>treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING</a>
<a id='line_1180'>OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>19:17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud</a>
<a id='line_1183'>voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come</a>
<a id='line_1184'>and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; 19:18</a>
<a id='line_1185'>That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the</a>
<a id='line_1186'>flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on</a>
<a id='line_1187'>them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and</a>
<a id='line_1188'>great.</a>
<a id='line_1189'></a>
<a id='line_1190'>19:19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their</a>
<a id='line_1191'>armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the</a>
<a id='line_1192'>horse, and against his army.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that</a>
<a id='line_1195'>wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had</a>
<a id='line_1196'>received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.</a>
<a id='line_1197'>These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</a>
<a id='line_1198'></a>
<a id='line_1199'>19:21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon</a>
<a id='line_1200'>the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls</a>
<a id='line_1201'>were filled with their flesh.</a>
<a id='line_1202'></a>
<a id='line_1203'>20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the</a>
<a id='line_1204'>bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_1205'></a>
<a id='line_1206'>20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the</a>
<a id='line_1207'>Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 20:3 And cast him</a>
<a id='line_1208'>into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years</a>
<a id='line_1210'>should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given</a>
<a id='line_1213'>unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the</a>
<a id='line_1214'>witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not</a>
<a id='line_1215'>worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark</a>
<a id='line_1216'>upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned</a>
<a id='line_1217'>with Christ a thousand years.</a>
<a id='line_1218'></a>
<a id='line_1219'>20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years</a>
<a id='line_1220'>were finished. This is the first resurrection.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:</a>
<a id='line_1223'>on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of</a>
<a id='line_1224'>God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</a>
<a id='line_1225'></a>
<a id='line_1226'>20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed</a>
<a id='line_1227'>out of his prison, 20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which</a>
<a id='line_1228'>are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them</a>
<a id='line_1229'>together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1230'></a>
<a id='line_1231'>20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the</a>
<a id='line_1232'>camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down</a>
<a id='line_1233'>from God out of heaven, and devoured them.</a>
<a id='line_1234'></a>
<a id='line_1235'>20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire</a>
<a id='line_1236'>and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be</a>
<a id='line_1237'>tormented day and night for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_1238'></a>
<a id='line_1239'>20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from</a>

<a id='line_1242'></a>
<a id='line_1243'>20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the</a>
<a id='line_1244'>books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of</a>
<a id='line_1245'>life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written</a>
<a id='line_1246'>in the books, according to their works.</a>
<a id='line_1247'></a>
<a id='line_1248'>20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and</a>
<a id='line_1249'>hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged</a>
<a id='line_1250'>every man according to their works.</a>
<a id='line_1251'></a>
<a id='line_1252'>20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>second death.</a>
<a id='line_1254'></a>
<a id='line_1255'>20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast</a>
<a id='line_1256'>into the lake of fire.</a>
<a id='line_1257'></a>
<a id='line_1258'>21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and</a>
<a id='line_1259'>the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God</a>
<a id='line_1262'>out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</a>
<a id='line_1263'></a>
<a id='line_1264'>21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the</a>
<a id='line_1265'>tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they</a>
<a id='line_1266'>shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their</a>
<a id='line_1267'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1268'></a>
<a id='line_1269'>21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there</a>
<a id='line_1270'>shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall</a>
<a id='line_1271'>there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</a>
<a id='line_1272'></a>
<a id='line_1273'>21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things</a>
<a id='line_1274'>new.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</a>
<a id='line_1277'></a>
<a id='line_1278'>21:6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the</a>
<a id='line_1279'>beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>fountain of the water of life freely.</a>
<a id='line_1281'></a>
<a id='line_1282'>21:7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his</a>
<a id='line_1283'>God, and he shall be my son.</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and</a>
<a id='line_1286'>murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all</a>
<a id='line_1287'>liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and</a>
<a id='line_1288'>brimstone: which is the second death.</a>
<a id='line_1289'></a>
<a id='line_1290'>21:9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the</a>
<a id='line_1291'>seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,</a>
<a id='line_1292'>saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_1293'></a>
<a id='line_1294'>21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high</a>
<a id='line_1295'>mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_1296'>descending out of heaven from God, 21:11 Having the glory of God: and</a>
<a id='line_1297'>her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper</a>
<a id='line_1298'>stone, clear as crystal; 21:12 And had a wall great and high, and had</a>
<a id='line_1299'>twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written</a>
<a id='line_1300'>thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of</a>
<a id='line_1301'>Israel: 21:13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on</a>
<a id='line_1302'>the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the</a>
<a id='line_1305'>names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</a>
<a id='line_1306'></a>
<a id='line_1307'>21:15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the</a>
<a id='line_1308'>city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1309'></a>
<a id='line_1310'>21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand</a>
<a id='line_1312'>furlongs.</a>
<a id='line_1313'></a>
<a id='line_1314'>The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</a>
<a id='line_1315'></a>
<a id='line_1316'>21:17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four</a>
<a id='line_1317'>cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</a>
<a id='line_1318'></a>
<a id='line_1319'>21:18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city</a>
<a id='line_1320'>was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</a>
<a id='line_1321'></a>
<a id='line_1322'>21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with</a>
<a id='line_1323'>all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the</a>
<a id='line_1324'>second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</a>
<a id='line_1325'>21:20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,</a>
<a id='line_1326'>chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a</a>
<a id='line_1327'>chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was</a>
<a id='line_1330'>of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were</a>
<a id='line_1331'>transparent glass.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>21:22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the</a>
<a id='line_1334'>Lamb are the temple of it.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>21:23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to</a>
<a id='line_1337'>shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the</a>
<a id='line_1338'>light thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1339'></a>
<a id='line_1340'>21:24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light</a>
<a id='line_1341'>of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into</a>
<a id='line_1342'>it.</a>
<a id='line_1343'></a>
<a id='line_1344'>21:25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there</a>
<a id='line_1345'>shall be no night there.</a>
<a id='line_1346'></a>
<a id='line_1347'>21:26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into</a>
<a id='line_1348'>it.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>21:27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that</a>
<a id='line_1351'>defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but</a>
<a id='line_1352'>they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>22:1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,</a>
<a id='line_1355'>proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</a>
<a id='line_1356'></a>
<a id='line_1357'>22:2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the</a>
<a id='line_1358'>river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits,</a>
<a id='line_1359'>and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for</a>
<a id='line_1360'>the healing of the nations.</a>
<a id='line_1361'></a>
<a id='line_1362'>22:3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of</a>
<a id='line_1363'>the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: 22:4 And</a>
<a id='line_1364'>they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.</a>
<a id='line_1365'></a>
<a id='line_1366'>22:5 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,</a>
<a id='line_1367'>neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they</a>
<a id='line_1368'>shall reign for ever and ever.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>22:6 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the</a>
<a id='line_1371'>Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants</a>
<a id='line_1372'>the things which must shortly be done.</a>
<a id='line_1373'></a>
<a id='line_1374'>22:7 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>the prophecy of this book.</a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'>22:8 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard</a>
<a id='line_1378'>and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which</a>
<a id='line_1379'>shewed me these things.</a>
<a id='line_1380'></a>
<a id='line_1381'>22:9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy</a>
<a id='line_1382'>fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which</a>
<a id='line_1383'>keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</a>
<a id='line_1384'></a>
<a id='line_1385'>22:10 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of</a>
<a id='line_1386'>this book: for the time is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_1387'></a>
<a id='line_1388'>22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is</a>
<a id='line_1389'>filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be</a>
<a id='line_1390'>righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</a>
<a id='line_1391'></a>
<a id='line_1392'>22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give</a>
<a id='line_1393'>every man according as his work shall be.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>22:13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and</a>
<a id='line_1396'>the last.</a>
<a id='line_1397'></a>
<a id='line_1398'>22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have</a>
<a id='line_1399'>right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the</a>
<a id='line_1400'>city.</a>
<a id='line_1401'></a>
<a id='line_1402'>22:15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and</a>
<a id='line_1403'>murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in</a>
<a id='line_1406'>the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright</a>
<a id='line_1407'>and morning star.</a>
<a id='line_1408'></a>
<a id='line_1409'>22:17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth</a>
<a id='line_1410'>say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let</a>
<a id='line_1411'>him take the water of life freely.</a>
<a id='line_1412'></a>
<a id='line_1413'>22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the</a>
<a id='line_1414'>prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God</a>
<a id='line_1415'>shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 22:19</a>
<a id='line_1416'>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this</a>
<a id='line_1417'>prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and</a>
<a id='line_1418'>out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</a>
<a id='line_1419'></a>
<a id='line_1420'>22:20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.</a>
<a id='line_1421'>Amen.</a>
<a id='line_1422'></a>
<a id='line_1423'>Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</a>
