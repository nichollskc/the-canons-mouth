                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of Joshua</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to</a>
<a id='line_4'>pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister,</a>
<a id='line_5'>saying, 1:2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over</a>
<a id='line_6'>this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give</a>
<a id='line_7'>to them, even to the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have</a>
<a id='line_10'>I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,</a>
<a id='line_13'>the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great</a>
<a id='line_14'>sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days</a>
<a id='line_17'>of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not</a>
<a id='line_18'>fail thee, nor forsake thee.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_21'>divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers</a>
<a id='line_22'>to give them.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>1:7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe</a>
<a id='line_25'>to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:</a>
<a id='line_26'>turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_27'>prosper withersoever thou goest.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou</a>
<a id='line_30'>shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do</a>
<a id='line_31'>according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy</a>
<a id='line_32'>way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not</a>
<a id='line_35'>afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee</a>
<a id='line_36'>whithersoever thou goest.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 1:11</a>
<a id='line_39'>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you</a>
<a id='line_40'>victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go</a>
<a id='line_41'>in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess</a>
<a id='line_42'>it.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe</a>
<a id='line_45'>of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 1:13 Remember the word which Moses</a>
<a id='line_46'>the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath</a>
<a id='line_47'>given you rest, and hath given you this land.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in</a>
<a id='line_50'>the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass</a>
<a id='line_51'>before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help</a>
<a id='line_52'>them; 1:15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath</a>
<a id='line_53'>given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_54'>God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your</a>
<a id='line_55'>possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’s servant gave you on</a>
<a id='line_56'>this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we</a>
<a id='line_59'>will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we</a>
<a id='line_62'>hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with</a>
<a id='line_63'>Moses.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>1:18 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will</a>
<a id='line_66'>not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall</a>
<a id='line_67'>be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy</a>
<a id='line_70'>secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and</a>
<a id='line_71'>came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came</a>
<a id='line_74'>men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the</a>
<a id='line_75'>country.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the</a>
<a id='line_78'>men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for</a>
<a id='line_79'>they be come to search out all the country.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There</a>
<a id='line_82'>came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 2:5 And it came to</a>
<a id='line_83'>pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that</a>
<a id='line_84'>the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them</a>
<a id='line_85'>quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them</a>
<a id='line_88'>with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:</a>
<a id='line_91'>and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut</a>
<a id='line_92'>the gate.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:8 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the</a>
<a id='line_95'>roof; 2:9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given</a>
<a id='line_96'>you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the</a>
<a id='line_97'>inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea</a>
<a id='line_100'>for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings</a>
<a id='line_101'>of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,</a>
<a id='line_102'>whom ye utterly destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>2:11 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,</a>
<a id='line_105'>neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you:</a>
<a id='line_106'>for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth</a>
<a id='line_107'>beneath.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>2:12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I</a>
<a id='line_110'>have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my</a>
<a id='line_111'>father’s house, and give me a true token: 2:13 And that ye will save</a>
<a id='line_112'>alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and</a>
<a id='line_113'>all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>2:14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not</a>
<a id='line_116'>this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the</a>
<a id='line_117'>land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her</a>
<a id='line_120'>house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the</a>
<a id='line_123'>pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the</a>
<a id='line_124'>pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>2:17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine</a>
<a id='line_127'>oath which thou hast made us swear.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of</a>
<a id='line_130'>scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou</a>
<a id='line_131'>shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy</a>
<a id='line_132'>father’s household, home unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>2:19 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy</a>
<a id='line_135'>house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will</a>
<a id='line_136'>be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood</a>
<a id='line_137'>shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>2:20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of</a>
<a id='line_140'>thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>2:21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent</a>
<a id='line_143'>them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the</a>
<a id='line_144'>window.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>2:22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three</a>
<a id='line_147'>days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them</a>
<a id='line_148'>throughout all the way, but found them not.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>2:23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and</a>
<a id='line_151'>passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all</a>
<a id='line_152'>things that befell them: 2:24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the</a>
<a id='line_153'>LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the</a>
<a id='line_154'>inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>3:1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from</a>
<a id='line_157'>Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_158'>lodged there before they passed over.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>3:2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went</a>
<a id='line_161'>through the host; 3:3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye</a>
<a id='line_162'>see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the</a>
<a id='line_163'>Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after</a>
<a id='line_164'>it.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>3:4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand</a>
<a id='line_167'>cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by</a>
<a id='line_168'>which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to</a>
<a id='line_171'>morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>3:6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_174'>covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of</a>
<a id='line_175'>the covenant, and went before the people.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>3:7 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify</a>
<a id='line_178'>thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was</a>
<a id='line_179'>with Moses, so I will be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_182'>covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of</a>
<a id='line_183'>Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear</a>
<a id='line_186'>the words of the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>3:10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is</a>
<a id='line_189'>among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the</a>
<a id='line_190'>Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and</a>
<a id='line_191'>the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth</a>
<a id='line_194'>passeth over before you into Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>3:12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_197'>out of every tribe a man.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>3:13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of</a>
<a id='line_200'>the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth,</a>
<a id='line_201'>shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be</a>
<a id='line_202'>cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall</a>
<a id='line_203'>stand upon an heap.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>3:14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to</a>
<a id='line_206'>pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant</a>
<a id='line_207'>before the people; 3:15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto</a>
<a id='line_208'>Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in</a>
<a id='line_209'>the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the</a>
<a id='line_210'>time of harvest,) 3:16 That the waters which came down from above</a>
<a id='line_211'>stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is</a>
<a id='line_212'>beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,</a>
<a id='line_213'>even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed</a>
<a id='line_214'>over right against Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>3:17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_217'>stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the</a>
<a id='line_218'>Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed</a>
<a id='line_219'>clean over Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>4:1 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over</a>
<a id='line_222'>Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:2 Take you twelve</a>
<a id='line_223'>men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 4:3 And command ye</a>
<a id='line_224'>them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the</a>
<a id='line_225'>place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_226'>carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where</a>
<a id='line_227'>ye shall lodge this night.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the</a>
<a id='line_230'>children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 4:5 And Joshua said unto</a>
<a id='line_231'>them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_232'>Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_233'>according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 4:6</a>
<a id='line_234'>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their</a>
<a id='line_235'>fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  4:7</a>
<a id='line_236'>Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off</a>
<a id='line_237'>before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over</a>
<a id='line_238'>Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be</a>
<a id='line_239'>for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>4:8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up</a>
<a id='line_242'>twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto</a>
<a id='line_243'>Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of</a>
<a id='line_244'>Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they</a>
<a id='line_245'>lodged, and laid them down there.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the</a>
<a id='line_248'>place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant</a>
<a id='line_249'>stood: and they are there unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>4:10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,</a>
<a id='line_252'>until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak</a>
<a id='line_253'>unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the</a>
<a id='line_254'>people hasted and passed over.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,</a>
<a id='line_257'>that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence</a>
<a id='line_258'>of the people.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>4:12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the</a>
<a id='line_261'>tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as</a>
<a id='line_262'>Moses spake unto them: 4:13 About forty thousand prepared for war</a>
<a id='line_263'>passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>4:14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;</a>
<a id='line_266'>and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>4:15 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16 Command the priests</a>
<a id='line_269'>that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of</a>
<a id='line_272'>Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_275'>covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the</a>
<a id='line_276'>soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the</a>
<a id='line_277'>waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his</a>
<a id='line_278'>banks, as they did before.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>4:19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the</a>
<a id='line_281'>first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did</a>
<a id='line_284'>Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>4:21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your</a>
<a id='line_287'>children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean</a>
<a id='line_288'>these stones?  4:22 Then ye shall let your children know, saying,</a>
<a id='line_289'>Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before</a>
<a id='line_292'>you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red</a>
<a id='line_293'>sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 4:24</a>
<a id='line_294'>That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that</a>
<a id='line_295'>it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which</a>
<a id='line_298'>were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the</a>
<a id='line_299'>Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up</a>
<a id='line_300'>the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were</a>
<a id='line_301'>passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them</a>
<a id='line_302'>any more, because of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,</a>
<a id='line_305'>and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of</a>
<a id='line_308'>Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people</a>
<a id='line_311'>that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died</a>
<a id='line_312'>in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>5:5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the</a>
<a id='line_315'>people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth</a>
<a id='line_316'>out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_319'>till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_320'>were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto</a>
<a id='line_321'>whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the</a>
<a id='line_322'>LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that</a>
<a id='line_323'>floweth with milk and honey.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>5:7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua</a>
<a id='line_326'>circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not</a>
<a id='line_327'>circumcised them by the way.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the</a>
<a id='line_330'>people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were</a>
<a id='line_331'>whole.</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the</a>
<a id='line_334'>reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is</a>
<a id='line_335'>called Gilgal unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the</a>
<a id='line_338'>passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of</a>
<a id='line_339'>Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after</a>
<a id='line_342'>the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the</a>
<a id='line_345'>old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any</a>
<a id='line_346'>more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted</a>
<a id='line_349'>up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against</a>
<a id='line_350'>him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_351'>said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  5:14 And he</a>
<a id='line_352'>said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And</a>
<a id='line_353'>Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_354'>him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?  5:15 And the captain of the</a>
<a id='line_355'>LORD’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for</a>
<a id='line_356'>the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of</a>
<a id='line_359'>Israel: none went out, and none came in.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand</a>
<a id='line_362'>Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>6:3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round</a>
<a id='line_365'>about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>6:4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of</a>
<a id='line_368'>rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven</a>
<a id='line_369'>times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with</a>
<a id='line_372'>the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the</a>
<a id='line_373'>people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall</a>
<a id='line_374'>fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight</a>
<a id='line_375'>before him.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_378'>Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven</a>
<a id='line_379'>trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and</a>
<a id='line_382'>let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that</a>
<a id='line_385'>the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on</a>
<a id='line_386'>before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the</a>
<a id='line_387'>covenant of the LORD followed them.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the</a>
<a id='line_390'>trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on,</a>
<a id='line_391'>and blowing with the trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,</a>
<a id='line_394'>nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out</a>
<a id='line_395'>of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</a>
<a id='line_396'></a>
<a id='line_397'>6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:</a>
<a id='line_398'>and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the</a>
<a id='line_401'>ark of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before</a>
<a id='line_404'>the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets:</a>
<a id='line_405'>and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the</a>
<a id='line_406'>ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned</a>
<a id='line_409'>into the camp: so they did six days.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early</a>
<a id='line_412'>about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same</a>
<a id='line_413'>manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven</a>
<a id='line_414'>times.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew</a>
<a id='line_417'>with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_418'>hath given you the city.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are</a>
<a id='line_421'>therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all</a>
<a id='line_422'>that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we</a>
<a id='line_423'>sent.</a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
<a id='line_425'>6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest</a>
<a id='line_426'>ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and</a>
<a id='line_427'>make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</a>
<a id='line_428'></a>
<a id='line_429'>6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are</a>
<a id='line_430'>consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the</a>
<a id='line_431'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_432'></a>
<a id='line_433'>6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:</a>
<a id='line_434'>and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,</a>
<a id='line_435'>and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down</a>
<a id='line_436'>flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight</a>
<a id='line_437'>before him, and they took the city.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and</a>
<a id='line_440'>woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_441'>sword.</a>
<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the</a>
<a id='line_444'>country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman,</a>
<a id='line_445'>and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</a>
<a id='line_446'></a>
<a id='line_447'>6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,</a>
<a id='line_448'>and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she</a>
<a id='line_449'>had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the</a>
<a id='line_450'>camp of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only</a>
<a id='line_453'>the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they</a>
<a id='line_454'>put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s</a>
<a id='line_457'>household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto</a>
<a id='line_458'>this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out</a>
<a id='line_459'>Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_460'></a>
<a id='line_461'>6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man</a>
<a id='line_462'>before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he</a>
<a id='line_463'>shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest</a>
<a id='line_464'>son shall he set up the gates of it.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout</a>
<a id='line_467'>all the country.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>7:1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed</a>
<a id='line_470'>thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of</a>
<a id='line_471'>Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the</a>
<a id='line_472'>anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,</a>
<a id='line_475'>on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the</a>
<a id='line_476'>country.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>And the men went up and viewed Ai.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the</a>
<a id='line_481'>people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite</a>
<a id='line_482'>Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but</a>
<a id='line_483'>few.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>7:4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:</a>
<a id='line_486'>and they fled before the men of Ai.</a>
<a id='line_487'></a>
<a id='line_488'>7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they</a>
<a id='line_489'>chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in</a>
<a id='line_490'>the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became</a>
<a id='line_491'>as water.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face</a>
<a id='line_494'>before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of</a>
<a id='line_495'>Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</a>
<a id='line_496'></a>
<a id='line_497'>7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all</a>
<a id='line_498'>brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_499'>Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt</a>
<a id='line_500'>on the other side Jordan!  7:8 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel</a>
<a id='line_501'>turneth their backs before their enemies!  7:9 For the Canaanites and</a>
<a id='line_502'>all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us</a>
<a id='line_503'>round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto</a>
<a id='line_504'>thy great name?  7:10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up;</a>
<a id='line_505'>wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?  7:11 Israel hath sinned, and</a>
<a id='line_506'>they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for</a>
<a id='line_507'>they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and</a>
<a id='line_508'>dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</a>
<a id='line_509'></a>
<a id='line_510'>7:12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their</a>
<a id='line_511'>enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they</a>
<a id='line_512'>were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy</a>
<a id='line_513'>the accursed from among you.</a>
<a id='line_514'></a>
<a id='line_515'>7:13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to</a>
<a id='line_516'>morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed</a>
<a id='line_517'>thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before</a>
<a id='line_518'>thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>7:14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your</a>
<a id='line_521'>tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall</a>
<a id='line_522'>come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_523'>shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_524'>shall take shall come man by man.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>7:15 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing</a>
<a id='line_527'>shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath</a>
<a id='line_528'>transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought</a>
<a id='line_529'>folly in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by</a>
<a id='line_532'>their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 7:17 And he brought</a>
<a id='line_533'>the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he</a>
<a id='line_534'>brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</a>
<a id='line_535'>7:18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of</a>
<a id='line_536'>Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was</a>
<a id='line_537'>taken.</a>
<a id='line_538'></a>
<a id='line_539'>7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to</a>
<a id='line_540'>the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now</a>
<a id='line_541'>what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</a>
<a id='line_542'></a>
<a id='line_543'>7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against</a>
<a id='line_544'>the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 7:21 When I saw</a>
<a id='line_545'>among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels</a>
<a id='line_546'>of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted</a>
<a id='line_547'>them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the</a>
<a id='line_548'>midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,</a>
<a id='line_551'>behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</a>
<a id='line_552'></a>
<a id='line_553'>7:23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them</a>
<a id='line_554'>unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out</a>
<a id='line_555'>before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>7:24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,</a>
<a id='line_558'>and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,</a>
<a id='line_559'>and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his</a>
<a id='line_560'>tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of</a>
<a id='line_561'>Achor.</a>
<a id='line_562'></a>
<a id='line_563'>7:25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall</a>
<a id='line_564'>trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and</a>
<a id='line_565'>burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</a>
<a id='line_566'></a>
<a id='line_567'>7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So</a>
<a id='line_568'>the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name</a>
<a id='line_569'>of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_570'></a>
<a id='line_571'>8:1 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:</a>
<a id='line_572'>take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I</a>
<a id='line_573'>have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,</a>
<a id='line_574'>and his land: 8:2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst</a>
<a id='line_575'>unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle</a>
<a id='line_576'>thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush</a>
<a id='line_577'>for the city behind it.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:</a>
<a id='line_580'>and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent</a>
<a id='line_581'>them away by night.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>8:4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait</a>
<a id='line_584'>against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city,</a>
<a id='line_585'>but be ye all ready: 8:5 And I, and all the people that are with me,</a>
<a id='line_586'>will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come</a>
<a id='line_587'>out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 8:6</a>
<a id='line_588'>(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the</a>
<a id='line_589'>city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first:</a>
<a id='line_590'>therefore we will flee before them.</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>8:7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:</a>
<a id='line_593'>for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set</a>
<a id='line_596'>the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye</a>
<a id='line_597'>do. See, I have commanded you.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>8:9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,</a>
<a id='line_600'>and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua</a>
<a id='line_601'>lodged that night among the people.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,</a>
<a id='line_604'>and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>8:11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,</a>
<a id='line_607'>went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the</a>
<a id='line_608'>north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in</a>
<a id='line_611'>ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>8:13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on</a>
<a id='line_614'>the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the</a>
<a id='line_615'>city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</a>
<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted</a>
<a id='line_618'>and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to</a>
<a id='line_619'>battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;</a>
<a id='line_620'>but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the</a>
<a id='line_621'>city.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before</a>
<a id='line_624'>them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>8:16 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue</a>
<a id='line_627'>after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from</a>
<a id='line_628'>the city.</a>
<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>8:17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out</a>
<a id='line_631'>after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>8:18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in</a>
<a id='line_634'>thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua</a>
<a id='line_635'>stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>8:19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as</a>
<a id='line_638'>soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city,</a>
<a id='line_639'>and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_642'>the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to</a>
<a id='line_643'>flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness</a>
<a id='line_644'>turned back upon the pursuers.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the</a>
<a id='line_647'>city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,</a>
<a id='line_648'>and slew the men of Ai.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>8:22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were</a>
<a id='line_651'>in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and</a>
<a id='line_652'>they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all</a>
<a id='line_657'>the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they</a>
<a id='line_658'>chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,</a>
<a id='line_659'>until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,</a>
<a id='line_660'>and smote it with the edge of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>8:25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and</a>
<a id='line_663'>women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>8:26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the</a>
<a id='line_666'>spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</a>
<a id='line_667'></a>
<a id='line_668'>8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey</a>
<a id='line_669'>unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he</a>
<a id='line_670'>commanded Joshua.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>8:28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a</a>
<a id='line_673'>desolation unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_674'></a>
<a id='line_675'>8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as</a>
<a id='line_676'>soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his</a>
<a id='line_677'>carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of</a>
<a id='line_678'>the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth</a>
<a id='line_679'>unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>8:30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount</a>
<a id='line_682'>Ebal, 8:31 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of</a>
<a id='line_683'>Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of</a>
<a id='line_684'>whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they</a>
<a id='line_685'>offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace</a>
<a id='line_686'>offerings.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>8:32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,</a>
<a id='line_689'>which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>8:33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,</a>
<a id='line_692'>stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the</a>
<a id='line_693'>Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the</a>
<a id='line_694'>stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against</a>
<a id='line_695'>mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the</a>
<a id='line_696'>servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the</a>
<a id='line_697'>people of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_698'></a>
<a id='line_699'>8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and</a>
<a id='line_700'>cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</a>
<a id='line_701'></a>
<a id='line_702'>8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua</a>
<a id='line_703'>read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and</a>
<a id='line_704'>the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side</a>
<a id='line_707'>Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the</a>
<a id='line_708'>great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the</a>
<a id='line_709'>Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;</a>
<a id='line_710'>9:2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and</a>
<a id='line_711'>with Israel, with one accord.</a>
<a id='line_712'></a>
<a id='line_713'>9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto</a>
<a id='line_714'>Jericho and to Ai, 9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if</a>
<a id='line_715'>they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and</a>
<a id='line_716'>wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 9:5 And old shoes and</a>
<a id='line_717'>clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread</a>
<a id='line_718'>of their provision was dry and mouldy.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_721'>him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now</a>
<a id='line_722'>therefore make ye a league with us.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell</a>
<a id='line_725'>among us; and how shall we make a league with you?  9:8 And they said</a>
<a id='line_726'>unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are</a>
<a id='line_727'>ye? and from whence come ye?  9:9 And they said unto him, From a very</a>
<a id='line_728'>far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_729'>God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_730'>9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were</a>
<a id='line_731'>beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,</a>
<a id='line_732'>which was at Ashtaroth.</a>
<a id='line_733'></a>
<a id='line_734'>9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake</a>
<a id='line_735'>to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet</a>
<a id='line_736'>them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a</a>
<a id='line_737'>league with us.</a>
<a id='line_738'></a>
<a id='line_739'>9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on</a>
<a id='line_740'>the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and</a>
<a id='line_741'>it is mouldy: 9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were</a>
<a id='line_742'>new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes</a>
<a id='line_743'>are become old by reason of the very long journey.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the</a>
<a id='line_746'>mouth of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to</a>
<a id='line_749'>let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made</a>
<a id='line_752'>a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours,</a>
<a id='line_753'>and that they dwelt among them.</a>
<a id='line_754'></a>
<a id='line_755'>9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities</a>
<a id='line_756'>on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and</a>
<a id='line_757'>Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of</a>
<a id='line_760'>the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And</a>
<a id='line_761'>all the congregation murmured against the princes.</a>
<a id='line_762'></a>
<a id='line_763'>9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn</a>
<a id='line_764'>unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch</a>
<a id='line_765'>them.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath</a>
<a id='line_768'>be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be</a>
<a id='line_771'>hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the</a>
<a id='line_772'>princes had promised them.</a>
<a id='line_773'></a>
<a id='line_774'>9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,</a>
<a id='line_775'>Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when</a>
<a id='line_776'>ye dwell among us?  9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall</a>
<a id='line_777'>none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and</a>
<a id='line_778'>drawers of water for the house of my God.</a>
<a id='line_779'></a>
<a id='line_780'>9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told</a>
<a id='line_781'>thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to</a>
<a id='line_782'>give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land</a>
<a id='line_783'>from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of</a>
<a id='line_784'>you, and have done this thing.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'>9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and</a>
<a id='line_787'>right unto thee to do unto us, do.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of</a>
<a id='line_790'>the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water</a>
<a id='line_793'>for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this</a>
<a id='line_794'>day, in the place which he should choose.</a>
<a id='line_795'></a>
<a id='line_796'>10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard</a>
<a id='line_797'>how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done</a>
<a id='line_798'>to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how</a>
<a id='line_799'>the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among</a>
<a id='line_800'>them; 10:2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,</a>
<a id='line_801'>as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and</a>
<a id='line_802'>all the men thereof were mighty.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of</a>
<a id='line_805'>Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of</a>
<a id='line_806'>Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 10:4 Come up unto me,</a>
<a id='line_807'>and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with</a>
<a id='line_808'>Joshua and with the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_811'>the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king</a>
<a id='line_812'>of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all</a>
<a id='line_813'>their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</a>
<a id='line_814'></a>
<a id='line_815'>10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,</a>
<a id='line_816'>saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,</a>
<a id='line_817'>and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell</a>
<a id='line_818'>in the mountains are gathered together against us.</a>
<a id='line_819'></a>
<a id='line_820'>10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war</a>
<a id='line_821'>with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have</a>
<a id='line_824'>delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand</a>
<a id='line_825'>before thee.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal</a>
<a id='line_828'>all night.</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>10:10 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with</a>
<a id='line_831'>a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth</a>
<a id='line_832'>up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were</a>
<a id='line_835'>in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones</a>
<a id='line_836'>from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which</a>
<a id='line_837'>died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with</a>
<a id='line_838'>the sword.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>10:12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered</a>
<a id='line_841'>up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the</a>
<a id='line_842'>sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in</a>
<a id='line_843'>the valley of Ajalon.</a>
<a id='line_844'></a>
<a id='line_845'>10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people</a>
<a id='line_846'>had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the</a>
<a id='line_847'>book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_848'>hasted not to go down about a whole day.</a>
<a id='line_849'></a>
<a id='line_850'>10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the</a>
<a id='line_851'>LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for</a>
<a id='line_852'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_853'></a>
<a id='line_854'>10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to</a>
<a id='line_855'>Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>10:16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at</a>
<a id='line_858'>Makkedah.</a>
<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in</a>
<a id='line_861'>a cave at Makkedah.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,</a>
<a id='line_864'>and set men by it for to keep them: 10:19 And stay ye not, but pursue</a>
<a id='line_865'>after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to</a>
<a id='line_866'>enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them</a>
<a id='line_867'>into your hand.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had</a>
<a id='line_870'>made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they</a>
<a id='line_871'>were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into</a>
<a id='line_872'>fenced cities.</a>
<a id='line_873'></a>
<a id='line_874'>10:21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in</a>
<a id='line_875'>peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out</a>
<a id='line_878'>those five kings unto me out of the cave.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out</a>
<a id='line_881'>of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of</a>
<a id='line_882'>Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto</a>
<a id='line_885'>Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_886'>the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put</a>
<a id='line_887'>your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put</a>
<a id='line_888'>their feet upon the necks of them.</a>
<a id='line_889'></a>
<a id='line_890'>10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong</a>
<a id='line_891'>and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies</a>
<a id='line_892'>against whom ye fight.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>10:26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them</a>
<a id='line_895'>on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,</a>
<a id='line_898'>that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast</a>
<a id='line_899'>them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in</a>
<a id='line_900'>the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.</a>
<a id='line_901'></a>
<a id='line_902'>10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of</a>
<a id='line_903'>the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all</a>
<a id='line_904'>the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the</a>
<a id='line_905'>king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_906'></a>
<a id='line_907'>10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto</a>
<a id='line_908'>Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 10:30 And the LORD delivered it</a>
<a id='line_909'>also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it</a>
<a id='line_910'>with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he</a>
<a id='line_911'>let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto</a>
<a id='line_912'>the king of Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_913'></a>
<a id='line_914'>10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto</a>
<a id='line_915'>Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:32 And the</a>
<a id='line_916'>LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the</a>
<a id='line_917'>second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls</a>
<a id='line_918'>that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua</a>
<a id='line_921'>smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with</a>
<a id='line_924'>him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:35 And</a>
<a id='line_925'>they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and</a>
<a id='line_926'>all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,</a>
<a id='line_927'>according to all that he had done to Lachish.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto</a>
<a id='line_930'>Hebron; and they fought against it: 10:37 And they took it, and smote</a>
<a id='line_931'>it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the</a>
<a id='line_932'>cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none</a>
<a id='line_933'>remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed</a>
<a id='line_934'>it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.</a>
<a id='line_935'></a>
<a id='line_936'>10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and</a>
<a id='line_937'>fought against it: 10:39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all</a>
<a id='line_938'>the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,</a>
<a id='line_939'>and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none</a>
<a id='line_940'>remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the</a>
<a id='line_941'>king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.</a>
<a id='line_942'></a>
<a id='line_943'>10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,</a>
<a id='line_944'>and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none</a>
<a id='line_945'>remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_946'>Israel commanded.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all</a>
<a id='line_949'>the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</a>
<a id='line_950'></a>
<a id='line_951'>10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,</a>
<a id='line_952'>because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</a>
<a id='line_953'></a>
<a id='line_954'>10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to</a>
<a id='line_955'>Gilgal.</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those</a>
<a id='line_958'>things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of</a>
<a id='line_959'>Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 11:2 And to the kings that were</a>
<a id='line_960'>on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth,</a>
<a id='line_961'>and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 11:3 And to</a>
<a id='line_962'>the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the</a>
<a id='line_963'>Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to</a>
<a id='line_964'>the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</a>
<a id='line_965'></a>
<a id='line_966'>11:4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much</a>
<a id='line_967'>people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with</a>
<a id='line_968'>horses and chariots very many.</a>
<a id='line_969'></a>
<a id='line_970'>11:5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched</a>
<a id='line_971'>together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</a>
<a id='line_972'></a>
<a id='line_973'>11:6 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for</a>
<a id='line_974'>to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before</a>
<a id='line_975'>Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with</a>
<a id='line_976'>fire.</a>
<a id='line_977'></a>
<a id='line_978'>11:7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them</a>
<a id='line_979'>by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.</a>
<a id='line_980'></a>
<a id='line_981'>11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote</a>
<a id='line_982'>them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and</a>
<a id='line_983'>unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they</a>
<a id='line_984'>left them none remaining.</a>
<a id='line_985'></a>
<a id='line_986'>11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their</a>
<a id='line_987'>horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</a>
<a id='line_988'></a>
<a id='line_989'>11:10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote</a>
<a id='line_990'>the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of</a>
<a id='line_991'>all those kingdoms.</a>
<a id='line_992'></a>
<a id='line_993'>11:11 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of</a>
<a id='line_994'>the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe:</a>
<a id='line_995'>and he burnt Hazor with fire.</a>
<a id='line_996'></a>
<a id='line_997'>11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,</a>
<a id='line_998'>did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he</a>
<a id='line_999'>utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.</a>
<a id='line_1000'></a>
<a id='line_1001'>11:13 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel</a>
<a id='line_1002'>burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.</a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>11:14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children</a>
<a id='line_1005'>of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote</a>
<a id='line_1006'>with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither</a>
<a id='line_1007'>left they any to breathe.</a>
<a id='line_1008'></a>
<a id='line_1009'>11:15 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command</a>
<a id='line_1010'>Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1011'>commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1012'></a>
<a id='line_1013'>11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south</a>
<a id='line_1014'>country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 11:17 Even</a>
<a id='line_1016'>from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the</a>
<a id='line_1017'>valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and</a>
<a id='line_1018'>smote them, and slew them.</a>
<a id='line_1019'></a>
<a id='line_1020'>11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of</a>
<a id='line_1023'>Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they</a>
<a id='line_1024'>took in battle.</a>
<a id='line_1025'></a>
<a id='line_1026'>11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should</a>
<a id='line_1027'>come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and</a>
<a id='line_1028'>that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the</a>
<a id='line_1029'>LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>11:21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the</a>
<a id='line_1032'>mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the</a>
<a id='line_1033'>mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua</a>
<a id='line_1034'>destroyed them utterly with their cities.</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children</a>
<a id='line_1037'>of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</a>
<a id='line_1038'></a>
<a id='line_1039'>11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1040'>said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel</a>
<a id='line_1041'>according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from</a>
<a id='line_1042'>war.</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_1045'>smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the</a>
<a id='line_1046'>rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the</a>
<a id='line_1047'>plain on the east: 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_1048'>Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river</a>
<a id='line_1049'>Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even</a>
<a id='line_1050'>unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</a>
<a id='line_1051'>12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto</a>
<a id='line_1052'>the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to</a>
<a id='line_1053'>Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: 12:4 And the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 12:5 And reigned in mount</a>
<a id='line_1056'>Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the</a>
<a id='line_1057'>Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon</a>
<a id='line_1058'>king of Heshbon.</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>12:6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_1061'>smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto</a>
<a id='line_1062'>the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.</a>
<a id='line_1063'></a>
<a id='line_1064'>12:7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the</a>
<a id='line_1065'>children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad</a>
<a id='line_1066'>in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to</a>
<a id='line_1067'>Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession</a>
<a id='line_1068'>according to their divisions; 12:8 In the mountains, and in the</a>
<a id='line_1069'>valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_1070'>and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the</a>
<a id='line_1071'>Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 12:9 The</a>
<a id='line_1072'>king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;</a>
<a id='line_1073'>12:10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 The</a>

<a id='line_1075'>Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 12:13 The king of Debir, one; the</a>
<a id='line_1076'>king of Geder, one; 12:14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>one; 12:15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 12:16</a>
<a id='line_1078'>The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 12:17 The king of</a>
<a id='line_1079'>Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 12:18 The king of Aphek, one;</a>
<a id='line_1080'>the king of Lasharon, one; 12:19 The king of Madon, one; the king of</a>
<a id='line_1081'>Hazor, one; 12:20 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>one; 12:21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 12:22</a>

<a id='line_1086'>one.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto</a>

<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>13:2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the</a>

<a id='line_1103'>13:6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto</a>

<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>13:7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine</a>

<a id='line_1111'>them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD</a>

<a id='line_1118'>All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in</a>

<a id='line_1122'>13:13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,</a>

<a id='line_1125'></a>
<a id='line_1126'>13:14 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the</a>

<a id='line_1128'>inheritance, as he said unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1129'></a>
<a id='line_1130'>13:15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben</a>

<a id='line_1142'>and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon,</a>

<a id='line_1144'></a>
<a id='line_1145'>13:22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of</a>

<a id='line_1151'></a>
<a id='line_1152'>13:24 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the</a>

<a id='line_1216'>14:9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy</a>
<a id='line_1217'>feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s for</a>
<a id='line_1218'>ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.</a>
<a id='line_1219'></a>
<a id='line_1220'>14:10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these</a>
<a id='line_1221'>forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses,</a>
<a id='line_1222'>while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo,</a>
<a id='line_1223'>I am this day fourscore and five years old.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>14:11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses</a>
<a id='line_1226'>sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,</a>
<a id='line_1227'>both to go out, and to come in.</a>
<a id='line_1228'></a>
<a id='line_1229'>14:12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in</a>
<a id='line_1230'>that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there,</a>
<a id='line_1231'>and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be</a>
<a id='line_1232'>with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</a>
<a id='line_1233'></a>
<a id='line_1234'>14:13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh</a>
<a id='line_1235'>Hebron for an inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_1236'></a>
<a id='line_1237'>14:14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of</a>
<a id='line_1238'>Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed</a>
<a id='line_1239'>the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>
<a id='line_1241'>14:15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a</a>
<a id='line_1242'>great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.</a>
<a id='line_1243'></a>
<a id='line_1244'>15:1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by</a>
<a id='line_1245'>their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin</a>
<a id='line_1246'>southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.</a>
<a id='line_1247'></a>
<a id='line_1248'>15:2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from</a>
<a id='line_1249'>the bay that looketh southward: 15:3 And it went out to the south side</a>
<a id='line_1250'>to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the</a>
<a id='line_1251'>south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up</a>
<a id='line_1252'>to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: 15:4 From thence it passed</a>
<a id='line_1253'>toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out</a>
<a id='line_1254'>of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</a>
<a id='line_1255'></a>
<a id='line_1256'>15:5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of</a>
<a id='line_1257'>Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at</a>
<a id='line_1260'>the uttermost part of Jordan: 15:6 And the border went up to</a>
<a id='line_1261'>Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border</a>
<a id='line_1262'>went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 15:7 And the border</a>
<a id='line_1263'>went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which</a>
<a id='line_1265'>is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the</a>
<a id='line_1266'>waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: 15:8</a>
<a id='line_1267'>And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the</a>
<a id='line_1268'>south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went</a>
<a id='line_1269'>up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom</a>
<a id='line_1270'>westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:</a>
<a id='line_1271'>15:9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the</a>
<a id='line_1272'>fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount</a>
<a id='line_1273'>Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:</a>
<a id='line_1274'>15:10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,</a>
<a id='line_1275'>and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on</a>
<a id='line_1276'>the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</a>
<a id='line_1277'>15:11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and</a>
<a id='line_1278'>the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and</a>
<a id='line_1279'>went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the</a>
<a id='line_1280'>sea.</a>
<a id='line_1281'></a>
<a id='line_1282'>15:12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1283'></a>
<a id='line_1284'>This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to</a>
<a id='line_1285'>their families.</a>
<a id='line_1286'></a>
<a id='line_1287'>15:13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the</a>
<a id='line_1288'>children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,</a>
<a id='line_1289'>even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>15:14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and</a>
<a id='line_1292'>Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.</a>
<a id='line_1293'></a>
<a id='line_1294'>15:15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name</a>
<a id='line_1295'>of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.</a>
<a id='line_1296'></a>
<a id='line_1297'>15:16 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to</a>
<a id='line_1298'>him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</a>
<a id='line_1299'></a>
<a id='line_1300'>15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and</a>
<a id='line_1301'>he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'>15:18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to</a>
<a id='line_1304'>ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said</a>
<a id='line_1305'>unto her, What wouldest thou?  15:19 Who answered, Give me a blessing;</a>
<a id='line_1306'>for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water.</a>
<a id='line_1307'>And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.</a>
<a id='line_1308'></a>
<a id='line_1309'>15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah</a>
<a id='line_1310'>according to their families.</a>

<a id='line_1312'>15:21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah</a>

<a id='line_1348'>and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>15:63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children</a>
<a id='line_1351'>of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the</a>
<a id='line_1352'>children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>16:1 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by</a>
<a id='line_1355'>Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that</a>
<a id='line_1356'>goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, 16:2 And goeth out from</a>
<a id='line_1357'>Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,</a>
<a id='line_1358'>16:3 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast</a>
<a id='line_1359'>of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are</a>
<a id='line_1360'>at the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1361'></a>
<a id='line_1362'>16:4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their</a>
<a id='line_1363'>inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_1364'></a>
<a id='line_1365'>16:5 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their</a>
<a id='line_1366'>families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east</a>
<a id='line_1367'>side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 16:6 And the border</a>
<a id='line_1368'>went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the</a>
<a id='line_1369'>border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the</a>
<a id='line_1370'>east to Janohah; 16:7 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to</a>
<a id='line_1371'>Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_1372'></a>
<a id='line_1373'>16:8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;</a>
<a id='line_1374'>and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.</a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'>16:9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among</a>
<a id='line_1378'>the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their</a>
<a id='line_1379'>villages.</a>
<a id='line_1380'></a>
<a id='line_1381'>16:10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but</a>
<a id='line_1382'>the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve</a>
<a id='line_1383'>under tribute.</a>
<a id='line_1384'></a>
<a id='line_1385'>17:1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the</a>
<a id='line_1386'>firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the</a>
<a id='line_1387'>father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead</a>
<a id='line_1388'>and Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_1389'></a>
<a id='line_1390'>17:2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by</a>
<a id='line_1391'>their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of</a>
<a id='line_1392'>Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of</a>
<a id='line_1393'>Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of</a>
<a id='line_1394'>Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by</a>
<a id='line_1395'>their families.</a>
<a id='line_1396'></a>
<a id='line_1397'>17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of</a>
<a id='line_1398'>Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are</a>
<a id='line_1399'>the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and</a>
<a id='line_1400'>Tirzah.</a>
<a id='line_1401'></a>
<a id='line_1402'>17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua</a>
<a id='line_1403'>the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded</a>
<a id='line_1404'>Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore</a>
<a id='line_1405'>according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance</a>
<a id='line_1406'>among the brethren of their father.</a>
<a id='line_1407'></a>
<a id='line_1408'>17:5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of</a>
<a id='line_1409'>Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; 17:6 Because</a>
<a id='line_1410'>the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the</a>
<a id='line_1411'>rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_1412'></a>
<a id='line_1413'>17:7 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that</a>
<a id='line_1414'>lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto</a>
<a id='line_1415'>the inhabitants of Entappuah.</a>
<a id='line_1416'></a>
<a id='line_1417'>17:8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border</a>
<a id='line_1418'>of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 17:9 And the coast</a>
<a id='line_1419'>descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities</a>
<a id='line_1420'>of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh</a>
<a id='line_1421'>also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were</a>
<a id='line_1422'>at the sea: 17:10 Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was</a>
<a id='line_1423'>Manasseh’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher</a>
<a id='line_1424'>on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</a>
<a id='line_1425'></a>
<a id='line_1426'>17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her</a>
<a id='line_1427'>towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her</a>
<a id='line_1428'>towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_1429'>of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her</a>
<a id='line_1430'>towns, even three countries.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>17:12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_1433'>of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</a>
<a id='line_1434'></a>
<a id='line_1435'>17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen</a>
<a id='line_1436'>strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly</a>
<a id='line_1437'>drive them out.</a>
<a id='line_1438'></a>
<a id='line_1439'>17:14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast</a>
<a id='line_1440'>thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a</a>
<a id='line_1441'>great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  17:15</a>
<a id='line_1442'>And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up</a>
<a id='line_1443'>to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the</a>
<a id='line_1444'>Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>17:16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:</a>
<a id='line_1447'>and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have</a>
<a id='line_1448'>chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and</a>
<a id='line_1449'>they who are of the valley of Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_1450'></a>
<a id='line_1451'>17:17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and</a>
<a id='line_1452'>to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power:</a>
<a id='line_1453'>thou shalt not have one lot only: 17:18 But the mountain shall be</a>
<a id='line_1454'>thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings</a>
<a id='line_1455'>of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though</a>
<a id='line_1456'>they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.</a>
<a id='line_1457'></a>
<a id='line_1458'>18:1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled</a>
<a id='line_1459'>together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation</a>
<a id='line_1460'>there. And the land was subdued before them.</a>
<a id='line_1461'></a>
<a id='line_1462'>18:2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,</a>
<a id='line_1463'>which had not yet received their inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_1464'></a>
<a id='line_1465'>18:3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye</a>
<a id='line_1466'>slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers</a>
<a id='line_1467'>hath given you?  18:4 Give out from among you three men for each</a>
<a id='line_1468'>tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the</a>
<a id='line_1469'>land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they</a>
<a id='line_1470'>shall come again to me.</a>
<a id='line_1471'></a>
<a id='line_1472'>18:5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in</a>
<a id='line_1473'>their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their</a>
<a id='line_1474'>coasts on the north.</a>
<a id='line_1475'></a>
<a id='line_1476'>18:6 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring</a>
<a id='line_1477'>the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before</a>
<a id='line_1478'>the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_1479'></a>
<a id='line_1480'>18:7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the</a>
<a id='line_1481'>LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of</a>
<a id='line_1482'>Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,</a>
<a id='line_1483'>which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.</a>
<a id='line_1484'></a>
<a id='line_1485'>18:8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that</a>
<a id='line_1486'>went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and</a>
<a id='line_1487'>describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you</a>

<a id='line_1490'>18:9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by</a>

<a id='line_1493'></a>
<a id='line_1494'>18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and</a>

<a id='line_1497'></a>
<a id='line_1498'>18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up</a>

<a id='line_1823'>21:44 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that</a>

<a id='line_1833'>Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice</a>
<a id='line_1834'>in all that I commanded you: 22:3 Ye have not left your brethren these</a>
<a id='line_1835'>many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment</a>
<a id='line_1836'>of the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_1837'></a>
<a id='line_1838'>22:4 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as</a>
<a id='line_1839'>he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your</a>
<a id='line_1840'>tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant</a>
<a id='line_1841'>of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_1842'></a>
<a id='line_1843'>22:5 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which</a>
<a id='line_1844'>Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God,</a>
<a id='line_1845'>and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to</a>
<a id='line_1846'>cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all</a>
<a id='line_1847'>your soul.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>22:6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto</a>
<a id='line_1850'>their tents.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>22:7 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given</a>
<a id='line_1853'>possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua</a>
<a id='line_1854'>among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua</a>
<a id='line_1855'>sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, 22:8 And</a>
<a id='line_1856'>he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents,</a>
<a id='line_1857'>and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass,</a>
<a id='line_1858'>and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your</a>
<a id='line_1859'>enemies with your brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1860'></a>
<a id='line_1861'>22:9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half</a>
<a id='line_1862'>tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_1863'>out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country</a>
<a id='line_1864'>of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were</a>
<a id='line_1865'>possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1866'></a>
<a id='line_1867'>22:10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the</a>
<a id='line_1868'>land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the</a>
<a id='line_1869'>half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar</a>
<a id='line_1870'>to see to.</a>
<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>22:11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of</a>
<a id='line_1873'>Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have</a>
<a id='line_1874'>built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of</a>
<a id='line_1875'>Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>22:12 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole</a>
<a id='line_1878'>congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at</a>
<a id='line_1879'>Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</a>
<a id='line_1880'></a>
<a id='line_1881'>22:13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and</a>
<a id='line_1882'>to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the</a>
<a id='line_1883'>land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 22:14 And with</a>
<a id='line_1884'>him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the</a>
<a id='line_1885'>tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their</a>
<a id='line_1886'>fathers among the thousands of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>22:15 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children</a>
<a id='line_1889'>of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>and they spake with them, saying, 22:16 Thus saith the whole</a>
<a id='line_1891'>congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed</a>
<a id='line_1892'>against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the</a>
<a id='line_1893'>LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this</a>
<a id='line_1894'>day against the LORD?  22:17 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for</a>
<a id='line_1895'>us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was</a>
<a id='line_1896'>a plague in the congregation of the LORD, 22:18 But that ye must turn</a>
<a id='line_1897'>away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel</a>
<a id='line_1898'>to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the</a>
<a id='line_1899'>whole congregation of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1900'></a>
<a id='line_1901'>22:19 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then</a>
<a id='line_1902'>pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the</a>
<a id='line_1903'>LORD’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel</a>
<a id='line_1904'>not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar</a>
<a id='line_1905'>beside the altar of the LORD our God.</a>
<a id='line_1906'></a>
<a id='line_1907'>22:20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed</a>
<a id='line_1908'>thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man</a>
<a id='line_1909'>perished not alone in his iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_1910'></a>
<a id='line_1911'>22:21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half</a>
<a id='line_1912'>tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands</a>
<a id='line_1913'>of Israel, 22:22 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he</a>
<a id='line_1914'>knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in</a>
<a id='line_1915'>transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 22:23 That we</a>
<a id='line_1916'>have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer</a>
<a id='line_1917'>thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace</a>
<a id='line_1918'>offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; 22:24 And if we</a>
<a id='line_1919'>have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to</a>
<a id='line_1920'>come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye</a>
<a id='line_1921'>to do with the LORD God of Israel?  22:25 For the LORD hath made</a>
<a id='line_1922'>Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children</a>
<a id='line_1923'>of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our</a>
<a id='line_1924'>children cease from fearing the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1925'></a>
<a id='line_1926'>22:26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not</a>
<a id='line_1927'>for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 22:27 But that it may be a</a>
<a id='line_1928'>witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we</a>
<a id='line_1929'>might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings,</a>
<a id='line_1930'>and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your</a>
<a id='line_1931'>children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part</a>
<a id='line_1932'>in the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1933'></a>
<a id='line_1934'>22:28 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to</a>
<a id='line_1935'>us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness</a>
<a id='line_1938'>between us and you.</a>
<a id='line_1939'></a>
<a id='line_1940'>22:29 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this</a>
<a id='line_1941'>day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings,</a>
<a id='line_1942'>for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1943'>our God that is before his tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_1944'></a>
<a id='line_1945'>22:30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_1946'>congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him,</a>
<a id='line_1947'>heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad</a>
<a id='line_1948'>and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.</a>
<a id='line_1949'></a>
<a id='line_1950'>22:31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the</a>
<a id='line_1951'>children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of</a>
<a id='line_1952'>Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye</a>
<a id='line_1953'>have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have</a>
<a id='line_1954'>delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>22:32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,</a>
<a id='line_1957'>returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of</a>
<a id='line_1959'>Israel, and brought them word again.</a>
<a id='line_1960'></a>
<a id='line_1961'>22:33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children</a>
<a id='line_1962'>of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in</a>
<a id='line_1963'>battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad</a>
<a id='line_1964'>dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_1965'></a>
<a id='line_1966'>22:34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the</a>
<a id='line_1967'>altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.</a>
<a id='line_1968'></a>
<a id='line_1969'>23:1 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given</a>
<a id='line_1970'>rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed</a>
<a id='line_1971'>old and stricken in age.</a>
<a id='line_1972'></a>
<a id='line_1973'>23:2 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for</a>
<a id='line_1974'>their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said</a>
<a id='line_1975'>unto them, I am old and stricken in age: 23:3 And ye have seen all</a>
<a id='line_1976'>that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of</a>
<a id='line_1977'>you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.</a>
<a id='line_1978'></a>
<a id='line_1979'>23:4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,</a>
<a id='line_1980'>to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the</a>
<a id='line_1981'>nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>23:5 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and</a>
<a id='line_1984'>drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as</a>
<a id='line_1985'>the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1986'></a>
<a id='line_1987'>23:6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is</a>
<a id='line_1988'>written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside</a>
<a id='line_1989'>therefrom to the right hand or to the left; 23:7 That ye come not</a>
<a id='line_1990'>among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention</a>
<a id='line_1991'>of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve</a>
<a id='line_1992'>them, nor bow yourselves unto them: 23:8 But cleave unto the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_1993'>God, as ye have done unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1994'></a>
<a id='line_1995'>23:9 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and</a>
<a id='line_1996'>strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto</a>
<a id='line_1997'>this day.</a>
<a id='line_1998'></a>
<a id='line_1999'>23:10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he</a>
<a id='line_2000'>it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</a>
<a id='line_2001'></a>
<a id='line_2002'>23:11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2003'>your God.</a>
<a id='line_2004'></a>
<a id='line_2005'>23:12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant</a>
<a id='line_2006'>of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make</a>
<a id='line_2007'>marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 23:13 Know</a>
<a id='line_2008'>for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of</a>
<a id='line_2009'>these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto</a>
<a id='line_2010'>you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye</a>
<a id='line_2011'>perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</a>
<a id='line_2012'></a>
<a id='line_2013'>23:14 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and</a>
<a id='line_2014'>ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing</a>
<a id='line_2015'>hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake</a>
<a id='line_2016'>concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath</a>
<a id='line_2017'>failed thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2018'></a>
<a id='line_2019'>23:15 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are</a>
<a id='line_2020'>come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2021'>bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off</a>
<a id='line_2022'>this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>23:16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed</a>
<a id='line_2026'>yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled</a>
<a id='line_2027'>against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which</a>
<a id='line_2028'>he hath given unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2029'></a>
<a id='line_2030'>24:1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and</a>
<a id='line_2031'>called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their</a>
<a id='line_2032'>judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before</a>
<a id='line_2033'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2034'></a>
<a id='line_2035'>24:2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of</a>

<a id='line_2038'>served other gods.</a>
<a id='line_2039'></a>
<a id='line_2040'>24:3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,</a>
<a id='line_2041'>and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his</a>
<a id='line_2042'>seed, and gave him Isaac.</a>
<a id='line_2043'></a>
<a id='line_2044'>24:4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount</a>
<a id='line_2045'>Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_2046'></a>
<a id='line_2047'>24:5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to</a>
<a id='line_2048'>that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</a>
<a id='line_2049'></a>
<a id='line_2050'>24:6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the</a>
<a id='line_2051'>sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and</a>

<a id='line_2053'></a>
<a id='line_2054'>24:7 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you</a>

<a id='line_2056'>and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the</a>
<a id='line_2057'>wilderness a long season.</a>
<a id='line_2058'></a>
<a id='line_2059'>24:8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on</a>
<a id='line_2060'>the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into</a>

<a id='line_2066'>you: 24:10 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed</a>
<a id='line_2067'>you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.</a>
<a id='line_2068'></a>
<a id='line_2069'>24:11 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of</a>
<a id='line_2070'>Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the</a>
<a id='line_2071'>Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and</a>
<a id='line_2072'>the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</a>
<a id='line_2073'></a>
<a id='line_2074'>24:12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from</a>
<a id='line_2075'>before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy</a>
<a id='line_2076'>sword, nor with thy bow.</a>
<a id='line_2077'></a>
<a id='line_2078'>24:13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and</a>
<a id='line_2079'>cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and</a>
<a id='line_2080'>oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</a>
<a id='line_2081'></a>
<a id='line_2082'>24:14 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in</a>
<a id='line_2083'>truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other</a>
<a id='line_2084'>side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2085'></a>
<a id='line_2086'>24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this</a>
<a id='line_2087'>day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served</a>
<a id='line_2088'>that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites,</a>
<a id='line_2089'>in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the</a>
<a id='line_2090'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2091'></a>
<a id='line_2092'>24:16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should</a>
<a id='line_2093'>forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; 24:17 For the LORD our God, he</a>
<a id='line_2094'>it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_2095'>from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our</a>
<a id='line_2096'>sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all</a>
<a id='line_2097'>the people through whom we passed: 24:18 And the LORD drave out from</a>
<a id='line_2098'>before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land:</a>
<a id='line_2099'>therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.</a>
<a id='line_2100'></a>
<a id='line_2101'>24:19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for</a>
<a id='line_2102'>he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your</a>
<a id='line_2103'>transgressions nor your sins.</a>
<a id='line_2104'></a>
<a id='line_2105'>24:20 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will</a>
<a id='line_2106'>turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you</a>
<a id='line_2107'>good.</a>
<a id='line_2108'></a>
<a id='line_2109'>24:21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2111'></a>
<a id='line_2112'>24:22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against</a>
<a id='line_2113'>yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they</a>
<a id='line_2114'>said, We are witnesses.</a>
<a id='line_2115'></a>
<a id='line_2116'>24:23 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are</a>
<a id='line_2117'>among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2118'></a>
<a id='line_2119'>24:24 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,</a>
<a id='line_2120'>and his voice will we obey.</a>
<a id='line_2121'></a>
<a id='line_2122'>24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them</a>
<a id='line_2123'>a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</a>
<a id='line_2124'></a>
<a id='line_2125'>24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and</a>
<a id='line_2126'>took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the</a>
<a id='line_2127'>sanctuary of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2128'></a>
<a id='line_2129'>24:27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be</a>
<a id='line_2130'>a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which</a>
<a id='line_2131'>he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye</a>
<a id='line_2132'>deny your God.</a>
<a id='line_2133'></a>
<a id='line_2134'>24:28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_2135'></a>
<a id='line_2136'>24:29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of</a>
<a id='line_2137'>Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years</a>
<a id='line_2138'>old.</a>
<a id='line_2139'></a>
<a id='line_2140'>24:30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in</a>
<a id='line_2141'>Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill</a>
<a id='line_2142'>of Gaash.</a>
<a id='line_2143'></a>
<a id='line_2144'>24:31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the</a>
<a id='line_2145'>days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the</a>
<a id='line_2146'>works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2147'></a>
<a id='line_2148'>24:32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up</a>
<a id='line_2149'>out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which</a>
<a id='line_2150'>Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred</a>
<a id='line_2151'>pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of</a>
<a id='line_2152'>Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_2153'></a>
<a id='line_2154'>24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill</a>
<a id='line_2155'>that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount</a>
<a id='line_2156'>Ephraim.</a>
