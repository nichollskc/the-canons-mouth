<a id='line_4074'>must doe: Confine her to a place, where the light may rather seeme to</a>
<a id='line_4075'>steale in, then be permitted; take vpon you (yong Sir, her friend) the</a>
<a id='line_4076'>name of Palamon; say you come to eate with her, and to commune of Love;</a>
<a id='line_4077'>this will catch her attention, for this her minde beates upon; other</a>
<a id='line_4078'>objects that are inserted tweene her minde and eye become the prankes</a>

<a id='line_4087'>play-pheeres, and let them repaire to her with Palamon in their</a>
<a id='line_4088'>mouthes, and appeare with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a</a>
<a id='line_4089'>falsehood she is in, which is with falsehood to be combated. This may</a>
<a id='line_4090'>bring her to eate, to sleepe, and reduce what's now out of square in</a>

<a id='line_5060'>Would make his length a mile, if't pleas'd his Rider</a>
<a id='line_5061'>To put pride in him: as he thus went counting</a>
<a id='line_5062'>The flinty pavement, dancing, as t'wer, to'th Musicke</a>

<a id='line_5065'>Cold as old Saturne, and like him possest</a>
<a id='line_5066'>With fire malevolent, darted a Sparke,</a>
<a id='line_5067'>Or what feirce sulphur else, to this end made,</a>

<a id='line_5071'>Forgets schoole dooing, being therein traind,</a>

<a id='line_5075'>Of boystrous and rough Iadrie, to dis-seate</a>
<a id='line_5076'>His Lord, that kept it bravely: when nought serv'd,</a>
<a id='line_5077'>When neither Curb would cracke, girth breake nor diffring plunges</a>
<a id='line_5078'>Dis-roote his Rider whence he grew, but that</a>
<a id='line_5079'>He kept him tweene his legges, on his hind hoofes on end he stands,</a>
<a id='line_5080'>That Arcites leggs, being higher then his head,</a>
<a id='line_5081'>Seem'd with strange art to hand: His victors wreath</a>
<a id='line_5082'>Even then fell off his head: and presently</a>
<a id='line_5083'>Backeward the Iade comes ore, and his full poyze</a>
<a id='line_5084'>Becomes the Riders loade: yet is he living,</a>
<a id='line_5085'>But such a vessell tis, that floates but for</a>
<a id='line_5086'>The surge that next approaches: he much desires</a>
<a id='line_5087'>To have some speech with you: Loe he appeares.</a>
