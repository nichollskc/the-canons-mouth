<a id='line_88'>FLAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_89'>Hence! home, you idle creatures, get you home.</a>
<a id='line_90'>Is this a holiday? What, know you not,</a>
<a id='line_91'>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</a>
<a id='line_92'>Upon a labouring day without the sign</a>

<a id='line_131'>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no</a>
<a id='line_132'>tradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters, but withal I am indeed, sir,</a>
<a id='line_133'>a surgeon to old shoes: when they are in great danger, I recover them.</a>

<a id='line_146'>MARULLUS.</a>
<a id='line_147'>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</a>
<a id='line_148'>What tributaries follow him to Rome,</a>
<a id='line_149'>To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?</a>
<a id='line_150'>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</a>
<a id='line_151'>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_152'>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</a>
<a id='line_153'>Have you climb’d up to walls and battlements,</a>
<a id='line_154'>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,</a>
<a id='line_155'>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</a>
<a id='line_156'>The livelong day with patient expectation,</a>
<a id='line_157'>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_158'>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Have you not made an universal shout,</a>
<a id='line_160'>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks</a>
<a id='line_161'>To hear the replication of your sounds</a>
<a id='line_162'>Made in her concave shores?</a>
<a id='line_163'>And do you now put on your best attire?</a>
<a id='line_164'>And do you now cull out a holiday?</a>
<a id='line_165'>And do you now strew flowers in his way,</a>
<a id='line_166'>That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?</a>
<a id='line_167'>Be gone!</a>
<a id='line_168'>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</a>
<a id='line_169'>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</a>
<a id='line_170'>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>FLAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_173'>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault</a>
<a id='line_174'>Assemble all the poor men of your sort,</a>
<a id='line_175'>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</a>
<a id='line_176'>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</a>
<a id='line_177'>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>

<a id='line_181'>See whether their basest metal be not mov’d;</a>
<a id='line_182'>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</a>
<a id='line_183'>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</a>
<a id='line_184'>This way will I. Disrobe the images,</a>
<a id='line_185'>If you do find them deck’d with ceremonies.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>MARULLUS.</a>
<a id='line_188'>May we do so?</a>
<a id='line_189'>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>FLAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_192'>It is no matter; let no images</a>
<a id='line_193'>Be hung with Caesar’s trophies. I’ll about</a>
<a id='line_194'>And drive away the vulgar from the streets;</a>
<a id='line_195'>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</a>
<a id='line_196'>These growing feathers pluck’d from Caesar’s wing</a>
<a id='line_197'>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</a>
<a id='line_198'>Who else would soar above the view of men,</a>
<a id='line_199'>And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</a>

<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_303'>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</a>
<a id='line_304'>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</a>
<a id='line_305'>And show of love as I was wont to have.</a>
<a id='line_306'>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</a>
<a id='line_307'>Over your friend that loves you.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_310'>Cassius,</a>
<a id='line_311'>Be not deceived: if I have veil’d my look,</a>
<a id='line_312'>I turn the trouble of my countenance</a>
<a id='line_313'>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</a>
<a id='line_314'>Of late with passions of some difference,</a>
<a id='line_315'>Conceptions only proper to myself,</a>
<a id='line_316'>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</a>
<a id='line_317'>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved</a>
<a id='line_318'>(Among which number, Cassius, be you one)</a>
<a id='line_319'>Nor construe any further my neglect,</a>
<a id='line_320'>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</a>
<a id='line_321'>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_324'>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</a>
<a id='line_325'>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</a>
<a id='line_326'>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</a>
<a id='line_327'>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_330'>No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself</a>
<a id='line_331'>But by reflection, by some other thing.</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_334'>’Tis just:</a>
<a id='line_335'>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</a>
<a id='line_336'>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</a>
<a id='line_337'>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</a>
<a id='line_338'>That you might see your shadow. I have heard</a>
<a id='line_339'>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</a>
<a id='line_340'>(Except immortal Caesar) speaking of Brutus,</a>
<a id='line_341'>And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,</a>
<a id='line_342'>Have wish’d that noble Brutus had his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_345'>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</a>
<a id='line_346'>That you would have me seek into myself</a>
<a id='line_347'>For that which is not in me?</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_350'>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear;</a>
<a id='line_351'>And since you know you cannot see yourself</a>
<a id='line_352'>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</a>
<a id='line_353'>Will modestly discover to yourself</a>
<a id='line_354'>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</a>
<a id='line_355'>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</a>
<a id='line_356'>Were I a common laugher, or did use</a>
<a id='line_357'>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</a>
<a id='line_358'>To every new protester; if you know</a>
<a id='line_359'>That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,</a>
<a id='line_360'>And after scandal them; or if you know</a>
<a id='line_361'>That I profess myself in banqueting,</a>
<a id='line_362'>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'> [_Flourish and shout._]</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_367'>What means this shouting? I do fear the people</a>
<a id='line_368'>Choose Caesar for their king.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_371'>Ay, do you fear it?</a>
<a id='line_372'>Then must I think you would not have it so.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_375'>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well,</a>
<a id='line_376'>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</a>
<a id='line_377'>What is it that you would impart to me?</a>
<a id='line_378'>If it be aught toward the general good,</a>
<a id='line_379'>Set honour in one eye and death i’ the other,</a>
<a id='line_380'>And I will look on both indifferently;</a>
<a id='line_381'>For let the gods so speed me as I love</a>
<a id='line_382'>The name of honour more than I fear death.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_385'>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</a>
<a id='line_386'>As well as I do know your outward favour.</a>
<a id='line_387'>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</a>
<a id='line_388'>I cannot tell what you and other men</a>
<a id='line_389'>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</a>
<a id='line_390'>I had as lief not be as live to be</a>
<a id='line_391'>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</a>
<a id='line_392'>I was born free as Caesar; so were you;</a>
<a id='line_393'>We both have fed as well, and we can both</a>
<a id='line_394'>Endure the winter’s cold as well as he:</a>
<a id='line_395'>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</a>
<a id='line_396'>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</a>
<a id='line_397'>Caesar said to me, “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now</a>
<a id='line_398'>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</a>
<a id='line_399'>And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</a>
<a id='line_400'>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,</a>
<a id='line_401'>And bade him follow: so indeed he did.</a>
<a id='line_402'>The torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it</a>
<a id='line_403'>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</a>
<a id='line_404'>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.</a>
<a id='line_405'>But ere we could arrive the point propos’d,</a>
<a id='line_406'>Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”</a>
<a id='line_407'>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</a>
<a id='line_408'>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</a>
<a id='line_409'>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</a>
<a id='line_410'>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</a>
<a id='line_411'>Is now become a god; and Cassius is</a>
<a id='line_412'>A wretched creature, and must bend his body,</a>
<a id='line_413'>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</a>
<a id='line_414'>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</a>
<a id='line_415'>And when the fit was on him I did mark</a>
<a id='line_416'>How he did shake: ’tis true, this god did shake:</a>
<a id='line_417'>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</a>
<a id='line_418'>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</a>
<a id='line_419'>Did lose his lustre. I did hear him groan:</a>
<a id='line_420'>Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans</a>
<a id='line_421'>Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,</a>
<a id='line_422'>Alas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”</a>
<a id='line_423'>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,</a>
<a id='line_424'>A man of such a feeble temper should</a>
<a id='line_425'>So get the start of the majestic world,</a>
<a id='line_426'>And bear the palm alone.</a>

<a id='line_433'>For some new honours that are heap’d on Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_436'>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</a>
<a id='line_437'>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</a>
<a id='line_438'>Walk under his huge legs, and peep about</a>
<a id='line_439'>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</a>
<a id='line_440'>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</a>
<a id='line_441'>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</a>
<a id='line_442'>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</a>
<a id='line_443'>“Brutus” and “Caesar”: what should be in that “Caesar”?</a>
<a id='line_444'>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</a>
<a id='line_445'>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</a>
<a id='line_446'>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</a>
<a id='line_447'>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,</a>
<a id='line_448'>“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”</a>
<a id='line_449'>Now in the names of all the gods at once,</a>
<a id='line_450'>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</a>
<a id='line_451'>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!</a>
<a id='line_452'>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</a>
<a id='line_453'>When went there by an age since the great flood,</a>
<a id='line_454'>But it was fam’d with more than with one man?</a>
<a id='line_455'>When could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_456'>That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?</a>
<a id='line_457'>Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,</a>
<a id='line_458'>When there is in it but one only man.</a>
<a id='line_459'>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</a>
<a id='line_460'>There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d</a>
<a id='line_461'>Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,</a>

<a id='line_468'>I shall recount hereafter. For this present,</a>
<a id='line_469'>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</a>
<a id='line_470'>Be any further mov’d. What you have said,</a>
<a id='line_471'>I will consider; what you have to say</a>
<a id='line_472'>I will with patience hear; and find a time</a>
<a id='line_473'>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</a>
<a id='line_474'>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</a>
<a id='line_475'>Brutus had rather be a villager</a>
<a id='line_476'>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</a>
<a id='line_477'>Under these hard conditions as this time</a>
<a id='line_478'>Is like to lay upon us.</a>

<a id='line_495'>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</a>
<a id='line_496'>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,</a>
<a id='line_497'>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</a>
<a id='line_498'>Calphurnia’s cheek is pale; and Cicero</a>
<a id='line_499'>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</a>

<a id='line_502'></a>
<a id='line_503'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_504'>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</a>

<a id='line_514'>Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights:</a>
<a id='line_515'>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</a>

<a id='line_524'>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</a>
<a id='line_525'>I do not know the man I should avoid</a>
<a id='line_526'>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,</a>
<a id='line_527'>He is a great observer, and he looks</a>
<a id='line_528'>Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,</a>
<a id='line_529'>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.</a>
<a id='line_530'>Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort</a>
<a id='line_531'>As if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit</a>
<a id='line_532'>That could be mov’d to smile at anything.</a>
<a id='line_533'>Such men as he be never at heart’s ease</a>
<a id='line_534'>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</a>
<a id='line_535'>And therefore are they very dangerous.</a>
<a id='line_536'>I rather tell thee what is to be fear’d</a>
<a id='line_537'>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_538'>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</a>

<a id='line_555'></a>

<a id='line_557'>Why, there was a crown offer’d him; and being offer’d him, he put it by</a>

<a id='line_571'></a>
<a id='line_572'>BRUTUS.</a>

<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_576'>Ay, marry, was’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than</a>

<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_580'>Who offer’d him the crown?</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>

<a id='line_583'>Why, Antony.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_586'>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</a>
<a id='line_587'></a>
<a id='line_588'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_589'>I can as well be hang’d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery;</a>
<a id='line_590'>I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet ’twas not a</a>
<a id='line_591'>crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put</a>
<a id='line_592'>it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had</a>
<a id='line_593'>it. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: but, to</a>
<a id='line_594'>my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he</a>
<a id='line_595'>offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as</a>
<a id='line_596'>he refus’d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp’d their chopt hands,</a>
<a id='line_597'>and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of</a>
<a id='line_598'>stinking breath because Caesar refus’d the crown, that it had, almost,</a>
<a id='line_599'>choked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own</a>
<a id='line_600'>part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the</a>
<a id='line_601'>bad air.</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_604'>But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_607'>He fell down in the market-place, and foam’d at mouth, and was</a>
<a id='line_608'>speechless.</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_611'>’Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_614'>No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I,</a>
<a id='line_615'>And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness.</a>
<a id='line_616'></a>
<a id='line_617'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_618'>I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down. If</a>
<a id='line_619'>the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he</a>
<a id='line_620'>pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the</a>
<a id='line_621'>theatre, I am no true man.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_624'>What said he when he came unto himself?</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_627'>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad</a>
<a id='line_628'>he refused the crown, he pluck’d me ope his doublet, and offer’d them</a>
<a id='line_629'>his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would</a>
<a id='line_630'>not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the</a>
<a id='line_631'>rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he</a>
<a id='line_632'>had done or said anything amiss, he desir’d their worships to think it</a>
<a id='line_633'>was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas,</a>
<a id='line_634'>good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed</a>
<a id='line_635'>to be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb’d their mothers, they would</a>
<a id='line_636'>have done no less.</a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_639'>And, after that, he came thus sad away?</a>

<a id='line_642'>Ay.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>

<a id='line_645'>Did Cicero say anything?</a>
<a id='line_646'></a>
<a id='line_647'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_648'>Ay, he spoke Greek.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_651'>To what effect?</a>
<a id='line_652'></a>
<a id='line_653'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_654'>Nay, and I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again. But</a>
<a id='line_655'>those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads;</a>
<a id='line_656'>but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news</a>
<a id='line_657'>too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are</a>
<a id='line_658'>put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</a>

<a id='line_759'>Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.</a>
<a id='line_760'>And yesterday the bird of night did sit,</a>
<a id='line_761'>Even at noonday upon the marketplace,</a>
<a id='line_762'>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</a>

<a id='line_800'></a>
<a id='line_801'>CASSIUS.</a>

<a id='line_807'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_808'>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</a>
<a id='line_809'>For my part, I have walk’d about the streets,</a>
<a id='line_810'>Submitting me unto the perilous night;</a>
<a id='line_811'>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</a>
<a id='line_812'>Have bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;</a>
<a id='line_813'>And when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open</a>
<a id='line_814'>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</a>
<a id='line_815'>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_818'>But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens?</a>
<a id='line_819'>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</a>
<a id='line_820'>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</a>
<a id='line_821'>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_824'>You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life</a>
<a id='line_825'>That should be in a Roman you do want,</a>
<a id='line_826'>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze,</a>
<a id='line_827'>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</a>
<a id='line_828'>To see the strange impatience of the Heavens:</a>
<a id='line_829'>But if you would consider the true cause</a>
<a id='line_830'>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</a>
<a id='line_831'>Why birds and beasts, from quality and kind;</a>
<a id='line_832'>Why old men, fools, and children calculate,</a>
<a id='line_833'>Why all these things change from their ordinance,</a>
<a id='line_834'>Their natures, and pre-formed faculties,</a>
<a id='line_835'>To monstrous quality; why, you shall find</a>
<a id='line_836'>That Heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,</a>
<a id='line_837'>To make them instruments of fear and warning</a>
<a id='line_838'>Unto some monstrous state.</a>
<a id='line_839'>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</a>
<a id='line_840'>Most like this dreadful night,</a>
<a id='line_841'>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars,</a>
<a id='line_842'>As doth the lion in the Capitol;</a>
<a id='line_843'>A man no mightier than thyself, or me,</a>
<a id='line_844'>In personal action; yet prodigious grown,</a>
<a id='line_845'>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_848'>’Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</a>
<a id='line_849'></a>
<a id='line_850'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_851'>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</a>
<a id='line_852'>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</a>
<a id='line_853'>But, woe the while! our fathers’ minds are dead,</a>
<a id='line_854'>And we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;</a>
<a id='line_855'>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_858'>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</a>
<a id='line_859'>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</a>
<a id='line_860'>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</a>
<a id='line_861'>In every place, save here in Italy.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_864'>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</a>
<a id='line_865'>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</a>
<a id='line_866'>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</a>
<a id='line_867'>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.</a>
<a id='line_868'>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</a>
<a id='line_869'>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</a>
<a id='line_870'>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</a>
<a id='line_871'>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</a>
<a id='line_872'>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</a>
<a id='line_873'>If I know this, know all the world besides,</a>
<a id='line_874'>That part of tyranny that I do bear</a>
<a id='line_875'>I can shake off at pleasure.</a>

<a id='line_877'> [_Thunder still._]</a>
<a id='line_878'></a>
<a id='line_879'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_880'>So can I:</a>
<a id='line_881'>So every bondman in his own hand bears</a>
<a id='line_882'>The power to cancel his captivity.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_885'>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</a>
<a id='line_886'>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</a>
<a id='line_887'>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</a>
<a id='line_888'>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</a>
<a id='line_889'>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</a>
<a id='line_890'>Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,</a>
<a id='line_891'>What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves</a>
<a id='line_892'>For the base matter to illuminate</a>
<a id='line_893'>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</a>
<a id='line_894'>Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this</a>
<a id='line_895'>Before a willing bondman: then I know</a>
<a id='line_896'>My answer must be made; but I am arm’d,</a>
<a id='line_897'>And dangers are to me indifferent.</a>
<a id='line_898'></a>
<a id='line_899'>CASCA.</a>
<a id='line_900'>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</a>
<a id='line_901'>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</a>
<a id='line_902'>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</a>
<a id='line_903'>And I will set this foot of mine as far</a>
<a id='line_904'>As who goes farthest.</a>
<a id='line_905'></a>
<a id='line_906'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_907'>There’s a bargain made.</a>
<a id='line_908'>Now know you, Casca, I have mov’d already</a>

<a id='line_910'>To undergo with me an enterprise</a>
<a id='line_911'>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</a>
<a id='line_912'>And I do know by this, they stay for me</a>

<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>CINNA.</a>
<a id='line_936'>I am glad on’t. What a fearful night is this!</a>

<a id='line_945'></a>
<a id='line_946'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_947'>Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,</a>
<a id='line_948'>And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,</a>
<a id='line_949'>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</a>
<a id='line_950'>In at his window; set this up with wax</a>
<a id='line_951'>Upon old Brutus’ statue: all this done,</a>

<a id='line_955'>CINNA.</a>
<a id='line_956'>All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone</a>
<a id='line_957'>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,</a>

<a id='line_959'></a>
<a id='line_960'>CASSIUS.</a>

<a id='line_1015'>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</a>

<a id='line_1017'>How that might change his nature, there’s the question.</a>
<a id='line_1018'>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,</a>
<a id='line_1019'>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that;</a>

<a id='line_1022'>Th’ abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</a>

<a id='line_1024'>I have not known when his affections sway’d</a>
<a id='line_1025'>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof,</a>

<a id='line_1033'>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</a>
<a id='line_1034'>Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,</a>
<a id='line_1035'>Would run to these and these extremities:</a>

<a id='line_1277'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_1278'>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</a>
<a id='line_1279'>To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,</a>
<a id='line_1280'>Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards;</a>
<a id='line_1281'>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_1282'>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</a>
<a id='line_1283'>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,</a>
<a id='line_1284'>And in the spirit of men there is no blood.</a>
<a id='line_1285'>O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit,</a>
<a id='line_1286'>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</a>
<a id='line_1289'>Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</a>
<a id='line_1290'>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.</a>
<a id='line_1291'>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</a>
<a id='line_1292'>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</a>
<a id='line_1293'>And after seem to chide ’em. This shall mark</a>

<a id='line_1295'>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1296'>We shall be call’d purgers, not murderers.</a>
<a id='line_1297'>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</a>
<a id='line_1298'>For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm</a>
<a id='line_1299'>When Caesar’s head is off.</a>

<a id='line_1301'>CASSIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1302'>Yet I fear him;</a>

<a id='line_1304'></a>
<a id='line_1305'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_1306'>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</a>
<a id='line_1307'>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</a>
<a id='line_1308'>Is to himself; take thought and die for Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_1309'>And that were much he should; for he is given</a>
<a id='line_1310'>To sports, to wildness, and much company.</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>TREBONIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1313'>There is no fear in him; let him not die;</a>

<a id='line_1328'>But it is doubtful yet</a>
<a id='line_1329'>Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;</a>

<a id='line_1331'>Quite from the main opinion he held once</a>
<a id='line_1332'>Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.</a>
<a id='line_1333'>It may be these apparent prodigies,</a>
<a id='line_1334'>The unaccustom’d terror of this night,</a>
<a id='line_1335'>And the persuasion of his augurers,</a>

<a id='line_1337'></a>
<a id='line_1338'>DECIUS.</a>
<a id='line_1339'>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear</a>
<a id='line_1341'>That unicorns may be betray’d with trees,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</a>
<a id='line_1343'>Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.</a>
<a id='line_1344'>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</a>
<a id='line_1345'>He says he does, being then most flattered.</a>
<a id='line_1346'>Let me work;</a>
<a id='line_1347'>For I can give his humour the true bent,</a>
<a id='line_1348'>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</a>

<a id='line_1350'>CASSIUS.</a>

<a id='line_1405'>You star’d upon me with ungentle looks.</a>
<a id='line_1406'>I urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,</a>
<a id='line_1407'>And too impatiently stamp’d with your foot;</a>
<a id='line_1408'>Yet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,</a>
<a id='line_1409'>But with an angry wafture of your hand</a>

<a id='line_2479'>but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die</a>
<a id='line_2480'>all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar</a>
<a id='line_2481'>loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he</a>

<a id='line_4564'>Hence! I will follow.</a>
<a id='line_4565'></a>
<a id='line_4566'> [_Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius and Volumnius._]</a>
<a id='line_4567'></a>
<a id='line_4568'>I pr’ythee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.</a>
<a id='line_4569'>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</a>
<a id='line_4570'>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it.</a>
<a id='line_4571'>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</a>
<a id='line_4572'>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</a>
<a id='line_4573'></a>
<a id='line_4574'>STRATO.</a>
<a id='line_4575'>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_4576'></a>
<a id='line_4577'>BRUTUS.</a>
<a id='line_4578'>Farewell, good Strato.—Caesar, now be still:</a>
<a id='line_4579'>I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.</a>
<a id='line_4580'></a>
<a id='line_4581'> [_He runs on his sword, and dies._]</a>
<a id='line_4582'></a>
<a id='line_4583'> Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius and the</a>
<a id='line_4584'> Army.</a>
<a id='line_4585'></a>
<a id='line_4586'>OCTAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_4587'>What man is that?</a>
<a id='line_4588'></a>
<a id='line_4589'>MESSALA.</a>
<a id='line_4590'>My master’s man. Strato, where is thy master?</a>
<a id='line_4591'></a>
<a id='line_4592'>STRATO.</a>
<a id='line_4593'>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.</a>
<a id='line_4594'>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</a>
<a id='line_4595'>For Brutus only overcame himself,</a>
<a id='line_4596'>And no man else hath honour by his death.</a>
<a id='line_4597'></a>
<a id='line_4598'>LUCILIUS.</a>
<a id='line_4599'>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</a>
<a id='line_4600'>That thou hast prov’d Lucilius’ saying true.</a>
<a id='line_4601'></a>
<a id='line_4602'>OCTAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_4603'>All that serv’d Brutus, I will entertain them.</a>
<a id='line_4604'>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</a>
<a id='line_4605'></a>
<a id='line_4606'>STRATO.</a>
<a id='line_4607'>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</a>
<a id='line_4608'></a>
<a id='line_4609'>OCTAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_4610'>Do so, good Messala.</a>
<a id='line_4611'></a>
<a id='line_4612'>MESSALA.</a>
<a id='line_4613'>How died my master, Strato?</a>
<a id='line_4614'></a>
<a id='line_4615'>STRATO.</a>
<a id='line_4616'>I held the sword, and he did run on it.</a>
<a id='line_4617'></a>
<a id='line_4618'>MESSALA.</a>
<a id='line_4619'>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</a>
<a id='line_4620'>That did the latest service to my master.</a>
<a id='line_4621'></a>
<a id='line_4622'>ANTONY.</a>
<a id='line_4623'>This was the noblest Roman of them all.</a>
<a id='line_4624'>All the conspirators save only he,</a>
<a id='line_4625'>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</a>
<a id='line_4626'>He only, in a general honest thought</a>
<a id='line_4627'>And common good to all, made one of them.</a>
<a id='line_4628'>His life was gentle, and the elements</a>
<a id='line_4629'>So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up</a>
<a id='line_4630'>And say to all the world, “This was a man!”</a>
<a id='line_4631'></a>
<a id='line_4632'>OCTAVIUS.</a>
<a id='line_4633'>According to his virtue let us use him</a>
<a id='line_4634'>With all respect and rites of burial.</a>
<a id='line_4635'>Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,</a>
<a id='line_4636'>Most like a soldier, order’d honourably.</a>
<a id='line_4637'>So call the field to rest, and let’s away,</a>
<a id='line_4638'>To part the glories of this happy day.</a>
