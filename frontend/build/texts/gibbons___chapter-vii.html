<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the</a>
<a id='line_10'>      world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope</a>
<a id='line_11'>      for ridicule. Is it possible to relate without an indignant</a>
<a id='line_12'>      smile, that, on the father’s decease, the property of a nation,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      like that of a drove of oxen, descends to his infant son, as yet</a>
<a id='line_14'>      unknown to mankind and to himself; and that the bravest warriors</a>
<a id='line_15'>      and the wisest statesmen, relinquishing their natural right to</a>
<a id='line_16'>      empire, approach the royal cradle with bended knees and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      protestations of inviolable fidelity? Satire and declamation may</a>
<a id='line_18'>      paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colors, but our</a>
<a id='line_19'>      more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice, that</a>
<a id='line_20'>      establishes a rule of succession, independent of the passions of</a>
<a id='line_21'>      mankind; and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which</a>
<a id='line_22'>      deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal,</a>
<a id='line_23'>      power of giving themselves a master.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>      In the cool shade of retirement, we may easily devise imaginary</a>
<a id='line_26'>      forms of government, in which the sceptre shall be constantly</a>
<a id='line_27'>      bestowed on the most worthy, by the free and incorrupt suffrage</a>
<a id='line_28'>      of the whole community. Experience overturns these airy fabrics,</a>
<a id='line_29'>      and teaches us, that in a large society, the election of a</a>
<a id='line_30'>      monarch can never devolve to the wisest, or to the most numerous</a>
<a id='line_31'>      part of the people. The army is the only order of men</a>
<a id='line_32'>      sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments, and</a>
<a id='line_33'>      powerful enough to impose them on the rest of their</a>
<a id='line_34'>      fellow-citizens; but the temper of soldiers, habituated at once</a>
<a id='line_35'>      to violence and to slavery, renders them very unfit guardians of</a>
<a id='line_36'>      a legal, or even a civil constitution. Justice, humanity, or</a>
<a id='line_37'>      political wisdom, are qualities they are too little acquainted</a>
<a id='line_38'>      with in themselves, to appreciate them in others. Valor will</a>
<a id='line_39'>      acquire their esteem, and liberality will purchase their</a>
<a id='line_40'>      suffrage; but the first of these merits is often lodged in the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      most savage breasts; the latter can only exert itself at the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      expense of the public; and both may be turned against the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      possessor of the throne, by the ambition of a daring rival.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>      The superior prerogative of birth, when it has obtained the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      sanction of time and popular opinion, is the plainest and least</a>
<a id='line_47'>      invidious of all distinctions among mankind. The acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_48'>      right extinguishes the hopes of faction, and the conscious</a>
<a id='line_49'>      security disarms the cruelty of the monarch. To the firm</a>
<a id='line_50'>      establishment of this idea we owe the peaceful succession and</a>
<a id='line_51'>      mild administration of European monarchies. To the defect of it</a>
<a id='line_52'>      we must attribute the frequent civil wars, through which an</a>
<a id='line_53'>      Asiatic despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his</a>
<a id='line_54'>      fathers. Yet, even in the East, the sphere of contention is</a>
<a id='line_55'>      usually limited to the princes of the reigning house, and as soon</a>
<a id='line_56'>      as the more fortunate competitor has removed his brethren by the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      sword and the bowstring, he no longer entertains any jealousy of</a>
<a id='line_58'>      his meaner subjects. But the Roman empire, after the authority of</a>
<a id='line_59'>      the senate had sunk into contempt, was a vast scene of confusion.</a>
<a id='line_60'>      The royal, and even noble, families of the provinces had long</a>
<a id='line_61'>      since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty</a>
<a id='line_62'>      republicans. The ancient families of Rome had successively fallen</a>
<a id='line_63'>      beneath the tyranny of the Cæsars; and whilst those princes were</a>
<a id='line_64'>      shackled by the forms of a commonwealth, and disappointed by the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      repeated failure of their posterity, 1 it was impossible that any</a>
<a id='line_66'>      idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds</a>
<a id='line_67'>      of their subjects. The right to the throne, which none could</a>
<a id='line_68'>      claim from birth, every one assumed from merit. The daring hopes</a>
<a id='line_69'>      of ambition were set loose from the salutary restraints of law</a>
<a id='line_70'>      and prejudice; and the meanest of mankind might, without folly,</a>
<a id='line_71'>      entertain a hope of being raised by valor and fortune to a rank</a>
<a id='line_72'>      in the army, in which a single crime would enable him to wrest</a>
<a id='line_73'>      the sceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular master.</a>
<a id='line_74'>      After the murder of Alexander Severus, and the elevation of</a>
<a id='line_75'>      Maximin, no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne, and</a>
<a id='line_76'>      every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that</a>
<a id='line_77'>      august, but dangerous station.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>      1 (return) [ There had been no example of three successive</a>
<a id='line_80'>      generations on the throne; only three instances of sons who</a>
<a id='line_81'>      succeeded their fathers. The marriages of the Cæsars</a>
<a id='line_82'>      (notwithstanding the permission, and the frequent practice of</a>
<a id='line_83'>      divorces) were generally unfruitful.]</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>      About thirty-two years before that event, the emperor Severus,</a>
<a id='line_86'>      returning from an eastern expedition, halted in Thrace, to</a>
<a id='line_87'>      celebrate, with military games, the birthday of his younger son,</a>
<a id='line_88'>      Geta. The country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_89'>      and a young barbarian of gigantic stature earnestly solicited, in</a>
<a id='line_90'>      his rude dialect, that he might be allowed to contend for the</a>
<a id='line_91'>      prize of wrestling. As the pride of discipline would have been</a>
<a id='line_92'>      disgraced in the overthrow of a Roman soldier by a Thracian</a>
<a id='line_93'>      peasant, he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp,</a>
<a id='line_94'>      sixteen of whom he successively laid on the ground. His victory</a>
<a id='line_95'>      was rewarded by some trifling gifts, and a permission to enlist</a>
<a id='line_96'>      in the troops. The next day, the happy barbarian was</a>
<a id='line_97'>      distinguished above a crowd of recruits, dancing and exulting</a>
<a id='line_98'>      after the fashion of his country. As soon as he perceived that he</a>
<a id='line_99'>      had attracted the emperor’s notice, he instantly ran up to his</a>
<a id='line_100'>      horse, and followed him on foot, without the least appearance of</a>
<a id='line_101'>      fatigue, in a long and rapid career. “Thracian,” said Severus</a>
<a id='line_102'>      with astonishment, “art thou disposed to wrestle after thy race?”</a>
<a id='line_103'>      “Most willingly, sir,” replied the unwearied youth; and, almost</a>
<a id='line_104'>      in a breath, overthrew seven of the strongest soldiers in the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      army. A gold collar was the prize of his matchless vigor and</a>
<a id='line_106'>      activity, and he was immediately appointed to serve in the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      horseguards who always attended on the person of the sovereign. 2</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>      2 (return) [ Hist. August p. 138.]</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>      Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories of</a>
<a id='line_112'>      the empire, descended from a mixed race of barbarians. His father</a>
<a id='line_113'>      was a Goth, and his mother of the nation of the Alani. He</a>
<a id='line_114'>      displayed on every occasion a valor equal to his strength; and</a>
<a id='line_115'>      his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the</a>
<a id='line_116'>      knowledge of the world. Under the reign of Severus and his son,</a>
<a id='line_117'>      he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favor and esteem of</a>
<a id='line_118'>      both those princes, the former of whom was an excellent judge of</a>
<a id='line_119'>      merit. Gratitude forbade Maximin to serve under the assassin of</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Caracalla. Honor taught him to decline the effeminate insults of</a>
<a id='line_121'>      Elagabalus. On the accession of Alexander he returned to court,</a>
<a id='line_122'>      and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service,</a>
<a id='line_123'>      and honorable to himself. The fourth legion, to which he was</a>
<a id='line_124'>      appointed tribune, soon became, under his care, the best</a>
<a id='line_125'>      disciplined of the whole army. With the general applause of the</a>
<a id='line_126'>      soldiers, who bestowed on their favorite hero the names of Ajax</a>
<a id='line_127'>      and Hercules, he was successively promoted to the first military</a>
<a id='line_128'>      command; 3 and had not he still retained too much of his savage</a>
<a id='line_129'>      origin, the emperor might perhaps have given his own sister in</a>
<a id='line_130'>      marriage to the son of Maximin. 4</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>      3 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 140. Herodian, l. vi. p. 223.</a>
<a id='line_133'>      Aurelius Victor. By comparing these authors, it should seem that</a>
<a id='line_134'>      Maximin had the particular command of the Tribellian horse, with</a>
<a id='line_135'>      the general commission of disciplining the recruits of the whole</a>
<a id='line_136'>      army. His biographer ought to have marked, with more care, his</a>
<a id='line_137'>      exploits, and the successive steps of his military promotions.]</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>      4 (return) [ See the original letter of Alexander Severus, Hist.</a>
<a id='line_140'>      August. p. 149.]</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>      Instead of securing his fidelity, these favors served only to</a>
<a id='line_143'>      inflame the ambition of the Thracian peasant, who deemed his</a>
<a id='line_144'>      fortune inadequate to his merit, as long as he was constrained to</a>
<a id='line_145'>      acknowledge a superior. Though a stranger to real wisdom, he was</a>
<a id='line_146'>      not devoid of a selfish cunning, which showed him that the</a>
<a id='line_147'>      emperor had lost the affection of the army, and taught him to</a>
<a id='line_148'>      improve their discontent to his own advantage. It is easy for</a>
<a id='line_149'>      faction and calumny to shed their poison on the administration of</a>
<a id='line_150'>      the best of princes, and to accuse even their virtues by artfully</a>
<a id='line_151'>      confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest</a>
<a id='line_152'>      affinity. The troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of</a>
<a id='line_153'>      Maximin. They blushed at their own ignominious patience, which,</a>
<a id='line_154'>      during thirteen years, had supported the vexatious discipline</a>
<a id='line_155'>      imposed by an effeminate Syrian, the timid slave of his mother</a>
<a id='line_156'>      and of the senate. It was time, they cried, to cast away that</a>
<a id='line_157'>      useless phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince</a>
<a id='line_158'>      and general a real soldier, educated in camps, exercised in war,</a>
<a id='line_159'>      who would assert the glory, and distribute among his companions</a>
<a id='line_160'>      the treasures, of the empire. A great army was at that time</a>
<a id='line_161'>      assembled on the banks of the Rhine, under the command of the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      emperor himself, who, almost immediately after his return from</a>
<a id='line_163'>      the Persian war, had been obliged to march against the barbarians</a>
<a id='line_164'>      of Germany. The important care of training and reviewing the new</a>
<a id='line_165'>      levies was intrusted to Maximin. One day, as he entered the field</a>
<a id='line_166'>      of exercise, the troops, either from a sudden impulse, or a</a>
<a id='line_167'>      formed conspiracy, saluted him emperor, silenced by their loud</a>
<a id='line_168'>      acclamations his obstinate refusal, and hastened to consummate</a>
<a id='line_169'>      their rebellion by the murder of Alexander Severus.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>      The circumstances of his death are variously related. The</a>
<a id='line_172'>      writers, who suppose that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude</a>
<a id='line_173'>      and ambition of Maximin affirm that, after taking a frugal repast</a>
<a id='line_174'>      in the sight of the army, he retired to sleep, and that, about</a>
<a id='line_175'>      the seventh hour of the day, a part of his own guards broke into</a>
<a id='line_176'>      the imperial tent, and, with many wounds, assassinated their</a>
<a id='line_177'>      virtuous and unsuspecting prince. 5 If we credit another, and</a>
<a id='line_178'>      indeed a more probable account, Maximin was invested with the</a>
<a id='line_179'>      purple by a numerous detachment, at the distance of several miles</a>
<a id='line_180'>      from the head-quarters; and he trusted for success rather to the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      secret wishes than to the public declarations of the great army.</a>
<a id='line_182'>      Alexander had sufficient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty</a>
<a id='line_183'>      among the troops; but their reluctant professions of fidelity</a>
<a id='line_184'>      quickly vanished on the appearance of Maximin, who declared</a>
<a id='line_185'>      himself the friend and advocate of the military order, and was</a>
<a id='line_186'>      unanimously acknowledged emperor of the Romans by the applauding</a>
<a id='line_187'>      legions. The son of Mamæa, betrayed and deserted, withdrew into</a>
<a id='line_188'>      his tent, desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from</a>
<a id='line_189'>      the insults of the multitude. He was soon followed by a tribune</a>
<a id='line_190'>      and some centurions, the ministers of death; but instead of</a>
<a id='line_191'>      receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke, his</a>
<a id='line_192'>      unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his</a>
<a id='line_193'>      life, and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity</a>
<a id='line_194'>      which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire. His mother,</a>
<a id='line_195'>      Mamæa, whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the cause of</a>
<a id='line_196'>      his ruin, perished with her son. The most faithful of his friends</a>
<a id='line_197'>      were sacrificed to the first fury of the soldiers. Others were</a>
<a id='line_198'>      reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper; and</a>
<a id='line_199'>      those who experienced the mildest treatment, were stripped of</a>
<a id='line_200'>      their employments, and ignominiously driven from the court and</a>
<a id='line_201'>      army. 6</a>

<a id='line_203'>      5 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 135. I have softened some of the</a>
<a id='line_204'>      most improbable circumstances of this wretched biographer. From</a>
<a id='line_205'>      his ill-worded narration, it should seem that the prince’s</a>
<a id='line_206'>      buffoon having accidentally entered the tent, and awakened the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      slumbering monarch, the fear of punishment urged him to persuade</a>
<a id='line_208'>      the disaffected soldiers to commit the murder.]</a>

<a id='line_212'>      The former tyrants, Caligula and Nero, Commodus, and Caracalla,</a>
<a id='line_213'>      were all dissolute and unexperienced youths, 7 educated in the</a>
<a id='line_214'>      purple, and corrupted by the pride of empire, the luxury of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_215'>      and the perfidious voice of flattery. The cruelty of Maximin was</a>
<a id='line_216'>      derived from a different source, the fear of contempt. Though he</a>
<a id='line_217'>      depended on the attachment of the soldiers, who loved him for</a>
<a id='line_218'>      virtues like their own, he was conscious that his mean and</a>
<a id='line_219'>      barbarian origin, his savage appearance, and his total ignorance</a>
<a id='line_220'>      of the arts and institutions of civil life, 8 formed a very</a>
<a id='line_221'>      unfavorable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy</a>
<a id='line_222'>      Alexander. He remembered, that, in his humbler fortune, he had</a>
<a id='line_223'>      often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_224'>      had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves. He</a>
<a id='line_225'>      recollected too the friendship of a few who had relieved his</a>
<a id='line_226'>      poverty, and assisted his rising hopes. But those who had</a>
<a id='line_227'>      spurned, and those who had protected, the Thracian, were guilty</a>
<a id='line_228'>      of the same crime, the knowledge of his original obscurity. For</a>
<a id='line_229'>      this crime many were put to death; and by the execution of</a>
<a id='line_230'>      several of his benefactors, Maximin published, in characters of</a>
<a id='line_231'>      blood, the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude. 9</a>

<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>      The dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every</a>
<a id='line_247'>      suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most</a>
<a id='line_248'>      distinguished by their birth or merit. Whenever he was alarmed</a>
<a id='line_249'>      with the sound of treason, his cruelty was unbounded and</a>
<a id='line_250'>      unrelenting. A conspiracy against his life was either discovered</a>

<a id='line_252'>      principal author of it. Without a witness, without a trial, and</a>
<a id='line_253'>      without an opportunity of defence, Magnus, with four thousand of</a>
<a id='line_254'>      his supposed accomplices, was put to death. Italy and the whole</a>

<a id='line_359'>      The family of Gordianus was one of the most illustrious of the</a>
<a id='line_360'>      Roman senate. On the father’s side he was descended from the</a>
<a id='line_361'>      Gracchi; on his mother’s, from the emperor Trajan. A great estate</a>
<a id='line_362'>      enabled him to support the dignity of his birth, and in the</a>
<a id='line_363'>      enjoyment of it, he displayed an elegant taste and beneficent</a>
<a id='line_364'>      disposition. The palace in Rome, formerly inhabited by the great</a>
<a id='line_365'>      Pompey, had been, during several generations, in the possession</a>
<a id='line_366'>      of Gordian’s family. 15 It was distinguished by ancient trophies</a>
<a id='line_367'>      of naval victories, and decorated with the works of modern</a>
<a id='line_368'>      painting. His villa on the road to Præneste was celebrated for</a>
<a id='line_369'>      baths of singular beauty and extent, for three stately rooms of a</a>
<a id='line_370'>      hundred feet in length, and for a magnificent portico, supported</a>

<a id='line_378'>      and extended, during his consulship, to the principal cities of</a>
<a id='line_379'>      Italy. He was twice elevated to the last-mentioned dignity, by</a>
<a id='line_380'>      Caracalla and by Alexander; for he possessed the uncommon talent</a>
<a id='line_381'>      of acquiring the esteem of virtuous princes, without alarming the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      jealousy of tyrants. His long life was innocently spent in the</a>
<a id='line_383'>      study of letters and the peaceful honors of Rome; and, till he</a>
<a id='line_384'>      was named proconsul of Africa by the voice of the senate and the</a>
<a id='line_385'>      approbation of Alexander, 18 he appears prudently to have</a>
<a id='line_386'>      declined the command of armies and the government of provinces.</a>
<a id='line_387'>      181 As long as that emperor lived, Africa was happy under the</a>
<a id='line_388'>      administration of his worthy representative: after the barbarous</a>
<a id='line_389'>      Maximin had usurped the throne, Gordianus alleviated the miseries</a>
<a id='line_390'>      which he was unable to prevent. When he reluctantly accepted the</a>
<a id='line_391'>      purple, he was above fourscore years old; a last and valuable</a>
<a id='line_392'>      remains of the happy age of the Antonines, whose virtues he</a>
<a id='line_393'>      revived in his own conduct, and celebrated in an elegant poem of</a>

<a id='line_395'>      accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant, was likewise</a>
<a id='line_396'>      declared emperor. His manners were less pure, but his character</a>
<a id='line_397'>      was equally amiable with that of his father. Twenty-two</a>
<a id='line_398'>      acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand</a>

<a id='line_718'>      obtained by arms. The strength of the legions had been assembled</a>

<a id='line_722'>      numbers, by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian</a>
<a id='line_723'>      youth. The life of Maximin had been spent in war, and the candid</a>
<a id='line_724'>      severity of history cannot refuse him the valor of a soldier, or</a>
<a id='line_725'>      even the abilities of an experienced general. 31 It might</a>
<a id='line_726'>      naturally be expected, that a prince of such a character, instead</a>
<a id='line_727'>      of suffering the rebellion to gain stability by delay, should</a>
<a id='line_728'>      immediately have marched from the banks of the Danube to those of</a>
<a id='line_729'>      the Tyber, and that his victorious army, instigated by contempt</a>
<a id='line_730'>      for the senate, and eager to gather the spoils of Italy, should</a>
<a id='line_731'>      have burned with impatience to finish the easy and lucrative</a>

<a id='line_773'>      enemy of Rome. Five days after he had heard of this revolt,</a>
<a id='line_774'>      Maximin sets out from Sirmium on his march to Italy. These events</a>

<a id='line_777'>      Mauritania. The senate, in its alarm, names as emperors Balbus</a>
<a id='line_778'>      and Maximus Pupianus, and intrusts the latter with the war</a>
<a id='line_779'>      against Maximin. Maximin is stopped on his road near Aquileia, by</a>

<a id='line_1000'>      a lively sense of gratitude and obedience. 41 But nothing could</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      reconcile the haughty spirit of the Prætorians. They attended the</a>

<a id='line_1270'>      memory? How could he order his public execution, and yet, in his</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      letters to the senate, exculpate himself from the guilt of his</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      death? Philip, though an ambitious usurper, was by no means a mad</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      tyrant. Some chronological difficulties have likewise been</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      discovered by the nice eyes of Tillemont and Muratori, in this</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      supposed association of Philip to the empire. * Note: Wenck</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      endeavors to reconcile these discrepancies. He supposes that</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      Gordian was led away, and died a natural death in prison. This is</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      directly contrary to the statement of Capitolinus and of Zosimus,</a>

<a id='line_1289'>      On his return from the East to Rome, Philip, desirous of</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      obliterating the memory of his crimes, and of captivating the</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      affections of the people, solemnized the secular games with</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      infinite pomp and magnificence. Since their institution or</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      revival by Augustus, 56 they had been celebrated by Claudius, by</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      Domitian, and by Severus, and were now renewed the fifth time, on</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      the accomplishment of the full period of a thousand years from</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      the foundation of Rome. Every circumstance of the secular games</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      was skillfully adapted to inspire the superstitious mind with</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      deep and solemn reverence. The long interval between them 57</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      exceeded the term of human life; and as none of the spectators</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      had already seen them, none could flatter themselves with the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      expectation of beholding them a second time. The mystic</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      sacrifices were performed, during three nights, on the banks of</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      the Tyber; and the Campus Martius resounded with music and</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      dances, and was illuminated with innumerable lamps and torches.</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      Slaves and strangers were excluded from any participation in</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      these national ceremonies. A chorus of twenty-seven youths, and</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      as many virgins, of noble families, and whose parents were both</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      alive, implored the propitious gods in favor of the present, and</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      for the hope of the rising generation; requesting, in religious</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      hymns, that according to the faith of their ancient oracles, they</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      would still maintain the virtue, the felicity, and the empire of</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      the Roman people. The magnificence of Philip’s shows and</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      entertainments dazzled the eyes of the multitude. The devout were</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      employed in the rites of superstition, whilst the reflecting few</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      revolved in their anxious minds the past history and the future</a>

<a id='line_1321'>      popish jubilees, the copy of the secular games, were invented by</a>

<a id='line_1335'>      centuries had already elapsed. 59 During the four first ages, the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      Romans, in the laborious school of poverty, had acquired the</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      virtues of war and government: by the vigorous exertion of those</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      virtues, and by the assistance of fortune, they had obtained, in</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      the course of the three succeeding centuries, an absolute empire</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      over many countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The last three</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      hundred years had been consumed in apparent prosperity and</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      internal decline. The nation of soldiers, magistrates, and</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      legislators, who composed the thirty-five tribes of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      people, were dissolved into the common mass of mankind, and</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      confounded with the millions of servile provincials, who had</a>

<a id='line_1347'>      mercenary army, levied among the subjects and barbarians of the</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      frontier, was the only order of men who preserved and abused</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      their independence. By their tumultuary election, a Syrian, a</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      Goth, or an Arab, was exalted to the throne of Rome, and invested</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      with despotic power over the conquests and over the country of</a>

<a id='line_1365'>      been. The form was still the same, but the animating health and</a>
