<a id='line_218'>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</a>
<a id='line_219'>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</a>

<a id='line_222'>Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered</a>
<a id='line_223'>With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,</a>
<a id='line_224'>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,</a>
<a id='line_225'>Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</a>
<a id='line_226'>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.</a>
<a id='line_227'>Had I been any god of power, I would</a>
<a id='line_228'>Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere</a>

<a id='line_241'>No harm.</a>
<a id='line_242'>I have done nothing but in care of thee,</a>

<a id='line_244'>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</a>
<a id='line_245'>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</a>

<a id='line_249'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_250'>More to know</a>
<a id='line_251'>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</a>

<a id='line_260'>Lie there my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.</a>
<a id='line_261'>The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d</a>
<a id='line_262'>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</a>
<a id='line_263'>I have with such provision in mine art</a>
<a id='line_264'>So safely ordered that there is no soul—</a>

<a id='line_268'>For thou must now know farther.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_271'>You have often</a>
<a id='line_272'>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp’d,</a>

<a id='line_276'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_277'>The hour’s now come,</a>
<a id='line_278'>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;</a>

<a id='line_284'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_285'>Certainly, sir, I can.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_288'>By what? By any other house, or person?</a>
<a id='line_289'>Of anything the image, tell me, that</a>
<a id='line_290'>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_293'>’Tis far off,</a>
<a id='line_294'>And rather like a dream than an assurance</a>
<a id='line_295'>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</a>
<a id='line_296'>Four or five women once that tended me?</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_299'>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</a>
<a id='line_300'>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</a>
<a id='line_301'>In the dark backward and abysm of time?</a>
<a id='line_302'>If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,</a>

<a id='line_305'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_306'>But that I do not.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_309'>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</a>
<a id='line_310'>Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and</a>
<a id='line_311'>A prince of power.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_314'>Sir, are not you my father?</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_317'>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</a>
<a id='line_318'>She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father</a>
<a id='line_319'>Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir</a>
<a id='line_320'>And princess, no worse issued.</a>
<a id='line_321'></a>
<a id='line_322'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_323'>O, the heavens!</a>
<a id='line_324'>What foul play had we that we came from thence?</a>
<a id='line_325'>Or blessed was’t we did?</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_328'>Both, both, my girl.</a>
<a id='line_329'>By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heav’d thence;</a>
<a id='line_330'>But blessedly holp hither.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>

<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_338'>My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio—</a>
<a id='line_339'>I pray thee, mark me, that a brother should</a>
<a id='line_340'>Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself</a>
<a id='line_341'>Of all the world I lov’d, and to him put</a>
<a id='line_342'>The manage of my state; as at that time</a>
<a id='line_343'>Through all the signories it was the first,</a>
<a id='line_344'>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</a>
<a id='line_345'>In dignity, and for the liberal arts,</a>
<a id='line_346'>Without a parallel: those being all my study,</a>
<a id='line_347'>The government I cast upon my brother,</a>
<a id='line_348'>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</a>
<a id='line_349'>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—</a>
<a id='line_350'>Dost thou attend me?</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_353'>Sir, most heedfully.</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_356'>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</a>
<a id='line_357'>How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who</a>
<a id='line_358'>To trash for over-topping, new created</a>
<a id='line_359'>The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em,</a>
<a id='line_360'>Or else new form’d ’em: having both the key</a>
<a id='line_361'>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state</a>
<a id='line_362'>To what tune pleas’d his ear: that now he was</a>
<a id='line_363'>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</a>
<a id='line_364'>And suck’d my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>MIRANDA.</a>
<a id='line_367'>O, good sir! I do.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_370'>I pray thee, mark me.</a>
<a id='line_371'>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</a>
<a id='line_372'>To closeness and the bettering of my mind</a>
<a id='line_373'>With that which, but by being so retir’d,</a>
<a id='line_374'>O’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother</a>
<a id='line_375'>Awak’d an evil nature; and my trust,</a>
<a id='line_376'>Like a good parent, did beget of him</a>
<a id='line_377'>A falsehood in its contrary as great</a>
<a id='line_378'>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</a>
<a id='line_379'>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</a>
<a id='line_380'>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</a>
<a id='line_381'>But what my power might else exact, like one</a>
<a id='line_382'>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</a>
<a id='line_383'>Made such a sinner of his memory,</a>
<a id='line_384'>To credit his own lie, he did believe</a>
<a id='line_385'>He was indeed the Duke; out o’ the substitution,</a>
<a id='line_386'>And executing th’ outward face of royalty,</a>
<a id='line_387'>With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—</a>
<a id='line_388'>Dost thou hear?</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>

<a id='line_1191'>A laughter.</a>
<a id='line_1192'></a>

<a id='line_1201'></a>
<a id='line_1202'>SEBASTIAN.</a>

<a id='line_1216'></a>
<a id='line_1217'>ADRIAN.</a>

<a id='line_1332'>GONZALO.</a>
<a id='line_1333'>[_To Alonso._] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh</a>

<a id='line_1344'>O! widow Dido; ay, widow Dido.</a>
<a id='line_1345'></a>
<a id='line_1346'>GONZALO.</a>
<a id='line_1347'>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in</a>

<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1351'>That sort was well fish’d for.</a>

<a id='line_1360'>My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,</a>
<a id='line_1361'>Who is so far from Italy removed,</a>
<a id='line_1362'>I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</a>
<a id='line_1363'>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</a>
<a id='line_1364'>Hath made his meal on thee?</a>
<a id='line_1365'></a>
<a id='line_1366'>FRANCISCO.</a>
<a id='line_1367'>Sir, he may live:</a>
<a id='line_1368'>I saw him beat the surges under him,</a>
<a id='line_1369'>And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,</a>
<a id='line_1370'>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</a>
<a id='line_1371'>The surge most swoln that met him. His bold head</a>
<a id='line_1372'>’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared</a>
<a id='line_1373'>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</a>
<a id='line_1374'>To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,</a>
<a id='line_1375'>As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt</a>

<a id='line_1382'>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</a>
<a id='line_1383'>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</a>
<a id='line_1384'>But rather lose her to an African;</a>
<a id='line_1385'>Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,</a>

<a id='line_1395'>Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,</a>
<a id='line_1396'>I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</a>
<a id='line_1397'>More widows in them of this business’ making,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>Than we bring men to comfort them.</a>

<a id='line_1557'>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not</a>
<a id='line_1558'>Myself dispos’d to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_1559'></a>
<a id='line_1560'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1561'>Nor I. My spirits are nimble.</a>
<a id='line_1562'>They fell together all, as by consent;</a>
<a id='line_1563'>They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?—No more.</a>
<a id='line_1565'>And yet methinks I see it in thy face,</a>
<a id='line_1566'>What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee; and</a>
<a id='line_1567'>My strong imagination sees a crown</a>
<a id='line_1568'>Dropping upon thy head.</a>
<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1571'>What, art thou waking?</a>
<a id='line_1572'></a>
<a id='line_1573'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1574'>Do you not hear me speak?</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1577'>I do; and surely</a>
<a id='line_1578'>It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st</a>
<a id='line_1579'>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</a>
<a id='line_1580'>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</a>
<a id='line_1581'>With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,</a>
<a id='line_1582'>And yet so fast asleep.</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1585'>Noble Sebastian,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>Thou let’st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink’st</a>
<a id='line_1587'>Whiles thou art waking.</a>
<a id='line_1588'></a>
<a id='line_1589'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1590'>Thou dost snore distinctly:</a>
<a id='line_1591'>There’s meaning in thy snores.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1594'>I am more serious than my custom; you</a>
<a id='line_1595'>Must be so too, if heed me; which to do</a>
<a id='line_1596'>Trebles thee o’er.</a>
<a id='line_1597'></a>
<a id='line_1598'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1599'>Well, I am standing water.</a>
<a id='line_1600'></a>
<a id='line_1601'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1602'>I’ll teach you how to flow.</a>
<a id='line_1603'></a>
<a id='line_1604'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1605'>Do so: to ebb,</a>
<a id='line_1606'>Hereditary sloth instructs me.</a>
<a id='line_1607'></a>
<a id='line_1608'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1609'>O,</a>
<a id='line_1610'>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</a>
<a id='line_1611'>Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,</a>
<a id='line_1612'>You more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,</a>
<a id='line_1613'>Most often, do so near the bottom run</a>
<a id='line_1614'>By their own fear or sloth.</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1617'>Prithee, say on:</a>
<a id='line_1618'>The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim</a>
<a id='line_1619'>A matter from thee, and a birth, indeed</a>
<a id='line_1620'>Which throes thee much to yield.</a>
<a id='line_1621'></a>
<a id='line_1622'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>Thus, sir:</a>
<a id='line_1624'>Although this lord of weak remembrance, this</a>
<a id='line_1625'>Who shall be of as little memory</a>
<a id='line_1626'>When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded,—</a>
<a id='line_1627'>For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only</a>
<a id='line_1628'>Professes to persuade,—the King his son’s alive,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d</a>
<a id='line_1630'>As he that sleeps here swims.</a>
<a id='line_1631'></a>
<a id='line_1632'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1633'>I have no hope</a>
<a id='line_1634'>That he’s undrown’d.</a>
<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1637'>O, out of that “no hope”</a>
<a id='line_1638'>What great hope have you! No hope that way is</a>
<a id='line_1639'>Another way so high a hope, that even</a>
<a id='line_1640'>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>But doubts discovery there. Will you grant with me</a>
<a id='line_1642'>That Ferdinand is drown’d?</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1645'>He’s gone.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1648'>Then tell me,</a>
<a id='line_1649'>Who’s the next heir of Naples?</a>
<a id='line_1650'></a>
<a id='line_1651'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1652'>Claribel.</a>
<a id='line_1653'></a>
<a id='line_1654'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1655'>She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells</a>
<a id='line_1656'>Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples</a>
<a id='line_1657'>Can have no note, unless the sun were post—</a>
<a id='line_1658'>The Man i’ th’ Moon’s too slow—till newborn chins</a>
<a id='line_1659'>Be rough and razorable; she that from whom</a>
<a id='line_1660'>We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>And by that destiny, to perform an act</a>
<a id='line_1662'>Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come</a>
<a id='line_1663'>In yours and my discharge.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1666'>What stuff is this! How say you?</a>
<a id='line_1667'>’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis;</a>
<a id='line_1668'>So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions</a>
<a id='line_1669'>There is some space.</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1672'>A space whose ev’ry cubit</a>
<a id='line_1673'>Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel</a>
<a id='line_1674'>Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,</a>
<a id='line_1675'>And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death</a>
<a id='line_1676'>That now hath seiz’d them; why, they were no worse</a>
<a id='line_1677'>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples</a>
<a id='line_1678'>As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate</a>
<a id='line_1679'>As amply and unnecessarily</a>
<a id='line_1680'>As this Gonzalo. I myself could make</a>
<a id='line_1681'>A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore</a>
<a id='line_1682'>The mind that I do! What a sleep were this</a>
<a id='line_1683'>For your advancement! Do you understand me?</a>
<a id='line_1684'></a>
<a id='line_1685'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1686'>Methinks I do.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1689'>And how does your content</a>
<a id='line_1690'>Tender your own good fortune?</a>
<a id='line_1691'></a>
<a id='line_1692'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1693'>I remember</a>
<a id='line_1694'>You did supplant your brother Prospero.</a>
<a id='line_1695'></a>
<a id='line_1696'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1697'>True.</a>
<a id='line_1698'>And look how well my garments sit upon me;</a>
<a id='line_1699'>Much feater than before; my brother’s servants</a>
<a id='line_1700'>Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1703'>But, for your conscience.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_1706'>Ay, sir; where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,</a>
<a id='line_1707'>’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not</a>
<a id='line_1708'>This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences</a>
<a id='line_1709'>That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they</a>
<a id='line_1710'>And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,</a>
<a id='line_1711'>No better than the earth he lies upon,</a>
<a id='line_1712'>If he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;</a>
<a id='line_1713'>Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,</a>
<a id='line_1715'>To the perpetual wink for aye might put</a>
<a id='line_1716'>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who</a>
<a id='line_1717'>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,</a>
<a id='line_1718'>They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.</a>
<a id='line_1719'>They’ll tell the clock to any business that</a>
<a id='line_1720'>We say befits the hour.</a>
<a id='line_1721'></a>
<a id='line_1722'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1723'>Thy case, dear friend,</a>
<a id='line_1724'>Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan,</a>
<a id='line_1725'>I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke</a>
<a id='line_1726'>Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,</a>
<a id='line_1727'>And I the King shall love thee.</a>
<a id='line_1728'></a>

<a id='line_1730'>Draw together,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>And when I rear my hand, do you the like,</a>
<a id='line_1732'>To fall it on Gonzalo.</a>
<a id='line_1733'></a>
<a id='line_1734'>SEBASTIAN.</a>
<a id='line_1735'>O, but one word.</a>

<a id='line_3747'>Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,</a>
<a id='line_3748'>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass</a>
<a id='line_3749'>Was I, to take this drunkard for a god,</a>
<a id='line_3750'>And worship this dull fool!</a>
<a id='line_3751'></a>
<a id='line_3752'>PROSPERO.</a>

<a id='line_3764'>Sir, I invite your Highness and your train</a>
<a id='line_3765'>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</a>
<a id='line_3766'>For this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste</a>
<a id='line_3767'>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it</a>
<a id='line_3768'>Go quick away: the story of my life</a>
<a id='line_3769'>And the particular accidents gone by</a>
<a id='line_3770'>Since I came to this isle: and in the morn</a>
<a id='line_3771'>I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</a>
<a id='line_3773'>Of these our dear-belov’d solemnized;</a>
<a id='line_3774'>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</a>
<a id='line_3775'>Every third thought shall be my grave.</a>
<a id='line_3776'></a>
<a id='line_3777'>ALONSO.</a>
<a id='line_3778'>I long</a>
<a id='line_3779'>To hear the story of your life, which must</a>

<a id='line_3781'></a>
<a id='line_3782'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_3783'>I’ll deliver all;</a>
<a id='line_3784'>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,</a>
<a id='line_3785'>And sail so expeditious that shall catch</a>
<a id='line_3786'>Your royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ariel._] My Ariel,</a>
<a id='line_3787'>chick,</a>
<a id='line_3788'>That is thy charge: then to the elements</a>
<a id='line_3789'>Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.</a>

<a id='line_3793'>EPILOGUE</a>
<a id='line_3794'></a>
<a id='line_3795'>PROSPERO.</a>
<a id='line_3796'>Now my charms are all o’erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_3797'>And what strength I have’s mine own,</a>
<a id='line_3798'>Which is most faint. Now ’tis true,</a>
<a id='line_3799'>I must be here confin’d by you,</a>
<a id='line_3800'>Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</a>
<a id='line_3801'>Since I have my dukedom got,</a>
<a id='line_3802'>And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell</a>
<a id='line_3803'>In this bare island by your spell,</a>
<a id='line_3804'>But release me from my bands</a>
<a id='line_3805'>With the help of your good hands.</a>
<a id='line_3806'>Gentle breath of yours my sails</a>
<a id='line_3807'>Must fill, or else my project fails,</a>
<a id='line_3808'>Which was to please. Now I want</a>
<a id='line_3809'>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;</a>
<a id='line_3810'>And my ending is despair,</a>
<a id='line_3811'>Unless I be reliev’d by prayer,</a>
<a id='line_3812'>Which pierces so that it assaults</a>
<a id='line_3813'>Mercy itself, and frees all faults.</a>
<a id='line_3814'>    As you from crimes would pardon’d be,</a>
<a id='line_3815'>    Let your indulgence set me free.</a>
