                    <a id='line_0'>The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of</a>
<a id='line_4'>God, and Sosthenes our brother, 1:2 Unto the church of God which is at</a>
<a id='line_5'>Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be</a>
<a id='line_6'>saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus</a>
<a id='line_7'>Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: 1:3 Grace be unto you, and</a>
<a id='line_8'>peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which</a>
<a id='line_11'>is given you by Jesus Christ; 1:5 That in every thing ye are enriched</a>
<a id='line_12'>by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; 1:6 Even as the</a>
<a id='line_13'>testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 1:7 So that ye come behind</a>
<a id='line_14'>in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: 1:8 Who</a>
<a id='line_15'>shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the</a>
<a id='line_16'>day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his</a>
<a id='line_19'>Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_22'>Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no</a>
<a id='line_23'>divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the</a>
<a id='line_24'>same mind and in the same judgment.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them</a>
<a id='line_27'>which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I</a>
<a id='line_30'>of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye</a>
<a id='line_33'>baptized in the name of Paul?  1:14 I thank God that I baptized none</a>
<a id='line_34'>of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 1:15 Lest any should say that I had</a>
<a id='line_35'>baptized in mine own name.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know</a>
<a id='line_38'>not whether I baptized any other.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not</a>
<a id='line_41'>with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none</a>
<a id='line_42'>effect.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish</a>
<a id='line_45'>foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and</a>
<a id='line_48'>will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of</a>
<a id='line_51'>this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  1:21</a>
<a id='line_52'>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,</a>
<a id='line_53'>it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that</a>
<a id='line_54'>believe.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</a>
<a id='line_57'>1:23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,</a>
<a id='line_58'>and unto the Greeks foolishness; 1:24 But unto them which are called,</a>
<a id='line_59'>both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the</a>
<a id='line_62'>weakness of God is stronger than men.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men</a>
<a id='line_65'>after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 1:27 But</a>
<a id='line_66'>God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;</a>
<a id='line_67'>and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the</a>
<a id='line_68'>things which are mighty; 1:28 And base things of the world, and things</a>
<a id='line_69'>which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to</a>
<a id='line_70'>bring to nought things that are: 1:29 That no flesh should glory in</a>
<a id='line_71'>his presence.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us</a>
<a id='line_74'>wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 1:31</a>
<a id='line_75'>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in</a>
<a id='line_76'>the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>2:1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of</a>
<a id='line_79'>speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>2:2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus</a>
<a id='line_82'>Christ, and him crucified.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much</a>
<a id='line_85'>trembling.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of</a>
<a id='line_88'>man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 2:5</a>
<a id='line_89'>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the</a>
<a id='line_90'>power of God.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the</a>
<a id='line_93'>wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to</a>
<a id='line_94'>nought: 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the</a>
<a id='line_95'>hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 2:8</a>
<a id='line_96'>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it,</a>
<a id='line_97'>they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither</a>
<a id='line_100'>have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared</a>
<a id='line_101'>for them that love him.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit</a>
<a id='line_104'>searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man</a>
<a id='line_107'>which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the</a>
<a id='line_108'>Spirit of God.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit</a>
<a id='line_111'>which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given</a>
<a id='line_112'>to us of God.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom</a>
<a id='line_115'>teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual</a>
<a id='line_116'>things with spiritual.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of</a>
<a id='line_119'>God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,</a>
<a id='line_120'>because they are spiritually discerned.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is</a>
<a id='line_123'>judged of no man.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>2:16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct</a>
<a id='line_126'>him?  But we have the mind of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but</a>
<a id='line_129'>as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were</a>
<a id='line_132'>not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and</a>
<a id='line_135'>strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?  3:4 For</a>
<a id='line_136'>while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye</a>
<a id='line_137'>not carnal?  3:5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers</a>
<a id='line_138'>by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?  3:6 I have</a>
<a id='line_139'>planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>3:7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that</a>
<a id='line_142'>watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>3:8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man</a>
<a id='line_145'>shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>3:9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye</a>
<a id='line_148'>are God’s building.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>3:10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise</a>
<a id='line_151'>masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth</a>
<a id='line_152'>thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is</a>
<a id='line_155'>Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>3:12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious</a>
<a id='line_158'>stones, wood, hay, stubble; 3:13 Every man’s work shall be made</a>
<a id='line_159'>manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed</a>
<a id='line_160'>by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>3:14 If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall</a>
<a id='line_163'>receive a reward.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>3:15 If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he</a>
<a id='line_166'>himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of</a>
<a id='line_169'>God dwelleth in you?  3:17 If any man defile the temple of God, him</a>
<a id='line_170'>shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>3:18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be</a>
<a id='line_173'>wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is</a>
<a id='line_176'>written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>3:20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they</a>
<a id='line_179'>are vain.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</a>
<a id='line_182'>3:22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or</a>
<a id='line_183'>death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 3:23 And</a>
<a id='line_184'>ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and</a>
<a id='line_187'>stewards of the mysteries of God.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>4:2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of</a>
<a id='line_192'>you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>4:4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but</a>
<a id='line_195'>he that judgeth me is the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who</a>
<a id='line_198'>both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make</a>
<a id='line_199'>manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have</a>
<a id='line_200'>praise of God.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>4:6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to</a>
<a id='line_203'>myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to</a>
<a id='line_204'>think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed</a>
<a id='line_205'>up for one against another.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>4:7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou</a>
<a id='line_208'>that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost</a>
<a id='line_209'>thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?  4:8 Now ye are full,</a>
<a id='line_210'>now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to</a>
<a id='line_211'>God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>4:9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it</a>
<a id='line_214'>were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world,</a>
<a id='line_215'>and to angels, and to men.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>4:10 We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are</a>
<a id='line_218'>weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>4:11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are</a>
<a id='line_221'>naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 4:12 And</a>
<a id='line_222'>labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being</a>
<a id='line_223'>persecuted, we suffer it: 4:13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made</a>
<a id='line_224'>as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto</a>
<a id='line_225'>this day.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I</a>
<a id='line_228'>warn you.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>4:15 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have</a>
<a id='line_231'>ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through</a>
<a id='line_232'>the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>4:17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved</a>
<a id='line_237'>son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of</a>
<a id='line_238'>my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>4:18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>4:19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,</a>
<a id='line_243'>not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>4:20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>4:21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and</a>
<a id='line_248'>in the spirit of meekness?  5:1 It is reported commonly that there is</a>
<a id='line_249'>fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named</a>
<a id='line_250'>among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>5:2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that</a>
<a id='line_253'>hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>5:3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have</a>
<a id='line_256'>judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so</a>
<a id='line_257'>done this deed, 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are</a>
<a id='line_258'>gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_259'>Christ, 5:5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of</a>
<a id='line_260'>the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven</a>
<a id='line_263'>leaveneth the whole lump?  5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven,</a>
<a id='line_264'>that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our</a>
<a id='line_265'>passover is sacrificed for us: 5:8 Therefore let us keep the feast,</a>
<a id='line_266'>not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness;</a>
<a id='line_267'>but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>5:9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</a>
<a id='line_270'>5:10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with</a>
<a id='line_271'>the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye</a>
<a id='line_272'>needs go out of the world.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man</a>
<a id='line_275'>that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater,</a>
<a id='line_276'>or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not</a>
<a id='line_277'>to eat.</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>5:12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not</a>
<a id='line_280'>ye judge them that are within?  5:13 But them that are without God</a>
<a id='line_281'>judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before</a>
<a id='line_284'>the unjust, and not before the saints?  6:2 Do ye not know that the</a>
<a id='line_285'>saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you,</a>
<a id='line_286'>are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  6:3 Know ye not that</a>
<a id='line_287'>we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</a>
<a id='line_288'>6:4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set</a>
<a id='line_289'>them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>6:5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man</a>
<a id='line_292'>among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his</a>
<a id='line_293'>brethren?  6:6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before</a>
<a id='line_294'>the unbelievers.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>6:7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to</a>
<a id='line_297'>law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not</a>
<a id='line_298'>rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  6:8 Nay, ye do wrong, and</a>
<a id='line_299'>defraud, and that your brethren.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_302'>God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor</a>
<a id='line_303'>adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</a>
<a id='line_304'>6:10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor</a>
<a id='line_305'>extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>6:11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are</a>
<a id='line_308'>sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by</a>
<a id='line_309'>the Spirit of our God.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>6:12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient:</a>
<a id='line_312'>all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the</a>
<a id='line_313'>power of any.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>6:13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall</a>
<a id='line_316'>destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for</a>
<a id='line_317'>the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</a>
<a id='line_318'></a>
<a id='line_319'>6:14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us</a>
<a id='line_320'>by his own power.</a>
<a id='line_321'></a>
<a id='line_322'>6:15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I</a>
<a id='line_323'>then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an</a>
<a id='line_324'>harlot? God forbid.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>6:16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one</a>
<a id='line_327'>body?  for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>6:17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body;</a>
<a id='line_332'>but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost</a>
<a id='line_335'>which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  6:20</a>
<a id='line_336'>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body,</a>
<a id='line_337'>and in your spirit, which are God’s.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>7:1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for</a>
<a id='line_340'>a man not to touch a woman.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own</a>
<a id='line_343'>wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</a>
<a id='line_344'></a>
<a id='line_345'>7:3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise</a>
<a id='line_346'>also the wife unto the husband.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>7:4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and</a>
<a id='line_349'>likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the</a>
<a id='line_350'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>7:5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a</a>
<a id='line_353'>time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come</a>
<a id='line_354'>together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>7:6 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>7:7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath</a>
<a id='line_359'>his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>7:8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them</a>
<a id='line_362'>if they abide even as I.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>7:9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to</a>
<a id='line_365'>marry than to burn.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>7:10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not</a>
<a id='line_368'>the wife depart from her husband: 7:11 But and if she depart, let her</a>
<a id='line_369'>remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the</a>
<a id='line_370'>husband put away his wife.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>7:12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife</a>
<a id='line_373'>that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not</a>
<a id='line_374'>put her away.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>7:13 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he</a>
<a id='line_377'>be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the</a>
<a id='line_380'>unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children</a>
<a id='line_381'>unclean; but now are they holy.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a</a>
<a id='line_384'>sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to</a>
<a id='line_385'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>7:16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy</a>
<a id='line_388'>husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy</a>
<a id='line_389'>wife?  7:17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath</a>
<a id='line_390'>called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>7:18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become</a>
<a id='line_393'>uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be</a>
<a id='line_394'>circumcised.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the</a>
<a id='line_397'>keeping of the commandments of God.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>7:20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>7:21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou</a>
<a id='line_402'>mayest be made free, use it rather.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>7:22 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s</a>
<a id='line_405'>freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s</a>
<a id='line_406'>servant.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</a>
<a id='line_409'></a>
<a id='line_410'>7:24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with</a>
<a id='line_411'>God.</a>
<a id='line_412'></a>
<a id='line_413'>7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I</a>
<a id='line_414'>give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be</a>
<a id='line_415'>faithful.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>7:26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I</a>
<a id='line_418'>say, that it is good for a man so to be.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou</a>
<a id='line_421'>loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</a>
<a id='line_422'></a>
<a id='line_423'>7:28 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin</a>
<a id='line_424'>marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in</a>
<a id='line_425'>the flesh: but I spare you.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>7:29 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that</a>
<a id='line_428'>both they that have wives be as though they had none; 7:30 And they</a>
<a id='line_429'>that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though</a>
<a id='line_430'>they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</a>
<a id='line_431'>7:31 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion</a>
<a id='line_432'>of this world passeth away.</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>7:32 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried</a>
<a id='line_435'>careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the</a>
<a id='line_436'>Lord: 7:33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of</a>
<a id='line_437'>the world, how he may please his wife.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>7:34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The</a>
<a id='line_440'>unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be</a>
<a id='line_441'>holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for</a>
<a id='line_442'>the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>7:35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare</a>
<a id='line_445'>upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon</a>
<a id='line_446'>the Lord without distraction.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>7:36 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his</a>
<a id='line_449'>virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let</a>
<a id='line_450'>him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>7:37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no</a>
<a id='line_453'>necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in</a>
<a id='line_454'>his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>7:38 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that</a>
<a id='line_457'>giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>7:39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but</a>
<a id='line_460'>if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she</a>
<a id='line_461'>will; only in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I</a>
<a id='line_464'>think also that I have the Spirit of God.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>8:1 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all</a>
<a id='line_467'>have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing</a>
<a id='line_470'>yet as he ought to know.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>8:3 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>8:4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are</a>
<a id='line_475'>offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in</a>
<a id='line_476'>the world, and that there is none other God but one.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>8:5 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in</a>
<a id='line_479'>earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 8:6 But to us there is</a>
<a id='line_480'>but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and</a>
<a id='line_481'>one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'>8:7 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with</a>
<a id='line_484'>conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto</a>
<a id='line_485'>an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>8:8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we</a>
<a id='line_488'>the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>8:9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a</a>
<a id='line_491'>stumblingblock to them that are weak.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>8:10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the</a>
<a id='line_494'>idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be</a>
<a id='line_495'>emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 8:11 And</a>
<a id='line_496'>through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ</a>
<a id='line_497'>died?  8:12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their</a>
<a id='line_498'>weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>8:13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh</a>
<a id='line_501'>while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</a>
<a id='line_502'></a>
<a id='line_503'>9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ</a>
<a id='line_504'>our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?  9:2 If I be not an apostle</a>
<a id='line_505'>unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine</a>
<a id='line_506'>apostleship are ye in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>9:3 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 9:4 Have we not</a>
<a id='line_509'>power to eat and to drink?  9:5 Have we not power to lead about a</a>
<a id='line_510'>sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the</a>
<a id='line_511'>Lord, and Cephas?  9:6 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to</a>
<a id='line_512'>forbear working?  9:7 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?</a>
<a id='line_513'>who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who</a>
<a id='line_514'>feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?  9:8 Say I</a>
<a id='line_515'>these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?  9:9 For it</a>
<a id='line_516'>is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_517'>ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?  9:10 Or</a>
<a id='line_518'>saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is</a>
<a id='line_519'>written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that</a>
<a id='line_520'>thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>9:11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if</a>
<a id='line_523'>we shall reap your carnal things?  9:12 If others be partakers of this</a>
<a id='line_524'>power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this</a>
<a id='line_525'>power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of</a>
<a id='line_526'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>9:13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of</a>
<a id='line_529'>the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are</a>
<a id='line_530'>partakers with the altar?  9:14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that</a>
<a id='line_531'>they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>9:15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written</a>
<a id='line_534'>these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better</a>
<a id='line_535'>for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</a>
<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for</a>
<a id='line_538'>necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the</a>
<a id='line_539'>gospel!  9:17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but</a>
<a id='line_540'>if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>9:18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I</a>
<a id='line_543'>may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my</a>
<a id='line_544'>power in the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>9:19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant</a>
<a id='line_547'>unto all, that I might gain the more.</a>
<a id='line_548'></a>
<a id='line_549'>9:20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;</a>
<a id='line_550'>to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain</a>
<a id='line_551'>them that are under the law; 9:21 To them that are without law, as</a>
<a id='line_552'>without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to</a>
<a id='line_553'>Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</a>
<a id='line_554'></a>
<a id='line_555'>9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am</a>
<a id='line_556'>made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>9:23 And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker</a>
<a id='line_559'>thereof with you.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>9:24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one</a>
<a id='line_562'>receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>9:25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all</a>
<a id='line_565'>things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an</a>
<a id='line_566'>incorruptible.</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>9:26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one</a>
<a id='line_569'>that beateth the air: 9:27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into</a>
<a id='line_570'>subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I</a>
<a id='line_571'>myself should be a castaway.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how</a>
<a id='line_574'>that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the</a>
<a id='line_575'>sea; 10:2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the</a>
<a id='line_576'>sea; 10:3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 10:4 And did all</a>
<a id='line_577'>drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock</a>
<a id='line_578'>that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</a>
<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>10:5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were</a>
<a id='line_581'>overthrown in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>10:6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not</a>
<a id='line_584'>lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,</a>
<a id='line_587'>The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>10:8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and</a>
<a id='line_590'>fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>10:9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and</a>
<a id='line_593'>were destroyed of serpents.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were</a>
<a id='line_596'>destroyed of the destroyer.</a>
<a id='line_597'></a>
<a id='line_598'>10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they</a>
<a id='line_599'>are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are</a>
<a id='line_600'>come.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>10:12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he</a>
<a id='line_603'>fall.</a>
<a id='line_604'></a>
<a id='line_605'>10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:</a>
<a id='line_606'>but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that</a>
<a id='line_607'>ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,</a>
<a id='line_608'>that ye may be able to bear it.</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>10:14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.</a>
<a id='line_611'></a>
<a id='line_612'>10:15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of</a>
<a id='line_615'>the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion</a>
<a id='line_616'>of the body of Christ?  10:17 For we being many are one bread, and one</a>
<a id='line_617'>body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>10:18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the</a>
<a id='line_620'>sacrifices partakers of the altar?  10:19 What say I then? that the</a>
<a id='line_621'>idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is</a>
<a id='line_622'>any thing?  10:20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_623'>sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not</a>
<a id='line_624'>that ye should have fellowship with devils.</a>

<a id='line_626'>10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye</a>
<a id='line_627'>cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>10:22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</a>
<a id='line_630'>10:23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:</a>
<a id='line_631'>all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>10:24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question</a>
<a id='line_636'>for conscience sake: 10:26 For the earth is the Lord’s, and the</a>
<a id='line_637'>fulness thereof.</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>10:27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be</a>
<a id='line_640'>disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question</a>
<a id='line_641'>for conscience sake.</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>10:28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto</a>
<a id='line_644'>idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake:</a>
<a id='line_645'>for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof: 10:29</a>
<a id='line_646'>Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my</a>
<a id='line_647'>liberty judged of another man’s conscience?  10:30 For if I by grace</a>
<a id='line_648'>be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give</a>
<a id='line_649'>thanks?  10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye</a>
<a id='line_650'>do, do all to the glory of God.</a>
<a id='line_651'></a>
<a id='line_652'>10:32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor</a>
<a id='line_653'>to the church of God: 10:33 Even as I please all men in all things,</a>
<a id='line_654'>not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be</a>
<a id='line_655'>saved.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>11:2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,</a>
<a id='line_660'>and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>11:3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;</a>
<a id='line_663'>and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,</a>
<a id='line_666'>dishonoureth his head.</a>
<a id='line_667'></a>
<a id='line_668'>11:5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head</a>
<a id='line_669'>uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she</a>
<a id='line_670'>were shaven.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>11:6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it</a>
<a id='line_673'>be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</a>
<a id='line_674'></a>
<a id='line_675'>11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is</a>
<a id='line_676'>the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</a>
<a id='line_677'></a>
<a id='line_678'>11:8 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>11:9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the</a>
<a id='line_681'>man.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>11:10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because</a>
<a id='line_684'>of the angels.</a>
<a id='line_685'></a>
<a id='line_686'>11:11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the</a>
<a id='line_687'>woman without the man, in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_688'></a>
<a id='line_689'>11:12 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the</a>
<a id='line_690'>woman; but all things of God.</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God</a>
<a id='line_693'>uncovered?  11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a</a>
<a id='line_694'>man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?  11:15 But if a woman have</a>
<a id='line_695'>long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a</a>
<a id='line_696'>covering.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,</a>
<a id='line_699'>neither the churches of God.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>11:17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye</a>
<a id='line_702'>come together not for the better, but for the worse.</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>11:18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear</a>
<a id='line_705'>that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</a>
<a id='line_706'></a>
<a id='line_707'>11:19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are</a>
<a id='line_708'>approved may be made manifest among you.</a>
<a id='line_709'></a>
<a id='line_710'>11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to</a>
<a id='line_711'>eat the Lord’s supper.</a>
<a id='line_712'></a>
<a id='line_713'>11:21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and</a>
<a id='line_714'>one is hungry, and another is drunken.</a>
<a id='line_715'></a>
<a id='line_716'>11:22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye</a>
<a id='line_717'>the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to</a>
<a id='line_718'>you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto</a>
<a id='line_721'>you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took</a>
<a id='line_722'>bread: 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,</a>
<a id='line_723'>Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in</a>
<a id='line_724'>remembrance of me.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,</a>
<a id='line_727'>saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft</a>
<a id='line_728'>as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do</a>
<a id='line_731'>shew the Lord’s death till he come.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of</a>
<a id='line_734'>the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the</a>
<a id='line_735'>Lord.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,</a>
<a id='line_738'>and drink of that cup.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh</a>
<a id='line_741'>damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.</a>
<a id='line_742'></a>
<a id='line_743'>11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many</a>
<a id='line_744'>sleep.</a>
<a id='line_745'></a>
<a id='line_746'>11:31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we</a>
<a id='line_749'>should not be condemned with the world.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one</a>
<a id='line_752'>for another.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not</a>
<a id='line_755'>together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I</a>
<a id='line_756'>come.</a>
<a id='line_757'></a>
<a id='line_758'>12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you</a>
<a id='line_759'>ignorant.</a>
<a id='line_760'></a>
<a id='line_761'>12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb</a>
<a id='line_762'>idols, even as ye were led.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>12:3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the</a>
<a id='line_765'>Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that</a>
<a id='line_766'>Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>12:5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>12:6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God</a>
<a id='line_773'>which worketh all in all.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to</a>
<a id='line_776'>profit withal.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>12:8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another</a>
<a id='line_779'>the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 12:9 To another faith by the</a>
<a id='line_780'>same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 12:10</a>
<a id='line_781'>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another</a>
<a id='line_782'>discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another</a>
<a id='line_783'>the interpretation of tongues: 12:11 But all these worketh that one</a>
<a id='line_784'>and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'>12:12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the</a>
<a id='line_787'>members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we</a>
<a id='line_790'>be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all</a>
<a id='line_791'>made to drink into one Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>12:15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of</a>
<a id='line_796'>the body; is it therefore not of the body?  12:16 And if the ear shall</a>
<a id='line_797'>say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore</a>
<a id='line_798'>not of the body?  12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the</a>
<a id='line_799'>hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  12:18</a>
<a id='line_800'>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it</a>
<a id='line_801'>hath pleased him.</a>
<a id='line_802'></a>
<a id='line_803'>12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?  12:20 But</a>
<a id='line_804'>now are they many members, yet but one body.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>12:21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:</a>
<a id='line_807'>nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</a>
<a id='line_808'></a>
<a id='line_809'>12:22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more</a>
<a id='line_810'>feeble, are necessary: 12:23 And those members of the body, which we</a>
<a id='line_811'>think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant</a>
<a id='line_812'>honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the</a>
<a id='line_815'>body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which</a>
<a id='line_816'>lacked.</a>
<a id='line_817'></a>
<a id='line_818'>12:25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members</a>
<a id='line_819'>should have the same care one for another.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;</a>
<a id='line_822'>or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>
<a id='line_826'>12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily</a>
<a id='line_827'>prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of</a>
<a id='line_828'>healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all</a>
<a id='line_831'>workers of miracles?  12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all</a>
<a id='line_832'>speak with tongues? do all interpret?  12:31 But covet earnestly the</a>
<a id='line_833'>best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</a>
<a id='line_834'></a>
<a id='line_835'>13:1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have</a>
<a id='line_836'>not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</a>
<a id='line_837'></a>
<a id='line_838'>13:2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all</a>
<a id='line_839'>mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I</a>
<a id='line_840'>could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</a>
<a id='line_841'></a>
<a id='line_842'>13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I</a>
<a id='line_843'>give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me</a>
<a id='line_844'>nothing.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity</a>
<a id='line_847'>vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 13:5 Doth not behave itself</a>
<a id='line_848'>unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no</a>
<a id='line_849'>evil; 13:6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 13:7</a>
<a id='line_850'>Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth</a>
<a id='line_851'>all things.</a>
<a id='line_852'></a>
<a id='line_853'>13:8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they</a>
<a id='line_854'>shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there</a>
<a id='line_855'>be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>13:10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in</a>
<a id='line_860'>part shall be done away.</a>
<a id='line_861'></a>
<a id='line_862'>13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,</a>
<a id='line_863'>I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish</a>
<a id='line_864'>things.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'>13:12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:</a>
<a id='line_867'>now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the</a>
<a id='line_870'>greatest of these is charity.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>14:1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that</a>
<a id='line_873'>ye may prophesy.</a>
<a id='line_874'></a>
<a id='line_875'>14:2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men,</a>
<a id='line_876'>but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he</a>
<a id='line_877'>speaketh mysteries.</a>
<a id='line_878'></a>
<a id='line_879'>14:3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and</a>
<a id='line_880'>exhortation, and comfort.</a>
<a id='line_881'></a>
<a id='line_882'>14:4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he</a>
<a id='line_883'>that prophesieth edifieth the church.</a>
<a id='line_884'></a>
<a id='line_885'>14:5 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye</a>
<a id='line_886'>prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh</a>
<a id='line_887'>with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive</a>
<a id='line_888'>edifying.</a>
<a id='line_889'></a>
<a id='line_890'>14:6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what</a>
<a id='line_891'>shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation,</a>
<a id='line_892'>or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?  14:7 And even</a>
<a id='line_893'>things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they</a>
<a id='line_894'>give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped</a>
<a id='line_895'>or harped?  14:8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall</a>
<a id='line_896'>prepare himself to the battle?  14:9 So likewise ye, except ye utter</a>
<a id='line_897'>by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what</a>
<a id='line_898'>is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>14:10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and</a>
<a id='line_901'>none of them is without signification.</a>
<a id='line_902'></a>
<a id='line_903'>14:11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be</a>
<a id='line_904'>unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a</a>
<a id='line_905'>barbarian unto me.</a>
<a id='line_906'></a>
<a id='line_907'>14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek</a>
<a id='line_908'>that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</a>
<a id='line_909'></a>
<a id='line_910'>14:13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that</a>
<a id='line_911'>he may interpret.</a>
<a id='line_912'></a>
<a id='line_913'>14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my</a>
<a id='line_914'>understanding is unfruitful.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray</a>
<a id='line_917'>with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will</a>
<a id='line_918'>sing with the understanding also.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>14:16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that</a>
<a id='line_921'>occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks,</a>
<a id='line_922'>seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  14:17 For thou verily</a>
<a id='line_923'>givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</a>
<a id='line_924'></a>
<a id='line_925'>14:18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 14:19 Yet</a>
<a id='line_926'>in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding,</a>
<a id='line_927'>that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in</a>
<a id='line_928'>an unknown tongue.</a>
<a id='line_929'></a>
<a id='line_930'>14:20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be</a>
<a id='line_931'>ye children, but in understanding be men.</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>14:21 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other</a>
<a id='line_934'>lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not</a>
<a id='line_935'>hear me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_936'></a>
<a id='line_937'>14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but</a>
<a id='line_938'>to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that</a>
<a id='line_939'>believe not, but for them which believe.</a>
<a id='line_940'></a>
<a id='line_941'>14:23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,</a>
<a id='line_942'>and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are</a>
<a id='line_943'>unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  14:24</a>
<a id='line_944'>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one</a>
<a id='line_945'>unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 14:25 And thus</a>
<a id='line_946'>are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his</a>
<a id='line_947'>face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</a>
<a id='line_948'></a>
<a id='line_949'>14:26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of</a>
<a id='line_950'>you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation,</a>
<a id='line_951'>hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</a>
<a id='line_952'></a>
<a id='line_953'>14:27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at</a>
<a id='line_954'>the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</a>
<a id='line_955'></a>
<a id='line_956'>14:28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the</a>
<a id='line_957'>church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</a>
<a id='line_958'></a>
<a id='line_959'>14:29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</a>
<a id='line_960'></a>
<a id='line_961'>14:30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the</a>
<a id='line_962'>first hold his peace.</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>14:31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all</a>
<a id='line_965'>may be comforted.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_968'></a>
<a id='line_969'>14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all</a>
<a id='line_970'>churches of the saints.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>14:34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not</a>
<a id='line_973'>permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under</a>
<a id='line_974'>obedience as also saith the law.</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>14:35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at</a>
<a id='line_977'>home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</a>
<a id='line_978'></a>
<a id='line_979'>14:36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you</a>
<a id='line_980'>only?  14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual,</a>
<a id='line_981'>let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the</a>
<a id='line_982'>commandments of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>14:38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</a>
<a id='line_985'></a>
<a id='line_986'>14:39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak</a>
<a id='line_987'>with tongues.</a>
<a id='line_988'></a>
<a id='line_989'>14:40 Let all things be done decently and in order.</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I</a>
<a id='line_992'>preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</a>
<a id='line_993'>15:2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached</a>
<a id='line_994'>unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</a>
<a id='line_995'></a>
<a id='line_996'>15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,</a>
<a id='line_997'>how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 15:4</a>
<a id='line_998'>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according</a>
<a id='line_999'>to the scriptures: 15:5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the</a>
<a id='line_1000'>twelve: 15:6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at</a>
<a id='line_1001'>once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are</a>
<a id='line_1002'>fallen asleep.</a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>15:7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</a>
<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>15:8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due</a>
<a id='line_1007'>time.</a>
<a id='line_1008'></a>
<a id='line_1009'>15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called</a>
<a id='line_1010'>an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</a>
<a id='line_1011'></a>
<a id='line_1012'>15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was</a>
<a id='line_1013'>bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than</a>
<a id='line_1014'>they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</a>
<a id='line_1015'></a>
<a id='line_1016'>15:11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye</a>
<a id='line_1017'>believed.</a>
<a id='line_1018'></a>
<a id='line_1019'>15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say</a>
<a id='line_1020'>some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?  15:13 But</a>
<a id='line_1021'>if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</a>
<a id='line_1022'>15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your</a>
<a id='line_1023'>faith is also vain.</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have</a>
<a id='line_1026'>testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if</a>
<a id='line_1027'>so be that the dead rise not.</a>
<a id='line_1028'></a>
<a id='line_1029'>15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 15:17 And</a>
<a id='line_1030'>if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</a>
<a id='line_1031'></a>
<a id='line_1032'>15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</a>
<a id='line_1033'></a>
<a id='line_1034'>15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men</a>
<a id='line_1035'>most miserable.</a>
<a id='line_1036'></a>
<a id='line_1037'>15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the</a>
<a id='line_1038'>firstfruits of them that slept.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection</a>
<a id='line_1041'>of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made</a>
<a id='line_1044'>alive.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;</a>
<a id='line_1047'>afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.</a>
<a id='line_1048'></a>
<a id='line_1049'>15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1050'>to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all</a>
<a id='line_1051'>authority and power.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</a>
<a id='line_1054'></a>
<a id='line_1055'>15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</a>
<a id='line_1056'></a>
<a id='line_1057'>15:27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all</a>
<a id='line_1058'>things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which</a>
<a id='line_1059'>did put all things under him.</a>
<a id='line_1060'></a>
<a id='line_1061'>15:28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the</a>
<a id='line_1062'>Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>that God may be all in all.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>15:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the</a>
<a id='line_1066'>dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  15:30</a>
<a id='line_1067'>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  15:31 I protest by your</a>
<a id='line_1068'>rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.</a>
<a id='line_1069'></a>
<a id='line_1070'>15:32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink;</a>
<a id='line_1072'>for to morrow we die.</a>
<a id='line_1073'></a>
<a id='line_1074'>15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the</a>
<a id='line_1077'>knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>15:35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what</a>
<a id='line_1080'>body do they come?  15:36 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not</a>
<a id='line_1081'>quickened, except it die: 15:37 And that which thou sowest, thou</a>
<a id='line_1082'>sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of</a>
<a id='line_1083'>wheat, or of some other grain: 15:38 But God giveth it a body as it</a>
<a id='line_1084'>hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh</a>
<a id='line_1087'>of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of</a>
<a id='line_1088'>birds.</a>
<a id='line_1089'></a>
<a id='line_1090'>15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the</a>
<a id='line_1091'>glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is</a>
<a id='line_1092'>another.</a>
<a id='line_1093'></a>
<a id='line_1094'>15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,</a>
<a id='line_1095'>and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another</a>
<a id='line_1096'>star in glory.</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in</a>
<a id='line_1099'>corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 15:43 It is sown in</a>
<a id='line_1100'>dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised</a>
<a id='line_1101'>in power: 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual</a>
<a id='line_1102'>body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;</a>
<a id='line_1105'>the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is</a>
<a id='line_1108'>natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the</a>
<a id='line_1111'>Lord from heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>
<a id='line_1113'>15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is</a>
<a id='line_1114'>the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</a>
<a id='line_1115'></a>
<a id='line_1116'>15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear</a>
<a id='line_1117'>the image of the heavenly.</a>
<a id='line_1118'></a>
<a id='line_1119'>15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit</a>
<a id='line_1120'>the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</a>
<a id='line_1121'></a>
<a id='line_1122'>15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we</a>
<a id='line_1123'>shall all be changed, 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be</a>
<a id='line_1125'>raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal</a>
<a id='line_1128'>must put on immortality.</a>
<a id='line_1129'></a>
<a id='line_1130'>15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and</a>
<a id='line_1131'>this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to</a>
<a id='line_1132'>pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</a>
<a id='line_1135'>15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</a>
<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our</a>
<a id='line_1138'>Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,</a>
<a id='line_1141'>always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that</a>
<a id='line_1142'>your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given</a>
<a id='line_1145'>order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</a>
<a id='line_1146'></a>
<a id='line_1147'>16:2 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in</a>
<a id='line_1148'>store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I</a>
<a id='line_1149'>come.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>16:3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1153'></a>
<a id='line_1154'>16:4 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>16:5 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:</a>
<a id='line_1157'>for I do pass through Macedonia.</a>
<a id='line_1158'></a>
<a id='line_1159'>16:6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that</a>
<a id='line_1160'>ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>16:7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a</a>
<a id='line_1163'>while with you, if the Lord permit.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>16:8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_1166'></a>
<a id='line_1167'>16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are</a>
<a id='line_1168'>many adversaries.</a>
<a id='line_1169'></a>
<a id='line_1170'>16:10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear:</a>
<a id='line_1171'>for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>16:11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in</a>
<a id='line_1174'>peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>16:12 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come</a>
<a id='line_1177'>unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at</a>
<a id='line_1178'>this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>16:14 Let all your things be done with charity.</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>16:15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that</a>
<a id='line_1185'>it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted</a>
<a id='line_1186'>themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 16:16 That ye submit</a>
<a id='line_1187'>yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and</a>
<a id='line_1188'>laboureth.</a>
<a id='line_1189'></a>
<a id='line_1190'>16:17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and</a>
<a id='line_1191'>Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</a>
<a id='line_1192'></a>
<a id='line_1193'>16:18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore</a>
<a id='line_1194'>acknowledge ye them that are such.</a>
<a id='line_1195'></a>
<a id='line_1196'>16:19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you</a>
<a id='line_1197'>much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</a>
<a id='line_1198'></a>
<a id='line_1199'>16:20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with</a>
<a id='line_1200'>an holy kiss.</a>
<a id='line_1201'></a>
<a id='line_1202'>16:21 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be</a>
<a id='line_1205'>Anathema Maranatha.</a>
<a id='line_1206'></a>
<a id='line_1207'>16:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</a>
<a id='line_1208'></a>
<a id='line_1209'>16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_1210'></a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'></a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians</a>
<a id='line_1215'></a>
<a id='line_1216'></a>
<a id='line_1217'>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy</a>
<a id='line_1218'>our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the</a>
<a id='line_1219'>saints which are in all Achaia: 1:2 Grace be to you and peace from God</a>
<a id='line_1220'>our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>1:3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the</a>
<a id='line_1223'>Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 1:4 Who comforteth us</a>
<a id='line_1224'>in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are</a>
<a id='line_1225'>in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of</a>
<a id='line_1226'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>1:5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation</a>
<a id='line_1229'>also aboundeth by Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1230'></a>
<a id='line_1231'>1:6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and</a>
<a id='line_1232'>salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings</a>
<a id='line_1233'>which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your</a>
<a id='line_1234'>consolation and salvation.</a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>1:7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers</a>
<a id='line_1237'>of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</a>
<a id='line_1238'></a>
<a id='line_1239'>1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which</a>
<a id='line_1240'>came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above</a>
<a id='line_1241'>strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 1:9 But we had the</a>
<a id='line_1242'>sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>but in God which raiseth the dead: 1:10 Who delivered us from so great</a>
<a id='line_1244'>a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver</a>
<a id='line_1245'>us; 1:11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift</a>
<a id='line_1246'>bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by</a>
<a id='line_1247'>many on our behalf.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that</a>
<a id='line_1250'>in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the</a>
<a id='line_1251'>grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more</a>
<a id='line_1252'>abundantly to you-ward.</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>1:13 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or</a>
<a id='line_1255'>acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 1:14 As</a>
<a id='line_1256'>also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even</a>
<a id='line_1257'>as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>1:15 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that</a>
<a id='line_1260'>ye might have a second benefit; 1:16 And to pass by you into</a>
<a id='line_1261'>Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to</a>
<a id='line_1262'>be brought on my way toward Judaea.</a>
<a id='line_1263'></a>
<a id='line_1264'>1:17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the</a>
<a id='line_1265'>things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with</a>
<a id='line_1266'>me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?  1:18 But as God is true, our</a>
<a id='line_1267'>word toward you was not yea and nay.</a>
<a id='line_1268'></a>
<a id='line_1269'>1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by</a>
<a id='line_1270'>us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in</a>
<a id='line_1271'>him was yea.</a>
<a id='line_1272'></a>
<a id='line_1273'>1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto</a>
<a id='line_1274'>the glory of God by us.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>1:21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed</a>
<a id='line_1277'>us, is God; 1:22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>Spirit in our hearts.</a>
<a id='line_1279'></a>
<a id='line_1280'>1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you</a>
<a id='line_1281'>I came not as yet unto Corinth.</a>
<a id='line_1282'></a>
<a id='line_1283'>1:24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of</a>
<a id='line_1284'>your joy: for by faith ye stand.</a>
<a id='line_1285'></a>
<a id='line_1286'>2:1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to</a>
<a id='line_1287'>you in heaviness.</a>
<a id='line_1288'></a>
<a id='line_1289'>2:2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but</a>
<a id='line_1290'>the same which is made sorry by me?  2:3 And I wrote this same unto</a>
<a id='line_1291'>you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought</a>
<a id='line_1292'>to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of</a>
<a id='line_1293'>you all.</a>
<a id='line_1294'></a>
<a id='line_1295'>2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you</a>
<a id='line_1296'>with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know</a>
<a id='line_1297'>the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1298'></a>
<a id='line_1299'>2:5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:</a>
<a id='line_1300'>that I may not overcharge you all.</a>
<a id='line_1301'></a>
<a id='line_1302'>2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted</a>
<a id='line_1303'>of many.</a>
<a id='line_1304'></a>
<a id='line_1305'>2:7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort</a>
<a id='line_1306'>him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch</a>
<a id='line_1307'>sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_1308'></a>
<a id='line_1309'>2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward</a>
<a id='line_1310'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>2:9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of</a>
<a id='line_1313'>you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</a>
<a id='line_1314'></a>
<a id='line_1315'>2:10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave</a>
<a id='line_1316'>any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the</a>
<a id='line_1317'>person of Christ; 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for</a>
<a id='line_1318'>we are not ignorant of his devices.</a>
<a id='line_1319'></a>
<a id='line_1320'>2:12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and</a>
<a id='line_1321'>a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 2:13 I had no rest in my</a>
<a id='line_1322'>spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of</a>
<a id='line_1323'>them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</a>
<a id='line_1324'></a>
<a id='line_1325'>2:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in</a>
<a id='line_1326'>Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every</a>
<a id='line_1327'>place.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are</a>
<a id='line_1330'>saved, and in them that perish: 2:16 To the one we are the savour of</a>
<a id='line_1331'>death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And</a>
<a id='line_1332'>who is sufficient for these things?  2:17 For we are not as many,</a>
<a id='line_1333'>which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in</a>
<a id='line_1334'>the sight of God speak we in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>3:1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some</a>
<a id='line_1337'>others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation</a>
<a id='line_1338'>from you?  3:2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and</a>
<a id='line_1339'>read of all men: 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the</a>
<a id='line_1340'>epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the</a>
<a id='line_1341'>Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables</a>
<a id='line_1342'>of the heart.</a>
<a id='line_1343'></a>
<a id='line_1344'>3:4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 3:5 Not that we</a>
<a id='line_1345'>are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but</a>
<a id='line_1346'>our sufficiency is of God; 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of</a>
<a id='line_1347'>the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the</a>
<a id='line_1348'>letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>3:7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,</a>
<a id='line_1351'>was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly</a>
<a id='line_1352'>behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory</a>
<a id='line_1353'>was to be done away: 3:8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit</a>
<a id='line_1354'>be rather glorious?  3:9 For if the ministration of condemnation be</a>
<a id='line_1355'>glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in</a>
<a id='line_1356'>glory.</a>
<a id='line_1357'></a>
<a id='line_1358'>3:10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this</a>
<a id='line_1359'>respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</a>
<a id='line_1360'></a>
<a id='line_1361'>3:11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which</a>
<a id='line_1362'>remaineth is glorious.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>3:12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of</a>
<a id='line_1365'>speech: 3:13 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that</a>
<a id='line_1366'>the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that</a>
<a id='line_1367'>which is abolished: 3:14 But their minds were blinded: for until this</a>
<a id='line_1368'>day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old</a>
<a id='line_1369'>testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1370'></a>
<a id='line_1371'>3:15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon</a>
<a id='line_1372'>their heart.</a>
<a id='line_1373'></a>
<a id='line_1374'>3:16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be</a>
<a id='line_1375'>taken away.</a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'>3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>there is liberty.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>3:18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of</a>
<a id='line_1381'>the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as</a>
<a id='line_1382'>by the Spirit of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1383'></a>
<a id='line_1384'>4:1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,</a>
<a id='line_1385'>we faint not; 4:2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;</a>
<a id='line_1387'>but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s</a>
<a id='line_1388'>conscience in the sight of God.</a>
<a id='line_1389'></a>
<a id='line_1390'>4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4 In</a>
<a id='line_1391'>whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which</a>
<a id='line_1392'>believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is</a>
<a id='line_1393'>the image of God, should shine unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and</a>
<a id='line_1396'>ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.</a>
<a id='line_1397'></a>
<a id='line_1398'>4:6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath</a>
<a id='line_1399'>shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory</a>
<a id='line_1400'>of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1401'></a>
<a id='line_1402'>4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency</a>
<a id='line_1403'>of the power may be of God, and not of us.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>4:8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are</a>
<a id='line_1406'>perplexed, but not in despair; 4:9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast</a>
<a id='line_1407'>down, but not destroyed; 4:10 Always bearing about in the body the</a>
<a id='line_1408'>dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made</a>
<a id='line_1409'>manifest in our body.</a>
<a id='line_1410'></a>
<a id='line_1411'>4:11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake,</a>
<a id='line_1412'>that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal</a>
<a id='line_1413'>flesh.</a>
<a id='line_1414'></a>
<a id='line_1415'>4:12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</a>
<a id='line_1416'></a>
<a id='line_1417'>4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I</a>
<a id='line_1418'>believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_1419'>speak; 4:14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise</a>
<a id='line_1420'>up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</a>
<a id='line_1421'></a>
<a id='line_1422'>4:15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might</a>
<a id='line_1423'>through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</a>
<a id='line_1424'></a>
<a id='line_1425'>4:16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,</a>
<a id='line_1426'>yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</a>
<a id='line_1427'></a>
<a id='line_1428'>4:17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for</a>
<a id='line_1429'>us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; 4:18 While we</a>
<a id='line_1430'>look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not</a>
<a id='line_1431'>seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which</a>
<a id='line_1432'>are not seen are eternal.</a>
<a id='line_1433'></a>
<a id='line_1434'>5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were</a>
<a id='line_1435'>dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,</a>
<a id='line_1436'>eternal in the heavens.</a>
<a id='line_1437'></a>
<a id='line_1438'>5:2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with</a>
<a id='line_1439'>our house which is from heaven: 5:3 If so be that being clothed we</a>
<a id='line_1440'>shall not be found naked.</a>
<a id='line_1441'></a>
<a id='line_1442'>5:4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not</a>
<a id='line_1443'>for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might</a>
<a id='line_1444'>be swallowed up of life.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>5:5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who</a>
<a id='line_1447'>also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_1448'></a>
<a id='line_1449'>5:6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at</a>
<a id='line_1450'>home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 5:7 (For we walk by</a>
<a id='line_1451'>faith, not by sight:) 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather</a>
<a id='line_1452'>to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1453'></a>
<a id='line_1454'>5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be</a>
<a id='line_1455'>accepted of him.</a>
<a id='line_1456'></a>
<a id='line_1457'>5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that</a>
<a id='line_1458'>every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that</a>
<a id='line_1459'>he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</a>
<a id='line_1460'></a>
<a id='line_1461'>5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we</a>
<a id='line_1462'>are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your</a>
<a id='line_1463'>consciences.</a>
<a id='line_1464'></a>
<a id='line_1465'>5:12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you</a>
<a id='line_1466'>occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer</a>
<a id='line_1467'>them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>5:13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we</a>
<a id='line_1470'>be sober, it is for your cause.</a>
<a id='line_1471'></a>
<a id='line_1472'>5:14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,</a>
<a id='line_1473'>that if one died for all, then were all dead: 5:15 And that he died</a>
<a id='line_1474'>for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto</a>
<a id='line_1475'>themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</a>
<a id='line_1476'></a>
<a id='line_1477'>5:16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though</a>
<a id='line_1478'>we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him</a>
<a id='line_1479'>no more.</a>
<a id='line_1480'></a>
<a id='line_1481'>5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old</a>
<a id='line_1482'>things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</a>
<a id='line_1483'></a>
<a id='line_1484'>5:18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by</a>
<a id='line_1485'>Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</a>
<a id='line_1486'>5:19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto</a>
<a id='line_1487'>himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed</a>
<a id='line_1488'>unto us the word of reconciliation.</a>
<a id='line_1489'></a>
<a id='line_1490'>5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech</a>
<a id='line_1491'>you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.</a>
<a id='line_1492'></a>
<a id='line_1493'>5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we</a>
<a id='line_1494'>might be made the righteousness of God in him.</a>
<a id='line_1495'></a>
<a id='line_1496'>6:1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye</a>
<a id='line_1497'>receive not the grace of God in vain.</a>
<a id='line_1498'></a>
<a id='line_1499'>6:2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted</a>
<a id='line_1501'>time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)  6:3 Giving no offence in</a>
<a id='line_1502'>any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 6:4 But in all things</a>
<a id='line_1503'>approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in</a>
<a id='line_1504'>afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 6:5 In stripes, in</a>
<a id='line_1505'>imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 6:6</a>
<a id='line_1506'>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy</a>
<a id='line_1507'>Ghost, by love unfeigned, 6:7 By the word of truth, by the power of</a>
<a id='line_1508'>God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</a>
<a id='line_1509'>6:8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as</a>
<a id='line_1510'>deceivers, and yet true; 6:9 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying,</a>
<a id='line_1511'>and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 6:10 As sorrowful,</a>
<a id='line_1512'>yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing,</a>
<a id='line_1513'>and yet possessing all things.</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>6:11 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is</a>
<a id='line_1516'>enlarged.</a>
<a id='line_1517'></a>
<a id='line_1518'>6:12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own</a>
<a id='line_1519'>bowels.</a>
<a id='line_1520'></a>
<a id='line_1521'>6:13 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,)</a>
<a id='line_1522'>be ye also enlarged.</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what</a>
<a id='line_1525'>fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion</a>
<a id='line_1526'>hath light with darkness?  6:15 And what concord hath Christ with</a>
<a id='line_1527'>Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  6:16 And</a>
<a id='line_1528'>what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the</a>
<a id='line_1529'>temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and</a>
<a id='line_1530'>walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</a>
<a id='line_1531'></a>
<a id='line_1532'>6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the</a>
<a id='line_1533'>Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.</a>
<a id='line_1534'></a>
<a id='line_1535'>6:18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and</a>
<a id='line_1536'>daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</a>
<a id='line_1537'></a>
<a id='line_1538'>7:1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse</a>
<a id='line_1539'>ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting</a>
<a id='line_1540'>holiness in the fear of God.</a>
<a id='line_1541'></a>
<a id='line_1542'>7:2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we</a>
<a id='line_1543'>have defrauded no man.</a>
<a id='line_1544'></a>
<a id='line_1545'>7:3 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye</a>
<a id='line_1546'>are in our hearts to die and live with you.</a>
<a id='line_1547'></a>
<a id='line_1548'>7:4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of</a>
<a id='line_1549'>you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our</a>
<a id='line_1550'>tribulation.</a>
<a id='line_1551'></a>
<a id='line_1552'>7:5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but</a>
<a id='line_1553'>we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were</a>
<a id='line_1554'>fears.</a>
<a id='line_1555'></a>
<a id='line_1556'>7:6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,</a>
<a id='line_1557'>comforted us by the coming of Titus; 7:7 And not by his coming only,</a>
<a id='line_1558'>but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told</a>
<a id='line_1559'>us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so</a>
<a id='line_1560'>that I rejoiced the more.</a>
<a id='line_1561'></a>
<a id='line_1562'>7:8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though</a>
<a id='line_1563'>I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you</a>
<a id='line_1564'>sorry, though it were but for a season.</a>
<a id='line_1565'></a>
<a id='line_1566'>7:9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed</a>
<a id='line_1567'>to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye</a>
<a id='line_1568'>might receive damage by us in nothing.</a>
<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be</a>
<a id='line_1571'>repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</a>
<a id='line_1572'></a>
<a id='line_1573'>7:11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly</a>
<a id='line_1574'>sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of</a>
<a id='line_1575'>yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement</a>
<a id='line_1576'>desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have</a>
<a id='line_1577'>approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</a>
<a id='line_1578'></a>
<a id='line_1579'>7:12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause</a>
<a id='line_1580'>that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but</a>
<a id='line_1581'>that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1582'></a>
<a id='line_1583'>7:13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly</a>
<a id='line_1584'>the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was</a>
<a id='line_1585'>refreshed by you all.</a>
<a id='line_1586'></a>
<a id='line_1587'>7:14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;</a>
<a id='line_1588'>but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</a>
<a id='line_1590'></a>
<a id='line_1591'>7:15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he</a>
<a id='line_1592'>remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye</a>
<a id='line_1593'>received him.</a>
<a id='line_1594'></a>
<a id='line_1595'>7:16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</a>
<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>8:1 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed</a>
<a id='line_1598'>on the churches of Macedonia; 8:2 How that in a great trial of</a>
<a id='line_1599'>affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded</a>
<a id='line_1600'>unto the riches of their liberality.</a>
<a id='line_1601'></a>
<a id='line_1602'>8:3 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power</a>
<a id='line_1603'>they were willing of themselves; 8:4 Praying us with much intreaty</a>
<a id='line_1604'>that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>ministering to the saints.</a>
<a id='line_1606'></a>
<a id='line_1607'>8:5 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own</a>
<a id='line_1608'>selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</a>
<a id='line_1609'></a>
<a id='line_1610'>8:6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would</a>
<a id='line_1611'>also finish in you the same grace also.</a>
<a id='line_1612'></a>
<a id='line_1613'>8:7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,</a>
<a id='line_1614'>and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that</a>
<a id='line_1615'>ye abound in this grace also.</a>
<a id='line_1616'></a>
<a id='line_1617'>8:8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of</a>
<a id='line_1618'>others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</a>
<a id='line_1619'></a>
<a id='line_1620'>8:9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he</a>
<a id='line_1621'>was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his</a>
<a id='line_1622'>poverty might be rich.</a>
<a id='line_1623'></a>
<a id='line_1624'>8:10 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who</a>
<a id='line_1625'>have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</a>
<a id='line_1626'></a>
<a id='line_1627'>8:11 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a</a>
<a id='line_1628'>readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that</a>
<a id='line_1629'>which ye have.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>8:12 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to</a>
<a id='line_1632'>that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</a>
<a id='line_1633'></a>
<a id='line_1634'>8:13 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But</a>
<a id='line_1635'>by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply</a>
<a id='line_1636'>for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your</a>
<a id='line_1637'>want: that there may be equality: 8:15 As it is written, He that had</a>
<a id='line_1638'>gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no</a>
<a id='line_1639'>lack.</a>
<a id='line_1640'></a>
<a id='line_1641'>8:16 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the</a>
<a id='line_1642'>heart of Titus for you.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>8:17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,</a>
<a id='line_1645'>of his own accord he went unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>8:18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the</a>
<a id='line_1648'>gospel throughout all the churches; 8:19 And not that only, but who</a>
<a id='line_1649'>was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace,</a>
<a id='line_1650'>which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and</a>
<a id='line_1651'>declaration of your ready mind: 8:20 Avoiding this, that no man should</a>
<a id='line_1652'>blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 8:21 Providing</a>
<a id='line_1653'>for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the</a>
<a id='line_1654'>sight of men.</a>
<a id='line_1655'></a>
<a id='line_1656'>8:22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes</a>
<a id='line_1657'>proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>great confidence which I have in you.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>8:23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and</a>
<a id='line_1661'>fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are</a>
<a id='line_1662'>the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1663'></a>
<a id='line_1664'>8:24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of</a>
<a id='line_1665'>your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</a>
<a id='line_1666'></a>
<a id='line_1667'>9:1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous</a>
<a id='line_1668'>for me to write to you: 9:2 For I know the forwardness of your mind,</a>
<a id='line_1669'>for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a</a>
<a id='line_1670'>year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</a>
<a id='line_1671'></a>
<a id='line_1672'>9:3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be</a>
<a id='line_1673'>in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 9:4 Lest</a>
<a id='line_1674'>haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we</a>
<a id='line_1675'>(that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident</a>
<a id='line_1676'>boasting.</a>
<a id='line_1677'></a>
<a id='line_1678'>9:5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they</a>
<a id='line_1679'>would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof</a>
<a id='line_1680'>ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of</a>
<a id='line_1681'>bounty, and not as of covetousness.</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also</a>
<a id='line_1684'>sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also</a>
<a id='line_1685'>bountifully.</a>
<a id='line_1686'></a>
<a id='line_1687'>9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;</a>
<a id='line_1688'>not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</a>
<a id='line_1689'></a>
<a id='line_1690'>9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,</a>
<a id='line_1691'>always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good</a>
<a id='line_1692'>work: 9:9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given</a>
<a id='line_1693'>to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.</a>
<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>9:10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for</a>
<a id='line_1696'>your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of</a>
<a id='line_1697'>your righteousness;) 9:11 Being enriched in every thing to all</a>
<a id='line_1698'>bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>9:12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the</a>
<a id='line_1701'>want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto</a>
<a id='line_1702'>God; 9:13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify</a>
<a id='line_1703'>God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for</a>
<a id='line_1704'>your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men; 9:14 And by</a>
<a id='line_1705'>their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of</a>
<a id='line_1706'>God in you.</a>
<a id='line_1707'></a>
<a id='line_1708'>9:15 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</a>
<a id='line_1709'></a>
<a id='line_1710'>10:1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of</a>
<a id='line_1711'>Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold</a>
<a id='line_1712'>toward you: 10:2 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am</a>
<a id='line_1713'>present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against</a>
<a id='line_1714'>some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_1715'></a>
<a id='line_1716'>10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</a>
<a id='line_1717'>10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty</a>
<a id='line_1718'>through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 10:5 Casting down</a>
<a id='line_1719'>imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the</a>
<a id='line_1720'>knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the</a>
<a id='line_1721'>obedience of Christ; 10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all</a>
<a id='line_1722'>disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>10:7 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man</a>
<a id='line_1725'>trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this</a>
<a id='line_1726'>again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>10:8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which</a>
<a id='line_1729'>the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction,</a>
<a id='line_1730'>I should not be ashamed: 10:9 That I may not seem as if I would</a>
<a id='line_1731'>terrify you by letters.</a>
<a id='line_1732'></a>
<a id='line_1733'>10:10 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his</a>
<a id='line_1734'>bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</a>
<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>10:11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by</a>
<a id='line_1737'>letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are</a>
<a id='line_1738'>present.</a>
<a id='line_1739'></a>
<a id='line_1740'>10:12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare</a>
<a id='line_1741'>ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring</a>
<a id='line_1742'>themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>are not wise.</a>
<a id='line_1744'></a>
<a id='line_1745'>10:13 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but</a>
<a id='line_1746'>according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us,</a>
<a id='line_1747'>a measure to reach even unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1748'></a>
<a id='line_1749'>10:14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we</a>
<a id='line_1750'>reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in</a>
<a id='line_1751'>preaching the gospel of Christ: 10:15 Not boasting of things without</a>
<a id='line_1752'>our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when</a>
<a id='line_1753'>your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to</a>
<a id='line_1754'>our rule abundantly, 10:16 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond</a>
<a id='line_1755'>you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to</a>
<a id='line_1756'>our hand.</a>
<a id='line_1757'></a>
<a id='line_1758'>10:17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1759'></a>
<a id='line_1760'>10:18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the</a>
<a id='line_1761'>Lord commendeth.</a>
<a id='line_1762'></a>
<a id='line_1763'>11:1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and</a>
<a id='line_1764'>indeed bear with me.</a>
<a id='line_1765'></a>
<a id='line_1766'>11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have</a>
<a id='line_1767'>espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin</a>
<a id='line_1768'>to Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1769'></a>
<a id='line_1770'>11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve</a>
<a id='line_1771'>through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the</a>
<a id='line_1772'>simplicity that is in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1773'></a>
<a id='line_1774'>11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not</a>
<a id='line_1775'>preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received,</a>
<a id='line_1776'>or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with</a>
<a id='line_1777'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1778'></a>
<a id='line_1779'>11:5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>11:6 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have</a>
<a id='line_1782'>been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</a>
<a id='line_1783'></a>
<a id='line_1784'>11:7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be</a>
<a id='line_1785'>exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</a>
<a id='line_1786'>11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>11:9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to</a>
<a id='line_1789'>no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from</a>
<a id='line_1790'>Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being</a>
<a id='line_1791'>burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.</a>
<a id='line_1792'></a>
<a id='line_1793'>11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this</a>
<a id='line_1794'>boasting in the regions of Achaia.</a>
<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>11:11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</a>
<a id='line_1797'></a>
<a id='line_1798'>11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from</a>
<a id='line_1799'>them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found</a>
<a id='line_1800'>even as we.</a>
<a id='line_1801'></a>
<a id='line_1802'>11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming</a>
<a id='line_1803'>themselves into the apostles of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1804'></a>
<a id='line_1805'>11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of</a>
<a id='line_1806'>light.</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>11:15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be</a>
<a id='line_1809'>transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be</a>
<a id='line_1810'>according to their works.</a>
<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>11:16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a</a>
<a id='line_1813'>fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</a>
<a id='line_1814'></a>
<a id='line_1815'>11:17 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it</a>
<a id='line_1816'>were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</a>
<a id='line_1817'></a>
<a id='line_1818'>11:18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>11:19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.</a>
<a id='line_1821'></a>
<a id='line_1822'>11:20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour</a>
<a id='line_1823'>you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you</a>
<a id='line_1824'>on the face.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>11:21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.</a>
<a id='line_1827'>Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold</a>
<a id='line_1828'>also.</a>
<a id='line_1829'></a>
<a id='line_1830'>11:22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are</a>
<a id='line_1831'>they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</a>
<a id='line_1832'></a>
<a id='line_1833'>11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in</a>
<a id='line_1834'>labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more</a>
<a id='line_1835'>frequent, in deaths oft.</a>
<a id='line_1836'></a>
<a id='line_1837'>11:24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</a>
<a id='line_1838'></a>
<a id='line_1839'>11:25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I</a>
<a id='line_1840'>suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 11:26</a>
<a id='line_1841'>In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in</a>
<a id='line_1842'>perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in</a>
<a id='line_1843'>the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils</a>
<a id='line_1844'>among false brethren; 11:27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings</a>
<a id='line_1845'>often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</a>
<a id='line_1846'></a>
<a id='line_1847'>11:28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me</a>
<a id='line_1848'>daily, the care of all the churches.</a>
<a id='line_1849'></a>
<a id='line_1850'>11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</a>
<a id='line_1851'>11:30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern</a>

<a id='line_1853'></a>
<a id='line_1854'>11:31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed</a>

<a id='line_1857'>11:32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of</a>

<a id='line_1871'>paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a</a>
<a id='line_1872'>man to utter.</a>
<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>12:5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but</a>
<a id='line_1875'>in mine infirmities.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>12:6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I</a>
<a id='line_1878'>will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me</a>
<a id='line_1879'>above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</a>
<a id='line_1880'></a>
<a id='line_1881'>12:7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance</a>
<a id='line_1882'>of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the</a>
<a id='line_1883'>messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above</a>
<a id='line_1884'>measure.</a>
<a id='line_1885'></a>
<a id='line_1886'>12:8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart</a>
<a id='line_1887'>from me.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>12:9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my</a>
<a id='line_1890'>strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I</a>
<a id='line_1891'>rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon</a>
<a id='line_1892'>me.</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>12:10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in</a>
<a id='line_1895'>necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for</a>
<a id='line_1896'>when I am weak, then am I strong.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>12:11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I</a>
<a id='line_1899'>ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the</a>
<a id='line_1900'>very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>12:12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all</a>
<a id='line_1903'>patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>12:13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this</a>
<a id='line_1907'>wrong.</a>
<a id='line_1908'></a>
<a id='line_1909'>12:14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not</a>
<a id='line_1910'>be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children</a>
<a id='line_1911'>ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</a>
<a id='line_1912'></a>
<a id='line_1913'>12:15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the</a>
<a id='line_1914'>more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>12:16 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty,</a>
<a id='line_1917'>I caught you with guile.</a>
<a id='line_1918'></a>
<a id='line_1919'>12:17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</a>
<a id='line_1920'>12:18 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a</a>
<a id='line_1921'>gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the</a>
<a id='line_1922'>same steps?  12:19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?</a>
<a id='line_1923'>we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved,</a>
<a id='line_1924'>for your edifying.</a>
<a id='line_1925'></a>
<a id='line_1926'>12:20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I</a>
<a id='line_1927'>would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest</a>
<a id='line_1928'>there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,</a>
<a id='line_1929'>swellings, tumults: 12:21 And lest, when I come again, my God will</a>
<a id='line_1930'>humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned</a>
<a id='line_1931'>already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and</a>
<a id='line_1932'>lasciviousness which they have committed.</a>
<a id='line_1933'></a>
<a id='line_1934'>13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or</a>
<a id='line_1935'>three witnesses shall every word be established.</a>
<a id='line_1936'></a>
<a id='line_1937'>13:2 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the</a>
<a id='line_1938'>second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore</a>
<a id='line_1939'>have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not</a>
<a id='line_1940'>spare: 13:3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to</a>
<a id='line_1941'>you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</a>
<a id='line_1942'></a>
<a id='line_1943'>13:4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by</a>
<a id='line_1944'>the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with</a>
<a id='line_1945'>him by the power of God toward you.</a>
<a id='line_1946'></a>
<a id='line_1947'>13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own</a>
<a id='line_1948'>selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,</a>
<a id='line_1949'>except ye be reprobates?  13:6 But I trust that ye shall know that we</a>
<a id='line_1950'>are not reprobates.</a>
<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>13:7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear</a>
<a id='line_1953'>approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as</a>
<a id='line_1954'>reprobates.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>13:8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</a>
<a id='line_1957'></a>
<a id='line_1958'>13:9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this</a>
<a id='line_1959'>also we wish, even your perfection.</a>
<a id='line_1960'></a>
<a id='line_1961'>13:10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present</a>
<a id='line_1962'>I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath</a>
<a id='line_1963'>given me to edification, and not to destruction.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'>13:11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be</a>
<a id='line_1966'>of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be</a>
<a id='line_1967'>with you.</a>
<a id='line_1968'></a>
<a id='line_1969'>13:12 Greet one another with an holy kiss.</a>
<a id='line_1970'></a>
<a id='line_1971'>13:13 All the saints salute you.</a>
<a id='line_1972'></a>
<a id='line_1973'>13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the</a>
<a id='line_1974'>communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_1975'></a>
