<a id='line_1'>THE ODYSSEY OF HOMER</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>BOOK I</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>MINERVA'S DESCENT TO ITHACA.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses</a>
<a id='line_10'>in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of</a>
<a id='line_11'>Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method</a>
<a id='line_12'>of his departure from thence and his return to his native country.</a>
<a id='line_13'>For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and</a>
<a id='line_14'>Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with</a>
<a id='line_15'>Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she</a>
<a id='line_16'>advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to</a>
<a id='line_17'>Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then,</a>
<a id='line_18'>after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The</a>
<a id='line_19'>suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her</a>
<a id='line_20'>palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the</a>
<a id='line_21'>Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise</a>
<a id='line_22'>between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to</a>
<a id='line_23'>meet the day following.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_28'>Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound;</a>
<a id='line_29'>Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall</a>
<a id='line_30'>Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall,</a>
<a id='line_31'>Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray'd,</a>
<a id='line_32'>Their manners noted, and their states survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_33'>On stormy seas unnumber'd toils he bore,</a>
<a id='line_34'>Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore:</a>
<a id='line_35'>Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey</a>
<a id='line_36'>On herds devoted to the god of day;</a>
<a id='line_37'>The god vindictive doom'd them never more</a>
<a id='line_38'>(Ah, men unbless'd!) to touch that natal shore.</a>
<a id='line_15633'>"Descended from the gods! Ulysses, cease;</a>
<a id='line_15634'>Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace."</a>
<a id='line_15635'></a>
<a id='line_15636'>So Pallas spoke: the mandate from above</a>
<a id='line_15637'>The king obey'd. The virgin-seed of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_15638'>In Mentor's form, confirm'd the full accord,</a>
<a id='line_15639'>And willing nations knew their lawful lord.</a>
