<a id='line_9'>      The character of the prince who removed the seat of empire, and</a>
<a id='line_10'>      introduced such important changes into the civil and religious</a>
<a id='line_11'>      constitution of his country, has fixed the attention, and divided</a>
<a id='line_12'>      the opinions, of mankind. By the grateful zeal of the Christians,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every</a>
<a id='line_14'>      attribute of a hero, and even of a saint; while the discontent of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      the vanquished party has compared Constantine to the most</a>
<a id='line_16'>      abhorred of those tyrants, who, by their vice and weakness,</a>
<a id='line_17'>      dishonored the Imperial purple. The same passions have in some</a>
<a id='line_18'>      degree been perpetuated to succeeding generations, and the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      character of Constantine is considered, even in the present age,</a>
<a id='line_20'>      as an object either of satire or of panegyric. By the impartial</a>
<a id='line_21'>      union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest</a>
<a id='line_22'>      admirers, and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his</a>
<a id='line_23'>      most-implacable enemies, we might hope to delineate a just</a>
<a id='line_24'>      portrait of that extraordinary man, which the truth and candor of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      history should adopt without a blush. 1 But it would soon appear,</a>
<a id='line_26'>      that the vain attempt to blend such discordant colors, and to</a>
<a id='line_27'>      reconcile such inconsistent qualities, must produce a figure</a>
<a id='line_28'>      monstrous rather than human, unless it is viewed in its proper</a>
<a id='line_29'>      and distinct lights, by a careful separation of the different</a>
<a id='line_30'>      periods of the reign of Constantine.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>      1 (return) [ On ne se trompera point sur Constantin, en croyant</a>
<a id='line_33'>      tout le mal ruÕen dit Eusebe, et tout le bien quÕen dit Zosime.</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Fleury, Hist. Ecclesiastique, tom. iii. p. 233. Eusebius and</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Zosimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective.</a>
<a id='line_36'>      The intermediate shades are expressed by those writers, whose</a>
<a id='line_37'>      character or situation variously tempered the influence of their</a>
<a id='line_38'>      religious zeal.]</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>      The person, as well as the mind, of Constantine, had been</a>
<a id='line_41'>      enriched by nature with her choicest endowments. His stature was</a>
<a id='line_42'>      lofty, his countenance majestic, his deportment graceful; his</a>
<a id='line_43'>      strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise, and</a>
<a id='line_44'>      from his earliest youth, to a very advanced season of life, he</a>
<a id='line_45'>      preserved the vigor of his constitution by a strict adherence to</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance. He delighted in</a>
<a id='line_47'>      the social intercourse of familiar conversation; and though he</a>
<a id='line_48'>      might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less</a>
<a id='line_49'>      reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station,</a>
<a id='line_50'>      the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      all who approached him. The sincerity of his friendship has been</a>
<a id='line_52'>      suspected; yet he showed, on some occasions, that he was not</a>
<a id='line_53'>      incapable of a warm and lasting attachment. The disadvantage of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just</a>
<a id='line_55'>      estimate of the value of learning; and the arts and sciences</a>
<a id='line_56'>      derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of</a>
<a id='line_57'>      Constantine. In the despatch of business, his diligence was</a>
<a id='line_58'>      indefatigable; and the active powers of his mind were almost</a>
<a id='line_59'>      continually exercised in reading, writing, or meditating, in</a>
<a id='line_60'>      giving audiences to ambassadors, and in examining the complaints</a>
<a id='line_61'>      of his subjects. Even those who censured the propriety of his</a>
<a id='line_62'>      measures were compelled to acknowledge, that he possessed</a>
<a id='line_63'>      magnanimity to conceive, and patience to execute, the most</a>
<a id='line_64'>      arduous designs, without being checked either by the prejudices</a>
<a id='line_65'>      of education, or by the clamors of the multitude. In the field,</a>
<a id='line_66'>      he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops, whom he</a>
<a id='line_67'>      conducted with the talents of a consummate general; and to his</a>
<a id='line_68'>      abilities, rather than to his fortune, we may ascribe the signal</a>
<a id='line_69'>      victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of</a>
<a id='line_70'>      the republic. He loved glory as the reward, perhaps as the</a>
<a id='line_71'>      motive, of his labors. The boundless ambition, which, from the</a>
<a id='line_72'>      moment of his accepting the purple at York, appears as the ruling</a>
<a id='line_73'>      passion of his soul, may be justified by the dangers of his own</a>
<a id='line_74'>      situation, by the character of his rivals, by the consciousness</a>
<a id='line_75'>      of superior merit, and by the prospect that his success would</a>
<a id='line_76'>      enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire.</a>
<a id='line_77'>      In his civil wars against Maxentius and Licinius, he had engaged</a>
<a id='line_78'>      on his side the inclinations of the people, who compared the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and</a>
<a id='line_80'>      justice which seemed to direct the general tenor of the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      administration of Constantine. 2</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>      2 (return) [ The virtues of Constantine are collected for the</a>
<a id='line_84'>      most part from Eutropius and the younger Victor, two sincere</a>
<a id='line_85'>      pagans, who wrote after the extinction of his family. Even</a>
<a id='line_86'>      Zosimus, and the _Emperor_ Julian, acknowledge his personal</a>
<a id='line_87'>      courage and military achievements.]</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>      Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the Tyber, or even in the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      plains of Hadrianople, such is the character which, with a few</a>
<a id='line_91'>      exceptions, he might have transmitted to posterity. But the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      conclusion of his reign (according to the moderate and indeed</a>
<a id='line_93'>      tender sentence of a writer of the same age) degraded him from</a>
<a id='line_94'>      the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      Roman princes. 3 In the life of Augustus, we behold the tyrant of</a>
<a id='line_96'>      the republic, converted, almost by imperceptible degrees, into</a>
<a id='line_97'>      the father of his country, and of human kind. In that of</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Constantine, we may contemplate a hero, who had so long inspired</a>
<a id='line_99'>      his subjects with love, and his enemies with terror, degenerating</a>
<a id='line_100'>      into a cruel and dissolute monarch, corrupted by his fortune, or</a>
<a id='line_101'>      raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation. The</a>
<a id='line_102'>      general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen years</a>
<a id='line_103'>      of his reign, was a period of apparent splendor rather than of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      real prosperity; and the old age of Constantine was disgraced by</a>
<a id='line_105'>      the opposite yet reconcilable vices of rapaciousness and</a>
<a id='line_106'>      prodigality. The accumulated treasures found in the palaces of</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Maxentius and Licinius, were lavishly consumed; the various</a>
<a id='line_108'>      innovations introduced by the conqueror, were attended with an</a>
<a id='line_109'>      increasing expense; the cost of his buildings, his court, and his</a>
<a id='line_110'>      festivals, required an immediate and plentiful supply; and the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      oppression of the people was the only fund which could support</a>
<a id='line_112'>      the magnificence of the sovereign. 4 His unworthy favorites,</a>
<a id='line_113'>      enriched by the boundless liberality of their master, usurped</a>
<a id='line_114'>      with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption. 5 A secret</a>
<a id='line_115'>      but universal decay was felt in every part of the public</a>
<a id='line_116'>      administration, and the emperor himself, though he still retained</a>
<a id='line_117'>      the obedience, gradually lost the esteem, of his subjects. The</a>
<a id='line_118'>      dress and manners, which, towards the decline of life, he chose</a>
<a id='line_119'>      to affect, served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind. The</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Asiatic pomp, which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian,</a>
<a id='line_121'>      assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      Constantine. He is represented with false hair of various colors,</a>
<a id='line_123'>      laboriously arranged by the skilful artists to the times; a</a>
<a id='line_124'>      diadem of a new and more expensive fashion; a profusion of gems</a>
<a id='line_125'>      and pearls, of collars and bracelets, and a variegated flowing</a>
<a id='line_126'>      robe of silk, most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold. In</a>
<a id='line_127'>      such apparel, scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of</a>
<a id='line_128'>      Elagabalus, we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged</a>
<a id='line_129'>      monarch, and the simplicity of a Roman veteran. 6 A mind thus</a>
<a id='line_130'>      relaxed by prosperity and indulgence, was incapable of rising to</a>
<a id='line_131'>      that magnanimity which disdains suspicion, and dares to forgive.</a>
<a id='line_132'>      The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be justified by</a>
<a id='line_133'>      the maxims of policy, as they are taught in the schools of</a>
<a id='line_134'>      tyrants; but an impartial narrative of the executions, or rather</a>
<a id='line_135'>      murders, which sullied the declining age of Constantine, will</a>
<a id='line_136'>      suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who</a>
<a id='line_137'>      could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice, and the</a>
<a id='line_138'>      feelings of nature, to the dictates either of his passions or of</a>
<a id='line_139'>      his interest.</a>

<a id='line_166'>      p. 156, 299, 397, 459.) Eusebius (Orat. c. 5) alleges, that</a>
<a id='line_167'>      Constantine dressed for the public, not for himself. Were this</a>
<a id='line_168'>      admitted, the vainest coxcomb could never want an excuse.]</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>      The same fortune which so invariably followed the standard of</a>
<a id='line_171'>      Constantine, seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his</a>
<a id='line_172'>      domestic life. Those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_173'>      longest and most prosperous reigns, Augustus Trajan, and</a>
<a id='line_174'>      Diocletian, had been disappointed of posterity; and the frequent</a>
<a id='line_175'>      revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any Imperial</a>
<a id='line_176'>      family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple. But</a>
<a id='line_177'>      the royalty of the Flavian line, which had been first ennobled by</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the Gothic Claudius, descended through several generations; and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Constantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary</a>
<a id='line_180'>      honors which he transmitted to his children. The emperor had been</a>
<a id='line_181'>      twice married. Minervina, the obscure but lawful object of his</a>
<a id='line_182'>      youthful attachment, 7 had left him only one son, who was called</a>
<a id='line_183'>      Crispus. By Fausta, the daughter of Maximian, he had three</a>
<a id='line_184'>      daughters, and three sons known by the kindred names of</a>
<a id='line_185'>      Constantine, Constantius, and Constans. The unambitious brothers</a>
<a id='line_186'>      of the great Constantine, Julius Constantius, Dalmatius, and</a>
<a id='line_187'>      Hannibalianus, 8 were permitted to enjoy the most honorable rank,</a>
<a id='line_188'>      and the most affluent fortune, that could be consistent with a</a>
<a id='line_189'>      private station. The youngest of the three lived without a name,</a>
<a id='line_190'>      and died without posterity. His two elder brothers obtained in</a>
<a id='line_191'>      marriage the daughters of wealthy senators, and propagated new</a>
<a id='line_192'>      branches of the Imperial race. Gallus and Julian afterwards</a>
<a id='line_193'>      became the most illustrious of the children of Julius</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Constantius, the _Patrician_. The two sons of Dalmatius, who had</a>
<a id='line_195'>      been decorated with the vain title of _Censor_, were named</a>
<a id='line_196'>      Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The two sisters of the great</a>
<a id='line_197'>      Constantine, Anastasia and Eutropia, were bestowed on Optatus and</a>
<a id='line_198'>      Nepotianus, two senators of noble birth and of consular dignity.</a>
<a id='line_199'>      His third sister, Constantia, was distinguished by her</a>
<a id='line_200'>      pre‘minence of greatness and of misery. She remained the widow of</a>
<a id='line_201'>      the vanquished Licinius; and it was by her entreaties, that an</a>
<a id='line_202'>      innocent boy, the offspring of their marriage, preserved, for</a>
<a id='line_203'>      some time, his life, the title of C¾sar, and a precarious hope of</a>
<a id='line_204'>      the succession. Besides the females, and the allies of the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      Flavian house, ten or twelve males, to whom the language of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood,</a>
<a id='line_207'>      seemed, according to the order of their birth, to be destined</a>
<a id='line_208'>      either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine. But in</a>
<a id='line_209'>      less than thirty years, this numerous and increasing family was</a>
<a id='line_210'>      reduced to the persons of Constantius and Julian, who alone had</a>
<a id='line_211'>      survived a series of crimes and calamities, such as the tragic</a>
<a id='line_212'>      poets have deplored in the devoted lines of Pelops and of Cadmus.</a>

<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>      Crispus, the eldest son of Constantine, and the presumptive heir</a>
<a id='line_227'>      of the empire, is represented by impartial historians as an</a>
<a id='line_228'>      amiable and accomplished youth. The care of his education, or at</a>
<a id='line_229'>      least of his studies, was intrusted to Lactantius, the most</a>
<a id='line_230'>      eloquent of the Christians; a preceptor admirably qualified to</a>
<a id='line_231'>      form the taste, and the excite the virtues, of his illustrious</a>
<a id='line_232'>      disciple. 9 At the age of seventeen, Crispus was invested with</a>
<a id='line_233'>      the title of C¾sar, and the administration of the Gallic</a>
<a id='line_234'>      provinces, where the inroads of the Germans gave him an early</a>
<a id='line_235'>      occasion of signalizing his military prowess. In the civil war</a>
<a id='line_236'>      which broke out soon afterwards, the father and son divided their</a>
<a id='line_237'>      powers; and this history has already celebrated the valor as well</a>
<a id='line_238'>      as conduct displayed by the latter, in forcing the straits of the</a>
<a id='line_239'>      Hellespont, so obstinately defended by the superior fleet of</a>
<a id='line_240'>      Lacinius. This naval victory contributed to determine the event</a>
<a id='line_241'>      of the war; and the names of Constantine and of Crispus were</a>
<a id='line_242'>      united in the joyful acclamations of their eastern subjects; who</a>
<a id='line_243'>      loudly proclaimed, that the world had been subdued, and was now</a>
<a id='line_244'>      governed, by an emperor endowed with every virtue; and by his</a>
<a id='line_245'>      illustrious son, a prince beloved of Heaven, and the lively image</a>
<a id='line_246'>      of his fatherÕs perfections. The public favor, which seldom</a>
<a id='line_247'>      accompanies old age, diffused its lustre over the youth of</a>
<a id='line_248'>      Crispus. He deserved the esteem, and he engaged the affections,</a>
<a id='line_249'>      of the court, the army, and the people. The experienced merit of</a>
<a id='line_250'>      a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his subjects with</a>
<a id='line_251'>      reluctance, and frequently denied with partial and discontented</a>

<a id='line_436'>      the steam of a bath, which, for that purpose, had been heated to</a>
<a id='line_437'>      an extraordinary degree. 24 By some it will perhaps be thought,</a>

<a id='line_522'>      By the death of Crispus, the inheritance of the empire seemed to</a>
<a id='line_523'>      devolve on the three sons of Fausta, who have been already</a>
<a id='line_524'>      mentioned under the names of Constantine, of Constantius, and of</a>
<a id='line_525'>      Constans. These young princes were successively invested with the</a>
<a id='line_526'>      title of C¾sar; and the dates of their promotion may be referred</a>
<a id='line_527'>      to the tenth, the twentieth, and the thirtieth years of the reign</a>
<a id='line_528'>      of their father. 29 This conduct, though it tended to multiply</a>
<a id='line_529'>      the future masters of the Roman world, might be excused by the</a>
<a id='line_530'>      partiality of paternal affection; but it is not so easy to</a>
<a id='line_531'>      understand the motives of the emperor, when he endangered the</a>
<a id='line_532'>      safety both of his family and of his people, by the unnecessary</a>
<a id='line_533'>      elevation of his two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The</a>
<a id='line_534'>      former was raised, by the title of C¾sar, to an equality with his</a>
<a id='line_535'>      cousins. In favor of the latter, Constantine invented the new and</a>
<a id='line_536'>      singular appellation of _Nobilissimus;_ 30 to which he annexed</a>

<a id='line_581'>      infantry. 32 The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed, though</a>
<a id='line_582'>      not perhaps with equal success, to improve the minds of the sons</a>
<a id='line_583'>      and nephews of Constantine. 33 The most celebrated professors of</a>
<a id='line_584'>      the Christian faith, of the Grecian philosophy, and of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_585'>      jurisprudence, were invited by the liberality of the emperor, who</a>
<a id='line_586'>      reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal</a>
<a id='line_587'>      youths in the science of government, and the knowledge of</a>
<a id='line_588'>      mankind. But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by</a>
<a id='line_589'>      adversity and experience. In the free intercourse of private</a>
<a id='line_590'>      life, and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had</a>
<a id='line_591'>      learned to command his own passions, to encounter those of his</a>
<a id='line_592'>      equals, and to depend for his present safety and future greatness</a>
<a id='line_593'>      on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct. His</a>
<a id='line_594'>      destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated</a>
<a id='line_595'>      in the imperial purple. Incessantly surrounded with a train of</a>
<a id='line_596'>      flatterers, they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury,</a>
<a id='line_597'>      and the expectation of a throne; nor would the dignity of their</a>
<a id='line_598'>      rank permit them to descend from that elevated station from</a>
<a id='line_599'>      whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a</a>
<a id='line_600'>      smooth and uniform aspect. The indulgence of Constantine admitted</a>
<a id='line_601'>      them, at a very tender age, to share the administration of the</a>
<a id='line_602'>      empire; and they studied the art of reigning, at the expense of</a>
<a id='line_603'>      the people intrusted to their care. The younger Constantine was</a>
<a id='line_604'>      appointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother Constantius</a>
<a id='line_605'>      exchanged that department, the ancient patrimony of their father,</a>
<a id='line_606'>      for the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East.</a>
<a id='line_607'>      Italy, the Western Illyricum, and Africa, were accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_608'>      revere Constans, the third of his sons, as the representative of</a>
<a id='line_609'>      the great Constantine. He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier,</a>
<a id='line_610'>      to which he annexed the government of Thrace, Macedonia, and</a>
<a id='line_611'>      Greece. The city of C¾sarea was chosen for the residence of</a>
<a id='line_612'>      Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the</a>
<a id='line_613'>      Lesser Armenia, were destined to form the extent of his new</a>
<a id='line_614'>      kingdom. For each of these princes a suitable establishment was</a>
<a id='line_615'>      provided. A just proportion of guards, of legions, and of</a>
<a id='line_616'>      auxiliaries, was allotted for their respective dignity and</a>
<a id='line_617'>      defence. The ministers and generals, who were placed about their</a>
<a id='line_618'>      persons, were such as Constantine could trust to assist, and even</a>
<a id='line_619'>      to control, these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their</a>
<a id='line_620'>      delegated power. As they advanced in years and experience, the</a>
<a id='line_621'>      limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged: but the</a>

<a id='line_659'>      spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the</a>
<a id='line_660'>      Vistula and the Volga. 36 The care of their numerous flocks and</a>
<a id='line_661'>      herds, the pursuit of game, and the exercises of war, or rather</a>
<a id='line_662'>      of rapine, directed the vagrant motions of the Sarmatians. The</a>
<a id='line_663'>      movable camps or cities, the ordinary residence of their wives</a>
<a id='line_664'>      and children, consisted only of large wagons drawn by oxen, and</a>
<a id='line_665'>      covered in the form of tents. The military strength of the nation</a>
<a id='line_666'>      was composed of cavalry; and the custom of their warriors, to</a>

<a id='line_677'>      of arrows. They were reduced to the necessity of employing</a>

<a id='line_1421'>      dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      strength, and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labors. But the</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory. His army, of</a>

<a id='line_1497'>      been deservedly esteemed the bulwark of the East, sustained three</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      memorable sieges against the power of Sapor; and the disappointed</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      monarch, after urging his attacks above sixty, eighty, and a</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      hundred days, was thrice repulsed with loss and ignominy. 63 This</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      large and populous city was situate about two daysÕ journey from</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      the Tigris, in the midst of a pleasant and fertile plain at the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      foot of Mount Masius. A treble enclosure of brick walls was</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      defended by a deep ditch; 64 and the intrepid resistance of Count</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      Lucilianus, and his garrison, was seconded by the desperate</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      courage of the people. The citizens of Nisibis were animated by</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      the exhortations of their bishop, 65 inured to arms by the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      presence of danger, and convinced of the intentions of Sapor to</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      plant a Persian colony in their room, and to lead them away into</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      distant and barbarous captivity. The event of the two former</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      sieges elated their confidence, and exasperated the haughty</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      spirit of the Great King, who advanced a third time towards</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      Nisibis, at the head of the united forces of Persia and India.</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      The ordinary machines, invented to batter or undermine the walls,</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the Romans;</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      and many days had vainly elapsed, when Sapor embraced a</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      resolution worthy of an eastern monarch, who believed that the</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      elements themselves were subject to his power. At the stated</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      season of the melting of the snows in Armenia, the River</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      Mygdonius, which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis,</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      forms, like the Nile, 66 an inundation over the adjacent country.</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      By the labor of the Persians, the course of the river was stopped</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      below the town, and the waters were confined on every side by</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      solid mounds of earth. On this artificial lake, a fleet of armed</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      vessels filled with soldiers, and with engines which discharged</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      stones of five hundred pounds weight, advanced in order of</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      battle, and engaged, almost upon a level, the troops which</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      defended the ramparts. 6611 The irresistible force of the waters</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      was alternately fatal to the contending parties, till at length a</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      portion of the walls, unable to sustain the accumulated pressure,</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      gave way at once, and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      fifty feet. The Persians were instantly driven to the assault,</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the day. The</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      embarrassed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters. The</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      elephants, made furious by their wounds, increased the disorder,</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      and trampled down thousands of the Persian archers. The Great</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      King, who, from an exalted throne, beheld the misfortunes of his</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      arms, sounded, with reluctant indignation, the signal of the</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      retreat, and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      attack. But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      night; and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      height, rising every moment to fill up the interval of the</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      breach. Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes, and the</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      loss of more than twenty thousand men, Sapor still pressed the</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      reduction of Nisibis, with an obstinate firmness, which could</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      provinces of Persia against a formidable invasion of the</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      Massaget¾. 67 Alarmed by this intelligence, he hastily</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      relinquished the siege, and marched with rapid diligence from the</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus. The danger and</a>

<a id='line_1607'>      themselves with the dominions which they were unqualified to</a>

<a id='line_1609'>      defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      kinsmen; and though he might yield to the superior guilt and</a>

<a id='line_1612'>      African provinces, as an equivalent for the rich countries of</a>
<a id='line_1613'>      Macedonia and Greece, which his brother had acquired by the death</a>
<a id='line_1614'>      of Dalmatius. The want of sincerity, which Constantine</a>

<a id='line_1616'>      the fierceness of his temper; and he eagerly listened to those</a>

<a id='line_1622'>      the first effects of his resentment. The measures of Constans,</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      who then resided in Dacia, were directed with more prudence and</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      ability. On the news of his brotherÕs invasion, he detached a</a>

<a id='line_1652'>      The fate of Constans himself was delayed about ten years longer,</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      and the revenge of his brotherÕs death was reserved for the more</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      ignoble hand of a domestic traitor. The pernicious tendency of</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      the system introduced by Constantine was displayed in the feeble</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      administration of his sons; who, by their vices and weakness,</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      soon lost the esteem and affections of their people. The pride</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      assumed by Constans, from the unmerited success of his arms, was</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      application. His fond partiality towards some German captives,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      distinguished only by the charms of youth, was an object of</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      scandal to the people; 69 and Magnentius, an ambitious soldier,</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      who was himself of Barbarian extraction, was encouraged by the</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      public discontent to assert the honor of the Roman name. 70 The</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians, who acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      Magnentius as their leader, maintained the most respectable and</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      important station in the Imperial camp. The friendship of</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      Marcellinus, count of the sacred largesses, supplied with a</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      liberal hand the means of seduction. The soldiers were convinced</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      by the most specious arguments, that the republic summoned them</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      to break the bonds of hereditary servitude; and, by the choice of</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      an active and vigilant prince, to reward the same virtues which</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      had raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constans from a</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      private condition to the throne of the world. As soon as the</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      conspiracy was ripe for execution, Marcellinus, under the</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      pretence of celebrating his sonÕs birthday, gave a splendid</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      entertainment to the _illustrious_ and _honorable_ persons of the</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      court of Gaul, which then resided in the city of Autun. The</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      late hour of the night; and the unsuspecting guests were tempted</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      conversation. On a sudden the doors were thrown open, and</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      Magnentius, who had retired for a few moments, returned into the</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      apartment, invested with the diadem and purple. The conspirators</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      instantly saluted him with the titles of Augustus and Emperor.</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      The surprise, the terror, the intoxication, the ambitious hopes,</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly, prompted</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      them to join their voices to the general acclamation. The guards</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      hastened to take the oath of fidelity; the gates of the town were</a>

<a id='line_1757'>      disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus. Perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      it was without the consent of Constantina, that the new emperor</a>

<a id='line_1795'>      ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin</a>

<a id='line_1800'>      so many triumphs. Such propositions and such arguments appeared</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      to deserve the most serious attention; the answer of Constantius</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      was deferred till the next day; and as he had reflected on the</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      people, he thus addressed his council, who listened with real or</a>

<a id='line_1808'>      awakened me to revenge, forbade me to despair of the republic,</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      crown the justice of my arms.Ó The authority of such a vision, or</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      rather of the prince who alleged it, silenced every doubt, and</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      excluded all negotiation. The ignominious terms of peace were</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      rejected with disdain. One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      dismissed with the haughty answer of Constantius; his colleagues,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations, were put in</a>

<a id='line_1821'></a>
<a id='line_1822'>      Such was the conduct, and such perhaps was the duty, of the</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      brother of Constans towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul. The</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      situation and character of Vetranio admitted of milder measures;</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      and the policy of the Eastern emperor was directed to disunite</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      his antagonists, and to separate the forces of Illyricum from the</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      cause of rebellion. It was an easy task to deceive the frankness</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      and simplicity of Vetranio, who, fluctuating some time between</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      the opposite views of honor and interest, displayed to the world</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      the insincerity of his temper, and was insensibly engaged in the</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      snares of an artful negotiation. Constantius acknowledged him as</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire, on condition that</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius, and</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      provinces; where they might pledge their friendship by mutual</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      vows of fidelity, and regulate by common consent the future</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      operations of the civil war. In consequence of this agreement,</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica, 76 at the head of</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      twenty thousand horse, and of a more numerous body of infantry; a</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      power so far superior to the forces of Constantius, that the</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      Illyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      rival, who, depending on the success of his private negotiations,</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      had seduced the troops, and undermined the throne, of Vetranio.</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      The chiefs, who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius,</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      prepared in his favor a public spectacle, calculated to discover</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      and inflame the passions of the multitude. 77 The united armies</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city. In the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      centre, according to the rules of ancient discipline, a military</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      tribunal, or rather scaffold, was erected, from whence the</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      emperors were accustomed, on solemn and important occasions, to</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      harangue the troops. The well-ordered ranks of Romans and</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      Barbarians, with drawn swords, or with erected spears, the</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      squadrons of cavalry, and the cohorts of infantry, distinguished</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      by the variety of their arms and ensigns, formed an immense</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      circle round the tribunal; and the attentive silence which they</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamor or</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      of applause. In the presence of this formidable assembly, the two</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      affairs: the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      Constantius; and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      of rhetoric, he acquitted himself, under these difficult</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      circumstances, with firmness, dexterity, and eloquence. The first</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      of Gaul; but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      Constans, he insinuated, that none, except a brother, could claim</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      a right to the succession of his brother. He displayed, with some</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      complacency, the glories of his Imperial race; and recalled to</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      the memory of the troops the valor, the triumphs, the liberality</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      of the great Constantine, to whose sons they had engaged their</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      allegiance by an oath of fidelity, which the ingratitude of his</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      most favored servants had tempted them to violate. The officers,</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      who surrounded the tribunal, and were instructed to act their</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      part in this extraordinary scene, confessed the irresistible</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      power of reason and eloquence, by saluting the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      Constantius as their lawful sovereign. The contagion of loyalty</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      and repentance was communicated from rank to rank; till the plain</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      of Sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of ÒAway with</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      these upstart usurpers! Long life and victory to the son of</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      Constantine! Under his banners alone we will fight and conquer.Ó</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      The shout of thousands, their menacing gestures, the fierce</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      clashing of their arms, astonished and subdued the courage of</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      Vetranio, who stood, amidst the defection of his followers, in</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      anxious and silent suspense. Instead of embracing the last refuge</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      of generous despair, he tamely submitted to his fate; and taking</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      the diadem from his head, in the view of both armies fell</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      prostrate at the feet of his conqueror. Constantius used his</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      victory with prudence and moderation; and raising from the ground</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      the aged suppliant, whom he affected to style by the endearing</a>

<a id='line_1927'>      presented a spacious theatre; and the operations of the civil war</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      of the combatants. 81 Constantius had declared his intention of</a>

<a id='line_1931'>      animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory, which, on</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      the same auspicious ground, had been obtained by the arms of his</a>

<a id='line_1936'></a>
<a id='line_1937'>      It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to compel his</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      adversary to relinquish this advantageous position; and he</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      employed, with that view, the various marches, evolutions, and</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      stratagems, which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      to an experienced officer. He carried by assault the important</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      town of Siscia; made an attack on the city of Sirmium, which lay</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      in the rear of the Imperial camp, attempted to force a passage</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      over the Save into the eastern provinces of Illyricum; and cut in</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      pieces a numerous detachment, which he had allured into the</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      narrow passes of Adarne. During the greater part of the summer,</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      the tyrant of Gaul showed himself master of the field. The troops</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      of Constantius were harassed and dispirited; his reputation</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      declined in the eye of the world; and his pride condescended to</a>

<a id='line_1953'>      Imperial ambassador; and the council as well as the army of</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      Magnentius were disposed to accept them. But the haughty usurper,</a>

<a id='line_1956'>      Philip should be detained as a captive, or, at least, as a</a>

<a id='line_1990'>      bridge of boats, five miles in length, over the River Drave, and</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      the adjacent morasses, 82 has been always considered as a place</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      of importance in the wars of Hungary. Magnentius, directing his</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      march towards Mursa, set fire to the gates, and, by a sudden</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      assault, had almost scaled the walls of the town. The vigilance</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      of the garrison extinguished the flames; the approach of</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      Constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      siege; and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      embarrass his motions, by forcing a body of troops which had</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre. The field of battle</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      round Mursa was a naked and level plain: on this ground the army</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      of Constantius formed, with the Drave on their right; while their</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      left, either from the nature of their disposition, or from the</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      superiority of their cavalry, extended far beyond the right flank</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      of Magnentius. 83 The troops on both sides remained under arms,</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      in anxious expectation, during the greatest part of the morning;</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      and the son of Constantine, after animating his soldiers by an</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      eloquent speech, retired into a church at some distance from the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      field of battle, and committed to his generals the conduct of</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      this decisive day. 84 They deserved his confidence by the valor</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      and military skill which they exerted. They wisely began the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      action upon the left; and advancing their whole wing of cavalry</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      in an oblique line, they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      of the enemy, which was unprepared to resist the impetuosity of</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      their charge. But the Romans of the West soon rallied, by the</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      habits of discipline; and the Barbarians of Germany supported the</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      renown of their national bravery. The engagement soon became</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      general; was maintained with various and singular turns of</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      fortune; and scarcely ended with the darkness of the night. The</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      signal victory which Constantius obtained is attributed to the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      arms of his cavalry. His cuirassiers are described as so many</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      massy statues of steel, glittering with their scaly armor, and</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the Gallic</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      legions. As soon as the legions gave way, the lighter and more</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      intervals, and completed the disorder. In the mean while, the</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      huge bodies of the Germans were exposed almost naked to the</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      dexterity of the Oriental archers; and whole troops of those</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      Barbarians were urged by anguish and despair to precipitate</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      themselves into the broad and rapid stream of the Drave. 85 The</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      number of the slain was computed at fifty-four thousand men, and</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      of the vanquished; 86 a circumstance which proves the obstinacy</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      of the contest, and justifies the observation of an ancient</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      writer, that the forces of the empire were consumed in the fatal</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      battle of Mursa, by the loss of a veteran army, sufficient to</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      defend the frontiers, or to add new triumphs to the glory of</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      Rome. 87 Notwithstanding the invectives of a servile orator,</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      there is not the least reason to believe that the tyrant deserted</a>

<a id='line_2105'>      deep impression of horror and resentment on the minds of the</a>

<a id='line_2107'>      the nephew of Constantine, had seen with indignation the sceptre</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      of the West usurped by a perfidious barbarian. Arming a desperate</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      troop of slaves and gladiators, he overpowered the feeble guard</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      of the domestic tranquillity of Rome, received the homage of the</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      senate, and assuming the title of Augustus, precariously reigned</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      during a tumult of twenty-eight days. The march of some regular</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      forces put an end to his ambitious hopes: the rebellion was</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      extinguished in the blood of Nepotian, of his mother Eutropia,</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      and of his adherents; and the proscription was extended to all</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      who had contracted a fatal alliance with the name and family of</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      Constantine. 90 But as soon as Constantius, after the battle of</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      Mursa, became master of the sea-coast of Dalmatia, a band of</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      noble exiles, who had ventured to equip a fleet in some harbor of</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      the Adriatic, sought protection and revenge in his victorious</a>
