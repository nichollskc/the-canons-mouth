<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     Sack Of Rome By Genseric, King Of The Vandals.—His Naval</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Depredations.—Succession Of The Last Emperors Of The West,</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Maximus, Avitus, Majorian, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius,</a>
<a id='line_5'>     Glycerius, Nepos, Augustulus.—Total Extinction Of The Western</a>
<a id='line_6'>     Empire.—Reign Of Odoacer, The First Barbarian King Of Italy.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      The loss or desolation of the provinces, from the Ocean to the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Alps, impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her internal</a>
<a id='line_10'>      prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the separation of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Africa. The rapacious Vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates</a>
<a id='line_12'>      of the senators, and intercepted the regular subsidies, which</a>
<a id='line_13'>      relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      plebeians. The distress of the Romans was soon aggravated by an</a>
<a id='line_15'>      unexpected attack; and the province, so long cultivated for their</a>
<a id='line_16'>      use by industrious and obedient subjects, was armed against them</a>
<a id='line_17'>      by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed</a>
<a id='line_18'>      the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and</a>
<a id='line_19'>      fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety</a>
<a id='line_20'>      days’ journey from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits</a>
<a id='line_21'>      were pressed and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert</a>
<a id='line_22'>      and the Mediterranean. The discovery and conquest of the Black</a>
<a id='line_23'>      nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not</a>
<a id='line_24'>      tempt the rational ambition of Genseric; but he cast his eyes</a>
<a id='line_25'>      towards the sea; he resolved to create a naval power, and his</a>
<a id='line_26'>      bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>      The woods of Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of</a>
<a id='line_29'>      timber: his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation</a>
<a id='line_30'>      and ship-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a</a>
<a id='line_31'>      mode of warfare which would render every maritime country</a>
<a id='line_32'>      accessible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by</a>
<a id='line_33'>      the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of six centuries,</a>
<a id='line_34'>      the fleets that issued from the port of Carthage again claimed</a>
<a id='line_35'>      the empire of the Mediterranean. The success of the Vandals, the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      conquest of Sicily, the sack of Palermo, and the frequent</a>
<a id='line_37'>      descents on the coast of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother</a>
<a id='line_38'>      of Valentinian, and the sister of Theodosius. Alliances were</a>
<a id='line_39'>      formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared,</a>
<a id='line_40'>      for the destruction of the common enemy; who reserved his courage</a>
<a id='line_41'>      to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or</a>
<a id='line_42'>      elude. The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly</a>
<a id='line_43'>      baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent</a>
<a id='line_44'>      concessions; and the interposition of his formidable confederate,</a>
<a id='line_45'>      the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_46'>      Africa to the care of their domestic safety. The revolutions of</a>
<a id='line_47'>      the palace, which left the Western empire without a defender, and</a>
<a id='line_48'>      without a lawful prince, dispelled the apprehensions, and</a>
<a id='line_49'>      stimulated the avarice, of Genseric. He immediately equipped a</a>
<a id='line_50'>      numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth</a>
<a id='line_51'>      of the Tyber, about three months after the death of Valentinian,</a>
<a id='line_52'>      and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>      The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus 1 was often</a>
<a id='line_55'>      alleged as a rare example of human felicity. His birth was noble</a>
<a id='line_56'>      and illustrious, since he descended from the Anician family; his</a>
<a id='line_57'>      dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money;</a>
<a id='line_58'>      and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal</a>
<a id='line_59'>      arts and decent manners, which adorn or imitate the inestimable</a>
<a id='line_60'>      gifts of genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table</a>
<a id='line_61'>      was hospitable and elegant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public,</a>
<a id='line_62'>      he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients;</a>
<a id='line_63'>      2 and it is possible that among these clients, he might deserve</a>
<a id='line_64'>      and possess some real friends. His merit was rewarded by the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      favor of the prince and senate: he thrice exercised the office of</a>
<a id='line_66'>      Prætorian præfect of Italy; he was twice invested with the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician. These civil</a>
<a id='line_68'>      honors were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and</a>
<a id='line_69'>      tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or</a>
<a id='line_70'>      reason, were accurately distributed by a water-clock; and this</a>
<a id='line_71'>      avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus</a>
<a id='line_72'>      entertained of his own happiness. The injury which he received</a>
<a id='line_73'>      from the emperor Valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody</a>
<a id='line_74'>      revenge. Yet a philosopher might have reflected, that, if the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      resistance of his wife had been sincere, her chastity was still</a>
<a id='line_76'>      inviolate, and that it could never be restored if she had</a>
<a id='line_77'>      consented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would have</a>
<a id='line_78'>      hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those</a>
<a id='line_79'>      inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      royal house of Theodosius. The imprudent Maximus disregarded</a>
<a id='line_81'>      these salutary considerations; he gratified his resentment and</a>
<a id='line_82'>      ambition; he saw the bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet;</a>
<a id='line_83'>      and he heard himself saluted Emperor by the unanimous voice of</a>
<a id='line_84'>      the senate and people. But the day of his inauguration was the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      last day of his happiness. He was imprisoned (such is the lively</a>
<a id='line_86'>      expression of Sidonius) in the palace; and after passing a</a>
<a id='line_87'>      sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of his</a>
<a id='line_88'>      wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation.</a>
<a id='line_89'>      Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his</a>
<a id='line_90'>      anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius; and when</a>
<a id='line_91'>      he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of</a>
<a id='line_92'>      his former life, the emperor exclaimed, “O fortunate Damocles, 3</a>
<a id='line_93'>      thy reign began and ended with the same dinner;” a well-known</a>
<a id='line_94'>      allusion, which Fulgentius afterwards repeated as an instructive</a>
<a id='line_95'>      lesson for princes and subjects.</a>

<a id='line_100'>      deceased emperor. This epistle, with some indulgence, may claim</a>

<a id='line_115'>      Cicero (Tusculan. v. 20, 21) had so inimitably told.]</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>      The reign of Maximus continued about three months. His hours, of</a>
<a id='line_118'>      which he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or</a>
<a id='line_119'>      guilt, or terror, and his throne was shaken by the seditions of</a>
<a id='line_120'>      the soldiers, the people, and the confederate Barbarians. The</a>
<a id='line_121'>      marriage of his son Paladius with the eldest daughter of the late</a>
<a id='line_122'>      emperor, might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his</a>
<a id='line_123'>      family; but the violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia,</a>
<a id='line_124'>      could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge. His</a>
<a id='line_125'>      own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been seasonably</a>
<a id='line_126'>      removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to</a>
<a id='line_127'>      violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to</a>
<a id='line_128'>      submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she</a>
<a id='line_129'>      suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband. These</a>
<a id='line_130'>      suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of</a>
<a id='line_131'>      Maximus himself; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his</a>
<a id='line_132'>      reluctant bride, who was still conscious that she was descended</a>
<a id='line_133'>      from a line of emperors. From the East, however, Eudoxia could</a>
<a id='line_134'>      not hope to obtain any effectual assistance; her father and her</a>
<a id='line_135'>      aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother languished at Jerusalem in</a>
<a id='line_136'>      disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      hands of a stranger. She directed her eyes towards Carthage;</a>
<a id='line_138'>      secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and</a>
<a id='line_139'>      persuaded Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising</a>
<a id='line_140'>      his rapacious designs by the specious names of honor, justice,</a>
<a id='line_141'>      and compassion. 4 Whatever abilities Maximus might have shown in</a>
<a id='line_142'>      a subordinate station, he was found incapable of administering an</a>
<a id='line_143'>      empire; and though he might easily have been informed of the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of</a>
<a id='line_145'>      Africa, he expected with supine indifference the approach of the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of negotiation,</a>
<a id='line_147'>      or of a timely retreat. When the Vandals disembarked at the mouth</a>
<a id='line_148'>      of the Tyber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy</a>
<a id='line_149'>      by the clamors of a trembling and exasperated multitude. The only</a>
<a id='line_150'>      hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a</a>
<a id='line_151'>      precipitate flight, and he exhorted the senators to imitate the</a>
<a id='line_152'>      example of their prince. But no sooner did Maximus appear in the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      streets, than he was assaulted by a shower of stones; a Roman, or</a>
<a id='line_154'>      a Burgundian soldier, claimed the honor of the first wound; his</a>
<a id='line_155'>      mangled body was ignominiously cast into the Tyber; the Roman</a>
<a id='line_156'>      people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the</a>
<a id='line_157'>      author of the public calamities; and the domestics of Eudoxia</a>
<a id='line_158'>      signalized their zeal in the service of their mistress. 5</a>

<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>      On the third day after the tumult, Genseric boldly advanced from</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city. Instead</a>
<a id='line_179'>      of a sally of the Roman youth, there issued from the gates an</a>
<a id='line_180'>      unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his</a>
<a id='line_181'>      clergy. 6 The fearless spirit of Leo, his authority and</a>
<a id='line_182'>      eloquence, again mitigated the fierceness of a Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_183'>      conqueror; the king of the Vandals promised to spare the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings from fire, and to</a>
<a id='line_185'>      exempt the captives from torture; and although such orders were</a>
<a id='line_186'>      neither seriously given, nor strictly obeyed, the mediation of</a>
<a id='line_187'>      Leo was glorious to himself, and in some degree beneficial to his</a>
<a id='line_188'>      country. But Rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors, whose blind passions</a>
<a id='line_190'>      revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage lasted fourteen</a>
<a id='line_191'>      days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private</a>
<a id='line_192'>      wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was diligently transported</a>
<a id='line_193'>      to the vessels of Genseric. Among the spoils, the splendid relics</a>
<a id='line_194'>      of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable</a>
<a id='line_195'>      example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>      Since the abolition of Paganism, the Capitol had been violated</a>
<a id='line_198'>      and abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still</a>
<a id='line_199'>      respected, and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for</a>
<a id='line_200'>      the rapacious hands of Genseric. 7 The holy instruments of the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      Jewish worship, 8 the gold table, and the gold candlestick with</a>
<a id='line_202'>      seven branches, originally framed according to the particular</a>
<a id='line_203'>      instructions of God himself, and which were placed in the</a>
<a id='line_204'>      sanctuary of his temple, had been ostentatiously displayed to the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      Roman people in the triumph of Titus. They were afterwards</a>
<a id='line_206'>      deposited in the temple of Peace; and at the end of four hundred</a>
<a id='line_207'>      years, the spoils of Jerusalem were transferred from Rome to</a>
<a id='line_208'>      Carthage, by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the shores</a>
<a id='line_209'>      of the Baltic. These ancient monuments might attract the notice</a>
<a id='line_210'>      of curiosity, as well as of avarice. But the Christian churches,</a>
<a id='line_211'>      enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times,</a>
<a id='line_212'>      afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege; and the pious</a>
<a id='line_213'>      liberality of Pope Leo, who melted six silver vases, the gift of</a>
<a id='line_214'>      Constantine, each of a hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of</a>
<a id='line_215'>      the damage which he attempted to repair. In the forty-five years</a>
<a id='line_216'>      that had elapsed since the Gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury</a>
<a id='line_217'>      of Rome were in some measure restored; and it was difficult</a>
<a id='line_218'>      either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who</a>
<a id='line_219'>      possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth</a>
<a id='line_220'>      of the capital. The Imperial ornaments of the palace, the</a>
<a id='line_221'>      magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy</a>
<a id='line_222'>      plate, were accumulated with disorderly rapine; the gold and</a>
<a id='line_223'>      silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the brass</a>
<a id='line_224'>      and copper were laboriously removed. Eudoxia herself, who</a>
<a id='line_225'>      advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed the</a>
<a id='line_226'>      imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely stripped of her</a>
<a id='line_227'>      jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters, the</a>
<a id='line_228'>      only surviving remains of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as</a>
<a id='line_229'>      a captive, to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately hoisted</a>
<a id='line_230'>      sail, and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of</a>
<a id='line_231'>      Carthage. 9 Many thousand Romans of both sexes, chosen for some</a>
<a id='line_232'>      useful or agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board</a>
<a id='line_233'>      the fleet of Genseric; and their distress was aggravated by the</a>
<a id='line_234'>      unfeeling Barbarians, who, in the division of the booty,</a>
<a id='line_235'>      separated the wives from their husbands, and the children from</a>
<a id='line_236'>      their parents. The charity of Deogratias, bishop of Carthage, 10</a>
<a id='line_237'>      was their only consolation and support. He generously sold the</a>
<a id='line_238'>      gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of</a>
<a id='line_239'>      some, to alleviate the slavery of others, and to assist the wants</a>
<a id='line_240'>      and infirmities of a captive multitude, whose health was impaired</a>
<a id='line_241'>      by the hardships which they had suffered in their passage from</a>
<a id='line_242'>      Italy to Africa. By his order, two spacious churches were</a>
<a id='line_243'>      converted into hospitals; the sick were distributed into</a>
<a id='line_244'>      convenient beds, and liberally supplied with food and medicines;</a>
<a id='line_245'>      and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and</a>
<a id='line_246'>      night, with an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a</a>
<a id='line_247'>      tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services. Compare</a>

<a id='line_302'>      stranger to the general command of the forces of Gaul.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>      Avitus, 12 the stranger, whose merit was so nobly rewarded,</a>
<a id='line_305'>      descended from a wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of</a>
<a id='line_306'>      Auvergne. The convulsions of the times urged him to embrace, with</a>
<a id='line_307'>      the same ardor, the civil and military professions: and the</a>
<a id='line_308'>      indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and</a>
<a id='line_309'>      jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting. Thirty years</a>
<a id='line_310'>      of his life were laudably spent in the public service; he</a>
<a id='line_311'>      alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation; and the</a>
<a id='line_312'>      soldier of Ætius, after executing the most important embassies,</a>
<a id='line_313'>      was raised to the station of Prætorian præfect of Gaul. Either</a>
<a id='line_314'>      the merit of Avitus excited envy, or his moderation was desirous</a>
<a id='line_315'>      of repose, since he calmly retired to an estate, which he</a>
<a id='line_316'>      possessed in the neighborhood of Clermont. A copious stream,</a>
<a id='line_317'>      issuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in many a loud</a>
<a id='line_318'>      and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into a lake about two</a>
<a id='line_319'>      miles in length, and the villa was pleasantly seated on the</a>
<a id='line_320'>      margin of the lake. The baths, the porticos, the summer and</a>
<a id='line_321'>      winter apartments, were adapted to the purposes of luxury and</a>
<a id='line_322'>      use; and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of</a>
<a id='line_323'>      woods, pastures, and meadows. 13 In this retreat, where Avitus</a>
<a id='line_324'>      amused his leisure with books, rural sports, the practice of</a>
<a id='line_325'>      husbandry, and the society of his friends, 14 he received the</a>
<a id='line_326'>      Imperial diploma, which constituted him master-general of the</a>
<a id='line_327'>      cavalry and infantry of Gaul. He assumed the military command;</a>
<a id='line_328'>      the Barbarians suspended their fury; and whatever means he might</a>
<a id='line_329'>      employ, whatever concessions he might be forced to make, the</a>
<a id='line_330'>      people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity. But the fate</a>
<a id='line_331'>      of Gaul depended on the Visigoths; and the Roman general, less</a>
<a id='line_332'>      attentive to his dignity than to the public interest, did not</a>
<a id='line_333'>      disdain to visit Thoulouse in the character of an ambassador. He</a>
<a id='line_334'>      was received with courteous hospitality by Theodoric, the king of</a>
<a id='line_335'>      the Goths; but while Avitus laid the foundations of a solid</a>
<a id='line_336'>      alliance with that powerful nation, he was astonished by the</a>
<a id='line_337'>      intelligence, that the emperor Maximus was slain, and that Rome</a>
<a id='line_338'>      had been pillaged by the Vandals. A vacant throne, which he might</a>
<a id='line_339'>      ascend without guilt or danger, tempted his ambition; 15 and the</a>
<a id='line_340'>      Visigoths were easily persuaded to support his claim by their</a>
<a id='line_341'>      irresistible suffrage. They loved the person of Avitus; they</a>

<a id='line_393'>      epistle, dated from the court of Thoulouse, the orator satisfies</a>
<a id='line_394'>      the curiosity of one of his friends, in the following</a>
<a id='line_395'>      description: 17 “By the majesty of his appearance, Theodoric</a>
<a id='line_396'>      would command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit;</a>
<a id='line_397'>      and although he is born a prince, his merit would dignify a</a>
<a id='line_398'>      private station. He is of a middle stature, his body appears</a>
<a id='line_399'>      rather plump than fat, and in his well-proportioned limbs agility</a>
<a id='line_400'>      is united with muscular strength. 18 If you examine his</a>
<a id='line_401'>      countenance, you will distinguish a high forehead, large shaggy</a>
<a id='line_402'>      eyebrows, an aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of white</a>
<a id='line_403'>      teeth, and a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from</a>
<a id='line_404'>      modesty than from anger. The ordinary distribution of his time,</a>
<a id='line_405'>      as far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely</a>
<a id='line_406'>      represented. Before daybreak, he repairs, with a small train, to</a>
<a id='line_407'>      his domestic chapel, where the service is performed by the Arian</a>
<a id='line_408'>      clergy; but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments,</a>
<a id='line_409'>      consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and</a>
<a id='line_410'>      policy. The rest of the morning is employed in the administration</a>
<a id='line_411'>      of his kingdom. His chair is surrounded by some military officers</a>
<a id='line_412'>      of decent aspect and behavior: the noisy crowd of his Barbarian</a>
<a id='line_413'>      guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are not permitted</a>
<a id='line_414'>      to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the</a>
<a id='line_415'>      council-chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambassadors of the nations</a>
<a id='line_416'>      are successively introduced: Theodoric listens with attention,</a>
<a id='line_417'>      answers them with discreet brevity, and either announces or</a>
<a id='line_418'>      delays, according to the nature of their business, his final</a>
<a id='line_419'>      resolution. About eight (the second hour) he rises from his</a>
<a id='line_420'>      throne, and visits either his treasury or his stables. If he</a>
<a id='line_421'>      chooses to hunt, or at least to exercise himself on horseback,</a>
<a id='line_422'>      his bow is carried by a favorite youth; but when the game is</a>
<a id='line_423'>      marked, he bends it with his own hand, and seldom misses the</a>
<a id='line_424'>      object of his aim: as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such</a>
<a id='line_425'>      ignoble warfare; but as a soldier, he would blush to accept any</a>
<a id='line_426'>      military service which he could perform himself. On common days,</a>
<a id='line_427'>      his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen,</a>
<a id='line_428'>      but every Saturday, many honorable guests are invited to the</a>
<a id='line_429'>      royal table, which, on these occasions, is served with the</a>
<a id='line_430'>      elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and the order and</a>
<a id='line_431'>      diligence of Italy. 19 The gold or silver plate is less</a>
<a id='line_432'>      remarkable for its weight than for the brightness and curious</a>
<a id='line_433'>      workmanship: the taste is gratified without the help of foreign</a>
<a id='line_434'>      and costly luxury; the size and number of the cups of wine are</a>
<a id='line_435'>      regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance; and the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      respectful silence that prevails, is interrupted only by grave</a>
<a id='line_437'>      and instructive conversation. After dinner, Theodoric sometimes</a>
<a id='line_438'>      indulges himself in a short slumber; and as soon as he wakes, he</a>
<a id='line_439'>      calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget</a>
<a id='line_440'>      the royal majesty, and is delighted when they freely express the</a>
<a id='line_441'>      passions which are excited by the incidents of play. At this</a>
<a id='line_442'>      game, which he loves as the image of war, he alternately displays</a>
<a id='line_443'>      his eagerness, his skill, his patience, and his cheerful temper.</a>
<a id='line_444'>      If he loses, he laughs; he is modest and silent if he wins. Yet,</a>
<a id='line_445'>      notwithstanding this seeming indifference, his courtiers choose</a>
<a id='line_446'>      to solicit any favor in the moments of victory; and I myself, in</a>
<a id='line_447'>      my applications to the king, have derived some benefit from my</a>
<a id='line_448'>      losses. 20 About the ninth hour (three o’clock) the tide of</a>
<a id='line_449'>      business again returns, and flows incessantly till after sunset,</a>
<a id='line_450'>      when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of</a>
<a id='line_451'>      suppliants and pleaders. At the supper, a more familiar repast,</a>
<a id='line_452'>      buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced, to divert, not</a>

<a id='line_455'>      banished, and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of</a>
<a id='line_456'>      valor are alone grateful to the ear of Theodoric. He retires from</a>

<a id='line_498'>      Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona,</a>
<a id='line_499'>      afflicted by a hostile invasion, represented their injuries and</a>
<a id='line_500'>      their apprehensions. Count Fronto was despatched, in the name of</a>

<a id='line_510'>      of the Visigoths: the Franks and Burgundians served under his</a>
<a id='line_511'>      standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of</a>
<a id='line_512'>      Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors,</a>
<a id='line_513'>      the absolute possession of his Spanish conquests. The two armies,</a>
<a id='line_514'>      or rather the two nations, encountered each other on the banks of</a>
<a id='line_515'>      the River Urbicus, about twelve miles from Astorga; and the</a>
<a id='line_516'>      decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have</a>
<a id='line_517'>      extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the field of</a>
<a id='line_518'>      battle Theodoric advanced to Braga, their metropolis, which still</a>
<a id='line_519'>      retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and</a>
<a id='line_520'>      dignity. 22 His entrance was not polluted with blood; and the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      Goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more</a>
<a id='line_522'>      especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of</a>
<a id='line_523'>      the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and</a>
<a id='line_524'>      altars were confounded in the universal pillage. The unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_525'>      king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean;</a>
<a id='line_526'>      but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight: he was</a>
<a id='line_527'>      delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither</a>
<a id='line_528'>      desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the</a>
<a id='line_529'>      death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody</a>
<a id='line_530'>      sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his</a>
<a id='line_531'>      victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of</a>
<a id='line_532'>      Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the</a>
<a id='line_533'>      miraculous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was stopped in the full</a>
<a id='line_534'>      career of success, and recalled from Spain before he could</a>
<a id='line_535'>      provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards</a>
<a id='line_536'>      the Pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country</a>
<a id='line_537'>      through which he passed; and, in the sack of Pollentia and</a>
<a id='line_538'>      Astorga, he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel</a>
<a id='line_539'>      enemy. Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in</a>
<a id='line_540'>      the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the</a>
<a id='line_541'>      honor and the interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the</a>
<a id='line_542'>      disgrace of a friend, whom he had seated on the throne of the</a>

<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>      The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the</a>
<a id='line_569'>      emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome, and to accept the</a>
<a id='line_570'>      consulship for the ensuing year. On the first day of January, his</a>
<a id='line_571'>      son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a</a>
<a id='line_572'>      panegyric of six hundred verses; but this composition, though it</a>
<a id='line_573'>      was rewarded with a brass statue, 24 seems to contain a very</a>
<a id='line_574'>      moderate proportion, either of genius or of truth. The poet, if</a>
<a id='line_575'>      we may degrade that sacred name, exaggerates the merit of a</a>
<a id='line_576'>      sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious</a>
<a id='line_577'>      reign was soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a time when</a>
<a id='line_578'>      the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and</a>
<a id='line_579'>      danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury: age</a>
<a id='line_580'>      had not extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused</a>
<a id='line_581'>      of insulting, with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the</a>
<a id='line_582'>      husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated. 25 But the</a>
<a id='line_583'>      Romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to</a>
<a id='line_584'>      acknowledge his virtues. The several parts of the empire became</a>
<a id='line_585'>      every day more alienated from each other; and the stranger of</a>
<a id='line_586'>      Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt. The senate</a>
<a id='line_587'>      asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor;</a>
<a id='line_588'>      and their authority, which had been originally derived from the</a>
<a id='line_589'>      old constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a</a>
<a id='line_590'>      declining monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted</a>
<a id='line_591'>      the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been</a>
<a id='line_592'>      supported, or perhaps inflamed, by the Count Ricimer, one of the</a>
<a id='line_593'>      principal commanders of the Barbarian troops, who formed the</a>
<a id='line_594'>      military defence of Italy. The daughter of Wallia, king of the</a>
<a id='line_595'>      Visigoths, was the mother of Ricimer; but he was descended, on</a>
<a id='line_596'>      the father’s side, from the nation of the Suevi; 26 his pride or</a>
<a id='line_597'>      patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his</a>
<a id='line_598'>      countrymen; and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor in whose</a>
<a id='line_599'>      elevation he had not been consulted. His faithful and important</a>
<a id='line_600'>      services against the common enemy rendered him still more</a>
<a id='line_601'>      formidable; 27 and, after destroying on the coast of Corsica a</a>
<a id='line_602'>      fleet of Vandals, which consisted of sixty galleys, Ricimer</a>
<a id='line_603'>      returned in triumph with the appellation of the Deliverer of</a>
<a id='line_604'>      Italy. He chose that moment to signify to Avitus, that his reign</a>
<a id='line_605'>      was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at a distance from his</a>
<a id='line_606'>      Gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and unavailing</a>
<a id='line_607'>      struggle to abdicate the purple. By the clemency, however, or the</a>
<a id='line_608'>      contempt, of Ricimer, 28 he was permitted to descend from the</a>
<a id='line_609'>      throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia: but</a>
<a id='line_610'>      the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their</a>
<a id='line_611'>      inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death. He fled</a>
<a id='line_612'>      towards the Alps, with the humble hope, not of arming the</a>
<a id='line_613'>      Visigoths in his cause, but of securing his person and treasures</a>
<a id='line_614'>      in the sanctuary of Julian, one of the tutelar saints of</a>

<a id='line_617'>      Brivas, or Brioude, in his native province, and he reposed at the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      feet of his holy patron. 30 Avitus left only one daughter, the</a>
<a id='line_619'>      wife of Sidonius Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony of his</a>
<a id='line_620'>      father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment of</a>

<a id='line_679'>      Majorian has deserved the praises of his contemporaries, and of</a>

<a id='line_683'>      that he excelled, in every virtue, all his predecessors who had</a>
<a id='line_684'>      reigned over the Romans.” 32 Such a testimony may justify at</a>
<a id='line_685'>      least the panegyric of Sidonius; and we may acquiesce in the</a>
<a id='line_686'>      assurance, that, although the obsequious orator would have</a>
<a id='line_687'>      flattered, with equal zeal, the most worthless of princes, the</a>
<a id='line_688'>      extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion,</a>
<a id='line_689'>      within the bounds of truth. 33 Majorian derived his name from his</a>
<a id='line_690'>      maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theodosius,</a>
<a id='line_691'>      had commanded the troops of the Illyrian frontier. He gave his</a>
<a id='line_692'>      daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian, a respectable</a>
<a id='line_693'>      officer, who administered the revenues of Gaul with skill and</a>
<a id='line_694'>      integrity; and generously preferred the friendship of Ætius to</a>
<a id='line_695'>      the tempting offer of an insidious court. His son, the future</a>
<a id='line_696'>      emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms, displayed,</a>
<a id='line_697'>      from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and</a>
<a id='line_698'>      unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He followed the</a>
<a id='line_699'>      standard of Ætius, contributed to his success, shared, and</a>
<a id='line_700'>      sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last excited the jealousy</a>
<a id='line_701'>      of the patrician, or rather of his wife, who forced him to retire</a>
<a id='line_702'>      from the service. 34 Majorian, after the death of Ætius, was</a>
<a id='line_703'>      recalled and promoted; and his intimate connection with Count</a>
<a id='line_704'>      Ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of</a>
<a id='line_705'>      the Western empire. During the vacancy that succeeded the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whose birth</a>
<a id='line_707'>      excluded him from the Imperial dignity, governed Italy with the</a>
<a id='line_708'>      title of Patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous</a>
<a id='line_709'>      station of master-general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after</a>
<a id='line_710'>      an interval of some months, consented to the unanimous wish of</a>
<a id='line_711'>      the Romans, whose favor Majorian had solicited by a recent</a>
<a id='line_712'>      victory over the Alemanni. 35 He was invested with the purple at</a>

<a id='line_799'>      The private and public actions of Majorian are very imperfectly</a>

<a id='line_804'>      capable of applying (as far as such reformation was practicable)</a>
<a id='line_805'>      judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders. 40 His</a>
<a id='line_806'>      regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove,</a>
<a id='line_807'>      or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable grievances. I. From</a>
<a id='line_808'>      the first hour of his reign, he was solicitous (I translate his</a>
<a id='line_809'>      own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials,</a>
<a id='line_810'>      oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and</a>
<a id='line_811'>      superindictions. 41 With this view he granted a universal</a>
<a id='line_812'>      amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of</a>
<a id='line_813'>      tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiscal</a>
<a id='line_814'>      officers might demand from the people. This wise dereliction of</a>
<a id='line_815'>      obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and</a>
<a id='line_816'>      purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject who</a>
<a id='line_817'>      could now look back without despair, might labor with hope and</a>
<a id='line_818'>      gratitude for himself and for his country. II. In the assessment</a>
<a id='line_819'>      and collection of taxes, Majorian restored the ordinary</a>
<a id='line_820'>      jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates; and suppressed the</a>
<a id='line_821'>      extraordinary commissions which had been introduced, in the name</a>
<a id='line_822'>      of the emperor himself, or of the Prætorian præfects. The</a>
<a id='line_823'>      favorite servants, who obtained such irregular powers, were</a>
<a id='line_824'>      insolent in their behavior, and arbitrary in their demands: they</a>
<a id='line_825'>      affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were</a>
<a id='line_826'>      discontented, if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the</a>
<a id='line_827'>      sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One</a>
<a id='line_828'>      instance of their extortion would appear incredible, were it not</a>
<a id='line_829'>      authenticated by the legislator himself. They exacted the whole</a>
<a id='line_830'>      payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_831'>      and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with</a>
<a id='line_832'>      the names of Faustina or the Antonines. The subject, who was</a>
<a id='line_833'>      unprovided with these curious medals, had recourse to the</a>
<a id='line_834'>      expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or if he</a>
<a id='line_835'>      succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled, according</a>
<a id='line_836'>      to the weight and value of the money of former times. 42 III.</a>
<a id='line_837'>      “The municipal corporations, (says the emperor,) the lesser</a>
<a id='line_838'>      senates, (so antiquity has justly styled them,) deserve to be</a>

<a id='line_840'>      republic. And yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice</a>
<a id='line_841'>      of magistrates and the venality of collectors, that many of their</a>
<a id='line_842'>      members, renouncing their dignity and their country, have taken</a>
<a id='line_843'>      refuge in distant and obscure exile.” He urges, and even compels,</a>
<a id='line_844'>      their return to their respective cities; but he removes the</a>
<a id='line_845'>      grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their</a>
<a id='line_846'>      municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of</a>
<a id='line_847'>      the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the</a>
<a id='line_848'>      tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum</a>
<a id='line_849'>      assessed on their district, they are only required to produce a</a>
<a id='line_850'>      regular account of the payments which they have actually</a>

<a id='line_853'>      bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and</a>
<a id='line_854'>      oppression which they had suffered; and he therefore revives the</a>
<a id='line_855'>      useful office of the defenders of cities. He exhorts the people</a>

<a id='line_887'>      without shame or control, were severely checked by the taste and</a>
<a id='line_888'>      spirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of the city had</a>
<a id='line_889'>      gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and</a>
<a id='line_890'>      theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the</a>
<a id='line_891'>      desires of the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of</a>

<a id='line_893'>      the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense</a>
<a id='line_894'>      space of their baths and porticos; and the stately libraries and</a>
<a id='line_895'>      halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation, whose</a>
<a id='line_896'>      repose was seldom disturbed, either by study or business. The</a>
<a id='line_897'>      monuments of consular, or Imperial, greatness were no longer</a>
<a id='line_898'>      revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were only</a>
<a id='line_899'>      esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more</a>
<a id='line_900'>      convenient than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were</a>
<a id='line_901'>      continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which</a>
<a id='line_902'>      stated the want of stones or bricks, for some necessary service:</a>
<a id='line_903'>      the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced, for the</a>
<a id='line_904'>      sake of some paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate</a>
<a id='line_905'>      Romans, who converted the spoil to their own emolument,</a>
<a id='line_906'>      demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors of their</a>
<a id='line_907'>      ancestors. Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation of</a>
<a id='line_908'>      the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil. 43 He</a>
<a id='line_909'>      reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient</a>
<a id='line_911'>      edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand</a>
<a id='line_912'>      pounds sterling) on every magistrate who should presume to grant</a>
<a id='line_913'>      such illegal and scandalous license, and threatened to chastise</a>
<a id='line_914'>      the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers, by a severe</a>
<a id='line_915'>      whipping, and the amputation of both their hands. In the last</a>
<a id='line_916'>      instance, the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of</a>
<a id='line_917'>      guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a generous</a>
<a id='line_918'>      principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of</a>
<a id='line_919'>      those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live.</a>
<a id='line_920'>      The emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the</a>
<a id='line_921'>      number of his subjects; and that it was his duty to guard the</a>
<a id='line_922'>      purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to</a>
<a id='line_923'>      accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and</a>
<a id='line_924'>      perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids, who consecrated</a>
<a id='line_925'>      their virginity to Christ, were restrained from taking the veil</a>

<a id='line_928'>      years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest</a>
<a id='line_929'>      relations, or to the state. Unequal marriages were condemned or</a>
<a id='line_930'>      annulled. The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so</a>
<a id='line_931'>      inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal</a>
<a id='line_932'>      returned to Italy, he might, by the express declaration of</a>

<a id='line_965'>      long-extended coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval</a>

<a id='line_967'>      task on the genius of Majorian. Rome expected from him alone the</a>
<a id='line_968'>      restitution of Africa; and the design, which he formed, of</a>
<a id='line_969'>      attacking the Vandals in their new settlements, was the result of</a>
<a id='line_970'>      bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor could have</a>
<a id='line_971'>      infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could have</a>
<a id='line_972'>      revived in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had</a>
<a id='line_973'>      always surpassed his equals; he might have marched against</a>
<a id='line_974'>      Genseric at the head of a Roman army. Such a reformation of</a>
<a id='line_975'>      national manners might be embraced by the rising generation; but</a>
<a id='line_976'>      it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a</a>
<a id='line_977'>      declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or</a>
<a id='line_978'>      to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance,</a>
<a id='line_979'>      and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses. Majorian, like</a>
<a id='line_980'>      the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the disgraceful</a>
<a id='line_981'>      expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place of</a>
<a id='line_982'>      his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be</a>
<a id='line_983'>      displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a</a>
<a id='line_984'>      dangerous instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it.</a>
<a id='line_985'>      Besides the confederates, who were already engaged in the service</a>
<a id='line_986'>      of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valor attracted the</a>
<a id='line_987'>      nations of the Danube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the</a>
<a id='line_988'>      Tanais. Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila, the</a>
<a id='line_989'>      Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians, the Burgundians, the Suevi,</a>
<a id='line_990'>      the Alani, assembled in the plains of Liguria; and their</a>
<a id='line_991'>      formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities. 46</a>
<a id='line_992'>      They passed the Alps in a severe winter. The emperor led the way,</a>
<a id='line_993'>      on foot, and in complete armor; sounding, with his long staff,</a>
<a id='line_994'>      the depth of the ice, or snow, and encouraging the Scythians, who</a>
<a id='line_995'>      complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance, that</a>
<a id='line_996'>      they should be satisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of</a>
<a id='line_997'>      Lyons had presumed to shut their gates; they soon implored, and</a>
<a id='line_998'>      experienced, the clemency of Majorian. He vanquished Theodoric in</a>
<a id='line_999'>      the field; and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      whom he had found not unworthy of his arms. The beneficial,</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      though precarious, reunion of the greater part of Gaul and Spain,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force; 47 and the</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      independent Bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      oppression, of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      virtues of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies;</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectionate people;</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      but the emperor had foreseen, that it was impossible, without a</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      maritime power, to achieve the conquest of Africa. In the first</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      Punic war, the republic had exerted such incredible diligence,</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      that, within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred and sixty</a>

<a id='line_1013'>      much less favorable, Majorian equalled the spirit and</a>

<a id='line_1015'>      were felled; the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      were restored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal</a>

<a id='line_1080'>      state. The king of the Vandals distrusted the valor of his native</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the South; 51 he</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him</a>

<a id='line_1091'>      sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years</a>
<a id='line_1092'>      were destroyed in a single day. 53 After this event, the behavior</a>
<a id='line_1093'>      of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune. The</a>
<a id='line_1094'>      Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory,</a>
<a id='line_1095'>      immediately renewed his solicitations for peace. The emperor of</a>
<a id='line_1096'>      the West, who was capable of forming great designs, and of</a>
<a id='line_1097'>      supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or</a>
<a id='line_1098'>      rather to a suspension of arms; in the full assurance that,</a>
<a id='line_1099'>      before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied with</a>
<a id='line_1100'>      provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to Italy,</a>

<a id='line_1166'>      It was not, perhaps, without some regret, that Ricimer sacrificed</a>

<a id='line_1169'>      virtue and merit. At his command, the obsequious senate of Rome</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus, who ascended the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      private condition. History has scarcely deigned to notice his</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      birth, his elevation, his character, or his death. Severus</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron;</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      57 and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      the vacant interval of six years, between the death of Majorian</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      and the elevation of Anthemius. During that period, the</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      government was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and, although the</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances,</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority,</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric. But his</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman generals,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      Marcellinus and Aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      an emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      divination. But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      learning, virtue, and courage; 58 the study of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      literature had improved his taste; and his military talents had</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Ætius,</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      in whose ruin he was involved. By a timely flight, Marcellinus</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      amidst the convulsions of the Western empire. His voluntary, or</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      reluctant, submission to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army,</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals;</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      but his Barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor’s death, were</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid Marcellinus</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      Adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      Africa. 59 Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome, 60 proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved</a>

<a id='line_1211'>      of the Visigoths, from marching to the gates of Rome, he</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps, and</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      rendered the name of Aegidius, respectable both in peace and war.</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of</a>

<a id='line_1263'>      of Carthage; and Genseric himself, though in a very advanced age,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      still commanded in person the most important expeditions. His</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy, till the moment</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      that he hoisted sail. When he was asked, by his pilot, what</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      course he should steer, “Leave the determination to the winds,</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance;) they will</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      the divine justice;” but if Genseric himself deigned to issue</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      criminal. The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain,</a>

<a id='line_1274'>      Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      to subdue the Island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation, or</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them,</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      distant objects, which attracted their desires; and as they</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      cavalry. Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors</a>

<a id='line_1293'>      the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric. In the</a>

<a id='line_1398'>      conscious of his duty and of his prerogative. Aspar was</a>

<a id='line_1552'>      crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once been the</a>

<a id='line_1557'>      origin had preceded the foundation of Rome, was still celebrated</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      under the reign of Anthemius. The savage and simple rites were</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      expressive of an early state of society before the invention of</a>

<a id='line_1563'>      create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      limited, and whose malice was inoffensive. A goat was the</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      offering the best adapted to their character and attributes; the</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about the fields,</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      with leather thongs in their hands, communicating, as it was</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      supposed, the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they</a>

<a id='line_1647'>      the Vandals; and Genseric, who had so long oppressed both the</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      land and sea, was threatened from every side with a formidable</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      invasion. The campaign was opened by a bold and successful</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      enterprise of the præfect Heraclius. 84 The troops of Egypt,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      Thebais, and Libya, were embarked, under his command; and the</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      Arabs, with a train of horses and camels, opened the roads of the</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      desert. Heraclius landed on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and</a>

<a id='line_1655'>      march, which Cato had formerly executed, 85 to join the Imperial</a>

<a id='line_1662'>      to Rome; the Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      Italy; the active valor of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from</a>

<a id='line_1673'>      were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does</a>

<a id='line_1754'>      extinguished. Genseric beheld the danger with firmness, and</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      eluded it with his veteran dexterity. He protested, in the most</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      respectful language, that he was ready to submit his person, and</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he requested a</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission; and</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      it was universally believed, that his secret liberality</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      contributed to the success of this public negotiation. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus consented to</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      During this short interval, the wind became favorable to the</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      designs of Genseric. He manned his largest ships of war with the</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      bravest of the Moors and Vandals; and they towed after them many</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      large barks, filled with combustible materials. In the obscurity</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      by the sense of their instant danger. Their close and crowded</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind,</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the soldiers</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased the</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilst they labored to extricate</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      the navy, the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      and disciplined valor; and many of the Romans, who escaped the</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      Vandals. Among the events of that disastrous night, the heroic,</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      or rather desperate, courage of John, one of the principal</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from oblivion. When</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost consumed, he</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      threw himself in his armor into the sea, disdainfully rejected</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      him to accept honorable quarter, and sunk under the waves;</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      exclaiming, with his last breath, that he would never fall alive</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      into the hands of those impious dogs. Actuated by a far different</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      spirit, Basiliscus, whose station was the most remote from</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement,</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      returned to Constantinople with the loss of more than half of his</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      St. Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. Heraclius effected</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      his retreat through the desert; Marcellinus retired to Sicily,</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer,</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves should</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. 89 After</a>

<a id='line_1854'>      checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the Visigoths.</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived,</a>

<a id='line_1858'>      brother Theodoric, and displayed, with a more savage temper,</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      superior abilities, both in peace and war. He passed the Pyrenees</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      at the head of a numerous army, subdued the cities of Saragossa</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      and Pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      Tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into the heart</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      of Lusitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain. 92 The efforts of</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      Euric were not less vigorous, or less successful, in Gaul; and</a>

<a id='line_1876'>      attacked the Gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of</a>

<a id='line_1943'>      he obtained within the term of five years, abolished the merit</a>

<a id='line_1953'>      Proefectorian rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      Flavius Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      in the Capitol. 98 He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      four deputies of Gaul, who were all distinguished by their birth,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      their dignities, or their eloquence. In the name of a great</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      province, and according to the forms of Roman jurisprudence, they</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      instituted a civil and criminal action, requiring such</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals, and</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state. Their</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty; but they</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      secretary, to have been dictated by Arvandus himself. The author</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      peace with the Greek emperor: he suggested the attack of the</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      Britons on the Loire; and he recommended a division of Gaul,</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      according to the law of nations, between the Visigoths and the</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      Burgundians. 99 These pernicious schemes, which a friend could</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      till the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately apprised</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      without any mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      Arvandus, who rejected, and even resented, the salutary advice of</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      his friends. Ignorant of his real situation, Arvandus showed</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      himself in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate, accepted</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      indiscriminate salutations and offers of service, examined the</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with the</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      indifference of a spectator, and sometimes with the attention of</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      prince, and of the delays of justice. His complaints were soon</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      removed. An early day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      appeared, with his accusers, before a numerous assembly of the</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      Roman senate. The mournful garb which they affected, excited the</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      compassion of the judges, who were scandalized by the gay and</a>

<a id='line_1995'>      memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old</a>

<a id='line_1998'>      audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the strange</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      supposition, that a subject could not be convicted of treason,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple. As the</a>

<a id='line_2003'>      acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      was equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      declared him guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      degraded from the rank of a præfect to the obscure condition of</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      a plebeian, and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      public prison. After a fortnight’s adjournment, the senate was</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death; but while</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      he expected, in the Island of Aesculapius, the expiration of the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors,</a>

<a id='line_2013'>      the præfect of Gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      confiscation. The faults of Arvandus might deserve compassion;</a>

<a id='line_2075'>      delay to Rome, where he was received with the honors due to his</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favor of peace</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      may be easily supposed; he argued, that, in all possible</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      mercy, or magnanimity, or prudence; and he seriously admonished</a>

<a id='line_2081'>      might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions.</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      felt, with grief and indignation, the behavior of Ricimer, and</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse. “What</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      favors,” he warmly exclaimed, “have we refused to this ungrateful</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      man? What provocations have we not endured! Regardless of the</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      majesty of the purple, I gave my daughter to a Goth; I sacrificed</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      my own blood to the safety of the republic. The liberality which</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      ought to have secured the eternal attachment of Ricimer has</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      exasperated him against his benefactor. What wars has he not</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      excited against the empire! How often has he instigated and</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      assisted the fury of hostile nations! Shall I now accept his</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      perfidious friendship? Can I hope that he will respect the</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      son?” But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      exclamations: he insensibly yielded to the proposals of</a>

<a id='line_2327'>      Orestes, 118 the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last</a>
<a id='line_2328'>      Roman emperor of the West. Orestes, who has been already</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      mentioned in this History, had never deserted his country. His</a>
<a id='line_2330'>      birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious</a>

<a id='line_2332'>      he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person, and</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      signify the commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      conqueror restored him to his freedom; and Orestes might</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      honorably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had usurped the</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the service of the Italian</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      princes, the successors of Valentinian; and as he possessed the</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      elevated, by the favor of Nepos himself, to the dignities of</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      patrician, and master-general of the troops. These troops had</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      Orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      own language, and was intimately connected with their national</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendship. At his</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek, who</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes, from some</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      facility, to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      West. By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      summit of his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      end of the first year, that the lessons of perjury and</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      ingratitude, which a rebel must inculcate, will be resorted to</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      against himself; and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      only permitted to choose, whether he would be the slave, or the</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous alliance of</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution, their pay and</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a</a>
<a id='line_2363'>      still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their</a>
<a id='line_2364'>      brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had</a>
<a id='line_2365'>      acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance; and they</a>
<a id='line_2366'>      insisted on their peremptory demand, that a third part of the</a>
<a id='line_2367'>      lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them. Orestes,</a>
<a id='line_2368'>      with a spirit, which, in another situation, might be entitled to</a>
<a id='line_2369'>      our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed</a>
<a id='line_2370'>      multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. He</a>
<a id='line_2371'>      rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to</a>
<a id='line_2372'>      the ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his</a>
<a id='line_2373'>      fellow-soldiers, that, if they dared to associate under his</a>
<a id='line_2374'>      command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied</a>
<a id='line_2375'>      to their dutiful petitions. From all the camps and garrisons of</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      Italy, the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia, the</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged;</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      and although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      success, to save the property of the church, and the chastity of</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      female captives, the tumult could only be appeased by the</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      execution of Orestes. 119 His brother Paul was slain in an action</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      near Ravenna; and the helpless Augustulus, who could no longer</a>

<a id='line_2545'>      appellations of the two great founders, of the city and of the</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last of their</a>

<a id='line_2549'>      Momyllus, by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the</a>

<a id='line_2551'>      this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from the</a>
<a id='line_2553'>      Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance at six thousand</a>
<a id='line_2554'>      pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in Campania,</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      for the place of his exile or retirement. 127 As soon as the</a>

<a id='line_2557'>      attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the</a>

<a id='line_2562'>      promontory of Misenum, that commands, on every side, the sea and</a>
<a id='line_2563'>      land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon. 129 The villa of</a>
<a id='line_2564'>      Marius was purchased, within a few years, by Lucullus, and the</a>
<a id='line_2565'>      price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to more than</a>

<a id='line_2667'>      Italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and</a>
<a id='line_2668'>      fortune had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the</a>

<a id='line_2670'>      a Barbarian, the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his</a>
<a id='line_2671'>      subjects. After an interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the</a>
<a id='line_2672'>      consulship of the West. For himself, he modestly, or proudly,</a>
<a id='line_2673'>      declined an honor which was still accepted by the emperors of the</a>
<a id='line_2674'>      East; but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of</a>
<a id='line_2675'>      the most illustrious senators; 133 and the list is adorned by the</a>
<a id='line_2676'>      respectable name of Basilius, whose virtues claimed the</a>
<a id='line_2677'>      friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his client. 134 The</a>
<a id='line_2678'>      laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the civil</a>
<a id='line_2679'>      administration of Italy was still exercised by the Prætorian</a>
<a id='line_2680'>      præfect and his subordinate officers. Odoacer devolved on the</a>
<a id='line_2681'>      Roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting</a>
<a id='line_2682'>      the public revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of</a>

<a id='line_2684'>      Barbarians, he had been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he</a>
<a id='line_2685'>      revered the monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of</a>
<a id='line_2686'>      the Catholics attest the toleration which they enjoyed. The peace</a>
<a id='line_2687'>      of the city required the interposition of his præfect Basilius</a>
<a id='line_2688'>      in the choice of a Roman pontiff: the decree which restrained the</a>
<a id='line_2689'>      clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for</a>
<a id='line_2690'>      the benefit of the people, whose devotions would have been taxed</a>

<a id='line_2756'>      aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was</a>
<a id='line_2757'>      imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands</a>

<a id='line_2769'>      licentious and turbulent multitude. The kings of the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_2770'>      were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered, by their native</a>
