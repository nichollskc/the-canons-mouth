<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>  These to His Memory--since he held them dear,</a>
<a id='line_47'>  Perchance as finding there unconsciously</a>
<a id='line_48'>  Some image of himself--I dedicate,</a>
<a id='line_49'>  I dedicate, I consecrate with tears--</a>
<a id='line_50'>  These Idylls.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>               And indeed He seems to me</a>
<a id='line_53'>  Scarce other than my king's ideal knight,</a>
<a id='line_54'>  'Who reverenced his conscience as his king;</a>
<a id='line_55'>  Whose glory was, redressing human wrong;</a>
<a id='line_56'>  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it;</a>
<a id='line_57'>  Who loved one only and who clave to her--'</a>
<a id='line_58'>  Her--over all whose realms to their last isle,</a>
<a id='line_59'>  Commingled with the gloom of imminent war,</a>
<a id='line_60'>  The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse,</a>
<a id='line_61'>  Darkening the world.  We have lost him:  he is gone:</a>
<a id='line_62'>  We know him now:  all narrow jealousies</a>
<a id='line_63'>  Are silent; and we see him as he moved,</a>
<a id='line_64'>  How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,</a>
<a id='line_65'>  With what sublime repression of himself,</a>
<a id='line_66'>  And in what limits, and how tenderly;</a>
<a id='line_67'>  Not swaying to this faction or to that;</a>
<a id='line_68'>  Not making his high place the lawless perch</a>
<a id='line_69'>  Of winged ambitions, nor a vantage-ground</a>
<a id='line_70'>  For pleasure; but through all this tract of years</a>
<a id='line_71'>  Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,</a>
<a id='line_72'>  Before a thousand peering littlenesses,</a>
<a id='line_73'>  In that fierce light which beats upon a throne,</a>
<a id='line_74'>  And blackens every blot:  for where is he,</a>
<a id='line_75'>  Who dares foreshadow for an only son</a>
<a id='line_76'>  A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his?</a>
<a id='line_77'>  Or how should England dreaming of his sons</a>
<a id='line_78'>  Hope more for these than some inheritance</a>
<a id='line_79'>  Of such a life, a heart, a mind as thine,</a>
<a id='line_80'>  Thou noble Father of her Kings to be,</a>
<a id='line_81'>  Laborious for her people and her poor--</a>
<a id='line_82'>  Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day--</a>
<a id='line_83'>  Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste</a>
<a id='line_84'>  To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace--</a>
<a id='line_85'>  Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam</a>
<a id='line_86'>  Of letters, dear to Science, dear to Art,</a>
<a id='line_87'>  Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,</a>
<a id='line_88'>  Beyond all titles, and a household name,</a>
<a id='line_89'>  Hereafter, through all times, Albert the Good.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>     Break not, O woman's-heart, but still endure;</a>
<a id='line_92'>  Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,</a>
<a id='line_93'>  Remembering all the beauty of that star</a>
<a id='line_94'>  Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made</a>
<a id='line_95'>  One light together, but has past and leaves</a>
<a id='line_96'>  The Crown a lonely splendour.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>                               May all love,</a>
<a id='line_99'>  His love, unseen but felt, o'ershadow Thee,</a>
<a id='line_100'>  The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee,</a>
<a id='line_101'>  The love of all Thy daughters cherish Thee,</a>
<a id='line_102'>  The love of all Thy people comfort Thee,</a>
<a id='line_103'>  Till God's love set Thee at his side again!</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>  The Coming of Arthur</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>  Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,</a>
<a id='line_110'>  Had one fair daughter, and none other child;</a>
<a id='line_111'>  And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth,</a>
<a id='line_112'>  Guinevere, and in her his one delight.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>     For many a petty king ere Arthur came</a>
<a id='line_115'>  Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war</a>
<a id='line_116'>  Each upon other, wasted all the land;</a>
<a id='line_117'>  And still from time to time the heathen host</a>
<a id='line_118'>  Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.</a>
<a id='line_119'>  And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_120'>  Wherein the beast was ever more and more,</a>
<a id='line_121'>  But man was less and less, till Arthur came.</a>
<a id='line_122'>  For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,</a>
<a id='line_123'>  And after him King Uther fought and died,</a>
<a id='line_124'>  But either failed to make the kingdom one.</a>
<a id='line_125'>  And after these King Arthur for a space,</a>
<a id='line_126'>  And through the puissance of his Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_127'>  Drew all their petty princedoms under him.</a>
<a id='line_128'>  Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>     And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,</a>
<a id='line_131'>  Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,</a>
<a id='line_132'>  And none or few to scare or chase the beast;</a>
<a id='line_133'>  So that wild dog, and wolf and boar and bear</a>
<a id='line_134'>  Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,</a>
<a id='line_135'>  And wallowed in the gardens of the King.</a>
<a id='line_136'>  And ever and anon the wolf would steal</a>
<a id='line_137'>  The children and devour, but now and then,</a>
<a id='line_138'>  Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat</a>
<a id='line_139'>  To human sucklings; and the children, housed</a>
<a id='line_140'>  In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,</a>
<a id='line_141'>  And mock their foster mother on four feet,</a>
<a id='line_142'>  Till, straightened, they grew up to wolf-like men,</a>
<a id='line_143'>  Worse than the wolves.  And King Leodogran</a>
<a id='line_144'>  Groaned for the Roman legions here again,</a>
<a id='line_145'>  And Caesar's eagle:  then his brother king,</a>
<a id='line_146'>  Urien, assailed him:  last a heathen horde,</a>
<a id='line_147'>  Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,</a>
<a id='line_148'>  And on the spike that split the mother's heart</a>
<a id='line_149'>  Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,</a>
<a id='line_150'>  He knew not whither he should turn for aid.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>     But--for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,</a>
<a id='line_153'>  Though not without an uproar made by those</a>
<a id='line_154'>  Who cried, 'He is not Uther's son'--the King</a>
<a id='line_155'>  Sent to him, saying, 'Arise, and help us thou!</a>
<a id='line_156'>  For here between the man and beast we die.'</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>     And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,</a>
<a id='line_159'>  But heard the call, and came:  and Guinevere</a>
<a id='line_160'>  Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;</a>
<a id='line_161'>  But since he neither wore on helm or shield</a>
<a id='line_162'>  The golden symbol of his kinglihood,</a>
<a id='line_163'>  But rode a simple knight among his knights,</a>
<a id='line_164'>  And many of these in richer arms than he,</a>
<a id='line_165'>  She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,</a>
<a id='line_166'>  One among many, though his face was bare.</a>
<a id='line_167'>  But Arthur, looking downward as he past,</a>
<a id='line_168'>  Felt the light of her eyes into his life</a>
<a id='line_169'>  Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched</a>
<a id='line_170'>  His tents beside the forest.  Then he drave</a>
<a id='line_171'>  The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled</a>
<a id='line_172'>  The forest, letting in the sun, and made</a>
<a id='line_173'>  Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight</a>
<a id='line_174'>  And so returned.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>                  For while he lingered there,</a>
<a id='line_177'>  A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts</a>
<a id='line_178'>  Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm</a>
<a id='line_179'>  Flashed forth and into war:  for most of these,</a>
<a id='line_180'>  Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,</a>
<a id='line_181'>  Made head against him, crying, 'Who is he</a>
<a id='line_182'>  That he should rule us? who hath proven him</a>
<a id='line_183'>  King Uther's son? for lo! we look at him,</a>
<a id='line_184'>  And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,</a>
<a id='line_185'>  Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.</a>
<a id='line_186'>  This is the son of Gorlois, not the King;</a>
<a id='line_187'>  This is the son of Anton, not the King.'</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>     And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt</a>
<a id='line_190'>  Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,</a>
<a id='line_191'>  Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;</a>
<a id='line_192'>  And thinking as he rode, 'Her father said</a>
<a id='line_193'>  That there between the man and beast they die.</a>
<a id='line_194'>  Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts</a>
<a id='line_195'>  Up to my throne, and side by side with me?</a>
<a id='line_196'>  What happiness to reign a lonely king,</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Vext--O ye stars that shudder over me,</a>
<a id='line_198'>  O earth that soundest hollow under me,</a>
<a id='line_199'>  Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined</a>
<a id='line_200'>  To her that is the fairest under heaven,</a>
<a id='line_201'>  I seem as nothing in the mighty world,</a>
<a id='line_202'>  And cannot will my will, nor work my work</a>
<a id='line_203'>  Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm</a>
<a id='line_204'>  Victor and lord.  But were I joined with her,</a>
<a id='line_205'>  Then might we live together as one life,</a>
<a id='line_206'>  And reigning with one will in everything</a>
<a id='line_207'>  Have power on this dark land to lighten it,</a>
<a id='line_208'>  And power on this dead world to make it live.'</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>     Thereafter--as he speaks who tells the tale--</a>
<a id='line_211'>  When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright</a>
<a id='line_212'>  With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world</a>
<a id='line_213'>  Was all so clear about him, that he saw</a>
<a id='line_214'>  The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,</a>
<a id='line_215'>  And even in high day the morning star.</a>
<a id='line_216'>  So when the King had set his banner broad,</a>
<a id='line_217'>  At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,</a>
<a id='line_218'>  And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,</a>
<a id='line_219'>  The long-lanced battle let their horses run.</a>
<a id='line_220'>  And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,</a>
<a id='line_221'>  And now the King, as here and there that war</a>
<a id='line_222'>  Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world</a>
<a id='line_223'>  Made lightnings and great thunders over him,</a>
<a id='line_224'>  And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,</a>
<a id='line_225'>  And mightier of his hands with every blow,</a>
<a id='line_226'>  And leading all his knighthood threw the kings</a>
<a id='line_227'>  Carados, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,</a>
<a id='line_228'>  Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,</a>
<a id='line_229'>  The King Brandagoras of Latangor,</a>
<a id='line_230'>  With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,</a>
<a id='line_231'>  And Lot of Orkney.  Then, before a voice</a>
<a id='line_232'>  As dreadful as the shout of one who sees</a>
<a id='line_233'>  To one who sins, and deems himself alone</a>
<a id='line_234'>  And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake</a>
<a id='line_235'>  Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands</a>
<a id='line_236'>  That hacked among the flyers, 'Ho! they yield!'</a>
<a id='line_237'>  So like a painted battle the war stood</a>
<a id='line_238'>  Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,</a>
<a id='line_239'>  And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.</a>
<a id='line_240'>  He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved</a>
<a id='line_241'>  And honoured most.  'Thou dost not doubt me King,</a>
<a id='line_242'>  So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.'</a>
<a id='line_243'>  'Sir and my liege,' he cried, 'the fire of God</a>
<a id='line_244'>  Descends upon thee in the battle-field:</a>
<a id='line_245'>  I know thee for my King!'  Whereat the two,</a>
<a id='line_246'>  For each had warded either in the fight,</a>
<a id='line_247'>  Sware on the field of death a deathless love.</a>
<a id='line_248'>  And Arthur said, 'Man's word is God in man:</a>
<a id='line_249'>  Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.'</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>     Then quickly from the foughten field he sent</a>
<a id='line_252'>  Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,</a>
<a id='line_253'>  His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,</a>
<a id='line_254'>  Saying, 'If I in aught have served thee well,</a>
<a id='line_255'>  Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.'</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>     Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart</a>
<a id='line_258'>  Debating--'How should I that am a king,</a>
<a id='line_259'>  However much he holp me at my need,</a>
<a id='line_260'>  Give my one daughter saving to a king,</a>
<a id='line_261'>  And a king's son?'--lifted his voice, and called</a>
<a id='line_262'>  A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom</a>
<a id='line_263'>  He trusted all things, and of him required</a>
<a id='line_264'>  His counsel:  'Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?'</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>     Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,</a>
<a id='line_267'>  'Sir King, there be but two old men that know:</a>
<a id='line_268'>  And each is twice as old as I; and one</a>
<a id='line_269'>  Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served</a>
<a id='line_270'>  King Uther through his magic art; and one</a>
<a id='line_271'>  Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,</a>
<a id='line_272'>  Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran</a>
<a id='line_273'>  Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,</a>
<a id='line_274'>  Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote</a>
<a id='line_275'>  All things and whatsoever Merlin did</a>
<a id='line_276'>  In one great annal-book, where after-years</a>
<a id='line_277'>  Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.'</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>     To whom the King Leodogran replied,</a>
<a id='line_280'>  'O friend, had I been holpen half as well</a>
<a id='line_281'>  By this King Arthur as by thee today,</a>
<a id='line_282'>  Then beast and man had had their share of me:</a>
<a id='line_283'>  But summon here before us yet once more</a>
<a id='line_284'>  Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.'</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>     Then, when they came before him, the King said,</a>
<a id='line_287'>  'I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,</a>
<a id='line_288'>  And reason in the chase:  but wherefore now</a>
<a id='line_289'>  Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,</a>
<a id='line_290'>  Some calling Arthur born of Gorlois,</a>
<a id='line_291'>  Others of Anton?  Tell me, ye yourselves,</a>
<a id='line_292'>  Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?'</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>     And Ulfius and Brastias answered, 'Ay.'</a>
<a id='line_295'>  Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights</a>
<a id='line_296'>  Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake--</a>
<a id='line_297'>  For bold in heart and act and word was he,</a>
<a id='line_298'>  Whenever slander breathed against the King--</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>     'Sir, there be many rumours on this head:</a>
<a id='line_301'>  For there be those who hate him in their hearts,</a>
<a id='line_302'>  Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,</a>
<a id='line_303'>  And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:</a>
<a id='line_304'>  And there be those who deem him more than man,</a>
<a id='line_305'>  And dream he dropt from heaven:  but my belief</a>
<a id='line_306'>  In all this matter--so ye care to learn--</a>
<a id='line_307'>  Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time</a>
<a id='line_308'>  The prince and warrior Gorlois, he that held</a>
<a id='line_309'>  Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,</a>
<a id='line_310'>  Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:</a>
<a id='line_311'>  And daughters had she borne him,--one whereof,</a>
<a id='line_312'>  Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,</a>
<a id='line_313'>  Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved</a>
<a id='line_314'>  To Arthur,--but a son she had not borne.</a>
<a id='line_315'>  And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:</a>
<a id='line_316'>  But she, a stainless wife to Gorlois,</a>
<a id='line_317'>  So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,</a>
<a id='line_318'>  That Gorlois and King Uther went to war:</a>
<a id='line_319'>  And overthrown was Gorlois and slain.</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged</a>
<a id='line_321'>  Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,</a>
<a id='line_322'>  Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,</a>
<a id='line_323'>  Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,</a>
<a id='line_324'>  And there was none to call to but himself.</a>
<a id='line_325'>  So, compassed by the power of the King,</a>
<a id='line_326'>  Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,</a>
<a id='line_327'>  And with a shameful swiftness:  afterward,</a>
<a id='line_328'>  Not many moons, King Uther died himself,</a>
<a id='line_329'>  Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule</a>
<a id='line_330'>  After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.</a>
<a id='line_331'>  And that same night, the night of the new year,</a>
<a id='line_332'>  By reason of the bitterness and grief</a>
<a id='line_333'>  That vext his mother, all before his time</a>
<a id='line_334'>  Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born</a>
<a id='line_335'>  Delivered at a secret postern-gate</a>
<a id='line_336'>  To Merlin, to be holden far apart</a>
<a id='line_337'>  Until his hour should come; because the lords</a>
<a id='line_338'>  Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,</a>
<a id='line_339'>  Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child</a>
<a id='line_340'>  Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each</a>
<a id='line_341'>  But sought to rule for his own self and hand,</a>
<a id='line_342'>  And many hated Uther for the sake</a>
<a id='line_343'>  Of Gorlois.  Wherefore Merlin took the child,</a>
<a id='line_344'>  And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight</a>
<a id='line_345'>  And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife</a>
<a id='line_346'>  Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;</a>
<a id='line_347'>  And no man knew.  And ever since the lords</a>
<a id='line_348'>  Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_349'>  So that the realm has gone to wrack:  but now,</a>
<a id='line_350'>  This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)</a>
<a id='line_351'>  Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,</a>
<a id='line_352'>  Proclaiming, "Here is Uther's heir, your king,"</a>
<a id='line_353'>  A hundred voices cried, "Away with him!</a>
<a id='line_354'>  No king of ours! a son of Gorlois he,</a>
<a id='line_355'>  Or else the child of Anton, and no king,</a>
<a id='line_356'>  Or else baseborn."  Yet Merlin through his craft,</a>
<a id='line_357'>  And while the people clamoured for a king,</a>
<a id='line_358'>  Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords</a>
<a id='line_359'>  Banded, and so brake out in open war.'</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>     Then while the King debated with himself</a>
<a id='line_362'>  If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,</a>
<a id='line_363'>  Or born the son of Gorlois, after death,</a>
<a id='line_364'>  Or Uther's son, and born before his time,</a>
<a id='line_365'>  Or whether there were truth in anything</a>
<a id='line_366'>  Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,</a>
<a id='line_367'>  With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,</a>
<a id='line_368'>  Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;</a>
<a id='line_369'>  Whom as he could, not as he would, the King</a>
<a id='line_370'>  Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat,</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>     'A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.</a>
<a id='line_373'>  Ye come from Arthur's court.  Victor his men</a>
<a id='line_374'>  Report him!  Yea, but ye--think ye this king--</a>
<a id='line_375'>  So many those that hate him, and so strong,</a>
<a id='line_376'>  So few his knights, however brave they be--</a>
<a id='line_377'>  Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?'</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>     'O King,' she cried, 'and I will tell thee:  few,</a>
<a id='line_380'>  Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;</a>
<a id='line_381'>  For I was near him when the savage yells</a>
<a id='line_382'>  Of Uther's peerage died, and Arthur sat</a>
<a id='line_383'>  Crowned on the dais, and his warriors cried,</a>
<a id='line_384'>  "Be thou the king, and we will work thy will</a>
<a id='line_385'>  Who love thee."  Then the King in low deep tones,</a>
<a id='line_386'>  And simple words of great authority,</a>
<a id='line_387'>  Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,</a>
<a id='line_388'>  That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some</a>
<a id='line_389'>  Were pale as at the passing of a ghost,</a>
<a id='line_390'>  Some flushed, and others dazed, as one who wakes</a>
<a id='line_391'>  Half-blinded at the coming of a light.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>     'But when he spake and cheered his Table Round</a>
<a id='line_394'>  With large, divine, and comfortable words,</a>
<a id='line_395'>  Beyond my tongue to tell thee--I beheld</a>
<a id='line_396'>  From eye to eye through all their Order flash</a>
<a id='line_397'>  A momentary likeness of the King:</a>
<a id='line_398'>  And ere it left their faces, through the cross</a>
<a id='line_399'>  And those around it and the Crucified,</a>
<a id='line_400'>  Down from the casement over Arthur, smote</a>
<a id='line_401'>  Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays,</a>
<a id='line_402'>  One falling upon each of three fair queens,</a>
<a id='line_403'>  Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends</a>
<a id='line_404'>  Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright</a>
<a id='line_405'>  Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>     'And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit</a>
<a id='line_408'>  And hundred winters are but as the hands</a>
<a id='line_409'>  Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>     'And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,</a>
<a id='line_412'>  Who knows a subtler magic than his own--</a>
<a id='line_413'>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.</a>
<a id='line_414'>  She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,</a>
<a id='line_415'>  Whereby to drive the heathen out:  a mist</a>
<a id='line_416'>  Of incense curled about her, and her face</a>
<a id='line_417'>  Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;</a>
<a id='line_418'>  But there was heard among the holy hymns</a>
<a id='line_419'>  A voice as of the waters, for she dwells</a>
<a id='line_420'>  Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms</a>
<a id='line_421'>  May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,</a>
<a id='line_422'>  Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_423'></a>
<a id='line_424'>     'There likewise I beheld Excalibur</a>
<a id='line_425'>  Before him at his crowning borne, the sword</a>
<a id='line_426'>  That rose from out the bosom of the lake,</a>
<a id='line_427'>  And Arthur rowed across and took it--rich</a>
<a id='line_428'>  With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,</a>
<a id='line_429'>  Bewildering heart and eye--the blade so bright</a>
<a id='line_430'>  That men are blinded by it--on one side,</a>
<a id='line_431'>  Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,</a>
<a id='line_432'>  "Take me," but turn the blade and ye shall see,</a>
<a id='line_433'>  And written in the speech ye speak yourself,</a>
<a id='line_434'>  "Cast me away!"  And sad was Arthur's face</a>
<a id='line_435'>  Taking it, but old Merlin counselled him,</a>
<a id='line_436'>  "Take thou and strike! the time to cast away</a>
<a id='line_437'>  Is yet far-off."  So this great brand the king</a>
<a id='line_438'>  Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.'</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>     Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought</a>
<a id='line_441'>  To sift his doubtings to the last, and asked,</a>
<a id='line_442'>  Fixing full eyes of question on her face,</a>
<a id='line_443'>  'The swallow and the swift are near akin,</a>
<a id='line_444'>  But thou art closer to this noble prince,</a>
<a id='line_445'>  Being his own dear sister;' and she said,</a>
<a id='line_446'>  'Daughter of Gorlois and Ygerne am I;'</a>
<a id='line_447'>  'And therefore Arthur's sister?' asked the King.</a>
<a id='line_448'>  She answered, 'These be secret things,' and signed</a>
<a id='line_449'>  To those two sons to pass, and let them be.</a>
<a id='line_450'>  And Gawain went, and breaking into song</a>
<a id='line_451'>  Sprang out, and followed by his flying hair</a>
<a id='line_452'>  Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:</a>
<a id='line_453'>  But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,</a>
<a id='line_454'>  And there half-heard; the same that afterward</a>
<a id='line_455'>  Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.</a>
<a id='line_456'></a>
<a id='line_457'>     And then the Queen made answer, 'What know I?</a>
<a id='line_458'>  For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,</a>
<a id='line_459'>  And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark</a>
<a id='line_460'>  Was Gorlois, yea and dark was Uther too,</a>
<a id='line_461'>  Wellnigh to blackness; but this King is fair</a>
<a id='line_462'>  Beyond the race of Britons and of men.</a>
<a id='line_463'>  Moreover, always in my mind I hear</a>
<a id='line_464'>  A cry from out the dawning of my life,</a>
<a id='line_465'>  A mother weeping, and I hear her say,</a>
<a id='line_466'>  "O that ye had some brother, pretty one,</a>
<a id='line_467'>  To guard thee on the rough ways of the world."'</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>     'Ay,' said the King, 'and hear ye such a cry?</a>
<a id='line_470'>  But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?'</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>     'O King!' she cried, 'and I will tell thee true:</a>
<a id='line_473'>  He found me first when yet a little maid:</a>
<a id='line_474'>  Beaten I had been for a little fault</a>
<a id='line_475'>  Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran</a>
<a id='line_476'>  And flung myself down on a bank of heath,</a>
<a id='line_477'>  And hated this fair world and all therein,</a>
<a id='line_478'>  And wept, and wished that I were dead; and he--</a>
<a id='line_479'>  I know not whether of himself he came,</a>
<a id='line_480'>  Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk</a>
<a id='line_481'>  Unseen at pleasure--he was at my side,</a>
<a id='line_482'>  And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,</a>
<a id='line_483'>  And dried my tears, being a child with me.</a>
<a id='line_484'>  And many a time he came, and evermore</a>
<a id='line_485'>  As I grew greater grew with me; and sad</a>
<a id='line_486'>  At times he seemed, and sad with him was I,</a>
<a id='line_487'>  Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,</a>
<a id='line_488'>  But sweet again, and then I loved him well.</a>
<a id='line_489'>  And now of late I see him less and less,</a>
<a id='line_490'>  But those first days had golden hours for me,</a>
<a id='line_491'>  For then I surely thought he would be king.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>     'But let me tell thee now another tale:</a>
<a id='line_494'>  For Bleys, our Merlin's master, as they say,</a>
<a id='line_495'>  Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,</a>
<a id='line_496'>  To hear him speak before he left his life.</a>
<a id='line_497'>  Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;</a>
<a id='line_498'>  And when I entered told me that himself</a>
<a id='line_499'>  And Merlin ever served about the King,</a>
<a id='line_500'>  Uther, before he died; and on the night</a>
<a id='line_501'>  When Uther in Tintagil past away</a>
<a id='line_502'>  Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two</a>
<a id='line_503'>  Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,</a>
<a id='line_504'>  Then from the castle gateway by the chasm</a>
<a id='line_505'>  Descending through the dismal night--a night</a>
<a id='line_506'>  In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost--</a>
<a id='line_507'>  Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps</a>
<a id='line_508'>  It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof</a>
<a id='line_509'>  A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern</a>
<a id='line_510'>  Bright with a shining people on the decks,</a>
<a id='line_511'>  And gone as soon as seen.  And then the two</a>
<a id='line_512'>  Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,</a>
<a id='line_513'>  Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,</a>
<a id='line_514'>  Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep</a>
<a id='line_515'>  And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged</a>
<a id='line_516'>  Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:</a>
<a id='line_517'>  And down the wave and in the flame was borne</a>
<a id='line_518'>  A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,</a>
<a id='line_519'>  Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried "The King!</a>
<a id='line_520'>  Here is an heir for Uther!"  And the fringe</a>
<a id='line_521'>  Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,</a>
<a id='line_522'>  Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,</a>
<a id='line_523'>  And all at once all round him rose in fire,</a>
<a id='line_524'>  So that the child and he were clothed in fire.</a>
<a id='line_525'>  And presently thereafter followed calm,</a>
<a id='line_526'>  Free sky and stars:  "And this the same child," he said,</a>
<a id='line_527'>  "Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace</a>
<a id='line_528'>  Till this were told."  And saying this the seer</a>
<a id='line_529'>  Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,</a>
<a id='line_530'>  Not ever to be questioned any more</a>
<a id='line_531'>  Save on the further side; but when I met</a>
<a id='line_532'>  Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth--</a>
<a id='line_533'>  The shining dragon and the naked child</a>
<a id='line_534'>  Descending in the glory of the seas--</a>
<a id='line_535'>  He laughed as is his wont, and answered me</a>
<a id='line_536'>  In riddling triplets of old time, and said:</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>     '"Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!</a>
<a id='line_539'>  A young man will be wiser by and by;</a>
<a id='line_540'>  An old man's wit may wander ere he die.</a>
<a id='line_541'>     Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!</a>
<a id='line_542'>  And truth is this to me, and that to thee;</a>
<a id='line_543'>  And truth or clothed or naked let it be.</a>
<a id='line_544'>     Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows:</a>
<a id='line_545'>  Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?</a>
<a id='line_546'>  From the great deep to the great deep he goes."</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>     'So Merlin riddling angered me; but thou</a>
<a id='line_549'>  Fear not to give this King thy only child,</a>
<a id='line_550'>  Guinevere:  so great bards of him will sing</a>
<a id='line_551'>  Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old</a>
<a id='line_552'>  Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,</a>
<a id='line_553'>  And echoed by old folk beside their fires</a>
<a id='line_554'>  For comfort after their wage-work is done,</a>
<a id='line_555'>  Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time</a>
<a id='line_556'>  Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn</a>
<a id='line_557'>  Though men may wound him that he will not die,</a>
<a id='line_558'>  But pass, again to come; and then or now</a>
<a id='line_559'>  Utterly smite the heathen underfoot,</a>
<a id='line_560'>  Till these and all men hail him for their king.'</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>     She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,</a>
<a id='line_563'>  But musing, 'Shall I answer yea or nay?'</a>
<a id='line_564'>  Doubted, and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,</a>
<a id='line_565'>  Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,</a>
<a id='line_566'>  Field after field, up to a height, the peak</a>
<a id='line_567'>  Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,</a>
<a id='line_568'>  Now looming, and now lost; and on the slope</a>
<a id='line_569'>  The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,</a>
<a id='line_570'>  Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,</a>
<a id='line_571'>  In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,</a>
<a id='line_572'>  Streamed to the peak, and mingled with the haze</a>
<a id='line_573'>  And made it thicker; while the phantom king</a>
<a id='line_574'>  Sent out at times a voice; and here or there</a>
<a id='line_575'>  Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest</a>
<a id='line_576'>  Slew on and burnt, crying, 'No king of ours,</a>
<a id='line_577'>  No son of Uther, and no king of ours;'</a>
<a id='line_578'>  Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze</a>
<a id='line_579'>  Descended, and the solid earth became</a>
<a id='line_580'>  As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_581'>  Crowned.  And Leodogran awoke, and sent</a>
<a id='line_582'>  Ulfius, and Brastias and Bedivere,</a>
<a id='line_583'>  Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.</a>
<a id='line_584'></a>
<a id='line_585'>     Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved</a>
<a id='line_586'>  And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth</a>
<a id='line_587'>  And bring the Queen;--and watched him from the gates:</a>
<a id='line_588'>  And Lancelot past away among the flowers,</a>
<a id='line_589'>  (For then was latter April) and returned</a>
<a id='line_590'>  Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.</a>
<a id='line_591'>  To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,</a>
<a id='line_592'>  Chief of the church in Britain, and before</a>
<a id='line_593'>  The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King</a>
<a id='line_594'>  That morn was married, while in stainless white,</a>
<a id='line_595'>  The fair beginners of a nobler time,</a>
<a id='line_596'>  And glorying in their vows and him, his knights</a>
<a id='line_597'>  Stood around him, and rejoicing in his joy.</a>
<a id='line_598'>  Far shone the fields of May through open door,</a>
<a id='line_599'>  The sacred altar blossomed white with May,</a>
<a id='line_600'>  The Sun of May descended on their King,</a>
<a id='line_601'>  They gazed on all earth's beauty in their Queen,</a>
<a id='line_602'>  Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns</a>
<a id='line_603'>  A voice as of the waters, while the two</a>
<a id='line_604'>  Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:</a>
<a id='line_605'>  And Arthur said, 'Behold, thy doom is mine.</a>
<a id='line_606'>  Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!'</a>
<a id='line_607'>  To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,</a>
<a id='line_608'>  'King and my lord, I love thee to the death!'</a>
<a id='line_609'>  And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,</a>
<a id='line_610'>  'Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world</a>
<a id='line_611'>  Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,</a>
<a id='line_612'>  And all this Order of thy Table Round</a>
<a id='line_613'>  Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!'</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>     So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine</a>
<a id='line_616'>  Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood,</a>
<a id='line_617'>  In scornful stillness gazing as they past;</a>
<a id='line_618'>  Then while they paced a city all on fire</a>
<a id='line_619'>  With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,</a>
<a id='line_620'>  And Arthur's knighthood sang before the King:--</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>     'Blow, trumpet, for the world is white with May;</a>
<a id='line_623'>  Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!</a>
<a id='line_624'>  Blow through the living world--"Let the King reign."</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>     'Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur's realm?</a>
<a id='line_627'>  Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm,</a>
<a id='line_628'>  Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.</a>
<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>     'Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard</a>
<a id='line_631'>  That God hath told the King a secret word.</a>
<a id='line_632'>  Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>     'Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.</a>
<a id='line_635'>  Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!</a>
<a id='line_636'>  Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.</a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>     'Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,</a>
<a id='line_639'>  The King is King, and ever wills the highest.</a>
<a id='line_640'>  Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.</a>
<a id='line_641'></a>
<a id='line_642'>     'Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!</a>
<a id='line_643'>  Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!</a>
<a id='line_644'>  Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>     'The King will follow Christ, and we the King</a>
<a id='line_647'>  In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.</a>
<a id='line_648'>  Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.'</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>     So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.</a>
<a id='line_651'>  There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,</a>
<a id='line_652'>  The slowly-fading mistress of the world,</a>
<a id='line_653'>  Strode in, and claimed their tribute as of yore.</a>
<a id='line_654'>  But Arthur spake, 'Behold, for these have sworn</a>
<a id='line_655'>  To wage my wars, and worship me their King;</a>
<a id='line_656'>  The old order changeth, yielding place to new;</a>
<a id='line_657'>  And we that fight for our fair father Christ,</a>
<a id='line_658'>  Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old</a>
<a id='line_659'>  To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,</a>
<a id='line_660'>  No tribute will we pay:' so those great lords</a>
<a id='line_661'>  Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.</a>
<a id='line_662'></a>
<a id='line_663'>     And Arthur and his knighthood for a space</a>
<a id='line_664'>  Were all one will, and through that strength the King</a>
<a id='line_665'>  Drew in the petty princedoms under him,</a>
<a id='line_666'>  Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame</a>
<a id='line_667'>  The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>  Gareth and Lynette</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>  The last tall son of Lot and Bellicent,</a>
<a id='line_674'>  And tallest, Gareth, in a showerful spring</a>
<a id='line_675'>  Stared at the spate.  A slender-shafted Pine</a>
<a id='line_676'>  Lost footing, fell, and so was whirled away.</a>
<a id='line_677'>  'How he went down,' said Gareth, 'as a false knight</a>
<a id='line_678'>  Or evil king before my lance if lance</a>
<a id='line_679'>  Were mine to use--O senseless cataract,</a>
<a id='line_680'>  Bearing all down in thy precipitancy--</a>
<a id='line_681'>  And yet thou art but swollen with cold snows</a>
<a id='line_682'>  And mine is living blood:  thou dost His will,</a>
<a id='line_683'>  The Maker's, and not knowest, and I that know,</a>
<a id='line_684'>  Have strength and wit, in my good mother's hall</a>
<a id='line_685'>  Linger with vacillating obedience,</a>
<a id='line_686'>  Prisoned, and kept and coaxed and whistled to--</a>
<a id='line_687'>  Since the good mother holds me still a child!</a>
<a id='line_688'>  Good mother is bad mother unto me!</a>
<a id='line_689'>  A worse were better; yet no worse would I.</a>
<a id='line_690'>  Heaven yield her for it, but in me put force</a>
<a id='line_691'>  To weary her ears with one continuous prayer,</a>
<a id='line_692'>  Until she let me fly discaged to sweep</a>
<a id='line_693'>  In ever-highering eagle-circles up</a>
<a id='line_694'>  To the great Sun of Glory, and thence swoop</a>
<a id='line_695'>  Down upon all things base, and dash them dead,</a>
<a id='line_696'>  A knight of Arthur, working out his will,</a>
<a id='line_697'>  To cleanse the world.  Why, Gawain, when he came</a>
<a id='line_698'>  With Modred hither in the summertime,</a>
<a id='line_699'>  Asked me to tilt with him, the proven knight.</a>
<a id='line_700'>  Modred for want of worthier was the judge.</a>
<a id='line_701'>  Then I so shook him in the saddle, he said,</a>
<a id='line_702'>  "Thou hast half prevailed against me," said so--he--</a>
<a id='line_703'>  Though Modred biting his thin lips was mute,</a>
<a id='line_704'>  For he is alway sullen:  what care I?'</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>     And Gareth went, and hovering round her chair</a>
<a id='line_707'>  Asked, 'Mother, though ye count me still the child,</a>
<a id='line_708'>  Sweet mother, do ye love the child?'  She laughed,</a>
<a id='line_709'>  'Thou art but a wild-goose to question it.'</a>
<a id='line_710'>  'Then, mother, an ye love the child,' he said,</a>
<a id='line_711'>  'Being a goose and rather tame than wild,</a>
<a id='line_712'>  Hear the child's story.'  'Yea, my well-beloved,</a>
<a id='line_713'>  An 'twere but of the goose and golden eggs.'</a>
<a id='line_714'></a>
<a id='line_715'>     And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,</a>
<a id='line_716'>  'Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine</a>
<a id='line_717'>  Was finer gold than any goose can lay;</a>
<a id='line_718'>  For this an Eagle, a royal Eagle, laid</a>
<a id='line_719'>  Almost beyond eye-reach, on such a palm</a>
<a id='line_720'>  As glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.</a>
<a id='line_721'>  And there was ever haunting round the palm</a>
<a id='line_722'>  A lusty youth, but poor, who often saw</a>
<a id='line_723'>  The splendour sparkling from aloft, and thought</a>
<a id='line_724'>  "An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,</a>
<a id='line_725'>  Then were I wealthier than a leash of kings."</a>
<a id='line_726'>  But ever when he reached a hand to climb,</a>
<a id='line_727'>  One, that had loved him from his childhood, caught</a>
<a id='line_728'>  And stayed him, "Climb not lest thou break thy neck,</a>
<a id='line_729'>  I charge thee by my love," and so the boy,</a>
<a id='line_730'>  Sweet mother, neither clomb, nor brake his neck,</a>
<a id='line_731'>  But brake his very heart in pining for it,</a>
<a id='line_732'>  And past away.'</a>
<a id='line_733'></a>
<a id='line_734'>                 To whom the mother said,</a>
<a id='line_735'>  'True love, sweet son, had risked himself and climbed,</a>
<a id='line_736'>  And handed down the golden treasure to him.'</a>
<a id='line_737'></a>
<a id='line_738'>     And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,</a>
<a id='line_739'>  'Gold?' said I gold?--ay then, why he, or she,</a>
<a id='line_740'>  Or whosoe'er it was, or half the world</a>
<a id='line_741'>  Had ventured--had the thing I spake of been</a>
<a id='line_742'>  Mere gold--but this was all of that true steel,</a>
<a id='line_743'>  Whereof they forged the brand Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_744'>  And lightnings played about it in the storm,</a>
<a id='line_745'>  And all the little fowl were flurried at it,</a>
<a id='line_746'>  And there were cries and clashings in the nest,</a>
<a id='line_747'>  That sent him from his senses:  let me go.'</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>     Then Bellicent bemoaned herself and said,</a>
<a id='line_750'>  'Hast thou no pity upon my loneliness?</a>
<a id='line_751'>  Lo, where thy father Lot beside the hearth</a>
<a id='line_752'>  Lies like a log, and all but smouldered out!</a>
<a id='line_753'>  For ever since when traitor to the King</a>
<a id='line_754'>  He fought against him in the Barons' war,</a>
<a id='line_755'>  And Arthur gave him back his territory,</a>
<a id='line_756'>  His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there</a>
<a id='line_757'>  A yet-warm corpse, and yet unburiable,</a>
<a id='line_758'>  No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows.</a>
<a id='line_759'>  And both thy brethren are in Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_760'>  Albeit neither loved with that full love</a>
<a id='line_761'>  I feel for thee, nor worthy such a love:</a>
<a id='line_762'>  Stay therefore thou; red berries charm the bird,</a>
<a id='line_763'>  And thee, mine innocent, the jousts, the wars,</a>
<a id='line_764'>  Who never knewest finger-ache, nor pang</a>
<a id='line_765'>  Of wrenched or broken limb--an often chance</a>
<a id='line_766'>  In those brain-stunning shocks, and tourney-falls,</a>
<a id='line_767'>  Frights to my heart; but stay:  follow the deer</a>
<a id='line_768'>  By these tall firs and our fast-falling burns;</a>
<a id='line_769'>  So make thy manhood mightier day by day;</a>
<a id='line_770'>  Sweet is the chase:  and I will seek thee out</a>
<a id='line_771'>  Some comfortable bride and fair, to grace</a>
<a id='line_772'>  Thy climbing life, and cherish my prone year,</a>
<a id='line_773'>  Till falling into Lot's forgetfulness</a>
<a id='line_774'>  I know not thee, myself, nor anything.</a>
<a id='line_775'>  Stay, my best son! ye are yet more boy than man.'</a>
<a id='line_776'></a>
<a id='line_777'>     Then Gareth, 'An ye hold me yet for child,</a>
<a id='line_778'>  Hear yet once more the story of the child.</a>
<a id='line_779'>  For, mother, there was once a King, like ours.</a>
<a id='line_780'>  The prince his heir, when tall and marriageable,</a>
<a id='line_781'>  Asked for a bride; and thereupon the King</a>
<a id='line_782'>  Set two before him.  One was fair, strong, armed--</a>
<a id='line_783'>  But to be won by force--and many men</a>
<a id='line_784'>  Desired her; one good lack, no man desired.</a>
<a id='line_785'>  And these were the conditions of the King:</a>
<a id='line_786'>  That save he won the first by force, he needs</a>
<a id='line_787'>  Must wed that other, whom no man desired,</a>
<a id='line_788'>  A red-faced bride who knew herself so vile,</a>
<a id='line_789'>  That evermore she longed to hide herself,</a>
<a id='line_790'>  Nor fronted man or woman, eye to eye--</a>
<a id='line_791'>  Yea--some she cleaved to, but they died of her.</a>
<a id='line_792'>  And one--they called her Fame; and one,--O Mother,</a>
<a id='line_793'>  How can ye keep me tethered to you--Shame.</a>
<a id='line_794'>  Man am I grown, a man's work must I do.</a>
<a id='line_795'>  Follow the deer? follow the Christ, the King,</a>
<a id='line_796'>  Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--</a>
<a id='line_797'>  Else, wherefore born?'</a>
<a id='line_798'></a>
<a id='line_799'>                        To whom the mother said</a>
<a id='line_800'>  'Sweet son, for there be many who deem him not,</a>
<a id='line_801'>  Or will not deem him, wholly proven King--</a>
<a id='line_802'>  Albeit in mine own heart I knew him King,</a>
<a id='line_803'>  When I was frequent with him in my youth,</a>
<a id='line_804'>  And heard him Kingly speak, and doubted him</a>
<a id='line_805'>  No more than he, himself; but felt him mine,</a>
<a id='line_806'>  Of closest kin to me:  yet--wilt thou leave</a>
<a id='line_807'>  Thine easeful biding here, and risk thine all,</a>
<a id='line_808'>  Life, limbs, for one that is not proven King?</a>
<a id='line_809'>  Stay, till the cloud that settles round his birth</a>
<a id='line_810'>  Hath lifted but a little.  Stay, sweet son.'</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>     And Gareth answered quickly, 'Not an hour,</a>
<a id='line_813'>  So that ye yield me--I will walk through fire,</a>
<a id='line_814'>  Mother, to gain it--your full leave to go.</a>
<a id='line_815'>  Not proven, who swept the dust of ruined Rome</a>
<a id='line_816'>  From off the threshold of the realm, and crushed</a>
<a id='line_817'>  The Idolaters, and made the people free?</a>
<a id='line_818'>  Who should be King save him who makes us free?'</a>
<a id='line_819'></a>
<a id='line_820'>     So when the Queen, who long had sought in vain</a>
<a id='line_821'>  To break him from the intent to which he grew,</a>
<a id='line_822'>  Found her son's will unwaveringly one,</a>
<a id='line_823'>  She answered craftily, 'Will ye walk through fire?</a>
<a id='line_824'>  Who walks through fire will hardly heed the smoke.</a>
<a id='line_825'>  Ay, go then, an ye must:  only one proof,</a>
<a id='line_826'>  Before thou ask the King to make thee knight,</a>
<a id='line_827'>  Of thine obedience and thy love to me,</a>
<a id='line_828'>  Thy mother,--I demand.</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>                        And Gareth cried,</a>
<a id='line_831'>  'A hard one, or a hundred, so I go.</a>
<a id='line_832'>  Nay--quick! the proof to prove me to the quick!'</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>     But slowly spake the mother looking at him,</a>
<a id='line_835'>  'Prince, thou shalt go disguised to Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_836'>  And hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks</a>
<a id='line_837'>  Among the scullions and the kitchen-knaves,</a>
<a id='line_838'>  And those that hand the dish across the bar.</a>
<a id='line_839'>  Nor shalt thou tell thy name to anyone.</a>
<a id='line_840'>  And thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day.'</a>
<a id='line_841'></a>
<a id='line_842'>     For so the Queen believed that when her son</a>
<a id='line_843'>  Beheld his only way to glory lead</a>
<a id='line_844'>  Low down through villain kitchen-vassalage,</a>
<a id='line_845'>  Her own true Gareth was too princely-proud</a>
<a id='line_846'>  To pass thereby; so should he rest with her,</a>
<a id='line_847'>  Closed in her castle from the sound of arms.</a>
<a id='line_848'></a>
<a id='line_849'>     Silent awhile was Gareth, then replied,</a>
<a id='line_850'>  'The thrall in person may be free in soul,</a>
<a id='line_851'>  And I shall see the jousts.  Thy son am I,</a>
<a id='line_852'>  And since thou art my mother, must obey.</a>
<a id='line_853'>  I therefore yield me freely to thy will;</a>
<a id='line_854'>  For hence will I, disguised, and hire myself</a>
<a id='line_855'>  To serve with scullions and with kitchen-knaves;</a>
<a id='line_856'>  Nor tell my name to any--no, not the King.'</a>
<a id='line_857'></a>
<a id='line_858'>     Gareth awhile lingered.  The mother's eye</a>
<a id='line_859'>  Full of the wistful fear that he would go,</a>
<a id='line_860'>  And turning toward him wheresoe'er he turned,</a>
<a id='line_861'>  Perplext his outward purpose, till an hour,</a>
<a id='line_862'>  When wakened by the wind which with full voice</a>
<a id='line_863'>  Swept bellowing through the darkness on to dawn,</a>
<a id='line_864'>  He rose, and out of slumber calling two</a>
<a id='line_865'>  That still had tended on him from his birth,</a>
<a id='line_866'>  Before the wakeful mother heard him, went.</a>
<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>     The three were clad like tillers of the soil.</a>
<a id='line_869'>  Southward they set their faces.  The birds made</a>
<a id='line_870'>  Melody on branch, and melody in mid air.</a>
<a id='line_871'>  The damp hill-slopes were quickened into green,</a>
<a id='line_872'>  And the live green had kindled into flowers,</a>
<a id='line_873'>  For it was past the time of Easterday.</a>
<a id='line_874'></a>
<a id='line_875'>     So, when their feet were planted on the plain</a>
<a id='line_876'>  That broadened toward the base of Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_877'>  Far off they saw the silver-misty morn</a>
<a id='line_878'>  Rolling her smoke about the Royal mount,</a>
<a id='line_879'>  That rose between the forest and the field.</a>
<a id='line_880'>  At times the summit of the high city flashed;</a>
<a id='line_881'>  At times the spires and turrets half-way down</a>
<a id='line_882'>  Pricked through the mist; at times the great gate shone</a>
<a id='line_883'>  Only, that opened on the field below:</a>
<a id='line_884'>  Anon, the whole fair city had disappeared.</a>
<a id='line_885'></a>
<a id='line_886'>     Then those who went with Gareth were amazed,</a>
<a id='line_887'>  One crying, 'Let us go no further, lord.</a>
<a id='line_888'>  Here is a city of Enchanters, built</a>
<a id='line_889'>  By fairy Kings.'  The second echoed him,</a>
<a id='line_890'>  'Lord, we have heard from our wise man at home</a>
<a id='line_891'>  To Northward, that this King is not the King,</a>
<a id='line_892'>  But only changeling out of Fairyland,</a>
<a id='line_893'>  Who drave the heathen hence by sorcery</a>
<a id='line_894'>  And Merlin's glamour.'  Then the first again,</a>
<a id='line_895'>  'Lord, there is no such city anywhere,</a>
<a id='line_896'>  But all a vision.'</a>
<a id='line_897'></a>
<a id='line_898'>                    Gareth answered them</a>
<a id='line_899'>  With laughter, swearing he had glamour enow</a>
<a id='line_900'>  In his own blood, his princedom, youth and hopes,</a>
<a id='line_901'>  To plunge old Merlin in the Arabian sea;</a>
<a id='line_902'>  So pushed them all unwilling toward the gate.</a>
<a id='line_903'>  And there was no gate like it under heaven.</a>
<a id='line_904'>  For barefoot on the keystone, which was lined</a>
<a id='line_905'>  And rippled like an ever-fleeting wave,</a>
<a id='line_906'>  The Lady of the Lake stood:  all her dress</a>
<a id='line_907'>  Wept from her sides as water flowing away;</a>
<a id='line_908'>  But like the cross her great and goodly arms</a>
<a id='line_909'>  Stretched under the cornice and upheld:</a>
<a id='line_910'>  And drops of water fell from either hand;</a>
<a id='line_911'>  And down from one a sword was hung, from one</a>
<a id='line_912'>  A censer, either worn with wind and storm;</a>
<a id='line_913'>  And o'er her breast floated the sacred fish;</a>
<a id='line_914'>  And in the space to left of her, and right,</a>
<a id='line_915'>  Were Arthur's wars in weird devices done,</a>
<a id='line_916'>  New things and old co-twisted, as if Time</a>
<a id='line_917'>  Were nothing, so inveterately, that men</a>
<a id='line_918'>  Were giddy gazing there; and over all</a>
<a id='line_919'>  High on the top were those three Queens, the friends</a>
<a id='line_920'>  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need.</a>
<a id='line_921'></a>
<a id='line_922'>     Then those with Gareth for so long a space</a>
<a id='line_923'>  Stared at the figures, that at last it seemed</a>
<a id='line_924'>  The dragon-boughts and elvish emblemings</a>
<a id='line_925'>  Began to move, seethe, twine and curl:  they called</a>
<a id='line_926'>  To Gareth, 'Lord, the gateway is alive.'</a>
<a id='line_927'></a>
<a id='line_928'>     And Gareth likewise on them fixt his eyes</a>
<a id='line_929'>  So long, that even to him they seemed to move.</a>
<a id='line_930'>  Out of the city a blast of music pealed.</a>
<a id='line_931'>  Back from the gate started the three, to whom</a>
<a id='line_932'>  From out thereunder came an ancient man,</a>
<a id='line_933'>  Long-bearded, saying, 'Who be ye, my sons?'</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>     Then Gareth, 'We be tillers of the soil,</a>
<a id='line_936'>  Who leaving share in furrow come to see</a>
<a id='line_937'>  The glories of our King:  but these, my men,</a>
<a id='line_938'>  (Your city moved so weirdly in the mist)</a>
<a id='line_939'>  Doubt if the King be King at all, or come</a>
<a id='line_940'>  From Fairyland; and whether this be built</a>
<a id='line_941'>  By magic, and by fairy Kings and Queens;</a>
<a id='line_942'>  Or whether there be any city at all,</a>
<a id='line_943'>  Or all a vision:  and this music now</a>
<a id='line_944'>  Hath scared them both, but tell thou these the truth.'</a>
<a id='line_945'></a>
<a id='line_946'>     Then that old Seer made answer playing on him</a>
<a id='line_947'>  And saying, 'Son, I have seen the good ship sail</a>
<a id='line_948'>  Keel upward, and mast downward, in the heavens,</a>
<a id='line_949'>  And solid turrets topsy-turvy in air:</a>
<a id='line_950'>  And here is truth; but an it please thee not,</a>
<a id='line_951'>  Take thou the truth as thou hast told it me.</a>
<a id='line_952'>  For truly as thou sayest, a Fairy King</a>
<a id='line_953'>  And Fairy Queens have built the city, son;</a>
<a id='line_954'>  They came from out a sacred mountain-cleft</a>
<a id='line_955'>  Toward the sunrise, each with harp in hand,</a>
<a id='line_956'>  And built it to the music of their harps.</a>
<a id='line_957'>  And, as thou sayest, it is enchanted, son,</a>
<a id='line_958'>  For there is nothing in it as it seems</a>
<a id='line_959'>  Saving the King; though some there be that hold</a>
<a id='line_960'>  The King a shadow, and the city real:</a>
<a id='line_961'>  Yet take thou heed of him, for, so thou pass</a>
<a id='line_962'>  Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become</a>
<a id='line_963'>  A thrall to his enchantments, for the King</a>
<a id='line_964'>  Will bind thee by such vows, as is a shame</a>
<a id='line_965'>  A man should not be bound by, yet the which</a>
<a id='line_966'>  No man can keep; but, so thou dread to swear,</a>
<a id='line_967'>  Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide</a>
<a id='line_968'>  Without, among the cattle of the field.</a>
<a id='line_969'>  For an ye heard a music, like enow</a>
<a id='line_970'>  They are building still, seeing the city is built</a>
<a id='line_971'>  To music, therefore never built at all,</a>
<a id='line_972'>  And therefore built for ever.'</a>
<a id='line_973'></a>
<a id='line_974'>                                Gareth spake</a>
<a id='line_975'>  Angered, 'Old master, reverence thine own beard</a>
<a id='line_976'>  That looks as white as utter truth, and seems</a>
<a id='line_977'>  Wellnigh as long as thou art statured tall!</a>
<a id='line_978'>  Why mockest thou the stranger that hath been</a>
<a id='line_979'>  To thee fair-spoken?'</a>
<a id='line_980'></a>
<a id='line_981'>                       But the Seer replied,</a>
<a id='line_982'>  'Know ye not then the Riddling of the Bards?</a>
<a id='line_983'>  "Confusion, and illusion, and relation,</a>

<a id='line_985'>  I mock thee not but as thou mockest me,</a>
<a id='line_986'>  And all that see thee, for thou art not who</a>
<a id='line_987'>  Thou seemest, but I know thee who thou art.</a>
<a id='line_988'>  And now thou goest up to mock the King,</a>
<a id='line_989'>  Who cannot brook the shadow of any lie.'</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>     Unmockingly the mocker ending here</a>
<a id='line_992'>  Turned to the right, and past along the plain;</a>
<a id='line_993'>  Whom Gareth looking after said, 'My men,</a>
<a id='line_994'>  Our one white lie sits like a little ghost</a>
<a id='line_995'>  Here on the threshold of our enterprise.</a>
<a id='line_996'>  Let love be blamed for it, not she, nor I:</a>
<a id='line_997'>  Well, we will make amends.'</a>
<a id='line_998'></a>
<a id='line_999'>                             With all good cheer</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  He spake and laughed, then entered with his twain</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  Camelot, a city of shadowy palaces</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  And stately, rich in emblem and the work</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  Of ancient kings who did their days in stone;</a>
<a id='line_1004'>  Which Merlin's hand, the Mage at Arthur's court,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  Knowing all arts, had touched, and everywhere</a>
<a id='line_1006'>  At Arthur's ordinance, tipt with lessening peak</a>
<a id='line_1007'>  And pinnacle, and had made it spire to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  And ever and anon a knight would pass</a>
<a id='line_1009'>  Outward, or inward to the hall:  his arms</a>
<a id='line_1010'>  Clashed; and the sound was good to Gareth's ear.</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  And out of bower and casement shyly glanced</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  Eyes of pure women, wholesome stars of love;</a>
<a id='line_1013'>  And all about a healthful people stept</a>
<a id='line_1014'>  As in the presence of a gracious king.</a>
<a id='line_1015'></a>
<a id='line_1016'>     Then into hall Gareth ascending heard</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  A voice, the voice of Arthur, and beheld</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  Far over heads in that long-vaulted hall</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  The splendour of the presence of the King</a>
<a id='line_1020'>  Throned, and delivering doom--and looked no more--</a>
<a id='line_1021'>  But felt his young heart hammering in his ears,</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  And thought, 'For this half-shadow of a lie</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  The truthful King will doom me when I speak.'</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  Yet pressing on, though all in fear to find</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  Sir Gawain or Sir Modred, saw nor one</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  Nor other, but in all the listening eyes</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  Of those tall knights, that ranged about the throne,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>  Clear honour shining like the dewy star</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  Of dawn, and faith in their great King, with pure</a>
<a id='line_1030'>  Affection, and the light of victory,</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  And glory gained, and evermore to gain.</a>
<a id='line_1032'>     Then came a widow crying to the King,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  'A boon, Sir King!  Thy father, Uther, reft</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  From my dead lord a field with violence:</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  For howsoe'er at first he proffered gold,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  Yet, for the field was pleasant in our eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  We yielded not; and then he reft us of it</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  Perforce, and left us neither gold nor field.'</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>     Said Arthur, 'Whether would ye? gold or field?'</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  To whom the woman weeping, 'Nay, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  The field was pleasant in my husband's eye.'</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>     And Arthur, 'Have thy pleasant field again,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  And thrice the gold for Uther's use thereof,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  According to the years.  No boon is here,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  But justice, so thy say be proven true.</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  Accursed, who from the wrongs his father did</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  Would shape himself a right!'</a>
<a id='line_1050'></a>
<a id='line_1051'>                               And while she past,</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  Came yet another widow crying to him,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  'A boon, Sir King!  Thine enemy, King, am I.</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  With thine own hand thou slewest my dear lord,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  A knight of Uther in the Barons' war,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  When Lot and many another rose and fought</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  Against thee, saying thou wert basely born.</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  I held with these, and loathe to ask thee aught.</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  Yet lo! my husband's brother had my son</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  Thralled in his castle, and hath starved him dead;</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  And standeth seized of that inheritance</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  Which thou that slewest the sire hast left the son.</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  So though I scarce can ask it thee for hate,</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  Grant me some knight to do the battle for me,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son.'</a>
<a id='line_1066'></a>
<a id='line_1067'>     Then strode a good knight forward, crying to him,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  'A boon, Sir King!  I am her kinsman, I.</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  Give me to right her wrong, and slay the man.'</a>
<a id='line_1070'></a>
<a id='line_1071'>     Then came Sir Kay, the seneschal, and cried,</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  'A boon, Sir King! even that thou grant her none,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  This railer, that hath mocked thee in full hall--</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  None; or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag.'</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>     But Arthur, 'We sit King, to help the wronged</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  Through all our realm.  The woman loves her lord.</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  Peace to thee, woman, with thy loves and hates!</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  The kings of old had doomed thee to the flames,</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  Aurelius Emrys would have scourged thee dead,</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  And Uther slit thy tongue:  but get thee hence--</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  Lest that rough humour of the kings of old</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  Return upon me!  Thou that art her kin,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  Go likewise; lay him low and slay him not,</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  But bring him here, that I may judge the right,</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  According to the justice of the King:</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  Then, be he guilty, by that deathless King</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  Who lived and died for men, the man shall die.'</a>
<a id='line_1089'></a>
<a id='line_1090'>     Then came in hall the messenger of Mark,</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  A name of evil savour in the land,</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  The Cornish king.  In either hand he bore</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  What dazzled all, and shone far-off as shines</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  A field of charlock in the sudden sun</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  Between two showers, a cloth of palest gold,</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  Which down he laid before the throne, and knelt,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  Delivering, that his lord, the vassal king,</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  Was even upon his way to Camelot;</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  For having heard that Arthur of his grace</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  Had made his goodly cousin, Tristram, knight,</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  And, for himself was of the greater state,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  Being a king, he trusted his liege-lord</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  Would yield him this large honour all the more;</a>
<a id='line_1104'>  So prayed him well to accept this cloth of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1105'>  In token of true heart and fealty.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>     Then Arthur cried to rend the cloth, to rend</a>
<a id='line_1108'>  In pieces, and so cast it on the hearth.</a>
<a id='line_1109'>  An oak-tree smouldered there.  'The goodly knight!</a>
<a id='line_1110'>  What! shall the shield of Mark stand among these?'</a>
<a id='line_1111'>  For, midway down the side of that long hall</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  A stately pile,--whereof along the front,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>  Some blazoned, some but carven, and some blank,</a>
<a id='line_1114'>  There ran a treble range of stony shields,--</a>
<a id='line_1115'>  Rose, and high-arching overbrowed the hearth.</a>
<a id='line_1116'>  And under every shield a knight was named:</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  For this was Arthur's custom in his hall;</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  When some good knight had done one noble deed,</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  His arms were carven only; but if twain</a>
<a id='line_1120'>  His arms were blazoned also; but if none,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>  The shield was blank and bare without a sign</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  Saving the name beneath; and Gareth saw</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  The shield of Gawain blazoned rich and bright,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  And Modred's blank as death; and Arthur cried</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  To rend the cloth and cast it on the hearth.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>     'More like are we to reave him of his crown</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  Than make him knight because men call him king.</a>
<a id='line_1129'>  The kings we found, ye know we stayed their hands</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  From war among themselves, but left them kings;</a>
<a id='line_1131'>  Of whom were any bounteous, merciful,</a>
<a id='line_1132'>  Truth-speaking, brave, good livers, them we enrolled</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  Among us, and they sit within our hall.</a>
<a id='line_1134'>  But as Mark hath tarnished the great name of king,</a>
<a id='line_1135'>  As Mark would sully the low state of churl:</a>
<a id='line_1136'>  And, seeing he hath sent us cloth of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1137'>  Return, and meet, and hold him from our eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1138'>  Lest we should lap him up in cloth of lead,</a>
<a id='line_1139'>  Silenced for ever--craven--a man of plots,</a>
<a id='line_1140'>  Craft, poisonous counsels, wayside ambushings--</a>
<a id='line_1141'>  No fault of thine:  let Kay the seneschal</a>
<a id='line_1142'>  Look to thy wants, and send thee satisfied--</a>
<a id='line_1143'>  Accursed, who strikes nor lets the hand be seen!'</a>
<a id='line_1144'></a>
<a id='line_1145'>     And many another suppliant crying came</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  With noise of ravage wrought by beast and man,</a>
<a id='line_1147'>  And evermore a knight would ride away.</a>
<a id='line_1148'></a>
<a id='line_1149'>     Last, Gareth leaning both hands heavily</a>
<a id='line_1150'>  Down on the shoulders of the twain, his men,</a>
<a id='line_1151'>  Approached between them toward the King, and asked,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  'A boon, Sir King (his voice was all ashamed),</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  For see ye not how weak and hungerworn</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  I seem--leaning on these? grant me to serve</a>
<a id='line_1155'>  For meat and drink among thy kitchen-knaves</a>
<a id='line_1156'>  A twelvemonth and a day, nor seek my name.</a>
<a id='line_1157'>  Hereafter I will fight.'</a>
<a id='line_1158'></a>
<a id='line_1159'>                          To him the King,</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  'A goodly youth and worth a goodlier boon!</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  But so thou wilt no goodlier, then must Kay,</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  The master of the meats and drinks, be thine.'</a>
<a id='line_1163'></a>
<a id='line_1164'>     He rose and past; then Kay, a man of mien</a>
<a id='line_1165'>  Wan-sallow as the plant that feels itself</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  Root-bitten by white lichen,</a>
<a id='line_1167'></a>
<a id='line_1168'>                              'Lo ye now!</a>
<a id='line_1169'>  This fellow hath broken from some Abbey, where,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>  God wot, he had not beef and brewis enow,</a>
<a id='line_1171'>  However that might chance! but an he work,</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  Like any pigeon will I cram his crop,</a>
<a id='line_1173'>  And sleeker shall he shine than any hog.'</a>
<a id='line_1174'></a>
<a id='line_1175'>     Then Lancelot standing near, 'Sir Seneschal,</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  Sleuth-hound thou knowest, and gray, and all the hounds;</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  A horse thou knowest, a man thou dost not know:</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  Broad brows and fair, a fluent hair and fine,</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  High nose, a nostril large and fine, and hands</a>
<a id='line_1180'>  Large, fair and fine!--Some young lad's mystery--</a>
<a id='line_1181'>  But, or from sheepcot or king's hall, the boy</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  Is noble-natured.  Treat him with all grace,</a>
<a id='line_1183'>  Lest he should come to shame thy judging of him.'</a>
<a id='line_1184'></a>
<a id='line_1185'>     Then Kay, 'What murmurest thou of mystery?</a>
<a id='line_1186'>  Think ye this fellow will poison the King's dish?</a>
<a id='line_1187'>  Nay, for he spake too fool-like:  mystery!</a>
<a id='line_1188'>  Tut, an the lad were noble, he had asked</a>
<a id='line_1189'>  For horse and armour:  fair and fine, forsooth!</a>
<a id='line_1190'>  Sir Fine-face, Sir Fair-hands? but see thou to it</a>
<a id='line_1191'>  That thine own fineness, Lancelot, some fine day</a>
<a id='line_1192'>  Undo thee not--and leave my man to me.'</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>     So Gareth all for glory underwent</a>
<a id='line_1195'>  The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage;</a>
<a id='line_1196'>  Ate with young lads his portion by the door,</a>
<a id='line_1197'>  And couched at night with grimy kitchen-knaves.</a>
<a id='line_1198'>  And Lancelot ever spake him pleasantly,</a>
<a id='line_1199'>  But Kay the seneschal, who loved him not,</a>
<a id='line_1200'>  Would hustle and harry him, and labour him</a>
<a id='line_1201'>  Beyond his comrade of the hearth, and set</a>
<a id='line_1202'>  To turn the broach, draw water, or hew wood,</a>
<a id='line_1203'>  Or grosser tasks; and Gareth bowed himself</a>
<a id='line_1204'>  With all obedience to the King, and wrought</a>
<a id='line_1205'>  All kind of service with a noble ease</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  That graced the lowliest act in doing it.</a>
<a id='line_1207'>  And when the thralls had talk among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_1208'>  And one would praise the love that linkt the King</a>
<a id='line_1209'>  And Lancelot--how the King had saved his life</a>
<a id='line_1210'>  In battle twice, and Lancelot once the King's--</a>
<a id='line_1211'>  For Lancelot was the first in Tournament,</a>
<a id='line_1212'>  But Arthur mightiest on the battle-field--</a>
<a id='line_1213'>  Gareth was glad.  Or if some other told,</a>
<a id='line_1214'>  How once the wandering forester at dawn,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>  Far over the blue tarns and hazy seas,</a>
<a id='line_1216'>  On Caer-Eryri's highest found the King,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>  A naked babe, of whom the Prophet spake,</a>
<a id='line_1218'>  'He passes to the Isle Avilion,</a>
<a id='line_1219'>  He passes and is healed and cannot die'--</a>
<a id='line_1220'>  Gareth was glad.  But if their talk were foul,</a>
<a id='line_1221'>  Then would he whistle rapid as any lark,</a>
<a id='line_1222'>  Or carol some old roundelay, and so loud</a>
<a id='line_1223'>  That first they mocked, but, after, reverenced him.</a>
<a id='line_1224'>  Or Gareth telling some prodigious tale</a>
<a id='line_1225'>  Of knights, who sliced a red life-bubbling way</a>
<a id='line_1226'>  Through twenty folds of twisted dragon, held</a>
<a id='line_1227'>  All in a gap-mouthed circle his good mates</a>
<a id='line_1228'>  Lying or sitting round him, idle hands,</a>
<a id='line_1229'>  Charmed; till Sir Kay, the seneschal, would come</a>
<a id='line_1230'>  Blustering upon them, like a sudden wind</a>
<a id='line_1231'>  Among dead leaves, and drive them all apart.</a>
<a id='line_1232'>  Or when the thralls had sport among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>  So there were any trial of mastery,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>  He, by two yards in casting bar or stone</a>
<a id='line_1235'>  Was counted best; and if there chanced a joust,</a>
<a id='line_1236'>  So that Sir Kay nodded him leave to go,</a>
<a id='line_1237'>  Would hurry thither, and when he saw the knights</a>
<a id='line_1238'>  Clash like the coming and retiring wave,</a>
<a id='line_1239'>  And the spear spring, and good horse reel, the boy</a>
<a id='line_1240'>  Was half beyond himself for ecstasy.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>     So for a month he wrought among the thralls;</a>
<a id='line_1243'>  But in the weeks that followed, the good Queen,</a>
<a id='line_1244'>  Repentant of the word she made him swear,</a>
<a id='line_1245'>  And saddening in her childless castle, sent,</a>
<a id='line_1246'>  Between the in-crescent and de-crescent moon,</a>
<a id='line_1247'>  Arms for her son, and loosed him from his vow.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>     This, Gareth hearing from a squire of Lot</a>
<a id='line_1250'>  With whom he used to play at tourney once,</a>
<a id='line_1251'>  When both were children, and in lonely haunts</a>
<a id='line_1252'>  Would scratch a ragged oval on the sand,</a>
<a id='line_1253'>  And each at either dash from either end--</a>
<a id='line_1254'>  Shame never made girl redder than Gareth joy.</a>
<a id='line_1255'>  He laughed; he sprang.  'Out of the smoke, at once</a>
<a id='line_1256'>  I leap from Satan's foot to Peter's knee--</a>
<a id='line_1257'>  These news be mine, none other's--nay, the King's--</a>
<a id='line_1258'>  Descend into the city:' whereon he sought</a>
<a id='line_1259'>  The King alone, and found, and told him all.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>     'I have staggered thy strong Gawain in a tilt</a>
<a id='line_1262'>  For pastime; yea, he said it:  joust can I.</a>
<a id='line_1263'>  Make me thy knight--in secret! let my name</a>
<a id='line_1264'>  Be hidden, and give me the first quest, I spring</a>
<a id='line_1265'>  Like flame from ashes.'</a>
<a id='line_1266'></a>
<a id='line_1267'>                         Here the King's calm eye</a>
<a id='line_1268'>  Fell on, and checked, and made him flush, and bow</a>
<a id='line_1269'>  Lowly, to kiss his hand, who answered him,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>  'Son, the good mother let me know thee here,</a>
<a id='line_1271'>  And sent her wish that I would yield thee thine.</a>
<a id='line_1272'>  Make thee my knight? my knights are sworn to vows</a>
<a id='line_1273'>  Of utter hardihood, utter gentleness,</a>
<a id='line_1274'>  And, loving, utter faithfulness in love,</a>
<a id='line_1275'>  And uttermost obedience to the King.'</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>     Then Gareth, lightly springing from his knees,</a>
<a id='line_1278'>  'My King, for hardihood I can promise thee.</a>
<a id='line_1279'>  For uttermost obedience make demand</a>
<a id='line_1280'>  Of whom ye gave me to, the Seneschal,</a>
<a id='line_1281'>  No mellow master of the meats and drinks!</a>
<a id='line_1282'>  And as for love, God wot, I love not yet,</a>
<a id='line_1283'>  But love I shall, God willing.'</a>
<a id='line_1284'></a>
<a id='line_1285'>                                 And the King</a>
<a id='line_1286'>  'Make thee my knight in secret? yea, but he,</a>
<a id='line_1287'>  Our noblest brother, and our truest man,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>  And one with me in all, he needs must know.'</a>
<a id='line_1289'></a>
<a id='line_1290'>     'Let Lancelot know, my King, let Lancelot know,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>  Thy noblest and thy truest!'</a>
<a id='line_1292'></a>
<a id='line_1293'>                              And the King--</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  'But wherefore would ye men should wonder at you?</a>
<a id='line_1295'>  Nay, rather for the sake of me, their King,</a>
<a id='line_1296'>  And the deed's sake my knighthood do the deed,</a>
<a id='line_1297'>  Than to be noised of.'</a>
<a id='line_1298'></a>
<a id='line_1299'>                        Merrily Gareth asked,</a>
<a id='line_1300'>  'Have I not earned my cake in baking of it?</a>
<a id='line_1301'>  Let be my name until I make my name!</a>
<a id='line_1302'>  My deeds will speak:  it is but for a day.'</a>
<a id='line_1303'>  So with a kindly hand on Gareth's arm</a>
<a id='line_1304'>  Smiled the great King, and half-unwillingly</a>
<a id='line_1305'>  Loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him.</a>
<a id='line_1306'>  Then, after summoning Lancelot privily,</a>
<a id='line_1307'>  'I have given him the first quest:  he is not proven.</a>
<a id='line_1308'>  Look therefore when he calls for this in hall,</a>
<a id='line_1309'>  Thou get to horse and follow him far away.</a>
<a id='line_1310'>  Cover the lions on thy shield, and see</a>
<a id='line_1311'>  Far as thou mayest, he be nor ta'en nor slain.'</a>
<a id='line_1312'></a>
<a id='line_1313'>     Then that same day there past into the hall</a>
<a id='line_1314'>  A damsel of high lineage, and a brow</a>
<a id='line_1315'>  May-blossom, and a cheek of apple-blossom,</a>
<a id='line_1316'>  Hawk-eyes; and lightly was her slender nose</a>
<a id='line_1317'>  Tip-tilted like the petal of a flower;</a>
<a id='line_1318'>  She into hall past with her page and cried,</a>
<a id='line_1319'></a>
<a id='line_1320'>     'O King, for thou hast driven the foe without,</a>
<a id='line_1321'>  See to the foe within! bridge, ford, beset</a>
<a id='line_1322'>  By bandits, everyone that owns a tower</a>
<a id='line_1323'>  The Lord for half a league.  Why sit ye there?</a>
<a id='line_1324'>  Rest would I not, Sir King, an I were king,</a>
<a id='line_1325'>  Till even the lonest hold were all as free</a>
<a id='line_1326'>  From cursed bloodshed, as thine altar-cloth</a>
<a id='line_1327'>  From that best blood it is a sin to spill.'</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>     'Comfort thyself,' said Arthur.  'I nor mine</a>
<a id='line_1330'>  Rest:  so my knighthood keep the vows they swore,</a>
<a id='line_1331'>  The wastest moorland of our realm shall be</a>
<a id='line_1332'>  Safe, damsel, as the centre of this hall.</a>
<a id='line_1333'>  What is thy name? thy need?'</a>
<a id='line_1334'></a>
<a id='line_1335'>                              'My name?' she said--</a>
<a id='line_1336'>  'Lynette my name; noble; my need, a knight</a>
<a id='line_1337'>  To combat for my sister, Lyonors,</a>
<a id='line_1338'>  A lady of high lineage, of great lands,</a>
<a id='line_1339'>  And comely, yea, and comelier than myself.</a>
<a id='line_1340'>  She lives in Castle Perilous:  a river</a>
<a id='line_1341'>  Runs in three loops about her living-place;</a>
<a id='line_1342'>  And o'er it are three passings, and three knights</a>
<a id='line_1343'>  Defend the passings, brethren, and a fourth</a>
<a id='line_1344'>  And of that four the mightiest, holds her stayed</a>
<a id='line_1345'>  In her own castle, and so besieges her</a>
<a id='line_1346'>  To break her will, and make her wed with him:</a>
<a id='line_1347'>  And but delays his purport till thou send</a>
<a id='line_1348'>  To do the battle with him, thy chief man</a>
<a id='line_1349'>  Sir Lancelot whom he trusts to overthrow,</a>
<a id='line_1350'>  Then wed, with glory:  but she will not wed</a>
<a id='line_1351'>  Save whom she loveth, or a holy life.</a>
<a id='line_1352'>  Now therefore have I come for Lancelot.'</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>     Then Arthur mindful of Sir Gareth asked,</a>
<a id='line_1355'>  'Damsel, ye know this Order lives to crush</a>
<a id='line_1356'>  All wrongers of the Realm.  But say, these four,</a>
<a id='line_1357'>  Who be they?  What the fashion of the men?'</a>
<a id='line_1358'></a>
<a id='line_1359'>     'They be of foolish fashion, O Sir King,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>  The fashion of that old knight-errantry</a>
<a id='line_1361'>  Who ride abroad, and do but what they will;</a>
<a id='line_1362'>  Courteous or bestial from the moment, such</a>
<a id='line_1363'>  As have nor law nor king; and three of these</a>
<a id='line_1364'>  Proud in their fantasy call themselves the Day,</a>
<a id='line_1365'>  Morning-Star, and Noon-Sun, and Evening-Star,</a>
<a id='line_1366'>  Being strong fools; and never a whit more wise</a>
<a id='line_1367'>  The fourth, who alway rideth armed in black,</a>
<a id='line_1368'>  A huge man-beast of boundless savagery.</a>
<a id='line_1369'>  He names himself the Night and oftener Death,</a>
<a id='line_1370'>  And wears a helmet mounted with a skull,</a>
<a id='line_1371'>  And bears a skeleton figured on his arms,</a>
<a id='line_1372'>  To show that who may slay or scape the three,</a>
<a id='line_1373'>  Slain by himself, shall enter endless night.</a>
<a id='line_1374'>  And all these four be fools, but mighty men,</a>
<a id='line_1375'>  And therefore am I come for Lancelot.'</a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'>     Hereat Sir Gareth called from where he rose,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>  A head with kindling eyes above the throng,</a>
<a id='line_1379'>  'A boon, Sir King--this quest!' then--for he marked</a>
<a id='line_1380'>  Kay near him groaning like a wounded bull--</a>
<a id='line_1381'>  'Yea, King, thou knowest thy kitchen-knave am I,</a>
<a id='line_1382'>  And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I,</a>
<a id='line_1383'>  And I can topple over a hundred such.</a>
<a id='line_1384'>  Thy promise, King,' and Arthur glancing at him,</a>
<a id='line_1385'>  Brought down a momentary brow.  'Rough, sudden,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>  And pardonable, worthy to be knight--</a>
<a id='line_1387'>  Go therefore,' and all hearers were amazed.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>     But on the damsel's forehead shame, pride, wrath</a>
<a id='line_1390'>  Slew the May-white:  she lifted either arm,</a>
<a id='line_1391'>  'Fie on thee, King! I asked for thy chief knight,</a>
<a id='line_1392'>  And thou hast given me but a kitchen-knave.'</a>
<a id='line_1393'>  Then ere a man in hall could stay her, turned,</a>
<a id='line_1394'>  Fled down the lane of access to the King,</a>
<a id='line_1395'>  Took horse, descended the slope street, and past</a>
<a id='line_1396'>  The weird white gate, and paused without, beside</a>
<a id='line_1397'>  The field of tourney, murmuring 'kitchen-knave.'</a>
<a id='line_1398'></a>
<a id='line_1399'>     Now two great entries opened from the hall,</a>
<a id='line_1400'>  At one end one, that gave upon a range</a>
<a id='line_1401'>  Of level pavement where the King would pace</a>
<a id='line_1402'>  At sunrise, gazing over plain and wood;</a>
<a id='line_1403'>  And down from this a lordly stairway sloped</a>
<a id='line_1404'>  Till lost in blowing trees and tops of towers;</a>
<a id='line_1405'>  And out by this main doorway past the King.</a>
<a id='line_1406'>  But one was counter to the hearth, and rose</a>
<a id='line_1407'>  High that the highest-crested helm could ride</a>
<a id='line_1408'>  Therethrough nor graze:  and by this entry fled</a>
<a id='line_1409'>  The damsel in her wrath, and on to this</a>
<a id='line_1410'>  Sir Gareth strode, and saw without the door</a>
<a id='line_1411'>  King Arthur's gift, the worth of half a town,</a>
<a id='line_1412'>  A warhorse of the best, and near it stood</a>
<a id='line_1413'>  The two that out of north had followed him:</a>
<a id='line_1414'>  This bare a maiden shield, a casque; that held</a>
<a id='line_1415'>  The horse, the spear; whereat Sir Gareth loosed</a>
<a id='line_1416'>  A cloak that dropt from collar-bone to heel,</a>
<a id='line_1417'>  A cloth of roughest web, and cast it down,</a>
<a id='line_1418'>  And from it like a fuel-smothered fire,</a>
<a id='line_1419'>  That lookt half-dead, brake bright, and flashed as those</a>
<a id='line_1420'>  Dull-coated things, that making slide apart</a>
<a id='line_1421'>  Their dusk wing-cases, all beneath there burns</a>
<a id='line_1422'>  A jewelled harness, ere they pass and fly.</a>
<a id='line_1423'>  So Gareth ere he parted flashed in arms.</a>
<a id='line_1424'>  Then as he donned the helm, and took the shield</a>
<a id='line_1425'>  And mounted horse and graspt a spear, of grain</a>
<a id='line_1426'>  Storm-strengthened on a windy site, and tipt</a>
<a id='line_1427'>  With trenchant steel, around him slowly prest</a>
<a id='line_1428'>  The people, while from out of kitchen came</a>
<a id='line_1429'>  The thralls in throng, and seeing who had worked</a>
<a id='line_1430'>  Lustier than any, and whom they could but love,</a>
<a id='line_1431'>  Mounted in arms, threw up their caps and cried,</a>
<a id='line_1432'>  'God bless the King, and all his fellowship!'</a>
<a id='line_1433'>  And on through lanes of shouting Gareth rode</a>
<a id='line_1434'>  Down the slope street, and past without the gate.</a>
<a id='line_1435'></a>
<a id='line_1436'>     So Gareth past with joy; but as the cur</a>
<a id='line_1437'>  Pluckt from the cur he fights with, ere his cause</a>
<a id='line_1438'>  Be cooled by fighting, follows, being named,</a>
<a id='line_1439'>  His owner, but remembers all, and growls</a>
<a id='line_1440'>  Remembering, so Sir Kay beside the door</a>
<a id='line_1441'>  Muttered in scorn of Gareth whom he used</a>
<a id='line_1442'>  To harry and hustle.</a>
<a id='line_1443'></a>
<a id='line_1444'>                      'Bound upon a quest</a>
<a id='line_1445'>  With horse and arms--the King hath past his time--</a>
<a id='line_1446'>  My scullion knave!  Thralls to your work again,</a>
<a id='line_1447'>  For an your fire be low ye kindle mine!</a>
<a id='line_1448'>  Will there be dawn in West and eve in East?</a>
<a id='line_1449'>  Begone!--my knave!--belike and like enow</a>
<a id='line_1450'>  Some old head-blow not heeded in his youth</a>
<a id='line_1451'>  So shook his wits they wander in his prime--</a>
<a id='line_1452'>  Crazed!  How the villain lifted up his voice,</a>
<a id='line_1453'>  Nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchen-knave.</a>
<a id='line_1454'>  Tut:  he was tame and meek enow with me,</a>
<a id='line_1455'>  Till peacocked up with Lancelot's noticing.</a>
<a id='line_1456'>  Well--I will after my loud knave, and learn</a>
<a id='line_1457'>  Whether he know me for his master yet.</a>
<a id='line_1458'>  Out of the smoke he came, and so my lance</a>
<a id='line_1459'>  Hold, by God's grace, he shall into the mire--</a>
<a id='line_1460'>  Thence, if the King awaken from his craze,</a>
<a id='line_1461'>  Into the smoke again.'</a>
<a id='line_1462'></a>
<a id='line_1463'>                        But Lancelot said,</a>
<a id='line_1464'>  'Kay, wherefore wilt thou go against the King,</a>
<a id='line_1465'>  For that did never he whereon ye rail,</a>
<a id='line_1466'>  But ever meekly served the King in thee?</a>
<a id='line_1467'>  Abide:  take counsel; for this lad is great</a>
<a id='line_1468'>  And lusty, and knowing both of lance and sword.'</a>
<a id='line_1469'>  'Tut, tell not me,' said Kay, 'ye are overfine</a>
<a id='line_1470'>  To mar stout knaves with foolish courtesies:'</a>
<a id='line_1471'>  Then mounted, on through silent faces rode</a>
<a id='line_1472'>  Down the slope city, and out beyond the gate.</a>
<a id='line_1473'></a>
<a id='line_1474'>     But by the field of tourney lingering yet</a>
<a id='line_1475'>  Muttered the damsel, 'Wherefore did the King</a>
<a id='line_1476'>  Scorn me? for, were Sir Lancelot lackt, at least</a>
<a id='line_1477'>  He might have yielded to me one of those</a>
<a id='line_1478'>  Who tilt for lady's love and glory here,</a>
<a id='line_1479'>  Rather than--O sweet heaven!  O fie upon him--</a>
<a id='line_1480'>  His kitchen-knave.'</a>
<a id='line_1481'></a>
<a id='line_1482'>                     To whom Sir Gareth drew</a>
<a id='line_1483'>  (And there were none but few goodlier than he)</a>
<a id='line_1484'>  Shining in arms, 'Damsel, the quest is mine.</a>
<a id='line_1485'>  Lead, and I follow.'  She thereat, as one</a>
<a id='line_1486'>  That smells a foul-fleshed agaric in the holt,</a>
<a id='line_1487'>  And deems it carrion of some woodland thing,</a>
<a id='line_1488'>  Or shrew, or weasel, nipt her slender nose</a>
<a id='line_1489'>  With petulant thumb and finger, shrilling, 'Hence!</a>
<a id='line_1490'>  Avoid, thou smellest all of kitchen-grease.</a>
<a id='line_1491'>  And look who comes behind,' for there was Kay.</a>
<a id='line_1492'>  'Knowest thou not me? thy master? I am Kay.</a>
<a id='line_1493'>  We lack thee by the hearth.'</a>
<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>                              And Gareth to him,</a>
<a id='line_1496'>  'Master no more! too well I know thee, ay--</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  The most ungentle knight in Arthur's hall.'</a>
<a id='line_1498'>  'Have at thee then,' said Kay:  they shocked, and Kay</a>
<a id='line_1499'>  Fell shoulder-slipt, and Gareth cried again,</a>
<a id='line_1500'>  'Lead, and I follow,' and fast away she fled.</a>
<a id='line_1501'></a>
<a id='line_1502'>     But after sod and shingle ceased to fly</a>
<a id='line_1503'>  Behind her, and the heart of her good horse</a>
<a id='line_1504'>  Was nigh to burst with violence of the beat,</a>
<a id='line_1505'>  Perforce she stayed, and overtaken spoke.</a>
<a id='line_1506'></a>
<a id='line_1507'>     'What doest thou, scullion, in my fellowship?</a>
<a id='line_1508'>  Deem'st thou that I accept thee aught the more</a>
<a id='line_1509'>  Or love thee better, that by some device</a>
<a id='line_1510'>  Full cowardly, or by mere unhappiness,</a>
<a id='line_1511'>  Thou hast overthrown and slain thy master--thou!--</a>
<a id='line_1512'>  Dish-washer and broach-turner, loon!--to me</a>
<a id='line_1513'>  Thou smellest all of kitchen as before.'</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>     'Damsel,' Sir Gareth answered gently, 'say</a>
<a id='line_1516'>  Whate'er ye will, but whatsoe'er ye say,</a>
<a id='line_1517'>  I leave not till I finish this fair quest,</a>
<a id='line_1518'>  Or die therefore.'</a>
<a id='line_1519'></a>
<a id='line_1520'>                    'Ay, wilt thou finish it?</a>
<a id='line_1521'>  Sweet lord, how like a noble knight he talks!</a>
<a id='line_1522'>  The listening rogue hath caught the manner of it.</a>
<a id='line_1523'>  But, knave, anon thou shalt be met with, knave,</a>
<a id='line_1524'>  And then by such a one that thou for all</a>
<a id='line_1525'>  The kitchen brewis that was ever supt</a>
<a id='line_1526'>  Shalt not once dare to look him in the face.'</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>     'I shall assay,' said Gareth with a smile</a>
<a id='line_1529'>  That maddened her, and away she flashed again</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  Down the long avenues of a boundless wood,</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  And Gareth following was again beknaved.</a>
<a id='line_1532'></a>
<a id='line_1533'>     'Sir Kitchen-knave, I have missed the only way</a>
<a id='line_1534'>  Where Arthur's men are set along the wood;</a>
<a id='line_1535'>  The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves:</a>
<a id='line_1536'>  If both be slain, I am rid of thee; but yet,</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  Sir Scullion, canst thou use that spit of thine?</a>
<a id='line_1538'>  Fight, an thou canst:  I have missed the only way.'</a>
<a id='line_1539'></a>
<a id='line_1540'>     So till the dusk that followed evensong</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  Rode on the two, reviler and reviled;</a>
<a id='line_1542'>  Then after one long slope was mounted, saw,</a>
<a id='line_1543'>  Bowl-shaped, through tops of many thousand pines</a>
<a id='line_1544'>  A gloomy-gladed hollow slowly sink</a>
<a id='line_1545'>  To westward--in the deeps whereof a mere,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>  Round as the red eye of an Eagle-owl,</a>
<a id='line_1547'>  Under the half-dead sunset glared; and shouts</a>
<a id='line_1548'>  Ascended, and there brake a servingman</a>
<a id='line_1549'>  Flying from out of the black wood, and crying,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>  'They have bound my lord to cast him in the mere.'</a>
<a id='line_1551'>  Then Gareth, 'Bound am I to right the wronged,</a>
<a id='line_1552'>  But straitlier bound am I to bide with thee.'</a>
<a id='line_1553'>  And when the damsel spake contemptuously,</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  'Lead, and I follow,' Gareth cried again,</a>
<a id='line_1555'>  'Follow, I lead!' so down among the pines</a>
<a id='line_1556'>  He plunged; and there, blackshadowed nigh the mere,</a>
<a id='line_1557'>  And mid-thigh-deep in bulrushes and reed,</a>
<a id='line_1558'>  Saw six tall men haling a seventh along,</a>
<a id='line_1559'>  A stone about his neck to drown him in it.</a>
<a id='line_1560'>  Three with good blows he quieted, but three</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  Fled through the pines; and Gareth loosed the stone</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  From off his neck, then in the mere beside</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  Tumbled it; oilily bubbled up the mere.</a>
<a id='line_1564'>  Last, Gareth loosed his bonds and on free feet</a>
<a id='line_1565'>  Set him, a stalwart Baron, Arthur's friend.</a>
<a id='line_1566'></a>
<a id='line_1567'>     'Well that ye came, or else these caitiff rogues</a>
<a id='line_1568'>  Had wreaked themselves on me; good cause is theirs</a>
<a id='line_1569'>  To hate me, for my wont hath ever been</a>
<a id='line_1570'>  To catch my thief, and then like vermin here</a>
<a id='line_1571'>  Drown him, and with a stone about his neck;</a>
<a id='line_1572'>  And under this wan water many of them</a>
<a id='line_1573'>  Lie rotting, but at night let go the stone,</a>
<a id='line_1574'>  And rise, and flickering in a grimly light</a>
<a id='line_1575'>  Dance on the mere.  Good now, ye have saved a life</a>
<a id='line_1576'>  Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood.</a>
<a id='line_1577'>  And fain would I reward thee worshipfully.</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  What guerdon will ye?'</a>
<a id='line_1579'>                        Gareth sharply spake,</a>
<a id='line_1580'>  'None! for the deed's sake have I done the deed,</a>
<a id='line_1581'>  In uttermost obedience to the King.</a>
<a id='line_1582'>  But wilt thou yield this damsel harbourage?'</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>     Whereat the Baron saying, 'I well believe</a>
<a id='line_1585'>  You be of Arthur's Table,' a light laugh</a>
<a id='line_1586'>  Broke from Lynette, 'Ay, truly of a truth,</a>
<a id='line_1587'>  And in a sort, being Arthur's kitchen-knave!--</a>
<a id='line_1588'>  But deem not I accept thee aught the more,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>  Scullion, for running sharply with thy spit</a>
<a id='line_1590'>  Down on a rout of craven foresters.</a>
<a id='line_1591'>  A thresher with his flail had scattered them.</a>
<a id='line_1592'>  Nay--for thou smellest of the kitchen still.</a>
<a id='line_1593'>  But an this lord will yield us harbourage,</a>
<a id='line_1594'>  Well.'</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>        So she spake.  A league beyond the wood,</a>
<a id='line_1597'>  All in a full-fair manor and a rich,</a>
<a id='line_1598'>  His towers where that day a feast had been</a>
<a id='line_1599'>  Held in high hall, and many a viand left,</a>
<a id='line_1600'>  And many a costly cate, received the three.</a>
<a id='line_1601'>  And there they placed a peacock in his pride</a>
<a id='line_1602'>  Before the damsel, and the Baron set</a>
<a id='line_1603'>  Gareth beside her, but at once she rose.</a>
<a id='line_1604'></a>
<a id='line_1605'>     'Meseems, that here is much discourtesy,</a>
<a id='line_1606'>  Setting this knave, Lord Baron, at my side.</a>
<a id='line_1607'>  Hear me--this morn I stood in Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_1608'>  And prayed the King would grant me Lancelot</a>
<a id='line_1609'>  To fight the brotherhood of Day and Night--</a>
<a id='line_1610'>  The last a monster unsubduable</a>
<a id='line_1611'>  Of any save of him for whom I called--</a>
<a id='line_1612'>  Suddenly bawls this frontless kitchen-knave,</a>
<a id='line_1613'>  "The quest is mine; thy kitchen-knave am I,</a>
<a id='line_1614'>  And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I."</a>
<a id='line_1615'>  Then Arthur all at once gone mad replies,</a>
<a id='line_1616'>  "Go therefore," and so gives the quest to him--</a>
<a id='line_1617'>  Him--here--a villain fitter to stick swine</a>
<a id='line_1618'>  Than ride abroad redressing women's wrong,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>  Or sit beside a noble gentlewoman.'</a>
<a id='line_1620'></a>
<a id='line_1621'>     Then half-ashamed and part-amazed, the lord</a>
<a id='line_1622'>  Now looked at one and now at other, left</a>
<a id='line_1623'>  The damsel by the peacock in his pride,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>  And, seating Gareth at another board,</a>
<a id='line_1625'>  Sat down beside him, ate and then began.</a>
<a id='line_1626'></a>
<a id='line_1627'>     'Friend, whether thou be kitchen-knave, or not,</a>
<a id='line_1628'>  Or whether it be the maiden's fantasy,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>  And whether she be mad, or else the King,</a>
<a id='line_1630'>  Or both or neither, or thyself be mad,</a>
<a id='line_1631'>  I ask not:  but thou strikest a strong stroke,</a>
<a id='line_1632'>  For strong thou art and goodly therewithal,</a>
<a id='line_1633'>  And saver of my life; and therefore now,</a>
<a id='line_1634'>  For here be mighty men to joust with, weigh</a>
<a id='line_1635'>  Whether thou wilt not with thy damsel back</a>
<a id='line_1636'>  To crave again Sir Lancelot of the King.</a>
<a id='line_1637'>  Thy pardon; I but speak for thine avail,</a>
<a id='line_1638'>  The saver of my life.'</a>
<a id='line_1639'></a>
<a id='line_1640'>                        And Gareth said,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>  'Full pardon, but I follow up the quest,</a>
<a id='line_1642'>  Despite of Day and Night and Death and Hell.'</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>     So when, next morn, the lord whose life he saved</a>
<a id='line_1645'>  Had, some brief space, conveyed them on their way</a>
<a id='line_1646'>  And left them with God-speed, Sir Gareth spake,</a>
<a id='line_1647'>  'Lead, and I follow.'  Haughtily she replied.</a>
<a id='line_1648'></a>
<a id='line_1649'>     'I fly no more:  I allow thee for an hour.</a>
<a id='line_1650'>  Lion and stout have isled together, knave,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>  In time of flood.  Nay, furthermore, methinks</a>
<a id='line_1652'>  Some ruth is mine for thee.  Back wilt thou, fool?</a>
<a id='line_1653'>  For hard by here is one will overthrow</a>
<a id='line_1654'>  And slay thee:  then will I to court again,</a>
<a id='line_1655'>  And shame the King for only yielding me</a>
<a id='line_1656'>  My champion from the ashes of his hearth.'</a>
<a id='line_1657'></a>
<a id='line_1658'>     To whom Sir Gareth answered courteously,</a>
<a id='line_1659'>  'Say thou thy say, and I will do my deed.</a>
<a id='line_1660'>  Allow me for mine hour, and thou wilt find</a>
<a id='line_1661'>  My fortunes all as fair as hers who lay</a>
<a id='line_1662'>  Among the ashes and wedded the King's son.'</a>
<a id='line_1663'></a>
<a id='line_1664'>     Then to the shore of one of those long loops</a>
<a id='line_1665'>  Wherethrough the serpent river coiled, they came.</a>
<a id='line_1666'>  Rough-thicketed were the banks and steep; the stream</a>
<a id='line_1667'>  Full, narrow; this a bridge of single arc</a>
<a id='line_1668'>  Took at a leap; and on the further side</a>
<a id='line_1669'>  Arose a silk pavilion, gay with gold</a>
<a id='line_1670'>  In streaks and rays, and all Lent-lily in hue,</a>
<a id='line_1671'>  Save that the dome was purple, and above,</a>
<a id='line_1672'>  Crimson, a slender banneret fluttering.</a>
<a id='line_1673'>  And therebefore the lawless warrior paced</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  Unarmed, and calling, 'Damsel, is this he,</a>
<a id='line_1675'>  The champion thou hast brought from Arthur's hall?</a>
<a id='line_1676'>  For whom we let thee pass.'  'Nay, nay,' she said,</a>
<a id='line_1677'>  'Sir Morning-Star.  The King in utter scorn</a>
<a id='line_1678'>  Of thee and thy much folly hath sent thee here</a>
<a id='line_1679'>  His kitchen-knave:  and look thou to thyself:</a>
<a id='line_1680'>  See that he fall not on thee suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_1681'>  And slay thee unarmed:  he is not knight but knave.'</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>     Then at his call, 'O daughters of the Dawn,</a>
<a id='line_1684'>  And servants of the Morning-Star, approach,</a>
<a id='line_1685'>  Arm me,' from out the silken curtain-folds</a>
<a id='line_1686'>  Bare-footed and bare-headed three fair girls</a>
<a id='line_1687'>  In gilt and rosy raiment came:  their feet</a>
<a id='line_1688'>  In dewy grasses glistened; and the hair</a>
<a id='line_1689'>  All over glanced with dewdrop or with gem</a>
<a id='line_1690'>  Like sparkles in the stone Avanturine.</a>
<a id='line_1691'>  These armed him in blue arms, and gave a shield</a>
<a id='line_1692'>  Blue also, and thereon the morning star.</a>
<a id='line_1693'>  And Gareth silent gazed upon the knight,</a>
<a id='line_1694'>  Who stood a moment, ere his horse was brought,</a>
<a id='line_1695'>  Glorying; and in the stream beneath him, shone</a>
<a id='line_1696'>  Immingled with Heaven's azure waveringly,</a>
<a id='line_1697'>  The gay pavilion and the naked feet,</a>
<a id='line_1698'>  His arms, the rosy raiment, and the star.</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>     Then she that watched him, 'Wherefore stare ye so?</a>
<a id='line_1701'>  Thou shakest in thy fear:  there yet is time:</a>
<a id='line_1702'>  Flee down the valley before he get to horse.</a>
<a id='line_1703'>  Who will cry shame?  Thou art not knight but knave.'</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>     Said Gareth, 'Damsel, whether knave or knight,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>  Far liefer had I fight a score of times</a>
<a id='line_1707'>  Than hear thee so missay me and revile.</a>
<a id='line_1708'>  Fair words were best for him who fights for thee;</a>
<a id='line_1709'>  But truly foul are better, for they send</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  That strength of anger through mine arms, I know</a>
<a id='line_1711'>  That I shall overthrow him.'</a>
<a id='line_1712'></a>
<a id='line_1713'>                              And he that bore</a>
<a id='line_1714'>  The star, when mounted, cried from o'er the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_1715'>  'A kitchen-knave, and sent in scorn of me!</a>
<a id='line_1716'>  Such fight not I, but answer scorn with scorn.</a>
<a id='line_1717'>  For this were shame to do him further wrong</a>
<a id='line_1718'>  Than set him on his feet, and take his horse</a>
<a id='line_1719'>  And arms, and so return him to the King.</a>
<a id='line_1720'>  Come, therefore, leave thy lady lightly, knave.</a>
<a id='line_1721'>  Avoid:  for it beseemeth not a knave</a>
<a id='line_1722'>  To ride with such a lady.'</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>                            'Dog, thou liest.</a>
<a id='line_1725'>  I spring from loftier lineage than thine own.'</a>
<a id='line_1726'>  He spake; and all at fiery speed the two</a>
<a id='line_1727'>  Shocked on the central bridge, and either spear</a>
<a id='line_1728'>  Bent but not brake, and either knight at once,</a>
<a id='line_1729'>  Hurled as a stone from out of a catapult</a>
<a id='line_1730'>  Beyond his horse's crupper and the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>  Fell, as if dead; but quickly rose and drew,</a>
<a id='line_1732'>  And Gareth lashed so fiercely with his brand</a>
<a id='line_1733'>  He drave his enemy backward down the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>  The damsel crying, 'Well-stricken, kitchen-knave!'</a>
<a id='line_1735'>  Till Gareth's shield was cloven; but one stroke</a>
<a id='line_1736'>  Laid him that clove it grovelling on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1737'></a>
<a id='line_1738'>     Then cried the fallen, 'Take not my life:  I yield.'</a>
<a id='line_1739'>  And Gareth, 'So this damsel ask it of me</a>
<a id='line_1740'>  Good--I accord it easily as a grace.'</a>
<a id='line_1741'>  She reddening, 'Insolent scullion:  I of thee?</a>
<a id='line_1742'>  I bound to thee for any favour asked!'</a>
<a id='line_1743'>  'Then he shall die.'  And Gareth there unlaced</a>
<a id='line_1744'>  His helmet as to slay him, but she shrieked,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>  'Be not so hardy, scullion, as to slay</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  One nobler than thyself.'  'Damsel, thy charge</a>
<a id='line_1747'>  Is an abounding pleasure to me.  Knight,</a>
<a id='line_1748'>  Thy life is thine at her command.  Arise</a>
<a id='line_1749'>  And quickly pass to Arthur's hall, and say</a>
<a id='line_1750'>  His kitchen-knave hath sent thee.  See thou crave</a>
<a id='line_1751'>  His pardon for thy breaking of his laws.</a>
<a id='line_1752'>  Myself, when I return, will plead for thee.</a>
<a id='line_1753'>  Thy shield is mine--farewell; and, damsel, thou,</a>
<a id='line_1754'>  Lead, and I follow.'</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>                      And fast away she fled.</a>
<a id='line_1757'>  Then when he came upon her, spake, 'Methought,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>  Knave, when I watched thee striking on the bridge</a>
<a id='line_1759'>  The savour of thy kitchen came upon me</a>
<a id='line_1760'>  A little faintlier:  but the wind hath changed:</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  I scent it twenty-fold.'  And then she sang,</a>
<a id='line_1762'>  '"O morning star" (not that tall felon there</a>
<a id='line_1763'>  Whom thou by sorcery or unhappiness</a>
<a id='line_1764'>  Or some device, hast foully overthrown),</a>
<a id='line_1765'>  "O morning star that smilest in the blue,</a>
<a id='line_1766'>  O star, my morning dream hath proven true,</a>
<a id='line_1767'>  Smile sweetly, thou! my love hath smiled on me."</a>
<a id='line_1768'></a>
<a id='line_1769'>     'But thou begone, take counsel, and away,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>  For hard by here is one that guards a ford--</a>
<a id='line_1771'>  The second brother in their fool's parable--</a>
<a id='line_1772'>  Will pay thee all thy wages, and to boot.</a>
<a id='line_1773'>  Care not for shame:  thou art not knight but knave.'</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>     To whom Sir Gareth answered, laughingly,</a>
<a id='line_1776'>  'Parables?  Hear a parable of the knave.</a>
<a id='line_1777'>  When I was kitchen-knave among the rest</a>
<a id='line_1778'>  Fierce was the hearth, and one of my co-mates</a>
<a id='line_1779'>  Owned a rough dog, to whom he cast his coat,</a>
<a id='line_1780'>  "Guard it," and there was none to meddle with it.</a>
<a id='line_1781'>  And such a coat art thou, and thee the King</a>
<a id='line_1782'>  Gave me to guard, and such a dog am I,</a>
<a id='line_1783'>  To worry, and not to flee--and--knight or knave--</a>
<a id='line_1784'>  The knave that doth thee service as full knight</a>
<a id='line_1785'>  Is all as good, meseems, as any knight</a>
<a id='line_1786'>  Toward thy sister's freeing.'</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>                               'Ay, Sir Knave!</a>
<a id='line_1789'>  Ay, knave, because thou strikest as a knight,</a>
<a id='line_1790'>  Being but knave, I hate thee all the more.'</a>
<a id='line_1791'></a>
<a id='line_1792'>     'Fair damsel, you should worship me the more,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>  That, being but knave, I throw thine enemies.'</a>
<a id='line_1794'></a>
<a id='line_1795'>     'Ay, ay,' she said, 'but thou shalt meet thy match.'</a>
<a id='line_1796'></a>
<a id='line_1797'>     So when they touched the second river-loop,</a>
<a id='line_1798'>  Huge on a huge red horse, and all in mail</a>
<a id='line_1799'>  Burnished to blinding, shone the Noonday Sun</a>
<a id='line_1800'>  Beyond a raging shallow.  As if the flower,</a>
<a id='line_1801'>  That blows a globe of after arrowlets,</a>
<a id='line_1802'>  Ten thousand-fold had grown, flashed the fierce shield,</a>
<a id='line_1803'>  All sun; and Gareth's eyes had flying blots</a>
<a id='line_1804'>  Before them when he turned from watching him.</a>
<a id='line_1805'>  He from beyond the roaring shallow roared,</a>
<a id='line_1806'>  'What doest thou, brother, in my marches here?'</a>
<a id='line_1807'>  And she athwart the shallow shrilled again,</a>
<a id='line_1808'>  'Here is a kitchen-knave from Arthur's hall</a>
<a id='line_1809'>  Hath overthrown thy brother, and hath his arms.'</a>
<a id='line_1810'>  'Ugh!' cried the Sun, and vizoring up a red</a>
<a id='line_1811'>  And cipher face of rounded foolishness,</a>
<a id='line_1812'>  Pushed horse across the foamings of the ford,</a>
<a id='line_1813'>  Whom Gareth met midstream:  no room was there</a>
<a id='line_1814'>  For lance or tourney-skill:  four strokes they struck</a>
<a id='line_1815'>  With sword, and these were mighty; the new knight</a>
<a id='line_1816'>  Had fear he might be shamed; but as the Sun</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  Heaved up a ponderous arm to strike the fifth,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>  The hoof of his horse slipt in the stream, the stream</a>
<a id='line_1819'>  Descended, and the Sun was washed away.</a>
<a id='line_1820'></a>
<a id='line_1821'>     Then Gareth laid his lance athwart the ford;</a>
<a id='line_1822'>  So drew him home; but he that fought no more,</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  As being all bone-battered on the rock,</a>
<a id='line_1824'>  Yielded; and Gareth sent him to the King,</a>
<a id='line_1825'>  'Myself when I return will plead for thee.'</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  'Lead, and I follow.'  Quietly she led.</a>
<a id='line_1827'>  'Hath not the good wind, damsel, changed again?'</a>
<a id='line_1828'>  'Nay, not a point:  nor art thou victor here.</a>
<a id='line_1829'>  There lies a ridge of slate across the ford;</a>
<a id='line_1830'>  His horse thereon stumbled--ay, for I saw it.</a>

<a id='line_1891'>  But that same strength which threw the Morning Star</a>
<a id='line_1892'>  Can throw the Evening.'</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>                         Then that other blew</a>
<a id='line_1895'>  A hard and deadly note upon the horn.</a>
<a id='line_1896'>  'Approach and arm me!'  With slow steps from out</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  An old storm-beaten, russet, many-stained</a>
<a id='line_1898'>  Pavilion, forth a grizzled damsel came,</a>
<a id='line_1899'>  And armed him in old arms, and brought a helm</a>
<a id='line_1900'>  With but a drying evergreen for crest,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>  And gave a shield whereon the Star of Even</a>
<a id='line_1902'>  Half-tarnished and half-bright, his emblem, shone.</a>
<a id='line_1903'>  But when it glittered o'er the saddle-bow,</a>
<a id='line_1904'>  They madly hurled together on the bridge;</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  And Gareth overthrew him, lighted, drew,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  There met him drawn, and overthrew him again,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  But up like fire he started:  and as oft</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  As Gareth brought him grovelling on his knees,</a>
<a id='line_1909'>  So many a time he vaulted up again;</a>
<a id='line_1910'>  Till Gareth panted hard, and his great heart,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>  Foredooming all his trouble was in vain,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  Laboured within him, for he seemed as one</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  That all in later, sadder age begins</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  To war against ill uses of a life,</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  But these from all his life arise, and cry,</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  'Thou hast made us lords, and canst not put us down!'</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  He half despairs; so Gareth seemed to strike</a>
<a id='line_1918'>  Vainly, the damsel clamouring all the while,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>  'Well done, knave-knight, well-stricken, O good knight-knave--</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  O knave, as noble as any of all the knights--</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  Shame me not, shame me not.  I have prophesied--</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  Strike, thou art worthy of the Table Round--</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  His arms are old, he trusts the hardened skin--</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  Strike--strike--the wind will never change again.'</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  And Gareth hearing ever stronglier smote,</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  And hewed great pieces of his armour off him,</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  But lashed in vain against the hardened skin,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  And could not wholly bring him under, more</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  Than loud Southwesterns, rolling ridge on ridge,</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  The buoy that rides at sea, and dips and springs</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  For ever; till at length Sir Gareth's brand</a>
<a id='line_1932'>  Clashed his, and brake it utterly to the hilt.</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  'I have thee now;' but forth that other sprang,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>  And, all unknightlike, writhed his wiry arms</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  Around him, till he felt, despite his mail,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>  Strangled, but straining even his uttermost</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  Cast, and so hurled him headlong o'er the bridge</a>
<a id='line_1938'>  Down to the river, sink or swim, and cried,</a>
<a id='line_1939'>  'Lead, and I follow.'</a>
<a id='line_1940'></a>
<a id='line_1941'>                       But the damsel said,</a>
<a id='line_1942'>  'I lead no longer; ride thou at my side;</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  Thou art the kingliest of all kitchen-knaves.</a>
<a id='line_1944'></a>
<a id='line_1945'>     '"O trefoil, sparkling on the rainy plain,</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  O rainbow with three colours after rain,</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  Shine sweetly:  thrice my love hath smiled on me."</a>
<a id='line_1948'></a>
<a id='line_1949'>     'Sir,--and, good faith, I fain had added--Knight,</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  But that I heard thee call thyself a knave,--</a>
<a id='line_1951'>  Shamed am I that I so rebuked, reviled,</a>
<a id='line_1952'>  Missaid thee; noble I am; and thought the King</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  Scorned me and mine; and now thy pardon, friend,</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  For thou hast ever answered courteously,</a>
<a id='line_1955'>  And wholly bold thou art, and meek withal</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  As any of Arthur's best, but, being knave,</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  Hast mazed my wit:  I marvel what thou art.'</a>
<a id='line_1958'></a>
<a id='line_1959'>     'Damsel,' he said, 'you be not all to blame,</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  Saving that you mistrusted our good King</a>
<a id='line_1961'>  Would handle scorn, or yield you, asking, one</a>
<a id='line_1962'>  Not fit to cope your quest.  You said your say;</a>
<a id='line_1963'>  Mine answer was my deed.  Good sooth!  I hold</a>
<a id='line_1964'>  He scarce is knight, yea but half-man, nor meet</a>
<a id='line_1965'>  To fight for gentle damsel, he, who lets</a>
<a id='line_1966'>  His heart be stirred with any foolish heat</a>
<a id='line_1967'>  At any gentle damsel's waywardness.</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  Shamed? care not! thy foul sayings fought for me:</a>
<a id='line_1969'>  And seeing now thy words are fair, methinks</a>
<a id='line_1970'>  There rides no knight, not Lancelot, his great self,</a>
<a id='line_1971'>  Hath force to quell me.'</a>
<a id='line_1972'>                          Nigh upon that hour</a>
<a id='line_1973'>  When the lone hern forgets his melancholy,</a>
<a id='line_1974'>  Lets down his other leg, and stretching, dreams</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  Of goodly supper in the distant pool,</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  Then turned the noble damsel smiling at him,</a>
<a id='line_1977'>  And told him of a cavern hard at hand,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>  Where bread and baken meats and good red wine</a>
<a id='line_1979'>  Of Southland, which the Lady Lyonors</a>
<a id='line_1980'>  Had sent her coming champion, waited him.</a>
<a id='line_1981'></a>
<a id='line_1982'>     Anon they past a narrow comb wherein</a>
<a id='line_1983'>  Where slabs of rock with figures, knights on horse</a>
<a id='line_1984'>  Sculptured, and deckt in slowly-waning hues.</a>
<a id='line_1985'>  'Sir Knave, my knight, a hermit once was here,</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  Whose holy hand hath fashioned on the rock</a>
<a id='line_1987'>  The war of Time against the soul of man.</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  And yon four fools have sucked their allegory</a>
<a id='line_1989'>  From these damp walls, and taken but the form.</a>
<a id='line_1990'>  Know ye not these?' and Gareth lookt and read--</a>
<a id='line_1991'>  In letters like to those the vexillary</a>
<a id='line_1992'>  Hath left crag-carven o'er the streaming Gelt--</a>
<a id='line_1993'>  'PHOSPHORUS,' then 'MERIDIES'--'HESPERUS'--</a>
<a id='line_1994'>  'NOX'--'MORS,' beneath five figures, armed men,</a>
<a id='line_1995'>  Slab after slab, their faces forward all,</a>
<a id='line_1996'>  And running down the Soul, a Shape that fled</a>
<a id='line_1997'>  With broken wings, torn raiment and loose hair,</a>
<a id='line_1998'>  For help and shelter to the hermit's cave.</a>
<a id='line_1999'>  'Follow the faces, and we find it.  Look,</a>
<a id='line_2000'>  Who comes behind?'</a>
<a id='line_2001'></a>
<a id='line_2002'>                    For one--delayed at first</a>
<a id='line_2003'>  Through helping back the dislocated Kay</a>
<a id='line_2004'>  To Camelot, then by what thereafter chanced,</a>
<a id='line_2005'>  The damsel's headlong error through the wood--</a>
<a id='line_2006'>  Sir Lancelot, having swum the river-loops--</a>
<a id='line_2007'>  His blue shield-lions covered--softly drew</a>
<a id='line_2008'>  Behind the twain, and when he saw the star</a>
<a id='line_2009'>  Gleam, on Sir Gareth's turning to him, cried,</a>
<a id='line_2010'>  'Stay, felon knight, I avenge me for my friend.'</a>
<a id='line_2011'>  And Gareth crying pricked against the cry;</a>
<a id='line_2012'>  But when they closed--in a moment--at one touch</a>
<a id='line_2013'>  Of that skilled spear, the wonder of the world--</a>
<a id='line_2014'>  Went sliding down so easily, and fell,</a>
<a id='line_2015'>  That when he found the grass within his hands</a>
<a id='line_2016'>  He laughed; the laughter jarred upon Lynette:</a>
<a id='line_2017'>  Harshly she asked him, 'Shamed and overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_2018'>  And tumbled back into the kitchen-knave,</a>
<a id='line_2019'>  Why laugh ye? that ye blew your boast in vain?'</a>
<a id='line_2020'>  'Nay, noble damsel, but that I, the son</a>
<a id='line_2021'>  Of old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent,</a>
<a id='line_2022'>  And victor of the bridges and the ford,</a>
<a id='line_2023'>  And knight of Arthur, here lie thrown by whom</a>
<a id='line_2024'>  I know not, all through mere unhappiness--</a>
<a id='line_2025'>  Device and sorcery and unhappiness--</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  Out, sword; we are thrown!'  And Lancelot answered, 'Prince,</a>
<a id='line_2027'>  O Gareth--through the mere unhappiness</a>
<a id='line_2028'>  Of one who came to help thee, not to harm,</a>
<a id='line_2029'>  Lancelot, and all as glad to find thee whole,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>  As on the day when Arthur knighted him.'</a>
<a id='line_2031'></a>
<a id='line_2032'>     Then Gareth, 'Thou--Lancelot!--thine the hand</a>
<a id='line_2033'>  That threw me?  An some chance to mar the boast</a>
<a id='line_2034'>  Thy brethren of thee make--which could not chance--</a>
<a id='line_2035'>  Had sent thee down before a lesser spear,</a>
<a id='line_2036'>  Shamed had I been, and sad--O Lancelot--thou!'</a>
<a id='line_2037'></a>
<a id='line_2038'>     Whereat the maiden, petulant, 'Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_2039'>  Why came ye not, when called? and wherefore now</a>
<a id='line_2040'>  Come ye, not called?  I gloried in my knave,</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  Who being still rebuked, would answer still</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  Courteous as any knight--but now, if knight,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>  The marvel dies, and leaves me fooled and tricked,</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  And only wondering wherefore played upon:</a>
<a id='line_2045'>  And doubtful whether I and mine be scorned.</a>
<a id='line_2046'>  Where should be truth if not in Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_2047'>  In Arthur's presence?  Knight, knave, prince and fool,</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  I hate thee and for ever.'</a>
<a id='line_2049'></a>
<a id='line_2050'>                            And Lancelot said,</a>
<a id='line_2051'>  'Blessed be thou, Sir Gareth! knight art thou</a>
<a id='line_2052'>  To the King's best wish.  O damsel, be you wise</a>
<a id='line_2053'>  To call him shamed, who is but overthrown?</a>
<a id='line_2054'>  Thrown have I been, nor once, but many a time.</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  Victor from vanquished issues at the last,</a>
<a id='line_2056'>  And overthrower from being overthrown.</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  With sword we have not striven; and thy good horse</a>
<a id='line_2058'>  And thou are weary; yet not less I felt</a>
<a id='line_2059'>  Thy manhood through that wearied lance of thine.</a>
<a id='line_2060'>  Well hast thou done; for all the stream is freed,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>  And thou hast wreaked his justice on his foes,</a>
<a id='line_2062'>  And when reviled, hast answered graciously,</a>
<a id='line_2063'>  And makest merry when overthrown.  Prince, Knight</a>
<a id='line_2064'>  Hail, Knight and Prince, and of our Table Round!'</a>
<a id='line_2065'></a>
<a id='line_2066'>     And then when turning to Lynette he told</a>
<a id='line_2067'>  The tale of Gareth, petulantly she said,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>  'Ay well--ay well--for worse than being fooled</a>
<a id='line_2069'>  Of others, is to fool one's self.  A cave,</a>
<a id='line_2070'>  Sir Lancelot, is hard by, with meats and drinks</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  And forage for the horse, and flint for fire.</a>
<a id='line_2072'>  But all about it flies a honeysuckle.</a>
<a id='line_2073'>  Seek, till we find.'  And when they sought and found,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>  Sir Gareth drank and ate, and all his life</a>
<a id='line_2075'>  Past into sleep; on whom the maiden gazed.</a>
<a id='line_2076'>  'Sound sleep be thine! sound cause to sleep hast thou.</a>
<a id='line_2077'>  Wake lusty!  Seem I not as tender to him</a>
<a id='line_2078'>  As any mother?  Ay, but such a one</a>
<a id='line_2079'>  As all day long hath rated at her child,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>  And vext his day, but blesses him asleep--</a>
<a id='line_2081'>  Good lord, how sweetly smells the honeysuckle</a>
<a id='line_2082'>  In the hushed night, as if the world were one</a>
<a id='line_2083'>  Of utter peace, and love, and gentleness!</a>
<a id='line_2084'>  O Lancelot, Lancelot'--and she clapt her hands--</a>
<a id='line_2085'>  'Full merry am I to find my goodly knave</a>
<a id='line_2086'>  Is knight and noble.  See now, sworn have I,</a>
<a id='line_2087'>  Else yon black felon had not let me pass,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>  To bring thee back to do the battle with him.</a>
<a id='line_2089'>  Thus an thou goest, he will fight thee first;</a>
<a id='line_2090'>  Who doubts thee victor? so will my knight-knave</a>
<a id='line_2091'>  Miss the full flower of this accomplishment.'</a>
<a id='line_2092'></a>
<a id='line_2093'>     Said Lancelot, 'Peradventure he, you name,</a>
<a id='line_2094'>  May know my shield.  Let Gareth, an he will,</a>
<a id='line_2095'>  Change his for mine, and take my charger, fresh,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>  Not to be spurred, loving the battle as well</a>
<a id='line_2097'>  As he that rides him.'  'Lancelot-like,' she said,</a>
<a id='line_2098'>  'Courteous in this, Lord Lancelot, as in all.'</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>     And Gareth, wakening, fiercely clutched the shield;</a>
<a id='line_2101'>  'Ramp ye lance-splintering lions, on whom all spears</a>
<a id='line_2102'>  Are rotten sticks! ye seem agape to roar!</a>
<a id='line_2103'>  Yea, ramp and roar at leaving of your lord!--</a>
<a id='line_2104'>  Care not, good beasts, so well I care for you.</a>
<a id='line_2105'>  O noble Lancelot, from my hold on these</a>
<a id='line_2106'>  Streams virtue--fire--through one that will not shame</a>
<a id='line_2107'>  Even the shadow of Lancelot under shield.</a>
<a id='line_2108'>  Hence:  let us go.'</a>
<a id='line_2109'></a>
<a id='line_2110'>                     Silent the silent field</a>
<a id='line_2111'>  They traversed.  Arthur's harp though summer-wan,</a>
<a id='line_2112'>  In counter motion to the clouds, allured</a>
<a id='line_2113'>  The glance of Gareth dreaming on his liege.</a>
<a id='line_2114'>  A star shot:  'Lo,' said Gareth, 'the foe falls!'</a>
<a id='line_2115'>  An owl whoopt:  'Hark the victor pealing there!'</a>
<a id='line_2116'>  Suddenly she that rode upon his left</a>
<a id='line_2117'>  Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying,</a>
<a id='line_2118'>  'Yield, yield him this again:  'tis he must fight:</a>
<a id='line_2119'>  I curse the tongue that all through yesterday</a>
<a id='line_2120'>  Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now</a>
<a id='line_2121'>  To lend thee horse and shield:  wonders ye have done;</a>
<a id='line_2122'>  Miracles ye cannot:  here is glory enow</a>
<a id='line_2123'>  In having flung the three:  I see thee maimed,</a>
<a id='line_2124'>  Mangled:  I swear thou canst not fling the fourth.'</a>
<a id='line_2125'></a>
<a id='line_2126'>     'And wherefore, damsel? tell me all ye know.</a>
<a id='line_2127'>  You cannot scare me; nor rough face, or voice,</a>
<a id='line_2128'>  Brute bulk of limb, or boundless savagery</a>
<a id='line_2129'>  Appal me from the quest.'</a>
<a id='line_2130'></a>
<a id='line_2131'>                           'Nay, Prince,' she cried,</a>
<a id='line_2132'>  'God wot, I never looked upon the face,</a>
<a id='line_2133'>  Seeing he never rides abroad by day;</a>
<a id='line_2134'>  But watched him have I like a phantom pass</a>
<a id='line_2135'>  Chilling the night:  nor have I heard the voice.</a>
<a id='line_2136'>  Always he made his mouthpiece of a page</a>
<a id='line_2137'>  Who came and went, and still reported him</a>
<a id='line_2138'>  As closing in himself the strength of ten,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>  And when his anger tare him, massacring</a>
<a id='line_2140'>  Man, woman, lad and girl--yea, the soft babe!</a>
<a id='line_2141'>  Some hold that he hath swallowed infant flesh,</a>
<a id='line_2142'>  Monster!  O Prince, I went for Lancelot first,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>  The quest is Lancelot's:  give him back the shield.'</a>
<a id='line_2144'></a>
<a id='line_2145'>     Said Gareth laughing, 'An he fight for this,</a>
<a id='line_2146'>  Belike he wins it as the better man:</a>
<a id='line_2147'>  Thus--and not else!'</a>
<a id='line_2148'></a>
<a id='line_2149'>                      But Lancelot on him urged</a>
<a id='line_2150'>  All the devisings of their chivalry</a>
<a id='line_2151'>  When one might meet a mightier than himself;</a>
<a id='line_2152'>  How best to manage horse, lance, sword and shield,</a>
<a id='line_2153'>  And so fill up the gap where force might fail</a>
<a id='line_2154'>  With skill and fineness.  Instant were his words.</a>
<a id='line_2155'></a>
<a id='line_2156'>     Then Gareth, 'Here be rules.  I know but one--</a>
<a id='line_2157'>  To dash against mine enemy and win.</a>
<a id='line_2158'>  Yet have I seen thee victor in the joust,</a>
<a id='line_2159'>  And seen thy way.'  'Heaven help thee,' sighed Lynette.</a>
<a id='line_2160'></a>
<a id='line_2161'>     Then for a space, and under cloud that grew</a>
<a id='line_2162'>  To thunder-gloom palling all stars, they rode</a>
<a id='line_2163'>  In converse till she made her palfrey halt,</a>
<a id='line_2164'>  Lifted an arm, and softly whispered, 'There.'</a>
<a id='line_2165'>  And all the three were silent seeing, pitched</a>
<a id='line_2166'>  Beside the Castle Perilous on flat field,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>  A huge pavilion like a mountain peak</a>
<a id='line_2168'>  Sunder the glooming crimson on the marge,</a>
<a id='line_2169'>  Black, with black banner, and a long black horn</a>
<a id='line_2170'>  Beside it hanging; which Sir Gareth graspt,</a>
<a id='line_2171'>  And so, before the two could hinder him,</a>
<a id='line_2172'>  Sent all his heart and breath through all the horn.</a>
<a id='line_2173'>  Echoed the walls; a light twinkled; anon</a>
<a id='line_2174'>  Came lights and lights, and once again he blew;</a>
<a id='line_2175'>  Whereon were hollow tramplings up and down</a>
<a id='line_2176'>  And muffled voices heard, and shadows past;</a>
<a id='line_2177'>  Till high above him, circled with her maids,</a>
<a id='line_2178'>  The Lady Lyonors at a window stood,</a>
<a id='line_2179'>  Beautiful among lights, and waving to him</a>
<a id='line_2180'>  White hands, and courtesy; but when the Prince</a>
<a id='line_2181'>  Three times had blown--after long hush--at last--</a>
<a id='line_2182'>  The huge pavilion slowly yielded up,</a>
<a id='line_2183'>  Through those black foldings, that which housed therein.</a>
<a id='line_2184'>  High on a nightblack horse, in nightblack arms,</a>
<a id='line_2185'>  With white breast-bone, and barren ribs of Death,</a>
<a id='line_2186'>  And crowned with fleshless laughter--some ten steps--</a>
<a id='line_2187'>  In the half-light--through the dim dawn--advanced</a>
<a id='line_2188'>  The monster, and then paused, and spake no word.</a>
<a id='line_2189'></a>
<a id='line_2190'>     But Gareth spake and all indignantly,</a>
<a id='line_2191'>  'Fool, for thou hast, men say, the strength of ten,</a>
<a id='line_2192'>  Canst thou not trust the limbs thy God hath given,</a>
<a id='line_2193'>  But must, to make the terror of thee more,</a>
<a id='line_2194'>  Trick thyself out in ghastly imageries</a>
<a id='line_2195'>  Of that which Life hath done with, and the clod,</a>
<a id='line_2196'>  Less dull than thou, will hide with mantling flowers</a>
<a id='line_2197'>  As if for pity?'  But he spake no word;</a>
<a id='line_2198'>  Which set the horror higher:  a maiden swooned;</a>
<a id='line_2199'>  The Lady Lyonors wrung her hands and wept,</a>
<a id='line_2200'>  As doomed to be the bride of Night and Death;</a>
<a id='line_2201'>  Sir Gareth's head prickled beneath his helm;</a>
<a id='line_2202'>  And even Sir Lancelot through his warm blood felt</a>
<a id='line_2203'>  Ice strike, and all that marked him were aghast.</a>
<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>     At once Sir Lancelot's charger fiercely neighed,</a>
<a id='line_2206'>  And Death's dark war-horse bounded forward with him.</a>
<a id='line_2207'>  Then those that did not blink the terror, saw</a>
<a id='line_2208'>  That Death was cast to ground, and slowly rose.</a>
<a id='line_2209'>  But with one stroke Sir Gareth split the skull.</a>
<a id='line_2210'>  Half fell to right and half to left and lay.</a>
<a id='line_2211'>  Then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm</a>
<a id='line_2212'>  As throughly as the skull; and out from this</a>
<a id='line_2213'>  Issued the bright face of a blooming boy</a>
<a id='line_2214'>  Fresh as a flower new-born, and crying, 'Knight,</a>
<a id='line_2215'>  Slay me not:  my three brethren bad me do it,</a>
<a id='line_2216'>  To make a horror all about the house,</a>
<a id='line_2217'>  And stay the world from Lady Lyonors.</a>
<a id='line_2218'>  They never dreamed the passes would be past.'</a>
<a id='line_2219'>  Answered Sir Gareth graciously to one</a>
<a id='line_2220'>  Not many a moon his younger, 'My fair child,</a>
<a id='line_2221'>  What madness made thee challenge the chief knight</a>
<a id='line_2222'>  Of Arthur's hall?'  'Fair Sir, they bad me do it.</a>
<a id='line_2223'>  They hate the King, and Lancelot, the King's friend,</a>
<a id='line_2224'>  They hoped to slay him somewhere on the stream,</a>
<a id='line_2225'>  They never dreamed the passes could be past.'</a>
<a id='line_2226'></a>
<a id='line_2227'>     Then sprang the happier day from underground;</a>
<a id='line_2228'>  And Lady Lyonors and her house, with dance</a>
<a id='line_2229'>  And revel and song, made merry over Death,</a>
<a id='line_2230'>  As being after all their foolish fears</a>
<a id='line_2231'>  And horrors only proven a blooming boy.</a>
<a id='line_2232'>  So large mirth lived and Gareth won the quest.</a>
<a id='line_2233'></a>
<a id='line_2234'>     And he that told the tale in older times</a>
<a id='line_2235'>  Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors,</a>
<a id='line_2236'>  But he, that told it later, says Lynette.</a>
<a id='line_2237'></a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'></a>
<a id='line_2240'>  The Marriage of Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2241'></a>
<a id='line_2242'>  The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,</a>
<a id='line_2243'>  A tributary prince of Devon, one</a>
<a id='line_2244'>  Of that great Order of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_2245'>  Had married Enid, Yniol's only child,</a>
<a id='line_2246'>  And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2247'>  And as the light of Heaven varies, now</a>
<a id='line_2248'>  At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night</a>
<a id='line_2249'>  With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2250'>  To make her beauty vary day by day,</a>
<a id='line_2251'>  In crimsons and in purples and in gems.</a>
<a id='line_2252'>  And Enid, but to please her husband's eye,</a>
<a id='line_2253'>  Who first had found and loved her in a state</a>
<a id='line_2254'>  Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him</a>
<a id='line_2255'>  In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,</a>
<a id='line_2256'>  Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,</a>
<a id='line_2257'>  Loved her, and often with her own white hands</a>
<a id='line_2258'>  Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,</a>
<a id='line_2259'>  Next after her own self, in all the court.</a>
<a id='line_2260'>  And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart</a>
<a id='line_2261'>  Adored her, as the stateliest and the best</a>
<a id='line_2262'>  And loveliest of all women upon earth.</a>
<a id='line_2263'>  And seeing them so tender and so close,</a>
<a id='line_2264'>  Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_2265'>  But when a rumour rose about the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_2266'>  Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_2267'>  Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard</a>
<a id='line_2268'>  The world's loud whisper breaking into storm,</a>
<a id='line_2269'>  Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell</a>
<a id='line_2270'>  A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,</a>
<a id='line_2271'>  Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_2272'>  Had suffered, or should suffer any taint</a>
<a id='line_2273'>  In nature:  wherefore going to the King,</a>
<a id='line_2274'>  He made this pretext, that his princedom lay</a>
<a id='line_2275'>  Close on the borders of a territory,</a>
<a id='line_2276'>  Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,</a>
<a id='line_2277'>  Assassins, and all flyers from the hand</a>
<a id='line_2278'>  Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:</a>
<a id='line_2279'>  And therefore, till the King himself should please</a>
<a id='line_2280'>  To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,</a>
<a id='line_2281'>  He craved a fair permission to depart,</a>
<a id='line_2282'>  And there defend his marches; and the King</a>
<a id='line_2283'>  Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,</a>
<a id='line_2284'>  Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,</a>
<a id='line_2285'>  And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores</a>
<a id='line_2286'>  Of Severn, and they past to their own land;</a>
<a id='line_2287'>  Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife</a>
<a id='line_2288'>  True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,</a>
<a id='line_2289'>  He compassed her with sweet observances</a>
<a id='line_2290'>  And worship, never leaving her, and grew</a>
<a id='line_2291'>  Forgetful of his promise to the King,</a>
<a id='line_2292'>  Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,</a>
<a id='line_2293'>  Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  Forgetful of his glory and his name,</a>
<a id='line_2295'>  Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.</a>
<a id='line_2296'>  And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.</a>
<a id='line_2297'>  And by and by the people, when they met</a>
<a id='line_2298'>  In twos and threes, or fuller companies,</a>
<a id='line_2299'>  Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him</a>
<a id='line_2300'>  As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,</a>
<a id='line_2301'>  And molten down in mere uxoriousness.</a>
<a id='line_2302'>  And this she gathered from the people's eyes:</a>
<a id='line_2303'>  This too the women who attired her head,</a>
<a id='line_2304'>  To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,</a>
<a id='line_2305'>  Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:</a>
<a id='line_2306'>  And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2307'>  But could not out of bashful delicacy;</a>
<a id='line_2308'>  While he that watched her sadden, was the more</a>
<a id='line_2309'>  Suspicious that her nature had a taint.</a>
<a id='line_2310'></a>
<a id='line_2311'>     At last, it chanced that on a summer morn</a>
<a id='line_2312'>  (They sleeping each by either) the new sun</a>
<a id='line_2313'>  Beat through the blindless casement of the room,</a>
<a id='line_2314'>  And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;</a>
<a id='line_2315'>  Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,</a>
<a id='line_2316'>  And bared the knotted column of his throat,</a>
<a id='line_2317'>  The massive square of his heroic breast,</a>
<a id='line_2318'>  And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,</a>
<a id='line_2319'>  As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,</a>
<a id='line_2320'>  Running too vehemently to break upon it.</a>
<a id='line_2321'>  And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,</a>
<a id='line_2322'>  Admiring him, and thought within herself,</a>
<a id='line_2323'>  Was ever man so grandly made as he?</a>
<a id='line_2324'>  Then, like a shadow, past the people's talk</a>
<a id='line_2325'>  And accusation of uxoriousness</a>
<a id='line_2326'>  Across her mind, and bowing over him,</a>
<a id='line_2327'>  Low to her own heart piteously she said:</a>
<a id='line_2328'></a>
<a id='line_2329'>     'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,</a>
<a id='line_2330'>  Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men</a>
<a id='line_2331'>  Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?</a>
<a id='line_2332'>  I am the cause, because I dare not speak</a>
<a id='line_2333'>  And tell him what I think and what they say.</a>
<a id='line_2334'>  And yet I hate that he should linger here;</a>
<a id='line_2335'>  I cannot love my lord and not his name.</a>
<a id='line_2336'>  Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,</a>
<a id='line_2337'>  And ride with him to battle and stand by,</a>
<a id='line_2338'>  And watch his mightful hand striking great blows</a>
<a id='line_2339'>  At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.</a>
<a id='line_2340'>  Far better were I laid in the dark earth,</a>
<a id='line_2341'>  Not hearing any more his noble voice,</a>
<a id='line_2342'>  Not to be folded more in these dear arms,</a>
<a id='line_2343'>  And darkened from the high light in his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_2344'>  Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.</a>
<a id='line_2345'>  Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,</a>
<a id='line_2346'>  And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,</a>
<a id='line_2347'>  And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_2348'>  And yet not dare to tell him what I think,</a>
<a id='line_2349'>  And how men slur him, saying all his force</a>
<a id='line_2350'>  Is melted into mere effeminacy?</a>
<a id='line_2351'>  O me, I fear that I am no true wife.'</a>
<a id='line_2352'></a>
<a id='line_2353'>     Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,</a>
<a id='line_2354'>  And the strong passion in her made her weep</a>
<a id='line_2355'>  True tears upon his broad and naked breast,</a>
<a id='line_2356'>  And these awoke him, and by great mischance</a>
<a id='line_2357'>  He heard but fragments of her later words,</a>
<a id='line_2358'>  And that she feared she was not a true wife.</a>
<a id='line_2359'>  And then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,</a>
<a id='line_2360'>  For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,</a>
<a id='line_2361'>  She is not faithful to me, and I see her</a>
<a id='line_2362'>  Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'</a>
<a id='line_2363'>  Then though he loved and reverenced her too much</a>
<a id='line_2364'>  To dream she could be guilty of foul act,</a>
<a id='line_2365'>  Right through his manful breast darted the pang</a>
<a id='line_2366'>  That makes a man, in the sweet face of her</a>
<a id='line_2367'>  Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.</a>
<a id='line_2368'>  At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,</a>
<a id='line_2369'>  And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,</a>
<a id='line_2370'>  'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,</a>
<a id='line_2371'>  'I will ride forth into the wilderness;</a>
<a id='line_2372'>  For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,</a>
<a id='line_2373'>  I have not fallen so low as some would wish.</a>
<a id='line_2374'>  And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress</a>
<a id='line_2375'>  And ride with me.'  And Enid asked, amazed,</a>
<a id='line_2376'>  'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'</a>
<a id='line_2377'>  But he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'</a>
<a id='line_2378'>  Then she bethought her of a faded silk,</a>
<a id='line_2379'>  A faded mantle and a faded veil,</a>
<a id='line_2380'>  And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>  Wherein she kept them folded reverently</a>
<a id='line_2382'>  With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,</a>
<a id='line_2383'>  She took them, and arrayed herself therein,</a>
<a id='line_2384'>  Remembering when first he came on her</a>
<a id='line_2385'>  Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>  And all her foolish fears about the dress,</a>
<a id='line_2387'>  And all his journey to her, as himself</a>
<a id='line_2388'>  Had told her, and their coming to the court.</a>
<a id='line_2389'></a>
<a id='line_2390'>     For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before</a>
<a id='line_2391'>  Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.</a>
<a id='line_2392'>  There on a day, he sitting high in hall,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>  Before him came a forester of Dean,</a>
<a id='line_2394'>  Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart</a>
<a id='line_2395'>  Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,</a>
<a id='line_2396'>  First seen that day:  these things he told the King.</a>
<a id='line_2397'>  Then the good King gave order to let blow</a>
<a id='line_2398'>  His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.</a>
<a id='line_2399'>  And when the King petitioned for his leave</a>
<a id='line_2400'>  To see the hunt, allowed it easily.</a>
<a id='line_2401'>  So with the morning all the court were gone.</a>
<a id='line_2402'>  But Guinevere lay late into the morn,</a>
<a id='line_2403'>  Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love</a>
<a id='line_2404'>  For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;</a>
<a id='line_2405'>  But rose at last, a single maiden with her,</a>
<a id='line_2406'>  Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;</a>
<a id='line_2407'>  There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed</a>
<a id='line_2408'>  Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead</a>
<a id='line_2409'>  A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2410'>  Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress</a>
<a id='line_2411'>  Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,</a>
<a id='line_2412'>  Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford</a>
<a id='line_2413'>  Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.</a>
<a id='line_2414'>  A purple scarf, at either end whereof</a>
<a id='line_2415'>  There swung an apple of the purest gold,</a>
<a id='line_2416'>  Swayed round about him, as he galloped up</a>
<a id='line_2417'>  To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly</a>
<a id='line_2418'>  In summer suit and silks of holiday.</a>
<a id='line_2419'>  Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,</a>
<a id='line_2420'>  Sweet and statelily, and with all grace</a>
<a id='line_2421'>  Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:</a>
<a id='line_2422'>  'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'</a>
<a id='line_2423'>  'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late</a>
<a id='line_2424'>  That I but come like you to see the hunt,</a>
<a id='line_2425'>  Not join it.'  'Therefore wait with me,' she said;</a>
<a id='line_2426'>  'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,</a>
<a id='line_2427'>  There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:</a>
<a id='line_2428'>  Here often they break covert at our feet.'</a>
<a id='line_2429'></a>
<a id='line_2430'>     And while they listened for the distant hunt,</a>
<a id='line_2431'>  And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,</a>
<a id='line_2432'>  King Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode</a>
<a id='line_2433'>  Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_2434'>  Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight</a>
<a id='line_2435'>  Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,</a>
<a id='line_2436'>  Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.</a>
<a id='line_2437'>  And Guinevere, not mindful of his face</a>
<a id='line_2438'>  In the King's hall, desired his name, and sent</a>
<a id='line_2439'>  Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_2440'>  Who being vicious, old and irritable,</a>
<a id='line_2441'>  And doubling all his master's vice of pride,</a>
<a id='line_2442'>  Made answer sharply that she should not know.</a>
<a id='line_2443'>  'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.</a>
<a id='line_2444'>  'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;</a>
<a id='line_2445'>  'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'</a>
<a id='line_2446'>  And when she put her horse toward the knight,</a>
<a id='line_2447'>  Struck at her with his whip, and she returned</a>
<a id='line_2448'>  Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2449'>  Exclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'</a>
<a id='line_2450'>  Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,</a>
<a id='line_2451'>  Who answered as before; and when the Prince</a>
<a id='line_2452'>  Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>  Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.</a>
<a id='line_2454'>  The Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,</a>
<a id='line_2455'>  Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand</a>
<a id='line_2456'>  Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:</a>
<a id='line_2457'>  But he, from his exceeding manfulness</a>
<a id='line_2458'>  And pure nobility of temperament,</a>
<a id='line_2459'>  Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained</a>
<a id='line_2460'>  From even a word, and so returning said:</a>
<a id='line_2461'></a>
<a id='line_2462'>     'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,</a>
<a id='line_2463'>  Done in your maiden's person to yourself:</a>
<a id='line_2464'>  And I will track this vermin to their earths:</a>
<a id='line_2465'>  For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt</a>
<a id='line_2466'>  To find, at some place I shall come at, arms</a>
<a id='line_2467'>  On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,</a>
<a id='line_2468'>  Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,</a>
<a id='line_2469'>  And on the third day will again be here,</a>
<a id='line_2470'>  So that I be not fallen in fight.  Farewell.'</a>
<a id='line_2471'></a>
<a id='line_2472'>     'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.</a>
<a id='line_2473'>  'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;</a>
<a id='line_2474'>  And may you light on all things that you love,</a>
<a id='line_2475'>  And live to wed with her whom first you love:</a>
<a id='line_2476'>  But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,</a>
<a id='line_2477'>  And I, were she the daughter of a king,</a>
<a id='line_2478'>  Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,</a>
<a id='line_2479'>  Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'</a>
<a id='line_2480'></a>
<a id='line_2481'>     And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard</a>
<a id='line_2482'>  The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,</a>
<a id='line_2483'>  A little vext at losing of the hunt,</a>
<a id='line_2484'>  A little at the vile occasion, rode,</a>
<a id='line_2485'>  By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade</a>
<a id='line_2486'>  And valley, with fixt eye following the three.</a>
<a id='line_2487'>  At last they issued from the world of wood,</a>
<a id='line_2488'>  And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,</a>
<a id='line_2489'>  And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.</a>
<a id='line_2490'>  And thither there came Geraint, and underneath</a>
<a id='line_2491'>  Beheld the long street of a little town</a>
<a id='line_2492'>  In a long valley, on one side whereof,</a>
<a id='line_2493'>  White from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;</a>
<a id='line_2494'>  And on one side a castle in decay,</a>
<a id='line_2495'>  Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:</a>
<a id='line_2496'>  And out of town and valley came a noise</a>
<a id='line_2497'>  As of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed</a>
<a id='line_2498'>  Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks</a>
<a id='line_2499'>  At distance, ere they settle for the night.</a>
<a id='line_2500'></a>
<a id='line_2501'>     And onward to the fortress rode the three,</a>
<a id='line_2502'>  And entered, and were lost behind the walls.</a>
<a id='line_2503'>  'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'</a>
<a id='line_2504'>  And down the long street riding wearily,</a>
<a id='line_2505'>  Found every hostel full, and everywhere</a>
<a id='line_2506'>  Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss</a>
<a id='line_2507'>  And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured</a>
<a id='line_2508'>  His master's armour; and of such a one</a>
<a id='line_2509'>  He asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'</a>
<a id='line_2510'>  Who told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'</a>
<a id='line_2511'>  Then riding close behind an ancient churl,</a>
<a id='line_2512'>  Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,</a>
<a id='line_2513'>  Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,</a>
<a id='line_2514'>  Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?</a>
<a id='line_2515'>  Who answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'</a>
<a id='line_2516'>  Then riding further past an armourer's,</a>
<a id='line_2517'>  Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,</a>
<a id='line_2518'>  Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,</a>
<a id='line_2519'>  He put the self-same query, but the man</a>
<a id='line_2520'>  Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:</a>
<a id='line_2521'>  'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk</a>
<a id='line_2522'>  Has little time for idle questioners.'</a>
<a id='line_2523'>  Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:</a>
<a id='line_2524'>  'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!</a>
<a id='line_2525'>  Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!</a>
<a id='line_2526'>  Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg</a>
<a id='line_2527'>  The murmur of the world!  What is it to me?</a>
<a id='line_2528'>  O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,</a>
<a id='line_2529'>  Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!</a>
<a id='line_2530'>  Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,</a>
<a id='line_2531'>  Where can I get me harbourage for the night?</a>
<a id='line_2532'>  And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy?  Speak!'</a>
<a id='line_2533'>  Whereat the armourer turning all amazed</a>
<a id='line_2534'>  And seeing one so gay in purple silks,</a>
<a id='line_2535'>  Came forward with the helmet yet in hand</a>
<a id='line_2536'>  And answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;</a>
<a id='line_2537'>  We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,</a>
<a id='line_2538'>  And there is scantly time for half the work.</a>
<a id='line_2539'>  Arms? truth! I know not:  all are wanted here.</a>
<a id='line_2540'>  Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,</a>
<a id='line_2541'>  It may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge</a>
<a id='line_2542'>  Yonder.'  He spoke and fell to work again.</a>
<a id='line_2543'></a>
<a id='line_2544'>     Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,</a>
<a id='line_2545'>  Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.</a>
<a id='line_2546'>  There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,</a>
<a id='line_2547'>  (His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,</a>
<a id='line_2548'>  Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:</a>
<a id='line_2549'>  'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,</a>
<a id='line_2550'>  'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'</a>
<a id='line_2551'>  Then Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake</a>
<a id='line_2552'>  The slender entertainment of a house</a>
<a id='line_2553'>  Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'</a>
<a id='line_2554'>  'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;</a>
<a id='line_2555'>  'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks</a>
<a id='line_2556'>  For supper, I will enter, I will eat</a>
<a id='line_2557'>  With all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'</a>
<a id='line_2558'>  Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,</a>
<a id='line_2559'>  And answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine</a>
<a id='line_2560'>  To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:</a>
<a id='line_2561'>  But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>  We will not touch upon him even in jest.'</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>     Then rode Geraint into the castle court,</a>
<a id='line_2565'>  His charger trampling many a prickly star</a>
<a id='line_2566'>  Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.</a>
<a id='line_2567'>  He looked and saw that all was ruinous.</a>
<a id='line_2568'>  Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;</a>
<a id='line_2569'>  And here had fallen a great part of a tower,</a>
<a id='line_2570'>  Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,</a>
<a id='line_2571'>  And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:</a>
<a id='line_2572'>  And high above a piece of turret stair,</a>
<a id='line_2573'>  Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound</a>
<a id='line_2574'>  Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems</a>
<a id='line_2575'>  Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,</a>
<a id='line_2576'>  And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked</a>
<a id='line_2577'>  A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.</a>
<a id='line_2578'></a>
<a id='line_2579'>     And while he waited in the castle court,</a>
<a id='line_2580'>  The voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang</a>
<a id='line_2581'>  Clear through the open casement of the hall,</a>
<a id='line_2582'>  Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,</a>
<a id='line_2583'>  Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,</a>
<a id='line_2584'>  Moves him to think what kind of bird it is</a>
<a id='line_2585'>  That sings so delicately clear, and make</a>
<a id='line_2586'>  Conjecture of the plumage and the form;</a>
<a id='line_2587'>  So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;</a>
<a id='line_2588'>  And made him like a man abroad at morn</a>
<a id='line_2589'>  When first the liquid note beloved of men</a>
<a id='line_2590'>  Comes flying over many a windy wave</a>
<a id='line_2591'>  To Britain, and in April suddenly</a>
<a id='line_2592'>  Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,</a>
<a id='line_2593'>  And he suspends his converse with a friend,</a>
<a id='line_2594'>  Or it may be the labour of his hands,</a>
<a id='line_2595'>  To think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'</a>
<a id='line_2596'>  So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>  'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'</a>
<a id='line_2598'></a>
<a id='line_2599'>     It chanced the song that Enid sang was one</a>
<a id='line_2600'>  Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:</a>
<a id='line_2601'></a>
<a id='line_2602'>     'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;</a>
<a id='line_2603'>  Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;</a>
<a id='line_2604'>  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</a>
<a id='line_2605'></a>
<a id='line_2606'>     'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;</a>
<a id='line_2607'>  With that wild wheel we go not up or down;</a>
<a id='line_2608'>  Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>     'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;</a>
<a id='line_2611'>  Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;</a>
<a id='line_2612'>  For man is man and master of his fate.</a>
<a id='line_2613'></a>
<a id='line_2614'>     'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;</a>
<a id='line_2615'>  Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;</a>
<a id='line_2616'>  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'</a>
<a id='line_2617'></a>
<a id='line_2618'>     'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'</a>
<a id='line_2619'>  Said Yniol; 'enter quickly.'  Entering then,</a>
<a id='line_2620'>  Right o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,</a>
<a id='line_2621'>  The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,</a>
<a id='line_2622'>  He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;</a>
<a id='line_2623'>  And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>  That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,</a>
<a id='line_2625'>  Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,</a>
<a id='line_2626'>  Her daughter.  In a moment thought Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2627'>  'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'</a>
<a id='line_2628'>  But none spake word except the hoary Earl:</a>
<a id='line_2629'>  'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;</a>
<a id='line_2630'>  Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then</a>
<a id='line_2631'>  Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;</a>
<a id='line_2632'>  And we will make us merry as we may.</a>
<a id='line_2633'>  Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'</a>
<a id='line_2634'></a>
<a id='line_2635'>     He spake:  the Prince, as Enid past him, fain</a>
<a id='line_2636'>  To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught</a>
<a id='line_2637'>  His purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!</a>
<a id='line_2638'>  Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,</a>
<a id='line_2639'>  Endures not that her guest should serve himself.'</a>
<a id='line_2640'>  And reverencing the custom of the house</a>
<a id='line_2641'>  Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.</a>
<a id='line_2642'></a>
<a id='line_2643'>     So Enid took his charger to the stall;</a>
<a id='line_2644'>  And after went her way across the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_2645'>  And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl</a>
<a id='line_2646'>  Yet spoke together, came again with one,</a>
<a id='line_2647'>  A youth, that following with a costrel bore</a>
<a id='line_2648'>  The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.</a>
<a id='line_2649'>  And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,</a>
<a id='line_2650'>  And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.</a>
<a id='line_2651'>  And then, because their hall must also serve</a>
<a id='line_2652'>  For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,</a>
<a id='line_2653'>  And stood behind, and waited on the three.</a>
<a id='line_2654'>  And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,</a>
<a id='line_2655'>  Geraint had longing in him evermore</a>
<a id='line_2656'>  To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,</a>
<a id='line_2657'>  That crost the trencher as she laid it down:</a>
<a id='line_2658'>  But after all had eaten, then Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2659'>  For now the wine made summer in his veins,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>  Let his eye rove in following, or rest</a>
<a id='line_2661'>  On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,</a>
<a id='line_2662'>  Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;</a>
<a id='line_2663'>  Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:</a>
<a id='line_2664'></a>
<a id='line_2665'>     'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;</a>
<a id='line_2666'>  This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.</a>
<a id='line_2667'>  His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:</a>
<a id='line_2668'>  For if he be the knight whom late I saw</a>
<a id='line_2669'>  Ride into that new fortress by your town,</a>
<a id='line_2670'>  White from the mason's hand, then have I sworn</a>
<a id='line_2671'>  From his own lips to have it--I am Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2672'>  Of Devon--for this morning when the Queen</a>
<a id='line_2673'>  Sent her own maiden to demand the name,</a>
<a id='line_2674'>  His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,</a>
<a id='line_2675'>  Struck at her with his whip, and she returned</a>
<a id='line_2676'>  Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore</a>
<a id='line_2677'>  That I would track this caitiff to his hold,</a>
<a id='line_2678'>  And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.</a>
<a id='line_2679'>  And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find</a>
<a id='line_2680'>  Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;</a>
<a id='line_2681'>  They take the rustic murmur of their bourg</a>
<a id='line_2682'>  For the great wave that echoes round the world;</a>
<a id='line_2683'>  They would not hear me speak:  but if ye know</a>
<a id='line_2684'>  Where I can light on arms, or if yourself</a>
<a id='line_2685'>  Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn</a>
<a id='line_2686'>  That I will break his pride and learn his name,</a>
<a id='line_2687'>  Avenging this great insult done the Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_2688'></a>
<a id='line_2689'>     Then cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,</a>
<a id='line_2690'>  Geraint, a name far-sounded among men</a>
<a id='line_2691'>  For noble deeds? and truly I, when first</a>
<a id='line_2692'>  I saw you moving by me on the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>  Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state</a>
<a id='line_2694'>  And presence might have guessed you one of those</a>
<a id='line_2695'>  That eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.</a>
<a id='line_2696'>  Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;</a>
<a id='line_2697'>  For this dear child hath often heard me praise</a>
<a id='line_2698'>  Your feats of arms, and often when I paused</a>
<a id='line_2699'>  Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;</a>
<a id='line_2700'>  So grateful is the noise of noble deeds</a>
<a id='line_2701'>  To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:</a>
<a id='line_2702'>  O never yet had woman such a pair</a>
<a id='line_2703'>  Of suitors as this maiden:  first Limours,</a>
<a id='line_2704'>  A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,</a>
<a id='line_2705'>  Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead</a>
<a id='line_2706'>  I know not, but he past to the wild land.</a>
<a id='line_2707'>  The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,</a>
<a id='line_2708'>  My curse, my nephew--I will not let his name</a>
<a id='line_2709'>  Slip from my lips if I can help it--he,</a>
<a id='line_2710'>  When that I knew him fierce and turbulent</a>
<a id='line_2711'>  Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;</a>
<a id='line_2712'>  And since the proud man often is the mean,</a>
<a id='line_2713'>  He sowed a slander in the common ear,</a>
<a id='line_2714'>  Affirming that his father left him gold,</a>
<a id='line_2715'>  And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;</a>
<a id='line_2716'>  Bribed with large promises the men who served</a>
<a id='line_2717'>  About my person, the more easily</a>
<a id='line_2718'>  Because my means were somewhat broken into</a>
<a id='line_2719'>  Through open doors and hospitality;</a>
<a id='line_2720'>  Raised my own town against me in the night</a>
<a id='line_2721'>  Before my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;</a>
<a id='line_2722'>  From mine own earldom foully ousted me;</a>
<a id='line_2723'>  Built that new fort to overawe my friends,</a>
<a id='line_2724'>  For truly there are those who love me yet;</a>
<a id='line_2725'>  And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,</a>
<a id='line_2726'>  Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,</a>
<a id='line_2727'>  But that his pride too much despises me:</a>
<a id='line_2728'>  And I myself sometimes despise myself;</a>
<a id='line_2729'>  For I have let men be, and have their way;</a>
<a id='line_2730'>  Am much too gentle, have not used my power:</a>
<a id='line_2731'>  Nor know I whether I be very base</a>
<a id='line_2732'>  Or very manful, whether very wise</a>
<a id='line_2733'>  Or very foolish; only this I know,</a>
<a id='line_2734'>  That whatsoever evil happen to me,</a>
<a id='line_2735'>  I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,</a>
<a id='line_2736'>  But can endure it all most patiently.'</a>
<a id='line_2737'></a>
<a id='line_2738'>     'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,</a>
<a id='line_2739'>  That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight</a>
<a id='line_2740'>  In next day's tourney I may break his pride.'</a>
<a id='line_2741'></a>
<a id='line_2742'>     And Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old</a>
<a id='line_2743'>  And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2744'>  Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.</a>
<a id='line_2745'>  But in this tournament can no man tilt,</a>
<a id='line_2746'>  Except the lady he loves best be there.</a>
<a id='line_2747'>  Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,</a>
<a id='line_2748'>  And over these is placed a silver wand,</a>
<a id='line_2749'>  And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>  The prize of beauty for the fairest there.</a>
<a id='line_2751'>  And this, what knight soever be in field</a>
<a id='line_2752'>  Lays claim to for the lady at his side,</a>
<a id='line_2753'>  And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,</a>
<a id='line_2754'>  Who being apt at arms and big of bone</a>
<a id='line_2755'>  Has ever won it for the lady with him,</a>
<a id='line_2756'>  And toppling over all antagonism</a>
<a id='line_2757'>  Has earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'</a>
<a id='line_2758'>  But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'</a>
<a id='line_2759'></a>
<a id='line_2760'>     To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,</a>
<a id='line_2761'>  Leaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!</a>
<a id='line_2762'>  Let me lay lance in rest, O noble host,</a>
<a id='line_2763'>  For this dear child, because I never saw,</a>
<a id='line_2764'>  Though having seen all beauties of our time,</a>
<a id='line_2765'>  Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.</a>
<a id='line_2766'>  And if I fall her name will yet remain</a>
<a id='line_2767'>  Untarnished as before; but if I live,</a>
<a id='line_2768'>  So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,</a>
<a id='line_2769'>  As I will make her truly my true wife.'</a>
<a id='line_2770'></a>
<a id='line_2771'>     Then, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart</a>
<a id='line_2772'>  Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,</a>
<a id='line_2773'>  And looking round he saw not Enid there,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>  (Who hearing her own name had stolen away)</a>
<a id='line_2775'>  But that old dame, to whom full tenderly</a>
<a id='line_2776'>  And folding all her hand in his he said,</a>
<a id='line_2777'>  'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,</a>
<a id='line_2778'>  And best by her that bore her understood.</a>
<a id='line_2779'>  Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest</a>
<a id='line_2780'>  Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'</a>
<a id='line_2781'></a>
<a id='line_2782'>     So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she</a>
<a id='line_2783'>  With frequent smile and nod departing found,</a>
<a id='line_2784'>  Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;</a>
<a id='line_2785'>  Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then</a>
<a id='line_2786'>  On either shining shoulder laid a hand,</a>
<a id='line_2787'>  And kept her off and gazed upon her face,</a>
<a id='line_2788'>  And told them all their converse in the hall,</a>
<a id='line_2789'>  Proving her heart:  but never light and shade</a>
<a id='line_2790'>  Coursed one another more on open ground</a>
<a id='line_2791'>  Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale</a>
<a id='line_2792'>  Across the face of Enid hearing her;</a>
<a id='line_2793'>  While slowly falling as a scale that falls,</a>
<a id='line_2794'>  When weight is added only grain by grain,</a>
<a id='line_2795'>  Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;</a>
<a id='line_2796'>  Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,</a>
<a id='line_2797'>  Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;</a>
<a id='line_2798'>  So moving without answer to her rest</a>
<a id='line_2799'>  She found no rest, and ever failed to draw</a>
<a id='line_2800'>  The quiet night into her blood, but lay</a>
<a id='line_2801'>  Contemplating her own unworthiness;</a>
<a id='line_2802'>  And when the pale and bloodless east began</a>
<a id='line_2803'>  To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised</a>
<a id='line_2804'>  Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved</a>
<a id='line_2805'>  Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,</a>
<a id='line_2806'>  And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_2807'></a>
<a id='line_2808'>     And thither came the twain, and when Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2809'>  Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,</a>
<a id='line_2810'>  He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,</a>
<a id='line_2811'>  Himself beyond the rest pushing could move</a>
<a id='line_2812'>  The chair of Idris.  Yniol's rusted arms</a>
<a id='line_2813'>  Were on his princely person, but through these</a>
<a id='line_2814'>  Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights</a>
<a id='line_2815'>  And ladies came, and by and by the town</a>
<a id='line_2816'>  Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.</a>
<a id='line_2817'>  And there they fixt the forks into the ground,</a>
<a id='line_2818'>  And over these they placed the silver wand,</a>
<a id='line_2819'>  And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.</a>
<a id='line_2820'>  Then Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,</a>
<a id='line_2821'>  Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,</a>
<a id='line_2822'>  'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,</a>
<a id='line_2823'>  What I these two years past have won for thee,</a>
<a id='line_2824'>  The prize of beauty.'  Loudly spake the Prince,</a>
<a id='line_2825'>  'Forbear:  there is a worthier,' and the knight</a>
<a id='line_2826'>  With some surprise and thrice as much disdain</a>
<a id='line_2827'>  Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face</a>
<a id='line_2828'>  Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,</a>
<a id='line_2829'>  So burnt he was with passion, crying out,</a>
<a id='line_2830'>  'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice</a>
<a id='line_2831'>  They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.</a>
<a id='line_2832'>  Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each</a>
<a id='line_2833'>  So often and with such blows, that all the crowd</a>
<a id='line_2834'>  Wondered, and now and then from distant walls</a>
<a id='line_2835'>  There came a clapping as of phantom hands.</a>
<a id='line_2836'>  So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still</a>
<a id='line_2837'>  The dew of their great labour, and the blood</a>
<a id='line_2838'>  Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.</a>
<a id='line_2839'>  But either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,</a>
<a id='line_2840'>  'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'</a>
<a id='line_2841'>  Increased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,</a>
<a id='line_2842'>  And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,</a>
<a id='line_2843'>  And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,</a>
<a id='line_2844'>  And said, 'Thy name?'  To whom the fallen man</a>
<a id='line_2845'>  Made answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!</a>
<a id='line_2846'>  Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.</a>
<a id='line_2847'>  My pride is broken:  men have seen my fall.'</a>
<a id='line_2848'>  'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2849'>  'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.</a>
<a id='line_2850'>  First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,</a>
<a id='line_2851'>  Shalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,</a>
<a id='line_2852'>  Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>  And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,</a>
<a id='line_2854'>  Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.</a>
<a id='line_2855'>  These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'</a>
<a id='line_2856'>  And Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,</a>
<a id='line_2857'>  For I have never yet been overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>  And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride</a>
<a id='line_2859'>  Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'</a>
<a id='line_2860'>  And rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>  And there the Queen forgave him easily.</a>
<a id='line_2862'>  And being young, he changed and came to loathe</a>
<a id='line_2863'>  His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself</a>
<a id='line_2864'>  Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last</a>
<a id='line_2865'>  In the great battle fighting for the King.</a>
<a id='line_2866'></a>
<a id='line_2867'>     But when the third day from the hunting-morn</a>
<a id='line_2868'>  Made a low splendour in the world, and wings</a>
<a id='line_2869'>  Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay</a>
<a id='line_2870'>  With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,</a>
<a id='line_2871'>  Among the dancing shadows of the birds,</a>
<a id='line_2872'>  Woke and bethought her of her promise given</a>
<a id='line_2873'>  No later than last eve to Prince Geraint--</a>
<a id='line_2874'>  So bent he seemed on going the third day,</a>
<a id='line_2875'>  He would not leave her, till her promise given--</a>
<a id='line_2876'>  To ride with him this morning to the court,</a>
<a id='line_2877'>  And there be made known to the stately Queen,</a>
<a id='line_2878'>  And there be wedded with all ceremony.</a>
<a id='line_2879'>  At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,</a>
<a id='line_2880'>  And thought it never yet had looked so mean.</a>
<a id='line_2881'>  For as a leaf in mid-November is</a>
<a id='line_2882'>  To what it is in mid-October, seemed</a>
<a id='line_2883'>  The dress that now she looked on to the dress</a>
<a id='line_2884'>  She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_2885'>  And still she looked, and still the terror grew</a>
<a id='line_2886'>  Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,</a>
<a id='line_2887'>  All staring at her in her faded silk:</a>
<a id='line_2888'>  And softly to her own sweet heart she said:</a>
<a id='line_2889'></a>
<a id='line_2890'>     'This noble prince who won our earldom back,</a>
<a id='line_2891'>  So splendid in his acts and his attire,</a>
<a id='line_2892'>  Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!</a>
<a id='line_2893'>  Would he could tarry with us here awhile,</a>
<a id='line_2894'>  But being so beholden to the Prince,</a>
<a id='line_2895'>  It were but little grace in any of us,</a>
<a id='line_2896'>  Bent as he seemed on going this third day,</a>
<a id='line_2897'>  To seek a second favour at his hands.</a>
<a id='line_2898'>  Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,</a>
<a id='line_2899'>  Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,</a>
<a id='line_2900'>  Far liefer than so much discredit him.'</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'>     And Enid fell in longing for a dress</a>
<a id='line_2903'>  All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift</a>
<a id='line_2904'>  Of her good mother, given her on the night</a>
<a id='line_2905'>  Before her birthday, three sad years ago,</a>
<a id='line_2906'>  That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,</a>
<a id='line_2907'>  And scattered all they had to all the winds:</a>
<a id='line_2908'>  For while the mother showed it, and the two</a>
<a id='line_2909'>  Were turning and admiring it, the work</a>
<a id='line_2910'>  To both appeared so costly, rose a cry</a>
<a id='line_2911'>  That Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled</a>
<a id='line_2912'>  With little save the jewels they had on,</a>
<a id='line_2913'>  Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:</a>
<a id='line_2914'>  And Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,</a>
<a id='line_2915'>  And placed them in this ruin; and she wished</a>
<a id='line_2916'>  The Prince had found her in her ancient home;</a>
<a id='line_2917'>  Then let her fancy flit across the past,</a>
<a id='line_2918'>  And roam the goodly places that she knew;</a>
<a id='line_2919'>  And last bethought her how she used to watch,</a>
<a id='line_2920'>  Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;</a>
<a id='line_2921'>  And one was patched and blurred and lustreless</a>
<a id='line_2922'>  Among his burnished brethren of the pool;</a>
<a id='line_2923'>  And half asleep she made comparison</a>
<a id='line_2924'>  Of that and these to her own faded self</a>
<a id='line_2925'>  And the gay court, and fell asleep again;</a>
<a id='line_2926'>  And dreamt herself was such a faded form</a>
<a id='line_2927'>  Among her burnished sisters of the pool;</a>
<a id='line_2928'>  But this was in the garden of a king;</a>
<a id='line_2929'>  And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew</a>
<a id='line_2930'>  That all was bright; that all about were birds</a>
<a id='line_2931'>  Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;</a>
<a id='line_2932'>  That all the turf was rich in plots that looked</a>
<a id='line_2933'>  Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;</a>
<a id='line_2934'>  And lords and ladies of the high court went</a>
<a id='line_2935'>  In silver tissue talking things of state;</a>
<a id='line_2936'>  And children of the King in cloth of gold</a>
<a id='line_2937'>  Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;</a>
<a id='line_2938'>  And while she thought 'They will not see me,' came</a>
<a id='line_2939'>  A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_2940'>  And all the children in their cloth of gold</a>
<a id='line_2941'>  Ran to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all</a>
<a id='line_2942'>  Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now</a>
<a id='line_2943'>  To pick the faded creature from the pool,</a>
<a id='line_2944'>  And cast it on the mixen that it die.'</a>
<a id='line_2945'>  And therewithal one came and seized on her,</a>
<a id='line_2946'>  And Enid started waking, with her heart</a>
<a id='line_2947'>  All overshadowed by the foolish dream,</a>
<a id='line_2948'>  And lo! it was her mother grasping her</a>
<a id='line_2949'>  To get her well awake; and in her hand</a>
<a id='line_2950'>  A suit of bright apparel, which she laid</a>
<a id='line_2951'>  Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:</a>
<a id='line_2952'></a>
<a id='line_2953'>     'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>  How fast they hold like colours of a shell</a>
<a id='line_2955'>  That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.</a>
<a id='line_2956'>  Why not?  It never yet was worn, I trow:</a>
<a id='line_2957'>  Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'</a>
<a id='line_2958'></a>
<a id='line_2959'>     And Enid looked, but all confused at first,</a>
<a id='line_2960'>  Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:</a>
<a id='line_2961'>  Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,</a>
<a id='line_2962'>  And answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,</a>
<a id='line_2963'>  So sadly lost on that unhappy night;</a>
<a id='line_2964'>  Your own good gift!'  'Yea, surely,' said the dame,</a>
<a id='line_2965'>  'And gladly given again this happy morn.</a>
<a id='line_2966'>  For when the jousts were ended yesterday,</a>
<a id='line_2967'>  Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere</a>
<a id='line_2968'>  He found the sack and plunder of our house</a>
<a id='line_2969'>  All scattered through the houses of the town;</a>
<a id='line_2970'>  And gave command that all which once was ours</a>
<a id='line_2971'>  Should now be ours again:  and yester-eve,</a>
<a id='line_2972'>  While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>  Came one with this and laid it in my hand,</a>
<a id='line_2974'>  For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,</a>
<a id='line_2975'>  Because we have our earldom back again.</a>
<a id='line_2976'>  And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,</a>
<a id='line_2977'>  But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.</a>
<a id='line_2978'>  Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?</a>
<a id='line_2979'>  For I myself unwillingly have worn</a>
<a id='line_2980'>  My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,</a>
<a id='line_2981'>  And howsoever patient, Yniol his.</a>
<a id='line_2982'>  Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,</a>
<a id='line_2983'>  With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,</a>
<a id='line_2984'>  And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,</a>
<a id='line_2985'>  And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all</a>
<a id='line_2986'>  That appertains to noble maintenance.</a>
<a id='line_2987'>  Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;</a>
<a id='line_2988'>  But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>  And all through that young traitor, cruel need</a>
<a id='line_2990'>  Constrained us, but a better time has come;</a>
<a id='line_2991'>  So clothe yourself in this, that better fits</a>
<a id='line_2992'>  Our mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:</a>
<a id='line_2993'>  For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,</a>
<a id='line_2994'>  And though I heard him call you fairest fair,</a>
<a id='line_2995'>  Let never maiden think, however fair,</a>
<a id='line_2996'>  She is not fairer in new clothes than old.</a>
<a id='line_2997'>  And should some great court-lady say, the Prince</a>
<a id='line_2998'>  Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,</a>
<a id='line_2999'>  And like a madman brought her to the court,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>  Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince</a>
<a id='line_3001'>  To whom we are beholden; but I know,</a>
<a id='line_3002'>  That when my dear child is set forth at her best,</a>
<a id='line_3003'>  That neither court nor country, though they sought</a>
<a id='line_3004'>  Through all the provinces like those of old</a>
<a id='line_3005'>  That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'</a>
<a id='line_3006'></a>
<a id='line_3007'>     Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;</a>
<a id='line_3008'>  And Enid listened brightening as she lay;</a>
<a id='line_3009'>  Then, as the white and glittering star of morn</a>
<a id='line_3010'>  Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by</a>
<a id='line_3011'>  Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,</a>
<a id='line_3012'>  And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,</a>
<a id='line_3013'>  Helped by the mother's careful hand and eye,</a>
<a id='line_3014'>  Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;</a>
<a id='line_3015'>  Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,</a>
<a id='line_3016'>  She never yet had seen her half so fair;</a>
<a id='line_3017'>  And called her like that maiden in the tale,</a>
<a id='line_3018'>  Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers</a>
<a id='line_3019'>  And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,</a>
<a id='line_3020'>  Flur, for whose love the Roman Caesar first</a>
<a id='line_3021'>  Invaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,</a>
<a id='line_3022'>  As this great Prince invaded us, and we,</a>
<a id='line_3023'>  Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy</a>
<a id='line_3024'>  And I can scarcely ride with you to court,</a>
<a id='line_3025'>  For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;</a>
<a id='line_3026'>  But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream</a>
<a id='line_3027'>  I see my princess as I see her now,</a>
<a id='line_3028'>  Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'</a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>     But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3031'>  Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called</a>
<a id='line_3032'>  For Enid, and when Yniol made report</a>
<a id='line_3033'>  Of that good mother making Enid gay</a>
<a id='line_3034'>  In such apparel as might well beseem</a>
<a id='line_3035'>  His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,</a>
<a id='line_3036'>  He answered:  'Earl, entreat her by my love,</a>
<a id='line_3037'>  Albeit I give no reason but my wish,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>  That she ride with me in her faded silk.'</a>
<a id='line_3039'>  Yniol with that hard message went; it fell</a>
<a id='line_3040'>  Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:</a>
<a id='line_3041'>  For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,</a>
<a id='line_3042'>  Dared not to glance at her good mother's face,</a>
<a id='line_3043'>  But silently, in all obedience,</a>
<a id='line_3044'>  Her mother silent too, nor helping her,</a>
<a id='line_3045'>  Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,</a>
<a id='line_3046'>  And robed them in her ancient suit again,</a>
<a id='line_3047'>  And so descended.  Never man rejoiced</a>
<a id='line_3048'>  More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;</a>
<a id='line_3049'>  And glancing all at once as keenly at her</a>
<a id='line_3050'>  As careful robins eye the delver's toil,</a>
<a id='line_3051'>  Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,</a>
<a id='line_3052'>  But rested with her sweet face satisfied;</a>
<a id='line_3053'>  Then seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,</a>
<a id='line_3054'>  Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,</a>
<a id='line_3055'></a>
<a id='line_3056'>     'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved</a>
<a id='line_3057'>  At thy new son, for my petition to her.</a>
<a id='line_3058'>  When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,</a>
<a id='line_3059'>  In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,</a>
<a id='line_3060'>  Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,</a>
<a id='line_3061'>  Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3062'>  Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,</a>
<a id='line_3063'>  Beholding one so bright in dark estate,</a>
<a id='line_3064'>  I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,</a>
<a id='line_3065'>  No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst</a>
<a id='line_3066'>  Sunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_3067'>  That service done so graciously would bind</a>
<a id='line_3068'>  The two together; fain I would the two</a>
<a id='line_3069'>  Should love each other:  how can Enid find</a>
<a id='line_3070'>  A nobler friend?  Another thought was mine;</a>
<a id='line_3071'>  I came among you here so suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_3072'>  That though her gentle presence at the lists</a>
<a id='line_3073'>  Might well have served for proof that I was loved,</a>
<a id='line_3074'>  I doubted whether daughter's tenderness,</a>
<a id='line_3075'>  Or easy nature, might not let itself</a>
<a id='line_3076'>  Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;</a>
<a id='line_3077'>  Or whether some false sense in her own self</a>
<a id='line_3078'>  Of my contrasting brightness, overbore</a>
<a id='line_3079'>  Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;</a>
<a id='line_3080'>  And such a sense might make her long for court</a>
<a id='line_3081'>  And all its perilous glories:  and I thought,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>  That could I someway prove such force in her</a>
<a id='line_3083'>  Linked with such love for me, that at a word</a>
<a id='line_3084'>  (No reason given her) she could cast aside</a>
<a id='line_3085'>  A splendour dear to women, new to her,</a>
<a id='line_3086'>  And therefore dearer; or if not so new,</a>
<a id='line_3087'>  Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power</a>
<a id='line_3088'>  Of intermitted usage; then I felt</a>
<a id='line_3089'>  That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,</a>
<a id='line_3090'>  Fixt on her faith.  Now, therefore, I do rest,</a>
<a id='line_3091'>  A prophet certain of my prophecy,</a>
<a id='line_3092'>  That never shadow of mistrust can cross</a>
<a id='line_3093'>  Between us.  Grant me pardon for my thoughts:</a>
<a id='line_3094'>  And for my strange petition I will make</a>
<a id='line_3095'>  Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,</a>
<a id='line_3096'>  When your fair child shall wear your costly gift</a>
<a id='line_3097'>  Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,</a>
<a id='line_3098'>  Who knows? another gift of the high God,</a>
<a id='line_3099'>  Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'</a>
<a id='line_3100'></a>
<a id='line_3101'>     He spoke:  the mother smiled, but half in tears,</a>
<a id='line_3102'>  Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,</a>
<a id='line_3103'>  And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.</a>
<a id='line_3104'></a>
<a id='line_3105'>     Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed</a>
<a id='line_3106'>  The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,</a>
<a id='line_3107'>  Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,</a>
<a id='line_3108'>  And white sails flying on the yellow sea;</a>
<a id='line_3109'>  But not to goodly hill or yellow sea</a>
<a id='line_3110'>  Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,</a>
<a id='line_3111'>  By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;</a>
<a id='line_3112'>  And then descending met them at the gates,</a>
<a id='line_3113'>  Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,</a>
<a id='line_3114'>  And did her honour as the Prince's bride,</a>
<a id='line_3115'>  And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;</a>
<a id='line_3116'>  And all that week was old Caerleon gay,</a>
<a id='line_3117'>  For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,</a>
<a id='line_3118'>  They twain were wedded with all ceremony.</a>
<a id='line_3119'></a>
<a id='line_3120'>     And this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.</a>
<a id='line_3121'>  But Enid ever kept the faded silk,</a>
<a id='line_3122'>  Remembering how first he came on her,</a>
<a id='line_3123'>  Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>  And all her foolish fears about the dress,</a>
<a id='line_3125'>  And all his journey toward her, as himself</a>
<a id='line_3126'>  Had told her, and their coming to the court.</a>
<a id='line_3127'></a>
<a id='line_3128'>     And now this morning when he said to her,</a>
<a id='line_3129'>  'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found</a>
<a id='line_3130'>  And took it, and arrayed herself therein.</a>
<a id='line_3131'></a>
<a id='line_3132'></a>
<a id='line_3133'></a>
<a id='line_3134'>  Geraint and Enid</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>
<a id='line_3136'>  O purblind race of miserable men,</a>
<a id='line_3137'>  How many among us at this very hour</a>
<a id='line_3138'>  Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves,</a>
<a id='line_3139'>  By taking true for false, or false for true;</a>
<a id='line_3140'>  Here, through the feeble twilight of this world</a>
<a id='line_3141'>  Groping, how many, until we pass and reach</a>
<a id='line_3142'>  That other, where we see as we are seen!</a>
<a id='line_3143'></a>
<a id='line_3144'>     So fared it with Geraint, who issuing forth</a>
<a id='line_3145'>  That morning, when they both had got to horse,</a>
<a id='line_3146'>  Perhaps because he loved her passionately,</a>
<a id='line_3147'>  And felt that tempest brooding round his heart,</a>
<a id='line_3148'>  Which, if he spoke at all, would break perforce</a>
<a id='line_3149'>  Upon a head so dear in thunder, said:</a>
<a id='line_3150'>  'Not at my side.  I charge thee ride before,</a>
<a id='line_3151'>  Ever a good way on before; and this</a>
<a id='line_3152'>  I charge thee, on thy duty as a wife,</a>
<a id='line_3153'>  Whatever happens, not to speak to me,</a>
<a id='line_3154'>  No, not a word!' and Enid was aghast;</a>
<a id='line_3155'>  And forth they rode, but scarce three paces on,</a>
<a id='line_3156'>  When crying out, 'Effeminate as I am,</a>
<a id='line_3157'>  I will not fight my way with gilded arms,</a>
<a id='line_3158'>  All shall be iron;' he loosed a mighty purse,</a>
<a id='line_3159'>  Hung at his belt, and hurled it toward the squire.</a>
<a id='line_3160'>  So the last sight that Enid had of home</a>
<a id='line_3161'>  Was all the marble threshold flashing, strown</a>
<a id='line_3162'>  With gold and scattered coinage, and the squire</a>
<a id='line_3163'>  Chafing his shoulder:  then he cried again,</a>
<a id='line_3164'>  'To the wilds!' and Enid leading down the tracks</a>
<a id='line_3165'>  Through which he bad her lead him on, they past</a>
<a id='line_3166'>  The marches, and by bandit-haunted holds,</a>
<a id='line_3167'>  Gray swamps and pools, waste places of the hern,</a>
<a id='line_3168'>  And wildernesses, perilous paths, they rode:</a>
<a id='line_3169'>  Round was their pace at first, but slackened soon:</a>
<a id='line_3170'>  A stranger meeting them had surely thought</a>
<a id='line_3171'>  They rode so slowly and they looked so pale,</a>
<a id='line_3172'>  That each had suffered some exceeding wrong.</a>
<a id='line_3173'>  For he was ever saying to himself,</a>
<a id='line_3174'>  'O I that wasted time to tend upon her,</a>
<a id='line_3175'>  To compass her with sweet observances,</a>
<a id='line_3176'>  To dress her beautifully and keep her true'--</a>
<a id='line_3177'>  And there he broke the sentence in his heart</a>
<a id='line_3178'>  Abruptly, as a man upon his tongue</a>
<a id='line_3179'>  May break it, when his passion masters him.</a>
<a id='line_3180'>  And she was ever praying the sweet heavens</a>
<a id='line_3181'>  To save her dear lord whole from any wound.</a>
<a id='line_3182'>  And ever in her mind she cast about</a>
<a id='line_3183'>  For that unnoticed failing in herself,</a>
<a id='line_3184'>  Which made him look so cloudy and so cold;</a>
<a id='line_3185'>  Till the great plover's human whistle amazed</a>
<a id='line_3186'>  Her heart, and glancing round the waste she feared</a>
<a id='line_3187'>  In every wavering brake an ambuscade.</a>
<a id='line_3188'>  Then thought again, 'If there be such in me,</a>
<a id='line_3189'>  I might amend it by the grace of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_3190'>  If he would only speak and tell me of it.'</a>
<a id='line_3191'></a>
<a id='line_3192'>     But when the fourth part of the day was gone,</a>
<a id='line_3193'>  Then Enid was aware of three tall knights</a>
<a id='line_3194'>  On horseback, wholly armed, behind a rock</a>
<a id='line_3195'>  In shadow, waiting for them, caitiffs all;</a>
<a id='line_3196'>  And heard one crying to his fellow, 'Look,</a>
<a id='line_3197'>  Here comes a laggard hanging down his head,</a>
<a id='line_3198'>  Who seems no bolder than a beaten hound;</a>
<a id='line_3199'>  Come, we will slay him and will have his horse</a>
<a id='line_3200'>  And armour, and his damsel shall be ours.'</a>
<a id='line_3201'></a>
<a id='line_3202'>     Then Enid pondered in her heart, and said:</a>
<a id='line_3203'>  'I will go back a little to my lord,</a>
<a id='line_3204'>  And I will tell him all their caitiff talk;</a>
<a id='line_3205'>  For, be he wroth even to slaying me,</a>
<a id='line_3206'>  Far liefer by his dear hand had I die,</a>
<a id='line_3207'>  Than that my lord should suffer loss or shame.'</a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'>     Then she went back some paces of return,</a>
<a id='line_3210'>  Met his full frown timidly firm, and said;</a>
<a id='line_3211'>  'My lord, I saw three bandits by the rock</a>
<a id='line_3212'>  Waiting to fall on you, and heard them boast</a>
<a id='line_3213'>  That they would slay you, and possess your horse</a>
<a id='line_3214'>  And armour, and your damsel should be theirs.'</a>
<a id='line_3215'></a>
<a id='line_3216'>     He made a wrathful answer:  'Did I wish</a>
<a id='line_3217'>  Your warning or your silence? one command</a>
<a id='line_3218'>  I laid upon you, not to speak to me,</a>
<a id='line_3219'>  And thus ye keep it!  Well then, look--for now,</a>
<a id='line_3220'>  Whether ye wish me victory or defeat,</a>
<a id='line_3221'>  Long for my life, or hunger for my death,</a>
<a id='line_3222'>  Yourself shall see my vigour is not lost.'</a>
<a id='line_3223'></a>
<a id='line_3224'>     Then Enid waited pale and sorrowful,</a>
<a id='line_3225'>  And down upon him bare the bandit three.</a>
<a id='line_3226'>  And at the midmost charging, Prince Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3227'>  Drave the long spear a cubit through his breast</a>
<a id='line_3228'>  And out beyond; and then against his brace</a>
<a id='line_3229'>  Of comrades, each of whom had broken on him</a>
<a id='line_3230'>  A lance that splintered like an icicle,</a>
<a id='line_3231'>  Swung from his brand a windy buffet out</a>
<a id='line_3232'>  Once, twice, to right, to left, and stunned the twain</a>
<a id='line_3233'>  Or slew them, and dismounting like a man</a>
<a id='line_3234'>  That skins the wild beast after slaying him,</a>
<a id='line_3235'>  Stript from the three dead wolves of woman born</a>
<a id='line_3236'>  The three gay suits of armour which they wore,</a>
<a id='line_3237'>  And let the bodies lie, but bound the suits</a>
<a id='line_3238'>  Of armour on their horses, each on each,</a>
<a id='line_3239'>  And tied the bridle-reins of all the three</a>
<a id='line_3240'>  Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on</a>
<a id='line_3241'>  Before you;' and she drove them through the waste.</a>
<a id='line_3242'></a>
<a id='line_3243'>     He followed nearer; ruth began to work</a>
<a id='line_3244'>  Against his anger in him, while he watched</a>
<a id='line_3245'>  The being he loved best in all the world,</a>
<a id='line_3246'>  With difficulty in mild obedience</a>
<a id='line_3247'>  Driving them on:  he fain had spoken to her,</a>
<a id='line_3248'>  And loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath</a>
<a id='line_3249'>  And smouldered wrong that burnt him all within;</a>
<a id='line_3250'>  But evermore it seemed an easier thing</a>
<a id='line_3251'>  At once without remorse to strike her dead,</a>
<a id='line_3252'>  Than to cry 'Halt,' and to her own bright face</a>
<a id='line_3253'>  Accuse her of the least immodesty:</a>
<a id='line_3254'>  And thus tongue-tied, it made him wroth the more</a>
<a id='line_3255'>  That she could speak whom his own ear had heard</a>
<a id='line_3256'>  Call herself false:  and suffering thus he made</a>
<a id='line_3257'>  Minutes an age:  but in scarce longer time</a>
<a id='line_3258'>  Than at Caerleon the full-tided Usk,</a>
<a id='line_3259'>  Before he turn to fall seaward again,</a>
<a id='line_3260'>  Pauses, did Enid, keeping watch, behold</a>
<a id='line_3261'>  In the first shallow shade of a deep wood,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>  Before a gloom of stubborn-shafted oaks,</a>
<a id='line_3263'>  Three other horsemen waiting, wholly armed,</a>
<a id='line_3264'>  Whereof one seemed far larger than her lord,</a>
<a id='line_3265'>  And shook her pulses, crying, 'Look, a prize!</a>
<a id='line_3266'>  Three horses and three goodly suits of arms,</a>
<a id='line_3267'>  And all in charge of whom? a girl:  set on.'</a>
<a id='line_3268'>  'Nay,' said the second, 'yonder comes a knight.'</a>
<a id='line_3269'>  The third, 'A craven; how he hangs his head.'</a>
<a id='line_3270'>  The giant answered merrily, 'Yea, but one?</a>
<a id='line_3271'>  Wait here, and when he passes fall upon him.'</a>
<a id='line_3272'></a>
<a id='line_3273'>     And Enid pondered in her heart and said,</a>
<a id='line_3274'>  'I will abide the coming of my lord,</a>
<a id='line_3275'>  And I will tell him all their villainy.</a>
<a id='line_3276'>  My lord is weary with the fight before,</a>
<a id='line_3277'>  And they will fall upon him unawares.</a>
<a id='line_3278'>  I needs must disobey him for his good;</a>
<a id='line_3279'>  How should I dare obey him to his harm?</a>
<a id='line_3280'>  Needs must I speak, and though he kill me for it,</a>
<a id='line_3281'>  I save a life dearer to me than mine.'</a>
<a id='line_3282'></a>
<a id='line_3283'>     And she abode his coming, and said to him</a>
<a id='line_3284'>  With timid firmness, 'Have I leave to speak?'</a>
<a id='line_3285'>  He said, 'Ye take it, speaking,' and she spoke.</a>
<a id='line_3286'></a>
<a id='line_3287'>     'There lurk three villains yonder in the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3288'>  And each of them is wholly armed, and one</a>
<a id='line_3289'>  Is larger-limbed than you are, and they say</a>
<a id='line_3290'>  That they will fall upon you while ye pass.'</a>
<a id='line_3291'></a>
<a id='line_3292'>     To which he flung a wrathful answer back:</a>
<a id='line_3293'>  'And if there were an hundred in the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3294'>  And every man were larger-limbed than I,</a>
<a id='line_3295'>  And all at once should sally out upon me,</a>
<a id='line_3296'>  I swear it would not ruffle me so much</a>
<a id='line_3297'>  As you that not obey me.  Stand aside,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>  And if I fall, cleave to the better man.'</a>
<a id='line_3299'></a>
<a id='line_3300'>     And Enid stood aside to wait the event,</a>
<a id='line_3301'>  Not dare to watch the combat, only breathe</a>
<a id='line_3302'>  Short fits of prayer, at every stroke a breath.</a>
<a id='line_3303'>  And he, she dreaded most, bare down upon him.</a>
<a id='line_3304'>  Aimed at the helm, his lance erred; but Geraint's,</a>
<a id='line_3305'>  A little in the late encounter strained,</a>
<a id='line_3306'>  Struck through the bulky bandit's corselet home,</a>
<a id='line_3307'>  And then brake short, and down his enemy rolled,</a>
<a id='line_3308'>  And there lay still; as he that tells the tale</a>
<a id='line_3309'>  Saw once a great piece of a promontory,</a>
<a id='line_3310'>  That had a sapling growing on it, slide</a>
<a id='line_3311'>  From the long shore-cliff's windy walls to the beach,</a>
<a id='line_3312'>  And there lie still, and yet the sapling grew:</a>
<a id='line_3313'>  So lay the man transfixt.  His craven pair</a>
<a id='line_3314'>  Of comrades making slowlier at the Prince,</a>
<a id='line_3315'>  When now they saw their bulwark fallen, stood;</a>
<a id='line_3316'>  On whom the victor, to confound them more,</a>
<a id='line_3317'>  Spurred with his terrible war-cry; for as one,</a>
<a id='line_3318'>  That listens near a torrent mountain-brook,</a>
<a id='line_3319'>  All through the crash of the near cataract hears</a>
<a id='line_3320'>  The drumming thunder of the huger fall</a>
<a id='line_3321'>  At distance, were the soldiers wont to hear</a>
<a id='line_3322'>  His voice in battle, and be kindled by it,</a>
<a id='line_3323'>  And foemen scared, like that false pair who turned</a>
<a id='line_3324'>  Flying, but, overtaken, died the death</a>
<a id='line_3325'>  Themselves had wrought on many an innocent.</a>
<a id='line_3326'></a>
<a id='line_3327'>     Thereon Geraint, dismounting, picked the lance</a>
<a id='line_3328'>  That pleased him best, and drew from those dead wolves</a>
<a id='line_3329'>  Their three gay suits of armour, each from each,</a>
<a id='line_3330'>  And bound them on their horses, each on each,</a>
<a id='line_3331'>  And tied the bridle-reins of all the three</a>
<a id='line_3332'>  Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on</a>
<a id='line_3333'>  Before you,' and she drove them through the wood.</a>
<a id='line_3334'></a>
<a id='line_3335'>     He followed nearer still:  the pain she had</a>
<a id='line_3336'>  To keep them in the wild ways of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3337'>  Two sets of three laden with jingling arms,</a>
<a id='line_3338'>  Together, served a little to disedge</a>
<a id='line_3339'>  The sharpness of that pain about her heart:</a>
<a id='line_3340'>  And they themselves, like creatures gently born</a>
<a id='line_3341'>  But into bad hands fallen, and now so long</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  By bandits groomed, pricked their light ears, and felt</a>
<a id='line_3343'>  Her low firm voice and tender government.</a>
<a id='line_3344'></a>
<a id='line_3345'>     So through the green gloom of the wood they past,</a>
<a id='line_3346'>  And issuing under open heavens beheld</a>
<a id='line_3347'>  A little town with towers, upon a rock,</a>
<a id='line_3348'>  And close beneath, a meadow gemlike chased</a>
<a id='line_3349'>  In the brown wild, and mowers mowing in it:</a>
<a id='line_3350'>  And down a rocky pathway from the place</a>
<a id='line_3351'>  There came a fair-haired youth, that in his hand</a>
<a id='line_3352'>  Bare victual for the mowers:  and Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3353'>  Had ruth again on Enid looking pale:</a>
<a id='line_3354'>  Then, moving downward to the meadow ground,</a>
<a id='line_3355'>  He, when the fair-haired youth came by him, said,</a>
<a id='line_3356'>  'Friend, let her eat; the damsel is so faint.'</a>
<a id='line_3357'>  'Yea, willingly,' replied the youth; 'and thou,</a>
<a id='line_3358'>  My lord, eat also, though the fare is coarse,</a>
<a id='line_3359'>  And only meet for mowers;' then set down</a>
<a id='line_3360'>  His basket, and dismounting on the sward</a>
<a id='line_3361'>  They let the horses graze, and ate themselves.</a>
<a id='line_3362'>  And Enid took a little delicately,</a>
<a id='line_3363'>  Less having stomach for it than desire</a>
<a id='line_3364'>  To close with her lord's pleasure; but Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3365'>  Ate all the mowers' victual unawares,</a>
<a id='line_3366'>  And when he found all empty, was amazed;</a>
<a id='line_3367'>  And 'Boy,' said he, 'I have eaten all, but take</a>
<a id='line_3368'>  A horse and arms for guerdon; choose the best.'</a>
<a id='line_3369'>  He, reddening in extremity of delight,</a>
<a id='line_3370'>  'My lord, you overpay me fifty-fold.'</a>
<a id='line_3371'>  'Ye will be all the wealthier,' cried the Prince.</a>
<a id='line_3372'>  'I take it as free gift, then,' said the boy,</a>
<a id='line_3373'>  'Not guerdon; for myself can easily,</a>
<a id='line_3374'>  While your good damsel rests, return, and fetch</a>
<a id='line_3375'>  Fresh victual for these mowers of our Earl;</a>
<a id='line_3376'>  For these are his, and all the field is his,</a>
<a id='line_3377'>  And I myself am his; and I will tell him</a>
<a id='line_3378'>  How great a man thou art:  he loves to know</a>
<a id='line_3379'>  When men of mark are in his territory:</a>
<a id='line_3380'>  And he will have thee to his palace here,</a>
<a id='line_3381'>  And serve thee costlier than with mowers' fare.'</a>
<a id='line_3382'></a>
<a id='line_3383'>     Then said Geraint, 'I wish no better fare:</a>
<a id='line_3384'>  I never ate with angrier appetite</a>
<a id='line_3385'>  Than when I left your mowers dinnerless.</a>
<a id='line_3386'>  And into no Earl's palace will I go.</a>
<a id='line_3387'>  I know, God knows, too much of palaces!</a>
<a id='line_3388'>  And if he want me, let him come to me.</a>
<a id='line_3389'>  But hire us some fair chamber for the night,</a>
<a id='line_3390'>  And stalling for the horses, and return</a>
<a id='line_3391'>  With victual for these men, and let us know.'</a>
<a id='line_3392'></a>
<a id='line_3393'>     'Yea, my kind lord,' said the glad youth, and went,</a>
<a id='line_3394'>  Held his head high, and thought himself a knight,</a>
<a id='line_3395'>  And up the rocky pathway disappeared,</a>
<a id='line_3396'>  Leading the horse, and they were left alone.</a>
<a id='line_3397'></a>
<a id='line_3398'>     But when the Prince had brought his errant eyes</a>
<a id='line_3399'>  Home from the rock, sideways he let them glance</a>
<a id='line_3400'>  At Enid, where she droopt:  his own false doom,</a>
<a id='line_3401'>  That shadow of mistrust should never cross</a>
<a id='line_3402'>  Betwixt them, came upon him, and he sighed;</a>
<a id='line_3403'>  Then with another humorous ruth remarked</a>
<a id='line_3404'>  The lusty mowers labouring dinnerless,</a>
<a id='line_3405'>  And watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe,</a>
<a id='line_3406'>  And after nodded sleepily in the heat.</a>
<a id='line_3407'>  But she, remembering her old ruined hall,</a>
<a id='line_3408'>  And all the windy clamour of the daws</a>
<a id='line_3409'>  About her hollow turret, plucked the grass</a>
<a id='line_3410'>  There growing longest by the meadow's edge,</a>
<a id='line_3411'>  And into many a listless annulet,</a>
<a id='line_3412'>  Now over, now beneath her marriage ring,</a>
<a id='line_3413'>  Wove and unwove it, till the boy returned</a>
<a id='line_3414'>  And told them of a chamber, and they went;</a>
<a id='line_3415'>  Where, after saying to her, 'If ye will,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>  Call for the woman of the house,' to which</a>
<a id='line_3417'>  She answered, 'Thanks, my lord;' the two remained</a>
<a id='line_3418'>  Apart by all the chamber's width, and mute</a>
<a id='line_3419'>  As two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth,</a>
<a id='line_3420'>  Or two wild men supporters of a shield,</a>
<a id='line_3421'>  Painted, who stare at open space, nor glance</a>
<a id='line_3422'>  The one at other, parted by the shield.</a>
<a id='line_3423'></a>
<a id='line_3424'>     On a sudden, many a voice along the street,</a>
<a id='line_3425'>  And heel against the pavement echoing, burst</a>
<a id='line_3426'>  Their drowse; and either started while the door,</a>
<a id='line_3427'>  Pushed from without, drave backward to the wall,</a>
<a id='line_3428'>  And midmost of a rout of roisterers,</a>
<a id='line_3429'>  Femininely fair and dissolutely pale,</a>
<a id='line_3430'>  Her suitor in old years before Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_3431'>  Entered, the wild lord of the place, Limours.</a>
<a id='line_3432'>  He moving up with pliant courtliness,</a>
<a id='line_3433'>  Greeted Geraint full face, but stealthily,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>  In the mid-warmth of welcome and graspt hand,</a>
<a id='line_3435'>  Found Enid with the corner of his eye,</a>
<a id='line_3436'>  And knew her sitting sad and solitary.</a>
<a id='line_3437'>  Then cried Geraint for wine and goodly cheer</a>
<a id='line_3438'>  To feed the sudden guest, and sumptuously</a>
<a id='line_3439'>  According to his fashion, bad the host</a>
<a id='line_3440'>  Call in what men soever were his friends,</a>
<a id='line_3441'>  And feast with these in honour of their Earl;</a>
<a id='line_3442'>  'And care not for the cost; the cost is mine.'</a>
<a id='line_3443'></a>
<a id='line_3444'>     And wine and food were brought, and Earl Limours</a>
<a id='line_3445'>  Drank till he jested with all ease, and told</a>
<a id='line_3446'>  Free tales, and took the word and played upon it,</a>
<a id='line_3447'>  And made it of two colours; for his talk,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>  When wine and free companions kindled him,</a>
<a id='line_3449'>  Was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem</a>
<a id='line_3450'>  Of fifty facets; thus he moved the Prince</a>
<a id='line_3451'>  To laughter and his comrades to applause.</a>
<a id='line_3452'>  Then, when the Prince was merry, asked Limours,</a>
<a id='line_3453'>  'Your leave, my lord, to cross the room, and speak</a>
<a id='line_3454'>  To your good damsel there who sits apart,</a>
<a id='line_3455'>  And seems so lonely?'  'My free leave,' he said;</a>
<a id='line_3456'>  'Get her to speak:  she doth not speak to me.'</a>
<a id='line_3457'>  Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,</a>
<a id='line_3458'>  Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,</a>
<a id='line_3459'>  Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3460'>  Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:</a>
<a id='line_3461'></a>
<a id='line_3462'>     'Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,</a>
<a id='line_3463'>  Enid, my early and my only love,</a>
<a id='line_3464'>  Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild--</a>
<a id='line_3465'>  What chance is this? how is it I see you here?</a>
<a id='line_3466'>  Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.</a>
<a id='line_3467'>  Yet fear me not:  I call mine own self wild,</a>
<a id='line_3468'>  But keep a touch of sweet civility</a>
<a id='line_3469'>  Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_3470'>  I thought, but that your father came between,</a>
<a id='line_3471'>  In former days you saw me favourably.</a>
<a id='line_3472'>  And if it were so do not keep it back:</a>
<a id='line_3473'>  Make me a little happier:  let me know it:</a>
<a id='line_3474'>  Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?</a>
<a id='line_3475'>  Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.</a>
<a id='line_3476'>  And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,</a>
<a id='line_3477'>  Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,</a>
<a id='line_3478'>  You come with no attendance, page or maid,</a>
<a id='line_3479'>  To serve you--doth he love you as of old?</a>
<a id='line_3480'>  For, call it lovers' quarrels, yet I know</a>
<a id='line_3481'>  Though men may bicker with the things they love,</a>
<a id='line_3482'>  They would not make them laughable in all eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3483'>  Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,</a>
<a id='line_3484'>  A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks</a>
<a id='line_3485'>  Your story, that this man loves you no more.</a>
<a id='line_3486'>  Your beauty is no beauty to him now:</a>
<a id='line_3487'>  A common chance--right well I know it--palled--</a>
<a id='line_3488'>  For I know men:  nor will ye win him back,</a>
<a id='line_3489'>  For the man's love once gone never returns.</a>
<a id='line_3490'>  But here is one who loves you as of old;</a>
<a id='line_3491'>  With more exceeding passion than of old:</a>
<a id='line_3492'>  Good, speak the word:  my followers ring him round:</a>
<a id='line_3493'>  He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;</a>
<a id='line_3494'>  They understand:  nay; I do not mean blood:</a>
<a id='line_3495'>  Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:</a>
<a id='line_3496'>  My malice is no deeper than a moat,</a>
<a id='line_3497'>  No stronger than a wall:  there is the keep;</a>
<a id='line_3498'>  He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:</a>
<a id='line_3499'>  Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me</a>
<a id='line_3500'>  The one true lover whom you ever owned,</a>
<a id='line_3501'>  I will make use of all the power I have.</a>
<a id='line_3502'>  O pardon me! the madness of that hour,</a>
<a id='line_3503'>  When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.'</a>
<a id='line_3504'></a>
<a id='line_3505'>     At this the tender sound of his own voice</a>
<a id='line_3506'>  And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,</a>
<a id='line_3507'>  Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3508'>  Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;</a>
<a id='line_3509'>  And answered with such craft as women use,</a>
<a id='line_3510'>  Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance</a>
<a id='line_3511'>  That breaks upon them perilously, and said:</a>
<a id='line_3512'></a>
<a id='line_3513'>     'Earl, if you love me as in former years,</a>
<a id='line_3514'>  And do not practise on me, come with morn,</a>
<a id='line_3515'>  And snatch me from him as by violence;</a>
<a id='line_3516'>  Leave me tonight:  I am weary to the death.'</a>
<a id='line_3517'></a>
<a id='line_3518'>     Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume</a>
<a id='line_3519'>  Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,</a>
<a id='line_3520'>  And the stout Prince bad him a loud good-night.</a>
<a id='line_3521'>  He moving homeward babbled to his men,</a>
<a id='line_3522'>  How Enid never loved a man but him,</a>
<a id='line_3523'>  Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.</a>
<a id='line_3524'></a>
<a id='line_3525'>     But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_3526'>  Debating his command of silence given,</a>
<a id='line_3527'>  And that she now perforce must violate it,</a>
<a id='line_3528'>  Held commune with herself, and while she held</a>
<a id='line_3529'>  He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart</a>
<a id='line_3530'>  To wake him, but hung o'er him, wholly pleased</a>
<a id='line_3531'>  To find him yet unwounded after fight,</a>
<a id='line_3532'>  And hear him breathing low and equally.</a>
<a id='line_3533'>  Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped</a>
<a id='line_3534'>  The pieces of his armour in one place,</a>
<a id='line_3535'>  All to be there against a sudden need;</a>
<a id='line_3536'>  Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled</a>
<a id='line_3537'>  By that day's grief and travel, evermore</a>
<a id='line_3538'>  Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then</a>
<a id='line_3539'>  Went slipping down horrible precipices,</a>
<a id='line_3540'>  And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;</a>
<a id='line_3541'>  Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,</a>
<a id='line_3542'>  With all his rout of random followers,</a>
<a id='line_3543'>  Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;</a>
<a id='line_3544'>  Which was the red cock shouting to the light,</a>
<a id='line_3545'>  As the gray dawn stole o'er the dewy world,</a>
<a id='line_3546'>  And glimmered on his armour in the room.</a>
<a id='line_3547'>  And once again she rose to look at it,</a>
<a id='line_3548'>  But touched it unawares:  jangling, the casque</a>
<a id='line_3549'>  Fell, and he started up and stared at her.</a>
<a id='line_3550'>  Then breaking his command of silence given,</a>
<a id='line_3551'>  She told him all that Earl Limours had said,</a>
<a id='line_3552'>  Except the passage that he loved her not;</a>
<a id='line_3553'>  Nor left untold the craft herself had used;</a>
<a id='line_3554'>  But ended with apology so sweet,</a>
<a id='line_3555'>  Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed</a>
<a id='line_3556'>  So justified by that necessity,</a>
<a id='line_3557'>  That though he thought 'was it for him she wept</a>
<a id='line_3558'>  In Devon?' he but gave a wrathful groan,</a>
<a id='line_3559'>  Saying, 'Your sweet faces make good fellows fools</a>
<a id='line_3560'>  And traitors.  Call the host and bid him bring</a>
<a id='line_3561'>  Charger and palfrey.'  So she glided out</a>
<a id='line_3562'>  Among the heavy breathings of the house,</a>
<a id='line_3563'>  And like a household Spirit at the walls</a>
<a id='line_3564'>  Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:</a>
<a id='line_3565'>  Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,</a>
<a id='line_3566'>  In silence, did him service as a squire;</a>
<a id='line_3567'>  Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,</a>
<a id='line_3568'>  'Thy reckoning, friend?' and ere he learnt it, 'Take</a>
<a id='line_3569'>  Five horses and their armours;' and the host</a>
<a id='line_3570'>  Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,</a>
<a id='line_3571'>  'My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!'</a>
<a id='line_3572'>  'Ye will be all the wealthier,' said the Prince,</a>
<a id='line_3573'>  And then to Enid, 'Forward! and today</a>
<a id='line_3574'>  I charge you, Enid, more especially,</a>
<a id='line_3575'>  What thing soever ye may hear, or see,</a>
<a id='line_3576'>  Or fancy (though I count it of small use</a>
<a id='line_3577'>  To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.'</a>
<a id='line_3578'></a>
<a id='line_3579'>     And Enid answered, 'Yea, my lord, I know</a>
<a id='line_3580'>  Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,</a>
<a id='line_3581'>  I hear the violent threats you do not hear,</a>
<a id='line_3582'>  I see the danger which you cannot see:</a>
<a id='line_3583'>  Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;</a>
<a id='line_3584'>  Almost beyond me:  yet I would obey.'</a>
<a id='line_3585'></a>
<a id='line_3586'>     'Yea so,' said he, 'do it:  be not too wise;</a>
<a id='line_3587'>  Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,</a>
<a id='line_3588'>  Not all mismated with a yawning clown,</a>
<a id='line_3589'>  But one with arms to guard his head and yours,</a>
<a id='line_3590'>  With eyes to find you out however far,</a>
<a id='line_3591'>  And ears to hear you even in his dreams.'</a>
<a id='line_3592'></a>
<a id='line_3593'>     With that he turned and looked as keenly at her</a>
<a id='line_3594'>  As careful robins eye the delver's toil;</a>
<a id='line_3595'>  And that within her, which a wanton fool,</a>
<a id='line_3596'>  Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,</a>
<a id='line_3597'>  Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.</a>
<a id='line_3598'>  And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.</a>
<a id='line_3599'></a>
<a id='line_3600'>     Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,</a>
<a id='line_3601'>  Led from the territory of false Limours</a>
<a id='line_3602'>  To the waste earldom of another earl,</a>
<a id='line_3603'>  Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,</a>
<a id='line_3604'>  Went Enid with her sullen follower on.</a>
<a id='line_3605'>  Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride</a>
<a id='line_3606'>  More near by many a rood than yestermorn,</a>
<a id='line_3607'>  It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3608'>  Waving an angry hand as who should say</a>
<a id='line_3609'>  'Ye watch me,' saddened all her heart again.</a>
<a id='line_3610'>  But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,</a>
<a id='line_3611'>  The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof</a>
<a id='line_3612'>  Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw</a>
<a id='line_3613'>  Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.</a>
<a id='line_3614'>  Then not to disobey her lord's behest,</a>
<a id='line_3615'>  And yet to give him warning, for he rode</a>
<a id='line_3616'>  As if he heard not, moving back she held</a>
<a id='line_3617'>  Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.</a>
<a id='line_3618'>  At which the warrior in his obstinacy,</a>
<a id='line_3619'>  Because she kept the letter of his word,</a>
<a id='line_3620'>  Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.</a>
<a id='line_3621'>  And in the moment after, wild Limours,</a>
<a id='line_3622'>  Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud</a>
<a id='line_3623'>  Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,</a>
<a id='line_3624'>  Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,</a>
<a id='line_3625'>  And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,</a>
<a id='line_3626'>  Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore</a>
<a id='line_3627'>  Down by the length of lance and arm beyond</a>
<a id='line_3628'>  The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,</a>
<a id='line_3629'>  And overthrew the next that followed him,</a>
<a id='line_3630'>  And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.</a>
<a id='line_3631'>  But at the flash and motion of the man</a>
<a id='line_3632'>  They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal</a>
<a id='line_3633'>  Of darting fish, that on a summer morn</a>
<a id='line_3634'>  Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot</a>
<a id='line_3635'>  Come slipping o'er their shadows on the sand,</a>
<a id='line_3636'>  But if a man who stands upon the brink</a>
<a id='line_3637'>  But lift a shining hand against the sun,</a>
<a id='line_3638'>  There is not left the twinkle of a fin</a>
<a id='line_3639'>  Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;</a>
<a id='line_3640'>  So, scared but at the motion of the man,</a>
<a id='line_3641'>  Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,</a>
<a id='line_3642'>  And left him lying in the public way;</a>
<a id='line_3643'>  So vanish friendships only made in wine.</a>
<a id='line_3644'></a>
<a id='line_3645'>     Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_3646'>  Who saw the chargers of the two that fell</a>
<a id='line_3647'>  Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,</a>
<a id='line_3648'>  Mixt with the flyers.  'Horse and man,' he said,</a>
<a id='line_3649'>  'All of one mind and all right-honest friends!</a>
<a id='line_3650'>  Not a hoof left:  and I methinks till now</a>
<a id='line_3651'>  Was honest--paid with horses and with arms;</a>
<a id='line_3652'>  I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:</a>
<a id='line_3653'>  And so what say ye, shall we strip him there</a>
<a id='line_3654'>  Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough</a>
<a id='line_3655'>  To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?</a>
<a id='line_3656'>  No?--then do thou, being right honest, pray</a>
<a id='line_3657'>  That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,</a>
<a id='line_3658'>  I too would still be honest.'  Thus he said:</a>
<a id='line_3659'>  And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,</a>
<a id='line_3660'>  And answering not one word, she led the way.</a>
<a id='line_3661'></a>
<a id='line_3662'>     But as a man to whom a dreadful loss</a>
<a id='line_3663'>  Falls in a far land and he knows it not,</a>
<a id='line_3664'>  But coming back he learns it, and the loss</a>
<a id='line_3665'>  So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;</a>
<a id='line_3666'>  So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked</a>
<a id='line_3667'>  In combat with the follower of Limours,</a>
<a id='line_3668'>  Bled underneath his armour secretly,</a>
<a id='line_3669'>  And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife</a>
<a id='line_3670'>  What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,</a>
<a id='line_3671'>  Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;</a>
<a id='line_3672'>  And at a sudden swerving of the road,</a>
<a id='line_3673'>  Though happily down on a bank of grass,</a>
<a id='line_3674'>  The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.</a>
<a id='line_3675'></a>
<a id='line_3676'>     And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,</a>
<a id='line_3677'>  Suddenly came, and at his side all pale</a>
<a id='line_3678'>  Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,</a>
<a id='line_3679'>  Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye</a>
<a id='line_3680'>  Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,</a>
<a id='line_3681'>  And tearing off her veil of faded silk</a>
<a id='line_3682'>  Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,</a>
<a id='line_3683'>  And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord's life.</a>
<a id='line_3684'>  Then after all was done that hand could do,</a>
<a id='line_3685'>  She rested, and her desolation came</a>
<a id='line_3686'>  Upon her, and she wept beside the way.</a>
<a id='line_3687'></a>
<a id='line_3688'>     And many past, but none regarded her,</a>
<a id='line_3689'>  For in that realm of lawless turbulence,</a>
<a id='line_3690'>  A woman weeping for her murdered mate</a>
<a id='line_3691'>  Was cared as much for as a summer shower:</a>
<a id='line_3692'>  One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,</a>
<a id='line_3693'>  Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:</a>
<a id='line_3694'>  Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,</a>
<a id='line_3695'>  Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;</a>
<a id='line_3696'>  Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>  He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:</a>
<a id='line_3698'>  Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm</a>
<a id='line_3699'>  Before an ever-fancied arrow, made</a>
<a id='line_3700'>  The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;</a>
<a id='line_3701'>  At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,</a>
<a id='line_3702'>  And scoured into the coppices and was lost,</a>
<a id='line_3703'>  While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.</a>
<a id='line_3704'></a>
<a id='line_3705'>     But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,</a>
<a id='line_3706'>  Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,</a>
<a id='line_3707'>  Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,</a>
<a id='line_3708'>  Came riding with a hundred lances up;</a>
<a id='line_3709'>  But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,</a>
<a id='line_3710'>  Cried out with a big voice, 'What, is he dead?'</a>
<a id='line_3711'>  'No, no, not dead!' she answered in all haste.</a>
<a id='line_3712'>  'Would some of your people take him up,</a>
<a id='line_3713'>  And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?</a>
<a id='line_3714'>  Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.'</a>
<a id='line_3715'></a>
<a id='line_3716'>     Then said Earl Doorm:  'Well, if he be not dead,</a>
<a id='line_3717'>  Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.</a>
<a id='line_3718'>  And be he dead, I count you for a fool;</a>
<a id='line_3719'>  Your wailing will not quicken him:  dead or not,</a>
<a id='line_3720'>  Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.</a>
<a id='line_3721'>  Yet, since the face is comely--some of you,</a>
<a id='line_3722'>  Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:</a>
<a id='line_3723'>  An if he live, we will have him of our band;</a>
<a id='line_3724'>  And if he die, why earth has earth enough</a>
<a id='line_3725'>  To hide him.  See ye take the charger too,</a>
<a id='line_3726'>  A noble one.'</a>
<a id='line_3727'>               He spake, and past away,</a>
<a id='line_3728'>  But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,</a>
<a id='line_3729'>  Each growling like a dog, when his good bone</a>
<a id='line_3730'>  Seems to be plucked at by the village boys</a>
<a id='line_3731'>  Who love to vex him eating, and he fears</a>
<a id='line_3732'>  To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,</a>
<a id='line_3733'>  Gnawing and growling:  so the ruffians growled,</a>
<a id='line_3734'>  Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,</a>
<a id='line_3735'>  Their chance of booty from the morning's raid,</a>
<a id='line_3736'>  Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,</a>
<a id='line_3737'>  Such as they brought upon their forays out</a>
<a id='line_3738'>  For those that might be wounded; laid him on it</a>
<a id='line_3739'>  All in the hollow of his shield, and took</a>
<a id='line_3740'>  And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>  (His gentle charger following him unled)</a>
<a id='line_3742'>  And cast him and the bier in which he lay</a>
<a id='line_3743'>  Down on an oaken settle in the hall,</a>
<a id='line_3744'>  And then departed, hot in haste to join</a>
<a id='line_3745'>  Their luckier mates, but growling as before,</a>
<a id='line_3746'>  And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,</a>
<a id='line_3747'>  And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.</a>
<a id='line_3748'>  They might as well have blest her:  she was deaf</a>
<a id='line_3749'>  To blessing or to cursing save from one.</a>
<a id='line_3750'></a>
<a id='line_3751'>     So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>  There in the naked hall, propping his head,</a>
<a id='line_3753'>  And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.</a>
<a id='line_3754'>  Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,</a>
<a id='line_3755'>  And found his own dear bride propping his head,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>  And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;</a>
<a id='line_3757'>  And felt the warm tears falling on his face;</a>
<a id='line_3758'>  And said to his own heart, 'She weeps for me:'</a>
<a id='line_3759'>  And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,</a>
<a id='line_3760'>  That he might prove her to the uttermost,</a>
<a id='line_3761'>  And say to his own heart, 'She weeps for me.'</a>
<a id='line_3762'></a>
<a id='line_3763'>     But in the falling afternoon returned</a>
<a id='line_3764'>  The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.</a>
<a id='line_3765'>  His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:</a>
<a id='line_3766'>  Each hurling down a heap of things that rang</a>
<a id='line_3767'>  Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,</a>
<a id='line_3768'>  And doffed his helm:  and then there fluttered in,</a>
<a id='line_3769'>  Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3770'>  A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,</a>
<a id='line_3771'>  And mingled with the spearmen:  and Earl Doorm</a>
<a id='line_3772'>  Struck with a knife's haft hard against the board,</a>
<a id='line_3773'>  And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.</a>
<a id='line_3774'>  And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,</a>
<a id='line_3775'>  And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:</a>
<a id='line_3776'>  And none spake word, but all sat down at once,</a>
<a id='line_3777'>  And ate with tumult in the naked hall,</a>
<a id='line_3778'>  Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;</a>
<a id='line_3779'>  Till Enid shrank far back into herself,</a>
<a id='line_3780'>  To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.</a>
<a id='line_3781'>  But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,</a>
<a id='line_3782'>  He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found</a>
<a id='line_3783'>  A damsel drooping in a corner of it.</a>
<a id='line_3784'>  Then he remembered her, and how she wept;</a>
<a id='line_3785'>  And out of her there came a power upon him;</a>
<a id='line_3786'>  And rising on the sudden he said, 'Eat!</a>
<a id='line_3787'>  I never yet beheld a thing so pale.</a>
<a id='line_3788'>  God's curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.</a>
<a id='line_3789'>  Eat!  Look yourself.  Good luck had your good man,</a>
<a id='line_3790'>  For were I dead who is it would weep for me?</a>
<a id='line_3791'>  Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath</a>
<a id='line_3792'>  Have I beheld a lily like yourself.</a>
<a id='line_3793'>  And so there lived some colour in your cheek,</a>
<a id='line_3794'>  There is not one among my gentlewomen</a>
<a id='line_3795'>  Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.</a>
<a id='line_3796'>  But listen to me, and by me be ruled,</a>
<a id='line_3797'>  And I will do the thing I have not done,</a>
<a id='line_3798'>  For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,</a>
<a id='line_3799'>  And we will live like two birds in one nest,</a>
<a id='line_3800'>  And I will fetch you forage from all fields,</a>
<a id='line_3801'>  For I compel all creatures to my will.'</a>
<a id='line_3802'></a>
<a id='line_3803'>     He spoke:  the brawny spearman let his cheek</a>
<a id='line_3804'>  Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;</a>
<a id='line_3805'>  While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn</a>
<a id='line_3806'>  Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf</a>
<a id='line_3807'>  And makes it earth, hissed each at other's ear</a>
<a id='line_3808'>  What shall not be recorded--women they,</a>
<a id='line_3809'>  Women, or what had been those gracious things,</a>
<a id='line_3810'>  But now desired the humbling of their best,</a>
<a id='line_3811'>  Yea, would have helped him to it:  and all at once</a>
<a id='line_3812'>  They hated her, who took no thought of them,</a>
<a id='line_3813'>  But answered in low voice, her meek head yet</a>
<a id='line_3814'>  Drooping, 'I pray you of your courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_3815'>  He being as he is, to let me be.'</a>
<a id='line_3816'></a>
<a id='line_3817'>     She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,</a>
<a id='line_3818'>  But like a mighty patron, satisfied</a>
<a id='line_3819'>  With what himself had done so graciously,</a>
<a id='line_3820'>  Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, 'Yea,</a>
<a id='line_3821'>  Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.'</a>
<a id='line_3822'></a>
<a id='line_3823'>     She answered meekly, 'How should I be glad</a>
<a id='line_3824'>  Henceforth in all the world at anything,</a>
<a id='line_3825'>  Until my lord arise and look upon me?'</a>
<a id='line_3826'></a>
<a id='line_3827'>     Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>  As all but empty heart and weariness</a>
<a id='line_3829'>  And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,</a>
<a id='line_3830'>  And bare her by main violence to the board,</a>
<a id='line_3831'>  And thrust the dish before her, crying, 'Eat.'</a>
<a id='line_3832'></a>
<a id='line_3833'>     'No, no,' said Enid, vext, 'I will not eat</a>
<a id='line_3834'>  Till yonder man upon the bier arise,</a>
<a id='line_3835'>  And eat with me.'  'Drink, then,' he answered.  'Here!'</a>
<a id='line_3836'>  (And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)</a>
<a id='line_3837'>  'Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,</a>
<a id='line_3838'>  God's curse, with anger--often I myself,</a>
<a id='line_3839'>  Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:</a>
<a id='line_3840'>  Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.'</a>
<a id='line_3841'></a>
<a id='line_3842'>     'Not so,' she cried, 'by Heaven, I will not drink</a>
<a id='line_3843'>  Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,</a>
<a id='line_3844'>  And drink with me; and if he rise no more,</a>
<a id='line_3845'>  I will not look at wine until I die.'</a>
<a id='line_3846'></a>
<a id='line_3847'>     At this he turned all red and paced his hall,</a>
<a id='line_3848'>  Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,</a>
<a id='line_3849'>  And coming up close to her, said at last:</a>
<a id='line_3850'>  'Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,</a>
<a id='line_3851'>  Take warning:  yonder man is surely dead;</a>
<a id='line_3852'>  And I compel all creatures to my will.</a>
<a id='line_3853'>  Not eat nor drink?  And wherefore wail for one,</a>
<a id='line_3854'>  Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn</a>
<a id='line_3855'>  By dressing it in rags?  Amazed am I,</a>
<a id='line_3856'>  Beholding how ye butt against my wish,</a>
<a id='line_3857'>  That I forbear you thus:  cross me no more.</a>
<a id='line_3858'>  At least put off to please me this poor gown,</a>
<a id='line_3859'>  This silken rag, this beggar-woman's weed:</a>
<a id='line_3860'>  I love that beauty should go beautifully:</a>
<a id='line_3861'>  For see ye not my gentlewomen here,</a>
<a id='line_3862'>  How gay, how suited to the house of one</a>
<a id='line_3863'>  Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?</a>
<a id='line_3864'>  Rise therefore; robe yourself in this:  obey.'</a>
<a id='line_3865'></a>
<a id='line_3866'>     He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen</a>
<a id='line_3867'>  Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,</a>
<a id='line_3868'>  Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue</a>
<a id='line_3869'>  Played into green, and thicker down the front</a>
<a id='line_3870'>  With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,</a>
<a id='line_3871'>  When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,</a>
<a id='line_3872'>  And with the dawn ascending lets the day</a>
<a id='line_3873'>  Strike where it clung:  so thickly shone the gems.</a>
<a id='line_3874'></a>
<a id='line_3875'>     But Enid answered, harder to be moved</a>
<a id='line_3876'>  Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,</a>
<a id='line_3877'>  With life-long injuries burning unavenged,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>  And now their hour has come; and Enid said:</a>
<a id='line_3879'></a>
<a id='line_3880'>     'In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,</a>
<a id='line_3881'>  And loved me serving in my father's hall:</a>
<a id='line_3882'>  In this poor gown I rode with him to court,</a>
<a id='line_3883'>  And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:</a>
<a id='line_3884'>  In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>  When now we rode upon this fatal quest</a>
<a id='line_3886'>  Of honour, where no honour can be gained:</a>
<a id='line_3887'>  And this poor gown I will not cast aside</a>
<a id='line_3888'>  Until himself arise a living man,</a>
<a id='line_3889'>  And bid me cast it.  I have griefs enough:</a>
<a id='line_3890'>  Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:</a>
<a id='line_3891'>  I never loved, can never love but him:</a>
<a id='line_3892'>  Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,</a>
<a id='line_3893'>  He being as he is, to let me be.'</a>
<a id='line_3894'></a>
<a id='line_3895'>     Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,</a>
<a id='line_3896'>  And took his russet beard between his teeth;</a>
<a id='line_3897'>  Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood</a>
<a id='line_3898'>  Crying, 'I count it of no more avail,</a>
<a id='line_3899'>  Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;</a>
<a id='line_3900'>  Take my salute,' unknightly with flat hand,</a>
<a id='line_3901'>  However lightly, smote her on the cheek.</a>
<a id='line_3902'></a>
<a id='line_3903'>     Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,</a>
<a id='line_3904'>  And since she thought, 'He had not dared to do it,</a>
<a id='line_3905'>  Except he surely knew my lord was dead,'</a>
<a id='line_3906'>  Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,</a>
<a id='line_3907'>  As of a wild thing taken in the trap,</a>
<a id='line_3908'>  Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>     This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,</a>
<a id='line_3911'>  (It lay beside him in the hollow shield),</a>
<a id='line_3912'>  Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it</a>
<a id='line_3913'>  Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball</a>
<a id='line_3914'>  The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.</a>
<a id='line_3915'>  So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.</a>
<a id='line_3916'>  And all the men and women in the hall</a>
<a id='line_3917'>  Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled</a>
<a id='line_3918'>  Yelling as from a spectre, and the two</a>
<a id='line_3919'>  Were left alone together, and he said:</a>
<a id='line_3920'></a>
<a id='line_3921'>     'Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;</a>
<a id='line_3922'>  Done you more wrong:  we both have undergone</a>
<a id='line_3923'>  That trouble which has left me thrice your own:</a>
<a id='line_3924'>  Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.</a>
<a id='line_3925'>  And here I lay this penance on myself,</a>
<a id='line_3926'>  Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn--</a>
<a id='line_3927'>  You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,</a>
<a id='line_3928'>  I heard you say, that you were no true wife:</a>
<a id='line_3929'>  I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:</a>
<a id='line_3930'>  I do believe yourself against yourself,</a>
<a id='line_3931'>  And will henceforward rather die than doubt.'</a>
<a id='line_3932'></a>
<a id='line_3933'>     And Enid could not say one tender word,</a>
<a id='line_3934'>  She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:</a>
<a id='line_3935'>  She only prayed him, 'Fly, they will return</a>
<a id='line_3936'>  And slay you; fly, your charger is without,</a>
<a id='line_3937'>  My palfrey lost.'  'Then, Enid, shall you ride</a>
<a id='line_3938'>  Behind me.'  'Yea,' said Enid, 'let us go.'</a>
<a id='line_3939'>  And moving out they found the stately horse,</a>
<a id='line_3940'>  Who now no more a vassal to the thief,</a>
<a id='line_3941'>  But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,</a>
<a id='line_3942'>  Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped</a>
<a id='line_3943'>  With a low whinny toward the pair:  and she</a>
<a id='line_3944'>  Kissed the white star upon his noble front,</a>
<a id='line_3945'>  Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse</a>
<a id='line_3946'>  Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot</a>
<a id='line_3947'>  She set her own and climbed; he turned his face</a>
<a id='line_3948'>  And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms</a>
<a id='line_3949'>  About him, and at once they rode away.</a>
<a id='line_3950'></a>
<a id='line_3951'>     And never yet, since high in Paradise</a>
<a id='line_3952'>  O'er the four rivers the first roses blew,</a>
<a id='line_3953'>  Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind</a>
<a id='line_3954'>  Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour</a>
<a id='line_3955'>  Put hand to hand beneath her husband's heart,</a>
<a id='line_3956'>  And felt him hers again:  she did not weep,</a>
<a id='line_3957'>  But o'er her meek eyes came a happy mist</a>
<a id='line_3958'>  Like that which kept the heart of Eden green</a>
<a id='line_3959'>  Before the useful trouble of the rain:</a>
<a id='line_3960'>  Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes</a>
<a id='line_3961'>  As not to see before them on the path,</a>
<a id='line_3962'>  Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,</a>
<a id='line_3963'>  A knight of Arthur's court, who laid his lance</a>
<a id='line_3964'>  In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.</a>
<a id='line_3965'>  Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,</a>
<a id='line_3966'>  She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,</a>
<a id='line_3967'>  Shrieked to the stranger 'Slay not a dead man!'</a>
<a id='line_3968'>  'The voice of Enid,' said the knight; but she,</a>
<a id='line_3969'>  Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,</a>
<a id='line_3970'>  Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,</a>
<a id='line_3971'>  'O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.'</a>
<a id='line_3972'>  And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:</a>
<a id='line_3973'>  'My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;</a>
<a id='line_3974'>  I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;</a>
<a id='line_3975'>  And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,</a>
<a id='line_3976'>  Who love you, Prince, with something of the love</a>
<a id='line_3977'>  Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.</a>
<a id='line_3978'>  For once, when I was up so high in pride</a>
<a id='line_3979'>  That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,</a>
<a id='line_3980'>  By overthrowing me you threw me higher.</a>
<a id='line_3981'>  Now, made a knight of Arthur's Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_3982'>  And since I knew this Earl, when I myself</a>
<a id='line_3983'>  Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,</a>
<a id='line_3984'>  I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm</a>
<a id='line_3985'>  (The King is close behind me) bidding him</a>
<a id='line_3986'>  Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,</a>
<a id='line_3987'>  Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.'</a>
<a id='line_3988'></a>
<a id='line_3989'>     'He hears the judgment of the King of kings,'</a>
<a id='line_3990'>  Cried the wan Prince; 'and lo, the powers of Doorm</a>
<a id='line_3991'>  Are scattered,' and he pointed to the field,</a>
<a id='line_3992'>  Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,</a>
<a id='line_3993'>  Were men and women staring and aghast,</a>
<a id='line_3994'>  While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told</a>
<a id='line_3995'>  How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.</a>
<a id='line_3996'>  But when the knight besought him, 'Follow me,</a>
<a id='line_3997'>  Prince, to the camp, and in the King's own ear</a>
<a id='line_3998'>  Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured</a>
<a id='line_3999'>  Strange chances here alone;' that other flushed,</a>
<a id='line_4000'>  And hung his head, and halted in reply,</a>
<a id='line_4001'>  Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,</a>
<a id='line_4002'>  And after madness acted question asked:</a>
<a id='line_4003'>  Till Edyrn crying, 'If ye will not go</a>
<a id='line_4004'>  To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,'</a>
<a id='line_4005'>  'Enough,' he said, 'I follow,' and they went.</a>
<a id='line_4006'>  But Enid in their going had two fears,</a>
<a id='line_4007'>  One from the bandit scattered in the field,</a>
<a id='line_4008'>  And one from Edyrn.  Every now and then,</a>
<a id='line_4009'>  When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,</a>
<a id='line_4010'>  She shrank a little.  In a hollow land,</a>
<a id='line_4011'>  From which old fires have broken, men may fear</a>
<a id='line_4012'>  Fresh fire and ruin.  He, perceiving, said:</a>
<a id='line_4013'></a>
<a id='line_4014'>     'Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause</a>
<a id='line_4015'>  To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.</a>
<a id='line_4016'>  Yourself were first the blameless cause to make</a>
<a id='line_4017'>  My nature's prideful sparkle in the blood</a>
<a id='line_4018'>  Break into furious flame; being repulsed</a>
<a id='line_4019'>  By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought</a>
<a id='line_4020'>  Until I overturned him; then set up</a>
<a id='line_4021'>  (With one main purpose ever at my heart)</a>
<a id='line_4022'>  My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;</a>
<a id='line_4023'>  Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,</a>
<a id='line_4024'>  And, toppling over all antagonism,</a>
<a id='line_4025'>  So waxed in pride, that I believed myself</a>
<a id='line_4026'>  Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:</a>
<a id='line_4027'>  And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,</a>
<a id='line_4028'>  I should have slain your father, seized yourself.</a>
<a id='line_4029'>  I lived in hope that sometime you would come</a>
<a id='line_4030'>  To these my lists with him whom best you loved;</a>
<a id='line_4031'>  And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes</a>
<a id='line_4032'>  The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4033'>  Behold me overturn and trample on him.</a>
<a id='line_4034'>  Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,</a>
<a id='line_4035'>  I should not less have killed him.  And so you came,--</a>
<a id='line_4036'>  But once you came,--and with your own true eyes</a>
<a id='line_4037'>  Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one</a>
<a id='line_4038'>  Speaks of a service done him) overthrow</a>
<a id='line_4039'>  My proud self, and my purpose three years old,</a>
<a id='line_4040'>  And set his foot upon me, and give me life.</a>
<a id='line_4041'>  There was I broken down; there was I saved:</a>
<a id='line_4042'>  Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life</a>
<a id='line_4043'>  He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.</a>
<a id='line_4044'>  And all the penance the Queen laid upon me</a>
<a id='line_4045'>  Was but to rest awhile within her court;</a>
<a id='line_4046'>  Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,</a>
<a id='line_4047'>  And waiting to be treated like a wolf,</a>
<a id='line_4048'>  Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,</a>
<a id='line_4049'>  Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,</a>
<a id='line_4050'>  Such fine reserve and noble reticence,</a>
<a id='line_4051'>  Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace</a>
<a id='line_4052'>  Of tenderest courtesy, that I began</a>
<a id='line_4053'>  To glance behind me at my former life,</a>
<a id='line_4054'>  And find that it had been the wolf's indeed:</a>
<a id='line_4055'>  And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,</a>
<a id='line_4056'>  Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,</a>
<a id='line_4057'>  Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,</a>
<a id='line_4058'>  Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.</a>
<a id='line_4059'>  And you were often there about the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_4060'>  But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;</a>
<a id='line_4061'>  Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,</a>
<a id='line_4062'>  But kept myself aloof till I was changed;</a>
<a id='line_4063'>  And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.'</a>
<a id='line_4064'></a>
<a id='line_4065'>     He spoke, and Enid easily believed,</a>
<a id='line_4066'>  Like simple noble natures, credulous</a>
<a id='line_4067'>  Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,</a>
<a id='line_4068'>  There most in those who most have done them ill.</a>
<a id='line_4069'>  And when they reached the camp the King himself</a>
<a id='line_4070'>  Advanced to greet them, and beholding her</a>
<a id='line_4071'>  Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,</a>
<a id='line_4072'>  But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held</a>
<a id='line_4073'>  In converse for a little, and returned,</a>
<a id='line_4074'>  And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,</a>
<a id='line_4075'>  And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,</a>
<a id='line_4076'>  And showed an empty tent allotted her,</a>
<a id='line_4077'>  And glancing for a minute, till he saw her</a>
<a id='line_4078'>  Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:</a>
<a id='line_4079'></a>
<a id='line_4080'>     'Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave</a>
<a id='line_4081'>  To move to your own land, and there defend</a>
<a id='line_4082'>  Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,</a>
<a id='line_4083'>  As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,</a>
<a id='line_4084'>  By having looked too much through alien eyes,</a>
<a id='line_4085'>  And wrought too long with delegated hands,</a>
<a id='line_4086'>  Not used mine own:  but now behold me come</a>
<a id='line_4087'>  To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,</a>
<a id='line_4088'>  With Edyrn and with others:  have ye looked</a>
<a id='line_4089'>  At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?</a>
<a id='line_4090'>  This work of his is great and wonderful.</a>
<a id='line_4091'>  His very face with change of heart is changed.</a>
<a id='line_4092'>  The world will not believe a man repents:</a>
<a id='line_4093'>  And this wise world of ours is mainly right.</a>
<a id='line_4094'>  Full seldom doth a man repent, or use</a>
<a id='line_4095'>  Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch</a>
<a id='line_4096'>  Of blood and custom wholly out of him,</a>
<a id='line_4097'>  And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.</a>
<a id='line_4098'>  Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart</a>
<a id='line_4099'>  As I will weed this land before I go.</a>
<a id='line_4100'>  I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_4101'>  Not rashly, but have proved him everyway</a>
<a id='line_4102'>  One of our noblest, our most valorous,</a>
<a id='line_4103'>  Sanest and most obedient:  and indeed</a>
<a id='line_4104'>  This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself</a>
<a id='line_4105'>  After a life of violence, seems to me</a>
<a id='line_4106'>  A thousand-fold more great and wonderful</a>
<a id='line_4107'>  Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,</a>
<a id='line_4108'>  My subject with my subjects under him,</a>
<a id='line_4109'>  Should make an onslaught single on a realm</a>
<a id='line_4110'>  Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,</a>
<a id='line_4111'>  And were himself nigh wounded to the death.'</a>
<a id='line_4112'></a>
<a id='line_4113'>     So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt</a>
<a id='line_4114'>  His work was neither great nor wonderful,</a>
<a id='line_4115'>  And past to Enid's tent; and thither came</a>
<a id='line_4116'>  The King's own leech to look into his hurt;</a>
<a id='line_4117'>  And Enid tended on him there; and there</a>
<a id='line_4118'>  Her constant motion round him, and the breath</a>
<a id='line_4119'>  Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,</a>
<a id='line_4120'>  Filled all the genial courses of his blood</a>
<a id='line_4121'>  With deeper and with ever deeper love,</a>
<a id='line_4122'>  As the south-west that blowing Bala lake</a>
<a id='line_4123'>  Fills all the sacred Dee.  So past the days.</a>
<a id='line_4124'></a>
<a id='line_4125'>     But while Geraint lay healing of his hurt,</a>
<a id='line_4126'>  The blameless King went forth and cast his eyes</a>
<a id='line_4127'>  On each of all whom Uther left in charge</a>
<a id='line_4128'>  Long since, to guard the justice of the King:</a>
<a id='line_4129'>  He looked and found them wanting; and as now</a>
<a id='line_4130'>  Men weed the white horse on the Berkshire hills</a>
<a id='line_4131'>  To keep him bright and clean as heretofore,</a>
<a id='line_4132'>  He rooted out the slothful officer</a>
<a id='line_4133'>  Or guilty, which for bribe had winked at wrong,</a>
<a id='line_4134'>  And in their chairs set up a stronger race</a>
<a id='line_4135'>  With hearts and hands, and sent a thousand men</a>
<a id='line_4136'>  To till the wastes, and moving everywhere</a>
<a id='line_4137'>  Cleared the dark places and let in the law,</a>
<a id='line_4138'>  And broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land.</a>
<a id='line_4139'></a>
<a id='line_4140'>     Then, when Geraint was whole again, they past</a>
<a id='line_4141'>  With Arthur to Caerleon upon Usk.</a>
<a id='line_4142'>  There the great Queen once more embraced her friend,</a>
<a id='line_4143'>  And clothed her in apparel like the day.</a>
<a id='line_4144'>  And though Geraint could never take again</a>
<a id='line_4145'>  That comfort from their converse which he took</a>
<a id='line_4146'>  Before the Queen's fair name was breathed upon,</a>
<a id='line_4147'>  He rested well content that all was well.</a>
<a id='line_4148'>  Thence after tarrying for a space they rode,</a>
<a id='line_4149'>  And fifty knights rode with them to the shores</a>
<a id='line_4150'>  Of Severn, and they past to their own land.</a>
<a id='line_4151'>  And there he kept the justice of the King</a>
<a id='line_4152'>  So vigorously yet mildly, that all hearts</a>
<a id='line_4153'>  Applauded, and the spiteful whisper died:</a>
<a id='line_4154'>  And being ever foremost in the chase,</a>
<a id='line_4155'>  And victor at the tilt and tournament,</a>
<a id='line_4156'>  They called him the great Prince and man of men.</a>
<a id='line_4157'>  But Enid, whom her ladies loved to call</a>
<a id='line_4158'>  Enid the Fair, a grateful people named</a>
<a id='line_4159'>  Enid the Good; and in their halls arose</a>
<a id='line_4160'>  The cry of children, Enids and Geraints</a>
<a id='line_4161'>  Of times to be; nor did he doubt her more,</a>
<a id='line_4162'>  But rested in her fealty, till he crowned</a>
<a id='line_4163'>  A happy life with a fair death, and fell</a>
<a id='line_4164'>  Against the heathen of the Northern Sea</a>
<a id='line_4165'>  In battle, fighting for the blameless King.</a>
<a id='line_4166'></a>
<a id='line_4167'></a>
<a id='line_4168'></a>
<a id='line_4169'>  Balin and Balan</a>
<a id='line_4170'></a>
<a id='line_4171'>  Pellam the King, who held and lost with Lot</a>
<a id='line_4172'>  In that first war, and had his realm restored</a>
<a id='line_4173'>  But rendered tributary, failed of late</a>
<a id='line_4174'>  To send his tribute; wherefore Arthur called</a>
<a id='line_4175'>  His treasurer, one of many years, and spake,</a>
<a id='line_4176'>  'Go thou with him and him and bring it to us,</a>
<a id='line_4177'>  Lest we should set one truer on his throne.</a>
<a id='line_4178'>  Man's word is God in man.'</a>
<a id='line_4179'>                            His Baron said</a>
<a id='line_4180'>  'We go but harken:  there be two strange knights</a>
<a id='line_4181'>  Who sit near Camelot at a fountain-side,</a>
<a id='line_4182'>  A mile beneath the forest, challenging</a>
<a id='line_4183'>  And overthrowing every knight who comes.</a>
<a id='line_4184'>  Wilt thou I undertake them as we pass,</a>
<a id='line_4185'>  And send them to thee?'</a>
<a id='line_4186'>                         Arthur laughed upon him.</a>
<a id='line_4187'>  'Old friend, too old to be so young, depart,</a>
<a id='line_4188'>  Delay not thou for aught, but let them sit,</a>
<a id='line_4189'>  Until they find a lustier than themselves.'</a>
<a id='line_4190'></a>
<a id='line_4191'>     So these departed.  Early, one fair dawn,</a>
<a id='line_4192'>  The light-winged spirit of his youth returned</a>
<a id='line_4193'>  On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went,</a>
<a id='line_4194'>  So coming to the fountain-side beheld</a>
<a id='line_4195'>  Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,</a>
<a id='line_4196'>  Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,</a>
<a id='line_4197'>  From underneath a plume of lady-fern,</a>
<a id='line_4198'>  Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.</a>
<a id='line_4199'>  And on the right of Balin Balin's horse</a>
<a id='line_4200'>  Was fast beside an alder, on the left</a>
<a id='line_4201'>  Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree.</a>
<a id='line_4202'>  'Fair Sirs,' said Arthur, 'wherefore sit ye here?'</a>
<a id='line_4203'>  Balin and Balan answered 'For the sake</a>
<a id='line_4204'>  Of glory; we be mightier men than all</a>
<a id='line_4205'>  In Arthur's court; that also have we proved;</a>
<a id='line_4206'>  For whatsoever knight against us came</a>
<a id='line_4207'>  Or I or he have easily overthrown.'</a>
<a id='line_4208'>  'I too,' said Arthur, 'am of Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_4209'>  But rather proven in his Paynim wars</a>
<a id='line_4210'>  Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,</a>
<a id='line_4211'>  Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.'</a>
<a id='line_4212'>  And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,</a>
<a id='line_4213'>  And lightly so returned, and no man knew.</a>
<a id='line_4214'></a>
<a id='line_4215'>     Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside</a>
<a id='line_4216'>  The carolling water set themselves again,</a>
<a id='line_4217'>  And spake no word until the shadow turned;</a>
<a id='line_4218'>  When from the fringe of coppice round them burst</a>
<a id='line_4219'>  A spangled pursuivant, and crying 'Sirs,</a>
<a id='line_4220'>  Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,'</a>
<a id='line_4221'>  They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked</a>
<a id='line_4222'>  'Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?'</a>
<a id='line_4223'>  Balin the stillness of a minute broke</a>
<a id='line_4224'>  Saying 'An unmelodious name to thee,</a>
<a id='line_4225'>  Balin, "the Savage"--that addition thine--</a>
<a id='line_4226'>  My brother and my better, this man here,</a>
<a id='line_4227'>  Balan.  I smote upon the naked skull</a>
<a id='line_4228'>  A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand</a>
<a id='line_4229'>  Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard</a>
<a id='line_4230'>  He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath</a>
<a id='line_4231'>  Sent me a three-years' exile from thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4232'>  I have not lived my life delightsomely:</a>
<a id='line_4233'>  For I that did that violence to thy thrall,</a>
<a id='line_4234'>  Had often wrought some fury on myself,</a>
<a id='line_4235'>  Saving for Balan:  those three kingless years</a>
<a id='line_4236'>  Have past--were wormwood-bitter to me.  King,</a>
<a id='line_4237'>  Methought that if we sat beside the well,</a>
<a id='line_4238'>  And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred</a>
<a id='line_4239'>  Against us, thou would'st take me gladlier back,</a>
<a id='line_4240'>  And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine</a>
<a id='line_4241'>  Than twenty Balins, Balan knight.  I have said.</a>
<a id='line_4242'>  Not so--not all.  A man of thine today</a>
<a id='line_4243'>  Abashed us both, and brake my boast.  Thy will?'</a>
<a id='line_4244'>  Said Arthur 'Thou hast ever spoken truth;</a>
<a id='line_4245'>  Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.</a>
<a id='line_4246'>  Rise, my true knight.  As children learn, be thou</a>
<a id='line_4247'>  Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move</a>
<a id='line_4248'>  To music with thine Order and the King.</a>
<a id='line_4249'>  Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands</a>
<a id='line_4250'>  Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!'</a>
<a id='line_4251'></a>
<a id='line_4252'>     Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,</a>
<a id='line_4253'>  The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven</a>
<a id='line_4254'>  With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth</a>
<a id='line_4255'>  Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,</a>
<a id='line_4256'>  Along the walls and down the board; they sat,</a>
<a id='line_4257'>  And cup clashed cup; they drank and some one sang,</a>
<a id='line_4258'>  Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon</a>
<a id='line_4259'>  Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made</a>
<a id='line_4260'>  Those banners of twelve battles overhead</a>
<a id='line_4261'>  Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur's host</a>
<a id='line_4262'>  Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.</a>
<a id='line_4263'></a>
<a id='line_4264'>     Then Balan added to their Order lived</a>
<a id='line_4265'>  A wealthier life than heretofore with these</a>
<a id='line_4266'>  And Balin, till their embassage returned.</a>
<a id='line_4267'></a>
<a id='line_4268'>     'Sir King' they brought report 'we hardly found,</a>
<a id='line_4269'>  So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall</a>
<a id='line_4270'>  Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once</a>
<a id='line_4271'>  A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed</a>
<a id='line_4272'>  Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm</a>
<a id='line_4273'>  Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King</a>
<a id='line_4274'>  Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;</a>
<a id='line_4275'>  And finds himself descended from the Saint</a>
<a id='line_4276'>  Arimathaean Joseph; him who first</a>
<a id='line_4277'>  Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;</a>
<a id='line_4278'>  He boasts his life as purer than thine own;</a>
<a id='line_4279'>  Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;</a>
<a id='line_4280'>  Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets</a>
<a id='line_4281'>  Or dame or damsel enter at his gates</a>
<a id='line_4282'>  Lest he should be polluted.  This gray King</a>
<a id='line_4283'>  Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders--yea--</a>
<a id='line_4284'>  Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,</a>
<a id='line_4285'>  Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,</a>
<a id='line_4286'>  And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought</a>
<a id='line_4287'>  By holy Joseph thither, that same spear</a>
<a id='line_4288'>  Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_4289'>  He much amazed us; after, when we sought</a>
<a id='line_4290'>  The tribute, answered "I have quite foregone</a>
<a id='line_4291'>  All matters of this world:  Garlon, mine heir,</a>
<a id='line_4292'>  Of him demand it," which this Garlon gave</a>
<a id='line_4293'>  With much ado, railing at thine and thee.</a>
<a id='line_4294'></a>
<a id='line_4295'>     'But when we left, in those deep woods we found</a>
<a id='line_4296'>  A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,</a>
<a id='line_4297'>  Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us</a>
<a id='line_4298'>  Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there</a>
<a id='line_4299'>  Reported of some demon in the woods</a>
<a id='line_4300'>  Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues</a>
<a id='line_4301'>  From all his fellows, lived alone, and came</a>
<a id='line_4302'>  To learn black magic, and to hate his kind</a>
<a id='line_4303'>  With such a hate, that when he died, his soul</a>
<a id='line_4304'>  Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life</a>
<a id='line_4305'>  Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,</a>
<a id='line_4306'>  Strikes from behind.  This woodman showed the cave</a>
<a id='line_4307'>  From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_4308'>  We saw the hoof-print of a horse, no more.'</a>
<a id='line_4309'></a>
<a id='line_4310'>     Then Arthur, 'Let who goes before me, see</a>
<a id='line_4311'>  He do not fall behind me:  foully slain</a>
<a id='line_4312'>  And villainously! who will hunt for me</a>
<a id='line_4313'>  This demon of the woods?'  Said Balan, 'I'!</a>
<a id='line_4314'>  So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,</a>
<a id='line_4315'>  Embracing Balin, 'Good my brother, hear!</a>
<a id='line_4316'>  Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone</a>
<a id='line_4317'>  Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,</a>
<a id='line_4318'>  Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,</a>
<a id='line_4319'>  Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream</a>
<a id='line_4320'>  That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.</a>
<a id='line_4321'>  Witness their flowery welcome.  Bound are they</a>
<a id='line_4322'>  To speak no evil.  Truly save for fears,</a>
<a id='line_4323'>  My fears for thee, so rich a fellowship</a>
<a id='line_4324'>  Would make me wholly blest:  thou one of them,</a>
<a id='line_4325'>  Be one indeed:  consider them, and all</a>
<a id='line_4326'>  Their bearing in their common bond of love,</a>
<a id='line_4327'>  No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,</a>
<a id='line_4328'>  No more of jealousy than in Paradise.'</a>
<a id='line_4329'></a>
<a id='line_4330'>     So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:</a>
<a id='line_4331'>  Who--for but three brief moons had glanced away</a>
<a id='line_4332'>  From being knighted till he smote the thrall,</a>
<a id='line_4333'>  And faded from the presence into years</a>
<a id='line_4334'>  Of exile--now would strictlier set himself</a>
<a id='line_4335'>  To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_4336'>  Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round</a>
<a id='line_4337'>  Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile</a>
<a id='line_4338'>  In passing, and a transitory word</a>
<a id='line_4339'>  Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem</a>
<a id='line_4340'>  From being smiled at happier in themselves--</a>
<a id='line_4341'>  Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,</a>
<a id='line_4342'>  That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak</a>
<a id='line_4343'>  Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;</a>
<a id='line_4344'>  For one from out his village lately climed</a>
<a id='line_4345'>  And brought report of azure lands and fair,</a>
<a id='line_4346'>  Far seen to left and right; and he himself</a>
<a id='line_4347'>  Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet</a>
<a id='line_4348'>  Up from the base:  so Balin marvelling oft</a>
<a id='line_4349'>  How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,</a>
<a id='line_4350'>  Groaned, and at times would mutter, 'These be gifts,</a>
<a id='line_4351'>  Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,</a>
<a id='line_4352'>  Beyond my reach.  Well had I foughten--well--</a>
<a id='line_4353'>  In those fierce wars, struck hard--and had I crowned</a>
<a id='line_4354'>  With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew--</a>
<a id='line_4355'>  So--better!--But this worship of the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_4356'>  That honour too wherein she holds him--this,</a>
<a id='line_4357'>  This was the sunshine that hath given the man</a>
<a id='line_4358'>  A growth, a name that branches o'er the rest,</a>
<a id='line_4359'>  And strength against all odds, and what the King</a>
<a id='line_4360'>  So prizes--overprizes--gentleness.</a>
<a id='line_4361'>  Her likewise would I worship an I might.</a>
<a id='line_4362'>  I never can be close with her, as he</a>
<a id='line_4363'>  That brought her hither.  Shall I pray the King</a>
<a id='line_4364'>  To let me bear some token of his Queen</a>
<a id='line_4365'>  Whereon to gaze, remembering her--forget</a>
<a id='line_4366'>  My heats and violences? live afresh?</a>
<a id='line_4367'>  What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay</a>
<a id='line_4368'>  Being so stately-gentle, would she make</a>
<a id='line_4369'>  My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace</a>
<a id='line_4370'>  She greeted my return!  Bold will I be--</a>
<a id='line_4371'>  Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_4372'>  In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,</a>
<a id='line_4373'>  Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery.'</a>
<a id='line_4374'></a>
<a id='line_4375'>     And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said</a>
<a id='line_4376'>  'What wilt thou bear?' Balin was bold, and asked</a>
<a id='line_4377'>  To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,</a>
<a id='line_4378'>  Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,</a>
<a id='line_4379'>  Who answered 'Thou shalt put the crown to use.</a>
<a id='line_4380'>  The crown is but the shadow of the King,</a>
<a id='line_4381'>  And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it,</a>
<a id='line_4382'>  So this will help him of his violences!'</a>
<a id='line_4383'>  'No shadow' said Sir Balin 'O my Queen,</a>
<a id='line_4384'>  But light to me! no shadow, O my King,</a>
<a id='line_4385'>  But golden earnest of a gentler life!'</a>
<a id='line_4386'></a>
<a id='line_4387'>     So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights</a>
<a id='line_4388'>  Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world</a>
<a id='line_4389'>  Made music, and he felt his being move</a>
<a id='line_4390'>  In music with his Order, and the King.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>     The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,</a>
<a id='line_4393'>  Hath ever and anon a note so thin</a>
<a id='line_4394'>  It seems another voice in other groves;</a>
<a id='line_4395'>  Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,</a>
<a id='line_4396'>  The music in him seemed to change, and grow</a>
<a id='line_4397'>  Faint and far-off.</a>
<a id='line_4398'>                    And once he saw the thrall</a>
<a id='line_4399'>  His passion half had gauntleted to death,</a>
<a id='line_4400'>  That causer of his banishment and shame,</a>
<a id='line_4401'>  Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:</a>
<a id='line_4402'>  His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:</a>
<a id='line_4403'>  The memory of that cognizance on shield</a>
<a id='line_4404'>  Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:</a>
<a id='line_4405'></a>
<a id='line_4406'>     'Too high this mount of Camelot for me:</a>
<a id='line_4407'>  These high-set courtesies are not for me.</a>
<a id='line_4408'>  Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?</a>
<a id='line_4409'>  Fierier and stormier from restraining, break</a>
<a id='line_4410'>  Into some madness even before the Queen?'</a>
<a id='line_4411'></a>
<a id='line_4412'>     Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,</a>
<a id='line_4413'>  And glancing on the window, when the gloom</a>
<a id='line_4414'>  Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame</a>
<a id='line_4415'>  That rages in the woodland far below,</a>
<a id='line_4416'>  So when his moods were darkened, court and King</a>
<a id='line_4417'>  And all the kindly warmth of Arthur's hall</a>
<a id='line_4418'>  Shadowed an angry distance:  yet he strove</a>
<a id='line_4419'>  To learn the graces of their Table, fought</a>
<a id='line_4420'>  Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.</a>
<a id='line_4421'></a>
<a id='line_4422'>     Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat</a>
<a id='line_4423'>  Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.</a>
<a id='line_4424'>  A walk of roses ran from door to door;</a>
<a id='line_4425'>  A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:</a>
<a id='line_4426'>  And down that range of roses the great Queen</a>
<a id='line_4427'>  Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;</a>
<a id='line_4428'>  And all in shadow from the counter door</a>
<a id='line_4429'>  Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,</a>
<a id='line_4430'>  As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced</a>
<a id='line_4431'>  The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.</a>
<a id='line_4432'>  Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her 'Prince,</a>
<a id='line_4433'>  Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,</a>
<a id='line_4434'>  As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?'</a>
<a id='line_4435'>  To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,</a>
<a id='line_4436'>  'Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_4437'>  'Yea so' she said 'but so to pass me by--</a>
<a id='line_4438'>  So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,</a>
<a id='line_4439'>  Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_4440'>  Let be:  ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream.'</a>
<a id='line_4441'></a>
<a id='line_4442'>     Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers</a>
<a id='line_4443'>  'Yea--for a dream.  Last night methought I saw</a>
<a id='line_4444'>  That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand</a>
<a id='line_4445'>  In yonder shrine.  All round her prest the dark,</a>
<a id='line_4446'>  And all the light upon her silver face</a>
<a id='line_4447'>  Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.</a>
<a id='line_4448'>  Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes--away:</a>
<a id='line_4449'>  For see, how perfect-pure!  As light a flush</a>
<a id='line_4450'>  As hardly tints the blossom of the quince</a>
<a id='line_4451'>  Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.'</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>     'Sweeter to me' she said 'this garden rose</a>
<a id='line_4454'>  Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still</a>
<a id='line_4455'>  The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.</a>
<a id='line_4456'>  Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers</a>
<a id='line_4457'>  In those fair days--not all as cool as these,</a>
<a id='line_4458'>  Though season-earlier.  Art thou sad? or sick?</a>
<a id='line_4459'>  Our noble King will send thee his own leech--</a>
<a id='line_4460'>  Sick? or for any matter angered at me?'</a>
<a id='line_4461'></a>
<a id='line_4462'>     Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt</a>
<a id='line_4463'>  Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall:  her hue</a>
<a id='line_4464'>  Changed at his gaze:  so turning side by side</a>
<a id='line_4465'>  They past, and Balin started from his bower.</a>
<a id='line_4466'></a>
<a id='line_4467'>     'Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.</a>
<a id='line_4468'>  Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.</a>
<a id='line_4469'>  My father hath begotten me in his wrath.</a>
<a id='line_4470'>  I suffer from the things before me, know,</a>
<a id='line_4471'>  Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;</a>
<a id='line_4472'>  A churl, a clown!' and in him gloom on gloom</a>
<a id='line_4473'>  Deepened:  he sharply caught his lance and shield,</a>
<a id='line_4474'>  Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>  But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.</a>
<a id='line_4476'></a>
<a id='line_4477'>     He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw</a>
<a id='line_4478'>  The fountain where they sat together, sighed</a>
<a id='line_4479'>  'Was I not better there with him?' and rode</a>
<a id='line_4480'>  The skyless woods, but under open blue</a>
<a id='line_4481'>  Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough</a>
<a id='line_4482'>  Wearily hewing.  'Churl, thine axe!' he cried,</a>
<a id='line_4483'>  Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:</a>
<a id='line_4484'>  To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly</a>
<a id='line_4485'>  'Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods</a>
<a id='line_4486'>  If arm of flesh could lay him.'  Balin cried</a>
<a id='line_4487'>  'Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,</a>
<a id='line_4488'>  To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me.'</a>
<a id='line_4489'>  'Nay' said the churl, 'our devil is a truth,</a>
<a id='line_4490'>  I saw the flash of him but yestereven.</a>
<a id='line_4491'>  And some do say that our Sir Garlon too</a>
<a id='line_4492'>  Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.</a>
<a id='line_4493'>  Look to the cave.'  But Balin answered him</a>
<a id='line_4494'>  'Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,</a>
<a id='line_4495'>  Look to thy woodcraft,' and so leaving him,</a>
<a id='line_4496'>  Now with slack rein and careless of himself,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>  Now with dug spur and raving at himself,</a>
<a id='line_4498'>  Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;</a>
<a id='line_4499'>  So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm</a>
<a id='line_4500'>  Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,</a>
<a id='line_4501'>  The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks</a>
<a id='line_4502'>  Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,</a>
<a id='line_4503'>  Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night</a>
<a id='line_4504'>  Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.</a>
<a id='line_4505'>  He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all</a>
<a id='line_4506'>  Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,</a>
<a id='line_4507'>  Past eastward from the falling sun.  At once</a>
<a id='line_4508'>  He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud</a>
<a id='line_4509'>  And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>  Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4511'>  Sideways he started from the path, and saw,</a>
<a id='line_4512'>  With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,</a>
<a id='line_4513'>  A light of armour by him flash, and pass</a>
<a id='line_4514'>  And vanish in the woods; and followed this,</a>
<a id='line_4515'>  But all so blind in rage that unawares</a>
<a id='line_4516'>  He burst his lance against a forest bough,</a>
<a id='line_4517'>  Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled</a>
<a id='line_4518'>  Far, till the castle of a King, the hall</a>
<a id='line_4519'>  Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped</a>
<a id='line_4520'>  With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;</a>
<a id='line_4521'>  The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>  The battlement overtopt with ivytods,</a>
<a id='line_4523'>  A home of bats, in every tower an owl.</a>
<a id='line_4524'>     Then spake the men of Pellam crying 'Lord,</a>
<a id='line_4525'>  Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?'</a>
<a id='line_4526'>  Said Balin 'For the fairest and the best</a>
<a id='line_4527'>  Of ladies living gave me this to bear.'</a>
<a id='line_4528'>  So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,</a>
<a id='line_4529'>  But found the greetings both of knight and King</a>
<a id='line_4530'>  Faint in the low dark hall of banquet:  leaves</a>
<a id='line_4531'>  Laid their green faces flat against the panes,</a>
<a id='line_4532'>  Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without</a>
<a id='line_4533'>  Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,</a>
<a id='line_4534'>  Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked</a>
<a id='line_4535'>  'Why wear ye that crown-royal?' Balin said</a>
<a id='line_4536'>  'The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,</a>
<a id='line_4537'>  As fairest, best and purest, granted me</a>
<a id='line_4538'>  To bear it!'  Such a sound (for Arthur's knights</a>
<a id='line_4539'>  Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes</a>
<a id='line_4540'>  The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears</a>
<a id='line_4541'>  A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,</a>
<a id='line_4542'>  Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.</a>
<a id='line_4543'>  'Fairest I grant her:  I have seen; but best,</a>
<a id='line_4544'>  Best, purest? thou from Arthur's hall, and yet</a>
<a id='line_4545'>  So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these</a>
<a id='line_4546'>  So far besotted that they fail to see</a>
<a id='line_4547'>  This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?</a>
<a id='line_4548'>  Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes.'</a>
<a id='line_4549'></a>
<a id='line_4550'>     A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed</a>
<a id='line_4551'>  With holy Joseph's legend, on his right</a>
<a id='line_4552'>  Stood, all of massiest bronze:  one side had sea</a>
<a id='line_4553'>  And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:</a>
<a id='line_4554'>  And one was rough with wattling, and the walls</a>
<a id='line_4555'>  Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.</a>
<a id='line_4556'>  This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,</a>
<a id='line_4557'>  Through memory of that token on the shield</a>
<a id='line_4558'>  Relaxed his hold:  'I will be gentle' he thought</a>
<a id='line_4559'>  'And passing gentle' caught his hand away,</a>
<a id='line_4560'>  Then fiercely to Sir Garlon 'Eyes have I</a>
<a id='line_4561'>  That saw today the shadow of a spear,</a>
<a id='line_4562'>  Shot from behind me, run along the ground;</a>
<a id='line_4563'>  Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws</a>
<a id='line_4564'>  From homage to the best and purest, might,</a>
<a id='line_4565'>  Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,</a>
<a id='line_4566'>  Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure</a>
<a id='line_4567'>  To mouth so huge a foulness--to thy guest,</a>
<a id='line_4568'>  Me, me of Arthur's Table.  Felon talk!</a>
<a id='line_4569'>  Let be! no more!'</a>
<a id='line_4570'>                   But not the less by night</a>
<a id='line_4571'>  The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,</a>
<a id='line_4572'>  Stung him in dreams.  At length, and dim through leaves</a>
<a id='line_4573'>  Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs</a>
<a id='line_4574'>  Whined in the wood.  He rose, descended, met</a>
<a id='line_4575'>  The scorner in the castle court, and fain,</a>
<a id='line_4576'>  For hate and loathing, would have past him by;</a>
<a id='line_4577'>  But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;</a>
<a id='line_4578'>  'What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?'</a>
<a id='line_4579'>  His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins</a>
<a id='line_4580'>  Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath</a>
<a id='line_4581'>  The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery 'Ha!</a>
<a id='line_4582'>  So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,'</a>
<a id='line_4583'>  Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew</a>
<a id='line_4584'>  Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.</a>
<a id='line_4585'>  Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,</a>
<a id='line_4586'>  And Balin by the banneret of his helm</a>
<a id='line_4587'>  Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry</a>
<a id='line_4588'>  Sounded across the court, and--men-at-arms,</a>
<a id='line_4589'>  A score with pointed lances, making at him--</a>
<a id='line_4590'>  He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,</a>
<a id='line_4591'>  Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet</a>
<a id='line_4592'>  Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked</a>
<a id='line_4593'>  The portal of King Pellam's chapel wide</a>
<a id='line_4594'>  And inward to the wall; he stept behind;</a>
<a id='line_4595'>  Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves</a>
<a id='line_4596'>  Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,</a>
<a id='line_4597'>  In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,</a>
<a id='line_4598'>  Beheld before a golden altar lie</a>
<a id='line_4599'>  The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,</a>
<a id='line_4600'>  Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon</a>
<a id='line_4601'>  Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,</a>
<a id='line_4602'>  Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;</a>
<a id='line_4603'>  Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side</a>
<a id='line_4604'>  The blindfold rummage buried in the walls</a>
<a id='line_4605'>  Might echo, ran the counter path, and found</a>
<a id='line_4606'>  His charger, mounted on him and away.</a>
<a id='line_4607'>  An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,</a>
<a id='line_4608'>  One overhead; and Pellam's feeble cry</a>
<a id='line_4609'>  'Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things</a>
<a id='line_4610'>  With earthly uses'--made him quickly dive</a>
<a id='line_4611'>  Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile</a>
<a id='line_4612'>  Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,</a>
<a id='line_4613'>  Arising wearily at a fallen oak,</a>
<a id='line_4614'>  Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.</a>
<a id='line_4615'></a>
<a id='line_4616'>     Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,</a>
<a id='line_4617'>  Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,</a>
<a id='line_4618'>  Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,</a>
<a id='line_4619'>  Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought</a>
<a id='line_4620'>  'I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,</a>
<a id='line_4621'>  Thee will I bear no more,' high on a branch</a>
<a id='line_4622'>  Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,</a>
<a id='line_4623'>  And there in gloom cast himself all along,</a>
<a id='line_4624'>  Moaning 'My violences, my violences!'</a>
<a id='line_4625'></a>
<a id='line_4626'>     But now the wholesome music of the wood</a>
<a id='line_4627'>  Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,</a>
<a id='line_4628'>  A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode</a>
<a id='line_4629'>  The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.</a>
<a id='line_4630'></a>
<a id='line_4631'>     'The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,</a>
<a id='line_4632'>  And kindled all the plain and all the wold.</a>
<a id='line_4633'>  The new leaf ever pushes off the old.</a>
<a id='line_4634'>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.</a>
<a id='line_4635'></a>
<a id='line_4636'>     'Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire--</a>
<a id='line_4637'>  Old monk and nun, ye scorn the world's desire,</a>
<a id='line_4638'>  Yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire!</a>
<a id='line_4639'>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.</a>
<a id='line_4640'></a>
<a id='line_4641'>     'The fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways.</a>
<a id='line_4642'>  The wayside blossoms open to the blaze.</a>
<a id='line_4643'>  The whole wood-world is one full peal of praise.</a>
<a id='line_4644'>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.</a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>
<a id='line_4646'>     'The fire of Heaven is lord of all things good,</a>
<a id='line_4647'>  And starve not thou this fire within thy blood,</a>
<a id='line_4648'>  But follow Vivien through the fiery flood!</a>
<a id='line_4649'>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell!'</a>
<a id='line_4650'></a>
<a id='line_4651'>     Then turning to her Squire 'This fire of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4652'>  This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,</a>
<a id='line_4653'>  And beat the cross to earth, and break the King</a>
<a id='line_4654'>  And all his Table.'</a>
<a id='line_4655'>                     Then they reached a glade,</a>
<a id='line_4656'>  Where under one long lane of cloudless air</a>
<a id='line_4657'>  Before another wood, the royal crown</a>
<a id='line_4658'>  Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm</a>
<a id='line_4659'>  Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;</a>
<a id='line_4660'>  Amazed were these; 'Lo there' she cried--'a crown--</a>
<a id='line_4661'>  Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_4662'>  And there a horse! the rider? where is he?</a>
<a id='line_4663'>  See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.</a>
<a id='line_4664'>  Not dead; he stirs!--but sleeping.  I will speak.</a>
<a id='line_4665'>  Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,</a>
<a id='line_4666'>  Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.</a>
<a id='line_4667'>  But bounden art thou, if from Arthur's hall,</a>
<a id='line_4668'>  To help the weak.  Behold, I fly from shame,</a>
<a id='line_4669'>  A lustful King, who sought to win my love</a>
<a id='line_4670'>  Through evil ways:  the knight, with whom I rode,</a>
<a id='line_4671'>  Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire</a>
<a id='line_4672'>  Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,</a>
<a id='line_4673'>  Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,</a>
<a id='line_4674'>  Arthur the blameless, pure as any maid,</a>
<a id='line_4675'>  To get me shelter for my maidenhood.</a>
<a id='line_4676'>  I charge thee by that crown upon thy shield,</a>
<a id='line_4677'>  And by the great Queen's name, arise and hence.'</a>
<a id='line_4678'></a>
<a id='line_4679'>     And Balin rose, 'Thither no more! nor Prince</a>
<a id='line_4680'>  Nor knight am I, but one that hath defamed</a>
<a id='line_4681'>  The cognizance she gave me:  here I dwell</a>
<a id='line_4682'>  Savage among the savage woods, here die--</a>
<a id='line_4683'>  Die:  let the wolves' black maws ensepulchre</a>
<a id='line_4684'>  Their brother beast, whose anger was his lord.</a>
<a id='line_4685'>  O me, that such a name as Guinevere's,</a>
<a id='line_4686'>  Which our high Lancelot hath so lifted up,</a>
<a id='line_4687'>  And been thereby uplifted, should through me,</a>
<a id='line_4688'>  My violence, and my villainy, come to shame.'</a>
<a id='line_4689'></a>
<a id='line_4690'>     Thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill, anon</a>
<a id='line_4691'>  Sighed all as suddenly.  Said Balin to her</a>
<a id='line_4692'>  'Is this thy courtesy--to mock me, ha?</a>
<a id='line_4693'>  Hence, for I will not with thee.'  Again she sighed</a>
<a id='line_4694'>  'Pardon, sweet lord! we maidens often laugh</a>
<a id='line_4695'>  When sick at heart, when rather we should weep.</a>
<a id='line_4696'>  I knew thee wronged.  I brake upon thy rest,</a>
<a id='line_4697'>  And now full loth am I to break thy dream,</a>
<a id='line_4698'>  But thou art man, and canst abide a truth,</a>
<a id='line_4699'>  Though bitter.  Hither, boy--and mark me well.</a>
<a id='line_4700'>  Dost thou remember at Caerleon once--</a>
<a id='line_4701'>  A year ago--nay, then I love thee not--</a>
<a id='line_4702'>  Ay, thou rememberest well--one summer dawn--</a>
<a id='line_4703'>  By the great tower--Caerleon upon Usk--</a>
<a id='line_4704'>  Nay, truly we were hidden:  this fair lord,</a>
<a id='line_4705'>  The flower of all their vestal knighthood, knelt</a>
<a id='line_4706'>  In amorous homage--knelt--what else?--O ay</a>
<a id='line_4707'>  Knelt, and drew down from out his night-black hair</a>
<a id='line_4708'>  And mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress</a>
<a id='line_4709'>  Had wandered from her own King's golden head,</a>
<a id='line_4710'>  And lost itself in darkness, till she cried--</a>
<a id='line_4711'>  I thought the great tower would crash down on both--</a>
<a id='line_4712'>  "Rise, my sweet King, and kiss me on the lips,</a>
<a id='line_4713'>  Thou art my King."  This lad, whose lightest word</a>
<a id='line_4714'>  Is mere white truth in simple nakedness,</a>
<a id='line_4715'>  Saw them embrace:  he reddens, cannot speak,</a>
<a id='line_4716'>  So bashful, he! but all the maiden Saints,</a>
<a id='line_4717'>  The deathless mother-maidenhood of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4718'>  Cry out upon her.  Up then, ride with me!</a>
<a id='line_4719'>  Talk not of shame! thou canst not, an thou would'st,</a>
<a id='line_4720'>  Do these more shame than these have done themselves.'</a>
<a id='line_4721'></a>
<a id='line_4722'>     She lied with ease; but horror-stricken he,</a>
<a id='line_4723'>  Remembering that dark bower at Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_4724'>  Breathed in a dismal whisper 'It is truth.'</a>
<a id='line_4725'></a>
<a id='line_4726'>     Sunnily she smiled 'And even in this lone wood,</a>
<a id='line_4727'>  Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.</a>
<a id='line_4728'>  Fools prate, and perish traitors.  Woods have tongues,</a>
<a id='line_4729'>  As walls have ears:  but thou shalt go with me,</a>
<a id='line_4730'>  And we will speak at first exceeding low.</a>
<a id='line_4731'>  Meet is it the good King be not deceived.</a>
<a id='line_4732'>  See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,</a>
<a id='line_4733'>  From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like</a>
<a id='line_4734'>  Stoop at thy will on Lancelot and the Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_4735'></a>
<a id='line_4736'>     She ceased; his evil spirit upon him leapt,</a>
<a id='line_4737'>  He ground his teeth together, sprang with a yell,</a>
<a id='line_4738'>  Tore from the branch, and cast on earth, the shield,</a>
<a id='line_4739'>  Drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown,</a>
<a id='line_4740'>  Stampt all into defacement, hurled it from him</a>
<a id='line_4741'>  Among the forest weeds, and cursed the tale,</a>
<a id='line_4742'>  The told-of, and the teller.</a>
<a id='line_4743'>                              That weird yell,</a>
<a id='line_4744'>  Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,</a>
<a id='line_4745'>  Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there</a>
<a id='line_4746'>  (His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought</a>
<a id='line_4747'>  'The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!'</a>
<a id='line_4748'>  Then nearing 'Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,</a>
<a id='line_4749'>  And tramples on the goodly shield to show</a>
<a id='line_4750'>  His loathing of our Order and the Queen.</a>
<a id='line_4751'>  My quest, meseems, is here.  Or devil or man</a>
<a id='line_4752'>  Guard thou thine head.'  Sir Balin spake not word,</a>
<a id='line_4753'>  But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,</a>
<a id='line_4754'>  And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed</a>
<a id='line_4755'>  In onset, and King Pellam's holy spear,</a>
<a id='line_4756'>  Reputed to be red with sinless blood,</a>
<a id='line_4757'>  Redded at once with sinful, for the point</a>
<a id='line_4758'>  Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked</a>
<a id='line_4759'>  The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin's horse</a>
<a id='line_4760'>  Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,</a>
<a id='line_4761'>  Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man</a>
<a id='line_4762'>  Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.</a>
<a id='line_4763'></a>
<a id='line_4764'>     Then to her Squire muttered the damsel 'Fools!</a>
<a id='line_4765'>  This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:</a>
<a id='line_4766'>  Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved</a>
<a id='line_4767'>  And thus foamed over at a rival name:</a>
<a id='line_4768'>  But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,</a>
<a id='line_4769'>  Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down--</a>
<a id='line_4770'>  Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk--</a>
<a id='line_4771'>  And yet hast often pleaded for my love--</a>
<a id='line_4772'>  See what I see, be thou where I have been,</a>
<a id='line_4773'>  Or else Sir Chick--dismount and loose their casques</a>
<a id='line_4774'>  I fain would know what manner of men they be.'</a>
<a id='line_4775'>  And when the Squire had loosed them, 'Goodly!--look!</a>
<a id='line_4776'>  They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,</a>
<a id='line_4777'>  And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,</a>
<a id='line_4778'>  Dead for one heifer!</a>
<a id='line_4779'>                      Then the gentle Squire</a>
<a id='line_4780'>  'I hold them happy, so they died for love:</a>
<a id='line_4781'>  And, Vivien, though ye beat me like your dog,</a>
<a id='line_4782'>  I too could die, as now I live, for thee.'</a>
<a id='line_4783'></a>
<a id='line_4784'>     'Live on, Sir Boy,' she cried.  'I better prize</a>
<a id='line_4785'>  The living dog than the dead lion:  away!</a>
<a id='line_4786'>  I cannot brook to gaze upon the dead.'</a>
<a id='line_4787'>  Then leapt her palfrey o'er the fallen oak,</a>
<a id='line_4788'>  And bounding forward 'Leave them to the wolves.'</a>
<a id='line_4789'></a>
<a id='line_4790'>     But when their foreheads felt the cooling air,</a>
<a id='line_4791'>  Balin first woke, and seeing that true face,</a>
<a id='line_4792'>  Familiar up from cradle-time, so wan,</a>
<a id='line_4793'>  Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,</a>
<a id='line_4794'>  And on his dying brother cast himself</a>
<a id='line_4795'>  Dying; and he lifted faint eyes; he felt</a>
<a id='line_4796'>  One near him; all at once they found the world,</a>
<a id='line_4797'>  Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail</a>
<a id='line_4798'>  And drawing down the dim disastrous brow</a>
<a id='line_4799'>  That o'er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;</a>
<a id='line_4800'></a>
<a id='line_4801'>     'O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died</a>
<a id='line_4802'>  To save thy life, have brought thee to thy death.</a>
<a id='line_4803'>  Why had ye not the shield I knew? and why</a>
<a id='line_4804'>  Trampled ye thus on that which bare the Crown?'</a>
<a id='line_4805'></a>
<a id='line_4806'>     Then Balin told him brokenly, and in gasps,</a>
<a id='line_4807'>  All that had chanced, and Balan moaned again.</a>
<a id='line_4808'></a>
<a id='line_4809'>     'Brother, I dwelt a day in Pellam's hall:</a>
<a id='line_4810'>  This Garlon mocked me, but I heeded not.</a>
<a id='line_4811'>  And one said "Eat in peace! a liar is he,</a>
<a id='line_4812'>  And hates thee for the tribute!" this good knight</a>
<a id='line_4813'>  Told me, that twice a wanton damsel came,</a>
<a id='line_4814'>  And sought for Garlon at the castle-gates,</a>
<a id='line_4815'>  Whom Pellam drove away with holy heat.</a>
<a id='line_4816'>  I well believe this damsel, and the one</a>
<a id='line_4817'>  Who stood beside thee even now, the same.</a>
<a id='line_4818'>  "She dwells among the woods" he said "and meets</a>
<a id='line_4819'>  And dallies with him in the Mouth of Hell."</a>
<a id='line_4820'>  Foul are their lives; foul are their lips; they lied.</a>
<a id='line_4821'>  Pure as our own true Mother is our Queen."</a>
<a id='line_4822'></a>
<a id='line_4823'>     'O brother' answered Balin 'woe is me!</a>
<a id='line_4824'>  My madness all thy life has been thy doom,</a>
<a id='line_4825'>  Thy curse, and darkened all thy day; and now</a>
<a id='line_4826'>  The night has come.  I scarce can see thee now.</a>
<a id='line_4827'></a>
<a id='line_4828'>  Goodnight! for we shall never bid again</a>
<a id='line_4829'>  Goodmorrow--Dark my doom was here, and dark</a>
<a id='line_4830'>  It will be there.  I see thee now no more.</a>
<a id='line_4831'>  I would not mine again should darken thine,</a>
<a id='line_4832'>  Goodnight, true brother.</a>
<a id='line_4833'>                          Balan answered low</a>
<a id='line_4834'>  'Goodnight, true brother here! goodmorrow there!</a>
<a id='line_4835'>  We two were born together, and we die</a>
<a id='line_4836'>  Together by one doom:' and while he spoke</a>
<a id='line_4837'>  Closed his death-drowsing eyes, and slept the sleep</a>
<a id='line_4838'>  With Balin, either locked in either's arm.</a>
<a id='line_4839'></a>
<a id='line_4840'></a>
<a id='line_4841'></a>
<a id='line_4842'>  Merlin and Vivien</a>
<a id='line_4843'></a>
<a id='line_4844'>  A storm was coming, but the winds were still,</a>
<a id='line_4845'>  And in the wild woods of Broceliande,</a>
<a id='line_4846'>  Before an oak, so hollow, huge and old</a>
<a id='line_4847'>  It looked a tower of ivied masonwork,</a>
<a id='line_4848'>  At Merlin's feet the wily Vivien lay.</a>
<a id='line_4849'></a>
<a id='line_4850'>     For he that always bare in bitter grudge</a>
<a id='line_4851'>  The slights of Arthur and his Table, Mark</a>
<a id='line_4852'>  The Cornish King, had heard a wandering voice,</a>
<a id='line_4853'>  A minstrel of Caerleon by strong storm</a>
<a id='line_4854'>  Blown into shelter at Tintagil, say</a>
<a id='line_4855'>  That out of naked knightlike purity</a>
<a id='line_4856'>  Sir Lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl</a>
<a id='line_4857'>  But the great Queen herself, fought in her name,</a>
<a id='line_4858'>  Sware by her--vows like theirs, that high in heaven</a>
<a id='line_4859'>  Love most, but neither marry, nor are given</a>
<a id='line_4860'>  In marriage, angels of our Lord's report.</a>
<a id='line_4861'></a>
<a id='line_4862'>     He ceased, and then--for Vivien sweetly said</a>
<a id='line_4863'>  (She sat beside the banquet nearest Mark),</a>
<a id='line_4864'>  'And is the fair example followed, Sir,</a>
<a id='line_4865'>  In Arthur's household?'--answered innocently:</a>
<a id='line_4866'></a>
<a id='line_4867'>     'Ay, by some few--ay, truly--youths that hold</a>
<a id='line_4868'>  It more beseems the perfect virgin knight</a>
<a id='line_4869'>  To worship woman as true wife beyond</a>
<a id='line_4870'>  All hopes of gaining, than as maiden girl.</a>
<a id='line_4871'>  They place their pride in Lancelot and the Queen.</a>
<a id='line_4872'>  So passionate for an utter purity</a>
<a id='line_4873'>  Beyond the limit of their bond, are these,</a>
<a id='line_4874'>  For Arthur bound them not to singleness.</a>
<a id='line_4875'>  Brave hearts and clean! and yet--God guide them--young.'</a>
<a id='line_4876'></a>
<a id='line_4877'>     Then Mark was half in heart to hurl his cup</a>
<a id='line_4878'>  Straight at the speaker, but forbore:  he rose</a>
<a id='line_4879'>  To leave the hall, and, Vivien following him,</a>
<a id='line_4880'>  Turned to her:  'Here are snakes within the grass;</a>
<a id='line_4881'>  And you methinks, O Vivien, save ye fear</a>
<a id='line_4882'>  The monkish manhood, and the mask of pure</a>
<a id='line_4883'>  Worn by this court, can stir them till they sting.'</a>
<a id='line_4884'></a>
<a id='line_4885'>     And Vivien answered, smiling scornfully,</a>
<a id='line_4886'>  'Why fear? because that fostered at thy court</a>
<a id='line_4887'>  I savour of thy--virtues? fear them? no.</a>
<a id='line_4888'>  As Love, if Love is perfect, casts out fear,</a>
<a id='line_4889'>  So Hate, if Hate is perfect, casts out fear.</a>
<a id='line_4890'>  My father died in battle against the King,</a>
<a id='line_4891'>  My mother on his corpse in open field;</a>
<a id='line_4892'>  She bore me there, for born from death was I</a>
<a id='line_4893'>  Among the dead and sown upon the wind--</a>
<a id='line_4894'>  And then on thee! and shown the truth betimes,</a>
<a id='line_4895'>  That old true filth, and bottom of the well</a>
<a id='line_4896'>  Where Truth is hidden.  Gracious lessons thine</a>
<a id='line_4897'>  And maxims of the mud!  "This Arthur pure!</a>
<a id='line_4898'>  Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made</a>
<a id='line_4899'>  Gives him the lie!  There is no being pure,</a>
<a id='line_4900'>  My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?"--</a>
<a id='line_4901'>  If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.</a>
<a id='line_4902'>  Thy blessing, stainless King!  I bring thee back,</a>
<a id='line_4903'>  When I have ferreted out their burrowings,</a>
<a id='line_4904'>  The hearts of all this Order in mine hand--</a>
<a id='line_4905'>  Ay--so that fate and craft and folly close,</a>
<a id='line_4906'>  Perchance, one curl of Arthur's golden beard.</a>
<a id='line_4907'>  To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine</a>
<a id='line_4908'>  Is cleaner-fashioned--Well, I loved thee first,</a>
<a id='line_4909'>  That warps the wit.'</a>
<a id='line_4910'></a>
<a id='line_4911'>                      Loud laughed the graceless Mark,</a>
<a id='line_4912'>  But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged</a>
<a id='line_4913'>  Low in the city, and on a festal day</a>
<a id='line_4914'>  When Guinevere was crossing the great hall</a>
<a id='line_4915'>  Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.</a>
<a id='line_4916'></a>
<a id='line_4917'>     'Why kneel ye there?  What evil hath ye wrought?</a>
<a id='line_4918'>  Rise!' and the damsel bidden rise arose</a>
<a id='line_4919'>  And stood with folded hands and downward eyes</a>
<a id='line_4920'>  Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,</a>
<a id='line_4921'>  'None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!</a>
<a id='line_4922'>  My father died in battle for thy King,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>  My mother on his corpse--in open field,</a>

<a id='line_4934'>  Among thy maidens!</a>
<a id='line_4935'></a>
<a id='line_4936'>                    Here her slow sweet eyes</a>
<a id='line_4937'>  Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose</a>
<a id='line_4938'>  Fixt on her hearer's, while the Queen who stood</a>
<a id='line_4939'>  All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves</a>
<a id='line_4940'>  In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,</a>
<a id='line_4941'>  'Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame</a>
<a id='line_4942'>  We choose the last.  Our noble Arthur, him</a>
<a id='line_4943'>  Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.</a>
<a id='line_4944'>  Nay--we believe all evil of thy Mark--</a>
<a id='line_4945'>  Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour</a>
<a id='line_4946'>  We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.</a>
<a id='line_4947'>  He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;</a>

<a id='line_4949'></a>
<a id='line_4950'>     She past; and Vivien murmured after 'Go!</a>
<a id='line_4951'>  I bide the while.'  Then through the portal-arch</a>
<a id='line_4952'>  Peering askance, and muttering broken-wise,</a>
<a id='line_4953'>  As one that labours with an evil dream,</a>
<a id='line_4954'>  Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.</a>
<a id='line_4955'></a>
<a id='line_4956'>     'Is that the Lancelot? goodly--ay, but gaunt:</a>
<a id='line_4957'>  Courteous--amends for gauntness--takes her hand--</a>
<a id='line_4958'>  That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been</a>
<a id='line_4959'>  A clinging kiss--how hand lingers in hand!</a>
<a id='line_4960'>  Let go at last!--they ride away--to hawk</a>
<a id='line_4961'>  For waterfowl.  Royaller game is mine.</a>
<a id='line_4962'>  For such a supersensual sensual bond</a>
<a id='line_4963'>  As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth--</a>
<a id='line_4964'>  Touch flax with flame--a glance will serve--the liars!</a>
<a id='line_4965'>  Ah little rat that borest in the dyke</a>
<a id='line_4966'>  Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep</a>
<a id='line_4967'>  Down upon far-off cities while they dance--</a>
<a id='line_4968'>  Or dream--of thee they dreamed not--nor of me</a>
<a id='line_4969'>  These--ay, but each of either:  ride, and dream</a>
<a id='line_4970'>  The mortal dream that never yet was mine--</a>
<a id='line_4971'>  Ride, ride and dream until ye wake--to me!</a>
<a id='line_4972'>  Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!</a>
<a id='line_4973'>  For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,</a>
<a id='line_4974'>  And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,</a>
<a id='line_4975'>  Will hate, loathe, fear--but honour me the more.'</a>
<a id='line_4976'></a>
<a id='line_4977'>     Yet while they rode together down the plain,</a>
<a id='line_4978'>  Their talk was all of training, terms of art,</a>
<a id='line_4979'>  Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.</a>
<a id='line_4980'>  'She is too noble' he said 'to check at pies,</a>
<a id='line_4981'>  Nor will she rake:  there is no baseness in her.'</a>
<a id='line_4982'>  Here when the Queen demanded as by chance</a>
<a id='line_4983'>  'Know ye the stranger woman?'  'Let her be,'</a>
<a id='line_4984'>  Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off</a>
<a id='line_4985'>  The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,</a>
<a id='line_4986'>  Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up</a>
<a id='line_4987'>  Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,</a>
<a id='line_4988'>  Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird</a>
<a id='line_4989'>  Who pounced her quarry and slew it.  Many a time</a>
<a id='line_4990'>  As once--of old--among the flowers--they rode.</a>
<a id='line_4991'></a>
<a id='line_4992'>     But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen</a>
<a id='line_4993'>  Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched</a>
<a id='line_4994'>  And whispered:  through the peaceful court she crept</a>
<a id='line_4995'>  And whispered:  then as Arthur in the highest</a>
<a id='line_4996'>  Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,</a>
<a id='line_4997'>  Arriving at a time of golden rest,</a>
<a id='line_4998'>  And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,</a>
<a id='line_4999'>  While all the heathen lay at Arthur's feet,</a>
<a id='line_5000'>  And no quest came, but all was joust and play,</a>
<a id='line_5001'>  Leavened his hall.  They heard and let her be.</a>
<a id='line_5002'></a>
<a id='line_5003'>     Thereafter as an enemy that has left</a>
<a id='line_5004'>  Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,</a>
<a id='line_5005'>  The wily Vivien stole from Arthur's court.</a>
<a id='line_5006'></a>
<a id='line_5007'>     She hated all the knights, and heard in thought</a>
<a id='line_5008'>  Their lavish comment when her name was named.</a>
<a id='line_5009'>  For once, when Arthur walking all alone,</a>
<a id='line_5010'>  Vext at a rumour issued from herself</a>
<a id='line_5011'>  Of some corruption crept among his knights,</a>
<a id='line_5012'>  Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,</a>
<a id='line_5013'>  Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood</a>
<a id='line_5014'>  With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,</a>
<a id='line_5015'>  And fluttered adoration, and at last</a>
<a id='line_5016'>  With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more</a>
<a id='line_5017'>  Than who should prize him most; at which the King</a>
<a id='line_5018'>  Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:</a>
<a id='line_5019'>  But one had watched, and had not held his peace:</a>
<a id='line_5020'>  It made the laughter of an afternoon</a>
<a id='line_5021'>  That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.</a>
<a id='line_5022'>  And after that, she set herself to gain</a>
<a id='line_5023'>  Him, the most famous man of all those times,</a>
<a id='line_5024'>  Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,</a>
<a id='line_5025'>  Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,</a>
<a id='line_5026'>  Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;</a>
<a id='line_5027'>  The people called him Wizard; whom at first</a>
<a id='line_5028'>  She played about with slight and sprightly talk,</a>
<a id='line_5029'>  And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points</a>
<a id='line_5030'>  Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;</a>
<a id='line_5031'>  And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer</a>
<a id='line_5032'>  Would watch her at her petulance, and play,</a>
<a id='line_5033'>  Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh</a>
<a id='line_5034'>  As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew</a>
<a id='line_5035'>  Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,</a>
<a id='line_5036'>  Perceiving that she was but half disdained,</a>
<a id='line_5037'>  Began to break her sports with graver fits,</a>
<a id='line_5038'>  Turn red or pale, would often when they met</a>
<a id='line_5039'>  Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him</a>
<a id='line_5040'>  With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,</a>
<a id='line_5041'>  Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times</a>
<a id='line_5042'>  Would flatter his own wish in age for love,</a>
<a id='line_5043'>  And half believe her true:  for thus at times</a>
<a id='line_5044'>  He wavered; but that other clung to him,</a>
<a id='line_5045'>  Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.</a>
<a id='line_5046'></a>
<a id='line_5047'>     Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;</a>
<a id='line_5048'>  He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found</a>
<a id='line_5049'>  A doom that ever poised itself to fall,</a>
<a id='line_5050'>  An ever-moaning battle in the mist,</a>
<a id='line_5051'>  World-war of dying flesh against the life,</a>
<a id='line_5052'>  Death in all life and lying in all love,</a>
<a id='line_5053'>  The meanest having power upon the highest,</a>
<a id='line_5054'>  And the high purpose broken by the worm.</a>
<a id='line_5055'></a>
<a id='line_5056'>     So leaving Arthur's court he gained the beach;</a>
<a id='line_5057'>  There found a little boat, and stept into it;</a>
<a id='line_5058'>  And Vivien followed, but he marked her not.</a>
<a id='line_5059'>  She took the helm and he the sail; the boat</a>
<a id='line_5060'>  Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,</a>
<a id='line_5061'>  And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.</a>
<a id='line_5062'>  And then she followed Merlin all the way,</a>
<a id='line_5063'>  Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.</a>
<a id='line_5064'>  For Merlin once had told her of a charm,</a>
<a id='line_5065'>  The which if any wrought on anyone</a>
<a id='line_5066'>  With woven paces and with waving arms,</a>
<a id='line_5067'>  The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie</a>
<a id='line_5068'>  Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,</a>
<a id='line_5069'>  From which was no escape for evermore;</a>
<a id='line_5070'>  And none could find that man for evermore,</a>
<a id='line_5071'>  Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm</a>
<a id='line_5072'>  Coming and going, and he lay as dead</a>
<a id='line_5073'>  And lost to life and use and name and fame.</a>
<a id='line_5074'>  And Vivien ever sought to work the charm</a>
<a id='line_5075'>  Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,</a>
<a id='line_5076'>  As fancying that her glory would be great</a>
<a id='line_5077'>  According to his greatness whom she quenched.</a>
<a id='line_5078'></a>
<a id='line_5079'>     There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,</a>
<a id='line_5080'>  As if in deepest reverence and in love.</a>
<a id='line_5081'>  A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe</a>
<a id='line_5082'>  Of samite without price, that more exprest</a>
<a id='line_5083'>  Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,</a>
<a id='line_5084'>  In colour like the satin-shining palm</a>
<a id='line_5085'>  On sallows in the windy gleams of March:</a>
<a id='line_5086'>  And while she kissed them, crying, 'Trample me,</a>
<a id='line_5087'>  Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,</a>
<a id='line_5088'>  And I will pay you worship; tread me down</a>
<a id='line_5089'>  And I will kiss you for it;' he was mute:</a>
<a id='line_5090'>  So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,</a>
<a id='line_5091'>  As on a dull day in an Ocean cave</a>
<a id='line_5092'>  The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall</a>
<a id='line_5093'>  In silence:  wherefore, when she lifted up</a>
<a id='line_5094'>  A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,</a>
<a id='line_5095'>  'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and again,</a>
<a id='line_5096'>  'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and once more,</a>
<a id='line_5097'>  'Great Master, do ye love me?' he was mute.</a>
<a id='line_5098'>  And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,</a>
<a id='line_5099'>  Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,</a>
<a id='line_5100'>  Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet</a>
<a id='line_5101'>  Together, curved an arm about his neck,</a>
<a id='line_5102'>  Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand</a>
<a id='line_5103'>  Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,</a>
<a id='line_5104'>  Made with her right a comb of pearl to part</a>
<a id='line_5105'>  The lists of such a board as youth gone out</a>
<a id='line_5106'>  Had left in ashes:  then he spoke and said,</a>
<a id='line_5107'>  Not looking at her, 'Who are wise in love</a>
<a id='line_5108'>  Love most, say least,' and Vivien answered quick,</a>
<a id='line_5109'>  'I saw the little elf-god eyeless once</a>
<a id='line_5110'>  In Arthur's arras hall at Camelot:</a>
<a id='line_5111'>  But neither eyes nor tongue--O stupid child!</a>
<a id='line_5112'>  Yet you are wise who say it; let me think</a>
<a id='line_5113'>  Silence is wisdom:  I am silent then,</a>
<a id='line_5114'>  And ask no kiss;' then adding all at once,</a>
<a id='line_5115'>  'And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom,' drew</a>
<a id='line_5116'>  The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard</a>
<a id='line_5117'>  Across her neck and bosom to her knee,</a>
<a id='line_5118'>  And called herself a gilded summer fly</a>
<a id='line_5119'>  Caught in a great old tyrant spider's web,</a>
<a id='line_5120'>  Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood</a>
<a id='line_5121'>  Without one word.  So Vivien called herself,</a>
<a id='line_5122'>  But rather seemed a lovely baleful star</a>
<a id='line_5123'>  Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:</a>
<a id='line_5124'>  'To what request for what strange boon,' he said,</a>
<a id='line_5125'>  'Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,</a>
<a id='line_5126'>  O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,</a>
<a id='line_5127'>  For these have broken up my melancholy.'</a>
<a id='line_5128'></a>
<a id='line_5129'>     And Vivien answered smiling saucily,</a>
<a id='line_5130'>  'What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?</a>
<a id='line_5131'>  I bid the stranger welcome.  Thanks at last!</a>
<a id='line_5132'>  But yesterday you never opened lip,</a>
<a id='line_5133'>  Except indeed to drink:  no cup had we:</a>
<a id='line_5134'>  In mine own lady palms I culled the spring</a>
<a id='line_5135'>  That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,</a>
<a id='line_5136'>  And made a pretty cup of both my hands</a>
<a id='line_5137'>  And offered you it kneeling:  then you drank</a>
<a id='line_5138'>  And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;</a>
<a id='line_5139'>  O no more thanks than might a goat have given</a>
<a id='line_5140'>  With no more sign of reverence than a beard.</a>
<a id='line_5141'>  And when we halted at that other well,</a>
<a id='line_5142'>  And I was faint to swooning, and you lay</a>
<a id='line_5143'>  Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those</a>
<a id='line_5144'>  Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know</a>
<a id='line_5145'>  That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?</a>
<a id='line_5146'>  And yet no thanks:  and all through this wild wood</a>
<a id='line_5147'>  And all this morning when I fondled you:</a>
<a id='line_5148'>  Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange--</a>
<a id='line_5149'>  How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,</a>
<a id='line_5150'>  But such a silence is more wise than kind.'</a>
<a id='line_5151'></a>
<a id='line_5152'>     And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:</a>
<a id='line_5153'>  'O did ye never lie upon the shore,</a>
<a id='line_5154'>  And watch the curled white of the coming wave</a>
<a id='line_5155'>  Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?</a>
<a id='line_5156'>  Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,</a>
<a id='line_5157'>  Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,</a>
<a id='line_5158'>  Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.</a>
<a id='line_5159'>  And then I rose and fled from Arthur's court</a>
<a id='line_5160'>  To break the mood.  You followed me unasked;</a>
<a id='line_5161'>  And when I looked, and saw you following me still,</a>
<a id='line_5162'>  My mind involved yourself the nearest thing</a>
<a id='line_5163'>  In that mind-mist:  for shall I tell you truth?</a>
<a id='line_5164'>  You seemed that wave about to break upon me</a>
<a id='line_5165'>  And sweep me from my hold upon the world,</a>
<a id='line_5166'>  My use and name and fame.  Your pardon, child.</a>
<a id='line_5167'>  Your pretty sports have brightened all again.</a>
<a id='line_5168'>  And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,</a>
<a id='line_5169'>  Once for wrong done you by confusion, next</a>
<a id='line_5170'>  For thanks it seems till now neglected, last</a>
<a id='line_5171'>  For these your dainty gambols:  wherefore ask;</a>
<a id='line_5172'>  And take this boon so strange and not so strange.'</a>
<a id='line_5173'></a>
<a id='line_5174'>     And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:</a>
<a id='line_5175'>  'O not so strange as my long asking it,</a>
<a id='line_5176'>  Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,</a>
<a id='line_5177'>  Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.</a>
<a id='line_5178'>  I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;</a>
<a id='line_5179'>  And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.</a>
<a id='line_5180'>  The people call you prophet:  let it be:</a>
<a id='line_5181'>  But not of those that can expound themselves.</a>
<a id='line_5182'>  Take Vivien for expounder; she will call</a>
<a id='line_5183'>  That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours</a>
<a id='line_5184'>  No presage, but the same mistrustful mood</a>
<a id='line_5185'>  That makes you seem less noble than yourself,</a>
<a id='line_5186'>  Whenever I have asked this very boon,</a>
<a id='line_5187'>  Now asked again:  for see you not, dear love,</a>
<a id='line_5188'>  That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed</a>
<a id='line_5189'>  Your fancy when ye saw me following you,</a>
<a id='line_5190'>  Must make me fear still more you are not mine,</a>
<a id='line_5191'>  Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,</a>
<a id='line_5192'>  And make me wish still more to learn this charm</a>
<a id='line_5193'>  Of woven paces and of waving hands,</a>
<a id='line_5194'>  As proof of trust.  O Merlin, teach it me.</a>
<a id='line_5195'>  The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.</a>
<a id='line_5196'>  For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,</a>
<a id='line_5197'>  I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,</a>
<a id='line_5198'>  Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.</a>
<a id='line_5199'>  And therefore be as great as ye are named,</a>
<a id='line_5200'>  Not muffled round with selfish reticence.</a>
<a id='line_5201'>  How hard you look and how denyingly!</a>
<a id='line_5202'>  O, if you think this wickedness in me,</a>
<a id='line_5203'>  That I should prove it on you unawares,</a>
<a id='line_5204'>  That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond</a>
<a id='line_5205'>  Had best be loosed for ever:  but think or not,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>  By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,</a>
<a id='line_5207'>  As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:</a>
<a id='line_5208'>  O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,</a>
<a id='line_5209'>  If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,</a>
<a id='line_5210'>  Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,</a>
<a id='line_5211'>  Have tript on such conjectural treachery--</a>
<a id='line_5212'>  May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell</a>
<a id='line_5213'>  Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,</a>
<a id='line_5214'>  If I be such a traitress.  Yield my boon,</a>
<a id='line_5215'>  Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;</a>
<a id='line_5216'>  And grant my re-reiterated wish,</a>
<a id='line_5217'>  The great proof of your love:  because I think,</a>
<a id='line_5218'>  However wise, ye hardly know me yet.'</a>
<a id='line_5219'></a>
<a id='line_5220'>     And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,</a>
<a id='line_5221'>  'I never was less wise, however wise,</a>
<a id='line_5222'>  Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,</a>
<a id='line_5223'>  Than when I told you first of such a charm.</a>
<a id='line_5224'>  Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,</a>
<a id='line_5225'>  Too much I trusted when I told you that,</a>
<a id='line_5226'>  And stirred this vice in you which ruined man</a>
<a id='line_5227'>  Through woman the first hour; for howsoe'er</a>
<a id='line_5228'>  In children a great curiousness be well,</a>
<a id='line_5229'>  Who have to learn themselves and all the world,</a>
<a id='line_5230'>  In you, that are no child, for still I find</a>
<a id='line_5231'>  Your face is practised when I spell the lines,</a>
<a id='line_5232'>  I call it,--well, I will not call it vice:</a>
<a id='line_5233'>  But since you name yourself the summer fly,</a>
<a id='line_5234'>  I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,</a>
<a id='line_5235'>  That settles, beaten back, and beaten back</a>
<a id='line_5236'>  Settles, till one could yield for weariness:</a>
<a id='line_5237'>  But since I will not yield to give you power</a>
<a id='line_5238'>  Upon my life and use and name and fame,</a>
<a id='line_5239'>  Why will ye never ask some other boon?</a>
<a id='line_5240'>  Yea, by God's rood, I trusted you too much.'</a>
<a id='line_5241'></a>
<a id='line_5242'>     And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid</a>
<a id='line_5243'>  That ever bided tryst at village stile,</a>
<a id='line_5244'>  Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:</a>
<a id='line_5245'>  'Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;</a>
<a id='line_5246'>  Caress her:  let her feel herself forgiven</a>
<a id='line_5247'>  Who feels no heart to ask another boon.</a>
<a id='line_5248'>  I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme</a>
<a id='line_5249'>  Of "trust me not at all or all in all."</a>
<a id='line_5250'>  I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,</a>
<a id='line_5251'>  And it shall answer for me.  Listen to it.</a>
<a id='line_5252'></a>
<a id='line_5253'>     "In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,</a>
<a id='line_5254'>  Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers:</a>
<a id='line_5255'>  Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.</a>
<a id='line_5256'></a>
<a id='line_5257'>     "It is the little rift within the lute,</a>
<a id='line_5258'>  That by and by will make the music mute,</a>
<a id='line_5259'>  And ever widening slowly silence all.</a>
<a id='line_5260'></a>
<a id='line_5261'>     "The little rift within the lover's lute</a>
<a id='line_5262'>  Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,</a>
<a id='line_5263'>  That rotting inward slowly moulders all.</a>
<a id='line_5264'></a>
<a id='line_5265'>     "It is not worth the keeping:  let it go:</a>
<a id='line_5266'>  But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.</a>
<a id='line_5267'>  And trust me not at all or all in all."</a>
<a id='line_5268'></a>
<a id='line_5269'>  O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?'</a>
<a id='line_5270'></a>
<a id='line_5271'>     And Merlin looked and half believed her true,</a>
<a id='line_5272'>  So tender was her voice, so fair her face,</a>
<a id='line_5273'>  So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears</a>
<a id='line_5274'>  Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:</a>
<a id='line_5275'>  And yet he answered half indignantly:</a>
<a id='line_5276'></a>
<a id='line_5277'>     'Far other was the song that once I heard</a>
<a id='line_5278'>  By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:</a>
<a id='line_5279'>  For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,</a>
<a id='line_5280'>  To chase a creature that was current then</a>
<a id='line_5281'>  In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.</a>
<a id='line_5282'>  It was the time when first the question rose</a>
<a id='line_5283'>  About the founding of a Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_5284'>  That was to be, for love of God and men</a>
<a id='line_5285'>  And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.</a>
<a id='line_5286'>  And each incited each to noble deeds.</a>
<a id='line_5287'>  And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,</a>
<a id='line_5288'>  We could not keep him silent, out he flashed,</a>
<a id='line_5289'>  And into such a song, such fire for fame,</a>
<a id='line_5290'>  Such trumpet-glowings in it, coming down</a>
<a id='line_5291'>  To such a stern and iron-clashing close,</a>
<a id='line_5292'>  That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,</a>
<a id='line_5293'>  And should have done it; but the beauteous beast</a>
<a id='line_5294'>  Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,</a>
<a id='line_5295'>  And like a silver shadow slipt away</a>
<a id='line_5296'>  Through the dim land; and all day long we rode</a>
<a id='line_5297'>  Through the dim land against a rushing wind,</a>
<a id='line_5298'>  That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,</a>
<a id='line_5299'>  And chased the flashes of his golden horns</a>
<a id='line_5300'>  Till they vanished by the fairy well</a>
<a id='line_5301'>  That laughs at iron--as our warriors did--</a>
<a id='line_5302'>  Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,</a>
<a id='line_5303'>  "Laugh, little well!" but touch it with a sword,</a>
<a id='line_5304'>  It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there</a>
<a id='line_5305'>  We lost him:  such a noble song was that.</a>
<a id='line_5306'>  But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,</a>
<a id='line_5307'>  I felt as though you knew this cursed charm,</a>
<a id='line_5308'>  Were proving it on me, and that I lay</a>
<a id='line_5309'>  And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame.'</a>
<a id='line_5310'></a>
<a id='line_5311'>     And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:</a>
<a id='line_5312'>  'O mine have ebbed away for evermore,</a>
<a id='line_5313'>  And all through following you to this wild wood,</a>
<a id='line_5314'>  Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.</a>
<a id='line_5315'>  Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount</a>
<a id='line_5316'>  As high as woman in her selfless mood.</a>
<a id='line_5317'>  And touching fame, howe'er ye scorn my song,</a>
<a id='line_5318'>  Take one verse more--the lady speaks it--this:</a>
<a id='line_5319'></a>
<a id='line_5320'>     '"My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,</a>
<a id='line_5321'>  For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,</a>
<a id='line_5322'>  And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.</a>
<a id='line_5323'>  So trust me not at all or all in all."</a>
<a id='line_5324'></a>
<a id='line_5325'>     'Says she not well? and there is more--this rhyme</a>
<a id='line_5326'>  Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_5327'>  That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;</a>
<a id='line_5328'>  Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.</a>
<a id='line_5329'>  But nevermore the same two sister pearls</a>
<a id='line_5330'>  Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other</a>
<a id='line_5331'>  On her white neck--so is it with this rhyme:</a>
<a id='line_5332'>  It lives dispersedly in many hands,</a>
<a id='line_5333'>  And every minstrel sings it differently;</a>
<a id='line_5334'>  Yet is there one true line, the pearl of pearls:</a>
<a id='line_5335'>  "Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love."</a>
<a id='line_5336'>  Yea!  Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves</a>
<a id='line_5337'>  A portion from the solid present, eats</a>
<a id='line_5338'>  And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,</a>
<a id='line_5339'>  The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;</a>
<a id='line_5340'>  And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,</a>
<a id='line_5341'>  And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself</a>
<a id='line_5342'>  Know well that Envy calls you Devil's son,</a>
<a id='line_5343'>  And since ye seem the Master of all Art,</a>
<a id='line_5344'>  They fain would make you Master of all vice.'</a>
<a id='line_5345'></a>
<a id='line_5346'>     And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,</a>
<a id='line_5347'>  'I once was looking for a magic weed,</a>
<a id='line_5348'>  And found a fair young squire who sat alone,</a>
<a id='line_5349'>  Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,</a>
<a id='line_5350'>  And then was painting on it fancied arms,</a>
<a id='line_5351'>  Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun</a>
<a id='line_5352'>  In dexter chief; the scroll "I follow fame."</a>
<a id='line_5353'>  And speaking not, but leaning over him</a>
<a id='line_5354'>  I took his brush and blotted out the bird,</a>
<a id='line_5355'>  And made a Gardener putting in a graff,</a>
<a id='line_5356'>  With this for motto, "Rather use than fame."</a>
<a id='line_5357'>  You should have seen him blush; but afterwards</a>
<a id='line_5358'>  He made a stalwart knight.  O Vivien,</a>
<a id='line_5359'>  For you, methinks you think you love me well;</a>
<a id='line_5360'>  For me, I love you somewhat; rest:  and Love</a>
<a id='line_5361'>  Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,</a>
<a id='line_5362'>  Not ever be too curious for a boon,</a>
<a id='line_5363'>  Too prurient for a proof against the grain</a>
<a id='line_5364'>  Of him ye say ye love:  but Fame with men,</a>
<a id='line_5365'>  Being but ampler means to serve mankind,</a>
<a id='line_5366'>  Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,</a>
<a id='line_5367'>  But work as vassal to the larger love,</a>
<a id='line_5368'>  That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.</a>
<a id='line_5369'>  Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again</a>
<a id='line_5370'>  Increasing gave me use.  Lo, there my boon!</a>
<a id='line_5371'>  What other? for men sought to prove me vile,</a>
<a id='line_5372'>  Because I fain had given them greater wits:</a>
<a id='line_5373'>  And then did Envy call me Devil's son:</a>
<a id='line_5374'>  The sick weak beast seeking to help herself</a>
<a id='line_5375'>  By striking at her better, missed, and brought</a>
<a id='line_5376'>  Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.</a>
<a id='line_5377'>  Sweet were the days when I was all unknown,</a>
<a id='line_5378'>  But when my name was lifted up, the storm</a>
<a id='line_5379'>  Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.</a>
<a id='line_5380'>  Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,</a>
<a id='line_5381'>  Yet needs must work my work.  That other fame,</a>
<a id='line_5382'>  To one at least, who hath not children, vague,</a>
<a id='line_5383'>  The cackle of the unborn about the grave,</a>
<a id='line_5384'>  I cared not for it:  a single misty star,</a>
<a id='line_5385'>  Which is the second in a line of stars</a>
<a id='line_5386'>  That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,</a>
<a id='line_5387'>  I never gazed upon it but I dreamt</a>
<a id='line_5388'>  Of some vast charm concluded in that star</a>
<a id='line_5389'>  To make fame nothing.  Wherefore, if I fear,</a>
<a id='line_5390'>  Giving you power upon me through this charm,</a>
<a id='line_5391'>  That you might play me falsely, having power,</a>
<a id='line_5392'>  However well ye think ye love me now</a>
<a id='line_5393'>  (As sons of kings loving in pupilage</a>
<a id='line_5394'>  Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)</a>
<a id='line_5395'>  I rather dread the loss of use than fame;</a>
<a id='line_5396'>  If you--and not so much from wickedness,</a>
<a id='line_5397'>  As some wild turn of anger, or a mood</a>
<a id='line_5398'>  Of overstrained affection, it may be,</a>
<a id='line_5399'>  To keep me all to your own self,--or else</a>
<a id='line_5400'>  A sudden spurt of woman's jealousy,--</a>
<a id='line_5401'>  Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love.'</a>
<a id='line_5402'></a>
<a id='line_5403'>     And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:</a>
<a id='line_5404'>  'Have I not sworn?  I am not trusted.  Good!</a>
<a id='line_5405'>  Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;</a>
<a id='line_5406'>  And being found take heed of Vivien.</a>
<a id='line_5407'>  A woman and not trusted, doubtless I</a>
<a id='line_5408'>  Might feel some sudden turn of anger born</a>
<a id='line_5409'>  Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet</a>
<a id='line_5410'>  Is accurate too, for this full love of mine</a>
<a id='line_5411'>  Without the full heart back may merit well</a>
<a id='line_5412'>  Your term of overstrained.  So used as I,</a>
<a id='line_5413'>  My daily wonder is, I love at all.</a>
<a id='line_5414'>  And as to woman's jealousy, O why not?</a>
<a id='line_5415'>  O to what end, except a jealous one,</a>
<a id='line_5416'>  And one to make me jealous if I love,</a>
<a id='line_5417'>  Was this fair charm invented by yourself?</a>
<a id='line_5418'>  I well believe that all about this world</a>
<a id='line_5419'>  Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,</a>
<a id='line_5420'>  Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower</a>
<a id='line_5421'>  From which is no escape for evermore.'</a>
<a id='line_5422'></a>
<a id='line_5423'>     Then the great Master merrily answered her:</a>
<a id='line_5424'>  'Full many a love in loving youth was mine;</a>
<a id='line_5425'>  I needed then no charm to keep them mine</a>
<a id='line_5426'>  But youth and love; and that full heart of yours</a>
<a id='line_5427'>  Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;</a>
<a id='line_5428'>  So live uncharmed.  For those who wrought it first,</a>
<a id='line_5429'>  The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,</a>
<a id='line_5430'>  The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones</a>
<a id='line_5431'>  Who paced it, ages back:  but will ye hear</a>
<a id='line_5432'>  The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?</a>
<a id='line_5433'></a>
<a id='line_5434'>     'There lived a king in the most Eastern East,</a>
<a id='line_5435'>  Less old than I, yet older, for my blood</a>
<a id='line_5436'>  Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.</a>
<a id='line_5437'>  A tawny pirate anchored in his port,</a>
<a id='line_5438'>  Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;</a>
<a id='line_5439'>  And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,</a>
<a id='line_5440'>  He saw two cities in a thousand boats</a>
<a id='line_5441'>  All fighting for a woman on the sea.</a>
<a id='line_5442'>  And pushing his black craft among them all,</a>
<a id='line_5443'>  He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,</a>
<a id='line_5444'>  With loss of half his people arrow-slain;</a>
<a id='line_5445'>  A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,</a>
<a id='line_5446'>  They said a light came from her when she moved:</a>
<a id='line_5447'>  And since the pirate would not yield her up,</a>
<a id='line_5448'>  The King impaled him for his piracy;</a>
<a id='line_5449'>  Then made her Queen:  but those isle-nurtured eyes</a>
<a id='line_5450'>  Waged such unwilling though successful war</a>
<a id='line_5451'>  On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,</a>
<a id='line_5452'>  And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew</a>
<a id='line_5453'>  The rustiest iron of old fighters' hearts;</a>
<a id='line_5454'>  And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt</a>
<a id='line_5455'>  Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back</a>
<a id='line_5456'>  That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees</a>
<a id='line_5457'>  Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,</a>
<a id='line_5458'>  To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.</a>
<a id='line_5459'>  What wonder, being jealous, that he sent</a>
<a id='line_5460'>  His horns of proclamation out through all</a>
<a id='line_5461'>  The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed</a>
<a id='line_5462'>  To find a wizard who might teach the King</a>
<a id='line_5463'>  Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen</a>
<a id='line_5464'>  Might keep her all his own:  to such a one</a>
<a id='line_5465'>  He promised more than ever king has given,</a>
<a id='line_5466'>  A league of mountain full of golden mines,</a>
<a id='line_5467'>  A province with a hundred miles of coast,</a>
<a id='line_5468'>  A palace and a princess, all for him:</a>
<a id='line_5469'>  But on all those who tried and failed, the King</a>
<a id='line_5470'>  Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it</a>
<a id='line_5471'>  To keep the list low and pretenders back,</a>
<a id='line_5472'>  Or like a king, not to be trifled with--</a>
<a id='line_5473'>  Their heads should moulder on the city gates.</a>
<a id='line_5474'>  And many tried and failed, because the charm</a>
<a id='line_5475'>  Of nature in her overbore their own:</a>
<a id='line_5476'>  And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:</a>
<a id='line_5477'>  And many weeks a troop of carrion crows</a>
<a id='line_5478'>  Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.'</a>
<a id='line_5479'></a>
<a id='line_5480'>     And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:</a>
<a id='line_5481'>  'I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,</a>
<a id='line_5482'>  Thy tongue has tript a little:  ask thyself.</a>
<a id='line_5483'>  The lady never made unwilling war</a>
<a id='line_5484'>  With those fine eyes:  she had her pleasure in it,</a>
<a id='line_5485'>  And made her good man jealous with good cause.</a>
<a id='line_5486'>  And lived there neither dame nor damsel then</a>
<a id='line_5487'>  Wroth at a lover's loss? were all as tame,</a>
<a id='line_5488'>  I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?</a>
<a id='line_5489'>  Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5490'>  Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,</a>
<a id='line_5491'>  Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?</a>
<a id='line_5492'>  Well, those were not our days:  but did they find</a>
<a id='line_5493'>  A wizard?  Tell me, was he like to thee?</a>
<a id='line_5494'></a>
<a id='line_5495'>     She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck</a>
<a id='line_5496'>  Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes</a>
<a id='line_5497'>  Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride's</a>
<a id='line_5498'>  On her new lord, her own, the first of men.</a>
<a id='line_5499'></a>
<a id='line_5500'>     He answered laughing, 'Nay, not like to me.</a>
<a id='line_5501'>  At last they found--his foragers for charms--</a>
<a id='line_5502'>  A little glassy-headed hairless man,</a>
<a id='line_5503'>  Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;</a>
<a id='line_5504'>  Read but one book, and ever reading grew</a>
<a id='line_5505'>  So grated down and filed away with thought,</a>
<a id='line_5506'>  So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin</a>
<a id='line_5507'>  Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.</a>
<a id='line_5508'>  And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,</a>
<a id='line_5509'>  Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,</a>
<a id='line_5510'>  Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall</a>
<a id='line_5511'>  That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men</a>
<a id='line_5512'>  Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,</a>
<a id='line_5513'>  And heard their voices talk behind the wall,</a>
<a id='line_5514'>  And learnt their elemental secrets, powers</a>
<a id='line_5515'>  And forces; often o'er the sun's bright eye</a>
<a id='line_5516'>  Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,</a>
<a id='line_5517'>  And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;</a>
<a id='line_5518'>  Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,</a>
<a id='line_5519'>  When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,</a>
<a id='line_5520'>  And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned</a>
<a id='line_5521'>  The world to peace again:  here was the man.</a>
<a id='line_5522'>  And so by force they dragged him to the King.</a>
<a id='line_5523'>  And then he taught the King to charm the Queen</a>
<a id='line_5524'>  In such-wise, that no man could see her more,</a>
<a id='line_5525'>  Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,</a>
<a id='line_5526'>  Coming and going, and she lay as dead,</a>
<a id='line_5527'>  And lost all use of life:  but when the King</a>
<a id='line_5528'>  Made proffer of the league of golden mines,</a>
<a id='line_5529'>  The province with a hundred miles of coast,</a>
<a id='line_5530'>  The palace and the princess, that old man</a>
<a id='line_5531'>  Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,</a>
<a id='line_5532'>  And vanished, and his book came down to me.'</a>
<a id='line_5533'></a>
<a id='line_5534'>     And Vivien answered smiling saucily:</a>
<a id='line_5535'>  'Ye have the book:  the charm is written in it:</a>
<a id='line_5536'>  Good:  take my counsel:  let me know it at once:</a>
<a id='line_5537'>  For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,</a>
<a id='line_5538'>  With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,</a>
<a id='line_5539'>  And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound</a>
<a id='line_5540'>  As after furious battle turfs the slain</a>
<a id='line_5541'>  On some wild down above the windy deep,</a>
<a id='line_5542'>  I yet should strike upon a sudden means</a>
<a id='line_5543'>  To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:</a>
<a id='line_5544'>  Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?'</a>
<a id='line_5545'></a>
<a id='line_5546'>     And smiling as a master smiles at one</a>
<a id='line_5547'>  That is not of his school, nor any school</a>
<a id='line_5548'>  But that where blind and naked Ignorance</a>
<a id='line_5549'>  Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,</a>
<a id='line_5550'>  On all things all day long, he answered her:</a>
<a id='line_5551'></a>
<a id='line_5552'>     'Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!</a>
<a id='line_5553'>  O ay, it is but twenty pages long,</a>
<a id='line_5554'>  But every page having an ample marge,</a>
<a id='line_5555'>  And every marge enclosing in the midst</a>
<a id='line_5556'>  A square of text that looks a little blot,</a>
<a id='line_5557'>  The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;</a>
<a id='line_5558'>  And every square of text an awful charm,</a>
<a id='line_5559'>  Writ in a language that has long gone by.</a>
<a id='line_5560'>  So long, that mountains have arisen since</a>
<a id='line_5561'>  With cities on their flanks--thou read the book!</a>
<a id='line_5562'>  And ever margin scribbled, crost, and crammed</a>
<a id='line_5563'>  With comment, densest condensation, hard</a>
<a id='line_5564'>  To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights</a>
<a id='line_5565'>  Of my long life have made it easy to me.</a>
<a id='line_5566'>  And none can read the text, not even I;</a>
<a id='line_5567'>  And none can read the comment but myself;</a>
<a id='line_5568'>  And in the comment did I find the charm.</a>
<a id='line_5569'>  O, the results are simple; a mere child</a>
<a id='line_5570'>  Might use it to the harm of anyone,</a>
<a id='line_5571'>  And never could undo it:  ask no more:</a>
<a id='line_5572'>  For though you should not prove it upon me,</a>
<a id='line_5573'>  But keep that oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,</a>
<a id='line_5574'>  Assay it on some one of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_5575'>  And all because ye dream they babble of you.'</a>
<a id='line_5576'></a>
<a id='line_5577'>     And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:</a>
<a id='line_5578'>  'What dare the full-fed liars say of me?</a>
<a id='line_5579'>  They ride abroad redressing human wrongs!</a>
<a id='line_5580'>  They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!</a>
<a id='line_5581'>  They bound to holy vows of chastity!</a>
<a id='line_5582'>  Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.</a>
<a id='line_5583'>  But you are man, you well can understand</a>
<a id='line_5584'>  The shame that cannot be explained for shame.</a>
<a id='line_5585'>  Not one of all the drove should touch me:  swine!'</a>
<a id='line_5586'></a>
<a id='line_5587'>     Then answered Merlin careless of her words:</a>
<a id='line_5588'>  'You breathe but accusation vast and vague,</a>
<a id='line_5589'>  Spleen-born, I think, and proofless.  If ye know,</a>
<a id='line_5590'>  Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!'</a>
<a id='line_5591'></a>
<a id='line_5592'>     And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:</a>
<a id='line_5593'>  'O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him</a>
<a id='line_5594'>  Whose kinsman left him watcher o'er his wife</a>
<a id='line_5595'>  And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;</a>
<a id='line_5596'>  Was one year gone, and on returning found</a>
<a id='line_5597'>  Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one</a>
<a id='line_5598'>  But one hour old!  What said the happy sire?'</a>
<a id='line_5599'>  A seven-months' babe had been a truer gift.</a>
<a id='line_5600'>  Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood.'</a>
<a id='line_5601'></a>
<a id='line_5602'>     Then answered Merlin, 'Nay, I know the tale.</a>
<a id='line_5603'>  Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:</a>
<a id='line_5604'>  Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:</a>
<a id='line_5605'>  One child they had:  it lived with her:  she died:</a>
<a id='line_5606'>  His kinsman travelling on his own affair</a>
<a id='line_5607'>  Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.</a>
<a id='line_5608'>  He brought, not found it therefore:  take the truth.'</a>
<a id='line_5609'></a>
<a id='line_5610'>     'O ay,' said Vivien, 'overtrue a tale.</a>
<a id='line_5611'>  What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,</a>
<a id='line_5612'>  That ardent man? "to pluck the flower in season,"</a>
<a id='line_5613'>  So says the song, "I trow it is no treason."</a>
<a id='line_5614'>  O Master, shall we call him overquick</a>
<a id='line_5615'>  To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?'</a>
<a id='line_5616'></a>
<a id='line_5617'>     And Merlin answered, 'Overquick art thou</a>
<a id='line_5618'>  To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing</a>
<a id='line_5619'>  Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey</a>
<a id='line_5620'>  Is man's good name:  he never wronged his bride.</a>
<a id='line_5621'>  I know the tale.  An angry gust of wind</a>
<a id='line_5622'>  Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed</a>
<a id='line_5623'>  And many-corridored complexities</a>
<a id='line_5624'>  Of Arthur's palace:  then he found a door,</a>
<a id='line_5625'>  And darkling felt the sculptured ornament</a>
<a id='line_5626'>  That wreathen round it made it seem his own;</a>
<a id='line_5627'>  And wearied out made for the couch and slept,</a>
<a id='line_5628'>  A stainless man beside a stainless maid;</a>
<a id='line_5629'>  And either slept, nor knew of other there;</a>
<a id='line_5630'>  Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose</a>
<a id='line_5631'>  In Arthur's casement glimmered chastely down,</a>
<a id='line_5632'>  Blushing upon them blushing, and at once</a>
<a id='line_5633'>  He rose without a word and parted from her:</a>
<a id='line_5634'>  But when the thing was blazed about the court,</a>
<a id='line_5635'>  The brute world howling forced them into bonds,</a>
<a id='line_5636'>  And as it chanced they are happy, being pure.'</a>
<a id='line_5637'></a>
<a id='line_5638'>     'O ay,' said Vivien, 'that were likely too.</a>
<a id='line_5639'>  What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_5640'>  And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,</a>
<a id='line_5641'>  The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,</a>
<a id='line_5642'>  Or some black wether of St Satan's fold.</a>
<a id='line_5643'>  What, in the precincts of the chapel-yard,</a>
<a id='line_5644'>  Among the knightly brasses of the graves,</a>
<a id='line_5645'>  And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!'</a>
<a id='line_5646'></a>
<a id='line_5647'>     And Merlin answered careless of her charge,</a>
<a id='line_5648'>  'A sober man is Percivale and pure;</a>
<a id='line_5649'>  But once in life was flustered with new wine,</a>
<a id='line_5650'>  Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;</a>
<a id='line_5651'>  Where one of Satan's shepherdesses caught</a>
<a id='line_5652'>  And meant to stamp him with her master's mark;</a>
<a id='line_5653'>  And that he sinned is not believable;</a>
<a id='line_5654'>  For, look upon his face!--but if he sinned,</a>
<a id='line_5655'>  The sin that practice burns into the blood,</a>
<a id='line_5656'>  And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,</a>
<a id='line_5657'>  Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:</a>
<a id='line_5658'>  Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns</a>
<a id='line_5659'>  Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.</a>
<a id='line_5660'>  But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?'</a>
<a id='line_5661'></a>
<a id='line_5662'>     And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:</a>
<a id='line_5663'>  'O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend</a>
<a id='line_5664'>  Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_5665'>  I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,</a>
<a id='line_5666'>  Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?'</a>
<a id='line_5667'></a>
<a id='line_5668'>     To which he answered sadly, 'Yea, I know it.</a>
<a id='line_5669'>  Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first,</a>
<a id='line_5670'>  To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.</a>
<a id='line_5671'>  A rumour runs, she took him for the King,</a>
<a id='line_5672'>  So fixt her fancy on him:  let them be.</a>
<a id='line_5673'>  But have ye no one word of loyal praise</a>
<a id='line_5674'>  For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?'</a>
<a id='line_5675'></a>
<a id='line_5676'>     She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:</a>
<a id='line_5677'>  'Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?</a>
<a id='line_5678'>  Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?</a>
<a id='line_5679'>  By which the good King means to blind himself,</a>
<a id='line_5680'>  And blinds himself and all the Table Round</a>
<a id='line_5681'>  To all the foulness that they work.  Myself</a>
<a id='line_5682'>  Could call him (were it not for womanhood)</a>
<a id='line_5683'>  The pretty, popular cause such manhood earns,</a>
<a id='line_5684'>  Could call him the main cause of all their crime;</a>
<a id='line_5685'>  Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool.'</a>
<a id='line_5686'></a>
<a id='line_5687'>     Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:</a>
<a id='line_5688'>  'O true and tender!  O my liege and King!</a>
<a id='line_5689'>  O selfless man and stainless gentleman,</a>
<a id='line_5690'>  Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain</a>
<a id='line_5691'>  Have all men true and leal, all women pure;</a>
<a id='line_5692'>  How, in the mouths of base interpreters,</a>
<a id='line_5693'>  From over-fineness not intelligible</a>
<a id='line_5694'>  To things with every sense as false and foul</a>
<a id='line_5695'>  As the poached filth that floods the middle street,</a>
<a id='line_5696'>  Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!'</a>
<a id='line_5697'></a>
<a id='line_5698'>     But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne</a>
<a id='line_5699'>  By instance, recommenced, and let her tongue</a>
<a id='line_5700'>  Rage like a fire among the noblest names,</a>
<a id='line_5701'>  Polluting, and imputing her whole self,</a>
<a id='line_5702'>  Defaming and defacing, till she left</a>
<a id='line_5703'>  Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.</a>
<a id='line_5704'></a>
<a id='line_5705'>     Her words had issue other than she willed.</a>
<a id='line_5706'>  He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made</a>
<a id='line_5707'>  A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5708'>  And muttered in himself, 'Tell her the charm!</a>
<a id='line_5709'>  So, if she had it, would she rail on me</a>
<a id='line_5710'>  To snare the next, and if she have it not</a>
<a id='line_5711'>  So will she rail.  What did the wanton say?</a>
<a id='line_5712'>  "Not mount as high;" we scarce can sink as low:</a>
<a id='line_5713'>  For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,</a>
<a id='line_5714'>  But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.</a>
<a id='line_5715'>  I know the Table Round, my friends of old;</a>
<a id='line_5716'>  All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.</a>
<a id='line_5717'>  She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;</a>
<a id='line_5718'>  I well believe she tempted them and failed,</a>
<a id='line_5719'>  Being so bitter:  for fine plots may fail,</a>
<a id='line_5720'>  Though harlots paint their talk as well as face</a>
<a id='line_5721'>  With colours of the heart that are not theirs.</a>
<a id='line_5722'>  I will not let her know:  nine tithes of times</a>
<a id='line_5723'>  Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.</a>
<a id='line_5724'>  And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime</a>
<a id='line_5725'>  Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,</a>
<a id='line_5726'>  Wanting the mental range; or low desire</a>
<a id='line_5727'>  Not to feel lowest makes them level all;</a>
<a id='line_5728'>  Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,</a>
<a id='line_5729'>  To leave an equal baseness; and in this</a>
<a id='line_5730'>  Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find</a>
<a id='line_5731'>  Some stain or blemish in a name of note,</a>
<a id='line_5732'>  Not grieving that their greatest are so small,</a>
<a id='line_5733'>  Inflate themselves with some insane delight,</a>
<a id='line_5734'>  And judge all nature from her feet of clay,</a>
<a id='line_5735'>  Without the will to lift their eyes, and see</a>
<a id='line_5736'>  Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,</a>
<a id='line_5737'>  And touching other worlds.  I am weary of her.'</a>
<a id='line_5738'></a>
<a id='line_5739'>     He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,</a>
<a id='line_5740'>  Half-suffocated in the hoary fell</a>
<a id='line_5741'>  And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.</a>
<a id='line_5742'>  But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,</a>
<a id='line_5743'>  And hearing 'harlot' muttered twice or thrice,</a>
<a id='line_5744'>  Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood</a>
<a id='line_5745'>  Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,</a>
<a id='line_5746'>  How from the rosy lips of life and love,</a>
<a id='line_5747'>  Flashed the bare-grinning skeleton of death!</a>
<a id='line_5748'>  White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed</a>
<a id='line_5749'>  Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched</a>
<a id='line_5750'>  Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,</a>
<a id='line_5751'>  And feeling; had she found a dagger there</a>
<a id='line_5752'>  (For in a wink the false love turns to hate)</a>
<a id='line_5753'>  She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:</a>
<a id='line_5754'>  His eye was calm, and suddenly she took</a>
<a id='line_5755'>  To bitter weeping like a beaten child,</a>
<a id='line_5756'>  A long, long weeping, not consolable.</a>
<a id='line_5757'>  Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:</a>
<a id='line_5758'></a>
<a id='line_5759'>     'O crueller than was ever told in tale,</a>
<a id='line_5760'>  Or sung in song!  O vainly lavished love!</a>
<a id='line_5761'>  O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,</a>
<a id='line_5762'>  Or seeming shameful--for what shame in love,</a>
<a id='line_5763'>  So love be true, and not as yours is--nothing</a>
<a id='line_5764'>  Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust</a>
<a id='line_5765'>  Who called her what he called her--all her crime,</a>
<a id='line_5766'>  All--all--the wish to prove him wholly hers.'</a>
<a id='line_5767'></a>
<a id='line_5768'>     She mused a little, and then clapt her hands</a>
<a id='line_5769'>  Together with a wailing shriek, and said:</a>
<a id='line_5770'>  'Stabbed through the heart's affections to the heart!</a>
<a id='line_5771'>  Seethed like the kid in its own mother's milk!</a>
<a id='line_5772'>  Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!</a>
<a id='line_5773'>  I thought that he was gentle, being great:</a>
<a id='line_5774'>  O God, that I had loved a smaller man!</a>
<a id='line_5775'>  I should have found in him a greater heart.</a>
<a id='line_5776'>  O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw</a>
<a id='line_5777'>  The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,</a>
<a id='line_5778'>  Who loved to make men darker than they are,</a>
<a id='line_5779'>  Because of that high pleasure which I had</a>
<a id='line_5780'>  To seat you sole upon my pedestal</a>
<a id='line_5781'>  Of worship--I am answered, and henceforth</a>
<a id='line_5782'>  The course of life that seemed so flowery to me</a>
<a id='line_5783'>  With you for guide and master, only you,</a>
<a id='line_5784'>  Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,</a>
<a id='line_5785'>  And ending in a ruin--nothing left,</a>
<a id='line_5786'>  But into some low cave to crawl, and there,</a>
<a id='line_5787'>  If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,</a>
<a id='line_5788'>  Killed with inutterable unkindliness.'</a>
<a id='line_5789'></a>
<a id='line_5790'>     She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,</a>
<a id='line_5791'>  The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid</a>
<a id='line_5792'>  Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,</a>
<a id='line_5793'>  And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm</a>
<a id='line_5794'>  In silence, while his anger slowly died</a>
<a id='line_5795'>  Within him, till he let his wisdom go</a>
<a id='line_5796'>  For ease of heart, and half believed her true:</a>
<a id='line_5797'>  Called her to shelter in the hollow oak,</a>
<a id='line_5798'>  'Come from the storm,' and having no reply,</a>
<a id='line_5799'>  Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face</a>
<a id='line_5800'>  Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;</a>
<a id='line_5801'>  Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,</a>
<a id='line_5802'>  To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.</a>
<a id='line_5803'>  At last she let herself be conquered by him,</a>
<a id='line_5804'>  And as the cageling newly flown returns,</a>
<a id='line_5805'>  The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing</a>
<a id='line_5806'>  Came to her old perch back, and settled there.</a>
<a id='line_5807'>  There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,</a>
<a id='line_5808'>  Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw</a>
<a id='line_5809'>  The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,</a>
<a id='line_5810'>  About her, more in kindness than in love,</a>
<a id='line_5811'>  The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.</a>
<a id='line_5812'>  But she dislinked herself at once and rose,</a>
<a id='line_5813'>  Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,</a>
<a id='line_5814'>  A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,</a>
<a id='line_5815'>  Upright and flushed before him:  then she said:</a>
<a id='line_5816'></a>
<a id='line_5817'>     'There must now be no passages of love</a>
<a id='line_5818'>  Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;</a>
<a id='line_5819'>  Since, if I be what I am grossly called,</a>
<a id='line_5820'>  What should be granted which your own gross heart</a>
<a id='line_5821'>  Would reckon worth the taking?  I will go.</a>
<a id='line_5822'>  In truth, but one thing now--better have died</a>
<a id='line_5823'>  Thrice than have asked it once--could make me stay--</a>
<a id='line_5824'>  That proof of trust--so often asked in vain!</a>
<a id='line_5825'>  How justly, after that vile term of yours,</a>
<a id='line_5826'>  I find with grief!  I might believe you then,</a>
<a id='line_5827'>  Who knows? once more.  Lo! what was once to me</a>
<a id='line_5828'>  Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown</a>
<a id='line_5829'>  The vast necessity of heart and life.</a>
<a id='line_5830'>  Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear</a>
<a id='line_5831'>  My fate or folly, passing gayer youth</a>
<a id='line_5832'>  For one so old, must be to love thee still.</a>
<a id='line_5833'>  But ere I leave thee let me swear once more</a>
<a id='line_5834'>  That if I schemed against thy peace in this,</a>
<a id='line_5835'>  May yon just heaven, that darkens o'er me, send</a>
<a id='line_5836'>  One flash, that, missing all things else, may make</a>
<a id='line_5837'>  My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie.'</a>
<a id='line_5838'></a>
<a id='line_5839'>     Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt</a>
<a id='line_5840'>  (For now the storm was close above them) struck,</a>
<a id='line_5841'>  Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining</a>
<a id='line_5842'>  With darted spikes and splinters of the wood</a>
<a id='line_5843'>  The dark earth round.  He raised his eyes and saw</a>
<a id='line_5844'>  The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.</a>
<a id='line_5845'>  But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,</a>
<a id='line_5846'>  And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,</a>
<a id='line_5847'>  And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps</a>
<a id='line_5848'>  That followed, flying back and crying out,</a>
<a id='line_5849'>  'O Merlin, though you do not love me, save,</a>
<a id='line_5850'>  Yet save me!' clung to him and hugged him close;</a>
<a id='line_5851'>  And called him dear protector in her fright,</a>
<a id='line_5852'>  Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,</a>
<a id='line_5853'>  But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.</a>
<a id='line_5854'>  The pale blood of the wizard at her touch</a>
<a id='line_5855'>  Took gayer colours, like an opal warmed.</a>
<a id='line_5856'>  She blamed herself for telling hearsay tales:</a>
<a id='line_5857'>  She shook from fear, and for her fault she wept</a>
<a id='line_5858'>  Of petulancy; she called him lord and liege,</a>
<a id='line_5859'>  Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>  Her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love</a>
<a id='line_5861'>  Of her whole life; and ever overhead</a>
<a id='line_5862'>  Bellowed the tempest, and the rotten branch</a>
<a id='line_5863'>  Snapt in the rushing of the river-rain</a>
<a id='line_5864'>  Above them; and in change of glare and gloom</a>
<a id='line_5865'>  Her eyes and neck glittering went and came;</a>
<a id='line_5866'>  Till now the storm, its burst of passion spent,</a>
<a id='line_5867'>  Moaning and calling out of other lands,</a>
<a id='line_5868'>  Had left the ravaged woodland yet once more</a>
<a id='line_5869'>  To peace; and what should not have been had been,</a>
<a id='line_5870'>  For Merlin, overtalked and overworn,</a>
<a id='line_5871'>  Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept.</a>
<a id='line_5872'></a>
<a id='line_5873'>     Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm</a>
<a id='line_5874'>  Of woven paces and of waving hands,</a>
<a id='line_5875'>  And in the hollow oak he lay as dead,</a>
<a id='line_5876'>  And lost to life and use and name and fame.</a>
<a id='line_5877'></a>
<a id='line_5878'>     Then crying 'I have made his glory mine,'</a>
<a id='line_5879'>  And shrieking out 'O fool!' the harlot leapt</a>
<a id='line_5880'>  Adown the forest, and the thicket closed</a>
<a id='line_5881'>  Behind her, and the forest echoed 'fool.'</a>
<a id='line_5882'></a>
<a id='line_5883'></a>
<a id='line_5884'></a>
<a id='line_5885'>  Lancelot and Elaine</a>
<a id='line_5886'></a>
<a id='line_5887'>  Elaine the fair, Elaine the loveable,</a>
<a id='line_5888'>  Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat,</a>
<a id='line_5889'>  High in her chamber up a tower to the east</a>
<a id='line_5890'>  Guarded the sacred shield of Lancelot;</a>
<a id='line_5891'>  Which first she placed where the morning's earliest ray</a>
<a id='line_5892'>  Might strike it, and awake her with the gleam;</a>
<a id='line_5893'>  Then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it</a>
<a id='line_5894'>  A case of silk, and braided thereupon</a>
<a id='line_5895'>  All the devices blazoned on the shield</a>
<a id='line_5896'>  In their own tinct, and added, of her wit,</a>
<a id='line_5897'>  A border fantasy of branch and flower,</a>
<a id='line_5898'>  And yellow-throated nestling in the nest.</a>
<a id='line_5899'>  Nor rested thus content, but day by day,</a>
<a id='line_5900'>  Leaving her household and good father, climbed</a>
<a id='line_5901'>  That eastern tower, and entering barred her door,</a>
<a id='line_5902'>  Stript off the case, and read the naked shield,</a>
<a id='line_5903'>  Now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_5904'>  Now made a pretty history to herself</a>
<a id='line_5905'>  Of every dint a sword had beaten in it,</a>
<a id='line_5906'>  And every scratch a lance had made upon it,</a>
<a id='line_5907'>  Conjecturing when and where:  this cut is fresh;</a>
<a id='line_5908'>  That ten years back; this dealt him at Caerlyle;</a>
<a id='line_5909'>  That at Caerleon; this at Camelot:</a>
<a id='line_5910'>  And ah God's mercy, what a stroke was there!</a>
<a id='line_5911'>  And here a thrust that might have killed, but God</a>
<a id='line_5912'>  Broke the strong lance, and rolled his enemy down,</a>
<a id='line_5913'>  And saved him:  so she lived in fantasy.</a>
<a id='line_5914'></a>
<a id='line_5915'>     How came the lily maid by that good shield</a>
<a id='line_5916'>  Of Lancelot, she that knew not even his name?</a>
<a id='line_5917'>  He left it with her, when he rode to tilt</a>
<a id='line_5918'>  For the great diamond in the diamond jousts,</a>
<a id='line_5919'>  Which Arthur had ordained, and by that name</a>
<a id='line_5920'>  Had named them, since a diamond was the prize.</a>
<a id='line_5921'></a>
<a id='line_5922'>     For Arthur, long before they crowned him King,</a>
<a id='line_5923'>  Roving the trackless realms of Lyonnesse,</a>
<a id='line_5924'>  Had found a glen, gray boulder and black tarn.</a>
<a id='line_5925'>  A horror lived about the tarn, and clave</a>
<a id='line_5926'>  Like its own mists to all the mountain side:</a>
<a id='line_5927'>  For here two brothers, one a king, had met</a>
<a id='line_5928'>  And fought together; but their names were lost;</a>
<a id='line_5929'>  And each had slain his brother at a blow;</a>
<a id='line_5930'>  And down they fell and made the glen abhorred:</a>
<a id='line_5931'>  And there they lay till all their bones were bleached,</a>
<a id='line_5932'>  And lichened into colour with the crags:</a>
<a id='line_5933'>  And he, that once was king, had on a crown</a>
<a id='line_5934'>  Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside.</a>
<a id='line_5935'>  And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass,</a>
<a id='line_5936'>  All in a misty moonshine, unawares</a>
<a id='line_5937'>  Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull</a>
<a id='line_5938'>  Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown</a>
<a id='line_5939'>  Rolled into light, and turning on its rims</a>
<a id='line_5940'>  Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn:</a>
<a id='line_5941'>  And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught,</a>
<a id='line_5942'>  And set it on his head, and in his heart</a>
<a id='line_5943'>  Heard murmurs, 'Lo, thou likewise shalt be King.'</a>
<a id='line_5944'></a>
<a id='line_5945'>     Thereafter, when a King, he had the gems</a>
<a id='line_5946'>  Plucked from the crown, and showed them to his knights,</a>
<a id='line_5947'>  Saying, 'These jewels, whereupon I chanced</a>
<a id='line_5948'>  Divinely, are the kingdom's, not the King's--</a>
<a id='line_5949'>  For public use:  henceforward let there be,</a>
<a id='line_5950'>  Once every year, a joust for one of these:</a>
<a id='line_5951'>  For so by nine years' proof we needs must learn</a>
<a id='line_5952'>  Which is our mightiest, and ourselves shall grow</a>
<a id='line_5953'>  In use of arms and manhood, till we drive</a>
<a id='line_5954'>  The heathen, who, some say, shall rule the land</a>
<a id='line_5955'>  Hereafter, which God hinder.'  Thus he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_5956'>  And eight years past, eight jousts had been, and still</a>
<a id='line_5957'>  Had Lancelot won the diamond of the year,</a>
<a id='line_5958'>  With purpose to present them to the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_5959'>  When all were won; but meaning all at once</a>
<a id='line_5960'>  To snare her royal fancy with a boon</a>
<a id='line_5961'>  Worth half her realm, had never spoken word.</a>
<a id='line_5962'></a>
<a id='line_5963'>     Now for the central diamond and the last</a>
<a id='line_5964'>  And largest, Arthur, holding then his court</a>
<a id='line_5965'>  Hard on the river nigh the place which now</a>
<a id='line_5966'>  Is this world's hugest, let proclaim a joust</a>
<a id='line_5967'>  At Camelot, and when the time drew nigh</a>
<a id='line_5968'>  Spake (for she had been sick) to Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_5969'>  'Are you so sick, my Queen, you cannot move</a>
<a id='line_5970'>  To these fair jousts?'  'Yea, lord,' she said, 'ye know it.'</a>
<a id='line_5971'>  'Then will ye miss,' he answered, 'the great deeds</a>
<a id='line_5972'>  Of Lancelot, and his prowess in the lists,</a>
<a id='line_5973'>  A sight ye love to look on.'  And the Queen</a>
<a id='line_5974'>  Lifted her eyes, and they dwelt languidly</a>
<a id='line_5975'>  On Lancelot, where he stood beside the King.</a>
<a id='line_5976'>  He thinking that he read her meaning there,</a>
<a id='line_5977'>  'Stay with me, I am sick; my love is more</a>
<a id='line_5978'>  Than many diamonds,' yielded; and a heart</a>
<a id='line_5979'>  Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen</a>
<a id='line_5980'>  (However much he yearned to make complete</a>
<a id='line_5981'>  The tale of diamonds for his destined boon)</a>
<a id='line_5982'>  Urged him to speak against the truth, and say,</a>
<a id='line_5983'>  'Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole,</a>
<a id='line_5984'>  And lets me from the saddle;' and the King</a>
<a id='line_5985'>  Glanced first at him, then her, and went his way.</a>
<a id='line_5986'>  No sooner gone than suddenly she began:</a>
<a id='line_5987'></a>
<a id='line_5988'>     'To blame, my lord Sir Lancelot, much to blame!</a>
<a id='line_5989'>  Why go ye not to these fair jousts? the knights</a>
<a id='line_5990'>  Are half of them our enemies, and the crowd</a>
<a id='line_5991'>  Will murmur, "Lo the shameless ones, who take</a>
<a id='line_5992'>  Their pastime now the trustful King is gone!"'</a>
<a id='line_5993'>  Then Lancelot vext at having lied in vain:</a>
<a id='line_5994'>  'Are ye so wise? ye were not once so wise,</a>
<a id='line_5995'>  My Queen, that summer, when ye loved me first.</a>
<a id='line_5996'>  Then of the crowd ye took no more account</a>
<a id='line_5997'>  Than of the myriad cricket of the mead,</a>
<a id='line_5998'>  When its own voice clings to each blade of grass,</a>
<a id='line_5999'>  And every voice is nothing.  As to knights,</a>
<a id='line_6000'>  Them surely can I silence with all ease.</a>
<a id='line_6001'>  But now my loyal worship is allowed</a>
<a id='line_6002'>  Of all men:  many a bard, without offence,</a>
<a id='line_6003'>  Has linked our names together in his lay,</a>
<a id='line_6004'>  Lancelot, the flower of bravery, Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_6005'>  The pearl of beauty:  and our knights at feast</a>
<a id='line_6006'>  Have pledged us in this union, while the King</a>
<a id='line_6007'>  Would listen smiling.  How then? is there more?</a>
<a id='line_6008'>  Has Arthur spoken aught? or would yourself,</a>
<a id='line_6009'>  Now weary of my service and devoir,</a>
<a id='line_6010'>  Henceforth be truer to your faultless lord?'</a>
<a id='line_6011'></a>
<a id='line_6012'>     She broke into a little scornful laugh:</a>
<a id='line_6013'>  'Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,</a>
<a id='line_6014'>  That passionate perfection, my good lord--</a>
<a id='line_6015'>  But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?</a>
<a id='line_6016'>  He never spake word of reproach to me,</a>
<a id='line_6017'>  He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,</a>
<a id='line_6018'>  He cares not for me:  only here today</a>
<a id='line_6019'>  There gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_6020'>  Some meddling rogue has tampered with him--else</a>
<a id='line_6021'>  Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_6022'>  And swearing men to vows impossible,</a>
<a id='line_6023'>  To make them like himself:  but, friend, to me</a>
<a id='line_6024'>  He is all fault who hath no fault at all:</a>
<a id='line_6025'>  For who loves me must have a touch of earth;</a>
<a id='line_6026'>  The low sun makes the colour:  I am yours,</a>
<a id='line_6027'>  Not Arthur's, as ye know, save by the bond.</a>
<a id='line_6028'>  And therefore hear my words:  go to the jousts:</a>
<a id='line_6029'>  The tiny-trumpeting gnat can break our dream</a>
<a id='line_6030'>  When sweetest; and the vermin voices here</a>
<a id='line_6031'>  May buzz so loud--we scorn them, but they sting.'</a>
<a id='line_6032'></a>
<a id='line_6033'>     Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:</a>
<a id='line_6034'>  'And with what face, after my pretext made,</a>
<a id='line_6035'>  Shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot, I</a>
<a id='line_6036'>  Before a King who honours his own word,</a>
<a id='line_6037'>  As if it were his God's?'</a>
<a id='line_6038'></a>
<a id='line_6039'>                           'Yea,' said the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_6040'>  'A moral child without the craft to rule,</a>
<a id='line_6041'>  Else had he not lost me:  but listen to me,</a>
<a id='line_6042'>  If I must find you wit:  we hear it said</a>
<a id='line_6043'>  That men go down before your spear at a touch,</a>
<a id='line_6044'>  But knowing you are Lancelot; your great name,</a>
<a id='line_6045'>  This conquers:  hide it therefore; go unknown:</a>
<a id='line_6046'>  Win! by this kiss you will:  and our true King</a>
<a id='line_6047'>  Will then allow your pretext, O my knight,</a>
<a id='line_6048'>  As all for glory; for to speak him true,</a>
<a id='line_6049'>  Ye know right well, how meek soe'er he seem,</a>
<a id='line_6050'>  No keener hunter after glory breathes.</a>
<a id='line_6051'>  He loves it in his knights more than himself:</a>
<a id='line_6052'>  They prove to him his work:  win and return.'</a>
<a id='line_6053'></a>
<a id='line_6054'>     Then got Sir Lancelot suddenly to horse,</a>
<a id='line_6055'>  Wroth at himself.  Not willing to be known,</a>
<a id='line_6056'>  He left the barren-beaten thoroughfare,</a>
<a id='line_6057'>  Chose the green path that showed the rarer foot,</a>
<a id='line_6058'>  And there among the solitary downs,</a>
<a id='line_6059'>  Full often lost in fancy, lost his way;</a>
<a id='line_6060'>  Till as he traced a faintly-shadowed track,</a>
<a id='line_6061'>  That all in loops and links among the dales</a>
<a id='line_6062'>  Ran to the Castle of Astolat, he saw</a>
<a id='line_6063'>  Fired from the west, far on a hill, the towers.</a>
<a id='line_6064'>  Thither he made, and blew the gateway horn.</a>
<a id='line_6065'>  Then came an old, dumb, myriad-wrinkled man,</a>
<a id='line_6066'>  Who let him into lodging and disarmed.</a>
<a id='line_6067'>  And Lancelot marvelled at the wordless man;</a>
<a id='line_6068'>  And issuing found the Lord of Astolat</a>
<a id='line_6069'>  With two strong sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_6070'>  Moving to meet him in the castle court;</a>
<a id='line_6071'>  And close behind them stept the lily maid</a>
<a id='line_6072'>  Elaine, his daughter:  mother of the house</a>
<a id='line_6073'>  There was not:  some light jest among them rose</a>
<a id='line_6074'>  With laughter dying down as the great knight</a>
<a id='line_6075'>  Approached them:  then the Lord of Astolat:</a>
<a id='line_6076'>  'Whence comes thou, my guest, and by what name</a>
<a id='line_6077'>  Livest thou between the lips? for by thy state</a>
<a id='line_6078'>  And presence I might guess thee chief of those,</a>
<a id='line_6079'>  After the King, who eat in Arthur's halls.</a>
<a id='line_6080'>  Him have I seen:  the rest, his Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_6081'>  Known as they are, to me they are unknown.'</a>
<a id='line_6082'></a>
<a id='line_6083'>     Then answered Sir Lancelot, the chief of knights:</a>
<a id='line_6084'>  'Known am I, and of Arthur's hall, and known,</a>
<a id='line_6085'>  What I by mere mischance have brought, my shield.</a>
<a id='line_6086'>  But since I go to joust as one unknown</a>
<a id='line_6087'>  At Camelot for the diamond, ask me not,</a>
<a id='line_6088'>  Hereafter ye shall know me--and the shield--</a>
<a id='line_6089'>  I pray you lend me one, if such you have,</a>
<a id='line_6090'>  Blank, or at least with some device not mine.'</a>
<a id='line_6091'></a>
<a id='line_6092'>     Then said the Lord of Astolat, 'Here is Torre's:</a>
<a id='line_6093'>  Hurt in his first tilt was my son, Sir Torre.</a>
<a id='line_6094'>  And so, God wot, his shield is blank enough.</a>
<a id='line_6095'>  His ye can have.'  Then added plain Sir Torre,</a>
<a id='line_6096'>  'Yea, since I cannot use it, ye may have it.'</a>
<a id='line_6097'>  Here laughed the father saying, 'Fie, Sir Churl,</a>
<a id='line_6098'>  Is that answer for a noble knight?</a>
<a id='line_6099'>  Allow him! but Lavaine, my younger here,</a>
<a id='line_6100'>  He is so full of lustihood, he will ride,</a>
<a id='line_6101'>  Joust for it, and win, and bring it in an hour,</a>
<a id='line_6102'>  And set it in this damsel's golden hair,</a>
<a id='line_6103'>  To make her thrice as wilful as before.'</a>
<a id='line_6104'></a>
<a id='line_6105'>     'Nay, father, nay good father, shame me not</a>
<a id='line_6106'>  Before this noble knight,' said young Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_6107'>  'For nothing.  Surely I but played on Torre:</a>
<a id='line_6108'>  He seemed so sullen, vext he could not go:</a>
<a id='line_6109'>  A jest, no more! for, knight, the maiden dreamt</a>
<a id='line_6110'>  That some one put this diamond in her hand,</a>
<a id='line_6111'>  And that it was too slippery to be held,</a>
<a id='line_6112'>  And slipt and fell into some pool or stream,</a>
<a id='line_6113'>  The castle-well, belike; and then I said</a>
<a id='line_6114'>  That if I went and if I fought and won it</a>
<a id='line_6115'>  (But all was jest and joke among ourselves)</a>
<a id='line_6116'>  Then must she keep it safelier.  All was jest.</a>
<a id='line_6117'>  But, father, give me leave, an if he will,</a>
<a id='line_6118'>  To ride to Camelot with this noble knight:</a>
<a id='line_6119'>  Win shall I not, but do my best to win:</a>
<a id='line_6120'>  Young as I am, yet would I do my best.'</a>
<a id='line_6121'></a>
<a id='line_6122'>     'So will ye grace me,' answered Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_6123'>  Smiling a moment, 'with your fellowship</a>
<a id='line_6124'>  O'er these waste downs whereon I lost myself,</a>
<a id='line_6125'>  Then were I glad of you as guide and friend:</a>
<a id='line_6126'>  And you shall win this diamond,--as I hear</a>
<a id='line_6127'>  It is a fair large diamond,--if ye may,</a>
<a id='line_6128'>  And yield it to this maiden, if ye will.'</a>
<a id='line_6129'>  'A fair large diamond,' added plain Sir Torre,</a>
<a id='line_6130'>  'Such be for queens, and not for simple maids.'</a>
<a id='line_6131'>  Then she, who held her eyes upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_6132'>  Elaine, and heard her name so tost about,</a>
<a id='line_6133'>  Flushed slightly at the slight disparagement</a>
<a id='line_6134'>  Before the stranger knight, who, looking at her,</a>
<a id='line_6135'>  Full courtly, yet not falsely, thus returned:</a>
<a id='line_6136'>  'If what is fair be but for what is fair,</a>
<a id='line_6137'>  And only queens are to be counted so,</a>
<a id='line_6138'>  Rash were my judgment then, who deem this maid</a>
<a id='line_6139'>  Might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth,</a>
<a id='line_6140'>  Not violating the bond of like to like.'</a>
<a id='line_6141'></a>
<a id='line_6142'>     He spoke and ceased:  the lily maid Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_6143'>  Won by the mellow voice before she looked,</a>
<a id='line_6144'>  Lifted her eyes, and read his lineaments.</a>
<a id='line_6145'>  The great and guilty love he bare the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_6146'>  In battle with the love he bare his lord,</a>
<a id='line_6147'>  Had marred his face, and marked it ere his time.</a>
<a id='line_6148'>  Another sinning on such heights with one,</a>
<a id='line_6149'>  The flower of all the west and all the world,</a>
<a id='line_6150'>  Had been the sleeker for it:  but in him</a>
<a id='line_6151'>  His mood was often like a fiend, and rose</a>
<a id='line_6152'>  And drove him into wastes and solitudes</a>
<a id='line_6153'>  For agony, who was yet a living soul.</a>
<a id='line_6154'>  Marred as he was, he seemed the goodliest man</a>
<a id='line_6155'>  That ever among ladies ate in hall,</a>
<a id='line_6156'>  And noblest, when she lifted up her eyes.</a>
<a id='line_6157'>  However marred, of more than twice her years,</a>
<a id='line_6158'>  Seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek,</a>
<a id='line_6159'>  And bruised and bronzed, she lifted up her eyes</a>
<a id='line_6160'>  And loved him, with that love which was her doom.</a>
<a id='line_6161'></a>
<a id='line_6162'>     Then the great knight, the darling of the court,</a>
<a id='line_6163'>  Loved of the loveliest, into that rude hall</a>
<a id='line_6164'>  Stept with all grace, and not with half disdain</a>
<a id='line_6165'>  Hid under grace, as in a smaller time,</a>
<a id='line_6166'>  But kindly man moving among his kind:</a>
<a id='line_6167'>  Whom they with meats and vintage of their best</a>
<a id='line_6168'>  And talk and minstrel melody entertained.</a>
<a id='line_6169'>  And much they asked of court and Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_6170'>  And ever well and readily answered he:</a>
<a id='line_6171'>  But Lancelot, when they glanced at Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_6172'>  Suddenly speaking of the wordless man,</a>
<a id='line_6173'>  Heard from the Baron that, ten years before,</a>
<a id='line_6174'>  The heathen caught and reft him of his tongue.</a>
<a id='line_6175'>  'He learnt and warned me of their fierce design</a>
<a id='line_6176'>  Against my house, and him they caught and maimed;</a>
<a id='line_6177'>  But I, my sons, and little daughter fled</a>
<a id='line_6178'>  From bonds or death, and dwelt among the woods</a>
<a id='line_6179'>  By the great river in a boatman's hut.</a>
<a id='line_6180'>  Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke</a>
<a id='line_6181'>  The Pagan yet once more on Badon hill.'</a>
<a id='line_6182'></a>
<a id='line_6183'>     'O there, great lord, doubtless,' Lavaine said, rapt</a>
<a id='line_6184'>  By all the sweet and sudden passion of youth</a>
<a id='line_6185'>  Toward greatness in its elder, 'you have fought.</a>
<a id='line_6186'>  O tell us--for we live apart--you know</a>
<a id='line_6187'>  Of Arthur's glorious wars.'  And Lancelot spoke</a>
<a id='line_6188'>  And answered him at full, as having been</a>
<a id='line_6189'>  With Arthur in the fight which all day long</a>
<a id='line_6190'>  Rang by the white mouth of the violent Glem;</a>
<a id='line_6191'>  And in the four loud battles by the shore</a>
<a id='line_6192'>  Of Duglas; that on Bassa; then the war</a>
<a id='line_6193'>  That thundered in and out the gloomy skirts</a>
<a id='line_6194'>  Of Celidon the forest; and again</a>
<a id='line_6195'>  By castle Gurnion, where the glorious King</a>
<a id='line_6196'>  Had on his cuirass worn our Lady's Head,</a>
<a id='line_6197'>  Carved of one emerald centered in a sun</a>
<a id='line_6198'>  Of silver rays, that lightened as he breathed;</a>
<a id='line_6199'>  And at Caerleon had he helped his lord,</a>
<a id='line_6200'>  When the strong neighings of the wild white Horse</a>
<a id='line_6201'>  Set every gilded parapet shuddering;</a>
<a id='line_6202'>  And up in Agned-Cathregonion too,</a>
<a id='line_6203'>  And down the waste sand-shores of Trath Treroit,</a>
<a id='line_6204'>  Where many a heathen fell; 'and on the mount</a>
<a id='line_6205'>  Of Badon I myself beheld the King</a>
<a id='line_6206'>  Charge at the head of all his Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_6207'>  And all his legions crying Christ and him,</a>
<a id='line_6208'>  And break them; and I saw him, after, stand</a>
<a id='line_6209'>  High on a heap of slain, from spur to plume</a>
<a id='line_6210'>  Red as the rising sun with heathen blood,</a>
<a id='line_6211'>  And seeing me, with a great voice he cried,</a>
<a id='line_6212'>  "They are broken, they are broken!" for the King,</a>
<a id='line_6213'>  However mild he seems at home, nor cares</a>
<a id='line_6214'>  For triumph in our mimic wars, the jousts--</a>
<a id='line_6215'>  For if his own knight cast him down, he laughs</a>
<a id='line_6216'>  Saying, his knights are better men than he--</a>
<a id='line_6217'>  Yet in this heathen war the fire of God</a>
<a id='line_6218'>  Fills him:  I never saw his like:  there lives</a>
<a id='line_6219'>  No greater leader.'</a>
<a id='line_6220'></a>
<a id='line_6221'>                     While he uttered this,</a>
<a id='line_6222'>  Low to her own heart said the lily maid,</a>
<a id='line_6223'>  'Save your own great self, fair lord;' and when he fell</a>
<a id='line_6224'>  From talk of war to traits of pleasantry--</a>
<a id='line_6225'>  Being mirthful he, but in a stately kind--</a>
<a id='line_6226'>  She still took note that when the living smile</a>
<a id='line_6227'>  Died from his lips, across him came a cloud</a>
<a id='line_6228'>  Of melancholy severe, from which again,</a>
<a id='line_6229'>  Whenever in her hovering to and fro</a>
<a id='line_6230'>  The lily maid had striven to make him cheer,</a>
<a id='line_6231'>  There brake a sudden-beaming tenderness</a>
<a id='line_6232'>  Of manners and of nature:  and she thought</a>
<a id='line_6233'>  That all was nature, all, perchance, for her.</a>
<a id='line_6234'>  And all night long his face before her lived,</a>
<a id='line_6235'>  As when a painter, poring on a face,</a>
<a id='line_6236'>  Divinely through all hindrance finds the man</a>
<a id='line_6237'>  Behind it, and so paints him that his face,</a>
<a id='line_6238'>  The shape and colour of a mind and life,</a>
<a id='line_6239'>  Lives for his children, ever at its best</a>
<a id='line_6240'>  And fullest; so the face before her lived,</a>
<a id='line_6241'>  Dark-splendid, speaking in the silence, full</a>
<a id='line_6242'>  Of noble things, and held her from her sleep.</a>
<a id='line_6243'>  Till rathe she rose, half-cheated in the thought</a>
<a id='line_6244'>  She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine.</a>
<a id='line_6245'>  First in fear, step after step, she stole</a>
<a id='line_6246'>  Down the long tower-stairs, hesitating:</a>
<a id='line_6247'>  Anon, she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court,</a>
<a id='line_6248'>  'This shield, my friend, where is it?' and Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_6249'>  Past inward, as she came from out the tower.</a>
<a id='line_6250'>  There to his proud horse Lancelot turned, and smoothed</a>
<a id='line_6251'>  The glossy shoulder, humming to himself.</a>
<a id='line_6252'>  Half-envious of the flattering hand, she drew</a>
<a id='line_6253'>  Nearer and stood.  He looked, and more amazed</a>
<a id='line_6254'>  Than if seven men had set upon him, saw</a>
<a id='line_6255'>  The maiden standing in the dewy light.</a>
<a id='line_6256'>  He had not dreamed she was so beautiful.</a>
<a id='line_6257'>  Then came on him a sort of sacred fear,</a>
<a id='line_6258'>  For silent, though he greeted her, she stood</a>
<a id='line_6259'>  Rapt on his face as if it were a God's.</a>
<a id='line_6260'>  Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire,</a>
<a id='line_6261'>  That he should wear her favour at the tilt.</a>
<a id='line_6262'>  She braved a riotous heart in asking for it.</a>
<a id='line_6263'>  'Fair lord, whose name I know not--noble it is,</a>
<a id='line_6264'>  I well believe, the noblest--will you wear</a>
<a id='line_6265'>  My favour at this tourney?'  'Nay,' said he,</a>
<a id='line_6266'>  'Fair lady, since I never yet have worn</a>
<a id='line_6267'>  Favour of any lady in the lists.</a>
<a id='line_6268'>  Such is my wont, as those, who know me, know.'</a>
<a id='line_6269'>  'Yea, so,' she answered; 'then in wearing mine</a>
<a id='line_6270'>  Needs must be lesser likelihood, noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_6271'>  That those who know should know you.'  And he turned</a>
<a id='line_6272'>  Her counsel up and down within his mind,</a>
<a id='line_6273'>  And found it true, and answered, 'True, my child.</a>
<a id='line_6274'>  Well, I will wear it:  fetch it out to me:</a>
<a id='line_6275'>  What is it?' and she told him 'A red sleeve</a>
<a id='line_6276'>  Broidered with pearls,' and brought it:  then he bound</a>
<a id='line_6277'>  Her token on his helmet, with a smile</a>
<a id='line_6278'>  Saying, 'I never yet have done so much</a>
<a id='line_6279'>  For any maiden living,' and the blood</a>
<a id='line_6280'>  Sprang to her face and filled her with delight;</a>
<a id='line_6281'>  But left her all the paler, when Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_6282'>  Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield,</a>
<a id='line_6283'>  His brother's; which he gave to Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_6284'>  Who parted with his own to fair Elaine:</a>
<a id='line_6285'>  'Do me this grace, my child, to have my shield</a>
<a id='line_6286'>  In keeping till I come.'  'A grace to me,'</a>
<a id='line_6287'>  She answered, 'twice today.  I am your squire!'</a>
<a id='line_6288'>  Whereat Lavaine said, laughing, 'Lily maid,</a>
<a id='line_6289'>  For fear our people call you lily maid</a>
<a id='line_6290'>  In earnest, let me bring your colour back;</a>
<a id='line_6291'>  Once, twice, and thrice:  now get you hence to bed:'</a>
<a id='line_6292'>  So kissed her, and Sir Lancelot his own hand,</a>
<a id='line_6293'>  And thus they moved away:  she stayed a minute,</a>
<a id='line_6294'>  Then made a sudden step to the gate, and there--</a>
<a id='line_6295'>  Her bright hair blown about the serious face</a>
<a id='line_6296'>  Yet rosy-kindled with her brother's kiss--</a>
<a id='line_6297'>  Paused by the gateway, standing near the shield</a>
<a id='line_6298'>  In silence, while she watched their arms far-off</a>
<a id='line_6299'>  Sparkle, until they dipt below the downs.</a>
<a id='line_6300'>  Then to her tower she climbed, and took the shield,</a>
<a id='line_6301'>  There kept it, and so lived in fantasy.</a>
<a id='line_6302'></a>
<a id='line_6303'>     Meanwhile the new companions past away</a>
<a id='line_6304'>  Far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs,</a>
<a id='line_6305'>  To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight</a>
<a id='line_6306'>  Not far from Camelot, now for forty years</a>
<a id='line_6307'>  A hermit, who had prayed, laboured and prayed,</a>
<a id='line_6308'>  And ever labouring had scooped himself</a>
<a id='line_6309'>  In the white rock a chapel and a hall</a>
<a id='line_6310'>  On massive columns, like a shorecliff cave,</a>
<a id='line_6311'>  And cells and chambers:  all were fair and dry;</a>
<a id='line_6312'>  The green light from the meadows underneath</a>
<a id='line_6313'>  Struck up and lived along the milky roofs;</a>
<a id='line_6314'>  And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees</a>
<a id='line_6315'>  And poplars made a noise of falling showers.</a>
<a id='line_6316'>  And thither wending there that night they bode.</a>
<a id='line_6317'></a>
<a id='line_6318'>     But when the next day broke from underground,</a>
<a id='line_6319'>  And shot red fire and shadows through the cave,</a>
<a id='line_6320'>  They rose, heard mass, broke fast, and rode away:</a>
<a id='line_6321'>  Then Lancelot saying, 'Hear, but hold my name</a>
<a id='line_6322'>  Hidden, you ride with Lancelot of the Lake,'</a>
<a id='line_6323'>  Abashed young Lavaine, whose instant reverence,</a>
<a id='line_6324'>  Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise,</a>
<a id='line_6325'>  But left him leave to stammer, 'Is it indeed?'</a>
<a id='line_6326'>  And after muttering 'The great Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_6327'>  At last he got his breath and answered, 'One,</a>
<a id='line_6328'>  One have I seen--that other, our liege lord,</a>
<a id='line_6329'>  The dread Pendragon, Britain's King of kings,</a>
<a id='line_6330'>  Of whom the people talk mysteriously,</a>
<a id='line_6331'>  He will be there--then were I stricken blind</a>
<a id='line_6332'>  That minute, I might say that I had seen.'</a>
<a id='line_6333'></a>
<a id='line_6334'>     So spake Lavaine, and when they reached the lists</a>
<a id='line_6335'>  By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes</a>
<a id='line_6336'>  Run through the peopled gallery which half round</a>
<a id='line_6337'>  Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass,</a>
<a id='line_6338'>  Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat</a>
<a id='line_6339'>  Robed in red samite, easily to be known,</a>
<a id='line_6340'>  Since to his crown the golden dragon clung,</a>
<a id='line_6341'>  And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold,</a>
<a id='line_6342'>  And from the carven-work behind him crept</a>
<a id='line_6343'>  Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make</a>
<a id='line_6344'>  Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them</a>
<a id='line_6345'>  Through knots and loops and folds innumerable</a>
<a id='line_6346'>  Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found</a>
<a id='line_6347'>  The new design wherein they lost themselves,</a>
<a id='line_6348'>  Yet with all ease, so tender was the work:</a>
<a id='line_6349'>  And, in the costly canopy o'er him set,</a>
<a id='line_6350'>  Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.</a>
<a id='line_6351'></a>
<a id='line_6352'>     Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said,</a>
<a id='line_6353'>  'Me you call great:  mine is the firmer seat,</a>
<a id='line_6354'>  The truer lance:  but there is many a youth</a>
<a id='line_6355'>  Now crescent, who will come to all I am</a>
<a id='line_6356'>  And overcome it; and in me there dwells</a>
<a id='line_6357'>  No greatness, save it be some far-off touch</a>
<a id='line_6358'>  Of greatness to know well I am not great:</a>
<a id='line_6359'>  There is the man.'  And Lavaine gaped upon him</a>
<a id='line_6360'>  As on a thing miraculous, and anon</a>
<a id='line_6361'>  The trumpets blew; and then did either side,</a>
<a id='line_6362'>  They that assailed, and they that held the lists,</a>
<a id='line_6363'>  Set lance in rest, strike spur, suddenly move,</a>
<a id='line_6364'>  Meet in the midst, and there so furiously</a>
<a id='line_6365'>  Shock, that a man far-off might well perceive,</a>
<a id='line_6366'>  If any man that day were left afield,</a>
<a id='line_6367'>  The hard earth shake, and a low thunder of arms.</a>
<a id='line_6368'>  And Lancelot bode a little, till he saw</a>
<a id='line_6369'>  Which were the weaker; then he hurled into it</a>
<a id='line_6370'>  Against the stronger:  little need to speak</a>
<a id='line_6371'>  Of Lancelot in his glory!  King, duke, earl,</a>
<a id='line_6372'>  Count, baron--whom he smote, he overthrew.</a>
<a id='line_6373'></a>
<a id='line_6374'>     But in the field were Lancelot's kith and kin,</a>
<a id='line_6375'>  Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists,</a>
<a id='line_6376'>  Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger knight</a>
<a id='line_6377'>  Should do and almost overdo the deeds</a>
<a id='line_6378'>  Of Lancelot; and one said to the other, 'Lo!</a>
<a id='line_6379'>  What is he?  I do not mean the force alone--</a>
<a id='line_6380'>  The grace and versatility of the man!</a>
<a id='line_6381'>  Is it not Lancelot?'  'When has Lancelot worn</a>
<a id='line_6382'>  Favour of any lady in the lists?</a>
<a id='line_6383'>  Not such his wont, as we, that know him, know.'</a>
<a id='line_6384'>  'How then? who then?' a fury seized them all,</a>
<a id='line_6385'>  A fiery family passion for the name</a>
<a id='line_6386'>  Of Lancelot, and a glory one with theirs.</a>
<a id='line_6387'>  They couched their spears and pricked their steeds, and thus,</a>
<a id='line_6388'>  Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made</a>
<a id='line_6389'>  In moving, all together down upon him</a>
<a id='line_6390'>  Bare, as a wild wave in the wide North-sea,</a>
<a id='line_6391'>  Green-glimmering toward the summit, bears, with all</a>
<a id='line_6392'>  Its stormy crests that smoke against the skies,</a>
<a id='line_6393'>  Down on a bark, and overbears the bark,</a>
<a id='line_6394'>  And him that helms it, so they overbore</a>
<a id='line_6395'>  Sir Lancelot and his charger, and a spear</a>
<a id='line_6396'>  Down-glancing lamed the charger, and a spear</a>
<a id='line_6397'>  Pricked sharply his own cuirass, and the head</a>
<a id='line_6398'>  Pierced through his side, and there snapt, and remained.</a>
<a id='line_6399'></a>
<a id='line_6400'>     Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully;</a>
<a id='line_6401'>  He bore a knight of old repute to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_6402'>  And brought his horse to Lancelot where he lay.</a>
<a id='line_6403'>  He up the side, sweating with agony, got,</a>
<a id='line_6404'>  But thought to do while he might yet endure,</a>
<a id='line_6405'>  And being lustily holpen by the rest,</a>
<a id='line_6406'>  His party,--though it seemed half-miracle</a>
<a id='line_6407'>  To those he fought with,--drave his kith and kin,</a>
<a id='line_6408'>  And all the Table Round that held the lists,</a>
<a id='line_6409'>  Back to the barrier; then the trumpets blew</a>
<a id='line_6410'>  Proclaiming his the prize, who wore the sleeve</a>
<a id='line_6411'>  Of scarlet, and the pearls; and all the knights,</a>
<a id='line_6412'>  His party, cried 'Advance and take thy prize</a>
<a id='line_6413'>  The diamond;' but he answered, 'Diamond me</a>
<a id='line_6414'>  No diamonds! for God's love, a little air!</a>
<a id='line_6415'>  Prize me no prizes, for my prize is death!</a>
<a id='line_6416'>  Hence will I, and I charge you, follow me not.'</a>
<a id='line_6417'></a>
<a id='line_6418'>     He spoke, and vanished suddenly from the field</a>
<a id='line_6419'>  With young Lavaine into the poplar grove.</a>
<a id='line_6420'>  There from his charger down he slid, and sat,</a>
<a id='line_6421'>  Gasping to Sir Lavaine, 'Draw the lance-head:'</a>
<a id='line_6422'>  'Ah my sweet lord Sir Lancelot,' said Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_6423'>  'I dread me, if I draw it, you will die.'</a>
<a id='line_6424'>  But he, 'I die already with it:  draw--</a>
<a id='line_6425'>  Draw,'--and Lavaine drew, and Sir Lancelot gave</a>
<a id='line_6426'>  A marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan,</a>
<a id='line_6427'>  And half his blood burst forth, and down he sank</a>
<a id='line_6428'>  For the pure pain, and wholly swooned away.</a>
<a id='line_6429'>  Then came the hermit out and bare him in,</a>
<a id='line_6430'>  There stanched his wound; and there, in daily doubt</a>
<a id='line_6431'>  Whether to live or die, for many a week</a>
<a id='line_6432'>  Hid from the wide world's rumour by the grove</a>
<a id='line_6433'>  Of poplars with their noise of falling showers,</a>
<a id='line_6434'>  And ever-tremulous aspen-trees, he lay.</a>
<a id='line_6435'></a>
<a id='line_6436'>     But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists,</a>
<a id='line_6437'>  His party, knights of utmost North and West,</a>
<a id='line_6438'>  Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate isles,</a>
<a id='line_6439'>  Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him,</a>
<a id='line_6440'>  'Lo, Sire, our knight, through whom we won the day,</a>
<a id='line_6441'>  Hath gone sore wounded, and hath left his prize</a>
<a id='line_6442'>  Untaken, crying that his prize is death.'</a>
<a id='line_6443'>  'Heaven hinder,' said the King, 'that such an one,</a>
<a id='line_6444'>  So great a knight as we have seen today--</a>
<a id='line_6445'>  He seemed to me another Lancelot--</a>
<a id='line_6446'>  Yea, twenty times I thought him Lancelot--</a>
<a id='line_6447'>  He must not pass uncared for.  Wherefore, rise,</a>
<a id='line_6448'>  O Gawain, and ride forth and find the knight.</a>
<a id='line_6449'>  Wounded and wearied needs must he be near.</a>
<a id='line_6450'>  I charge you that you get at once to horse.</a>
<a id='line_6451'>  And, knights and kings, there breathes not one of you</a>
<a id='line_6452'>  Will deem this prize of ours is rashly given:</a>
<a id='line_6453'>  His prowess was too wondrous.  We will do him</a>
<a id='line_6454'>  No customary honour:  since the knight</a>
<a id='line_6455'>  Came not to us, of us to claim the prize,</a>
<a id='line_6456'>  Ourselves will send it after.  Rise and take</a>
<a id='line_6457'>  This diamond, and deliver it, and return,</a>
<a id='line_6458'>  And bring us where he is, and how he fares,</a>
<a id='line_6459'>  And cease not from your quest until ye find.'</a>
<a id='line_6460'></a>
<a id='line_6461'>     So saying, from the carven flower above,</a>
<a id='line_6462'>  To which it made a restless heart, he took,</a>
<a id='line_6463'>  And gave, the diamond:  then from where he sat</a>
<a id='line_6464'>  At Arthur's right, with smiling face arose,</a>
<a id='line_6465'>  With smiling face and frowning heart, a Prince</a>
<a id='line_6466'>  In the mid might and flourish of his May,</a>
<a id='line_6467'>  Gawain, surnamed The Courteous, fair and strong,</a>
<a id='line_6468'>  And after Lancelot, Tristram, and Geraint</a>
<a id='line_6469'>  And Gareth, a good knight, but therewithal</a>
<a id='line_6470'>  Sir Modred's brother, and the child of Lot,</a>
<a id='line_6471'>  Nor often loyal to his word, and now</a>
<a id='line_6472'>  Wroth that the King's command to sally forth</a>
<a id='line_6473'>  In quest of whom he knew not, made him leave</a>
<a id='line_6474'>  The banquet, and concourse of knights and kings.</a>
<a id='line_6475'></a>
<a id='line_6476'>     So all in wrath he got to horse and went;</a>
<a id='line_6477'>  While Arthur to the banquet, dark in mood,</a>
<a id='line_6478'>  Past, thinking 'Is it Lancelot who hath come</a>
<a id='line_6479'>  Despite the wound he spake of, all for gain</a>
<a id='line_6480'>  Of glory, and hath added wound to wound,</a>
<a id='line_6481'>  And ridden away to die?'  So feared the King,</a>
<a id='line_6482'>  And, after two days' tarriance there, returned.</a>
<a id='line_6483'>  Then when he saw the Queen, embracing asked,</a>
<a id='line_6484'>  'Love, are you yet so sick?'  'Nay, lord,' she said.</a>
<a id='line_6485'>  'And where is Lancelot?'  Then the Queen amazed,</a>
<a id='line_6486'>  'Was he not with you? won he not your prize?'</a>
<a id='line_6487'>  'Nay, but one like him.'  'Why that like was he.'</a>
<a id='line_6488'>  And when the King demanded how she knew,</a>
<a id='line_6489'>  Said, 'Lord, no sooner had ye parted from us,</a>
<a id='line_6490'>  Than Lancelot told me of a common talk</a>
<a id='line_6491'>  That men went down before his spear at a touch,</a>
<a id='line_6492'>  But knowing he was Lancelot; his great name</a>
<a id='line_6493'>  Conquered; and therefore would he hide his name</a>
<a id='line_6494'>  From all men, even the King, and to this end</a>
<a id='line_6495'>  Had made a pretext of a hindering wound,</a>
<a id='line_6496'>  That he might joust unknown of all, and learn</a>
<a id='line_6497'>  If his old prowess were in aught decayed;</a>
<a id='line_6498'>  And added, "Our true Arthur, when he learns,</a>
<a id='line_6499'>  Will well allow me pretext, as for gain</a>
<a id='line_6500'>  Of purer glory."'</a>
<a id='line_6501'></a>
<a id='line_6502'>                   Then replied the King:</a>
<a id='line_6503'>  'Far lovelier in our Lancelot had it been,</a>
<a id='line_6504'>  In lieu of idly dallying with the truth,</a>
<a id='line_6505'>  To have trusted me as he hath trusted thee.</a>
<a id='line_6506'>  Surely his King and most familiar friend</a>
<a id='line_6507'>  Might well have kept his secret.  True, indeed,</a>
<a id='line_6508'>  Albeit I know my knights fantastical,</a>
<a id='line_6509'>  So fine a fear in our large Lancelot</a>
<a id='line_6510'>  Must needs have moved my laughter:  now remains</a>
<a id='line_6511'>  But little cause for laughter:  his own kin--</a>
<a id='line_6512'>  Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!--</a>
<a id='line_6513'>  His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;</a>
<a id='line_6514'>  So that he went sore wounded from the field:</a>
<a id='line_6515'>  Yet good news too:  for goodly hopes are mine</a>
<a id='line_6516'>  That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart.</a>
<a id='line_6517'>  He wore, against his wont, upon his helm</a>
<a id='line_6518'>  A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,</a>
<a id='line_6519'>  Some gentle maiden's gift.'</a>
<a id='line_6520'></a>
<a id='line_6521'>                             'Yea, lord,' she said,</a>
<a id='line_6522'>  'Thy hopes are mine,' and saying that, she choked,</a>
<a id='line_6523'>  And sharply turned about to hide her face,</a>
<a id='line_6524'>  Past to her chamber, and there flung herself</a>
<a id='line_6525'>  Down on the great King's couch, and writhed upon it,</a>
<a id='line_6526'>  And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,</a>
<a id='line_6527'>  And shrieked out 'Traitor' to the unhearing wall,</a>
<a id='line_6528'>  Then flashed into wild tears, and rose again,</a>
<a id='line_6529'>  And moved about her palace, proud and pale.</a>
<a id='line_6530'></a>
<a id='line_6531'>     Gawain the while through all the region round</a>
<a id='line_6532'>  Rode with his diamond, wearied of the quest,</a>
<a id='line_6533'>  Touched at all points, except the poplar grove,</a>
<a id='line_6534'>  And came at last, though late, to Astolat:</a>
<a id='line_6535'>  Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid</a>
<a id='line_6536'>  Glanced at, and cried, 'What news from Camelot, lord?</a>
<a id='line_6537'>  What of the knight with the red sleeve?'  'He won.'</a>
<a id='line_6538'>  'I knew it,' she said.  'But parted from the jousts</a>
<a id='line_6539'>  Hurt in the side,' whereat she caught her breath;</a>
<a id='line_6540'>  Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go;</a>
<a id='line_6541'>  Thereon she smote her hand:  wellnigh she swooned:</a>
<a id='line_6542'>  And, while he gazed wonderingly at her, came</a>
<a id='line_6543'>  The Lord of Astolat out, to whom the Prince</a>
<a id='line_6544'>  Reported who he was, and on what quest</a>
<a id='line_6545'>  Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find</a>
<a id='line_6546'>  The victor, but had ridden a random round</a>
<a id='line_6547'>  To seek him, and had wearied of the search.</a>
<a id='line_6548'>  To whom the Lord of Astolat, 'Bide with us,</a>
<a id='line_6549'>  And ride no more at random, noble Prince!</a>
<a id='line_6550'>  Here was the knight, and here he left a shield;</a>
<a id='line_6551'>  This will he send or come for:  furthermore</a>
<a id='line_6552'>  Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,</a>
<a id='line_6553'>  Needs must hear.'  To this the courteous Prince</a>
<a id='line_6554'>  Accorded with his wonted courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_6555'>  Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,</a>
<a id='line_6556'>  And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:</a>
<a id='line_6557'>  Where could be found face daintier? then her shape</a>
<a id='line_6558'>  From forehead down to foot, perfect--again</a>
<a id='line_6559'>  From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:</a>
<a id='line_6560'>  'Well--if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!'</a>
<a id='line_6561'>  And oft they met among the garden yews,</a>
<a id='line_6562'>  And there he set himself to play upon her</a>
<a id='line_6563'>  With sallying wit, free flashes from a height</a>
<a id='line_6564'>  Above her, graces of the court, and songs,</a>
<a id='line_6565'>  Sighs, and slow smiles, and golden eloquence</a>
<a id='line_6566'>  And amorous adulation, till the maid</a>
<a id='line_6567'>  Rebelled against it, saying to him, 'Prince,</a>
<a id='line_6568'>  O loyal nephew of our noble King,</a>
<a id='line_6569'>  Why ask you not to see the shield he left,</a>
<a id='line_6570'>  Whence you might learn his name?  Why slight your King,</a>
<a id='line_6571'>  And lose the quest he sent you on, and prove</a>
<a id='line_6572'>  No surer than our falcon yesterday,</a>
<a id='line_6573'>  Who lost the hern we slipt her at, and went</a>
<a id='line_6574'>  To all the winds?'  'Nay, by mine head,' said he,</a>
<a id='line_6575'>  'I lose it, as we lose the lark in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_6576'>  O damsel, in the light of your blue eyes;</a>
<a id='line_6577'>  But an ye will it let me see the shield.'</a>
<a id='line_6578'>  And when the shield was brought, and Gawain saw</a>
<a id='line_6579'>  Sir Lancelot's azure lions, crowned with gold,</a>
<a id='line_6580'>  Ramp in the field, he smote his thigh, and mocked:</a>
<a id='line_6581'>  'Right was the King! our Lancelot! that true man!'</a>
<a id='line_6582'>  'And right was I,' she answered merrily, 'I,</a>
<a id='line_6583'>  Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all.'</a>
<a id='line_6584'>  'And if I dreamed,' said Gawain, 'that you love</a>
<a id='line_6585'>  This greatest knight, your pardon! lo, ye know it!</a>
<a id='line_6586'>  Speak therefore:  shall I waste myself in vain?'</a>
<a id='line_6587'>  Full simple was her answer, 'What know I?</a>
<a id='line_6588'>  My brethren have been all my fellowship;</a>
<a id='line_6589'>  And I, when often they have talked of love,</a>
<a id='line_6590'>  Wished it had been my mother, for they talked,</a>
<a id='line_6591'>  Meseemed, of what they knew not; so myself--</a>
<a id='line_6592'>  I know not if I know what true love is,</a>
<a id='line_6593'>  But if I know, then, if I love not him,</a>
<a id='line_6594'>  I know there is none other I can love.'</a>
<a id='line_6595'>  'Yea, by God's death,' said he, 'ye love him well,</a>
<a id='line_6596'>  But would not, knew ye what all others know,</a>
<a id='line_6597'>  And whom he loves.'  'So be it,' cried Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_6598'>  And lifted her fair face and moved away:</a>
<a id='line_6599'>  But he pursued her, calling, 'Stay a little!</a>
<a id='line_6600'>  One golden minute's grace! he wore your sleeve:</a>
<a id='line_6601'>  Would he break faith with one I may not name?</a>
<a id='line_6602'>  Must our true man change like a leaf at last?</a>
<a id='line_6603'>  Nay--like enow:  why then, far be it from me</a>
<a id='line_6604'>  To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves!</a>
<a id='line_6605'>  And, damsel, for I deem you know full well</a>
<a id='line_6606'>  Where your great knight is hidden, let me leave</a>
<a id='line_6607'>  My quest with you; the diamond also:  here!</a>
<a id='line_6608'>  For if you love, it will be sweet to give it;</a>
<a id='line_6609'>  And if he love, it will be sweet to have it</a>
<a id='line_6610'>  From your own hand; and whether he love or not,</a>
<a id='line_6611'>  A diamond is a diamond.  Fare you well</a>
<a id='line_6612'>  A thousand times!--a thousand times farewell!</a>
<a id='line_6613'>  Yet, if he love, and his love hold, we two</a>
<a id='line_6614'>  May meet at court hereafter:  there, I think,</a>
<a id='line_6615'>  So ye will learn the courtesies of the court,</a>
<a id='line_6616'>  We two shall know each other.'</a>
<a id='line_6617'></a>
<a id='line_6618'>                                Then he gave,</a>
<a id='line_6619'>  And slightly kissed the hand to which he gave,</a>
<a id='line_6620'>  The diamond, and all wearied of the quest</a>
<a id='line_6621'>  Leapt on his horse, and carolling as he went</a>
<a id='line_6622'>  A true-love ballad, lightly rode away.</a>
<a id='line_6623'></a>
<a id='line_6624'>     Thence to the court he past; there told the King</a>
<a id='line_6625'>  What the King knew, 'Sir Lancelot is the knight.'</a>
<a id='line_6626'>  And added, 'Sire, my liege, so much I learnt;</a>
<a id='line_6627'>  But failed to find him, though I rode all round</a>
<a id='line_6628'>  The region:  but I lighted on the maid</a>
<a id='line_6629'>  Whose sleeve he wore; she loves him; and to her,</a>
<a id='line_6630'>  Deeming our courtesy is the truest law,</a>
<a id='line_6631'>  I gave the diamond:  she will render it;</a>
<a id='line_6632'>  For by mine head she knows his hiding-place.'</a>
<a id='line_6633'></a>
<a id='line_6634'>     The seldom-frowning King frowned, and replied,</a>
<a id='line_6635'>  'Too courteous truly! ye shall go no more</a>
<a id='line_6636'>  On quest of mine, seeing that ye forget</a>
<a id='line_6637'>  Obedience is the courtesy due to kings.'</a>
<a id='line_6638'></a>
<a id='line_6639'>     He spake and parted.  Wroth, but all in awe,</a>
<a id='line_6640'>  For twenty strokes of the blood, without a word,</a>
<a id='line_6641'>  Lingered that other, staring after him;</a>
<a id='line_6642'>  Then shook his hair, strode off, and buzzed abroad</a>
<a id='line_6643'>  About the maid of Astolat, and her love.</a>
<a id='line_6644'>  All ears were pricked at once, all tongues were loosed:</a>
<a id='line_6645'>  'The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_6646'>  Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat.'</a>
<a id='line_6647'>  Some read the King's face, some the Queen's, and all</a>
<a id='line_6648'>  Had marvel what the maid might be, but most</a>
<a id='line_6649'>  Predoomed her as unworthy.  One old dame</a>
<a id='line_6650'>  Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news.</a>
<a id='line_6651'>  She, that had heard the noise of it before,</a>
<a id='line_6652'>  But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low,</a>
<a id='line_6653'>  Marred her friend's aim with pale tranquillity.</a>
<a id='line_6654'>  So ran the tale like fire about the court,</a>
<a id='line_6655'>  Fire in dry stubble a nine-days' wonder flared:</a>
<a id='line_6656'>  Till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice</a>
<a id='line_6657'>  Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_6658'>  And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid</a>
<a id='line_6659'>  Smiled at each other, while the Queen, who sat</a>
<a id='line_6660'>  With lips severely placid, felt the knot</a>
<a id='line_6661'>  Climb in her throat, and with her feet unseen</a>
<a id='line_6662'>  Crushed the wild passion out against the floor</a>
<a id='line_6663'>  Beneath the banquet, where all the meats became</a>
<a id='line_6664'>  As wormwood, and she hated all who pledged.</a>
<a id='line_6665'></a>
<a id='line_6666'>     But far away the maid in Astolat,</a>
<a id='line_6667'>  Her guiltless rival, she that ever kept</a>
<a id='line_6668'>  The one-day-seen Sir Lancelot in her heart,</a>
<a id='line_6669'>  Crept to her father, while he mused alone,</a>
<a id='line_6670'>  Sat on his knee, stroked his gray face and said,</a>
<a id='line_6671'>  'Father, you call me wilful, and the fault</a>
<a id='line_6672'>  Is yours who let me have my will, and now,</a>
<a id='line_6673'>  Sweet father, will you let me lose my wits?'</a>
<a id='line_6674'>  'Nay,' said he, 'surely.'  'Wherefore, let me hence,'</a>
<a id='line_6675'>  She answered, 'and find out our dear Lavaine.'</a>
<a id='line_6676'>  'Ye will not lose your wits for dear Lavaine:</a>
<a id='line_6677'>  Bide,' answered he:  'we needs must hear anon</a>
<a id='line_6678'>  Of him, and of that other.'  'Ay,' she said,</a>
<a id='line_6679'>  'And of that other, for I needs must hence</a>
<a id='line_6680'>  And find that other, wheresoe'er he be,</a>
<a id='line_6681'>  And with mine own hand give his diamond to him,</a>
<a id='line_6682'>  Lest I be found as faithless in the quest</a>
<a id='line_6683'>  As yon proud Prince who left the quest to me.</a>
<a id='line_6684'>  Sweet father, I behold him in my dreams</a>
<a id='line_6685'>  Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,</a>
<a id='line_6686'>  Death-pale, for lack of gentle maiden's aid.</a>
<a id='line_6687'>  The gentler-born the maiden, the more bound,</a>
<a id='line_6688'>  My father, to be sweet and serviceable</a>
<a id='line_6689'>  To noble knights in sickness, as ye know</a>
<a id='line_6690'>  When these have worn their tokens:  let me hence</a>
<a id='line_6691'>  I pray you.'  Then her father nodding said,</a>
<a id='line_6692'>  'Ay, ay, the diamond:  wit ye well, my child,</a>
<a id='line_6693'>  Right fain were I to learn this knight were whole,</a>
<a id='line_6694'>  Being our greatest:  yea, and you must give it--</a>
<a id='line_6695'>  And sure I think this fruit is hung too high</a>
<a id='line_6696'>  For any mouth to gape for save a queen's--</a>
<a id='line_6697'>  Nay, I mean nothing:  so then, get you gone,</a>
<a id='line_6698'>  Being so very wilful you must go.'</a>
<a id='line_6699'></a>
<a id='line_6700'>     Lightly, her suit allowed, she slipt away,</a>
<a id='line_6701'>  And while she made her ready for her ride,</a>
<a id='line_6702'>  Her father's latest word hummed in her ear,</a>
<a id='line_6703'>  'Being so very wilful you must go,'</a>
<a id='line_6704'>  And changed itself and echoed in her heart,</a>
<a id='line_6705'>  'Being so very wilful you must die.'</a>
<a id='line_6706'>  But she was happy enough and shook it off,</a>
<a id='line_6707'>  As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us;</a>
<a id='line_6708'>  And in her heart she answered it and said,</a>
<a id='line_6709'>  'What matter, so I help him back to life?'</a>
<a id='line_6710'>  Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide</a>
<a id='line_6711'>  Rode o'er the long backs of the bushless downs</a>
<a id='line_6712'>  To Camelot, and before the city-gates</a>
<a id='line_6713'>  Came on her brother with a happy face</a>
<a id='line_6714'>  Making a roan horse caper and curvet</a>
<a id='line_6715'>  For pleasure all about a field of flowers:</a>
<a id='line_6716'>  Whom when she saw, 'Lavaine,' she cried, 'Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_6717'>  How fares my lord Sir Lancelot?'  He amazed,</a>
<a id='line_6718'>  'Torre and Elaine! why here? Sir Lancelot!</a>
<a id='line_6719'>  How know ye my lord's name is Lancelot?'</a>
<a id='line_6720'>  But when the maid had told him all her tale,</a>
<a id='line_6721'>  Then turned Sir Torre, and being in his moods</a>
<a id='line_6722'>  Left them, and under the strange-statued gate,</a>
<a id='line_6723'>  Where Arthur's wars were rendered mystically,</a>
<a id='line_6724'>  Past up the still rich city to his kin,</a>
<a id='line_6725'>  His own far blood, which dwelt at Camelot;</a>
<a id='line_6726'>  And her, Lavaine across the poplar grove</a>
<a id='line_6727'>  Led to the caves:  there first she saw the casque</a>
<a id='line_6728'>  Of Lancelot on the wall:  her scarlet sleeve,</a>
<a id='line_6729'>  Though carved and cut, and half the pearls away,</a>
<a id='line_6730'>  Streamed from it still; and in her heart she laughed,</a>
<a id='line_6731'>  Because he had not loosed it from his helm,</a>
<a id='line_6732'>  But meant once more perchance to tourney in it.</a>
<a id='line_6733'>  And when they gained the cell wherein he slept,</a>
<a id='line_6734'>  His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands</a>
<a id='line_6735'>  Lay naked on the wolfskin, and a dream</a>
<a id='line_6736'>  Of dragging down his enemy made them move.</a>
<a id='line_6737'>  Then she that saw him lying unsleek, unshorn,</a>
<a id='line_6738'>  Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,</a>
<a id='line_6739'>  Uttered a little tender dolorous cry.</a>
<a id='line_6740'>  The sound not wonted in a place so still</a>
<a id='line_6741'>  Woke the sick knight, and while he rolled his eyes</a>
<a id='line_6742'>  Yet blank from sleep, she started to him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_6743'>  'Your prize the diamond sent you by the King:'</a>
<a id='line_6744'>  His eyes glistened:  she fancied 'Is it for me?'</a>
<a id='line_6745'>  And when the maid had told him all the tale</a>
<a id='line_6746'>  Of King and Prince, the diamond sent, the quest</a>
<a id='line_6747'>  Assigned to her not worthy of it, she knelt</a>
<a id='line_6748'>  Full lowly by the corners of his bed,</a>
<a id='line_6749'>  And laid the diamond in his open hand.</a>
<a id='line_6750'>  Her face was near, and as we kiss the child</a>
<a id='line_6751'>  That does the task assigned, he kissed her face.</a>
<a id='line_6752'>  At once she slipt like water to the floor.</a>
<a id='line_6753'>  'Alas,' he said, 'your ride hath wearied you.</a>
<a id='line_6754'>  Rest must you have.'  'No rest for me,' she said;</a>
<a id='line_6755'>  'Nay, for near you, fair lord, I am at rest.'</a>
<a id='line_6756'>  What might she mean by that? his large black eyes,</a>
<a id='line_6757'>  Yet larger through his leanness, dwelt upon her,</a>
<a id='line_6758'>  Till all her heart's sad secret blazed itself</a>
<a id='line_6759'>  In the heart's colours on her simple face;</a>
<a id='line_6760'>  And Lancelot looked and was perplext in mind,</a>
<a id='line_6761'>  And being weak in body said no more;</a>
<a id='line_6762'>  But did not love the colour; woman's love,</a>
<a id='line_6763'>  Save one, he not regarded, and so turned</a>
<a id='line_6764'>  Sighing, and feigned a sleep until he slept.</a>
<a id='line_6765'></a>
<a id='line_6766'>     Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,</a>
<a id='line_6767'>  And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates</a>
<a id='line_6768'>  Far up the dim rich city to her kin;</a>
<a id='line_6769'>  There bode the night:  but woke with dawn, and past</a>
<a id='line_6770'>  Down through the dim rich city to the fields,</a>
<a id='line_6771'>  Thence to the cave:  so day by day she past</a>
<a id='line_6772'>  In either twilight ghost-like to and fro</a>
<a id='line_6773'>  Gliding, and every day she tended him,</a>
<a id='line_6774'>  And likewise many a night:  and Lancelot</a>
<a id='line_6775'>  Would, though he called his wound a little hurt</a>
<a id='line_6776'>  Whereof he should be quickly whole, at times</a>
<a id='line_6777'>  Brain-feverous in his heat and agony, seem</a>
<a id='line_6778'>  Uncourteous, even he:  but the meek maid</a>
<a id='line_6779'>  Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him</a>
<a id='line_6780'>  Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,</a>
<a id='line_6781'>  Milder than any mother to a sick child,</a>
<a id='line_6782'>  And never woman yet, since man's first fall,</a>
<a id='line_6783'>  Did kindlier unto man, but her deep love</a>
<a id='line_6784'>  Upbore her; till the hermit, skilled in all</a>
<a id='line_6785'>  The simples and the science of that time,</a>
<a id='line_6786'>  Told him that her fine care had saved his life.</a>
<a id='line_6787'>  And the sick man forgot her simple blush,</a>
<a id='line_6788'>  Would call her friend and sister, sweet Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_6789'>  Would listen for her coming and regret</a>
<a id='line_6790'>  Her parting step, and held her tenderly,</a>
<a id='line_6791'>  And loved her with all love except the love</a>
<a id='line_6792'>  Of man and woman when they love their best,</a>
<a id='line_6793'>  Closest and sweetest, and had died the death</a>
<a id='line_6794'>  In any knightly fashion for her sake.</a>
<a id='line_6795'>  And peradventure had he seen her first</a>
<a id='line_6796'>  She might have made this and that other world</a>
<a id='line_6797'>  Another world for the sick man; but now</a>
<a id='line_6798'>  The shackles of an old love straitened him,</a>
<a id='line_6799'>  His honour rooted in dishonour stood,</a>
<a id='line_6800'>  And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.</a>
<a id='line_6801'></a>
<a id='line_6802'>     Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made</a>
<a id='line_6803'>  Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.</a>
<a id='line_6804'>  These, as but born of sickness, could not live:</a>
<a id='line_6805'>  For when the blood ran lustier in him again,</a>
<a id='line_6806'>  Full often the bright image of one face,</a>
<a id='line_6807'>  Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,</a>
<a id='line_6808'>  Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.</a>
<a id='line_6809'>  Then if the maiden, while that ghostly grace</a>
<a id='line_6810'>  Beamed on his fancy, spoke, he answered not,</a>
<a id='line_6811'>  Or short and coldly, and she knew right well</a>
<a id='line_6812'>  What the rough sickness meant, but what this meant</a>
<a id='line_6813'>  She knew not, and the sorrow dimmed her sight,</a>
<a id='line_6814'>  And drave her ere her time across the fields</a>
<a id='line_6815'>  Far into the rich city, where alone</a>
<a id='line_6816'>  She murmured, 'Vain, in vain:  it cannot be.</a>
<a id='line_6817'>  He will not love me:  how then? must I die?'</a>
<a id='line_6818'>  Then as a little helpless innocent bird,</a>
<a id='line_6819'>  That has but one plain passage of few notes,</a>
<a id='line_6820'>  Will sing the simple passage o'er and o'er</a>
<a id='line_6821'>  For all an April morning, till the ear</a>
<a id='line_6822'>  Wearies to hear it, so the simple maid</a>
<a id='line_6823'>  Went half the night repeating, 'Must I die?'</a>
<a id='line_6824'>  And now to right she turned, and now to left,</a>
<a id='line_6825'>  And found no ease in turning or in rest;</a>
<a id='line_6826'>  And 'Him or death,' she muttered, 'death or him,'</a>
<a id='line_6827'>  Again and like a burthen, 'Him or death.'</a>
<a id='line_6828'></a>
<a id='line_6829'>     But when Sir Lancelot's deadly hurt was whole,</a>
<a id='line_6830'>  To Astolat returning rode the three.</a>
<a id='line_6831'>  There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self</a>
<a id='line_6832'>  In that wherein she deemed she looked her best,</a>
<a id='line_6833'>  She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought</a>
<a id='line_6834'>  'If I be loved, these are my festal robes,</a>
<a id='line_6835'>  If not, the victim's flowers before he fall.'</a>
<a id='line_6836'>  And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid</a>
<a id='line_6837'>  That she should ask some goodly gift of him</a>
<a id='line_6838'>  For her own self or hers; 'and do not shun</a>
<a id='line_6839'>  To speak the wish most near to your true heart;</a>
<a id='line_6840'>  Such service have ye done me, that I make</a>
<a id='line_6841'>  My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I</a>
<a id='line_6842'>  In mine own land, and what I will I can.'</a>
<a id='line_6843'>  Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,</a>
<a id='line_6844'>  But like a ghost without the power to speak.</a>
<a id='line_6845'>  And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,</a>
<a id='line_6846'>  And bode among them yet a little space</a>
<a id='line_6847'>  Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced</a>
<a id='line_6848'>  He found her in among the garden yews,</a>
<a id='line_6849'>  And said, 'Delay no longer, speak your wish,</a>
<a id='line_6850'>  Seeing I go today:' then out she brake:</a>
<a id='line_6851'>  'Going? and we shall never see you more.</a>
<a id='line_6852'>  And I must die for want of one bold word.'</a>
<a id='line_6853'>  'Speak:  that I live to hear,' he said, 'is yours.'</a>
<a id='line_6854'>  Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:</a>
<a id='line_6855'>  'I have gone mad.  I love you:  let me die.'</a>
<a id='line_6856'>  'Ah, sister,' answered Lancelot, 'what is this?'</a>
<a id='line_6857'>  And innocently extending her white arms,</a>
<a id='line_6858'>  'Your love,' she said, 'your love--to be your wife.'</a>
<a id='line_6859'>  And Lancelot answered, 'Had I chosen to wed,</a>
<a id='line_6860'>  I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:</a>
<a id='line_6861'>  But now there never will be wife of mine.'</a>
<a id='line_6862'>  'No, no,' she cried, 'I care not to be wife,</a>
<a id='line_6863'>  But to be with you still, to see your face,</a>
<a id='line_6864'>  To serve you, and to follow you through the world.'</a>
<a id='line_6865'>  And Lancelot answered, 'Nay, the world, the world,</a>
<a id='line_6866'>  All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart</a>
<a id='line_6867'>  To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue</a>
<a id='line_6868'>  To blare its own interpretation--nay,</a>
<a id='line_6869'>  Full ill then should I quit your brother's love,</a>
<a id='line_6870'>  And your good father's kindness.'  And she said,</a>
<a id='line_6871'>  'Not to be with you, not to see your face--</a>
<a id='line_6872'>  Alas for me then, my good days are done.'</a>
<a id='line_6873'>  'Nay, noble maid,' he answered, 'ten times nay!</a>
<a id='line_6874'>  This is not love:  but love's first flash in youth,</a>
<a id='line_6875'>  Most common:  yea, I know it of mine own self:</a>
<a id='line_6876'>  And you yourself will smile at your own self</a>
<a id='line_6877'>  Hereafter, when you yield your flower of life</a>
<a id='line_6878'>  To one more fitly yours, not thrice your age:</a>
<a id='line_6879'>  And then will I, for true you are and sweet</a>
<a id='line_6880'>  Beyond mine old belief in womanhood,</a>
<a id='line_6881'>  More specially should your good knight be poor,</a>
<a id='line_6882'>  Endow you with broad land and territory</a>
<a id='line_6883'>  Even to the half my realm beyond the seas,</a>
<a id='line_6884'>  So that would make you happy:  furthermore,</a>
<a id='line_6885'>  Even to the death, as though ye were my blood,</a>
<a id='line_6886'>  In all your quarrels will I be your knight.</a>
<a id='line_6887'>  This I will do, dear damsel, for your sake,</a>
<a id='line_6888'>  And more than this I cannot.'</a>
<a id='line_6889'></a>
<a id='line_6890'>                               While he spoke</a>
<a id='line_6891'>  She neither blushed nor shook, but deathly-pale</a>
<a id='line_6892'>  Stood grasping what was nearest, then replied:</a>
<a id='line_6893'>  'Of all this will I nothing;' and so fell,</a>
<a id='line_6894'>  And thus they bore her swooning to her tower.</a>
<a id='line_6895'></a>
<a id='line_6896'>     Then spake, to whom through those black walls of yew</a>
<a id='line_6897'>  Their talk had pierced, her father:  'Ay, a flash,</a>
<a id='line_6898'>  I fear me, that will strike my blossom dead.</a>
<a id='line_6899'>  Too courteous are ye, fair Lord Lancelot.</a>
<a id='line_6900'>  I pray you, use some rough discourtesy</a>
<a id='line_6901'>  To blunt or break her passion.'</a>
<a id='line_6902'></a>
<a id='line_6903'>                                 Lancelot said,</a>
<a id='line_6904'>  'That were against me:  what I can I will;'</a>
<a id='line_6905'>  And there that day remained, and toward even</a>
<a id='line_6906'>  Sent for his shield:  full meekly rose the maid,</a>
<a id='line_6907'>  Stript off the case, and gave the naked shield;</a>
<a id='line_6908'>  Then, when she heard his horse upon the stones,</a>
<a id='line_6909'>  Unclasping flung the casement back, and looked</a>
<a id='line_6910'>  Down on his helm, from which her sleeve had gone.</a>
<a id='line_6911'>  And Lancelot knew the little clinking sound;</a>
<a id='line_6912'>  And she by tact of love was well aware</a>
<a id='line_6913'>  That Lancelot knew that she was looking at him.</a>
<a id='line_6914'>  And yet he glanced not up, nor waved his hand,</a>
<a id='line_6915'>  Nor bad farewell, but sadly rode away.</a>
<a id='line_6916'>  This was the one discourtesy that he used.</a>
<a id='line_6917'></a>
<a id='line_6918'>     So in her tower alone the maiden sat:</a>
<a id='line_6919'>  His very shield was gone; only the case,</a>
<a id='line_6920'>  Her own poor work, her empty labour, left.</a>
<a id='line_6921'>  But still she heard him, still his picture formed</a>
<a id='line_6922'>  And grew between her and the pictured wall.</a>
<a id='line_6923'>  Then came her father, saying in low tones,</a>
<a id='line_6924'>  'Have comfort,' whom she greeted quietly.</a>
<a id='line_6925'>  Then came her brethren saying, 'Peace to thee,</a>
<a id='line_6926'>  Sweet sister,' whom she answered with all calm.</a>
<a id='line_6927'>  But when they left her to herself again,</a>
<a id='line_6928'>  Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field</a>
<a id='line_6929'>  Approaching through the darkness, called; the owls</a>
<a id='line_6930'>  Wailing had power upon her, and she mixt</a>
<a id='line_6931'>  Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms</a>
<a id='line_6932'>  Of evening, and the moanings of the wind.</a>
<a id='line_6933'></a>
<a id='line_6934'>     And in those days she made a little song,</a>
<a id='line_6935'>  And called her song 'The Song of Love and Death,'</a>
<a id='line_6936'>  And sang it:  sweetly could she make and sing.</a>
<a id='line_6937'></a>
<a id='line_6938'>     'Sweet is true love though given in vain, in vain;</a>
<a id='line_6939'>  And sweet is death who puts an end to pain:</a>
<a id='line_6940'>  I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</a>
<a id='line_6941'></a>
<a id='line_6942'>     'Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:</a>
<a id='line_6943'>  Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.</a>
<a id='line_6944'>  O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.</a>
<a id='line_6945'></a>
<a id='line_6946'>     'Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,</a>
<a id='line_6947'>  Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,</a>
<a id='line_6948'>  I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</a>
<a id='line_6949'></a>
<a id='line_6950'>     'I fain would follow love, if that could be;</a>
<a id='line_6951'>  I needs must follow death, who calls for me;</a>
<a id='line_6952'>  Call and I follow, I follow! let me die.'</a>
<a id='line_6953'></a>
<a id='line_6954'>     High with the last line scaled her voice, and this,</a>
<a id='line_6955'>  All in a fiery dawning wild with wind</a>
<a id='line_6956'>  That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and thought</a>
<a id='line_6957'>  With shuddering, 'Hark the Phantom of the house</a>
<a id='line_6958'>  That ever shrieks before a death,' and called</a>
<a id='line_6959'>  The father, and all three in hurry and fear</a>
<a id='line_6960'>  Ran to her, and lo! the blood-red light of dawn</a>
<a id='line_6961'>  Flared on her face, she shrilling, 'Let me die!'</a>
<a id='line_6962'></a>
<a id='line_6963'>     As when we dwell upon a word we know,</a>
<a id='line_6964'>  Repeating, till the word we know so well</a>
<a id='line_6965'>  Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,</a>
<a id='line_6966'>  So dwelt the father on her face, and thought</a>
<a id='line_6967'>  'Is this Elaine?' till back the maiden fell,</a>
<a id='line_6968'>  Then gave a languid hand to each, and lay,</a>
<a id='line_6969'>  Speaking a still good-morrow with her eyes.</a>
<a id='line_6970'>  At last she said, 'Sweet brothers, yesternight</a>
<a id='line_6971'>  I seemed a curious little maid again,</a>
<a id='line_6972'>  As happy as when we dwelt among the woods,</a>
<a id='line_6973'>  And when ye used to take me with the flood</a>
<a id='line_6974'>  Up the great river in the boatman's boat.</a>
<a id='line_6975'>  Only ye would not pass beyond the cape</a>
<a id='line_6976'>  That has the poplar on it:  there ye fixt</a>
<a id='line_6977'>  Your limit, oft returning with the tide.</a>
<a id='line_6978'>  And yet I cried because ye would not pass</a>
<a id='line_6979'>  Beyond it, and far up the shining flood</a>
<a id='line_6980'>  Until we found the palace of the King.</a>
<a id='line_6981'>  And yet ye would not; but this night I dreamed</a>
<a id='line_6982'>  That I was all alone upon the flood,</a>
<a id='line_6983'>  And then I said, "Now shall I have my will:"</a>
<a id='line_6984'>  And there I woke, but still the wish remained.</a>
<a id='line_6985'>  So let me hence that I may pass at last</a>
<a id='line_6986'>  Beyond the poplar and far up the flood,</a>
<a id='line_6987'>  Until I find the palace of the King.</a>
<a id='line_6988'>  There will I enter in among them all,</a>
<a id='line_6989'>  And no man there will dare to mock at me;</a>
<a id='line_6990'>  But there the fine Gawain will wonder at me,</a>
<a id='line_6991'>  And there the great Sir Lancelot muse at me;</a>
<a id='line_6992'>  Gawain, who bad a thousand farewells to me,</a>
<a id='line_6993'>  Lancelot, who coldly went, nor bad me one:</a>
<a id='line_6994'>  And there the King will know me and my love,</a>
<a id='line_6995'>  And there the Queen herself will pity me,</a>
<a id='line_6996'>  And all the gentle court will welcome me,</a>
<a id='line_6997'>  And after my long voyage I shall rest!'</a>
<a id='line_6998'></a>
<a id='line_6999'>     'Peace,' said her father, 'O my child, ye seem</a>
<a id='line_7000'>  Light-headed, for what force is yours to go</a>
<a id='line_7001'>  So far, being sick? and wherefore would ye look</a>
<a id='line_7002'>  On this proud fellow again, who scorns us all?'</a>
<a id='line_7003'></a>
<a id='line_7004'>     Then the rough Torre began to heave and move,</a>
<a id='line_7005'>  And bluster into stormy sobs and say,</a>
<a id='line_7006'>  'I never loved him:  an I meet with him,</a>
<a id='line_7007'>  I care not howsoever great he be,</a>
<a id='line_7008'>  Then will I strike at him and strike him down,</a>
<a id='line_7009'>  Give me good fortune, I will strike him dead,</a>
<a id='line_7010'>  For this discomfort he hath done the house.'</a>
<a id='line_7011'></a>
<a id='line_7012'>     To whom the gentle sister made reply,</a>
<a id='line_7013'>  'Fret not yourself, dear brother, nor be wroth,</a>
<a id='line_7014'>  Seeing it is no more Sir Lancelot's fault</a>
<a id='line_7015'>  Not to love me, than it is mine to love</a>
<a id='line_7016'>  Him of all men who seems to me the highest.'</a>
<a id='line_7017'></a>
<a id='line_7018'>     'Highest?' the father answered, echoing 'highest?'</a>
<a id='line_7019'>  (He meant to break the passion in her) 'nay,</a>
<a id='line_7020'>  Daughter, I know not what you call the highest;</a>
<a id='line_7021'>  But this I know, for all the people know it,</a>
<a id='line_7022'>  He loves the Queen, and in an open shame:</a>
<a id='line_7023'>  And she returns his love in open shame;</a>
<a id='line_7024'>  If this be high, what is it to be low?'</a>
<a id='line_7025'></a>
<a id='line_7026'>     Then spake the lily maid of Astolat:</a>
<a id='line_7027'>  'Sweet father, all too faint and sick am I</a>
<a id='line_7028'>  For anger:  these are slanders:  never yet</a>
<a id='line_7029'>  Was noble man but made ignoble talk.</a>
<a id='line_7030'>  He makes no friend who never made a foe.</a>
<a id='line_7031'>  But now it is my glory to have loved</a>
<a id='line_7032'>  One peerless, without stain:  so let me pass,</a>
<a id='line_7033'>  My father, howsoe'er I seem to you,</a>
<a id='line_7034'>  Not all unhappy, having loved God's best</a>
<a id='line_7035'>  And greatest, though my love had no return:</a>
<a id='line_7036'>  Yet, seeing you desire your child to live,</a>
<a id='line_7037'>  Thanks, but you work against your own desire;</a>
<a id='line_7038'>  For if I could believe the things you say</a>
<a id='line_7039'>  I should but die the sooner; wherefore cease,</a>
<a id='line_7040'>  Sweet father, and bid call the ghostly man</a>
<a id='line_7041'>  Hither, and let me shrive me clean, and die.'</a>
<a id='line_7042'></a>
<a id='line_7043'>     So when the ghostly man had come and gone,</a>
<a id='line_7044'>  She with a face, bright as for sin forgiven,</a>
<a id='line_7045'>  Besought Lavaine to write as she devised</a>
<a id='line_7046'>  A letter, word for word; and when he asked</a>
<a id='line_7047'>  'Is it for Lancelot, is it for my dear lord?</a>
<a id='line_7048'>  Then will I bear it gladly;' she replied,</a>
<a id='line_7049'>  'For Lancelot and the Queen and all the world,</a>
<a id='line_7050'>  But I myself must bear it.'  Then he wrote</a>
<a id='line_7051'>  The letter she devised; which being writ</a>
<a id='line_7052'>  And folded, 'O sweet father, tender and true,</a>
<a id='line_7053'>  Deny me not,' she said--'ye never yet</a>
<a id='line_7054'>  Denied my fancies--this, however strange,</a>
<a id='line_7055'>  My latest:  lay the letter in my hand</a>
<a id='line_7056'>  A little ere I die, and close the hand</a>
<a id='line_7057'>  Upon it; I shall guard it even in death.</a>
<a id='line_7058'>  And when the heat is gone from out my heart,</a>
<a id='line_7059'>  Then take the little bed on which I died</a>
<a id='line_7060'>  For Lancelot's love, and deck it like the Queen's</a>
<a id='line_7061'>  For richness, and me also like the Queen</a>
<a id='line_7062'>  In all I have of rich, and lay me on it.</a>
<a id='line_7063'>  And let there be prepared a chariot-bier</a>
<a id='line_7064'>  To take me to the river, and a barge</a>
<a id='line_7065'>  Be ready on the river, clothed in black.</a>
<a id='line_7066'>  I go in state to court, to meet the Queen.</a>
<a id='line_7067'>  There surely I shall speak for mine own self,</a>
<a id='line_7068'>  And none of you can speak for me so well.</a>
<a id='line_7069'>  And therefore let our dumb old man alone</a>
<a id='line_7070'>  Go with me, he can steer and row, and he</a>
<a id='line_7071'>  Will guide me to that palace, to the doors.'</a>
<a id='line_7072'></a>
<a id='line_7073'>     She ceased:  her father promised; whereupon</a>
<a id='line_7074'>  She grew so cheerful that they deemed her death</a>
<a id='line_7075'>  Was rather in the fantasy than the blood.</a>
<a id='line_7076'>  But ten slow mornings past, and on the eleventh</a>
<a id='line_7077'>  Her father laid the letter in her hand,</a>
<a id='line_7078'>  And closed the hand upon it, and she died.</a>
<a id='line_7079'>  So that day there was dole in Astolat.</a>
<a id='line_7080'></a>
<a id='line_7081'>     But when the next sun brake from underground,</a>
<a id='line_7082'>  Then, those two brethren slowly with bent brows</a>
<a id='line_7083'>  Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier</a>
<a id='line_7084'>  Past like a shadow through the field, that shone</a>
<a id='line_7085'>  Full-summer, to that stream whereon the barge,</a>
<a id='line_7086'>  Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.</a>
<a id='line_7087'>  There sat the lifelong creature of the house,</a>
<a id='line_7088'>  Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,</a>
<a id='line_7089'>  Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.</a>
<a id='line_7090'>  So those two brethren from the chariot took</a>
<a id='line_7091'>  And on the black decks laid her in her bed,</a>
<a id='line_7092'>  Set in her hand a lily, o'er her hung</a>
<a id='line_7093'>  The silken case with braided blazonings,</a>
<a id='line_7094'>  And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her</a>
<a id='line_7095'>  'Sister, farewell for ever,' and again</a>
<a id='line_7096'>  'Farewell, sweet sister,' parted all in tears.</a>
<a id='line_7097'>  Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,</a>
<a id='line_7098'>  Oared by the dumb, went upward with the flood--</a>
<a id='line_7099'>  In her right hand the lily, in her left</a>
<a id='line_7100'>  The letter--all her bright hair streaming down--</a>
<a id='line_7101'>  And all the coverlid was cloth of gold</a>
<a id='line_7102'>  Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white</a>
<a id='line_7103'>  All but her face, and that clear-featured face</a>
<a id='line_7104'>  Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,</a>
<a id='line_7105'>  But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled.</a>
<a id='line_7106'></a>
<a id='line_7107'>     That day Sir Lancelot at the palace craved</a>
<a id='line_7108'>  Audience of Guinevere, to give at last,</a>
<a id='line_7109'>  The price of half a realm, his costly gift,</a>
<a id='line_7110'>  Hard-won and hardly won with bruise and blow,</a>
<a id='line_7111'>  With deaths of others, and almost his own,</a>
<a id='line_7112'>  The nine-years-fought-for diamonds:  for he saw</a>
<a id='line_7113'>  One of her house, and sent him to the Queen</a>
<a id='line_7114'>  Bearing his wish, whereto the Queen agreed</a>
<a id='line_7115'>  With such and so unmoved a majesty</a>
<a id='line_7116'>  She might have seemed her statue, but that he,</a>
<a id='line_7117'>  Low-drooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet</a>
<a id='line_7118'>  For loyal awe, saw with a sidelong eye</a>
<a id='line_7119'>  The shadow of some piece of pointed lace,</a>
<a id='line_7120'>  In the Queen's shadow, vibrate on the walls,</a>
<a id='line_7121'>  And parted, laughing in his courtly heart.</a>
<a id='line_7122'></a>
<a id='line_7123'>     All in an oriel on the summer side,</a>
<a id='line_7124'>  Vine-clad, of Arthur's palace toward the stream,</a>
<a id='line_7125'>  They met, and Lancelot kneeling uttered, 'Queen,</a>
<a id='line_7126'>  Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,</a>
<a id='line_7127'>  Take, what I had not won except for you,</a>
<a id='line_7128'>  These jewels, and make me happy, making them</a>
<a id='line_7129'>  An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,</a>
<a id='line_7130'>  Or necklace for a neck to which the swan's</a>
<a id='line_7131'>  Is tawnier than her cygnet's:  these are words:</a>
<a id='line_7132'>  Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin</a>
<a id='line_7133'>  In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it</a>
<a id='line_7134'>  Words, as we grant grief tears.  Such sin in words</a>
<a id='line_7135'>  Perchance, we both can pardon:  but, my Queen,</a>
<a id='line_7136'>  I hear of rumours flying through your court.</a>
<a id='line_7137'>  Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,</a>
<a id='line_7138'>  Should have in it an absoluter trust</a>
<a id='line_7139'>  To make up that defect:  let rumours be:</a>
<a id='line_7140'>  When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust</a>
<a id='line_7141'>  That you trust me in your own nobleness,</a>
<a id='line_7142'>  I may not well believe that you believe.'</a>
<a id='line_7143'></a>
<a id='line_7144'>     While thus he spoke, half turned away, the Queen</a>
<a id='line_7145'>  Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine</a>
<a id='line_7146'>  Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,</a>
<a id='line_7147'>  Till all the place whereon she stood was green;</a>
<a id='line_7148'>  Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand</a>
<a id='line_7149'>  Received at once and laid aside the gems</a>
<a id='line_7150'>  There on a table near her, and replied:</a>
<a id='line_7151'></a>
<a id='line_7152'>     'It may be, I am quicker of belief</a>
<a id='line_7153'>  Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.</a>
<a id='line_7154'>  Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.</a>
<a id='line_7155'>  This good is in it, whatsoe'er of ill,</a>
<a id='line_7156'>  It can be broken easier.  I for you</a>
<a id='line_7157'>  This many a year have done despite and wrong</a>
<a id='line_7158'>  To one whom ever in my heart of hearts</a>
<a id='line_7159'>  I did acknowledge nobler.  What are these?</a>
<a id='line_7160'>  Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth</a>
<a id='line_7161'>  Being your gift, had you not lost your own.</a>
<a id='line_7162'>  To loyal hearts the value of all gifts</a>
<a id='line_7163'>  Must vary as the giver's.  Not for me!</a>
<a id='line_7164'>  For her! for your new fancy.  Only this</a>
<a id='line_7165'>  Grant me, I pray you:  have your joys apart.</a>
<a id='line_7166'>  I doubt not that however changed, you keep</a>
<a id='line_7167'>  So much of what is graceful:  and myself</a>
<a id='line_7168'>  Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy</a>
<a id='line_7169'>  In which as Arthur's Queen I move and rule:</a>
<a id='line_7170'>  So cannot speak my mind.  An end to this!</a>
<a id='line_7171'>  A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.</a>
<a id='line_7172'>  So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;</a>
<a id='line_7173'>  Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:</a>
<a id='line_7174'>  An armlet for an arm to which the Queen's</a>
<a id='line_7175'>  Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck</a>
<a id='line_7176'>  O as much fairer--as a faith once fair</a>
<a id='line_7177'>  Was richer than these diamonds--hers not mine--</a>
<a id='line_7178'>  Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself,</a>
<a id='line_7179'>  Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will--</a>
<a id='line_7180'>  She shall not have them.'</a>
<a id='line_7181'></a>
<a id='line_7182'>                           Saying which she seized,</a>
<a id='line_7183'>  And, through the casement standing wide for heat,</a>
<a id='line_7184'>  Flung them, and down they flashed, and smote the stream.</a>
<a id='line_7185'>  Then from the smitten surface flashed, as it were,</a>
<a id='line_7186'>  Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.</a>
<a id='line_7187'>  Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain</a>
<a id='line_7188'>  At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,</a>
<a id='line_7189'>  Close underneath his eyes, and right across</a>
<a id='line_7190'>  Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge.</a>
<a id='line_7191'>  Whereon the lily maid of Astolat</a>
<a id='line_7192'>  Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.</a>
<a id='line_7193'></a>
<a id='line_7194'>     But the wild Queen, who saw not, burst away</a>
<a id='line_7195'>  To weep and wail in secret; and the barge,</a>
<a id='line_7196'>  On to the palace-doorway sliding, paused.</a>
<a id='line_7197'>  There two stood armed, and kept the door; to whom,</a>
<a id='line_7198'>  All up the marble stair, tier over tier,</a>
<a id='line_7199'>  Were added mouths that gaped, and eyes that asked</a>
<a id='line_7200'>  'What is it?' but that oarsman's haggard face,</a>
<a id='line_7201'>  As hard and still as is the face that men</a>
<a id='line_7202'>  Shape to their fancy's eye from broken rocks</a>
<a id='line_7203'>  On some cliff-side, appalled them, and they said</a>
<a id='line_7204'>  'He is enchanted, cannot speak--and she,</a>
<a id='line_7205'>  Look how she sleeps--the Fairy Queen, so fair!</a>
<a id='line_7206'>  Yea, but how pale! what are they? flesh and blood?</a>
<a id='line_7207'>  Or come to take the King to Fairyland?</a>
<a id='line_7208'>  For some do hold our Arthur cannot die,</a>
<a id='line_7209'>  But that he passes into Fairyland.'</a>
<a id='line_7210'></a>
<a id='line_7211'>     While thus they babbled of the King, the King</a>
<a id='line_7212'>  Came girt with knights:  then turned the tongueless man</a>
<a id='line_7213'>  From the half-face to the full eye, and rose</a>
<a id='line_7214'>  And pointed to the damsel, and the doors.</a>
<a id='line_7215'>  So Arthur bad the meek Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_7216'>  And pure Sir Galahad to uplift the maid;</a>
<a id='line_7217'>  And reverently they bore her into hall.</a>
<a id='line_7218'>  Then came the fine Gawain and wondered at her,</a>
<a id='line_7219'>  And Lancelot later came and mused at her,</a>
<a id='line_7220'>  And last the Queen herself, and pitied her:</a>
<a id='line_7221'>  But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,</a>
<a id='line_7222'>  Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:</a>
<a id='line_7223'></a>
<a id='line_7224'>     'Most noble lord, Sir Lancelot of the Lake,</a>
<a id='line_7225'>  I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,</a>
<a id='line_7226'>  Come, for you left me taking no farewell,</a>
<a id='line_7227'>  Hither, to take my last farewell of you.</a>
<a id='line_7228'>  I loved you, and my love had no return,</a>
<a id='line_7229'>  And therefore my true love has been my death.</a>
<a id='line_7230'>  And therefore to our Lady Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_7231'>  And to all other ladies, I make moan:</a>
<a id='line_7232'>  Pray for my soul, and yield me burial.</a>
<a id='line_7233'>  Pray for my soul thou too, Sir Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_7234'>  As thou art a knight peerless.'</a>
<a id='line_7235'></a>
<a id='line_7236'>                                 Thus he read;</a>
<a id='line_7237'>  And ever in the reading, lords and dames</a>
<a id='line_7238'>  Wept, looking often from his face who read</a>
<a id='line_7239'>  To hers which lay so silent, and at times,</a>
<a id='line_7240'>  So touched were they, half-thinking that her lips,</a>
<a id='line_7241'>  Who had devised the letter, moved again.</a>
<a id='line_7242'></a>
<a id='line_7243'>     Then freely spoke Sir Lancelot to them all:</a>
<a id='line_7244'>  'My lord liege Arthur, and all ye that hear,</a>
<a id='line_7245'>  Know that for this most gentle maiden's death</a>
<a id='line_7246'>  Right heavy am I; for good she was and true,</a>
<a id='line_7247'>  But loved me with a love beyond all love</a>
<a id='line_7248'>  In women, whomsoever I have known.</a>
<a id='line_7249'>  Yet to be loved makes not to love again;</a>
<a id='line_7250'>  Not at my years, however it hold in youth.</a>
<a id='line_7251'>  I swear by truth and knighthood that I gave</a>
<a id='line_7252'>  No cause, not willingly, for such a love:</a>
<a id='line_7253'>  To this I call my friends in testimony,</a>
<a id='line_7254'>  Her brethren, and her father, who himself</a>
<a id='line_7255'>  Besought me to be plain and blunt, and use,</a>
<a id='line_7256'>  To break her passion, some discourtesy</a>
<a id='line_7257'>  Against my nature:  what I could, I did.</a>
<a id='line_7258'>  I left her and I bad her no farewell;</a>
<a id='line_7259'>  Though, had I dreamt the damsel would have died,</a>
<a id='line_7260'>  I might have put my wits to some rough use,</a>
<a id='line_7261'>  And helped her from herself.'</a>
<a id='line_7262'></a>
<a id='line_7263'>                               Then said the Queen</a>
<a id='line_7264'>  (Sea was her wrath, yet working after storm)</a>
<a id='line_7265'>  'Ye might at least have done her so much grace,</a>
<a id='line_7266'>  Fair lord, as would have helped her from her death.'</a>
<a id='line_7267'>  He raised his head, their eyes met and hers fell,</a>
<a id='line_7268'>  He adding,</a>
<a id='line_7269'>            'Queen, she would not be content</a>
<a id='line_7270'>  Save that I wedded her, which could not be.</a>
<a id='line_7271'>  Then might she follow me through the world, she asked;</a>
<a id='line_7272'>  It could not be.  I told her that her love</a>
<a id='line_7273'>  Was but the flash of youth, would darken down</a>
<a id='line_7274'>  To rise hereafter in a stiller flame</a>
<a id='line_7275'>  Toward one more worthy of her--then would I,</a>
<a id='line_7276'>  More specially were he, she wedded, poor,</a>
<a id='line_7277'>  Estate them with large land and territory</a>
<a id='line_7278'>  In mine own realm beyond the narrow seas,</a>
<a id='line_7279'>  To keep them in all joyance:  more than this</a>
<a id='line_7280'>  I could not; this she would not, and she died.'</a>
<a id='line_7281'></a>
<a id='line_7282'>     He pausing, Arthur answered, 'O my knight,</a>
<a id='line_7283'>  It will be to thy worship, as my knight,</a>
<a id='line_7284'>  And mine, as head of all our Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_7285'>  To see that she be buried worshipfully.'</a>
<a id='line_7286'></a>
<a id='line_7287'>     So toward that shrine which then in all the realm</a>
<a id='line_7288'>  Was richest, Arthur leading, slowly went</a>
<a id='line_7289'>  The marshalled Order of their Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_7290'>  And Lancelot sad beyond his wont, to see</a>
<a id='line_7291'>  The maiden buried, not as one unknown,</a>
<a id='line_7292'>  Nor meanly, but with gorgeous obsequies,</a>
<a id='line_7293'>  And mass, and rolling music, like a queen.</a>
<a id='line_7294'>  And when the knights had laid her comely head</a>
<a id='line_7295'>  Low in the dust of half-forgotten kings,</a>
<a id='line_7296'>  Then Arthur spake among them, 'Let her tomb</a>
<a id='line_7297'>  Be costly, and her image thereupon,</a>
<a id='line_7298'>  And let the shield of Lancelot at her feet</a>
<a id='line_7299'>  Be carven, and her lily in her hand.</a>
<a id='line_7300'>  And let the story of her dolorous voyage</a>
<a id='line_7301'>  For all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb</a>
<a id='line_7302'>  In letters gold and azure!' which was wrought</a>
<a id='line_7303'>  Thereafter; but when now the lords and dames</a>
<a id='line_7304'>  And people, from the high door streaming, brake</a>
<a id='line_7305'>  Disorderly, as homeward each, the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_7306'>  Who marked Sir Lancelot where he moved apart,</a>
<a id='line_7307'>  Drew near, and sighed in passing, 'Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_7308'>  Forgive me; mine was jealousy in love.'</a>
<a id='line_7309'>  He answered with his eyes upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_7310'>  'That is love's curse; pass on, my Queen, forgiven.'</a>
<a id='line_7311'>  But Arthur, who beheld his cloudy brows,</a>
<a id='line_7312'>  Approached him, and with full affection said,</a>
<a id='line_7313'></a>
<a id='line_7314'>     'Lancelot, my Lancelot, thou in whom I have</a>
<a id='line_7315'>  Most joy and most affiance, for I know</a>
<a id='line_7316'>  What thou hast been in battle by my side,</a>
<a id='line_7317'>  And many a time have watched thee at the tilt</a>
<a id='line_7318'>  Strike down the lusty and long practised knight,</a>
<a id='line_7319'>  And let the younger and unskilled go by</a>
<a id='line_7320'>  To win his honour and to make his name,</a>
<a id='line_7321'>  And loved thy courtesies and thee, a man</a>
<a id='line_7322'>  Made to be loved; but now I would to God,</a>
<a id='line_7323'>  Seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_7324'>  Thou couldst have loved this maiden, shaped, it seems,</a>
<a id='line_7325'>  By God for thee alone, and from her face,</a>
<a id='line_7326'>  If one may judge the living by the dead,</a>
<a id='line_7327'>  Delicately pure and marvellously fair,</a>
<a id='line_7328'>  Who might have brought thee, now a lonely man</a>
<a id='line_7329'>  Wifeless and heirless, noble issue, sons</a>
<a id='line_7330'>  Born to the glory of thine name and fame,</a>
<a id='line_7331'>  My knight, the great Sir Lancelot of the Lake.'</a>
<a id='line_7332'></a>
<a id='line_7333'>     Then answered Lancelot, 'Fair she was, my King,</a>
<a id='line_7334'>  Pure, as you ever wish your knights to be.</a>
<a id='line_7335'>  To doubt her fairness were to want an eye,</a>
<a id='line_7336'>  To doubt her pureness were to want a heart--</a>
<a id='line_7337'>  Yea, to be loved, if what is worthy love</a>
<a id='line_7338'>  Could bind him, but free love will not be bound.'</a>
<a id='line_7339'></a>
<a id='line_7340'>     'Free love, so bound, were freest,' said the King.</a>
<a id='line_7341'>  'Let love be free; free love is for the best:</a>
<a id='line_7342'>  And, after heaven, on our dull side of death,</a>
<a id='line_7343'>  What should be best, if not so pure a love</a>
<a id='line_7344'>  Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee</a>
<a id='line_7345'>  She failed to bind, though being, as I think,</a>
<a id='line_7346'>  Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know.'</a>
<a id='line_7347'></a>
<a id='line_7348'>     And Lancelot answered nothing, but he went,</a>
<a id='line_7349'>  And at the inrunning of a little brook</a>
<a id='line_7350'>  Sat by the river in a cove, and watched</a>
<a id='line_7351'>  The high reed wave, and lifted up his eyes</a>
<a id='line_7352'>  And saw the barge that brought her moving down,</a>
<a id='line_7353'>  Far-off, a blot upon the stream, and said</a>
<a id='line_7354'>  Low in himself, 'Ah simple heart and sweet,</a>
<a id='line_7355'>  Ye loved me, damsel, surely with a love</a>
<a id='line_7356'>  Far tenderer than my Queen's.  Pray for thy soul?</a>
<a id='line_7357'>  Ay, that will I.  Farewell too--now at last--</a>
<a id='line_7358'>  Farewell, fair lily.  "Jealousy in love?"</a>
<a id='line_7359'>  Not rather dead love's harsh heir, jealous pride?</a>
<a id='line_7360'>  Queen, if I grant the jealousy as of love,</a>
<a id='line_7361'>  May not your crescent fear for name and fame</a>
<a id='line_7362'>  Speak, as it waxes, of a love that wanes?</a>
<a id='line_7363'>  Why did the King dwell on my name to me?</a>
<a id='line_7364'>  Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach,</a>
<a id='line_7365'>  Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake</a>
<a id='line_7366'>  Caught from his mother's arms--the wondrous one</a>
<a id='line_7367'>  Who passes through the vision of the night--</a>
<a id='line_7368'>  She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns</a>
<a id='line_7369'>  Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn</a>
<a id='line_7370'>  She kissed me saying, "Thou art fair, my child,</a>
<a id='line_7371'>  As a king's son," and often in her arms</a>
<a id='line_7372'>  She bare me, pacing on the dusky mere.</a>
<a id='line_7373'>  Would she had drowned me in it, where'er it be!</a>
<a id='line_7374'>  For what am I? what profits me my name</a>
<a id='line_7375'>  Of greatest knight?  I fought for it, and have it:</a>
<a id='line_7376'>  Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain;</a>
<a id='line_7377'>  Now grown a part of me:  but what use in it?</a>
<a id='line_7378'>  To make men worse by making my sin known?</a>
<a id='line_7379'>  Or sin seem less, the sinner seeming great?</a>
<a id='line_7380'>  Alas for Arthur's greatest knight, a man</a>
<a id='line_7381'>  Not after Arthur's heart!  I needs must break</a>
<a id='line_7382'>  These bonds that so defame me:  not without</a>
<a id='line_7383'>  She wills it:  would I, if she willed it? nay,</a>
<a id='line_7384'>  Who knows? but if I would not, then may God,</a>
<a id='line_7385'>  I pray him, send a sudden Angel down</a>
<a id='line_7386'>  To seize me by the hair and bear me far,</a>
<a id='line_7387'>  And fling me deep in that forgotten mere,</a>
<a id='line_7388'>  Among the tumbled fragments of the hills.'</a>
<a id='line_7389'></a>
<a id='line_7390'>     So groaned Sir Lancelot in remorseful pain,</a>
<a id='line_7391'>  Not knowing he should die a holy man.</a>
<a id='line_7392'></a>
<a id='line_7393'></a>
<a id='line_7394'></a>
<a id='line_7395'>  The Holy Grail</a>
<a id='line_7396'></a>
<a id='line_7397'>  From noiseful arms, and acts of prowess done</a>
<a id='line_7398'>  In tournament or tilt, Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_7399'>  Whom Arthur and his knighthood called The Pure,</a>
<a id='line_7400'>  Had passed into the silent life of prayer,</a>
<a id='line_7401'>  Praise, fast, and alms; and leaving for the cowl</a>
<a id='line_7402'>  The helmet in an abbey far away</a>
<a id='line_7403'>  From Camelot, there, and not long after, died.</a>
<a id='line_7404'></a>
<a id='line_7405'>     And one, a fellow-monk among the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7406'>  Ambrosius, loved him much beyond the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7407'>  And honoured him, and wrought into his heart</a>
<a id='line_7408'>  A way by love that wakened love within,</a>
<a id='line_7409'>  To answer that which came:  and as they sat</a>
<a id='line_7410'>  Beneath a world-old yew-tree, darkening half</a>
<a id='line_7411'>  The cloisters, on a gustful April morn</a>
<a id='line_7412'>  That puffed the swaying branches into smoke</a>
<a id='line_7413'>  Above them, ere the summer when he died</a>
<a id='line_7414'>  The monk Ambrosius questioned Percivale:</a>
<a id='line_7415'></a>
<a id='line_7416'>     'O brother, I have seen this yew-tree smoke,</a>
<a id='line_7417'>  Spring after spring, for half a hundred years:</a>
<a id='line_7418'>  For never have I known the world without,</a>
<a id='line_7419'>  Nor ever strayed beyond the pale:  but thee,</a>
<a id='line_7420'>  When first thou camest--such a courtesy</a>
<a id='line_7421'>  Spake through the limbs and in the voice--I knew</a>
<a id='line_7422'>  For one of those who eat in Arthur's hall;</a>
<a id='line_7423'>  For good ye are and bad, and like to coins,</a>
<a id='line_7424'>  Some true, some light, but every one of you</a>
<a id='line_7425'>  Stamped with the image of the King; and now</a>
<a id='line_7426'>  Tell me, what drove thee from the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_7427'>  My brother? was it earthly passion crost?'</a>
<a id='line_7428'></a>
<a id='line_7429'>     'Nay,' said the knight; 'for no such passion mine.</a>
<a id='line_7430'>  But the sweet vision of the Holy Grail</a>
<a id='line_7431'>  Drove me from all vainglories, rivalries,</a>
<a id='line_7432'>  And earthly heats that spring and sparkle out</a>
<a id='line_7433'>  Among us in the jousts, while women watch</a>
<a id='line_7434'>  Who wins, who falls; and waste the spiritual strength</a>
<a id='line_7435'>  Within us, better offered up to Heaven.'</a>
<a id='line_7436'></a>
<a id='line_7437'>     To whom the monk:  'The Holy Grail!--I trust</a>
<a id='line_7438'>  We are green in Heaven's eyes; but here too much</a>
<a id='line_7439'>  We moulder--as to things without I mean--</a>
<a id='line_7440'>  Yet one of your own knights, a guest of ours,</a>
<a id='line_7441'>  Told us of this in our refectory,</a>
<a id='line_7442'>  But spake with such a sadness and so low</a>
<a id='line_7443'>  We heard not half of what he said.  What is it?</a>
<a id='line_7444'>  The phantom of a cup that comes and goes?'</a>
<a id='line_7445'></a>
<a id='line_7446'>     'Nay, monk! what phantom?' answered Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_7447'>  'The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord</a>
<a id='line_7448'>  Drank at the last sad supper with his own.</a>
<a id='line_7449'>  This, from the blessed land of Aromat--</a>
<a id='line_7450'>  After the day of darkness, when the dead</a>
<a id='line_7451'>  Went wandering o'er Moriah--the good saint</a>
<a id='line_7452'>  Arimathaean Joseph, journeying brought</a>
<a id='line_7453'>  To Glastonbury, where the winter thorn</a>
<a id='line_7454'>  Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_7455'>  And there awhile it bode; and if a man</a>
<a id='line_7456'>  Could touch or see it, he was healed at once,</a>
<a id='line_7457'>  By faith, of all his ills.  But then the times</a>
<a id='line_7458'>  Grew to such evil that the holy cup</a>
<a id='line_7459'>  Was caught away to Heaven, and disappeared.'</a>
<a id='line_7460'></a>
<a id='line_7461'>     To whom the monk:  'From our old books I know</a>
<a id='line_7462'>  That Joseph came of old to Glastonbury,</a>
<a id='line_7463'>  And there the heathen Prince, Arviragus,</a>
<a id='line_7464'>  Gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build;</a>
<a id='line_7465'>  And there he built with wattles from the marsh</a>
<a id='line_7466'>  A little lonely church in days of yore,</a>
<a id='line_7467'>  For so they say, these books of ours, but seem</a>
<a id='line_7468'>  Mute of this miracle, far as I have read.</a>
<a id='line_7469'>  But who first saw the holy thing today?'</a>
<a id='line_7470'></a>
<a id='line_7471'>     'A woman,' answered Percivale, 'a nun,</a>
<a id='line_7472'>  And one no further off in blood from me</a>
<a id='line_7473'>  Than sister; and if ever holy maid</a>
<a id='line_7474'>  With knees of adoration wore the stone,</a>
<a id='line_7475'>  A holy maid; though never maiden glowed,</a>
<a id='line_7476'>  But that was in her earlier maidenhood,</a>
<a id='line_7477'>  With such a fervent flame of human love,</a>
<a id='line_7478'>  Which being rudely blunted, glanced and shot</a>
<a id='line_7479'>  Only to holy things; to prayer and praise</a>
<a id='line_7480'>  She gave herself, to fast and alms.  And yet,</a>
<a id='line_7481'>  Nun as she was, the scandal of the Court,</a>
<a id='line_7482'>  Sin against Arthur and the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_7483'>  And the strange sound of an adulterous race,</a>
<a id='line_7484'>  Across the iron grating of her cell</a>
<a id='line_7485'>  Beat, and she prayed and fasted all the more.</a>
<a id='line_7486'></a>
<a id='line_7487'>     'And he to whom she told her sins, or what</a>
<a id='line_7488'>  Her all but utter whiteness held for sin,</a>
<a id='line_7489'>  A man wellnigh a hundred winters old,</a>
<a id='line_7490'>  Spake often with her of the Holy Grail,</a>
<a id='line_7491'>  A legend handed down through five or six,</a>
<a id='line_7492'>  And each of these a hundred winters old,</a>
<a id='line_7493'>  From our Lord's time.  And when King Arthur made</a>
<a id='line_7494'>  His Table Round, and all men's hearts became</a>
<a id='line_7495'>  Clean for a season, surely he had thought</a>
<a id='line_7496'>  That now the Holy Grail would come again;</a>
<a id='line_7497'>  But sin broke out.  Ah, Christ, that it would come,</a>
<a id='line_7498'>  And heal the world of all their wickedness!</a>
<a id='line_7499'>  "O Father!" asked the maiden, "might it come</a>
<a id='line_7500'>  To me by prayer and fasting?"  "Nay," said he,</a>
<a id='line_7501'>  "I know not, for thy heart is pure as snow."</a>
<a id='line_7502'>  And so she prayed and fasted, till the sun</a>
<a id='line_7503'>  Shone, and the wind blew, through her, and I thought</a>
<a id='line_7504'>  She might have risen and floated when I saw her.</a>
<a id='line_7505'></a>
<a id='line_7506'>     'For on a day she sent to speak with me.</a>
<a id='line_7507'>  And when she came to speak, behold her eyes</a>
<a id='line_7508'>  Beyond my knowing of them, beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_7509'>  Beyond all knowing of them, wonderful,</a>
<a id='line_7510'>  Beautiful in the light of holiness.</a>
<a id='line_7511'>  And "O my brother Percivale," she said,</a>
<a id='line_7512'>  "Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail:</a>
<a id='line_7513'>  For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound</a>
<a id='line_7514'>  As of a silver horn from o'er the hills</a>
<a id='line_7515'>  Blown, and I thought, 'It is not Arthur's use</a>
<a id='line_7516'>  To hunt by moonlight;' and the slender sound</a>
<a id='line_7517'>  As from a distance beyond distance grew</a>
<a id='line_7518'>  Coming upon me--O never harp nor horn,</a>
<a id='line_7519'>  Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,</a>
<a id='line_7520'>  Was like that music as it came; and then</a>
<a id='line_7521'>  Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam,</a>
<a id='line_7522'>  And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,</a>
<a id='line_7523'>  Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,</a>
<a id='line_7524'>  Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed</a>
<a id='line_7525'>  With rosy colours leaping on the wall;</a>
<a id='line_7526'>  And then the music faded, and the Grail</a>
<a id='line_7527'>  Past, and the beam decayed, and from the walls</a>
<a id='line_7528'>  The rosy quiverings died into the night.</a>
<a id='line_7529'>  So now the Holy Thing is here again</a>
<a id='line_7530'>  Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,</a>
<a id='line_7531'>  And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,</a>
<a id='line_7532'>  That so perchance the vision may be seen</a>
<a id='line_7533'>  By thee and those, and all the world be healed."</a>
<a id='line_7534'></a>
<a id='line_7535'>     'Then leaving the pale nun, I spake of this</a>
<a id='line_7536'>  To all men; and myself fasted and prayed</a>
<a id='line_7537'>  Always, and many among us many a week</a>
<a id='line_7538'>  Fasted and prayed even to the uttermost,</a>
<a id='line_7539'>  Expectant of the wonder that would be.</a>
<a id='line_7540'></a>
<a id='line_7541'>     'And one there was among us, ever moved</a>
<a id='line_7542'>  Among us in white armour, Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_7543'>  "God make thee good as thou art beautiful,"</a>
<a id='line_7544'>  Said Arthur, when he dubbed him knight; and none,</a>
<a id='line_7545'>  In so young youth, was ever made a knight</a>
<a id='line_7546'>  Till Galahad; and this Galahad, when he heard</a>
<a id='line_7547'>  My sister's vision, filled me with amaze;</a>
<a id='line_7548'>  His eyes became so like her own, they seemed</a>
<a id='line_7549'>  Hers, and himself her brother more than I.</a>
<a id='line_7550'></a>
<a id='line_7551'>     'Sister or brother none had he; but some</a>
<a id='line_7552'>  Called him a son of Lancelot, and some said</a>
<a id='line_7553'>  Begotten by enchantment--chatterers they,</a>
<a id='line_7554'>  Like birds of passage piping up and down,</a>
<a id='line_7555'>  That gape for flies--we know not whence they come;</a>
<a id='line_7556'>  For when was Lancelot wanderingly lewd?</a>
<a id='line_7557'></a>
<a id='line_7558'>     'But she, the wan sweet maiden, shore away</a>
<a id='line_7559'>  Clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair</a>
<a id='line_7560'>  Which made a silken mat-work for her feet;</a>
<a id='line_7561'>  And out of this she plaited broad and long</a>
<a id='line_7562'>  A strong sword-belt, and wove with silver thread</a>
<a id='line_7563'>  And crimson in the belt a strange device,</a>
<a id='line_7564'>  A crimson grail within a silver beam;</a>
<a id='line_7565'>  And saw the bright boy-knight, and bound it on him,</a>
<a id='line_7566'>  Saying, "My knight, my love, my knight of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_7567'>  O thou, my love, whose love is one with mine,</a>
<a id='line_7568'>  I, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.</a>
<a id='line_7569'>  Go forth, for thou shalt see what I have seen,</a>
<a id='line_7570'>  And break through all, till one will crown thee king</a>
<a id='line_7571'>  Far in the spiritual city:" and as she spake</a>
<a id='line_7572'>  She sent the deathless passion in her eyes</a>
<a id='line_7573'>  Through him, and made him hers, and laid her mind</a>
<a id='line_7574'>  On him, and he believed in her belief.</a>
<a id='line_7575'></a>
<a id='line_7576'>     'Then came a year of miracle:  O brother,</a>
<a id='line_7577'>  In our great hall there stood a vacant chair,</a>
<a id='line_7578'>  Fashioned by Merlin ere he past away,</a>
<a id='line_7579'>  And carven with strange figures; and in and out</a>
<a id='line_7580'>  The figures, like a serpent, ran a scroll</a>
<a id='line_7581'>  Of letters in a tongue no man could read.</a>
<a id='line_7582'>  And Merlin called it "The Siege perilous,"</a>
<a id='line_7583'>  Perilous for good and ill; "for there," he said,</a>
<a id='line_7584'>  "No man could sit but he should lose himself:"</a>
<a id='line_7585'>  And once by misadvertence Merlin sat</a>
<a id='line_7586'>  In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,</a>
<a id='line_7587'>  Galahad, when he heard of Merlin's doom,</a>
<a id='line_7588'>  Cried, "If I lose myself, I save myself!"</a>
<a id='line_7589'></a>
<a id='line_7590'>     'Then on a summer night it came to pass,</a>
<a id='line_7591'>  While the great banquet lay along the hall,</a>
<a id='line_7592'>  That Galahad would sit down in Merlin's chair.</a>
<a id='line_7593'></a>
<a id='line_7594'>     'And all at once, as there we sat, we heard</a>
<a id='line_7595'>  A cracking and a riving of the roofs,</a>
<a id='line_7596'>  And rending, and a blast, and overhead</a>
<a id='line_7597'>  Thunder, and in the thunder was a cry.</a>
<a id='line_7598'>  And in the blast there smote along the hall</a>
<a id='line_7599'>  A beam of light seven times more clear than day:</a>
<a id='line_7600'>  And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail</a>
<a id='line_7601'>  All over covered with a luminous cloud.</a>
<a id='line_7602'>  And none might see who bare it, and it past.</a>
<a id='line_7603'>  But every knight beheld his fellow's face</a>
<a id='line_7604'>  As in a glory, and all the knights arose,</a>
<a id='line_7605'>  And staring each at other like dumb men</a>
<a id='line_7606'>  Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.</a>
<a id='line_7607'></a>
<a id='line_7608'>     'I sware a vow before them all, that I,</a>
<a id='line_7609'>  Because I had not seen the Grail, would ride</a>
<a id='line_7610'>  A twelvemonth and a day in quest of it,</a>
<a id='line_7611'>  Until I found and saw it, as the nun</a>
<a id='line_7612'>  My sister saw it; and Galahad sware the vow,</a>
<a id='line_7613'>  And good Sir Bors, our Lancelot's cousin, sware,</a>
<a id='line_7614'>  And Lancelot sware, and many among the knights,</a>
<a id='line_7615'>  And Gawain sware, and louder than the rest.'</a>
<a id='line_7616'></a>
<a id='line_7617'>     Then spake the monk Ambrosius, asking him,</a>
<a id='line_7618'>  'What said the King?  Did Arthur take the vow?'</a>
<a id='line_7619'></a>
<a id='line_7620'>     'Nay, for my lord,' said Percivale, 'the King,</a>
<a id='line_7621'>  Was not in hall:  for early that same day,</a>
<a id='line_7622'>  Scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold,</a>
<a id='line_7623'>  An outraged maiden sprang into the hall</a>
<a id='line_7624'>  Crying on help:  for all her shining hair</a>
<a id='line_7625'>  Was smeared with earth, and either milky arm</a>
<a id='line_7626'>  Red-rent with hooks of bramble, and all she wore</a>
<a id='line_7627'>  Torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn</a>
<a id='line_7628'>  In tempest:  so the King arose and went</a>
<a id='line_7629'>  To smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees</a>
<a id='line_7630'>  That made such honey in his realm.  Howbeit</a>
<a id='line_7631'>  Some little of this marvel he too saw,</a>
<a id='line_7632'>  Returning o'er the plain that then began</a>
<a id='line_7633'>  To darken under Camelot; whence the King</a>
<a id='line_7634'>  Looked up, calling aloud, "Lo, there! the roofs</a>
<a id='line_7635'>  Of our great hall are rolled in thunder-smoke!</a>
<a id='line_7636'>  Pray Heaven, they be not smitten by the bolt."</a>
<a id='line_7637'>  For dear to Arthur was that hall of ours,</a>
<a id='line_7638'>  As having there so oft with all his knights</a>
<a id='line_7639'>  Feasted, and as the stateliest under heaven.</a>
<a id='line_7640'></a>
<a id='line_7641'>     'O brother, had you known our mighty hall,</a>
<a id='line_7642'>  Which Merlin built for Arthur long ago!</a>
<a id='line_7643'>  For all the sacred mount of Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_7644'>  And all the dim rich city, roof by roof,</a>
<a id='line_7645'>  Tower after tower, spire beyond spire,</a>
<a id='line_7646'>  By grove, and garden-lawn, and rushing brook,</a>
<a id='line_7647'>  Climbs to the mighty hall that Merlin built.</a>
<a id='line_7648'>  And four great zones of sculpture, set betwixt</a>
<a id='line_7649'>  With many a mystic symbol, gird the hall:</a>
<a id='line_7650'>  And in the lowest beasts are slaying men,</a>
<a id='line_7651'>  And in the second men are slaying beasts,</a>
<a id='line_7652'>  And on the third are warriors, perfect men,</a>
<a id='line_7653'>  And on the fourth are men with growing wings,</a>
<a id='line_7654'>  And over all one statue in the mould</a>
<a id='line_7655'>  Of Arthur, made by Merlin, with a crown,</a>
<a id='line_7656'>  And peaked wings pointed to the Northern Star.</a>
<a id='line_7657'>  And eastward fronts the statue, and the crown</a>
<a id='line_7658'>  And both the wings are made of gold, and flame</a>
<a id='line_7659'>  At sunrise till the people in far fields,</a>
<a id='line_7660'>  Wasted so often by the heathen hordes,</a>
<a id='line_7661'>  Behold it, crying, "We have still a King."</a>
<a id='line_7662'></a>
<a id='line_7663'>     'And, brother, had you known our hall within,</a>
<a id='line_7664'>  Broader and higher than any in all the lands!</a>
<a id='line_7665'>  Where twelve great windows blazon Arthur's wars,</a>
<a id='line_7666'>  And all the light that falls upon the board</a>
<a id='line_7667'>  Streams through the twelve great battles of our King.</a>
<a id='line_7668'>  Nay, one there is, and at the eastern end,</a>
<a id='line_7669'>  Wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere,</a>
<a id='line_7670'>  Where Arthur finds the brand Excalibur.</a>
<a id='line_7671'>  And also one to the west, and counter to it,</a>
<a id='line_7672'>  And blank:  and who shall blazon it? when and how?--</a>
<a id='line_7673'>  O there, perchance, when all our wars are done,</a>
<a id='line_7674'>  The brand Excalibur will be cast away.</a>
<a id='line_7675'></a>
<a id='line_7676'>     'So to this hall full quickly rode the King,</a>
<a id='line_7677'>  In horror lest the work by Merlin wrought,</a>
<a id='line_7678'>  Dreamlike, should on the sudden vanish, wrapt</a>
<a id='line_7679'>  In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.</a>
<a id='line_7680'>  And in he rode, and up I glanced, and saw</a>
<a id='line_7681'>  The golden dragon sparkling over all:</a>

<a id='line_7683'>  Hacked, and their foreheads grimed with smoke, and seared,</a>
<a id='line_7684'>  Followed, and in among bright faces, ours,</a>
<a id='line_7685'>  Full of the vision, prest:  and then the King</a>
<a id='line_7686'>  Spake to me, being nearest, "Percivale,"</a>
<a id='line_7687'>  (Because the hall was all in tumult--some</a>
<a id='line_7688'>  Vowing, and some protesting), "what is this?"</a>

<a id='line_7690'>     'O brother, when I told him what had chanced,</a>
<a id='line_7691'>  My sister's vision, and the rest, his face</a>
<a id='line_7692'>  Darkened, as I have seen it more than once,</a>
<a id='line_7693'>  When some brave deed seemed to be done in vain,</a>
<a id='line_7694'>  Darken; and "Woe is me, my knights," he cried,</a>
<a id='line_7695'>  "Had I been here, ye had not sworn the vow."</a>
<a id='line_7696'>  Bold was mine answer, "Had thyself been here,</a>

<a id='line_7752'></a>
<a id='line_7753'>     'So when the sun broke next from under ground,</a>

<a id='line_7760'>  So many knights that all the people cried,</a>
<a id='line_7761'>  And almost burst the barriers in their heat,</a>
<a id='line_7762'>  Shouting, "Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale!"</a>
<a id='line_7763'></a>
<a id='line_7764'>     'But when the next day brake from under ground--</a>
<a id='line_7765'>  O brother, had you known our Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_7766'>  Built by old kings, age after age, so old</a>
<a id='line_7767'>  The King himself had fears that it would fall,</a>
<a id='line_7768'>  So strange, and rich, and dim; for where the roofs</a>
<a id='line_7769'>  Tottered toward each other in the sky,</a>
<a id='line_7770'>  Met foreheads all along the street of those</a>
<a id='line_7771'>  Who watched us pass; and lower, and where the long</a>
<a id='line_7772'>  Rich galleries, lady-laden, weighed the necks</a>
<a id='line_7773'>  Of dragons clinging to the crazy walls,</a>
<a id='line_7774'>  Thicker than drops from thunder, showers of flowers</a>
<a id='line_7775'>  Fell as we past; and men and boys astride</a>
<a id='line_7776'>  On wyvern, lion, dragon, griffin, swan,</a>
<a id='line_7777'>  At all the corners, named us each by name,</a>
<a id='line_7778'>  Calling, "God speed!" but in the ways below</a>
<a id='line_7779'>  The knights and ladies wept, and rich and poor</a>
<a id='line_7780'>  Wept, and the King himself could hardly speak</a>
<a id='line_7781'>  For grief, and all in middle street the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_7782'>  Who rode by Lancelot, wailed and shrieked aloud,</a>
<a id='line_7783'>  "This madness has come on us for our sins."</a>
<a id='line_7784'>  So to the Gate of the three Queens we came,</a>
<a id='line_7785'>  Where Arthur's wars are rendered mystically,</a>
<a id='line_7786'>  And thence departed every one his way.</a>
<a id='line_7787'></a>
<a id='line_7788'>     'And I was lifted up in heart, and thought</a>

<a id='line_7791'>  So many and famous names; and never yet</a>
<a id='line_7792'>  Had heaven appeared so blue, nor earth so green,</a>
<a id='line_7793'>  For all my blood danced in me, and I knew</a>
<a id='line_7794'>  That I should light upon the Holy Grail.</a>
<a id='line_7795'></a>
<a id='line_7796'>     'Thereafter, the dark warning of our King,</a>
<a id='line_7797'>  That most of us would follow wandering fires,</a>
<a id='line_7798'>  Came like a driving gloom across my mind.</a>
<a id='line_7799'>  Then every evil word I had spoken once,</a>

<a id='line_7803'>  And lifting up mine eyes, I found myself</a>
<a id='line_7804'>  Alone, and in a land of sand and thorns,</a>
<a id='line_7805'>  And I was thirsty even unto death;</a>
<a id='line_7806'>  And I, too, cried, "This Quest is not for thee."</a>
<a id='line_7807'></a>
<a id='line_7808'>     'And on I rode, and when I thought my thirst</a>
<a id='line_7809'>  Would slay me, saw deep lawns, and then a brook,</a>
<a id='line_7810'>  With one sharp rapid, where the crisping white</a>
<a id='line_7811'>  Played ever back upon the sloping wave,</a>
<a id='line_7812'>  And took both ear and eye; and o'er the brook</a>
<a id='line_7813'>  Were apple-trees, and apples by the brook</a>
<a id='line_7814'>  Fallen, and on the lawns.  "I will rest here,"</a>
<a id='line_7815'>  I said, "I am not worthy of the Quest;"</a>
<a id='line_7816'>  But even while I drank the brook, and ate</a>
<a id='line_7817'>  The goodly apples, all these things at once</a>
<a id='line_7818'>  Fell into dust, and I was left alone,</a>
<a id='line_7819'>  And thirsting, in a land of sand and thorns.</a>
<a id='line_7820'></a>
<a id='line_7821'>     'And then behold a woman at a door</a>
<a id='line_7822'>  Spinning; and fair the house whereby she sat,</a>

<a id='line_7824'>  And all her bearing gracious; and she rose</a>
<a id='line_7825'>  Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,</a>
<a id='line_7826'>  "Rest here;" but when I touched her, lo! she, too,</a>
<a id='line_7827'>  Fell into dust and nothing, and the house</a>
<a id='line_7828'>  Became no better than a broken shed,</a>
<a id='line_7829'>  And in it a dead babe; and also this</a>
<a id='line_7830'>  Fell into dust, and I was left alone.</a>
<a id='line_7831'></a>
<a id='line_7832'>     'And on I rode, and greater was my thirst.</a>
<a id='line_7833'>  Then flashed a yellow gleam across the world,</a>
<a id='line_7834'>  And where it smote the plowshare in the field,</a>
<a id='line_7835'>  The plowman left his plowing, and fell down</a>
<a id='line_7836'>  Before it; where it glittered on her pail,</a>
<a id='line_7837'>  The milkmaid left her milking, and fell down</a>
<a id='line_7838'>  Before it, and I knew not why, but thought</a>
<a id='line_7839'>  "The sun is rising," though the sun had risen.</a>
<a id='line_7840'>  Then was I ware of one that on me moved</a>
<a id='line_7841'>  In golden armour with a crown of gold</a>
<a id='line_7842'>  About a casque all jewels; and his horse</a>
<a id='line_7843'>  In golden armour jewelled everywhere:</a>
<a id='line_7844'>  And on the splendour came, flashing me blind;</a>
<a id='line_7845'>  And seemed to me the Lord of all the world,</a>
<a id='line_7846'>  Being so huge.  But when I thought he meant</a>
<a id='line_7847'>  To crush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,</a>
<a id='line_7848'>  Opened his arms to embrace me as he came,</a>
<a id='line_7849'>  And up I went and touched him, and he, too,</a>
<a id='line_7850'>  Fell into dust, and I was left alone</a>
<a id='line_7851'>  And wearying in a land of sand and thorns.</a>
<a id='line_7852'></a>
<a id='line_7853'>     'And I rode on and found a mighty hill,</a>
<a id='line_7854'>  And on the top, a city walled:  the spires</a>
<a id='line_7855'>  Pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven.</a>
<a id='line_7856'>  And by the gateway stirred a crowd; and these</a>
<a id='line_7857'>  Cried to me climbing, "Welcome, Percivale!</a>
<a id='line_7858'>  Thou mightiest and thou purest among men!"</a>
<a id='line_7859'>  And glad was I and clomb, but found at top</a>
<a id='line_7860'>  No man, nor any voice.  And thence I past</a>
<a id='line_7861'>  Far through a ruinous city, and I saw</a>
<a id='line_7862'>  That man had once dwelt there; but there I found</a>
<a id='line_7863'>  Only one man of an exceeding age.</a>
<a id='line_7864'>  "Where is that goodly company," said I,</a>
<a id='line_7865'>  "That so cried out upon me?" and he had</a>
<a id='line_7866'>  Scarce any voice to answer, and yet gasped,</a>
<a id='line_7867'>  "Whence and what art thou?" and even as he spoke</a>
<a id='line_7868'>  Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I</a>
<a id='line_7869'>  Was left alone once more, and cried in grief,</a>
<a id='line_7870'>  "Lo, if I find the Holy Grail itself</a>
<a id='line_7871'>  And touch it, it will crumble into dust."</a>
<a id='line_7872'></a>
<a id='line_7873'>     'And thence I dropt into a lowly vale,</a>
<a id='line_7874'>  Low as the hill was high, and where the vale</a>
<a id='line_7875'>  Was lowest, found a chapel, and thereby</a>
<a id='line_7876'>  A holy hermit in a hermitage,</a>
<a id='line_7877'>  To whom I told my phantoms, and he said:</a>
<a id='line_7878'></a>
<a id='line_7879'>     '"O son, thou hast not true humility,</a>
<a id='line_7880'>  The highest virtue, mother of them all;</a>
<a id='line_7881'>  For when the Lord of all things made Himself</a>
<a id='line_7882'>  Naked of glory for His mortal change,</a>
<a id='line_7883'>  'Take thou my robe,' she said, 'for all is thine,'</a>
<a id='line_7884'>  And all her form shone forth with sudden light</a>
<a id='line_7885'>  So that the angels were amazed, and she</a>
<a id='line_7886'>  Followed Him down, and like a flying star</a>
<a id='line_7887'>  Led on the gray-haired wisdom of the east;</a>
<a id='line_7888'>  But her thou hast not known:  for what is this</a>
<a id='line_7889'>  Thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?</a>
<a id='line_7890'>  Thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself</a>
<a id='line_7891'>  As Galahad."  When the hermit made an end,</a>
<a id='line_7892'>  In silver armour suddenly Galahad shone</a>
<a id='line_7893'>  Before us, and against the chapel door</a>
<a id='line_7894'>  Laid lance, and entered, and we knelt in prayer.</a>
<a id='line_7895'>  And there the hermit slaked my burning thirst,</a>
<a id='line_7896'>  And at the sacring of the mass I saw</a>
<a id='line_7897'>  The holy elements alone; but he,</a>
<a id='line_7898'>  "Saw ye no more?  I, Galahad, saw the Grail,</a>
<a id='line_7899'>  The Holy Grail, descend upon the shrine:</a>
<a id='line_7900'>  I saw the fiery face as of a child</a>
<a id='line_7901'>  That smote itself into the bread, and went;</a>
<a id='line_7902'>  And hither am I come; and never yet</a>
<a id='line_7903'>  Hath what thy sister taught me first to see,</a>
<a id='line_7904'>  This Holy Thing, failed from my side, nor come</a>
<a id='line_7905'>  Covered, but moving with me night and day,</a>
<a id='line_7906'>  Fainter by day, but always in the night</a>
<a id='line_7907'>  Blood-red, and sliding down the blackened marsh</a>
<a id='line_7908'>  Blood-red, and on the naked mountain top</a>
<a id='line_7909'>  Blood-red, and in the sleeping mere below</a>
<a id='line_7910'>  Blood-red.  And in the strength of this I rode,</a>
<a id='line_7911'>  Shattering all evil customs everywhere,</a>
<a id='line_7912'>  And past through Pagan realms, and made them mine,</a>
<a id='line_7913'>  And clashed with Pagan hordes, and bore them down,</a>
<a id='line_7914'>  And broke through all, and in the strength of this</a>
<a id='line_7915'>  Come victor.  But my time is hard at hand,</a>
<a id='line_7916'>  And hence I go; and one will crown me king</a>
<a id='line_7917'>  Far in the spiritual city; and come thou, too,</a>
<a id='line_7918'>  For thou shalt see the vision when I go."</a>
<a id='line_7919'></a>
<a id='line_7920'>     'While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,</a>
<a id='line_7921'>  Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew</a>
<a id='line_7922'>  One with him, to believe as he believed.</a>
<a id='line_7923'>  Then, when the day began to wane, we went.</a>
<a id='line_7924'></a>
<a id='line_7925'>     'There rose a hill that none but man could climb,</a>
<a id='line_7926'>  Scarred with a hundred wintry water-courses--</a>
<a id='line_7927'>  Storm at the top, and when we gained it, storm</a>
<a id='line_7928'>  Round us and death; for every moment glanced</a>
<a id='line_7929'>  His silver arms and gloomed:  so quick and thick</a>
<a id='line_7930'>  The lightnings here and there to left and right</a>
<a id='line_7931'>  Struck, till the dry old trunks about us, dead,</a>
<a id='line_7932'>  Yea, rotten with a hundred years of death,</a>
<a id='line_7933'>  Sprang into fire:  and at the base we found</a>
<a id='line_7934'>  On either hand, as far as eye could see,</a>
<a id='line_7935'>  A great black swamp and of an evil smell,</a>
<a id='line_7936'>  Part black, part whitened with the bones of men,</a>
<a id='line_7937'>  Not to be crost, save that some ancient king</a>
<a id='line_7938'>  Had built a way, where, linked with many a bridge,</a>
<a id='line_7939'>  A thousand piers ran into the great Sea.</a>
<a id='line_7940'>  And Galahad fled along them bridge by bridge,</a>
<a id='line_7941'>  And every bridge as quickly as he crost</a>
<a id='line_7942'>  Sprang into fire and vanished, though I yearned</a>
<a id='line_7943'>  To follow; and thrice above him all the heavens</a>
<a id='line_7944'>  Opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed</a>
<a id='line_7945'>  Shoutings of all the sons of God:  and first</a>
<a id='line_7946'>  At once I saw him far on the great Sea,</a>
<a id='line_7947'>  In silver-shining armour starry-clear;</a>
<a id='line_7948'>  And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung</a>
<a id='line_7949'>  Clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud.</a>
<a id='line_7950'>  And with exceeding swiftness ran the boat,</a>
<a id='line_7951'>  If boat it were--I saw not whence it came.</a>
<a id='line_7952'>  And when the heavens opened and blazed again</a>
<a id='line_7953'>  Roaring, I saw him like a silver star--</a>
<a id='line_7954'>  And had he set the sail, or had the boat</a>
<a id='line_7955'>  Become a living creature clad with wings?</a>
<a id='line_7956'>  And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung</a>
<a id='line_7957'>  Redder than any rose, a joy to me,</a>
<a id='line_7958'>  For now I knew the veil had been withdrawn.</a>
<a id='line_7959'>  Then in a moment when they blazed again</a>
<a id='line_7960'>  Opening, I saw the least of little stars</a>
<a id='line_7961'>  Down on the waste, and straight beyond the star</a>
<a id='line_7962'>  I saw the spiritual city and all her spires</a>
<a id='line_7963'>  And gateways in a glory like one pearl--</a>
<a id='line_7964'>  No larger, though the goal of all the saints--</a>
<a id='line_7965'>  Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot</a>
<a id='line_7966'>  A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there</a>
<a id='line_7967'>  Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail,</a>
<a id='line_7968'>  Which never eyes on earth again shall see.</a>
<a id='line_7969'>  Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep.</a>
<a id='line_7970'>  And how my feet recrost the deathful ridge</a>
<a id='line_7971'>  No memory in me lives; but that I touched</a>
<a id='line_7972'>  The chapel-doors at dawn I know; and thence</a>
<a id='line_7973'>  Taking my war-horse from the holy man,</a>
<a id='line_7974'>  Glad that no phantom vext me more, returned</a>
<a id='line_7975'>  To whence I came, the gate of Arthur's wars.'</a>
<a id='line_7976'></a>
<a id='line_7977'>     'O brother,' asked Ambrosius,--'for in sooth</a>
<a id='line_7978'>  These ancient books--and they would win thee--teem,</a>
<a id='line_7979'>  Only I find not there this Holy Grail,</a>

<a id='line_7983'>  Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass</a>
<a id='line_7984'>  Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,</a>
<a id='line_7985'>  And almost plastered like a martin's nest</a>
<a id='line_7986'>  To these old walls--and mingle with our folk;</a>
<a id='line_7987'>  And knowing every honest face of theirs</a>

<a id='line_7996'>  Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,</a>
<a id='line_7997'>  Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs--</a>
<a id='line_7998'>  O brother, saving this Sir Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_7999'>  Came ye on none but phantoms in your quest,</a>
<a id='line_8000'>  No man, no woman?'</a>
<a id='line_8001'></a>
<a id='line_8002'>                    Then Sir Percivale:</a>
<a id='line_8003'>  'All men, to one so bound by such a vow,</a>
<a id='line_8004'>  And women were as phantoms.  O, my brother,</a>
<a id='line_8005'>  Why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee</a>
<a id='line_8006'>  How far I faltered from my quest and vow?</a>
<a id='line_8007'>  For after I had lain so many nights</a>
<a id='line_8008'>  A bedmate of the snail and eft and snake,</a>
<a id='line_8009'>  In grass and burdock, I was changed to wan</a>
<a id='line_8010'>  And meagre, and the vision had not come;</a>
<a id='line_8011'>  And then I chanced upon a goodly town</a>
<a id='line_8012'>  With one great dwelling in the middle of it;</a>
<a id='line_8013'>  Thither I made, and there was I disarmed</a>
<a id='line_8014'>  By maidens each as fair as any flower:</a>
<a id='line_8015'>  But when they led me into hall, behold,</a>
<a id='line_8016'>  The Princess of that castle was the one,</a>
<a id='line_8017'>  Brother, and that one only, who had ever</a>
<a id='line_8018'>  Made my heart leap; for when I moved of old</a>
<a id='line_8019'>  A slender page about her father's hall,</a>
<a id='line_8020'>  And she a slender maiden, all my heart</a>
<a id='line_8021'>  Went after her with longing:  yet we twain</a>
<a id='line_8022'>  Had never kissed a kiss, or vowed a vow.</a>
<a id='line_8023'>  And now I came upon her once again,</a>
<a id='line_8024'>  And one had wedded her, and he was dead,</a>
<a id='line_8025'>  And all his land and wealth and state were hers.</a>
<a id='line_8026'>  And while I tarried, every day she set</a>
<a id='line_8027'>  A banquet richer than the day before</a>
<a id='line_8028'>  By me; for all her longing and her will</a>
<a id='line_8029'>  Was toward me as of old; till one fair morn,</a>
<a id='line_8030'>  I walking to and fro beside a stream</a>
<a id='line_8031'>  That flashed across her orchard underneath</a>
<a id='line_8032'>  Her castle-walls, she stole upon my walk,</a>
<a id='line_8033'>  And calling me the greatest of all knights,</a>
<a id='line_8034'>  Embraced me, and so kissed me the first time,</a>
<a id='line_8035'>  And gave herself and all her wealth to me.</a>
<a id='line_8036'>  Then I remembered Arthur's warning word,</a>
<a id='line_8037'>  That most of us would follow wandering fires,</a>
<a id='line_8038'>  And the Quest faded in my heart.  Anon,</a>
<a id='line_8039'>  The heads of all her people drew to me,</a>
<a id='line_8040'>  With supplication both of knees and tongue:</a>
<a id='line_8041'>  "We have heard of thee:  thou art our greatest knight,</a>
<a id='line_8042'>  Our Lady says it, and we well believe:</a>
<a id='line_8043'>  Wed thou our Lady, and rule over us,</a>
<a id='line_8044'>  And thou shalt be as Arthur in our land."</a>
<a id='line_8045'>  O me, my brother! but one night my vow</a>
<a id='line_8046'>  Burnt me within, so that I rose and fled,</a>
<a id='line_8047'>  But wailed and wept, and hated mine own self,</a>
<a id='line_8048'>  And even the Holy Quest, and all but her;</a>
<a id='line_8049'>  Then after I was joined with Galahad</a>
<a id='line_8050'>  Cared not for her, nor anything upon earth.'</a>
<a id='line_8051'></a>
<a id='line_8052'>     Then said the monk, 'Poor men, when yule is cold,</a>
<a id='line_8053'>  Must be content to sit by little fires.</a>
<a id='line_8054'>  And this am I, so that ye care for me</a>
<a id='line_8055'>  Ever so little; yea, and blest be Heaven</a>
<a id='line_8056'>  That brought thee here to this poor house of ours</a>
<a id='line_8057'>  Where all the brethren are so hard, to warm</a>
<a id='line_8058'>  My cold heart with a friend:  but O the pity</a>
<a id='line_8059'>  To find thine own first love once more--to hold,</a>
<a id='line_8060'>  Hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms,</a>
<a id='line_8061'>  Or all but hold, and then--cast her aside,</a>
<a id='line_8062'>  Foregoing all her sweetness, like a weed.</a>
<a id='line_8063'>  For we that want the warmth of double life,</a>
<a id='line_8064'>  We that are plagued with dreams of something sweet</a>
<a id='line_8065'>  Beyond all sweetness in a life so rich,--</a>
<a id='line_8066'>  Ah, blessed Lord, I speak too earthlywise,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>  Seeing I never strayed beyond the cell,</a>
<a id='line_8068'>  But live like an old badger in his earth,</a>
<a id='line_8069'>  With earth about him everywhere, despite</a>
<a id='line_8070'>  All fast and penance.  Saw ye none beside,</a>
<a id='line_8071'>  None of your knights?'</a>
<a id='line_8072'></a>
<a id='line_8073'>                        'Yea so,' said Percivale:</a>
<a id='line_8074'>  'One night my pathway swerving east, I saw</a>
<a id='line_8075'>  The pelican on the casque of our Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_8076'>  All in the middle of the rising moon:</a>
<a id='line_8077'>  And toward him spurred, and hailed him, and he me,</a>
<a id='line_8078'>  And each made joy of either; then he asked,</a>
<a id='line_8079'>  "Where is he? hast thou seen him--Lancelot?--Once,"</a>
<a id='line_8080'>  Said good Sir Bors, "he dashed across me--mad,</a>
<a id='line_8081'>  And maddening what he rode:  and when I cried,</a>
<a id='line_8082'>  'Ridest thou then so hotly on a quest</a>
<a id='line_8083'>  So holy,' Lancelot shouted, 'Stay me not!</a>
<a id='line_8084'>  I have been the sluggard, and I ride apace,</a>
<a id='line_8085'>  For now there is a lion in the way.'</a>
<a id='line_8086'>  So vanished."</a>
<a id='line_8087'></a>
<a id='line_8088'>               'Then Sir Bors had ridden on</a>
<a id='line_8089'>  Softly, and sorrowing for our Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_8090'>  Because his former madness, once the talk</a>
<a id='line_8091'>  And scandal of our table, had returned;</a>
<a id='line_8092'>  For Lancelot's kith and kin so worship him</a>
<a id='line_8093'>  That ill to him is ill to them; to Bors</a>
<a id='line_8094'>  Beyond the rest:  he well had been content</a>
<a id='line_8095'>  Not to have seen, so Lancelot might have seen,</a>
<a id='line_8096'>  The Holy Cup of healing; and, indeed,</a>
<a id='line_8097'>  Being so clouded with his grief and love,</a>
<a id='line_8098'>  Small heart was his after the Holy Quest:</a>
<a id='line_8099'>  If God would send the vision, well:  if not,</a>
<a id='line_8100'>  The Quest and he were in the hands of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_8101'></a>
<a id='line_8102'>     'And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_8103'>  Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm,</a>
<a id='line_8104'>  And found a people there among their crags,</a>
<a id='line_8105'>  Our race and blood, a remnant that were left</a>
<a id='line_8106'>  Paynim amid their circles, and the stones</a>
<a id='line_8107'>  They pitch up straight to heaven:  and their wise men</a>
<a id='line_8108'>  Were strong in that old magic which can trace</a>
<a id='line_8109'>  The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him</a>
<a id='line_8110'>  And this high Quest as at a simple thing:</a>
<a id='line_8111'>  Told him he followed--almost Arthur's words--</a>
<a id='line_8112'>  A mocking fire:  "what other fire than he,</a>
<a id='line_8113'>  Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows,</a>
<a id='line_8114'>  And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?"</a>
<a id='line_8115'>  And when his answer chafed them, the rough crowd,</a>
<a id='line_8116'>  Hearing he had a difference with their priests,</a>
<a id='line_8117'>  Seized him, and bound and plunged him into a cell</a>
<a id='line_8118'>  Of great piled stones; and lying bounden there</a>
<a id='line_8119'>  In darkness through innumerable hours</a>
<a id='line_8120'>  He heard the hollow-ringing heavens sweep</a>
<a id='line_8121'>  Over him till by miracle--what else?--</a>
<a id='line_8122'>  Heavy as it was, a great stone slipt and fell,</a>
<a id='line_8123'>  Such as no wind could move:  and through the gap</a>
<a id='line_8124'>  Glimmered the streaming scud:  then came a night</a>
<a id='line_8125'>  Still as the day was loud; and through the gap</a>
<a id='line_8126'>  The seven clear stars of Arthur's Table Round--</a>
<a id='line_8127'>  For, brother, so one night, because they roll</a>
<a id='line_8128'>  Through such a round in heaven, we named the stars,</a>
<a id='line_8129'>  Rejoicing in ourselves and in our King--</a>
<a id='line_8130'>  And these, like bright eyes of familiar friends,</a>
<a id='line_8131'>  In on him shone:  "And then to me, to me,"</a>
<a id='line_8132'>  Said good Sir Bors, "beyond all hopes of mine,</a>
<a id='line_8133'>  Who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself--</a>
<a id='line_8134'>  Across the seven clear stars--O grace to me--</a>
<a id='line_8135'>  In colour like the fingers of a hand</a>
<a id='line_8136'>  Before a burning taper, the sweet Grail</a>
<a id='line_8137'>  Glided and past, and close upon it pealed</a>
<a id='line_8138'>  A sharp quick thunder."  Afterwards, a maid,</a>
<a id='line_8139'>  Who kept our holy faith among her kin</a>
<a id='line_8140'>  In secret, entering, loosed and let him go.'</a>
<a id='line_8141'></a>
<a id='line_8142'>     To whom the monk:  'And I remember now</a>
<a id='line_8143'>  That pelican on the casque:  Sir Bors it was</a>
<a id='line_8144'>  Who spake so low and sadly at our board;</a>
<a id='line_8145'>  And mighty reverent at our grace was he:</a>
<a id='line_8146'>  A square-set man and honest; and his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8147'>  An out-door sign of all the warmth within,</a>
<a id='line_8148'>  Smiled with his lips--a smile beneath a cloud,</a>
<a id='line_8149'>  But heaven had meant it for a sunny one:</a>
<a id='line_8150'>  Ay, ay, Sir Bors, who else?  But when ye reached</a>
<a id='line_8151'>  The city, found ye all your knights returned,</a>
<a id='line_8152'>  Or was there sooth in Arthur's prophecy,</a>
<a id='line_8153'>  Tell me, and what said each, and what the King?'</a>
<a id='line_8154'></a>
<a id='line_8155'>     Then answered Percivale:  'And that can I,</a>
<a id='line_8156'>  Brother, and truly; since the living words</a>
<a id='line_8157'>  Of so great men as Lancelot and our King</a>
<a id='line_8158'>  Pass not from door to door and out again,</a>
<a id='line_8159'>  But sit within the house.  O, when we reached</a>
<a id='line_8160'>  The city, our horses stumbling as they trode</a>
<a id='line_8161'>  On heaps of ruin, hornless unicorns,</a>
<a id='line_8162'>  Cracked basilisks, and splintered cockatrices,</a>
<a id='line_8163'>  And shattered talbots, which had left the stones</a>
<a id='line_8164'>  Raw, that they fell from, brought us to the hall.</a>
<a id='line_8165'></a>
<a id='line_8166'>     'And there sat Arthur on the dais-throne,</a>
<a id='line_8167'>  And those that had gone out upon the Quest,</a>
<a id='line_8168'>  Wasted and worn, and but a tithe of them,</a>
<a id='line_8169'>  And those that had not, stood before the King,</a>
<a id='line_8170'>  Who, when he saw me, rose, and bad me hail,</a>
<a id='line_8171'>  Saying, "A welfare in thine eye reproves</a>
<a id='line_8172'>  Our fear of some disastrous chance for thee</a>
<a id='line_8173'>  On hill, or plain, at sea, or flooding ford.</a>
<a id='line_8174'>  So fierce a gale made havoc here of late</a>
<a id='line_8175'>  Among the strange devices of our kings;</a>
<a id='line_8176'>  Yea, shook this newer, stronger hall of ours,</a>
<a id='line_8177'>  And from the statue Merlin moulded for us</a>
<a id='line_8178'>  Half-wrenched a golden wing; but now--the Quest,</a>
<a id='line_8179'>  This vision--hast thou seen the Holy Cup,</a>
<a id='line_8180'>  That Joseph brought of old to Glastonbury?"</a>
<a id='line_8181'></a>
<a id='line_8182'>     'So when I told him all thyself hast heard,</a>
<a id='line_8183'>  Ambrosius, and my fresh but fixt resolve</a>
<a id='line_8184'>  To pass away into the quiet life,</a>
<a id='line_8185'>  He answered not, but, sharply turning, asked</a>
<a id='line_8186'>  Of Gawain, "Gawain, was this Quest for thee?"</a>
<a id='line_8187'></a>
<a id='line_8188'>     '"Nay, lord," said Gawain, "not for such as I.</a>
<a id='line_8189'>  Therefore I communed with a saintly man,</a>
<a id='line_8190'>  Who made me sure the Quest was not for me;</a>
<a id='line_8191'>  For I was much awearied of the Quest:</a>
<a id='line_8192'>  But found a silk pavilion in a field,</a>
<a id='line_8193'>  And merry maidens in it; and then this gale</a>
<a id='line_8194'>  Tore my pavilion from the tenting-pin,</a>
<a id='line_8195'>  And blew my merry maidens all about</a>
<a id='line_8196'>  With all discomfort; yea, and but for this,</a>
<a id='line_8197'>  My twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me."</a>
<a id='line_8198'></a>
<a id='line_8199'>     'He ceased; and Arthur turned to whom at first</a>
<a id='line_8200'>  He saw not, for Sir Bors, on entering, pushed</a>
<a id='line_8201'>  Athwart the throng to Lancelot, caught his hand,</a>
<a id='line_8202'>  Held it, and there, half-hidden by him, stood,</a>
<a id='line_8203'>  Until the King espied him, saying to him,</a>
<a id='line_8204'>  "Hail, Bors! if ever loyal man and true</a>
<a id='line_8205'>  Could see it, thou hast seen the Grail;" and Bors,</a>
<a id='line_8206'>  "Ask me not, for I may not speak of it:</a>
<a id='line_8207'>  I saw it;" and the tears were in his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_8208'></a>
<a id='line_8209'>     'Then there remained but Lancelot, for the rest</a>
<a id='line_8210'>  Spake but of sundry perils in the storm;</a>
<a id='line_8211'>  Perhaps, like him of Cana in Holy Writ,</a>
<a id='line_8212'>  Our Arthur kept his best until the last;</a>
<a id='line_8213'>  "Thou, too, my Lancelot," asked the king, "my friend,</a>
<a id='line_8214'>  Our mightiest, hath this Quest availed for thee?"</a>
<a id='line_8215'></a>
<a id='line_8216'>     '"Our mightiest!" answered Lancelot, with a groan;</a>
<a id='line_8217'>  "O King!"--and when he paused, methought I spied</a>
<a id='line_8218'>  A dying fire of madness in his eyes--</a>
<a id='line_8219'>  "O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be,</a>
<a id='line_8220'>  Happier are those that welter in their sin,</a>
<a id='line_8221'>  Swine in the mud, that cannot see for slime,</a>
<a id='line_8222'>  Slime of the ditch:  but in me lived a sin</a>
<a id='line_8223'>  So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure,</a>
<a id='line_8224'>  Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung</a>
<a id='line_8225'>  Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower</a>
<a id='line_8226'>  And poisonous grew together, each as each,</a>
<a id='line_8227'>  Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights</a>
<a id='line_8228'>  Sware, I sware with them only in the hope</a>
<a id='line_8229'>  That could I touch or see the Holy Grail</a>
<a id='line_8230'>  They might be plucked asunder.  Then I spake</a>
<a id='line_8231'>  To one most holy saint, who wept and said,</a>
<a id='line_8232'>  That save they could be plucked asunder, all</a>
<a id='line_8233'>  My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed</a>
<a id='line_8234'>  That I would work according as he willed.</a>
<a id='line_8235'>  And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove</a>
<a id='line_8236'>  To tear the twain asunder in my heart,</a>
<a id='line_8237'>  My madness came upon me as of old,</a>
<a id='line_8238'>  And whipt me into waste fields far away;</a>
<a id='line_8239'>  There was I beaten down by little men,</a>
<a id='line_8240'>  Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword</a>
<a id='line_8241'>  And shadow of my spear had been enow</a>
<a id='line_8242'>  To scare them from me once; and then I came</a>
<a id='line_8243'>  All in my folly to the naked shore,</a>
<a id='line_8244'>  Wide flats, where nothing but coarse grasses grew;</a>
<a id='line_8245'>  But such a blast, my King, began to blow,</a>
<a id='line_8246'>  So loud a blast along the shore and sea,</a>
<a id='line_8247'>  Ye could not hear the waters for the blast,</a>
<a id='line_8248'>  Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea</a>
<a id='line_8249'>  Drove like a cataract, and all the sand</a>
<a id='line_8250'>  Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens</a>
<a id='line_8251'>  Were shaken with the motion and the sound.</a>
<a id='line_8252'>  And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat,</a>
<a id='line_8253'>  Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain;</a>
<a id='line_8254'>  And in my madness to myself I said,</a>
<a id='line_8255'>  'I will embark and I will lose myself,</a>
<a id='line_8256'>  And in the great sea wash away my sin.'</a>
<a id='line_8257'>  I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat.</a>
<a id='line_8258'>  Seven days I drove along the dreary deep,</a>
<a id='line_8259'>  And with me drove the moon and all the stars;</a>
<a id='line_8260'>  And the wind fell, and on the seventh night</a>
<a id='line_8261'>  I heard the shingle grinding in the surge,</a>
<a id='line_8262'>  And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up,</a>
<a id='line_8263'>  Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek,</a>
<a id='line_8264'>  A castle like a rock upon a rock,</a>
<a id='line_8265'>  With chasm-like portals open to the sea,</a>
<a id='line_8266'>  And steps that met the breaker! there was none</a>
<a id='line_8267'>  Stood near it but a lion on each side</a>
<a id='line_8268'>  That kept the entry, and the moon was full.</a>
<a id='line_8269'>  Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs.</a>
<a id='line_8270'>  There drew my sword.  With sudden-flaring manes</a>
<a id='line_8271'>  Those two great beasts rose upright like a man,</a>
<a id='line_8272'>  Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between;</a>
<a id='line_8273'>  And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice,</a>
<a id='line_8274'>  'Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts</a>
<a id='line_8275'>  Will tear thee piecemeal.'  Then with violence</a>
<a id='line_8276'>  The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell.</a>
<a id='line_8277'>  And up into the sounding hall I past;</a>
<a id='line_8278'>  But nothing in the sounding hall I saw,</a>
<a id='line_8279'>  No bench nor table, painting on the wall</a>
<a id='line_8280'>  Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon</a>
<a id='line_8281'>  Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea.</a>
<a id='line_8282'>  But always in the quiet house I heard,</a>
<a id='line_8283'>  Clear as a lark, high o'er me as a lark,</a>
<a id='line_8284'>  A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower</a>
<a id='line_8285'>  To the eastward:  up I climbed a thousand steps</a>
<a id='line_8286'>  With pain:  as in a dream I seemed to climb</a>
<a id='line_8287'>  For ever:  at the last I reached a door,</a>
<a id='line_8288'>  A light was in the crannies, and I heard,</a>
<a id='line_8289'>  'Glory and joy and honour to our Lord</a>
<a id='line_8290'>  And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail.'</a>
<a id='line_8291'>  Then in my madness I essayed the door;</a>
<a id='line_8292'>  It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat</a>
<a id='line_8293'>  As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I,</a>
<a id='line_8294'>  Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was,</a>
<a id='line_8295'>  With such a fierceness that I swooned away--</a>
<a id='line_8296'>  O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail,</a>
<a id='line_8297'>  All palled in crimson samite, and around</a>
<a id='line_8298'>  Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes.</a>
<a id='line_8299'>  And but for all my madness and my sin,</a>
<a id='line_8300'>  And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw</a>
<a id='line_8301'>  That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled</a>
<a id='line_8302'>  And covered; and this Quest was not for me."</a>
<a id='line_8303'></a>
<a id='line_8304'>     'So speaking, and here ceasing, Lancelot left</a>

<a id='line_8350'>  My greatest hardly will believe he saw;</a>
<a id='line_8351'>  Another hath beheld it afar off,</a>
<a id='line_8352'>  And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,</a>
<a id='line_8353'>  Cares but to pass into the silent life.</a>
<a id='line_8354'>  And one hath had the vision face to face,</a>
<a id='line_8355'>  And now his chair desires him here in vain,</a>
<a id='line_8356'>  However they may crown him otherwhere.</a>
<a id='line_8357'></a>
<a id='line_8358'>     '"And some among you held, that if the King</a>
<a id='line_8359'>  Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:</a>
<a id='line_8360'>  Not easily, seeing that the King must guard</a>
<a id='line_8361'>  That which he rules, and is but as the hind</a>
<a id='line_8362'>  To whom a space of land is given to plow.</a>
<a id='line_8363'>  Who may not wander from the allotted field</a>
<a id='line_8364'>  Before his work be done; but, being done,</a>
<a id='line_8365'>  Let visions of the night or of the day</a>
<a id='line_8366'>  Come, as they will; and many a time they come,</a>
<a id='line_8367'>  Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,</a>
<a id='line_8368'>  This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,</a>
<a id='line_8369'>  This air that smites his forehead is not air</a>
<a id='line_8370'>  But vision--yea, his very hand and foot--</a>
<a id='line_8371'>  In moments when he feels he cannot die,</a>
<a id='line_8372'>  And knows himself no vision to himself,</a>
<a id='line_8373'>  Nor the high God a vision, nor that One</a>
<a id='line_8374'>  Who rose again:  ye have seen what ye have seen."</a>
<a id='line_8375'></a>
<a id='line_8376'>     'So spake the King:  I knew not all he meant.'</a>
<a id='line_8377'></a>
<a id='line_8378'></a>
<a id='line_8379'></a>
<a id='line_8380'>  Pelleas and Ettarre</a>
<a id='line_8381'></a>
<a id='line_8382'>  King Arthur made new knights to fill the gap</a>
<a id='line_8383'>  Left by the Holy Quest; and as he sat</a>
<a id='line_8384'>  In hall at old Caerleon, the high doors</a>
<a id='line_8385'>  Were softly sundered, and through these a youth,</a>
<a id='line_8386'>  Pelleas, and the sweet smell of the fields</a>
<a id='line_8387'>  Past, and the sunshine came along with him.</a>
<a id='line_8388'></a>
<a id='line_8389'>     'Make me thy knight, because I know, Sir King,</a>
<a id='line_8390'>  All that belongs to knighthood, and I love.'</a>
<a id='line_8391'>  Such was his cry:  for having heard the King</a>
<a id='line_8392'>  Had let proclaim a tournament--the prize</a>
<a id='line_8393'>  A golden circlet and a knightly sword,</a>
<a id='line_8394'>  Full fain had Pelleas for his lady won</a>
<a id='line_8395'>  The golden circlet, for himself the sword:</a>
<a id='line_8396'>  And there were those who knew him near the King,</a>
<a id='line_8397'>  And promised for him:  and Arthur made him knight.</a>
<a id='line_8398'></a>
<a id='line_8399'>     And this new knight, Sir Pelleas of the isles--</a>
<a id='line_8400'>  But lately come to his inheritance,</a>
<a id='line_8401'>  And lord of many a barren isle was he--</a>
<a id='line_8402'>  Riding at noon, a day or twain before,</a>
<a id='line_8403'>  Across the forest called of Dean, to find</a>
<a id='line_8404'>  Caerleon and the King, had felt the sun</a>
<a id='line_8405'>  Beat like a strong knight on his helm, and reeled</a>
<a id='line_8406'>  Almost to falling from his horse; but saw</a>
<a id='line_8407'>  Near him a mound of even-sloping side,</a>
<a id='line_8408'>  Whereon a hundred stately beeches grew,</a>
<a id='line_8409'>  And here and there great hollies under them;</a>
<a id='line_8410'>  But for a mile all round was open space,</a>
<a id='line_8411'>  And fern and heath:  and slowly Pelleas drew</a>
<a id='line_8412'>  To that dim day, then binding his good horse</a>
<a id='line_8413'>  To a tree, cast himself down; and as he lay</a>
<a id='line_8414'>  At random looking over the brown earth</a>
<a id='line_8415'>  Through that green-glooming twilight of the grove,</a>
<a id='line_8416'>  It seemed to Pelleas that the fern without</a>
<a id='line_8417'>  Burnt as a living fire of emeralds,</a>
<a id='line_8418'>  So that his eyes were dazzled looking at it.</a>
<a id='line_8419'>  Then o'er it crost the dimness of a cloud</a>
<a id='line_8420'>  Floating, and once the shadow of a bird</a>
<a id='line_8421'>  Flying, and then a fawn; and his eyes closed.</a>
<a id='line_8422'>  And since he loved all maidens, but no maid</a>
<a id='line_8423'>  In special, half-awake he whispered, 'Where?</a>
<a id='line_8424'>  O where? I love thee, though I know thee not.</a>
<a id='line_8425'>  For fair thou art and pure as Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_8426'>  And I will make thee with my spear and sword</a>
<a id='line_8427'>  As famous--O my Queen, my Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_8428'>  For I will be thine Arthur when we meet.'</a>
<a id='line_8429'></a>
<a id='line_8430'>     Suddenly wakened with a sound of talk</a>
<a id='line_8431'>  And laughter at the limit of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_8432'>  And glancing through the hoary boles, he saw,</a>
<a id='line_8433'>  Strange as to some old prophet might have seemed</a>
<a id='line_8434'>  A vision hovering on a sea of fire,</a>
<a id='line_8435'>  Damsels in divers colours like the cloud</a>
<a id='line_8436'>  Of sunset and sunrise, and all of them</a>
<a id='line_8437'>  On horses, and the horses richly trapt</a>
<a id='line_8438'>  Breast-high in that bright line of bracken stood:</a>
<a id='line_8439'>  And all the damsels talked confusedly,</a>
<a id='line_8440'>  And one was pointing this way, and one that,</a>
<a id='line_8441'>  Because the way was lost.</a>
<a id='line_8442'></a>
<a id='line_8443'>                           And Pelleas rose,</a>
<a id='line_8444'>  And loosed his horse, and led him to the light.</a>
<a id='line_8445'>  There she that seemed the chief among them said,</a>
<a id='line_8446'>  'In happy time behold our pilot-star!</a>
<a id='line_8447'>  Youth, we are damsels-errant, and we ride,</a>
<a id='line_8448'>  Armed as ye see, to tilt against the knights</a>
<a id='line_8449'>  There at Caerleon, but have lost our way:</a>
<a id='line_8450'>  To right? to left? straight forward? back again?</a>
<a id='line_8451'>  Which? tell us quickly.'</a>
<a id='line_8452'></a>
<a id='line_8453'>                          Pelleas gazing thought,</a>
<a id='line_8454'>  'Is Guinevere herself so beautiful?'</a>
<a id='line_8455'>  For large her violet eyes looked, and her bloom</a>
<a id='line_8456'>  A rosy dawn kindled in stainless heavens,</a>
<a id='line_8457'>  And round her limbs, mature in womanhood;</a>
<a id='line_8458'>  And slender was her hand and small her shape;</a>
<a id='line_8459'>  And but for those large eyes, the haunts of scorn,</a>
<a id='line_8460'>  She might have seemed a toy to trifle with,</a>
<a id='line_8461'>  And pass and care no more.  But while he gazed</a>
<a id='line_8462'>  The beauty of her flesh abashed the boy,</a>
<a id='line_8463'>  As though it were the beauty of her soul:</a>
<a id='line_8464'>  For as the base man, judging of the good,</a>
<a id='line_8465'>  Puts his own baseness in him by default</a>
<a id='line_8466'>  Of will and nature, so did Pelleas lend</a>
<a id='line_8467'>  All the young beauty of his own soul to hers,</a>
<a id='line_8468'>  Believing her; and when she spake to him,</a>
<a id='line_8469'>  Stammered, and could not make her a reply.</a>
<a id='line_8470'>  For out of the waste islands had he come,</a>
<a id='line_8471'>  Where saving his own sisters he had known</a>
<a id='line_8472'>  Scarce any but the women of his isles,</a>
<a id='line_8473'>  Rough wives, that laughed and screamed against the gulls,</a>
<a id='line_8474'>  Makers of nets, and living from the sea.</a>
<a id='line_8475'></a>
<a id='line_8476'>     Then with a slow smile turned the lady round</a>
<a id='line_8477'>  And looked upon her people; and as when</a>
<a id='line_8478'>  A stone is flung into some sleeping tarn,</a>
<a id='line_8479'>  The circle widens till it lip the marge,</a>
<a id='line_8480'>  Spread the slow smile through all her company.</a>
<a id='line_8481'>  Three knights were thereamong; and they too smiled,</a>
<a id='line_8482'>  Scorning him; for the lady was Ettarre,</a>
<a id='line_8483'>  And she was a great lady in her land.</a>
<a id='line_8484'></a>
<a id='line_8485'>     Again she said, 'O wild and of the woods,</a>
<a id='line_8486'>  Knowest thou not the fashion of our speech?</a>
<a id='line_8487'>  Or have the Heavens but given thee a fair face,</a>
<a id='line_8488'>  Lacking a tongue?'</a>
<a id='line_8489'></a>
<a id='line_8490'>                    'O damsel,' answered he,</a>
<a id='line_8491'>  'I woke from dreams; and coming out of gloom</a>
<a id='line_8492'>  Was dazzled by the sudden light, and crave</a>
<a id='line_8493'>  Pardon:  but will ye to Caerleon?  I</a>
<a id='line_8494'>  Go likewise:  shall I lead you to the King?'</a>
<a id='line_8495'></a>
<a id='line_8496'>     'Lead then,' she said; and through the woods they went.</a>
<a id='line_8497'>  And while they rode, the meaning in his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8498'>  His tenderness of manner, and chaste awe,</a>
<a id='line_8499'>  His broken utterances and bashfulness,</a>
<a id='line_8500'>  Were all a burthen to her, and in her heart</a>
<a id='line_8501'>  She muttered, 'I have lighted on a fool,</a>
<a id='line_8502'>  Raw, yet so stale!'  But since her mind was bent</a>
<a id='line_8503'>  On hearing, after trumpet blown, her name</a>
<a id='line_8504'>  And title, 'Queen of Beauty,' in the lists</a>
<a id='line_8505'>  Cried--and beholding him so strong, she thought</a>
<a id='line_8506'>  That peradventure he will fight for me,</a>
<a id='line_8507'>  And win the circlet:  therefore flattered him,</a>
<a id='line_8508'>  Being so gracious, that he wellnigh deemed</a>
<a id='line_8509'>  His wish by hers was echoed; and her knights</a>
<a id='line_8510'>  And all her damsels too were gracious to him,</a>
<a id='line_8511'>  For she was a great lady.</a>
<a id='line_8512'></a>
<a id='line_8513'>                           And when they reached</a>
<a id='line_8514'>  Caerleon, ere they past to lodging, she,</a>
<a id='line_8515'>  Taking his hand, 'O the strong hand,' she said,</a>
<a id='line_8516'>  'See! look at mine! but wilt thou fight for me,</a>
<a id='line_8517'>  And win me this fine circlet, Pelleas,</a>
<a id='line_8518'>  That I may love thee?'</a>
<a id='line_8519'></a>
<a id='line_8520'>                        Then his helpless heart</a>
<a id='line_8521'>  Leapt, and he cried, 'Ay! wilt thou if I win?'</a>
<a id='line_8522'>  'Ay, that will I,' she answered, and she laughed,</a>
<a id='line_8523'>  And straitly nipt the hand, and flung it from her;</a>
<a id='line_8524'>  Then glanced askew at those three knights of hers,</a>
<a id='line_8525'>  Till all her ladies laughed along with her.</a>
<a id='line_8526'></a>
<a id='line_8527'>     'O happy world,' thought Pelleas, 'all, meseems,</a>
<a id='line_8528'>  Are happy; I the happiest of them all.'</a>
<a id='line_8529'>  Nor slept that night for pleasure in his blood,</a>
<a id='line_8530'>  And green wood-ways, and eyes among the leaves;</a>
<a id='line_8531'>  Then being on the morrow knighted, sware</a>
<a id='line_8532'>  To love one only.  And as he came away,</a>
<a id='line_8533'>  The men who met him rounded on their heels</a>
<a id='line_8534'>  And wondered after him, because his face</a>
<a id='line_8535'>  Shone like the countenance of a priest of old</a>
<a id='line_8536'>  Against the flame about a sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_8537'>  Kindled by fire from heaven:  so glad was he.</a>
<a id='line_8538'></a>
<a id='line_8539'>     Then Arthur made vast banquets, and strange knights</a>
<a id='line_8540'>  From the four winds came in:  and each one sat,</a>
<a id='line_8541'>  Though served with choice from air, land, stream, and sea,</a>
<a id='line_8542'>  Oft in mid-banquet measuring with his eyes</a>
<a id='line_8543'>  His neighbour's make and might:  and Pelleas looked</a>
<a id='line_8544'>  Noble among the noble, for he dreamed</a>
<a id='line_8545'>  His lady loved him, and he knew himself</a>
<a id='line_8546'>  Loved of the King:  and him his new-made knight</a>
<a id='line_8547'>  Worshipt, whose lightest whisper moved him more</a>
<a id='line_8548'>  Than all the ranged reasons of the world.</a>
<a id='line_8549'></a>
<a id='line_8550'>     Then blushed and brake the morning of the jousts,</a>
<a id='line_8551'>  And this was called 'The Tournament of Youth:'</a>
<a id='line_8552'>  For Arthur, loving his young knight, withheld</a>
<a id='line_8553'>  His older and his mightier from the lists,</a>
<a id='line_8554'>  That Pelleas might obtain his lady's love,</a>
<a id='line_8555'>  According to her promise, and remain</a>
<a id='line_8556'>  Lord of the tourney.  And Arthur had the jousts</a>
<a id='line_8557'>  Down in the flat field by the shore of Usk</a>
<a id='line_8558'>  Holden:  the gilded parapets were crowned</a>
<a id='line_8559'>  With faces, and the great tower filled with eyes</a>
<a id='line_8560'>  Up to the summit, and the trumpets blew.</a>
<a id='line_8561'>  There all day long Sir Pelleas kept the field</a>
<a id='line_8562'>  With honour:  so by that strong hand of his</a>
<a id='line_8563'>  The sword and golden circlet were achieved.</a>
<a id='line_8564'></a>
<a id='line_8565'>     Then rang the shout his lady loved:  the heat</a>
<a id='line_8566'>  Of pride and glory fired her face; her eye</a>
<a id='line_8567'>  Sparkled; she caught the circlet from his lance,</a>
<a id='line_8568'>  And there before the people crowned herself:</a>
<a id='line_8569'>  So for the last time she was gracious to him.</a>
<a id='line_8570'></a>
<a id='line_8571'>     Then at Caerleon for a space--her look</a>
<a id='line_8572'>  Bright for all others, cloudier on her knight--</a>
<a id='line_8573'>  Lingered Ettarre:  and seeing Pelleas droop,</a>
<a id='line_8574'>  Said Guinevere, 'We marvel at thee much,</a>
<a id='line_8575'>  O damsel, wearing this unsunny face</a>
<a id='line_8576'>  To him who won thee glory!'  And she said,</a>
<a id='line_8577'>  'Had ye not held your Lancelot in your bower,</a>
<a id='line_8578'>  My Queen, he had not won.'  Whereat the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_8579'>  As one whose foot is bitten by an ant,</a>
<a id='line_8580'>  Glanced down upon her, turned and went her way.</a>
<a id='line_8581'></a>
<a id='line_8582'>     But after, when her damsels, and herself,</a>
<a id='line_8583'>  And those three knights all set their faces home,</a>
<a id='line_8584'>  Sir Pelleas followed.  She that saw him cried,</a>
<a id='line_8585'>  'Damsels--and yet I should be shamed to say it--</a>
<a id='line_8586'>  I cannot bide Sir Baby.  Keep him back</a>
<a id='line_8587'>  Among yourselves.  Would rather that we had</a>
<a id='line_8588'>  Some rough old knight who knew the worldly way,</a>
<a id='line_8589'>  Albeit grizzlier than a bear, to ride</a>
<a id='line_8590'>  And jest with:  take him to you, keep him off,</a>
<a id='line_8591'>  And pamper him with papmeat, if ye will,</a>
<a id='line_8592'>  Old milky fables of the wolf and sheep,</a>
<a id='line_8593'>  Such as the wholesome mothers tell their boys.</a>
<a id='line_8594'>  Nay, should ye try him with a merry one</a>
<a id='line_8595'>  To find his mettle, good:  and if he fly us,</a>
<a id='line_8596'>  Small matter! let him.'  This her damsels heard,</a>
<a id='line_8597'>  And mindful of her small and cruel hand,</a>
<a id='line_8598'>  They, closing round him through the journey home,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>  Acted her hest, and always from her side</a>
<a id='line_8600'>  Restrained him with all manner of device,</a>
<a id='line_8601'>  So that he could not come to speech with her.</a>
<a id='line_8602'>  And when she gained her castle, upsprang the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_8603'>  Down rang the grate of iron through the groove,</a>
<a id='line_8604'>  And he was left alone in open field.</a>
<a id='line_8605'></a>
<a id='line_8606'>     'These be the ways of ladies,' Pelleas thought,</a>
<a id='line_8607'>  'To those who love them, trials of our faith.</a>
<a id='line_8608'>  Yea, let her prove me to the uttermost,</a>
<a id='line_8609'>  For loyal to the uttermost am I.'</a>
<a id='line_8610'>  So made his moan; and darkness falling, sought</a>
<a id='line_8611'>  A priory not far off, there lodged, but rose</a>
<a id='line_8612'>  With morning every day, and, moist or dry,</a>
<a id='line_8613'>  Full-armed upon his charger all day long</a>
<a id='line_8614'>  Sat by the walls, and no one opened to him.</a>
<a id='line_8615'></a>
<a id='line_8616'>     And this persistence turned her scorn to wrath.</a>
<a id='line_8617'>  Then calling her three knights, she charged them, 'Out!</a>
<a id='line_8618'>  And drive him from the walls.'  And out they came</a>
<a id='line_8619'>  But Pelleas overthrew them as they dashed</a>
<a id='line_8620'>  Against him one by one; and these returned,</a>
<a id='line_8621'>  But still he kept his watch beneath the wall.</a>
<a id='line_8622'></a>
<a id='line_8623'>     Thereon her wrath became a hate; and once,</a>
<a id='line_8624'>  A week beyond, while walking on the walls</a>
<a id='line_8625'>  With her three knights, she pointed downward, 'Look,</a>
<a id='line_8626'>  He haunts me--I cannot breathe--besieges me;</a>
<a id='line_8627'>  Down! strike him! put my hate into your strokes,</a>
<a id='line_8628'>  And drive him from my walls.'  And down they went,</a>
<a id='line_8629'>  And Pelleas overthrew them one by one;</a>
<a id='line_8630'>  And from the tower above him cried Ettarre,</a>
<a id='line_8631'>  'Bind him, and bring him in.'</a>
<a id='line_8632'></a>
<a id='line_8633'>                               He heard her voice;</a>
<a id='line_8634'>  Then let the strong hand, which had overthrown</a>
<a id='line_8635'>  Her minion-knights, by those he overthrew</a>
<a id='line_8636'>  Be bounden straight, and so they brought him in.</a>
<a id='line_8637'></a>
<a id='line_8638'>     Then when he came before Ettarre, the sight</a>
<a id='line_8639'>  Of her rich beauty made him at one glance</a>
<a id='line_8640'>  More bondsman in his heart than in his bonds.</a>
<a id='line_8641'>  Yet with good cheer he spake, 'Behold me, Lady,</a>
<a id='line_8642'>  A prisoner, and the vassal of thy will;</a>
<a id='line_8643'>  And if thou keep me in thy donjon here,</a>
<a id='line_8644'>  Content am I so that I see thy face</a>
<a id='line_8645'>  But once a day:  for I have sworn my vows,</a>
<a id='line_8646'>  And thou hast given thy promise, and I know</a>
<a id='line_8647'>  That all these pains are trials of my faith,</a>
<a id='line_8648'>  And that thyself, when thou hast seen me strained</a>
<a id='line_8649'>  And sifted to the utmost, wilt at length</a>
<a id='line_8650'>  Yield me thy love and know me for thy knight.'</a>
<a id='line_8651'></a>
<a id='line_8652'>     Then she began to rail so bitterly,</a>
<a id='line_8653'>  With all her damsels, he was stricken mute;</a>
<a id='line_8654'>  But when she mocked his vows and the great King,</a>
<a id='line_8655'>  Lighted on words:  'For pity of thine own self,</a>
<a id='line_8656'>  Peace, Lady, peace:  is he not thine and mine?'</a>
<a id='line_8657'>  'Thou fool,' she said, 'I never heard his voice</a>
<a id='line_8658'>  But longed to break away.  Unbind him now,</a>
<a id='line_8659'>  And thrust him out of doors; for save he be</a>
<a id='line_8660'>  Fool to the midmost marrow of his bones,</a>
<a id='line_8661'>  He will return no more.'  And those, her three,</a>
<a id='line_8662'>  Laughed, and unbound, and thrust him from the gate.</a>
<a id='line_8663'></a>
<a id='line_8664'>     And after this, a week beyond, again</a>
<a id='line_8665'>  She called them, saying, 'There he watches yet,</a>
<a id='line_8666'>  There like a dog before his master's door!</a>
<a id='line_8667'>  Kicked, he returns:  do ye not hate him, ye?</a>
<a id='line_8668'>  Ye know yourselves:  how can ye bide at peace,</a>
<a id='line_8669'>  Affronted with his fulsome innocence?</a>
<a id='line_8670'>  Are ye but creatures of the board and bed,</a>
<a id='line_8671'>  No men to strike?  Fall on him all at once,</a>
<a id='line_8672'>  And if ye slay him I reck not:  if ye fail,</a>
<a id='line_8673'>  Give ye the slave mine order to be bound,</a>
<a id='line_8674'>  Bind him as heretofore, and bring him in:</a>
<a id='line_8675'>  It may be ye shall slay him in his bonds.'</a>
<a id='line_8676'></a>
<a id='line_8677'>     She spake; and at her will they couched their spears,</a>
<a id='line_8678'>  Three against one:  and Gawain passing by,</a>
<a id='line_8679'>  Bound upon solitary adventure, saw</a>
<a id='line_8680'>  Low down beneath the shadow of those towers</a>
<a id='line_8681'>  A villainy, three to one:  and through his heart</a>
<a id='line_8682'>  The fire of honour and all noble deeds</a>
<a id='line_8683'>  Flashed, and he called, 'I strike upon thy side--</a>
<a id='line_8684'>  The caitiffs!'  'Nay,' said Pelleas, 'but forbear;</a>
<a id='line_8685'>  He needs no aid who doth his lady's will.'</a>
<a id='line_8686'></a>
<a id='line_8687'>     So Gawain, looking at the villainy done,</a>
<a id='line_8688'>  Forbore, but in his heat and eagerness</a>
<a id='line_8689'>  Trembled and quivered, as the dog, withheld</a>
<a id='line_8690'>  A moment from the vermin that he sees</a>
<a id='line_8691'>  Before him, shivers, ere he springs and kills.</a>
<a id='line_8692'></a>
<a id='line_8693'>     And Pelleas overthrew them, one to three;</a>
<a id='line_8694'>  And they rose up, and bound, and brought him in.</a>
<a id='line_8695'>  Then first her anger, leaving Pelleas, burned</a>
<a id='line_8696'>  Full on her knights in many an evil name</a>
<a id='line_8697'>  Of craven, weakling, and thrice-beaten hound:</a>
<a id='line_8698'>  'Yet, take him, ye that scarce are fit to touch,</a>
<a id='line_8699'>  Far less to bind, your victor, and thrust him out,</a>
<a id='line_8700'>  And let who will release him from his bonds.</a>
<a id='line_8701'>  And if he comes again'--there she brake short;</a>
<a id='line_8702'>  And Pelleas answered, 'Lady, for indeed</a>
<a id='line_8703'>  I loved you and I deemed you beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_8704'>  I cannot brook to see your beauty marred</a>
<a id='line_8705'>  Through evil spite:  and if ye love me not,</a>
<a id='line_8706'>  I cannot bear to dream you so forsworn:</a>
<a id='line_8707'>  I had liefer ye were worthy of my love,</a>
<a id='line_8708'>  Than to be loved again of you--farewell;</a>
<a id='line_8709'>  And though ye kill my hope, not yet my love,</a>
<a id='line_8710'>  Vex not yourself:  ye will not see me more.'</a>
<a id='line_8711'></a>
<a id='line_8712'>     While thus he spake, she gazed upon the man</a>
<a id='line_8713'>  Of princely bearing, though in bonds, and thought,</a>
<a id='line_8714'>  'Why have I pushed him from me? this man loves,</a>
<a id='line_8715'>  If love there be:  yet him I loved not.  Why?</a>
<a id='line_8716'>  I deemed him fool? yea, so? or that in him</a>
<a id='line_8717'>  A something--was it nobler than myself?</a>
<a id='line_8718'>  Seemed my reproach?  He is not of my kind.</a>
<a id='line_8719'>  He could not love me, did he know me well.</a>
<a id='line_8720'>  Nay, let him go--and quickly.'  And her knights</a>
<a id='line_8721'>  Laughed not, but thrust him bounden out of door.</a>
<a id='line_8722'></a>
<a id='line_8723'>     Forth sprang Gawain, and loosed him from his bonds,</a>
<a id='line_8724'>  And flung them o'er the walls; and afterward,</a>
<a id='line_8725'>  Shaking his hands, as from a lazar's rag,</a>
<a id='line_8726'>  'Faith of my body,' he said, 'and art thou not--</a>
<a id='line_8727'>  Yea thou art he, whom late our Arthur made</a>
<a id='line_8728'>  Knight of his table; yea and he that won</a>
<a id='line_8729'>  The circlet? wherefore hast thou so defamed</a>
<a id='line_8730'>  Thy brotherhood in me and all the rest,</a>
<a id='line_8731'>  As let these caitiffs on thee work their will?'</a>
<a id='line_8732'></a>
<a id='line_8733'>     And Pelleas answered, 'O, their wills are hers</a>
<a id='line_8734'>  For whom I won the circlet; and mine, hers,</a>
<a id='line_8735'>  Thus to be bounden, so to see her face,</a>
<a id='line_8736'>  Marred though it be with spite and mockery now,</a>
<a id='line_8737'>  Other than when I found her in the woods;</a>
<a id='line_8738'>  And though she hath me bounden but in spite,</a>
<a id='line_8739'>  And all to flout me, when they bring me in,</a>
<a id='line_8740'>  Let me be bounden, I shall see her face;</a>
<a id='line_8741'>  Else must I die through mine unhappiness.'</a>
<a id='line_8742'></a>
<a id='line_8743'>     And Gawain answered kindly though in scorn,</a>
<a id='line_8744'>  'Why, let my lady bind me if she will,</a>
<a id='line_8745'>  And let my lady beat me if she will:</a>
<a id='line_8746'>  But an she send her delegate to thrall</a>
<a id='line_8747'>  These fighting hands of mine--Christ kill me then</a>
<a id='line_8748'>  But I will slice him handless by the wrist,</a>
<a id='line_8749'>  And let my lady sear the stump for him,</a>
<a id='line_8750'>  Howl as he may.  But hold me for your friend:</a>
<a id='line_8751'>  Come, ye know nothing:  here I pledge my troth,</a>
<a id='line_8752'>  Yea, by the honour of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_8753'>  I will be leal to thee and work thy work,</a>
<a id='line_8754'>  And tame thy jailing princess to thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_8755'>  Lend me thine horse and arms, and I will say</a>
<a id='line_8756'>  That I have slain thee.  She will let me in</a>
<a id='line_8757'>  To hear the manner of thy fight and fall;</a>
<a id='line_8758'>  Then, when I come within her counsels, then</a>
<a id='line_8759'>  From prime to vespers will I chant thy praise</a>
<a id='line_8760'>  As prowest knight and truest lover, more</a>
<a id='line_8761'>  Than any have sung thee living, till she long</a>
<a id='line_8762'>  To have thee back in lusty life again,</a>
<a id='line_8763'>  Not to be bound, save by white bonds and warm,</a>
<a id='line_8764'>  Dearer than freedom.  Wherefore now thy horse</a>
<a id='line_8765'>  And armour:  let me go:  be comforted:</a>
<a id='line_8766'>  Give me three days to melt her fancy, and hope</a>
<a id='line_8767'>  The third night hence will bring thee news of gold.'</a>
<a id='line_8768'></a>
<a id='line_8769'>     Then Pelleas lent his horse and all his arms,</a>
<a id='line_8770'>  Saving the goodly sword, his prize, and took</a>
<a id='line_8771'>  Gawain's, and said, 'Betray me not, but help--</a>
<a id='line_8772'>  Art thou not he whom men call light-of-love?'</a>
<a id='line_8773'></a>
<a id='line_8774'>     'Ay,' said Gawain, 'for women be so light.'</a>
<a id='line_8775'>  Then bounded forward to the castle walls,</a>
<a id='line_8776'>  And raised a bugle hanging from his neck,</a>
<a id='line_8777'>  And winded it, and that so musically</a>
<a id='line_8778'>  That all the old echoes hidden in the wall</a>
<a id='line_8779'>  Rang out like hollow woods at hunting-tide.</a>
<a id='line_8780'></a>
<a id='line_8781'>     Up ran a score of damsels to the tower;</a>
<a id='line_8782'>  'Avaunt,' they cried, 'our lady loves thee not.'</a>
<a id='line_8783'>  But Gawain lifting up his vizor said,</a>
<a id='line_8784'>  'Gawain am I, Gawain of Arthur's court,</a>
<a id='line_8785'>  And I have slain this Pelleas whom ye hate:</a>
<a id='line_8786'>  Behold his horse and armour.  Open gates,</a>
<a id='line_8787'>  And I will make you merry.'</a>
<a id='line_8788'></a>
<a id='line_8789'>                             And down they ran,</a>
<a id='line_8790'>  Her damsels, crying to their lady, 'Lo!</a>
<a id='line_8791'>  Pelleas is dead--he told us--he that hath</a>
<a id='line_8792'>  His horse and armour:  will ye let him in?</a>
<a id='line_8793'>  He slew him!  Gawain, Gawain of the court,</a>
<a id='line_8794'>  Sir Gawain--there he waits below the wall,</a>
<a id='line_8795'>  Blowing his bugle as who should say him nay.'</a>
<a id='line_8796'></a>
<a id='line_8797'>     And so, leave given, straight on through open door</a>
<a id='line_8798'>  Rode Gawain, whom she greeted courteously.</a>
<a id='line_8799'>  'Dead, is it so?' she asked.  'Ay, ay,' said he,</a>
<a id='line_8800'>  'And oft in dying cried upon your name.'</a>
<a id='line_8801'>  'Pity on him,' she answered, 'a good knight,</a>
<a id='line_8802'>  But never let me bide one hour at peace.'</a>
<a id='line_8803'>  'Ay,' thought Gawain, 'and you be fair enow:</a>
<a id='line_8804'>  But I to your dead man have given my troth,</a>
<a id='line_8805'>  That whom ye loathe, him will I make you love.'</a>
<a id='line_8806'></a>
<a id='line_8807'>     So those three days, aimless about the land,</a>
<a id='line_8808'>  Lost in a doubt, Pelleas wandering</a>
<a id='line_8809'>  Waited, until the third night brought a moon</a>
<a id='line_8810'>  With promise of large light on woods and ways.</a>
<a id='line_8811'></a>
<a id='line_8812'>     Hot was the night and silent; but a sound</a>
<a id='line_8813'>  Of Gawain ever coming, and this lay--</a>
<a id='line_8814'>  Which Pelleas had heard sung before the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_8815'>  And seen her sadden listening--vext his heart,</a>
<a id='line_8816'>  And marred his rest--'A worm within the rose.'</a>
<a id='line_8817'></a>
<a id='line_8818'>     'A rose, but one, none other rose had I,</a>
<a id='line_8819'>  A rose, one rose, and this was wondrous fair,</a>
<a id='line_8820'>  One rose, a rose that gladdened earth and sky,</a>
<a id='line_8821'>  One rose, my rose, that sweetened all mine air--</a>
<a id='line_8822'>  I cared not for the thorns; the thorns were there.</a>
<a id='line_8823'></a>
<a id='line_8824'>     'One rose, a rose to gather by and by,</a>
<a id='line_8825'>  One rose, a rose, to gather and to wear,</a>
<a id='line_8826'>  No rose but one--what other rose had I?</a>
<a id='line_8827'>  One rose, my rose; a rose that will not die,--</a>
<a id='line_8828'>  He dies who loves it,--if the worm be there.'</a>
<a id='line_8829'></a>
<a id='line_8830'>     This tender rhyme, and evermore the doubt,</a>
<a id='line_8831'>  'Why lingers Gawain with his golden news?'</a>
<a id='line_8832'>  So shook him that he could not rest, but rode</a>
<a id='line_8833'>  Ere midnight to her walls, and bound his horse</a>
<a id='line_8834'>  Hard by the gates.  Wide open were the gates,</a>
<a id='line_8835'>  And no watch kept; and in through these he past,</a>
<a id='line_8836'>  And heard but his own steps, and his own heart</a>
<a id='line_8837'>  Beating, for nothing moved but his own self,</a>
<a id='line_8838'>  And his own shadow.  Then he crost the court,</a>
<a id='line_8839'>  And spied not any light in hall or bower,</a>
<a id='line_8840'>  But saw the postern portal also wide</a>
<a id='line_8841'>  Yawning; and up a slope of garden, all</a>
<a id='line_8842'>  Of roses white and red, and brambles mixt</a>
<a id='line_8843'>  And overgrowing them, went on, and found,</a>
<a id='line_8844'>  Here too, all hushed below the mellow moon,</a>
<a id='line_8845'>  Save that one rivulet from a tiny cave</a>
<a id='line_8846'>  Came lightening downward, and so spilt itself</a>
<a id='line_8847'>  Among the roses, and was lost again.</a>
<a id='line_8848'></a>
<a id='line_8849'>     Then was he ware of three pavilions reared</a>
<a id='line_8850'>  Above the bushes, gilden-peakt:  in one,</a>
<a id='line_8851'>  Red after revel, droned her lurdane knights</a>
<a id='line_8852'>  Slumbering, and their three squires across their feet:</a>
<a id='line_8853'>  In one, their malice on the placid lip</a>
<a id='line_8854'>  Frozen by sweet sleep, four of her damsels lay:</a>
<a id='line_8855'>  And in the third, the circlet of the jousts</a>
<a id='line_8856'>  Bound on her brow, were Gawain and Ettarre.</a>
<a id='line_8857'></a>
<a id='line_8858'>     Back, as a hand that pushes through the leaf</a>
<a id='line_8859'>  To find a nest and feels a snake, he drew:</a>
<a id='line_8860'>  Back, as a coward slinks from what he fears</a>
<a id='line_8861'>  To cope with, or a traitor proven, or hound</a>
<a id='line_8862'>  Beaten, did Pelleas in an utter shame</a>
<a id='line_8863'>  Creep with his shadow through the court again,</a>
<a id='line_8864'>  Fingering at his sword-handle until he stood</a>
<a id='line_8865'>  There on the castle-bridge once more, and thought,</a>
<a id='line_8866'>  'I will go back, and slay them where they lie.'</a>
<a id='line_8867'></a>
<a id='line_8868'>     And so went back, and seeing them yet in sleep</a>
<a id='line_8869'>  Said, 'Ye, that so dishallow the holy sleep,</a>
<a id='line_8870'>  Your sleep is death,' and drew the sword, and thought,</a>
<a id='line_8871'>  'What! slay a sleeping knight? the King hath bound</a>
<a id='line_8872'>  And sworn me to this brotherhood;' again,</a>
<a id='line_8873'>  'Alas that ever a knight should be so false.'</a>
<a id='line_8874'>  Then turned, and so returned, and groaning laid</a>
<a id='line_8875'>  The naked sword athwart their naked throats,</a>
<a id='line_8876'>  There left it, and them sleeping; and she lay,</a>
<a id='line_8877'>  The circlet of her tourney round her brows,</a>
<a id='line_8878'>  And the sword of the tourney across her throat.</a>
<a id='line_8879'></a>
<a id='line_8880'>     And forth he past, and mounting on his horse</a>
<a id='line_8881'>  Stared at her towers that, larger than themselves</a>
<a id='line_8882'>  In their own darkness, thronged into the moon.</a>
<a id='line_8883'>  Then crushed the saddle with his thighs, and clenched</a>
<a id='line_8884'>  His hands, and maddened with himself and moaned:</a>
<a id='line_8885'></a>
<a id='line_8886'>     'Would they have risen against me in their blood</a>
<a id='line_8887'>  At the last day?  I might have answered them</a>
<a id='line_8888'>  Even before high God.  O towers so strong,</a>
<a id='line_8889'>  Huge, solid, would that even while I gaze</a>
<a id='line_8890'>  The crack of earthquake shivering to your base</a>
<a id='line_8891'>  Split you, and Hell burst up your harlot roofs</a>
<a id='line_8892'>  Bellowing, and charred you through and through within,</a>
<a id='line_8893'>  Black as the harlot's heart--hollow as a skull!</a>
<a id='line_8894'>  Let the fierce east scream through your eyelet-holes,</a>
<a id='line_8895'>  And whirl the dust of harlots round and round</a>
<a id='line_8896'>  In dung and nettles! hiss, snake--I saw him there--</a>
<a id='line_8897'>  Let the fox bark, let the wolf yell.  Who yells</a>
<a id='line_8898'>  Here in the still sweet summer night, but I--</a>
<a id='line_8899'>  I, the poor Pelleas whom she called her fool?</a>
<a id='line_8900'>  Fool, beast--he, she, or I? myself most fool;</a>
<a id='line_8901'>  Beast too, as lacking human wit--disgraced,</a>
<a id='line_8902'>  Dishonoured all for trial of true love--</a>
<a id='line_8903'>  Love?--we be all alike:  only the King</a>
<a id='line_8904'>  Hath made us fools and liars.  O noble vows!</a>
<a id='line_8905'>  O great and sane and simple race of brutes</a>
<a id='line_8906'>  That own no lust because they have no law!</a>
<a id='line_8907'>  For why should I have loved her to my shame?</a>
<a id='line_8908'>  I loathe her, as I loved her to my shame.</a>
<a id='line_8909'>  I never loved her, I but lusted for her--</a>
<a id='line_8910'>  Away--'</a>
<a id='line_8911'>         He dashed the rowel into his horse,</a>
<a id='line_8912'>  And bounded forth and vanished through the night.</a>
<a id='line_8913'></a>
<a id='line_8914'>     Then she, that felt the cold touch on her throat,</a>
<a id='line_8915'>  Awaking knew the sword, and turned herself</a>
<a id='line_8916'>  To Gawain:  'Liar, for thou hast not slain</a>
<a id='line_8917'>  This Pelleas! here he stood, and might have slain</a>
<a id='line_8918'>  Me and thyself.'  And he that tells the tale</a>
<a id='line_8919'>  Says that her ever-veering fancy turned</a>
<a id='line_8920'>  To Pelleas, as the one true knight on earth,</a>
<a id='line_8921'>  And only lover; and through her love her life</a>
<a id='line_8922'>  Wasted and pined, desiring him in vain.</a>
<a id='line_8923'></a>
<a id='line_8924'>     But he by wild and way, for half the night,</a>
<a id='line_8925'>  And over hard and soft, striking the sod</a>
<a id='line_8926'>  From out the soft, the spark from off the hard,</a>
<a id='line_8927'>  Rode till the star above the wakening sun,</a>
<a id='line_8928'>  Beside that tower where Percivale was cowled,</a>
<a id='line_8929'>  Glanced from the rosy forehead of the dawn.</a>
<a id='line_8930'>  For so the words were flashed into his heart</a>
<a id='line_8931'>  He knew not whence or wherefore:  'O sweet star,</a>
<a id='line_8932'>  Pure on the virgin forehead of the dawn!'</a>
<a id='line_8933'>  And there he would have wept, but felt his eyes</a>
<a id='line_8934'>  Harder and drier than a fountain bed</a>
<a id='line_8935'>  In summer:  thither came the village girls</a>
<a id='line_8936'>  And lingered talking, and they come no more</a>
<a id='line_8937'>  Till the sweet heavens have filled it from the heights</a>
<a id='line_8938'>  Again with living waters in the change</a>
<a id='line_8939'>  Of seasons:  hard his eyes; harder his heart</a>
<a id='line_8940'>  Seemed; but so weary were his limbs, that he,</a>
<a id='line_8941'>  Gasping, 'Of Arthur's hall am I, but here,</a>
<a id='line_8942'>  Here let me rest and die,' cast himself down,</a>
<a id='line_8943'>  And gulfed his griefs in inmost sleep; so lay,</a>
<a id='line_8944'>  Till shaken by a dream, that Gawain fired</a>
<a id='line_8945'>  The hall of Merlin, and the morning star</a>
<a id='line_8946'>  Reeled in the smoke, brake into flame, and fell.</a>
<a id='line_8947'></a>
<a id='line_8948'>     He woke, and being ware of some one nigh,</a>
<a id='line_8949'>  Sent hands upon him, as to tear him, crying,</a>
<a id='line_8950'>  'False! and I held thee pure as Guinevere.'</a>
<a id='line_8951'></a>
<a id='line_8952'>     But Percivale stood near him and replied,</a>
<a id='line_8953'>  'Am I but false as Guinevere is pure?</a>
<a id='line_8954'>  Or art thou mazed with dreams? or being one</a>
<a id='line_8955'>  Of our free-spoken Table hast not heard</a>
<a id='line_8956'>  That Lancelot'--there he checked himself and paused.</a>
<a id='line_8957'></a>
<a id='line_8958'>     Then fared it with Sir Pelleas as with one</a>
<a id='line_8959'>  Who gets a wound in battle, and the sword</a>
<a id='line_8960'>  That made it plunges through the wound again,</a>
<a id='line_8961'>  And pricks it deeper:  and he shrank and wailed,</a>
<a id='line_8962'>  'Is the Queen false?' and Percivale was mute.</a>
<a id='line_8963'>  'Have any of our Round Table held their vows?'</a>
<a id='line_8964'>  And Percivale made answer not a word.</a>
<a id='line_8965'>  'Is the King true?'  'The King!' said Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_8966'>  'Why then let men couple at once with wolves.</a>
<a id='line_8967'>  What! art thou mad?'</a>
<a id='line_8968'></a>
<a id='line_8969'>                      But Pelleas, leaping up,</a>
<a id='line_8970'>  Ran through the doors and vaulted on his horse</a>
<a id='line_8971'>  And fled:  small pity upon his horse had he,</a>
<a id='line_8972'>  Or on himself, or any, and when he met</a>
<a id='line_8973'>  A cripple, one that held a hand for alms--</a>
<a id='line_8974'>  Hunched as he was, and like an old dwarf-elm</a>
<a id='line_8975'>  That turns its back upon the salt blast, the boy</a>
<a id='line_8976'>  Paused not, but overrode him, shouting, 'False,</a>
<a id='line_8977'>  And false with Gawain!' and so left him bruised</a>
<a id='line_8978'>  And battered, and fled on, and hill and wood</a>
<a id='line_8979'>  Went ever streaming by him till the gloom,</a>
<a id='line_8980'>  That follows on the turning of the world,</a>
<a id='line_8981'>  Darkened the common path:  he twitched the reins,</a>
<a id='line_8982'>  And made his beast that better knew it, swerve</a>
<a id='line_8983'>  Now off it and now on; but when he saw</a>
<a id='line_8984'>  High up in heaven the hall that Merlin built,</a>
<a id='line_8985'>  Blackening against the dead-green stripes of even,</a>
<a id='line_8986'>  'Black nest of rats,' he groaned, 'ye build too high.'</a>
<a id='line_8987'></a>
<a id='line_8988'>     Not long thereafter from the city gates</a>
<a id='line_8989'>  Issued Sir Lancelot riding airily,</a>
<a id='line_8990'>  Warm with a gracious parting from the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_8991'>  Peace at his heart, and gazing at a star</a>
<a id='line_8992'>  And marvelling what it was:  on whom the boy,</a>
<a id='line_8993'>  Across the silent seeded meadow-grass</a>
<a id='line_8994'>  Borne, clashed:  and Lancelot, saying, 'What name hast thou</a>
<a id='line_8995'>  That ridest here so blindly and so hard?'</a>
<a id='line_8996'>  'No name, no name,' he shouted, 'a scourge am I</a>
<a id='line_8997'>  To lash the treasons of the Table Round.'</a>
<a id='line_8998'>  'Yea, but thy name?'  'I have many names,' he cried:</a>
<a id='line_8999'>  'I am wrath and shame and hate and evil fame,</a>
<a id='line_9000'>  And like a poisonous wind I pass to blast</a>
<a id='line_9001'>  And blaze the crime of Lancelot and the Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_9002'>  'First over me,' said Lancelot, 'shalt thou pass.'</a>
<a id='line_9003'>  'Fight therefore,' yelled the youth, and either knight</a>
<a id='line_9004'>  Drew back a space, and when they closed, at once</a>
<a id='line_9005'>  The weary steed of Pelleas floundering flung</a>
<a id='line_9006'>  His rider, who called out from the dark field,</a>
<a id='line_9007'>  'Thou art as false as Hell:  slay me:  I have no sword.'</a>
<a id='line_9008'>  Then Lancelot, 'Yea, between thy lips--and sharp;</a>
<a id='line_9009'>  But here I will disedge it by thy death.'</a>
<a id='line_9010'>  'Slay then,' he shrieked, 'my will is to be slain,'</a>
<a id='line_9011'>  And Lancelot, with his heel upon the fallen,</a>
<a id='line_9012'>  Rolling his eyes, a moment stood, then spake:</a>
<a id='line_9013'>  'Rise, weakling; I am Lancelot; say thy say.'</a>
<a id='line_9014'></a>
<a id='line_9015'>     And Lancelot slowly rode his warhorse back</a>
<a id='line_9016'>  To Camelot, and Sir Pelleas in brief while</a>
<a id='line_9017'>  Caught his unbroken limbs from the dark field,</a>
<a id='line_9018'>  And followed to the city.  It chanced that both</a>
<a id='line_9019'>  Brake into hall together, worn and pale.</a>
<a id='line_9020'>  There with her knights and dames was Guinevere.</a>
<a id='line_9021'>  Full wonderingly she gazed on Lancelot</a>
<a id='line_9022'>  So soon returned, and then on Pelleas, him</a>
<a id='line_9023'>  Who had not greeted her, but cast himself</a>
<a id='line_9024'>  Down on a bench, hard-breathing.  'Have ye fought?'</a>
<a id='line_9025'>  She asked of Lancelot.  'Ay, my Queen,' he said.</a>
<a id='line_9026'>  'And hast thou overthrown him?'  'Ay, my Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_9027'>  Then she, turning to Pelleas, 'O young knight,</a>
<a id='line_9028'>  Hath the great heart of knighthood in thee failed</a>
<a id='line_9029'>  So far thou canst not bide, unfrowardly,</a>
<a id='line_9030'>  A fall from him?'  Then, for he answered not,</a>
<a id='line_9031'>  'Or hast thou other griefs?  If I, the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_9032'>  May help them, loose thy tongue, and let me know.'</a>
<a id='line_9033'>  But Pelleas lifted up an eye so fierce</a>
<a id='line_9034'>  She quailed; and he, hissing 'I have no sword,'</a>
<a id='line_9035'>  Sprang from the door into the dark.  The Queen</a>
<a id='line_9036'>  Looked hard upon her lover, he on her;</a>
<a id='line_9037'>  And each foresaw the dolorous day to be:</a>
<a id='line_9038'>  And all talk died, as in a grove all song</a>
<a id='line_9039'>  Beneath the shadow of some bird of prey;</a>
<a id='line_9040'>  Then a long silence came upon the hall,</a>
<a id='line_9041'>  And Modred thought, 'The time is hard at hand.'</a>
<a id='line_9042'></a>
<a id='line_9043'></a>
<a id='line_9044'></a>
<a id='line_9045'>  The Last Tournament</a>
<a id='line_9046'></a>
<a id='line_9047'>  Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood</a>
<a id='line_9048'>  Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_9049'>  At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,</a>
<a id='line_9050'>  Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.</a>
<a id='line_9051'>  And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,</a>
<a id='line_9052'>  And from the crown thereof a carcanet</a>
<a id='line_9053'>  Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize</a>
<a id='line_9054'>  Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,</a>
<a id='line_9055'>  Came Tristram, saying, 'Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'</a>
<a id='line_9056'></a>
<a id='line_9057'>     For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once</a>
<a id='line_9058'>  Far down beneath a winding wall of rock</a>
<a id='line_9059'>  Heard a child wail.  A stump of oak half-dead,</a>
<a id='line_9060'>  From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,</a>
<a id='line_9061'>  Clutched at the crag, and started through mid air</a>
<a id='line_9062'>  Bearing an eagle's nest:  and through the tree</a>
<a id='line_9063'>  Rushed ever a rainy wind, and through the wind</a>
<a id='line_9064'>  Pierced ever a child's cry:  and crag and tree</a>
<a id='line_9065'>  Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,</a>
<a id='line_9066'>  This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,</a>
<a id='line_9067'>  And all unscarred from beak or talon, brought</a>
<a id='line_9068'>  A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,</a>
<a id='line_9069'>  Then gave it to his Queen to rear:  the Queen</a>
<a id='line_9070'>  But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms</a>
<a id='line_9071'>  Received, and after loved it tenderly,</a>
<a id='line_9072'>  And named it Nestling; so forgot herself</a>
<a id='line_9073'>  A moment, and her cares; till that young life</a>
<a id='line_9074'>  Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold</a>
<a id='line_9075'>  Past from her; and in time the carcanet</a>
<a id='line_9076'>  Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:</a>
<a id='line_9077'>  So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,</a>
<a id='line_9078'>  'Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,</a>
<a id='line_9079'>  And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize.'</a>
<a id='line_9080'></a>
<a id='line_9081'>     To whom the King, 'Peace to thine eagle-borne</a>
<a id='line_9082'>  Dead nestling, and this honour after death,</a>
<a id='line_9083'>  Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse</a>
<a id='line_9084'>  Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone</a>
<a id='line_9085'>  Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,</a>
<a id='line_9086'>  And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear.'</a>
<a id='line_9087'></a>
<a id='line_9088'>     'Would rather you had let them fall,' she cried,</a>
<a id='line_9089'>  'Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,</a>
<a id='line_9090'>  A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,</a>
<a id='line_9091'>  Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--</a>
<a id='line_9092'>  Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out</a>
<a id='line_9093'>  Above the river--that unhappy child</a>
<a id='line_9094'>  Past in her barge:  but rosier luck will go</a>
<a id='line_9095'>  With these rich jewels, seeing that they came</a>
<a id='line_9096'>  Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,</a>
<a id='line_9097'>  But the sweet body of a maiden babe.</a>
<a id='line_9098'>  Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights</a>
<a id='line_9099'>  May win them for the purest of my maids.'</a>
<a id='line_9100'></a>
<a id='line_9101'>     She ended, and the cry of a great jousts</a>
<a id='line_9102'>  With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways</a>
<a id='line_9103'>  From Camelot in among the faded fields</a>
<a id='line_9104'>  To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights</a>
<a id='line_9105'>  Armed for a day of glory before the King.</a>
<a id='line_9106'></a>
<a id='line_9107'>     But on the hither side of that loud morn</a>
<a id='line_9108'>  Into the hall staggered, his visage ribbed</a>
<a id='line_9109'>  From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose</a>
<a id='line_9110'>  Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,</a>
<a id='line_9111'>  And one with shattered fingers dangling lame,</a>
<a id='line_9112'>  A churl, to whom indignantly the King,</a>
<a id='line_9113'></a>
<a id='line_9114'>     'My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast</a>
<a id='line_9115'>  Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?</a>
<a id='line_9116'>  Man was it who marred heaven's image in thee thus?'</a>
<a id='line_9117'></a>
<a id='line_9118'>     Then, sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth,</a>
<a id='line_9119'>  Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump</a>
<a id='line_9120'>  Pitch-blackened sawing the air, said the maimed churl,</a>
<a id='line_9121'></a>
<a id='line_9122'>     'He took them and he drave them to his tower--</a>
<a id='line_9123'>  Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--</a>
<a id='line_9124'>  A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--</a>
<a id='line_9125'>  Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight</a>
<a id='line_9126'>  Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;</a>
<a id='line_9127'>  And when I called upon thy name as one</a>
<a id='line_9128'>  That doest right by gentle and by churl,</a>
<a id='line_9129'>  Maimed me and mauled, and would outright have slain,</a>
<a id='line_9130'>  Save that he sware me to a message, saying,</a>
<a id='line_9131'>  "Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I</a>
<a id='line_9132'>  Have founded my Round Table in the North,</a>
<a id='line_9133'>  And whatsoever his own knights have sworn</a>
<a id='line_9134'>  My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say</a>
<a id='line_9135'>  My tower is full of harlots, like his court,</a>
<a id='line_9136'>  But mine are worthier, seeing they profess</a>
<a id='line_9137'>  To be none other than themselves--and say</a>
<a id='line_9138'>  My knights are all adulterers like his own,</a>
<a id='line_9139'>  But mine are truer, seeing they profess</a>
<a id='line_9140'>  To be none other; and say his hour is come,</a>
<a id='line_9141'>  The heathen are upon him, his long lance</a>
<a id='line_9142'>  Broken, and his Excalibur a straw."'</a>
<a id='line_9143'></a>
<a id='line_9144'>     Then Arthur turned to Kay the seneschal,</a>
<a id='line_9145'>  'Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously</a>
<a id='line_9146'>  Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.</a>
<a id='line_9147'>  The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,</a>
<a id='line_9148'>  Hurled back again so often in empty foam,</a>
<a id='line_9149'>  Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,</a>
<a id='line_9150'>  Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom</a>
<a id='line_9151'>  The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,</a>
<a id='line_9152'>  Friends, through your manhood and your fealty,--now</a>
<a id='line_9153'>  Make their last head like Satan in the North.</a>
<a id='line_9154'>  My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower</a>
<a id='line_9155'>  Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,</a>
<a id='line_9156'>  Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,</a>
<a id='line_9157'>  The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.</a>
<a id='line_9158'>  But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place</a>
<a id='line_9159'>  Enchaired tomorrow, arbitrate the field;</a>
<a id='line_9160'>  For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,</a>
<a id='line_9161'>  Only to yield my Queen her own again?</a>
<a id='line_9162'>  Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent:  is it well?'</a>
<a id='line_9163'></a>
<a id='line_9164'>     Thereto Sir Lancelot answered, 'It is well:</a>
<a id='line_9165'>  Yet better if the King abide, and leave</a>
<a id='line_9166'>  The leading of his younger knights to me.</a>
<a id='line_9167'>  Else, for the King has willed it, it is well.'</a>
<a id='line_9168'></a>
<a id='line_9169'>     Then Arthur rose and Lancelot followed him,</a>
<a id='line_9170'>  And while they stood without the doors, the King</a>
<a id='line_9171'>  Turned to him saying, 'Is it then so well?</a>
<a id='line_9172'>  Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he</a>
<a id='line_9173'>  Of whom was written, "A sound is in his ears"?</a>
<a id='line_9174'>  The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance</a>
<a id='line_9175'>  That only seems half-loyal to command,--</a>
<a id='line_9176'>  A manner somewhat fallen from reverence--</a>
<a id='line_9177'>  Or have I dreamed the bearing of our knights</a>
<a id='line_9178'>  Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?</a>
<a id='line_9179'>  Or whence the fear lest this my realm, upreared,</a>
<a id='line_9180'>  By noble deeds at one with noble vows,</a>
<a id='line_9181'>  From flat confusion and brute violences,</a>
<a id='line_9182'>  Reel back into the beast, and be no more?'</a>
<a id='line_9183'></a>
<a id='line_9184'>     He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,</a>
<a id='line_9185'>  Down the slope city rode, and sharply turned</a>
<a id='line_9186'>  North by the gate.  In her high bower the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_9187'>  Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,</a>
<a id='line_9188'>  Watched her lord pass, and knew not that she sighed.</a>
<a id='line_9189'>  Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme</a>
<a id='line_9190'>  Of bygone Merlin, 'Where is he who knows?</a>
<a id='line_9191'>  From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'</a>
<a id='line_9192'></a>
<a id='line_9193'>     But when the morning of a tournament,</a>
<a id='line_9194'>  By these in earnest those in mockery called</a>
<a id='line_9195'>  The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,</a>
<a id='line_9196'>  Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,</a>
<a id='line_9197'>  Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,</a>
<a id='line_9198'>  The words of Arthur flying shrieked, arose,</a>
<a id='line_9199'>  And down a streetway hung with folds of pure</a>
<a id='line_9200'>  White samite, and by fountains running wine,</a>
<a id='line_9201'>  Where children sat in white with cups of gold,</a>
<a id='line_9202'>  Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps</a>
<a id='line_9203'>  Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.</a>
<a id='line_9204'></a>
<a id='line_9205'>     He glanced and saw the stately galleries,</a>
<a id='line_9206'>  Dame, damsel, each through worship of their Queen</a>
<a id='line_9207'>  White-robed in honour of the stainless child,</a>
<a id='line_9208'>  And some with scattered jewels, like a bank</a>
<a id='line_9209'>  Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.</a>
<a id='line_9210'>  He looked but once, and vailed his eyes again.</a>
<a id='line_9211'></a>
<a id='line_9212'>     The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream</a>
<a id='line_9213'>  To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll</a>
<a id='line_9214'>  Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:</a>
<a id='line_9215'>  And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf</a>
<a id='line_9216'>  And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume</a>
<a id='line_9217'>  Went down it.  Sighing weariedly, as one</a>
<a id='line_9218'>  Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,</a>
<a id='line_9219'>  When all the goodlier guests are past away,</a>
<a id='line_9220'>  Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.</a>
<a id='line_9221'>  He saw the laws that ruled the tournament</a>
<a id='line_9222'>  Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down</a>
<a id='line_9223'>  Before his throne of arbitration cursed</a>
<a id='line_9224'>  The dead babe and the follies of the King;</a>
<a id='line_9225'>  And once the laces of a helmet cracked,</a>
<a id='line_9226'>  And showed him, like a vermin in its hole,</a>
<a id='line_9227'>  Modred, a narrow face:  anon he heard</a>
<a id='line_9228'>  The voice that billowed round the barriers roar</a>
<a id='line_9229'>  An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,</a>
<a id='line_9230'>  But newly-entered, taller than the rest,</a>
<a id='line_9231'>  And armoured all in forest green, whereon</a>
<a id='line_9232'>  There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,</a>
<a id='line_9233'>  And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,</a>
<a id='line_9234'>  With ever-scattering berries, and on shield</a>
<a id='line_9235'>  A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late</a>
<a id='line_9236'>  From overseas in Brittany returned,</a>
<a id='line_9237'>  And marriage with a princess of that realm,</a>
<a id='line_9238'>  Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--</a>
<a id='line_9239'>  Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain</a>
<a id='line_9240'>  His own against him, and now yearned to shake</a>
<a id='line_9241'>  The burthen off his heart in one full shock</a>
<a id='line_9242'>  With Tristram even to death:  his strong hands gript</a>
<a id='line_9243'>  And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,</a>
<a id='line_9244'>  Until he groaned for wrath--so many of those,</a>
<a id='line_9245'>  That ware their ladies' colours on the casque,</a>
<a id='line_9246'>  Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,</a>
<a id='line_9247'>  And there with gibes and flickering mockeries</a>
<a id='line_9248'>  Stood, while he muttered, 'Craven crests!  O shame!</a>
<a id='line_9249'>  What faith have these in whom they sware to love?</a>
<a id='line_9250'>  The glory of our Round Table is no more.'</a>
<a id='line_9251'></a>
<a id='line_9252'>     So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,</a>
<a id='line_9253'>  Not speaking other word than 'Hast thou won?</a>
<a id='line_9254'>  Art thou the purest, brother?  See, the hand</a>
<a id='line_9255'>  Wherewith thou takest this, is red!' to whom</a>
<a id='line_9256'>  Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,</a>
<a id='line_9257'>  Made answer, 'Ay, but wherefore toss me this</a>
<a id='line_9258'>  Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?</a>
<a id='line_9259'>  Lest be thy fair Queen's fantasy.  Strength of heart</a>
<a id='line_9260'>  And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,</a>
<a id='line_9261'>  Are winners in this pastime of our King.</a>
<a id='line_9262'>  My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--</a>
<a id='line_9263'>  No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,</a>
<a id='line_9264'>  Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>  Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;</a>
<a id='line_9266'>  Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.'</a>
<a id='line_9267'></a>
<a id='line_9268'>     And Tristram round the gallery made his horse</a>
<a id='line_9269'>  Caracole; then bowed his homage, bluntly saying,</a>
<a id='line_9270'>  'Fair damsels, each to him who worships each</a>
<a id='line_9271'>  Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold</a>
<a id='line_9272'>  This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.'</a>
<a id='line_9273'>  And most of these were mute, some angered, one</a>
<a id='line_9274'>  Murmuring, 'All courtesy is dead,' and one,</a>
<a id='line_9275'>  'The glory of our Round Table is no more.'</a>
<a id='line_9276'></a>
<a id='line_9277'>     Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,</a>
<a id='line_9278'>  And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day</a>
<a id='line_9279'>  Went glooming down in wet and weariness:</a>
<a id='line_9280'>  But under her black brows a swarthy one</a>
<a id='line_9281'>  Laughed shrilly, crying, 'Praise the patient saints,</a>
<a id='line_9282'>  Our one white day of Innocence hath past,</a>
<a id='line_9283'>  Though somewhat draggled at the skirt.  So be it.</a>
<a id='line_9284'>  The snowdrop only, flowering through the year,</a>
<a id='line_9285'>  Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.</a>
<a id='line_9286'>  Come--let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen's</a>
<a id='line_9287'>  And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity</a>
<a id='line_9288'>  With all the kindlier colours of the field.'</a>
<a id='line_9289'></a>
<a id='line_9290'>     So dame and damsel glittered at the feast</a>
<a id='line_9291'>  Variously gay:  for he that tells the tale</a>
<a id='line_9292'>  Likened them, saying, as when an hour of cold</a>
<a id='line_9293'>  Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,</a>
<a id='line_9294'>  And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers</a>
<a id='line_9295'>  Pass under white, till the warm hour returns</a>
<a id='line_9296'>  With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;</a>
<a id='line_9297'>  So dame and damsel cast the simple white,</a>
<a id='line_9298'>  And glowing in all colours, the live grass,</a>
<a id='line_9299'>  Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced</a>
<a id='line_9300'>  About the revels, and with mirth so loud</a>
<a id='line_9301'>  Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_9302'>  And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,</a>
<a id='line_9303'>  Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower</a>
<a id='line_9304'>  Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.</a>
<a id='line_9305'></a>
<a id='line_9306'>     And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,</a>
<a id='line_9307'>  High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,</a>
<a id='line_9308'>  Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.</a>
<a id='line_9309'>  Then Tristram saying, 'Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'</a>
<a id='line_9310'>  Wheeled round on either heel, Dagonet replied,</a>
<a id='line_9311'>  'Belike for lack of wiser company;</a>
<a id='line_9312'>  Or being fool, and seeing too much wit</a>
<a id='line_9313'>  Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip</a>
<a id='line_9314'>  To know myself the wisest knight of all.'</a>
<a id='line_9315'>  'Ay, fool,' said Tristram, 'but 'tis eating dry</a>
<a id='line_9316'>  To dance without a catch, a roundelay</a>
<a id='line_9317'>  To dance to.'  Then he twangled on his harp,</a>
<a id='line_9318'>  And while he twangled little Dagonet stood</a>
<a id='line_9319'>  Quiet as any water-sodden log</a>
<a id='line_9320'>  Stayed in the wandering warble of a brook;</a>
<a id='line_9321'>  But when the twangling ended, skipt again;</a>
<a id='line_9322'>  And being asked, 'Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?'</a>
<a id='line_9323'>  Made answer, 'I had liefer twenty years</a>
<a id='line_9324'>  Skip to the broken music of my brains</a>
<a id='line_9325'>  Than any broken music thou canst make.'</a>
<a id='line_9326'>  Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,</a>
<a id='line_9327'>  'Good now, what music have I broken, fool?'</a>
<a id='line_9328'>  And little Dagonet, skipping, 'Arthur, the King's;</a>
<a id='line_9329'>  For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,</a>
<a id='line_9330'>  Thou makest broken music with thy bride,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>  Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--</a>
<a id='line_9332'>  And so thou breakest Arthur's music too.'</a>
<a id='line_9333'>  'Save for that broken music in thy brains,</a>
<a id='line_9334'>  Sir Fool,' said Tristram, 'I would break thy head.</a>
<a id='line_9335'>  Fool, I came too late, the heathen wars were o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9336'>  The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--</a>
<a id='line_9337'>  I am but a fool to reason with a fool--</a>
<a id='line_9338'>  Come, thou art crabbed and sour:  but lean me down,</a>
<a id='line_9339'>  Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,</a>
<a id='line_9340'>  And harken if my music be not true.</a>
<a id='line_9341'></a>
<a id='line_9342'>     '"Free love--free field--we love but while we may:</a>
<a id='line_9343'>  The woods are hushed, their music is no more:</a>
<a id='line_9344'>  The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:</a>
<a id='line_9345'>  New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:</a>
<a id='line_9346'>  New life, new love, to suit the newer day:</a>
<a id='line_9347'>  New loves are sweet as those that went before:</a>
<a id='line_9348'>  Free love--free field--we love but while we may."</a>
<a id='line_9349'></a>
<a id='line_9350'>     'Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,</a>
<a id='line_9351'>  Not stood stockstill.  I made it in the woods,</a>
<a id='line_9352'>  And heard it ring as true as tested gold.'</a>
<a id='line_9353'></a>
<a id='line_9354'>     But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_9355'>  'Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday</a>
<a id='line_9356'>  Made to run wine?--but this had run itself</a>
<a id='line_9357'>  All out like a long life to a sour end--</a>
<a id='line_9358'>  And them that round it sat with golden cups</a>
<a id='line_9359'>  To hand the wine to whosoever came--</a>
<a id='line_9360'>  The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,</a>
<a id='line_9361'>  In honour of poor Innocence the babe,</a>
<a id='line_9362'>  Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen</a>
<a id='line_9363'>  Lent to the King, and Innocence the King</a>
<a id='line_9364'>  Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips</a>
<a id='line_9365'>  Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,</a>
<a id='line_9366'>  "Drink, drink, Sir Fool," and thereupon I drank,</a>
<a id='line_9367'>  Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud.'</a>
<a id='line_9368'></a>
<a id='line_9369'>     And Tristram, 'Was it muddier than thy gibes?</a>
<a id='line_9370'>  Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--</a>
<a id='line_9371'>  Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--</a>
<a id='line_9372'>  "Fear God:  honour the King--his one true knight--</a>
<a id='line_9373'>  Sole follower of the vows"--for here be they</a>
<a id='line_9374'>  Who knew thee swine enow before I came,</a>
<a id='line_9375'>  Smuttier than blasted grain:  but when the King</a>
<a id='line_9376'>  Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up</a>
<a id='line_9377'>  It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;</a>
<a id='line_9378'>  Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,</a>
<a id='line_9379'>  A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,</a>
<a id='line_9380'>  For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine.'</a>
<a id='line_9381'></a>
<a id='line_9382'>     And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,</a>
<a id='line_9383'>  'Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck</a>
<a id='line_9384'>  In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch</a>
<a id='line_9385'>  Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.</a>
<a id='line_9386'>  Swine?  I have wallowed, I have washed--the world</a>
<a id='line_9387'>  Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.</a>
<a id='line_9388'>  The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind</a>
<a id='line_9389'>  Hath fouled me--an I wallowed, then I washed--</a>
<a id='line_9390'>  I have had my day and my philosophies--</a>
<a id='line_9391'>  And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool.</a>
<a id='line_9392'>  Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese</a>
<a id='line_9393'>  Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed</a>
<a id='line_9394'>  On such a wire as musically as thou</a>
<a id='line_9395'>  Some such fine song--but never a king's fool.'</a>
<a id='line_9396'></a>
<a id='line_9397'>     And Tristram, 'Then were swine, goats, asses, geese</a>
<a id='line_9398'>  The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard</a>
<a id='line_9399'>  Had such a mastery of his mystery</a>
<a id='line_9400'>  That he could harp his wife up out of hell.'</a>
<a id='line_9401'></a>
<a id='line_9402'>     Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,</a>
<a id='line_9403'>  'And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself</a>
<a id='line_9404'>  Down! and two more:  a helpful harper thou,</a>
<a id='line_9405'>  That harpest downward!  Dost thou know the star</a>
<a id='line_9406'>  We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?'</a>
<a id='line_9407'></a>
<a id='line_9408'>     And Tristram, 'Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King</a>
<a id='line_9409'>  Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,</a>
<a id='line_9410'>  Glorying in each new glory, set his name</a>
<a id='line_9411'>  High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven.'</a>
<a id='line_9412'></a>
<a id='line_9413'>     And Dagonet answered, 'Ay, and when the land</a>
<a id='line_9414'>  Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself</a>
<a id='line_9415'>  To babble about him, all to show your wit--</a>
<a id='line_9416'>  And whether he were King by courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_9417'>  Or King by right--and so went harping down</a>
<a id='line_9418'>  The black king's highway, got so far, and grew</a>
<a id='line_9419'>  So witty that ye played at ducks and drakes</a>
<a id='line_9420'>  With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.</a>
<a id='line_9421'>  Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?'</a>
<a id='line_9422'></a>
<a id='line_9423'>     'Nay, fool,' said Tristram, 'not in open day.'</a>
<a id='line_9424'>  And Dagonet, 'Nay, nor will:  I see it and hear.</a>
<a id='line_9425'>  It makes a silent music up in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_9426'>  And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,</a>
<a id='line_9427'>  And then we skip.'  'Lo, fool,' he said, 'ye talk</a>
<a id='line_9428'>  Fool's treason:  is the King thy brother fool?'</a>
<a id='line_9429'>  Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled,</a>
<a id='line_9430'>  'Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!</a>
<a id='line_9431'>  Conceits himself as God that he can make</a>
<a id='line_9432'>  Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk</a>
<a id='line_9433'>  From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,</a>
<a id='line_9434'>  And men from beasts--Long live the king of fools!'</a>
<a id='line_9435'></a>
<a id='line_9436'>     And down the city Dagonet danced away;</a>
<a id='line_9437'>  But through the slowly-mellowing avenues</a>
<a id='line_9438'>  And solitary passes of the wood</a>
<a id='line_9439'>  Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.</a>
<a id='line_9440'>  Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt</a>
<a id='line_9441'>  With ruby-circled neck, but evermore</a>
<a id='line_9442'>  Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood</a>
<a id='line_9443'>  Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye</a>
<a id='line_9444'>  For all that walked, or crept, or perched, or flew.</a>
<a id='line_9445'>  Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,</a>
<a id='line_9446'>  Unruffling waters re-collect the shape</a>
<a id='line_9447'>  Of one that in them sees himself, returned;</a>
<a id='line_9448'>  But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,</a>
<a id='line_9449'>  Or even a fallen feather, vanished again.</a>
<a id='line_9450'></a>
<a id='line_9451'>     So on for all that day from lawn to lawn</a>
<a id='line_9452'>  Through many a league-long bower he rode.  At length</a>
<a id='line_9453'>  A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs</a>
<a id='line_9454'>  Furze-crammed, and bracken-rooft, the which himself</a>
<a id='line_9455'>  Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt</a>
<a id='line_9456'>  Against a shower, dark in the golden grove</a>
<a id='line_9457'>  Appearing, sent his fancy back to where</a>
<a id='line_9458'>  She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:</a>
<a id='line_9459'>  Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,</a>
<a id='line_9460'>  With six or seven, when Tristram was away,</a>
<a id='line_9461'>  And snatched her thence; yet dreading worse than shame</a>
<a id='line_9462'>  Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,</a>
<a id='line_9463'>  But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.</a>
<a id='line_9464'></a>
<a id='line_9465'>     And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt</a>
<a id='line_9466'>  So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank</a>
<a id='line_9467'>  Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;</a>
<a id='line_9468'>  But could not rest for musing how to smoothe</a>
<a id='line_9469'>  And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.</a>
<a id='line_9470'>  Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all</a>
<a id='line_9471'>  The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.</a>
<a id='line_9472'>  But then what folly had sent him overseas</a>
<a id='line_9473'>  After she left him lonely here? a name?</a>
<a id='line_9474'>  Was it the name of one in Brittany,</a>
<a id='line_9475'>  Isolt, the daughter of the King?  'Isolt</a>
<a id='line_9476'>  Of the white hands' they called her:  the sweet name</a>
<a id='line_9477'>  Allured him first, and then the maid herself,</a>
<a id='line_9478'>  Who served him well with those white hands of hers,</a>
<a id='line_9479'>  And loved him well, until himself had thought</a>
<a id='line_9480'>  He loved her also, wedded easily,</a>
<a id='line_9481'>  But left her all as easily, and returned.</a>
<a id='line_9482'>  The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes</a>
<a id='line_9483'>  Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid</a>
<a id='line_9484'>  His brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed.</a>
<a id='line_9485'></a>
<a id='line_9486'>     He seemed to pace the strand of Brittany</a>
<a id='line_9487'>  Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,</a>
<a id='line_9488'>  And showed them both the ruby-chain, and both</a>
<a id='line_9489'>  Began to struggle for it, till his Queen</a>
<a id='line_9490'>  Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.</a>
<a id='line_9491'>  Then cried the Breton, 'Look, her hand is red!</a>
<a id='line_9492'>  These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,</a>
<a id='line_9493'>  And melts within her hand--her hand is hot</a>
<a id='line_9494'>  With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,</a>
<a id='line_9495'>  Is all as cool and white as any flower.'</a>
<a id='line_9496'>  Followed a rush of eagle's wings, and then</a>
<a id='line_9497'>  A whimpering of the spirit of the child,</a>
<a id='line_9498'>  Because the twain had spoiled her carcanet.</a>
<a id='line_9499'></a>
<a id='line_9500'>     He dreamed; but Arthur with a hundred spears</a>
<a id='line_9501'>  Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,</a>
<a id='line_9502'>  And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,</a>
<a id='line_9503'>  The wide-winged sunset of the misty marsh</a>
<a id='line_9504'>  Glared on a huge machicolated tower</a>
<a id='line_9505'>  That stood with open doors, whereout was rolled</a>
<a id='line_9506'>  A roar of riot, as from men secure</a>
<a id='line_9507'>  Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease</a>
<a id='line_9508'>  Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.</a>
<a id='line_9509'>  'Lo there,' said one of Arthur's youth, for there,</a>
<a id='line_9510'>  High on a grim dead tree before the tower,</a>
<a id='line_9511'>  A goodly brother of the Table Round</a>
<a id='line_9512'>  Swung by the neck:  and on the boughs a shield</a>
<a id='line_9513'>  Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,</a>
<a id='line_9514'>  And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights</a>
<a id='line_9515'>  At that dishonour done the gilded spur,</a>
<a id='line_9516'>  Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.</a>
<a id='line_9517'>  But Arthur waved them back.  Alone he rode.</a>
<a id='line_9518'>  Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,</a>
<a id='line_9519'>  That sent the face of all the marsh aloft</a>
<a id='line_9520'>  An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud</a>
<a id='line_9521'>  Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,</a>
<a id='line_9522'>  Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,</a>
<a id='line_9523'>  In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King,</a>
<a id='line_9524'></a>
<a id='line_9525'>     'The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!--</a>
<a id='line_9526'>  Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King</a>
<a id='line_9527'>  Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--</a>
<a id='line_9528'>  The woman-worshipper?  Yea, God's curse, and I!</a>
<a id='line_9529'>  Slain was the brother of my paramour</a>
<a id='line_9530'>  By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine</a>
<a id='line_9531'>  And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,</a>
<a id='line_9532'>  Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,</a>
<a id='line_9533'>  And stings itself to everlasting death,</a>
<a id='line_9534'>  To hang whatever knight of thine I fought</a>
<a id='line_9535'>  And tumbled.  Art thou King? --Look to thy life!'</a>
<a id='line_9536'></a>
<a id='line_9537'>     He ended:  Arthur knew the voice; the face</a>
<a id='line_9538'>  Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name</a>
<a id='line_9539'>  Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.</a>
<a id='line_9540'>  And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,</a>
<a id='line_9541'>  But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse</a>
<a id='line_9542'>  To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,</a>
<a id='line_9543'>  Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp</a>
<a id='line_9544'>  Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,</a>
<a id='line_9545'>  Heard in dead night along that table-shore,</a>
<a id='line_9546'>  Drops flat, and after the great waters break</a>
<a id='line_9547'>  Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,</a>
<a id='line_9548'>  Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,</a>
<a id='line_9549'>  From less and less to nothing; thus he fell</a>
<a id='line_9550'>  Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared</a>
<a id='line_9551'>  And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;</a>
<a id='line_9552'>  There trampled out his face from being known,</a>
<a id='line_9553'>  And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:</a>
<a id='line_9554'>  Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang</a>
<a id='line_9555'>  Through open doors, and swording right and left</a>
<a id='line_9556'>  Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled</a>
<a id='line_9557'>  The tables over and the wines, and slew</a>
<a id='line_9558'>  Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,</a>
<a id='line_9559'>  And all the pavement streamed with massacre:</a>
<a id='line_9560'>  Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,</a>
<a id='line_9561'>  Which half that autumn night, like the live North,</a>
<a id='line_9562'>  Red-pulsing up through Alioth and Alcor,</a>
<a id='line_9563'>  Made all above it, and a hundred meres</a>
<a id='line_9564'>  About it, as the water Moab saw</a>
<a id='line_9565'>  Came round by the East, and out beyond them flushed</a>
<a id='line_9566'>  The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.</a>
<a id='line_9567'></a>
<a id='line_9568'>     So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,</a>
<a id='line_9569'>  But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.</a>
<a id='line_9570'></a>
<a id='line_9571'>     Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream</a>
<a id='line_9572'>  Fled with a shout, and that low lodge returned,</a>
<a id='line_9573'>  Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.</a>
<a id='line_9574'>  He whistled his good warhorse left to graze</a>
<a id='line_9575'>  Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,</a>
<a id='line_9576'>  And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,</a>
<a id='line_9577'>  Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,</a>
<a id='line_9578'>  Stayed him.  'Why weep ye?'  'Lord,' she said, 'my man</a>
<a id='line_9579'>  Hath left me or is dead;' whereon he thought--</a>
<a id='line_9580'>  'What, if she hate me now? I would not this.</a>
<a id='line_9581'>  What, if she love me still? I would not that.</a>
<a id='line_9582'>  I know not what I would'--but said to her,</a>
<a id='line_9583'>  'Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,</a>
<a id='line_9584'>  He find thy favour changed and love thee not'--</a>
<a id='line_9585'>  Then pressing day by day through Lyonnesse</a>
<a id='line_9586'>  Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard</a>
<a id='line_9587'>  The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds</a>
<a id='line_9588'>  Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gained</a>
<a id='line_9589'>  Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,</a>
<a id='line_9590'>  A crown of towers.</a>
<a id='line_9591'></a>
<a id='line_9592'>                    Down in a casement sat,</a>
<a id='line_9593'>  A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair</a>
<a id='line_9594'>  And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.</a>
<a id='line_9595'>  And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind</a>
<a id='line_9596'>  The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,</a>
<a id='line_9597'>  Flushed, started, met him at the doors, and there</a>
<a id='line_9598'>  Belted his body with her white embrace,</a>
<a id='line_9599'>  Crying aloud, 'Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!</a>
<a id='line_9600'>  The footstep fluttered me at first:  not he:</a>
<a id='line_9601'>  Catlike through his own castle steals my Mark,</a>
<a id='line_9602'>  But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls</a>
<a id='line_9603'>  Who hates thee, as I him--even to the death.</a>
<a id='line_9604'>  My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark</a>
<a id='line_9605'>  Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh.'</a>
<a id='line_9606'>  To whom Sir Tristram smiling, 'I am here.</a>
<a id='line_9607'>  Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.'</a>
<a id='line_9608'></a>
<a id='line_9609'>     And drawing somewhat backward she replied,</a>
<a id='line_9610'>  'Can he be wronged who is not even his own,</a>
<a id='line_9611'>  But save for dread of thee had beaten me,</a>
<a id='line_9612'>  Scratched, bitten, blinded, marred me somehow--Mark?</a>
<a id='line_9613'>  What rights are his that dare not strike for them?</a>
<a id='line_9614'>  Not lift a hand--not, though he found me thus!</a>
<a id='line_9615'>  But harken! have ye met him? hence he went</a>
<a id='line_9616'>  Today for three days' hunting--as he said--</a>
<a id='line_9617'>  And so returns belike within an hour.</a>
<a id='line_9618'>  Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with Mark,</a>
<a id='line_9619'>  Because he hates thee even more than fears;</a>
<a id='line_9620'>  Nor drink:  and when thou passest any wood</a>
<a id='line_9621'>  Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush</a>
<a id='line_9622'>  Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.</a>
<a id='line_9623'>  My God, the measure of my hate for Mark</a>
<a id='line_9624'>  Is as the measure of my love for thee.'</a>
<a id='line_9625'></a>
<a id='line_9626'>     So, plucked one way by hate and one by love,</a>
<a id='line_9627'>  Drained of her force, again she sat, and spake</a>
<a id='line_9628'>  To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,</a>
<a id='line_9629'>  'O hunter, and O blower of the horn,</a>
<a id='line_9630'>  Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,</a>
<a id='line_9631'>  For, ere I mated with my shambling king,</a>
<a id='line_9632'>  Ye twain had fallen out about the bride</a>
<a id='line_9633'>  Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,</a>
<a id='line_9634'>  If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)--</a>
<a id='line_9635'>  Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks</a>
<a id='line_9636'>  To wreck thee villainously:  but, O Sir Knight,</a>
<a id='line_9637'>  What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?'</a>
<a id='line_9638'></a>
<a id='line_9639'>     And Tristram, 'Last to my Queen Paramount,</a>
<a id='line_9640'>  Here now to my Queen Paramount of love</a>
<a id='line_9641'>  And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when first</a>
<a id='line_9642'>  Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,</a>
<a id='line_9643'>  Sailing from Ireland.'</a>
<a id='line_9644'></a>
<a id='line_9645'>                        Softly laughed Isolt;</a>
<a id='line_9646'>  'Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen</a>
<a id='line_9647'>  My dole of beauty trebled?' and he said,</a>
<a id='line_9648'>  'Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,</a>
<a id='line_9649'>  And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--</a>
<a id='line_9650'>  Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips</a>
<a id='line_9651'>  Most gracious; but she, haughty, even to him,</a>
<a id='line_9652'>  Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow</a>
<a id='line_9653'>  To make one doubt if ever the great Queen</a>
<a id='line_9654'>  Have yielded him her love.'</a>
<a id='line_9655'></a>
<a id='line_9656'>                             To whom Isolt,</a>
<a id='line_9657'>  'Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou</a>
<a id='line_9658'>  Who brakest through the scruple of my bond,</a>
<a id='line_9659'>  Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me</a>
<a id='line_9660'>  That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,</a>
<a id='line_9661'>  And I--misyoked with such a want of man--</a>
<a id='line_9662'>  That I could hardly sin against the lowest.'</a>
<a id='line_9663'></a>
<a id='line_9664'>     He answered, 'O my soul, be comforted!</a>
<a id='line_9665'>  If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,</a>
<a id='line_9666'>  If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,</a>
<a id='line_9667'>  Crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin</a>
<a id='line_9668'>  That made us happy:  but how ye greet me--fear</a>
<a id='line_9669'>  And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--</a>
<a id='line_9670'>  Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories</a>
<a id='line_9671'>  Of Tristram in that year he was away.'</a>
<a id='line_9672'></a>
<a id='line_9673'>     And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,</a>
<a id='line_9674'>  'I had forgotten all in my strong joy</a>
<a id='line_9675'>  To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,</a>
<a id='line_9676'>  Here in the never-ended afternoon,</a>
<a id='line_9677'>  O sweeter than all memories of thee,</a>
<a id='line_9678'>  Deeper than any yearnings after thee</a>
<a id='line_9679'>  Seemed those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,</a>
<a id='line_9680'>  Watched from this tower.  Isolt of Britain dashed</a>
<a id='line_9681'>  Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,</a>
<a id='line_9682'>  Would that have chilled her bride-kiss?  Wedded her?</a>
<a id='line_9683'>  Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?</a>
<a id='line_9684'>  The King was all fulfilled with gratefulness,</a>
<a id='line_9685'>  And she, my namesake of the hands, that healed</a>
<a id='line_9686'>  Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--</a>
<a id='line_9687'>  Well--can I wish her any huger wrong</a>
<a id='line_9688'>  Than having known thee? her too hast thou left</a>
<a id='line_9689'>  To pine and waste in those sweet memories.</a>
<a id='line_9690'>  O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men</a>
<a id='line_9691'>  Are noble, I should hate thee more than love.'</a>
<a id='line_9692'></a>
<a id='line_9693'>     And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,</a>
<a id='line_9694'>  'Grace, Queen, for being loved:  she loved me well.</a>
<a id='line_9695'>  Did I love her? the name at least I loved.</a>
<a id='line_9696'>  Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!</a>
<a id='line_9697'>  The night was dark; the true star set.  Isolt!</a>
<a id='line_9698'>  The name was ruler of the dark--Isolt?</a>
<a id='line_9699'>  Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,</a>
<a id='line_9700'>  Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God.'</a>
<a id='line_9701'></a>
<a id='line_9702'>     And Isolt answered, 'Yea, and why not I?</a>
<a id='line_9703'>  Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,</a>
<a id='line_9704'>  Pale-blooded, prayerful.  Let me tell thee now.</a>
<a id='line_9705'>  Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,</a>
<a id='line_9706'>  Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,</a>
<a id='line_9707'>  Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,</a>
<a id='line_9708'>  And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.</a>
<a id='line_9709'>  Then flashed a levin-brand; and near me stood,</a>
<a id='line_9710'>  In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--</a>
<a id='line_9711'>  Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--</a>
<a id='line_9712'>  For there was Mark:  "He has wedded her," he said,</a>
<a id='line_9713'>  Not said, but hissed it:  then this crown of towers</a>
<a id='line_9714'>  So shook to such a roar of all the sky,</a>
<a id='line_9715'>  That here in utter dark I swooned away,</a>
<a id='line_9716'>  And woke again in utter dark, and cried,</a>
<a id='line_9717'>  "I will flee hence and give myself to God"--</a>
<a id='line_9718'>  And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms.'</a>
<a id='line_9719'></a>
<a id='line_9720'>     Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,</a>
<a id='line_9721'>  'May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,</a>
<a id='line_9722'>  And past desire!' a saying that angered her.</a>
<a id='line_9723'>  '"May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,</a>
<a id='line_9724'>  And sweet no more to me!"  I need Him now.</a>
<a id='line_9725'>  For when had Lancelot uttered aught so gross</a>
<a id='line_9726'>  Even to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?</a>
<a id='line_9727'>  The greater man, the greater courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_9728'>  Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight!</a>
<a id='line_9729'>  But thou, through ever harrying thy wild beasts--</a>
<a id='line_9730'>  Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance</a>
<a id='line_9731'>  Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.</a>
<a id='line_9732'>  How darest thou, if lover, push me even</a>
<a id='line_9733'>  In fancy from thy side, and set me far</a>
<a id='line_9734'>  In the gray distance, half a life away,</a>
<a id='line_9735'>  Her to be loved no more?  Unsay it, unswear!</a>
<a id='line_9736'>  Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,</a>
<a id='line_9737'>  Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,</a>
<a id='line_9738'>  Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck</a>
<a id='line_9739'>  Lies like sweet wines:  lie to me:  I believe.</a>
<a id='line_9740'>  Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,</a>
<a id='line_9741'>  And solemnly as when ye sware to him,</a>
<a id='line_9742'>  The man of men, our King--My God, the power</a>
<a id='line_9743'>  Was once in vows when men believed the King!</a>
<a id='line_9744'>  They lied not then, who sware, and through their vows</a>
<a id='line_9745'>  The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,</a>
<a id='line_9746'>  Swear to me thou wilt love me even when old,</a>
<a id='line_9747'>  Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair.'</a>
<a id='line_9748'></a>
<a id='line_9749'>     Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,</a>
<a id='line_9750'>  'Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark</a>
<a id='line_9751'>  More than I mine?  Lied, say ye?  Nay, but learnt,</a>
<a id='line_9752'>  The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--</a>
<a id='line_9753'>  My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--</a>
<a id='line_9754'>  We run more counter to the soul thereof</a>
<a id='line_9755'>  Than had we never sworn.  I swear no more.</a>
<a id='line_9756'>  I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.</a>
<a id='line_9757'>  For once--even to the height--I honoured him.</a>
<a id='line_9758'>  "Man, is he man at all?" methought, when first</a>
<a id='line_9759'>  I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld</a>
<a id='line_9760'>  That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--</a>
<a id='line_9761'>  His hair, a sun that rayed from off a brow</a>
<a id='line_9762'>  Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,</a>
<a id='line_9763'>  The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--</a>
<a id='line_9764'>  Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,</a>
<a id='line_9765'>  With Merlin's mystic babble about his end</a>
<a id='line_9766'>  Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool</a>
<a id='line_9767'>  Shaped as a dragon; he seemed to me no man,</a>
<a id='line_9768'>  But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware,</a>
<a id='line_9769'>  Being amazed:  but this went by-- The vows!</a>
<a id='line_9770'>  O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--</a>
<a id='line_9771'>  They served their use, their time; for every knight</a>
<a id='line_9772'>  Believed himself a greater than himself,</a>
<a id='line_9773'>  And every follower eyed him as a God;</a>
<a id='line_9774'>  Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,</a>
<a id='line_9775'>  Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,</a>
<a id='line_9776'>  And so the realm was made; but then their vows--</a>
<a id='line_9777'>  First mainly through that sullying of our Queen--</a>
<a id='line_9778'>  Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence</a>
<a id='line_9779'>  Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?</a>
<a id='line_9780'>  Dropt down from heaven? washed up from out the deep?</a>
<a id='line_9781'>  They failed to trace him through the flesh and blood</a>
<a id='line_9782'>  Of our old kings:  whence then? a doubtful lord</a>
<a id='line_9783'>  To bind them by inviolable vows,</a>
<a id='line_9784'>  Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:</a>
<a id='line_9785'>  For feel this arm of mine--the tide within</a>
<a id='line_9786'>  Red with free chase and heather-scented air,</a>
<a id='line_9787'>  Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure</a>
<a id='line_9788'>  As any maiden child? lock up my tongue</a>
<a id='line_9789'>  From uttering freely what I freely hear?</a>
<a id='line_9790'>  Bind me to one?  The wide world laughs at it.</a>
<a id='line_9791'>  And worldling of the world am I, and know</a>
<a id='line_9792'>  The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour</a>
<a id='line_9793'>  Woos his own end; we are not angels here</a>
<a id='line_9794'>  Nor shall be:  vows--I am woodman of the woods,</a>
<a id='line_9795'>  And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale</a>
<a id='line_9796'>  Mock them:  my soul, we love but while we may;</a>
<a id='line_9797'>  And therefore is my love so large for thee,</a>
<a id='line_9798'>  Seeing it is not bounded save by love.'</a>
<a id='line_9799'></a>
<a id='line_9800'>     Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,</a>
<a id='line_9801'>  'Good:  an I turned away my love for thee</a>
<a id='line_9802'>  To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--</a>
<a id='line_9803'>  For courtesy wins woman all as well</a>
<a id='line_9804'>  As valour may, but he that closes both</a>
<a id='line_9805'>  Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,</a>
<a id='line_9806'>  Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I loved</a>
<a id='line_9807'>  This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back</a>
<a id='line_9808'>  Thine own small saw, "We love but while we may,"</a>
<a id='line_9809'>  Well then, what answer?'</a>
<a id='line_9810'></a>
<a id='line_9811'>                          He that while she spake,</a>
<a id='line_9812'>  Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,</a>
<a id='line_9813'>  The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch</a>
<a id='line_9814'>  The warm white apple of her throat, replied,</a>
<a id='line_9815'>  'Press this a little closer, sweet, until--</a>
<a id='line_9816'>  Come, I am hungered and half-angered--meat,</a>
<a id='line_9817'>  Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,</a>
<a id='line_9818'>  And out beyond into the dream to come.'</a>
<a id='line_9819'></a>
<a id='line_9820'>     So then, when both were brought to full accord,</a>
<a id='line_9821'>  She rose, and set before him all he willed;</a>
<a id='line_9822'>  And after these had comforted the blood</a>
<a id='line_9823'>  With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--</a>
<a id='line_9824'>  Now talking of their woodland paradise,</a>
<a id='line_9825'>  The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;</a>
<a id='line_9826'>  Now mocking at the much ungainliness,</a>
<a id='line_9827'>  And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--</a>
<a id='line_9828'>  Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:</a>
<a id='line_9829'></a>
<a id='line_9830'>     'Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!</a>
<a id='line_9831'>  A star in heaven, a star within the mere!</a>
<a id='line_9832'>  Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,</a>
<a id='line_9833'>  And one was far apart, and one was near:</a>
<a id='line_9834'>  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!</a>
<a id='line_9835'>  And one was water and one star was fire,</a>
<a id='line_9836'>  And one will ever shine and one will pass.</a>
<a id='line_9837'>  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere.'</a>
<a id='line_9838'></a>
<a id='line_9839'>     Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram showed</a>
<a id='line_9840'>  And swung the ruby carcanet.  She cried,</a>
<a id='line_9841'>  'The collar of some Order, which our King</a>
<a id='line_9842'>  Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,</a>
<a id='line_9843'>  For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers.'</a>
<a id='line_9844'></a>
<a id='line_9845'>     'Not so, my Queen,' he said, 'but the red fruit</a>
<a id='line_9846'>  Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,</a>
<a id='line_9847'>  And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,</a>
<a id='line_9848'>  And hither brought by Tristram for his last</a>
<a id='line_9849'>  Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee.'</a>
<a id='line_9850'></a>
<a id='line_9851'>     He spoke, he turned, then, flinging round her neck,</a>
<a id='line_9852'>  Claspt it, and cried, 'Thine Order, O my Queen!'</a>
<a id='line_9853'>  But, while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat,</a>
<a id='line_9854'>  Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,</a>
<a id='line_9855'>  Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--</a>
<a id='line_9856'>  'Mark's way,' said Mark, and clove him through the brain.</a>
<a id='line_9857'></a>
<a id='line_9858'>     That night came Arthur home, and while he climbed,</a>
<a id='line_9859'>  All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,</a>
<a id='line_9860'>  The stairway to the hall, and looked and saw</a>
<a id='line_9861'>  The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his feet</a>
<a id='line_9862'>  A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it,</a>
<a id='line_9863'>  'What art thou?' and the voice about his feet</a>
<a id='line_9864'>  Sent up an answer, sobbing, 'I am thy fool,</a>
<a id='line_9865'>  And I shall never make thee smile again.'</a>
<a id='line_9866'></a>
<a id='line_9867'></a>
<a id='line_9868'></a>
<a id='line_9869'>  Guinevere</a>
<a id='line_9870'></a>
<a id='line_9871'>  Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat</a>
<a id='line_9872'>  There in the holy house at Almesbury</a>
<a id='line_9873'>  Weeping, none with her save a little maid,</a>
<a id='line_9874'>  A novice:  one low light betwixt them burned</a>
<a id='line_9875'>  Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad,</a>
<a id='line_9876'>  Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,</a>
<a id='line_9877'>  The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,</a>
<a id='line_9878'>  Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.</a>
<a id='line_9879'></a>
<a id='line_9880'>     For hither had she fled, her cause of flight</a>
<a id='line_9881'>  Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast</a>
<a id='line_9882'>  Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne,</a>
<a id='line_9883'>  Ready to spring, waiting a chance:  for this</a>
<a id='line_9884'>  He chilled the popular praises of the King</a>
<a id='line_9885'>  With silent smiles of slow disparagement;</a>
<a id='line_9886'>  And tampered with the Lords of the White Horse,</a>
<a id='line_9887'>  Heathen, the brood by Hengist left; and sought</a>
<a id='line_9888'>  To make disruption in the Table Round</a>
<a id='line_9889'>  Of Arthur, and to splinter it into feuds</a>
<a id='line_9890'>  Serving his traitorous end; and all his aims</a>
<a id='line_9891'>  Were sharpened by strong hate for Lancelot.</a>
<a id='line_9892'></a>
<a id='line_9893'>     For thus it chanced one morn when all the court,</a>
<a id='line_9894'>  Green-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,</a>
<a id='line_9895'>  Had been, their wont, a-maying and returned,</a>
<a id='line_9896'>  That Modred still in green, all ear and eye,</a>
<a id='line_9897'>  Climbed to the high top of the garden-wall</a>
<a id='line_9898'>  To spy some secret scandal if he might,</a>
<a id='line_9899'>  And saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best</a>
<a id='line_9900'>  Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court</a>
<a id='line_9901'>  The wiliest and the worst; and more than this</a>
<a id='line_9902'>  He saw not, for Sir Lancelot passing by</a>
<a id='line_9903'>  Spied where he couched, and as the gardener's hand</a>
<a id='line_9904'>  Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar,</a>
<a id='line_9905'>  So from the high wall and the flowering grove</a>
<a id='line_9906'>  Of grasses Lancelot plucked him by the heel,</a>
<a id='line_9907'>  And cast him as a worm upon the way;</a>
<a id='line_9908'>  But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust,</a>
<a id='line_9909'>  He, reverencing king's blood in a bad man,</a>
<a id='line_9910'>  Made such excuses as he might, and these</a>
<a id='line_9911'>  Full knightly without scorn; for in those days</a>
<a id='line_9912'>  No knight of Arthur's noblest dealt in scorn;</a>
<a id='line_9913'>  But, if a man were halt or hunched, in him</a>
<a id='line_9914'>  By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall,</a>
<a id='line_9915'>  Scorn was allowed as part of his defect,</a>
<a id='line_9916'>  And he was answered softly by the King</a>
<a id='line_9917'>  And all his Table.  So Sir Lancelot holp</a>
<a id='line_9918'>  To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice</a>
<a id='line_9919'>  Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went:</a>
<a id='line_9920'>  But, ever after, the small violence done</a>
<a id='line_9921'>  Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart,</a>
<a id='line_9922'>  As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long</a>
<a id='line_9923'>  A little bitter pool about a stone</a>
<a id='line_9924'>  On the bare coast.</a>
<a id='line_9925'></a>
<a id='line_9926'>                    But when Sir Lancelot told</a>
<a id='line_9927'>  This matter to the Queen, at first she laughed</a>
<a id='line_9928'>  Lightly, to think of Modred's dusty fall,</a>
<a id='line_9929'>  Then shuddered, as the village wife who cries</a>
<a id='line_9930'>  'I shudder, some one steps across my grave;'</a>
<a id='line_9931'>  Then laughed again, but faintlier, for indeed</a>
<a id='line_9932'>  She half-foresaw that he, the subtle beast,</a>
<a id='line_9933'>  Would track her guilt until he found, and hers</a>
<a id='line_9934'>  Would be for evermore a name of scorn.</a>
<a id='line_9935'>  Henceforward rarely could she front in hall,</a>
<a id='line_9936'>  Or elsewhere, Modred's narrow foxy face,</a>
<a id='line_9937'>  Heart-hiding smile, and gray persistent eye:</a>
<a id='line_9938'>  Henceforward too, the Powers that tend the soul,</a>
<a id='line_9939'>  To help it from the death that cannot die,</a>
<a id='line_9940'>  And save it even in extremes, began</a>
<a id='line_9941'>  To vex and plague her.  Many a time for hours,</a>
<a id='line_9942'>  Beside the placid breathings of the King,</a>
<a id='line_9943'>  In the dead night, grim faces came and went</a>
<a id='line_9944'>  Before her, or a vague spiritual fear--</a>
<a id='line_9945'>  Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,</a>
<a id='line_9946'>  Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,</a>
<a id='line_9947'>  That keeps the rust of murder on the walls--</a>
<a id='line_9948'>  Held her awake:  or if she slept, she dreamed</a>
<a id='line_9949'>  An awful dream; for then she seemed to stand</a>
<a id='line_9950'>  On some vast plain before a setting sun,</a>
<a id='line_9951'>  And from the sun there swiftly made at her</a>
<a id='line_9952'>  A ghastly something, and its shadow flew</a>
<a id='line_9953'>  Before it, till it touched her, and she turned--</a>
<a id='line_9954'>  When lo! her own, that broadening from her feet,</a>
<a id='line_9955'>  And blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it</a>
<a id='line_9956'>  Far cities burnt, and with a cry she woke.</a>
<a id='line_9957'>  And all this trouble did not pass but grew;</a>
<a id='line_9958'>  Till even the clear face of the guileless King,</a>
<a id='line_9959'>  And trustful courtesies of household life,</a>
<a id='line_9960'>  Became her bane; and at the last she said,</a>
<a id='line_9961'>  'O Lancelot, get thee hence to thine own land,</a>
<a id='line_9962'>  For if thou tarry we shall meet again,</a>
<a id='line_9963'>  And if we meet again, some evil chance</a>
<a id='line_9964'>  Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze</a>
<a id='line_9965'>  Before the people, and our lord the King.'</a>
<a id='line_9966'>  And Lancelot ever promised, but remained,</a>
<a id='line_9967'>  And still they met and met.  Again she said,</a>
<a id='line_9968'>  'O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence.'</a>
<a id='line_9969'>  And then they were agreed upon a night</a>
<a id='line_9970'>  (When the good King should not be there) to meet</a>
<a id='line_9971'>  And part for ever.  Vivien, lurking, heard.</a>
<a id='line_9972'>  She told Sir Modred.  Passion-pale they met</a>
<a id='line_9973'>  And greeted.  Hands in hands, and eye to eye,</a>
<a id='line_9974'>  Low on the border of her couch they sat</a>
<a id='line_9975'>  Stammering and staring.  It was their last hour,</a>
<a id='line_9976'>  A madness of farewells.  And Modred brought</a>
<a id='line_9977'>  His creatures to the basement of the tower</a>
<a id='line_9978'>  For testimony; and crying with full voice</a>
<a id='line_9979'>  'Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last,' aroused</a>
<a id='line_9980'>  Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike</a>
<a id='line_9981'>  Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell</a>
<a id='line_9982'>  Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off,</a>
<a id='line_9983'>  And all was still:  then she, 'The end is come,</a>
<a id='line_9984'>  And I am shamed for ever;' and he said,</a>
<a id='line_9985'>  'Mine be the shame; mine was the sin:  but rise,</a>
<a id='line_9986'>  And fly to my strong castle overseas:</a>
<a id='line_9987'>  There will I hide thee, till my life shall end,</a>
<a id='line_9988'>  There hold thee with my life against the world.'</a>
<a id='line_9989'>  She answered, 'Lancelot, wilt thou hold me so?</a>
<a id='line_9990'>  Nay, friend, for we have taken our farewells.</a>
<a id='line_9991'>  Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself!</a>
<a id='line_9992'>  Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou</a>
<a id='line_9993'>  Unwedded:  yet rise now, and let us fly,</a>
<a id='line_9994'>  For I will draw me into sanctuary,</a>
<a id='line_9995'>  And bide my doom.'  So Lancelot got her horse,</a>
<a id='line_9996'>  Set her thereon, and mounted on his own,</a>
<a id='line_9997'>  And then they rode to the divided way,</a>
<a id='line_9998'>  There kissed, and parted weeping:  for he past,</a>
<a id='line_9999'>  Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_10000'>  Back to his land; but she to Almesbury</a>
<a id='line_10001'>  Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald,</a>
<a id='line_10002'>  And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald</a>
<a id='line_10003'>  Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan:</a>
<a id='line_10004'>  And in herself she moaned 'Too late, too late!'</a>
<a id='line_10005'>  Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn,</a>
<a id='line_10006'>  A blot in heaven, the Raven, flying high,</a>
<a id='line_10007'>  Croaked, and she thought, 'He spies a field of death;</a>
<a id='line_10008'>  For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea,</a>
<a id='line_10009'>  Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court,</a>
<a id='line_10010'>  Begin to slay the folk, and spoil the land.'</a>
<a id='line_10011'></a>
<a id='line_10012'>     And when she came to Almesbury she spake</a>
<a id='line_10013'>  There to the nuns, and said, 'Mine enemies</a>
<a id='line_10014'>  Pursue me, but, O peaceful Sisterhood,</a>
<a id='line_10015'>  Receive, and yield me sanctuary, nor ask</a>
<a id='line_10016'>  Her name to whom ye yield it, till her time</a>
<a id='line_10017'>  To tell you:' and her beauty, grace and power,</a>
<a id='line_10018'>  Wrought as a charm upon them, and they spared</a>
<a id='line_10019'>  To ask it.</a>
<a id='line_10020'></a>
<a id='line_10021'>            So the stately Queen abode</a>
<a id='line_10022'>  For many a week, unknown, among the nuns;</a>
<a id='line_10023'>  Nor with them mixed, nor told her name, nor sought,</a>
<a id='line_10024'>  Wrapt in her grief, for housel or for shrift,</a>
<a id='line_10025'>  But communed only with the little maid,</a>
<a id='line_10026'>  Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness</a>
<a id='line_10027'>  Which often lured her from herself; but now,</a>
<a id='line_10028'>  This night, a rumour wildly blown about</a>
<a id='line_10029'>  Came, that Sir Modred had usurped the realm,</a>
<a id='line_10030'>  And leagued him with the heathen, while the King</a>
<a id='line_10031'>  Was waging war on Lancelot:  then she thought,</a>
<a id='line_10032'>  'With what a hate the people and the King</a>
<a id='line_10033'>  Must hate me,' and bowed down upon her hands</a>
<a id='line_10034'>  Silent, until the little maid, who brooked</a>
<a id='line_10035'>  No silence, brake it, uttering, 'Late! so late!</a>
<a id='line_10036'>  What hour, I wonder, now?' and when she drew</a>
<a id='line_10037'>  No answer, by and by began to hum</a>
<a id='line_10038'>  An air the nuns had taught her; 'Late, so late!'</a>
<a id='line_10039'>  Which when she heard, the Queen looked up, and said,</a>
<a id='line_10040'>  'O maiden, if indeed ye list to sing,</a>
<a id='line_10041'>  Sing, and unbind my heart that I may weep.'</a>
<a id='line_10042'>  Whereat full willingly sang the little maid.</a>
<a id='line_10043'></a>
<a id='line_10044'>     'Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!</a>
<a id='line_10045'>  Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.</a>
<a id='line_10046'>  Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.</a>
<a id='line_10047'></a>
<a id='line_10048'>     'No light had we:  for that we do repent;</a>
<a id='line_10049'>  And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.</a>
<a id='line_10050'>  Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.</a>
<a id='line_10051'></a>
<a id='line_10052'>     'No light:  so late! and dark and chill the night!</a>
<a id='line_10053'>  O let us in, that we may find the light!</a>
<a id='line_10054'>  Too late, too late:  ye cannot enter now.</a>
<a id='line_10055'></a>
<a id='line_10056'>     'Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?</a>
<a id='line_10057'>  O let us in, though late, to kiss his feet!</a>
<a id='line_10058'>  No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.'</a>
<a id='line_10059'></a>
<a id='line_10060'>     So sang the novice, while full passionately,</a>
<a id='line_10061'>  Her head upon her hands, remembering</a>
<a id='line_10062'>  Her thought when first she came, wept the sad Queen.</a>
<a id='line_10063'>  Then said the little novice prattling to her,</a>
<a id='line_10064'>     'O pray you, noble lady, weep no more;</a>
<a id='line_10065'>  But let my words, the words of one so small,</a>
<a id='line_10066'>  Who knowing nothing knows but to obey,</a>
<a id='line_10067'>  And if I do not there is penance given--</a>
<a id='line_10068'>  Comfort your sorrows; for they do not flow</a>
<a id='line_10069'>  From evil done; right sure am I of that,</a>
<a id='line_10070'>  Who see your tender grace and stateliness.</a>
<a id='line_10071'>  But weigh your sorrows with our lord the King's,</a>
<a id='line_10072'>  And weighing find them less; for gone is he</a>
<a id='line_10073'>  To wage grim war against Sir Lancelot there,</a>
<a id='line_10074'>  Round that strong castle where he holds the Queen;</a>
<a id='line_10075'>  And Modred whom he left in charge of all,</a>
<a id='line_10076'>  The traitor--Ah sweet lady, the King's grief</a>
<a id='line_10077'>  For his own self, and his own Queen, and realm,</a>
<a id='line_10078'>  Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours.</a>
<a id='line_10079'>  For me, I thank the saints, I am not great.</a>
<a id='line_10080'>  For if there ever come a grief to me</a>
<a id='line_10081'>  I cry my cry in silence, and have done.</a>
<a id='line_10082'>  None knows it, and my tears have brought me good:</a>
<a id='line_10083'>  But even were the griefs of little ones</a>
<a id='line_10084'>  As great as those of great ones, yet this grief</a>
<a id='line_10085'>  Is added to the griefs the great must bear,</a>
<a id='line_10086'>  That howsoever much they may desire</a>
<a id='line_10087'>  Silence, they cannot weep behind a cloud:</a>
<a id='line_10088'>  As even here they talk at Almesbury</a>
<a id='line_10089'>  About the good King and his wicked Queen,</a>
<a id='line_10090'>  And were I such a King with such a Queen,</a>
<a id='line_10091'>  Well might I wish to veil her wickedness,</a>
<a id='line_10092'>  But were I such a King, it could not be.'</a>
<a id='line_10093'></a>
<a id='line_10094'>     Then to her own sad heart muttered the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_10095'>  'Will the child kill me with her innocent talk?'</a>
<a id='line_10096'>  But openly she answered, 'Must not I,</a>
<a id='line_10097'>  If this false traitor have displaced his lord,</a>
<a id='line_10098'>  Grieve with the common grief of all the realm?'</a>
<a id='line_10099'></a>
<a id='line_10100'>     'Yea,' said the maid, 'this is all woman's grief,</a>
<a id='line_10101'>  That she is woman, whose disloyal life</a>
<a id='line_10102'>  Hath wrought confusion in the Table Round</a>
<a id='line_10103'>  Which good King Arthur founded, years ago,</a>
<a id='line_10104'>  With signs and miracles and wonders, there</a>
<a id='line_10105'>  At Camelot, ere the coming of the Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_10106'></a>
<a id='line_10107'>     Then thought the Queen within herself again,</a>
<a id='line_10108'>  'Will the child kill me with her foolish prate?'</a>
<a id='line_10109'>  But openly she spake and said to her,</a>
<a id='line_10110'>  'O little maid, shut in by nunnery walls,</a>
<a id='line_10111'>  What canst thou know of Kings and Tables Round,</a>
<a id='line_10112'>  Or what of signs and wonders, but the signs</a>
<a id='line_10113'>  And simple miracles of thy nunnery?'</a>
<a id='line_10114'></a>
<a id='line_10115'>     To whom the little novice garrulously,</a>
<a id='line_10116'>  'Yea, but I know:  the land was full of signs</a>
<a id='line_10117'>  And wonders ere the coming of the Queen.</a>
<a id='line_10118'>  So said my father, and himself was knight</a>
<a id='line_10119'>  Of the great Table--at the founding of it;</a>
<a id='line_10120'>  And rode thereto from Lyonnesse, and he said</a>
<a id='line_10121'>  That as he rode, an hour or maybe twain</a>
<a id='line_10122'>  After the sunset, down the coast, he heard</a>
<a id='line_10123'>  Strange music, and he paused, and turning--there,</a>
<a id='line_10124'>  All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse,</a>
<a id='line_10125'>  Each with a beacon-star upon his head,</a>
<a id='line_10126'>  And with a wild sea-light about his feet,</a>
<a id='line_10127'>  He saw them--headland after headland flame</a>
<a id='line_10128'>  Far on into the rich heart of the west:</a>
<a id='line_10129'>  And in the light the white mermaiden swam,</a>
<a id='line_10130'>  And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,</a>
<a id='line_10131'>  And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,</a>
<a id='line_10132'>  To which the little elves of chasm and cleft</a>
<a id='line_10133'>  Made answer, sounding like a distant horn.</a>
<a id='line_10134'>  So said my father--yea, and furthermore,</a>
<a id='line_10135'>  Next morning, while he past the dim-lit woods,</a>
<a id='line_10136'>  Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy</a>
<a id='line_10137'>  Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower,</a>
<a id='line_10138'>  That shook beneath them, as the thistle shakes</a>
<a id='line_10139'>  When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed:</a>
<a id='line_10140'>  And still at evenings on before his horse</a>
<a id='line_10141'>  The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke</a>
<a id='line_10142'>  Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke</a>
<a id='line_10143'>  Flying, for all the land was full of life.</a>
<a id='line_10144'>  And when at last he came to Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_10145'>  A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand</a>
<a id='line_10146'>  Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall;</a>
<a id='line_10147'>  And in the hall itself was such a feast</a>
<a id='line_10148'>  As never man had dreamed; for every knight</a>
<a id='line_10149'>  Had whatsoever meat he longed for served</a>
<a id='line_10150'>  By hands unseen; and even as he said</a>
<a id='line_10151'>  Down in the cellars merry bloated things</a>
<a id='line_10152'>  Shouldered the spigot, straddling on the butts</a>
<a id='line_10153'>  While the wine ran:  so glad were spirits and men</a>
<a id='line_10154'>  Before the coming of the sinful Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_10155'></a>
<a id='line_10156'>     Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly,</a>
<a id='line_10157'>  'Were they so glad? ill prophets were they all,</a>
<a id='line_10158'>  Spirits and men:  could none of them foresee,</a>
<a id='line_10159'>  Not even thy wise father with his signs</a>
<a id='line_10160'>  And wonders, what has fallen upon the realm?'</a>
<a id='line_10161'></a>
<a id='line_10162'>     To whom the novice garrulously again,</a>
<a id='line_10163'>  'Yea, one, a bard; of whom my father said,</a>
<a id='line_10164'>  Full many a noble war-song had he sung,</a>
<a id='line_10165'>  Even in the presence of an enemy's fleet,</a>
<a id='line_10166'>  Between the steep cliff and the coming wave;</a>
<a id='line_10167'>  And many a mystic lay of life and death</a>
<a id='line_10168'>  Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops,</a>
<a id='line_10169'>  When round him bent the spirits of the hills</a>
<a id='line_10170'>  With all their dewy hair blown back like flame:</a>
<a id='line_10171'>  So said my father--and that night the bard</a>
<a id='line_10172'>  Sang Arthur's glorious wars, and sang the King</a>
<a id='line_10173'>  As wellnigh more than man, and railed at those</a>
<a id='line_10174'>  Who called him the false son of Gorlois:</a>
<a id='line_10175'>  For there was no man knew from whence he came;</a>
<a id='line_10176'>  But after tempest, when the long wave broke</a>
<a id='line_10177'>  All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos,</a>
<a id='line_10178'>  There came a day as still as heaven, and then</a>
<a id='line_10179'>  They found a naked child upon the sands</a>
<a id='line_10180'>  Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea;</a>
<a id='line_10181'>  And that was Arthur; and they fostered him</a>
<a id='line_10182'>  Till he by miracle was approven King:</a>
<a id='line_10183'>  And that his grave should be a mystery</a>
<a id='line_10184'>  From all men, like his birth; and could he find</a>
<a id='line_10185'>  A woman in her womanhood as great</a>
<a id='line_10186'>  As he was in his manhood, then, he sang,</a>
<a id='line_10187'>  The twain together well might change the world.</a>
<a id='line_10188'>  But even in the middle of his song</a>
<a id='line_10189'>  He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp,</a>
<a id='line_10190'>  And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen,</a>
<a id='line_10191'>  But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell</a>
<a id='line_10192'>  His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw</a>
<a id='line_10193'>  This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen?'</a>
<a id='line_10194'></a>
<a id='line_10195'>     Then thought the Queen, 'Lo! they have set her on,</a>
<a id='line_10196'>  Our simple-seeming Abbess and her nuns,</a>
<a id='line_10197'>  To play upon me,' and bowed her head nor spake.</a>
<a id='line_10198'>  Whereat the novice crying, with clasped hands,</a>
<a id='line_10199'>  Shame on her own garrulity garrulously,</a>
<a id='line_10200'>  Said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue</a>
<a id='line_10201'>  Full often, 'and, sweet lady, if I seem</a>
<a id='line_10202'>  To vex an ear too sad to listen to me,</a>
<a id='line_10203'>  Unmannerly, with prattling and the tales</a>
<a id='line_10204'>  Which my good father told me, check me too</a>
<a id='line_10205'>  Nor let me shame my father's memory, one</a>
<a id='line_10206'>  Of noblest manners, though himself would say</a>
<a id='line_10207'>  Sir Lancelot had the noblest; and he died,</a>
<a id='line_10208'>  Killed in a tilt, come next, five summers back,</a>
<a id='line_10209'>  And left me; but of others who remain,</a>
<a id='line_10210'>  And of the two first-famed for courtesy--</a>
<a id='line_10211'>  And pray you check me if I ask amiss--</a>
<a id='line_10212'>  But pray you, which had noblest, while you moved</a>
<a id='line_10213'>  Among them, Lancelot or our lord the King?'</a>
<a id='line_10214'></a>
<a id='line_10215'>     Then the pale Queen looked up and answered her,</a>
<a id='line_10216'>  'Sir Lancelot, as became a noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_10217'>  Was gracious to all ladies, and the same</a>
<a id='line_10218'>  In open battle or the tilting-field</a>
<a id='line_10219'>  Forbore his own advantage, and the King</a>
<a id='line_10220'>  In open battle or the tilting-field</a>
<a id='line_10221'>  Forbore his own advantage, and these two</a>
<a id='line_10222'>  Were the most nobly-mannered men of all;</a>
<a id='line_10223'>  For manners are not idle, but the fruit</a>
<a id='line_10224'>  Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.'</a>
<a id='line_10225'></a>
<a id='line_10226'>     'Yea,' said the maid, 'be manners such fair fruit?'</a>
<a id='line_10227'>  Then Lancelot's needs must be a thousand-fold</a>
<a id='line_10228'>  Less noble, being, as all rumour runs,</a>
<a id='line_10229'>  The most disloyal friend in all the world.'</a>
<a id='line_10230'></a>
<a id='line_10231'>     To which a mournful answer made the Queen:</a>
<a id='line_10232'>  'O closed about by narrowing nunnery-walls,</a>
<a id='line_10233'>  What knowest thou of the world, and all its lights</a>
<a id='line_10234'>  And shadows, all the wealth and all the woe?</a>
<a id='line_10235'>  If ever Lancelot, that most noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_10236'>  Were for one hour less noble than himself,</a>
<a id='line_10237'>  Pray for him that he scape the doom of fire,</a>
<a id='line_10238'>  And weep for her that drew him to his doom.'</a>
<a id='line_10239'></a>
<a id='line_10240'>     'Yea,' said the little novice, 'I pray for both;</a>
<a id='line_10241'>  But I should all as soon believe that his,</a>
<a id='line_10242'>  Sir Lancelot's, were as noble as the King's,</a>
<a id='line_10243'>  As I could think, sweet lady, yours would be</a>
<a id='line_10244'>  Such as they are, were you the sinful Queen.'</a>
<a id='line_10245'></a>
<a id='line_10246'>     So she, like many another babbler, hurt</a>
<a id='line_10247'>  Whom she would soothe, and harmed where she would heal;</a>
<a id='line_10248'>  For here a sudden flush of wrathful heat</a>
<a id='line_10249'>  Fired all the pale face of the Queen, who cried,</a>
<a id='line_10250'>  'Such as thou art be never maiden more</a>
<a id='line_10251'>  For ever! thou their tool, set on to plague</a>
<a id='line_10252'>  And play upon, and harry me, petty spy</a>
<a id='line_10253'>  And traitress.'  When that storm of anger brake</a>
<a id='line_10254'>  From Guinevere, aghast the maiden rose,</a>
<a id='line_10255'>  White as her veil, and stood before the Queen</a>
<a id='line_10256'>  As tremulously as foam upon the beach</a>
<a id='line_10257'>  Stands in a wind, ready to break and fly,</a>
<a id='line_10258'>  And when the Queen had added 'Get thee hence,'</a>
<a id='line_10259'>  Fled frighted.  Then that other left alone</a>
<a id='line_10260'>  Sighed, and began to gather heart again,</a>
<a id='line_10261'>  Saying in herself, 'The simple, fearful child</a>
<a id='line_10262'>  Meant nothing, but my own too-fearful guilt,</a>
<a id='line_10263'>  Simpler than any child, betrays itself.</a>
<a id='line_10264'>  But help me, heaven, for surely I repent.</a>
<a id='line_10265'>  For what is true repentance but in thought--</a>
<a id='line_10266'>  Not even in inmost thought to think again</a>
<a id='line_10267'>  The sins that made the past so pleasant to us:</a>
<a id='line_10268'>  And I have sworn never to see him more,</a>
<a id='line_10269'>  To see him more.'</a>
<a id='line_10270'></a>
<a id='line_10271'>                   And even in saying this,</a>
<a id='line_10272'>  Her memory from old habit of the mind</a>
<a id='line_10273'>  Went slipping back upon the golden days</a>
<a id='line_10274'>  In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came,</a>
<a id='line_10275'>  Reputed the best knight and goodliest man,</a>
<a id='line_10276'>  Ambassador, to lead her to his lord</a>
<a id='line_10277'>  Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead</a>
<a id='line_10278'>  Of his and her retinue moving, they,</a>
<a id='line_10279'>  Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love</a>
<a id='line_10280'>  And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time</a>
<a id='line_10281'>  Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed,)</a>
<a id='line_10282'>  Rode under groves that looked a paradise</a>
<a id='line_10283'>  Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth</a>
<a id='line_10284'>  That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth,</a>
<a id='line_10285'>  And on from hill to hill, and every day</a>
<a id='line_10286'>  Beheld at noon in some delicious dale</a>
<a id='line_10287'>  The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised</a>
<a id='line_10288'>  For brief repast or afternoon repose</a>
<a id='line_10289'>  By couriers gone before; and on again,</a>
<a id='line_10290'>  Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw</a>
<a id='line_10291'>  The Dragon of the great Pendragonship,</a>
<a id='line_10292'>  That crowned the state pavilion of the King,</a>
<a id='line_10293'>  Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well.</a>
<a id='line_10294'></a>
<a id='line_10295'>     But when the Queen immersed in such a trance,</a>
<a id='line_10296'>  And moving through the past unconsciously,</a>
<a id='line_10297'>  Came to that point where first she saw the King</a>
<a id='line_10298'>  Ride toward her from the city, sighed to find</a>
<a id='line_10299'>  Her journey done, glanced at him, thought him cold,</a>
<a id='line_10300'>  High, self-contained, and passionless, not like him,</a>
<a id='line_10301'>  'Not like my Lancelot'--while she brooded thus</a>
<a id='line_10302'>  And grew half-guilty in her thoughts again,</a>
<a id='line_10303'>  There rode an armed warrior to the doors.</a>
<a id='line_10304'>  A murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran,</a>
<a id='line_10305'>  Then on a sudden a cry, 'The King.'  She sat</a>
<a id='line_10306'>  Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armed feet</a>
<a id='line_10307'>  Through the long gallery from the outer doors</a>
<a id='line_10308'>  Rang coming, prone from off her seat she fell,</a>
<a id='line_10309'>  And grovelled with her face against the floor:</a>
<a id='line_10310'>  There with her milkwhite arms and shadowy hair</a>
<a id='line_10311'>  She made her face a darkness from the King:</a>
<a id='line_10312'>  And in the darkness heard his armed feet</a>
<a id='line_10313'>  Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,</a>
<a id='line_10314'>  Monotonous and hollow like a Ghost's</a>
<a id='line_10315'>  Denouncing judgment, but though changed, the King's:</a>
<a id='line_10316'></a>
<a id='line_10317'>     'Liest thou here so low, the child of one</a>
<a id='line_10318'>  I honoured, happy, dead before thy shame?</a>
<a id='line_10319'>  Well is it that no child is born of thee.</a>
<a id='line_10320'>  The children born of thee are sword and fire,</a>
<a id='line_10321'>  Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws,</a>
<a id='line_10322'>  The craft of kindred and the Godless hosts</a>
<a id='line_10323'>  Of heathen swarming o'er the Northern Sea;</a>
<a id='line_10324'>  Whom I, while yet Sir Lancelot, my right arm,</a>
<a id='line_10325'>  The mightiest of my knights, abode with me,</a>
<a id='line_10326'>  Have everywhere about this land of Christ</a>
<a id='line_10327'>  In twelve great battles ruining overthrown.</a>
<a id='line_10328'>  And knowest thou now from whence I come--from him</a>
<a id='line_10329'>  From waging bitter war with him:  and he,</a>
<a id='line_10330'>  That did not shun to smite me in worse way,</a>
<a id='line_10331'>  Had yet that grace of courtesy in him left,</a>
<a id='line_10332'>  He spared to lift his hand against the King</a>
<a id='line_10333'>  Who made him knight:  but many a knight was slain;</a>
<a id='line_10334'>  And many more, and all his kith and kin</a>
<a id='line_10335'>  Clave to him, and abode in his own land.</a>
<a id='line_10336'>  And many more when Modred raised revolt,</a>
<a id='line_10337'>  Forgetful of their troth and fealty, clave</a>
<a id='line_10338'>  To Modred, and a remnant stays with me.</a>
<a id='line_10339'>  And of this remnant will I leave a part,</a>
<a id='line_10340'>  True men who love me still, for whom I live,</a>
<a id='line_10341'>  To guard thee in the wild hour coming on,</a>
<a id='line_10342'>  Lest but a hair of this low head be harmed.</a>
<a id='line_10343'>  Fear not:  thou shalt be guarded till my death.</a>
<a id='line_10344'>  Howbeit I know, if ancient prophecies</a>
<a id='line_10345'>  Have erred not, that I march to meet my doom.</a>
<a id='line_10346'>  Thou hast not made my life so sweet to me,</a>
<a id='line_10347'>  That I the King should greatly care to live;</a>
<a id='line_10348'>  For thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life.</a>
<a id='line_10349'>  Bear with me for the last time while I show,</a>
<a id='line_10350'>  Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned.</a>
<a id='line_10351'>  For when the Roman left us, and their law</a>
<a id='line_10352'>  Relaxed its hold upon us, and the ways</a>
<a id='line_10353'>  Were filled with rapine, here and there a deed</a>
<a id='line_10354'>  Of prowess done redressed a random wrong.</a>
<a id='line_10355'>  But I was first of all the kings who drew</a>
<a id='line_10356'>  The knighthood-errant of this realm and all</a>
<a id='line_10357'>  The realms together under me, their Head,</a>
<a id='line_10358'>  In that fair Order of my Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_10359'>  A glorious company, the flower of men,</a>
<a id='line_10360'>  To serve as model for the mighty world,</a>
<a id='line_10361'>  And be the fair beginning of a time.</a>
<a id='line_10362'>  I made them lay their hands in mine and swear</a>
<a id='line_10363'>  To reverence the King, as if he were</a>
<a id='line_10364'>  Their conscience, and their conscience as their King,</a>
<a id='line_10365'>  To break the heathen and uphold the Christ,</a>
<a id='line_10366'>  To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,</a>
<a id='line_10367'>  To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,</a>
<a id='line_10368'>  To honour his own word as if his God's,</a>
<a id='line_10369'>  To lead sweet lives in purest chastity,</a>
<a id='line_10370'>  To love one maiden only, cleave to her,</a>
<a id='line_10371'>  And worship her by years of noble deeds,</a>
<a id='line_10372'>  Until they won her; for indeed I knew</a>
<a id='line_10373'>  Of no more subtle master under heaven</a>
<a id='line_10374'>  Than is the maiden passion for a maid,</a>
<a id='line_10375'>  Not only to keep down the base in man,</a>
<a id='line_10376'>  But teach high thought, and amiable words</a>
<a id='line_10377'>  And courtliness, and the desire of fame,</a>
<a id='line_10378'>  And love of truth, and all that makes a man.</a>
<a id='line_10379'>  And all this throve before I wedded thee,</a>
<a id='line_10380'>  Believing, "lo mine helpmate, one to feel</a>
<a id='line_10381'>  My purpose and rejoicing in my joy."</a>
<a id='line_10382'>  Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot;</a>
<a id='line_10383'>  Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt;</a>
<a id='line_10384'>  Then others, following these my mightiest knights,</a>
<a id='line_10385'>  And drawing foul ensample from fair names,</a>
<a id='line_10386'>  Sinned also, till the loathsome opposite</a>
<a id='line_10387'>  Of all my heart had destined did obtain,</a>
<a id='line_10388'>  And all through thee! so that this life of mine</a>
<a id='line_10389'>  I guard as God's high gift from scathe and wrong,</a>
<a id='line_10390'>  Not greatly care to lose; but rather think</a>
<a id='line_10391'>  How sad it were for Arthur, should he live,</a>
<a id='line_10392'>  To sit once more within his lonely hall,</a>
<a id='line_10393'>  And miss the wonted number of my knights,</a>
<a id='line_10394'>  And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds</a>
<a id='line_10395'>  As in the golden days before thy sin.</a>
<a id='line_10396'>  For which of us, who might be left, could speak</a>
<a id='line_10397'>  Of the pure heart, nor seem to glance at thee?</a>
<a id='line_10398'>  And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk</a>
<a id='line_10399'>  Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,</a>
<a id='line_10400'>  And I should evermore be vext with thee</a>
<a id='line_10401'>  In hanging robe or vacant ornament,</a>
<a id='line_10402'>  Or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair.</a>
<a id='line_10403'>  For think not, though thou wouldst not love thy lord,</a>
<a id='line_10404'>  Thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee.</a>
<a id='line_10405'>  I am not made of so slight elements.</a>
<a id='line_10406'>  Yet must I leave thee, woman, to thy shame.</a>
<a id='line_10407'>  I hold that man the worst of public foes</a>
<a id='line_10408'>  Who either for his own or children's sake,</a>
<a id='line_10409'>  To save his blood from scandal, lets the wife</a>
<a id='line_10410'>  Whom he knows false, abide and rule the house:</a>
<a id='line_10411'>  For being through his cowardice allowed</a>
<a id='line_10412'>  Her station, taken everywhere for pure,</a>
<a id='line_10413'>  She like a new disease, unknown to men,</a>
<a id='line_10414'>  Creeps, no precaution used, among the crowd,</a>
<a id='line_10415'>  Makes wicked lightnings of her eyes, and saps</a>
<a id='line_10416'>  The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse</a>
<a id='line_10417'>  With devil's leaps, and poisons half the young.</a>
<a id='line_10418'>  Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns!</a>
<a id='line_10419'>  Better the King's waste hearth and aching heart</a>
<a id='line_10420'>  Than thou reseated in thy place of light,</a>
<a id='line_10421'>  The mockery of my people, and their bane.'</a>
<a id='line_10422'></a>
<a id='line_10423'>     He paused, and in the pause she crept an inch</a>
<a id='line_10424'>  Nearer, and laid her hands about his feet.</a>
<a id='line_10425'>  Far off a solitary trumpet blew.</a>
<a id='line_10426'>  Then waiting by the doors the warhorse neighed</a>
<a id='line_10427'>  At a friend's voice, and he spake again:</a>
<a id='line_10428'></a>
<a id='line_10429'>     'Yet think not that I come to urge thy crimes,</a>
<a id='line_10430'>  I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_10431'>  I, whose vast pity almost makes me die</a>
<a id='line_10432'>  To see thee, laying there thy golden head,</a>
<a id='line_10433'>  My pride in happier summers, at my feet.</a>
<a id='line_10434'>  The wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law,</a>
<a id='line_10435'>  The doom of treason and the flaming death,</a>
<a id='line_10436'>  (When first I learnt thee hidden here) is past.</a>
<a id='line_10437'>  The pang--which while I weighed thy heart with one</a>
<a id='line_10438'>  Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee,</a>
<a id='line_10439'>  Made my tears burn--is also past--in part.</a>
<a id='line_10440'>  And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I,</a>
<a id='line_10441'>  Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God</a>
<a id='line_10442'>  Forgives:  do thou for thine own soul the rest.</a>
<a id='line_10443'>  But how to take last leave of all I loved?</a>
<a id='line_10444'>  O golden hair, with which I used to play</a>
<a id='line_10445'>  Not knowing! O imperial-moulded form,</a>
<a id='line_10446'>  And beauty such as never woman wore,</a>
<a id='line_10447'>  Until it became a kingdom's curse with thee--</a>
<a id='line_10448'>  I cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine,</a>
<a id='line_10449'>  But Lancelot's:  nay, they never were the King's.</a>
<a id='line_10450'>  I cannot take thy hand:  that too is flesh,</a>
<a id='line_10451'>  And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh,</a>
<a id='line_10452'>  Here looking down on thine polluted, cries</a>
<a id='line_10453'>  "I loathe thee:" yet not less, O Guinevere,</a>
<a id='line_10454'>  For I was ever virgin save for thee,</a>
<a id='line_10455'>  My love through flesh hath wrought into my life</a>
<a id='line_10456'>  So far, that my doom is, I love thee still.</a>
<a id='line_10457'>  Let no man dream but that I love thee still.</a>
<a id='line_10458'>  Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul,</a>
<a id='line_10459'>  And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,</a>
<a id='line_10460'>  Hereafter in that world where all are pure</a>
<a id='line_10461'>  We two may meet before high God, and thou</a>
<a id='line_10462'>  Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know</a>
<a id='line_10463'>  I am thine husband--not a smaller soul,</a>
<a id='line_10464'>  Nor Lancelot, nor another.  Leave me that,</a>
<a id='line_10465'>  I charge thee, my last hope.  Now must I hence.</a>
<a id='line_10466'>  Through the thick night I hear the trumpet blow:</a>
<a id='line_10467'>  They summon me their King to lead mine hosts</a>
<a id='line_10468'>  Far down to that great battle in the west,</a>
<a id='line_10469'>  Where I must strike against the man they call</a>
<a id='line_10470'>  My sister's son--no kin of mine, who leagues</a>
<a id='line_10471'>  With Lords of the White Horse, heathen, and knights,</a>
<a id='line_10472'>  Traitors--and strike him dead, and meet myself</a>
<a id='line_10473'>  Death, or I know not what mysterious doom.</a>
<a id='line_10474'>  And thou remaining here wilt learn the event;</a>
<a id='line_10475'>  But hither shall I never come again,</a>
<a id='line_10476'>  Never lie by thy side; see thee no more--</a>
<a id='line_10477'>  Farewell!'</a>
<a id='line_10478'></a>
<a id='line_10479'>            And while she grovelled at his feet,</a>
<a id='line_10480'>  She felt the King's breath wander o'er her neck,</a>
<a id='line_10481'>  And in the darkness o'er her fallen head,</a>
<a id='line_10482'>  Perceived the waving of his hands that blest.</a>
<a id='line_10483'></a>
<a id='line_10484'>     Then, listening till those armed steps were gone,</a>
<a id='line_10485'>  Rose the pale Queen, and in her anguish found</a>
<a id='line_10486'>  The casement:  'peradventure,' so she thought,</a>
<a id='line_10487'>  'If I might see his face, and not be seen.'</a>
<a id='line_10488'>  And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!</a>
<a id='line_10489'>  And near him the sad nuns with each a light</a>
<a id='line_10490'>  Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_10491'>  To guard and foster her for evermore.</a>
<a id='line_10492'>  And while he spake to these his helm was lowered,</a>
<a id='line_10493'>  To which for crest the golden dragon clung</a>
<a id='line_10494'>  Of Britain; so she did not see the face,</a>
<a id='line_10495'>  Which then was as an angel's, but she saw,</a>
<a id='line_10496'>  Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights,</a>
<a id='line_10497'>  The Dragon of the great Pendragonship</a>
<a id='line_10498'>  Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire.</a>
<a id='line_10499'>  And even then he turned; and more and more</a>
<a id='line_10500'>  The moony vapour rolling round the King,</a>
<a id='line_10501'>  Who seemed the phantom of a Giant in it,</a>
<a id='line_10502'>  Enwound him fold by fold, and made him gray</a>
<a id='line_10503'>  And grayer, till himself became as mist</a>
<a id='line_10504'>  Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.</a>
<a id='line_10505'></a>
<a id='line_10506'>     Then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud</a>
<a id='line_10507'>  'Oh Arthur!' there her voice brake suddenly,</a>
<a id='line_10508'>  Then--as a stream that spouting from a cliff</a>
<a id='line_10509'>  Fails in mid air, but gathering at the base</a>
<a id='line_10510'>  Re-makes itself, and flashes down the vale--</a>
<a id='line_10511'>  Went on in passionate utterance:</a>
<a id='line_10512'></a>
<a id='line_10513'>                                  'Gone--my lord!</a>
<a id='line_10514'>  Gone through my sin to slay and to be slain!</a>
<a id='line_10515'>  And he forgave me, and I could not speak.</a>
<a id='line_10516'>  Farewell?  I should have answered his farewell.</a>
<a id='line_10517'>  His mercy choked me.  Gone, my lord the King,</a>
<a id='line_10518'>  My own true lord! how dare I call him mine?</a>
<a id='line_10519'>  The shadow of another cleaves to me,</a>
<a id='line_10520'>  And makes me one pollution:  he, the King,</a>
<a id='line_10521'>  Called me polluted:  shall I kill myself?</a>
<a id='line_10522'>  What help in that?  I cannot kill my sin,</a>
<a id='line_10523'>  If soul be soul; nor can I kill my shame;</a>
<a id='line_10524'>  No, nor by living can I live it down.</a>
<a id='line_10525'>  The days will grow to weeks, the weeks to months</a>
<a id='line_10526'>  The months will add themselves and make the years,</a>
<a id='line_10527'>  The years will roll into the centuries,</a>
<a id='line_10528'>  And mine will ever be a name of scorn.</a>
<a id='line_10529'>  I must not dwell on that defeat of fame.</a>
<a id='line_10530'>  Let the world be; that is but of the world.</a>
<a id='line_10531'>  What else? what hope? I think there was a hope,</a>
<a id='line_10532'>  Except he mocked me when he spake of hope;</a>
<a id='line_10533'>  His hope he called it; but he never mocks,</a>
<a id='line_10534'>  For mockery is the fume of little hearts.</a>
<a id='line_10535'>  And blessed be the King, who hath forgiven</a>
<a id='line_10536'>  My wickedness to him, and left me hope</a>
<a id='line_10537'>  That in mine own heart I can live down sin</a>
<a id='line_10538'>  And be his mate hereafter in the heavens</a>
<a id='line_10539'>  Before high God.  Ah great and gentle lord,</a>
<a id='line_10540'>  Who wast, as is the conscience of a saint</a>
<a id='line_10541'>  Among his warring senses, to thy knights--</a>
<a id='line_10542'>  To whom my false voluptuous pride, that took</a>
<a id='line_10543'>  Full easily all impressions from below,</a>
<a id='line_10544'>  Would not look up, or half-despised the height</a>
<a id='line_10545'>  To which I would not or I could not climb--</a>
<a id='line_10546'>  I thought I could not breathe in that fine air</a>
<a id='line_10547'>  That pure severity of perfect light--</a>
<a id='line_10548'>  I yearned for warmth and colour which I found</a>
<a id='line_10549'>  In Lancelot--now I see thee what thou art,</a>
<a id='line_10550'>  Thou art the highest and most human too,</a>
<a id='line_10551'>  Not Lancelot, nor another.  Is there none</a>
<a id='line_10552'>  Will tell the King I love him though so late?</a>
<a id='line_10553'>  Now--ere he goes to the great Battle? none:</a>
<a id='line_10554'>  Myself must tell him in that purer life,</a>
<a id='line_10555'>  But now it were too daring.  Ah my God,</a>
<a id='line_10556'>  What might I not have made of thy fair world,</a>
<a id='line_10557'>  Had I but loved thy highest creature here?</a>
<a id='line_10558'>  It was my duty to have loved the highest:</a>
<a id='line_10559'>  It surely was my profit had I known:</a>
<a id='line_10560'>  It would have been my pleasure had I seen.</a>
<a id='line_10561'>  We needs must love the highest when we see it,</a>
<a id='line_10562'>  Not Lancelot, nor another.'</a>
<a id='line_10563'></a>
<a id='line_10564'>                             Here her hand</a>
<a id='line_10565'>  Grasped, made her vail her eyes:  she looked and saw</a>
<a id='line_10566'>  The novice, weeping, suppliant, and said to her,</a>
<a id='line_10567'>  'Yea, little maid, for am I not forgiven?'</a>
<a id='line_10568'>  Then glancing up beheld the holy nuns</a>
<a id='line_10569'>  All round her, weeping; and her heart was loosed</a>
<a id='line_10570'>  Within her, and she wept with these and said,</a>
<a id='line_10571'></a>
<a id='line_10572'>     'Ye know me then, that wicked one, who broke</a>
<a id='line_10573'>  The vast design and purpose of the King.</a>
<a id='line_10574'>  O shut me round with narrowing nunnery-walls,</a>
<a id='line_10575'>  Meek maidens, from the voices crying "shame."</a>
<a id='line_10576'>  I must not scorn myself:  he loves me still.</a>
<a id='line_10577'>  Let no one dream but that he loves me still.</a>
<a id='line_10578'>  So let me, if you do not shudder at me,</a>
<a id='line_10579'>  Nor shun to call me sister, dwell with you;</a>
<a id='line_10580'>  Wear black and white, and be a nun like you,</a>
<a id='line_10581'>  Fast with your fasts, not feasting with your feasts;</a>
<a id='line_10582'>  Grieve with your griefs, not grieving at your joys,</a>
<a id='line_10583'>  But not rejoicing; mingle with your rites;</a>
<a id='line_10584'>  Pray and be prayed for; lie before your shrines;</a>
<a id='line_10585'>  Do each low office of your holy house;</a>
<a id='line_10586'>  Walk your dim cloister, and distribute dole</a>
<a id='line_10587'>  To poor sick people, richer in His eyes</a>
<a id='line_10588'>  Who ransomed us, and haler too than I;</a>
<a id='line_10589'>  And treat their loathsome hurts and heal mine own;</a>
<a id='line_10590'>  And so wear out in almsdeed and in prayer</a>
<a id='line_10591'>  The sombre close of that voluptuous day,</a>
<a id='line_10592'>  Which wrought the ruin of my lord the King.'</a>
<a id='line_10593'></a>
<a id='line_10594'>     She said:  they took her to themselves; and she</a>
<a id='line_10595'>  Still hoping, fearing 'is it yet too late?'</a>
<a id='line_10596'>  Dwelt with them, till in time their Abbess died.</a>
<a id='line_10597'>  Then she, for her good deeds and her pure life,</a>
<a id='line_10598'>  And for the power of ministration in her,</a>
<a id='line_10599'>  And likewise for the high rank she had borne,</a>
<a id='line_10600'>  Was chosen Abbess, there, an Abbess, lived</a>
<a id='line_10601'>  For three brief years, and there, an Abbess, past</a>
<a id='line_10602'>  To where beyond these voices there is peace.</a>
<a id='line_10603'></a>
<a id='line_10604'></a>
<a id='line_10605'></a>
<a id='line_10606'>  The Passing of Arthur</a>
<a id='line_10607'></a>
<a id='line_10608'>  That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,</a>
<a id='line_10609'>  First made and latest left of all the knights,</a>
<a id='line_10610'>  Told, when the man was no more than a voice</a>
<a id='line_10611'>  In the white winter of his age, to those</a>
<a id='line_10612'>  With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.</a>
<a id='line_10613'></a>
<a id='line_10614'>     For on their march to westward, Bedivere,</a>
<a id='line_10615'>  Who slowly paced among the slumbering host,</a>
<a id='line_10616'>  Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:</a>
<a id='line_10617'></a>
<a id='line_10618'>     'I found Him in the shining of the stars,</a>
<a id='line_10619'>  I marked Him in the flowering of His fields,</a>
<a id='line_10620'>  But in His ways with men I find Him not.</a>
<a id='line_10621'>  I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.</a>
<a id='line_10622'>  O me! for why is all around us here</a>
<a id='line_10623'>  As if some lesser god had made the world,</a>
<a id='line_10624'>  But had not force to shape it as he would,</a>
<a id='line_10625'>  Till the High God behold it from beyond,</a>
<a id='line_10626'>  And enter it, and make it beautiful?</a>
<a id='line_10627'>  Or else as if the world were wholly fair,</a>
<a id='line_10628'>  But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,</a>
<a id='line_10629'>  And have not power to see it as it is:</a>
<a id='line_10630'>  Perchance, because we see not to the close;--</a>
<a id='line_10631'>  For I, being simple, thought to work His will,</a>
<a id='line_10632'>  And have but stricken with the sword in vain;</a>
<a id='line_10633'>  And all whereon I leaned in wife and friend</a>
<a id='line_10634'>  Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm</a>
<a id='line_10635'>  Reels back into the beast, and is no more.</a>
<a id='line_10636'>  My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death;</a>
<a id='line_10637'>  Nay--God my Christ--I pass but shall not die.'</a>
<a id='line_10638'></a>
<a id='line_10639'>     Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,</a>
<a id='line_10640'>  There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain killed</a>
<a id='line_10641'>  In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown</a>
<a id='line_10642'>  Along a wandering wind, and past his ear</a>
<a id='line_10643'>  Went shrilling, 'Hollow, hollow all delight!</a>
<a id='line_10644'>  Hail, King! tomorrow thou shalt pass away.</a>
<a id='line_10645'>  Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.</a>
<a id='line_10646'>  And I am blown along a wandering wind,</a>
<a id='line_10647'>  And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight.'</a>
<a id='line_10648'>  And fainter onward, like wild birds that change</a>
<a id='line_10649'>  Their season in the night and wail their way</a>
<a id='line_10650'>  From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream</a>
<a id='line_10651'>  Shrilled; but in going mingled with dim cries</a>
<a id='line_10652'>  Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,</a>
<a id='line_10653'>  As of some lonely city sacked by night,</a>
<a id='line_10654'>  When all is lost, and wife and child with wail</a>
<a id='line_10655'>  Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and called,</a>
<a id='line_10656'>  'Who spake?  A dream.  O light upon the wind,</a>
<a id='line_10657'>  Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim cries</a>
<a id='line_10658'>  Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild</a>
<a id='line_10659'>  Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?'</a>
<a id='line_10660'></a>
<a id='line_10661'>     This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:</a>
<a id='line_10662'>  'O me, my King, let pass whatever will,</a>
<a id='line_10663'>  Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;</a>
<a id='line_10664'>  But in their stead thy name and glory cling</a>
<a id='line_10665'>  To all high places like a golden cloud</a>
<a id='line_10666'>  For ever:  but as yet thou shalt not pass.</a>
<a id='line_10667'>  Light was Gawain in life, and light in death</a>
<a id='line_10668'>  Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;</a>
<a id='line_10669'>  And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise--</a>
<a id='line_10670'>  I hear the steps of Modred in the west,</a>
<a id='line_10671'>  And with him many of thy people, and knights</a>
<a id='line_10672'>  Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown</a>
<a id='line_10673'>  Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.</a>
<a id='line_10674'>  Right well in heart they know thee for the King.</a>
<a id='line_10675'>  Arise, go forth and conquer as of old.'</a>
<a id='line_10676'></a>
<a id='line_10677'>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10678'>  'Far other is this battle in the west</a>
<a id='line_10679'>  Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,</a>
<a id='line_10680'>  And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,</a>
<a id='line_10681'>  Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,</a>
<a id='line_10682'>  And shook him through the north.  Ill doom is mine</a>
<a id='line_10683'>  To war against my people and my knights.</a>
<a id='line_10684'>  The king who fights his people fights himself.</a>
<a id='line_10685'>  And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke</a>
<a id='line_10686'>  That strikes them dead is as my death to me.</a>
<a id='line_10687'>  Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way</a>
<a id='line_10688'>  Through this blind haze, which ever since I saw</a>
<a id='line_10689'>  One lying in the dust at Almesbury,</a>
<a id='line_10690'>  Hath folded in the passes of the world.'</a>
<a id='line_10691'></a>
<a id='line_10692'>     Then rose the King and moved his host by night,</a>
<a id='line_10693'>  And ever pushed Sir Modred, league by league,</a>
<a id='line_10694'>  Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse--</a>
<a id='line_10695'>  A land of old upheaven from the abyss</a>
<a id='line_10696'>  By fire, to sink into the abyss again;</a>
<a id='line_10697'>  Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,</a>
<a id='line_10698'>  And the long mountains ended in a coast</a>
<a id='line_10699'>  Of ever-shifting sand, and far away</a>
<a id='line_10700'>  The phantom circle of a moaning sea.</a>
<a id='line_10701'>  There the pursuer could pursue no more,</a>
<a id='line_10702'>  And he that fled no further fly the King;</a>
<a id='line_10703'>  And there, that day when the great light of heaven</a>
<a id='line_10704'>  Burned at his lowest in the rolling year,</a>
<a id='line_10705'>  On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.</a>
<a id='line_10706'>  Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight</a>
<a id='line_10707'>  Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.</a>
<a id='line_10708'>  A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea:</a>
<a id='line_10709'>  Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew</a>
<a id='line_10710'>  Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold</a>
<a id='line_10711'>  With formless fear; and even on Arthur fell</a>
<a id='line_10712'>  Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.</a>
<a id='line_10713'>  For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,</a>
<a id='line_10714'>  And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;</a>
<a id='line_10715'>  And some had visions out of golden youth,</a>
<a id='line_10716'>  And some beheld the faces of old ghosts</a>
<a id='line_10717'>  Look in upon the battle; and in the mist</a>
<a id='line_10718'>  Was many a noble deed, many a base,</a>
<a id='line_10719'>  And chance and craft and strength in single fights,</a>
<a id='line_10720'>  And ever and anon with host to host</a>
<a id='line_10721'>  Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,</a>
<a id='line_10722'>  Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash</a>
<a id='line_10723'>  Of battleaxes on shattered helms, and shrieks</a>
<a id='line_10724'>  After the Christ, of those who falling down</a>
<a id='line_10725'>  Looked up for heaven, and only saw the mist;</a>
<a id='line_10726'>  And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,</a>
<a id='line_10727'>  Oaths, insults, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,</a>
<a id='line_10728'>  Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs</a>
<a id='line_10729'>  In that close mist, and cryings for the light,</a>
<a id='line_10730'>  Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_10731'></a>
<a id='line_10732'>     Last, as by some one deathbed after wail</a>
<a id='line_10733'>  Of suffering, silence follows, or through death</a>
<a id='line_10734'>  Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,</a>
<a id='line_10735'>  Save for some whisper of the seething seas,</a>
<a id='line_10736'>  A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day</a>
<a id='line_10737'>  Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came</a>
<a id='line_10738'>  A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew</a>
<a id='line_10739'>  The mist aside, and with that wind the tide</a>
<a id='line_10740'>  Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field</a>
<a id='line_10741'>  Of battle:  but no man was moving there;</a>
<a id='line_10742'>  Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,</a>
<a id='line_10743'>  Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave</a>
<a id='line_10744'>  Brake in among dead faces, to and fro</a>
<a id='line_10745'>  Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down</a>
<a id='line_10746'>  Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,</a>
<a id='line_10747'>  And shivered brands that once had fought with Rome,</a>
<a id='line_10748'>  And rolling far along the gloomy shores</a>
<a id='line_10749'>  The voice of days of old and days to be.</a>
<a id='line_10750'></a>
<a id='line_10751'>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,</a>
<a id='line_10752'>  And whiter than the mist that all day long</a>
<a id='line_10753'>  Had held the field of battle was the King:</a>
<a id='line_10754'></a>
<a id='line_10755'>     'Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,</a>
<a id='line_10756'>  And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,</a>
<a id='line_10757'>  And beats upon the faces of the dead,</a>
<a id='line_10758'>  My dead, as though they had not died for me?--</a>
<a id='line_10759'>  O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fallen</a>
<a id='line_10760'>  Confusion, till I know not what I am,</a>
<a id='line_10761'>  Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.</a>
<a id='line_10762'>  Behold, I seem but King among the dead.'</a>
<a id='line_10763'></a>
<a id='line_10764'>     Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere:  'My King,</a>
<a id='line_10765'>  King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,</a>
<a id='line_10766'>  There also will I worship thee as King.</a>
<a id='line_10767'>  Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live</a>
<a id='line_10768'>  Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought</a>
<a id='line_10769'>  The heathen back among us, yonder stands,</a>
<a id='line_10770'>  Modred, unharmed, the traitor of thine house.'</a>
<a id='line_10771'></a>
<a id='line_10772'>     Then spake the King:  'My house hath been my doom.</a>
<a id='line_10773'>  But call not thou this traitor of my house</a>
<a id='line_10774'>  Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.</a>
<a id='line_10775'>  My house are rather they who sware my vows,</a>
<a id='line_10776'>  Yea, even while they brake them, owned me King.</a>
<a id='line_10777'>  And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,</a>
<a id='line_10778'>  When all the purport of my throne hath failed,</a>
<a id='line_10779'>  That quick or dead thou holdest me for King.</a>
<a id='line_10780'>  King am I, whatsoever be their cry;</a>
<a id='line_10781'>  And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see</a>
<a id='line_10782'>  Yet, ere I pass.'  And uttering this the King</a>
<a id='line_10783'>  Made at the man:  then Modred smote his liege</a>
<a id='line_10784'>  Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword</a>
<a id='line_10785'>  Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,</a>
<a id='line_10786'>  Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_10787'>  Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.</a>
<a id='line_10788'></a>
<a id='line_10789'>     So all day long the noise of battle rolled</a>
<a id='line_10790'>  Among the mountains by the winter sea;</a>
<a id='line_10791'>  Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,</a>
<a id='line_10792'>  Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their lord,</a>
<a id='line_10793'>  King Arthur.  Then, because his wound was deep,</a>
<a id='line_10794'>  The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,</a>
<a id='line_10795'>  And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,</a>
<a id='line_10796'>  A broken chancel with a broken cross,</a>
<a id='line_10797'>  That stood on a dark strait of barren land:</a>
<a id='line_10798'>  On one side lay the Ocean, and on one</a>
<a id='line_10799'>  Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</a>
<a id='line_10800'></a>
<a id='line_10801'>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10802'>  'The sequel of today unsolders all</a>
<a id='line_10803'>  The goodliest fellowship of famous knights</a>
<a id='line_10804'>  Whereof this world holds record.  Such a sleep</a>
<a id='line_10805'>  They sleep--the men I loved.  I think that we</a>
<a id='line_10806'>  Shall never more, at any future time,</a>
<a id='line_10807'>  Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,</a>
<a id='line_10808'>  Walking about the gardens and the halls</a>
<a id='line_10809'>  Of Camelot, as in the days that were.</a>
<a id='line_10810'>  I perish by this people which I made,--</a>
<a id='line_10811'>  Though Merlin sware that I should come again</a>
<a id='line_10812'>  To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,</a>
<a id='line_10813'>  I am so deeply smitten through the helm</a>
<a id='line_10814'>  That without help I cannot last till morn.</a>
<a id='line_10815'>  Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_10816'>  Which was my pride:  for thou rememberest how</a>
<a id='line_10817'>  In those old days, one summer noon, an arm</a>
<a id='line_10818'>  Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,</a>
<a id='line_10819'>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</a>
<a id='line_10820'>  Holding the sword--and how I rowed across</a>
<a id='line_10821'>  And took it, and have worn it, like a king;</a>
<a id='line_10822'>  And, wheresoever I am sung or told</a>
<a id='line_10823'>  In aftertime, this also shall be known:</a>
<a id='line_10824'>  But now delay not:  take Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_10825'>  And fling him far into the middle mere:</a>
<a id='line_10826'>  Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.'</a>
<a id='line_10827'></a>
<a id='line_10828'>     To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10829'>  'It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,</a>
<a id='line_10830'>  Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm--</a>
<a id='line_10831'>  A little thing may harm a wounded man;</a>
<a id='line_10832'>  Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,</a>
<a id='line_10833'>  Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.'</a>
<a id='line_10834'></a>
<a id='line_10835'>     So saying, from the ruined shrine he stept,</a>
<a id='line_10836'>  And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,</a>
<a id='line_10837'>  Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,</a>
<a id='line_10838'>  Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang</a>
<a id='line_10839'>  Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam.  He, stepping down</a>
<a id='line_10840'>  By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,</a>
<a id='line_10841'>  Came on the shining levels of the lake.</a>
<a id='line_10842'></a>
<a id='line_10843'>     There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_10844'>  And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,</a>
<a id='line_10845'>  Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth</a>
<a id='line_10846'>  And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:</a>
<a id='line_10847'>  For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,</a>
<a id='line_10848'>  Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work</a>
<a id='line_10849'>  Of subtlest jewellery.  He gazed so long</a>
<a id='line_10850'>  That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,</a>
<a id='line_10851'>  This way and that dividing the swift mind,</a>
<a id='line_10852'>  In act to throw:  but at the last it seemed</a>
<a id='line_10853'>  Better to leave Excalibur concealed</a>
<a id='line_10854'>  There in the many-knotted waterflags,</a>
<a id='line_10855'>  That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.</a>
<a id='line_10856'>  So strode he back slow to the wounded King.</a>
<a id='line_10857'></a>
<a id='line_10858'>     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10859'>  'Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?</a>
<a id='line_10860'>  What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'</a>
<a id='line_10861'></a>
<a id='line_10862'>     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10863'>  'I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,</a>
<a id='line_10864'>  And the wild water lapping on the crag.'</a>
<a id='line_10865'></a>
<a id='line_10866'>     To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:</a>
<a id='line_10867'>  'Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,</a>
<a id='line_10868'>  Not rendering true answer, as beseemed</a>
<a id='line_10869'>  Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:</a>
<a id='line_10870'>  For surer sign had followed, either hand,</a>
<a id='line_10871'>  Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.</a>
<a id='line_10872'>  This is a shameful thing for men to lie.</a>
<a id='line_10873'>  Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,</a>
<a id='line_10874'>  As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing</a>
<a id='line_10875'>  I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.'</a>
<a id='line_10876'></a>
<a id='line_10877'>     Then went Sir Bedivere the second time</a>
<a id='line_10878'>  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,</a>
<a id='line_10879'>  Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;</a>
<a id='line_10880'>  But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,</a>
<a id='line_10881'>  How curiously and strangely chased, he smote</a>
<a id='line_10882'>  His palms together, and he cried aloud:</a>
<a id='line_10883'></a>
<a id='line_10884'>     'And if indeed I cast the brand away,</a>
<a id='line_10885'>  Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,</a>
<a id='line_10886'>  Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,</a>
<a id='line_10887'>  Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.</a>
<a id='line_10888'>  What good should follow this, if this were done?</a>
<a id='line_10889'>  What harm, undone?  Deep harm to disobey,</a>
<a id='line_10890'>  Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.</a>
<a id='line_10891'>  Were it well to obey then, if a king demand</a>
<a id='line_10892'>  An act unprofitable, against himself?</a>
<a id='line_10893'>  The King is sick, and knows not what he does.</a>
<a id='line_10894'>  What record, or what relic of my lord</a>
<a id='line_10895'>  Should be to aftertime, but empty breath</a>
<a id='line_10896'>  And rumours of a doubt?  But were this kept,</a>
<a id='line_10897'>  Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,</a>
<a id='line_10898'>  Some one might show it at a joust of arms,</a>
<a id='line_10899'>  Saying, "King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_10900'>  Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.</a>
<a id='line_10901'>  Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps</a>
<a id='line_10902'>  Upon the hidden bases of the hills."</a>
<a id='line_10903'>  So might some old man speak in the aftertime</a>
<a id='line_10904'>  To all the people, winning reverence.</a>
<a id='line_10905'>  But now much honour and much fame were lost.'</a>
<a id='line_10906'></a>
<a id='line_10907'>     So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,</a>
<a id='line_10908'>  And hid Excalibur the second time,</a>
<a id='line_10909'>  And so strode back slow to the wounded King.</a>
<a id='line_10910'></a>
<a id='line_10911'>     Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:</a>
<a id='line_10912'>  'What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'</a>
<a id='line_10913'></a>
<a id='line_10914'>     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10915'>  'I heard the water lapping on the crag,</a>
<a id='line_10916'>  And the long ripple washing in the reeds.'</a>
<a id='line_10917'></a>
<a id='line_10918'>     To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:</a>
<a id='line_10919'>  'Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,</a>
<a id='line_10920'>  Unknightly, traitor-hearted!  Woe is me!</a>
<a id='line_10921'>  Authority forgets a dying king,</a>
<a id='line_10922'>  Laid widowed of the power in his eye</a>
<a id='line_10923'>  That bowed the will.  I see thee what thou art,</a>
<a id='line_10924'>  For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,</a>
<a id='line_10925'>  In whom should meet the offices of all,</a>
<a id='line_10926'>  Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;</a>
<a id='line_10927'>  Either from lust of gold, or like a girl</a>
<a id='line_10928'>  Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.</a>
<a id='line_10929'>  Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,</a>
<a id='line_10930'>  And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:</a>
<a id='line_10931'>  But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,</a>
<a id='line_10932'>  I will arise and slay thee with my hands.'</a>
<a id='line_10933'></a>
<a id='line_10934'>     Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,</a>
<a id='line_10935'>  And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged</a>
<a id='line_10936'>  Among the bulrush beds, and clutched the sword,</a>
<a id='line_10937'>  And strongly wheeled and threw it.  The great brand</a>
<a id='line_10938'>  Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,</a>
<a id='line_10939'>  And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,</a>
<a id='line_10940'>  Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,</a>
<a id='line_10941'>  Seen where the moving isles of winter shock</a>
<a id='line_10942'>  By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.</a>
<a id='line_10943'>  So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:</a>
<a id='line_10944'>  But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm</a>
<a id='line_10945'>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</a>
<a id='line_10946'>  And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him</a>
<a id='line_10947'>  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.</a>
<a id='line_10948'>  And lightly went the other to the King.</a>
<a id='line_10949'></a>
<a id='line_10950'>     Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:</a>
<a id='line_10951'>  'Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.</a>
<a id='line_10952'>  Speak out:  what is it thou hast heard, or seen?'</a>
<a id='line_10953'></a>
<a id='line_10954'>     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_10955'>  'Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems</a>
<a id='line_10956'>  Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,</a>
<a id='line_10957'>  Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,</a>
<a id='line_10958'>  Not though I live three lives of mortal men,</a>
<a id='line_10959'>  So great a miracle as yonder hilt.</a>
<a id='line_10960'>  Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;</a>
<a id='line_10961'>  But when I looked again, behold an arm,</a>
<a id='line_10962'>  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</a>
<a id='line_10963'>  That caught him by the hilt, and brandished him</a>
<a id='line_10964'>  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.'</a>
<a id='line_10965'></a>
<a id='line_10966'>     And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:</a>
<a id='line_10967'>  'My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.</a>
<a id='line_10968'>  Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,</a>
<a id='line_10969'>  And bear me to the margin; yet I fear</a>
<a id='line_10970'>  My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.'</a>
<a id='line_10971'></a>
<a id='line_10972'>     So saying, from the pavement he half rose,</a>
<a id='line_10973'>  Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,</a>
<a id='line_10974'>  And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes</a>
<a id='line_10975'>  As in a picture.  Him Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_10976'>  Remorsefully regarded through his tears,</a>
<a id='line_10977'>  And would have spoken, but he found not words;</a>
<a id='line_10978'>  Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,</a>
<a id='line_10979'>  O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,</a>
<a id='line_10980'>  And rising bore him through the place of tombs.</a>
<a id='line_10981'></a>
<a id='line_10982'>     But, as he walked, King Arthur panted hard,</a>
<a id='line_10983'>  Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed</a>
<a id='line_10984'>  When all the house is mute.  So sighed the King,</a>
<a id='line_10985'>  Muttering and murmuring at his ear, 'Quick, quick!</a>
<a id='line_10986'>  I fear it is too late, and I shall die.'</a>
<a id='line_10987'></a>
<a id='line_10988'>     But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,</a>
<a id='line_10989'>  Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walked,</a>
<a id='line_10990'>  Larger than human on the frozen hills.</a>
<a id='line_10991'>  He heard the deep behind him, and a cry</a>
<a id='line_10992'>  Before.  His own thought drove him like a goad.</a>
<a id='line_10993'>  Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves</a>
<a id='line_10994'>  And barren chasms, and all to left and right</a>
<a id='line_10995'>  The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based</a>
<a id='line_10996'>  His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang</a>
<a id='line_10997'>  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--</a>
<a id='line_10998'>  And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,</a>
<a id='line_10999'>  And the long glories of the winter moon.</a>
<a id='line_11000'></a>
<a id='line_11001'>     Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,</a>
<a id='line_11002'>  Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,</a>
<a id='line_11003'>  Beneath them; and descending they were ware</a>
<a id='line_11004'>  That all the decks were dense with stately forms,</a>
<a id='line_11005'>  Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these</a>
<a id='line_11006'>  Three Queens with crowns of gold:  and from them rose</a>
<a id='line_11007'>  A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,</a>
<a id='line_11008'>  And, as it were one voice, an agony</a>
<a id='line_11009'>  Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills</a>
<a id='line_11010'>  All night in a waste land, where no one comes,</a>
<a id='line_11011'>  Or hath come, since the making of the world.</a>
<a id='line_11012'></a>
<a id='line_11013'>     Then murmured Arthur, 'Place me in the barge.'</a>
<a id='line_11014'>  So to the barge they came.  There those three Queens</a>
<a id='line_11015'>  Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.</a>
<a id='line_11016'>  But she, that rose the tallest of them all</a>
<a id='line_11017'>  And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,</a>
<a id='line_11018'>  And loosed the shattered casque, and chafed his hands,</a>
<a id='line_11019'>  And called him by his name, complaining loud,</a>
<a id='line_11020'>  And dropping bitter tears against a brow</a>
<a id='line_11021'>  Striped with dark blood:  for all his face was white</a>
<a id='line_11022'>  And colourless, and like the withered moon</a>
<a id='line_11023'>  Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;</a>
<a id='line_11024'>  And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops</a>
<a id='line_11025'>  Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--</a>
<a id='line_11026'>  That made his forehead like a rising sun</a>
<a id='line_11027'>  High from the dais-throne--were parched with dust;</a>
<a id='line_11028'>  Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,</a>
<a id='line_11029'>  Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.</a>
<a id='line_11030'>  So like a shattered column lay the King;</a>
<a id='line_11031'>  Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,</a>
<a id='line_11032'>  From spur to plume a star of tournament,</a>
<a id='line_11033'>  Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged</a>
<a id='line_11034'>  Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.</a>
<a id='line_11035'></a>
<a id='line_11036'>     Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:</a>
<a id='line_11037'>  'Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?</a>
<a id='line_11038'>  Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?</a>
<a id='line_11039'>  For now I see the true old times are dead,</a>
<a id='line_11040'>  When every morning brought a noble chance,</a>
<a id='line_11041'>  And every chance brought out a noble knight.</a>
<a id='line_11042'>  Such times have been not since the light that led</a>
<a id='line_11043'>  The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.</a>
<a id='line_11044'>  But now the whole Round Table is dissolved</a>
<a id='line_11045'>  Which was an image of the mighty world,</a>
<a id='line_11046'>  And I, the last, go forth companionless,</a>
<a id='line_11047'>  And the days darken round me, and the years,</a>
<a id='line_11048'>  Among new men, strange faces, other minds.'</a>
<a id='line_11049'></a>
<a id='line_11050'>     And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:</a>
<a id='line_11051'>  'The old order changeth, yielding place to new,</a>
<a id='line_11052'>  And God fulfils himself in many ways,</a>
<a id='line_11053'>  Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.</a>
<a id='line_11054'>  Comfort thyself:  what comfort is in me?</a>
<a id='line_11055'>  I have lived my life, and that which I have done</a>
<a id='line_11056'>  May He within himself make pure! but thou,</a>
<a id='line_11057'>  If thou shouldst never see my face again,</a>
<a id='line_11058'>  Pray for my soul.  More things are wrought by prayer</a>
<a id='line_11059'>  Than this world dreams of.  Wherefore, let thy voice</a>
<a id='line_11060'>  Rise like a fountain for me night and day.</a>
<a id='line_11061'>  For what are men better than sheep or goats</a>
<a id='line_11062'>  That nourish a blind life within the brain,</a>
<a id='line_11063'>  If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer</a>
<a id='line_11064'>  Both for themselves and those who call them friend?</a>
<a id='line_11065'>  For so the whole round earth is every way</a>
<a id='line_11066'>  Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.</a>
<a id='line_11067'>  But now farewell.  I am going a long way</a>
<a id='line_11068'>  With these thou seest--if indeed I go</a>
<a id='line_11069'>  (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--</a>
<a id='line_11070'>  To the island-valley of Avilion;</a>
<a id='line_11071'>  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,</a>
<a id='line_11072'>  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies</a>
<a id='line_11073'>  Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns</a>
<a id='line_11074'>  And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea,</a>
<a id='line_11075'>  Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.'</a>
<a id='line_11076'></a>
<a id='line_11077'>     So said he, and the barge with oar and sail</a>
<a id='line_11078'>  Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan</a>
<a id='line_11079'>  That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,</a>
<a id='line_11080'>  Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood</a>
<a id='line_11081'>  With swarthy webs.  Long stood Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_11082'>  Revolving many memories, till the hull</a>
<a id='line_11083'>  Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,</a>
<a id='line_11084'>  And on the mere the wailing died away.</a>
<a id='line_11085'></a>
<a id='line_11086'>     But when that moan had past for evermore,</a>
<a id='line_11087'>  The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn</a>
<a id='line_11088'>  Amazed him, and he groaned, 'The King is gone.'</a>
<a id='line_11089'>  And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,</a>
<a id='line_11090'>  'From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'</a>
<a id='line_11091'></a>
<a id='line_11092'>     Whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb</a>
<a id='line_11093'>  The last hard footstep of that iron crag;</a>
<a id='line_11094'>  Thence marked the black hull moving yet, and cried,</a>
<a id='line_11095'>  'He passes to be King among the dead,</a>
<a id='line_11096'>  And after healing of his grievous wound</a>
<a id='line_11097'>  He comes again; but--if he come no more--</a>
<a id='line_11098'>  O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,</a>
<a id='line_11099'>  Who shrieked and wailed, the three whereat we gazed</a>
<a id='line_11100'>  On that high day, when, clothed with living light,</a>
<a id='line_11101'>  They stood before his throne in silence, friends</a>
<a id='line_11102'>  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?'</a>
<a id='line_11103'></a>
<a id='line_11104'>     Then from the dawn it seemed there came, but faint</a>
<a id='line_11105'>  As from beyond the limit of the world,</a>
<a id='line_11106'>  Like the last echo born of a great cry,</a>
<a id='line_11107'>  Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice</a>
<a id='line_11108'>  Around a king returning from his wars.</a>
<a id='line_11109'></a>
<a id='line_11110'>     Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb</a>
<a id='line_11111'>  Even to the highest he could climb, and saw,</a>
<a id='line_11112'>  Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,</a>
<a id='line_11113'>  Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,</a>
<a id='line_11114'>  Down that long water opening on the deep</a>
<a id='line_11115'>  Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go</a>
<a id='line_11116'>  From less to less and vanish into light.</a>
<a id='line_11117'>  And the new sun rose bringing the new year.</a>
<a id='line_11118'></a>
<a id='line_11119'></a>
<a id='line_11120'></a>
<a id='line_11121'>  To the Queen</a>
<a id='line_11122'></a>
<a id='line_11123'>  O loyal to the royal in thyself,</a>
<a id='line_11124'>  And loyal to thy land, as this to thee--</a>
<a id='line_11125'>  Bear witness, that rememberable day,</a>
<a id='line_11126'>  When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince</a>
<a id='line_11127'>  Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again</a>
<a id='line_11128'>  From halfway down the shadow of the grave,</a>
<a id='line_11129'>  Past with thee through thy people and their love,</a>
<a id='line_11130'>  And London rolled one tide of joy through all</a>
<a id='line_11131'>  Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man</a>
<a id='line_11132'>  And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry,</a>
<a id='line_11133'>  The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime--</a>
<a id='line_11134'>  Thunderless lightnings striking under sea</a>
<a id='line_11135'>  From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm,</a>
<a id='line_11136'>  And that true North, whereof we lately heard</a>
<a id='line_11137'>  A strain to shame us 'keep you to yourselves;</a>
<a id='line_11138'>  So loyal is too costly! friends--your love</a>
<a id='line_11139'>  Is but a burthen:  loose the bond, and go.'</a>
<a id='line_11140'>  Is this the tone of empire? here the faith</a>
<a id='line_11141'>  That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice</a>
<a id='line_11142'>  And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont</a>
<a id='line_11143'>  Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven?</a>
<a id='line_11144'>  What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak</a>
<a id='line_11145'>  So feebly? wealthier--wealthier--hour by hour!</a>
<a id='line_11146'>  The voice of Britain, or a sinking land,</a>
<a id='line_11147'>  Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas?</a>
<a id='line_11148'>  There rang her voice, when the full city pealed</a>
<a id='line_11149'>  Thee and thy Prince!  The loyal to their crown</a>
<a id='line_11150'>  Are loyal to their own far sons, who love</a>
<a id='line_11151'>  Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes</a>
<a id='line_11152'>  For ever-broadening England, and her throne</a>
<a id='line_11153'>  In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,</a>
<a id='line_11154'>  That knows not her own greatness:  if she knows</a>
<a id='line_11155'>  And dreads it we are fallen. --But thou, my Queen,</a>
<a id='line_11156'>  Not for itself, but through thy living love</a>
<a id='line_11157'>  For one to whom I made it o'er his grave</a>
<a id='line_11158'>  Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale,</a>
<a id='line_11159'>  New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul,</a>
<a id='line_11160'>  Ideal manhood closed in real man,</a>
<a id='line_11161'>  Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost,</a>
<a id='line_11162'>  Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,</a>
<a id='line_11163'>  And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him</a>
<a id='line_11164'>  Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's, one</a>
<a id='line_11165'>  Touched by the adulterous finger of a time</a>
<a id='line_11166'>  That hovered between war and wantonness,</a>
<a id='line_11167'>  And crownings and dethronements:  take withal</a>
<a id='line_11168'>  Thy poet's blessing, and his trust that Heaven</a>
<a id='line_11169'>  Will blow the tempest in the distance back</a>
<a id='line_11170'>  From thine and ours:  for some are scared, who mark,</a>
<a id='line_11171'>  Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm,</a>
<a id='line_11172'>  Waverings of every vane with every wind,</a>
<a id='line_11173'>  And wordy trucklings to the transient hour,</a>
<a id='line_11174'>  And fierce or careless looseners of the faith,</a>
<a id='line_11175'>  And Softness breeding scorn of simple life,</a>
<a id='line_11176'>  Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold,</a>
<a id='line_11177'>  Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice,</a>
<a id='line_11178'>  Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France,</a>
<a id='line_11179'>  And that which knows, but careful for itself,</a>
<a id='line_11180'>  And that which knows not, ruling that which knows</a>
<a id='line_11181'>  To its own harm:  the goal of this great world</a>
<a id='line_11182'>  Lies beyond sight:  yet--if our slowly-grown</a>
<a id='line_11183'>  And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense,</a>
<a id='line_11184'>  That saved her many times, not fail--their fears</a>
<a id='line_11185'>  Are morning shadows huger than the shapes</a>
<a id='line_11186'>  That cast them, not those gloomier which forego</a>
<a id='line_11187'>  The darkness of that battle in the West,</a>
<a id='line_11188'>  Where all of high and holy dies away.</a>
