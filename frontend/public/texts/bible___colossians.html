                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,</a>
<a id='line_4'>and Timotheus our brother, 1:2  To the saints and faithful brethren</a>
<a id='line_5'>in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace,</a>
<a id='line_6'>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying</a>
<a id='line_9'>always for you,</a>
<a id='line_10'>1:4  Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye</a>
<a id='line_11'>have to all the saints,</a>
<a id='line_12'>1:5  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard</a>
<a id='line_13'>before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</a>
<a id='line_14'>1:6  Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth</a>
<a id='line_15'>fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the</a>
<a id='line_16'>grace of God in truth:</a>
<a id='line_17'>1:7  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you</a>
<a id='line_18'>a faithful minister of Christ;</a>
<a id='line_19'>1:8  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:9  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to</a>
<a id='line_22'>pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his</a>
<a id='line_23'>will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</a>
<a id='line_24'>1:10  That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being</a>
<a id='line_25'>fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</a>
<a id='line_26'>1:11  Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto</a>
<a id='line_27'>all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</a>
<a id='line_28'>1:12  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be</a>
<a id='line_29'>partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</a>
<a id='line_30'>1:13  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated</a>
<a id='line_31'>us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</a>
<a id='line_32'>1:14  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of</a>
<a id='line_33'>sins:</a>
<a id='line_34'>1:15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every</a>
<a id='line_35'>creature:</a>
<a id='line_36'>1:16  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are</a>
<a id='line_37'>in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or</a>
<a id='line_38'>principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</a>
<a id='line_39'>1:17  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:18  And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the</a>
<a id='line_42'>firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:19  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;</a>
<a id='line_45'>1:20  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to</a>
<a id='line_46'>reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in</a>
<a id='line_47'>earth, or things in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_48'></a>
<a id='line_49'>1:21  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by</a>
<a id='line_50'>wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled</a>
<a id='line_51'>1:22  In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and</a>
<a id='line_52'>unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</a>
<a id='line_53'>1:23  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved</a>
<a id='line_54'>away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached</a>
<a id='line_55'>to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</a>
<a id='line_56'>1:24  Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is</a>
<a id='line_57'>behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodyâ€™s sake, which is</a>
<a id='line_58'>the church:</a>
<a id='line_59'>1:25  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God</a>
<a id='line_60'>which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</a>
<a id='line_61'>1:26  Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,</a>
<a id='line_62'>but now is made manifest to his saints:</a>
<a id='line_63'>1:27  To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this</a>
<a id='line_64'>mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</a>
<a id='line_65'>1:28  Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all</a>
<a id='line_66'>wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</a>
<a id='line_67'>1:29  Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which</a>
<a id='line_68'>worketh in me mightily.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>2:1  For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for</a>
<a id='line_71'>them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</a>
<a id='line_72'>2:2  That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and</a>
<a id='line_73'>unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the</a>
<a id='line_74'>acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</a>
<a id='line_75'>2:3  In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>2:4  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:5  For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,</a>
<a id='line_80'>joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in</a>
<a id='line_81'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:6  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in</a>
<a id='line_84'>him:</a>
<a id='line_85'>2:7  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have</a>
<a id='line_86'>been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,</a>
<a id='line_89'>after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after</a>
<a id='line_90'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and</a>
<a id='line_95'>power:</a>
<a id='line_96'>2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without</a>
<a id='line_97'>hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision</a>
<a id='line_98'>of Christ:</a>
<a id='line_99'>2:12  Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him</a>
<a id='line_100'>through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your</a>
<a id='line_103'>flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all</a>
<a id='line_104'>trespasses;</a>
<a id='line_105'>2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which</a>
<a id='line_106'>was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</a>
<a id='line_107'>2:15  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them</a>
<a id='line_108'>openly, triumphing over them in it.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:16  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of</a>
<a id='line_111'>an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:</a>
<a id='line_112'>2:17  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:18  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and</a>
<a id='line_115'>worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen,</a>
<a id='line_116'>vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</a>
<a id='line_117'>2:19  And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands</a>
<a id='line_118'>having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the</a>
<a id='line_119'>increase of God.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:20  Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,</a>
<a id='line_122'>why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</a>
<a id='line_123'>2:21  (Touch not; taste not; handle not;</a>
<a id='line_124'>2:22  Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and</a>
<a id='line_125'>doctrines of men?</a>
<a id='line_126'>2:23  Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and</a>
<a id='line_127'>humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying</a>
<a id='line_128'>of the flesh.</a>
<a id='line_129'></a>
<a id='line_130'>3:1  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,</a>
<a id='line_131'>where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>3:2  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>3:4  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear</a>
<a id='line_138'>with him in glory.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>3:5  Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,</a>
<a id='line_141'>uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,</a>
<a id='line_142'>which is idolatry:</a>
<a id='line_143'>3:6  For which thingsâ€™ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of</a>
<a id='line_144'>disobedience:</a>
<a id='line_145'>3:7  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>3:8  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,</a>
<a id='line_148'>filthy communication out of your mouth.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>3:9  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with</a>
<a id='line_151'>his deeds;</a>
<a id='line_152'>3:10  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the</a>
<a id='line_153'>image of him that created him:</a>
<a id='line_154'>3:11  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor</a>
<a id='line_155'>uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in</a>
<a id='line_156'>all.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>3:12  Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of</a>
<a id='line_159'>mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</a>
<a id='line_160'>3:13  Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a</a>
<a id='line_161'>quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:14  And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of</a>
<a id='line_164'>perfectness.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>3:15  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye</a>
<a id='line_167'>are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>3:16  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching</a>
<a id='line_170'>and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing</a>
<a id='line_171'>with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>3:17  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord</a>
<a id='line_174'>Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>3:18  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the</a>
<a id='line_177'>Lord.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>3:19  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:20  Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing</a>
<a id='line_182'>unto the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>3:21  Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be</a>
<a id='line_185'>discouraged.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>3:22  Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not</a>
<a id='line_188'>with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;</a>
<a id='line_189'>3:23  And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto</a>
<a id='line_190'>men;</a>
<a id='line_191'>3:24  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the</a>
<a id='line_192'>inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>3:25  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath</a>
<a id='line_195'>done: and there is no respect of persons.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>4:1  Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing</a>
<a id='line_198'>that ye also have a Master in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>4:2  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</a>
<a id='line_201'>4:3  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of</a>
<a id='line_202'>utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</a>
<a id='line_203'>4:4  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>4:5  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>4:6  Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may</a>
<a id='line_208'>know how ye ought to answer every man.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>4:7  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved</a>
<a id='line_211'>brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:</a>
<a id='line_212'>4:8  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know</a>
<a id='line_213'>your estate, and comfort your hearts;</a>
<a id='line_214'>4:9  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They</a>
<a id='line_215'>shall make known unto you all things which are done here.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>4:10  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sisterâ€™s son</a>
<a id='line_218'>to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you,</a>
<a id='line_219'>receive him;)</a>
<a id='line_220'>4:11  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These</a>
<a id='line_221'>only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort</a>
<a id='line_222'>unto me.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:12  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,</a>
<a id='line_225'>always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and</a>
<a id='line_226'>complete in all the will of God.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>4:13  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them</a>
<a id='line_229'>that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>4:14  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>4:15  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the</a>
<a id='line_234'>church which is in his house.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>4:16  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also</a>
<a id='line_237'>in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from</a>
<a id='line_238'>Laodicea.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>4:17  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_241'>received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>4:18  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be</a>
<a id='line_244'>with you. Amen.</a>
