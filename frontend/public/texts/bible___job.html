                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of Job</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that</a>
<a id='line_4'>man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand</a>
<a id='line_9'>camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and</a>
<a id='line_10'>a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the</a>
<a id='line_11'>men of the east.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;</a>
<a id='line_14'>and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with</a>
<a id='line_15'>them.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,</a>
<a id='line_18'>that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,</a>
<a id='line_19'>and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for</a>
<a id='line_20'>Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their</a>
<a id='line_21'>hearts. Thus did Job continually.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present</a>
<a id='line_24'>themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan</a>
<a id='line_27'>answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_28'>from walking up and down in it.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,</a>
<a id='line_31'>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright</a>
<a id='line_32'>man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  1:9 Then Satan</a>
<a id='line_33'>answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  1:10 Hast</a>
<a id='line_34'>not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all</a>
<a id='line_35'>that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands,</a>
<a id='line_36'>and his substance is increased in the land.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he</a>
<a id='line_39'>will curse thee to thy face.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy</a>
<a id='line_42'>power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth</a>
<a id='line_43'>from the presence of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating</a>
<a id='line_46'>and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 1:14 And there came</a>
<a id='line_47'>a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses</a>
<a id='line_48'>feeding beside them: 1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took</a>
<a id='line_49'>them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_50'>sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The</a>
<a id='line_53'>fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and</a>
<a id='line_54'>the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell</a>
<a id='line_55'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The</a>
<a id='line_58'>Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have</a>
<a id='line_59'>carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the</a>
<a id='line_60'>sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy</a>
<a id='line_63'>sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest</a>
<a id='line_64'>brother’s house: 1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the</a>
<a id='line_65'>wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon</a>
<a id='line_66'>the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell</a>
<a id='line_67'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and</a>
<a id='line_70'>fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 1:21 And said, Naked came I</a>
<a id='line_71'>out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD</a>
<a id='line_72'>gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present</a>
<a id='line_77'>themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present</a>
<a id='line_78'>himself before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan</a>
<a id='line_81'>answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_82'>from walking up and down in it.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,</a>
<a id='line_85'>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright</a>
<a id='line_86'>man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth</a>
<a id='line_87'>fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy</a>
<a id='line_88'>him without cause.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all</a>
<a id='line_91'>that a man hath will he give for his life.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>2:5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,</a>
<a id='line_94'>and he will curse thee to thy face.</a>
<a id='line_95'></a>
<a id='line_96'>2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but</a>
<a id='line_97'>save his life.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job</a>
<a id='line_100'>with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat</a>
<a id='line_103'>down among the ashes.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>2:9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine</a>
<a id='line_106'>integrity?  curse God, and die.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>2:10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women</a>
<a id='line_109'>speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we</a>
<a id='line_110'>not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>2:11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come</a>
<a id='line_113'>upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the</a>
<a id='line_114'>Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they</a>
<a id='line_115'>had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to</a>
<a id='line_116'>comfort him.</a>
<a id='line_117'></a>
<a id='line_118'>2:12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,</a>
<a id='line_119'>they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his</a>
<a id='line_120'>mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven</a>
<a id='line_123'>nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief</a>
<a id='line_124'>was very great.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>3:1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>3:2 And Job spake, and said, 3:3 Let the day perish wherein I was</a>
<a id='line_129'>born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child</a>
<a id='line_130'>conceived.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>3:4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,</a>
<a id='line_133'>neither let the light shine upon it.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell</a>
<a id='line_136'>upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>3:6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be</a>
<a id='line_139'>joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of</a>
<a id='line_140'>the months.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>3:7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>3:8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up</a>
<a id='line_145'>their mourning.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>3:9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for</a>
<a id='line_148'>light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 3:10</a>
<a id='line_149'>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow</a>
<a id='line_150'>from mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost</a>
<a id='line_153'>when I came out of the belly?  3:12 Why did the knees prevent me? or</a>
<a id='line_154'>why the breasts that I should suck?  3:13 For now should I have lain</a>
<a id='line_155'>still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</a>
<a id='line_156'>3:14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate</a>
<a id='line_157'>places for themselves; 3:15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled</a>
<a id='line_158'>their houses with silver: 3:16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had</a>
<a id='line_159'>not been; as infants which never saw light.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at</a>
<a id='line_162'>rest.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>3:18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_165'>oppressor.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his</a>
<a id='line_168'>master.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto</a>
<a id='line_171'>the bitter in soul; 3:21 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and</a>
<a id='line_172'>dig for it more than for hid treasures; 3:22 Which rejoice</a>
<a id='line_173'>exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?  3:23 Why is</a>
<a id='line_174'>light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</a>
<a id='line_175'>3:24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured</a>
<a id='line_176'>out like the waters.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>3:25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that</a>
<a id='line_179'>which I was afraid of is come unto me.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet</a>
<a id='line_182'>trouble came.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 4:2 If we assay to</a>
<a id='line_185'>commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself</a>
<a id='line_186'>from speaking?  4:3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast</a>
<a id='line_187'>strengthened the weak hands.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>4:4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast</a>
<a id='line_190'>strengthened the feeble knees.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>4:5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,</a>
<a id='line_193'>and thou art troubled.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>4:6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the</a>
<a id='line_196'>uprightness of thy ways?  4:7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever</a>
<a id='line_197'>perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?  4:8</a>
<a id='line_198'>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap</a>
<a id='line_199'>the same.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>4:9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils</a>
<a id='line_202'>are they consumed.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and</a>
<a id='line_205'>the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>4:11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s</a>
<a id='line_208'>whelps are scattered abroad.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>4:12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a</a>
<a id='line_211'>little thereof.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep</a>
<a id='line_214'>falleth on men, 4:14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all</a>
<a id='line_215'>my bones to shake.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>4:15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood</a>
<a id='line_218'>up: 4:16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an</a>
<a id='line_219'>image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice,</a>
<a id='line_220'>saying, 4:17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be</a>
<a id='line_221'>more pure than his maker?  4:18 Behold, he put no trust in his</a>
<a id='line_222'>servants; and his angels he charged with folly: 4:19 How much less in</a>
<a id='line_223'>them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust,</a>
<a id='line_224'>which are crushed before the moth?  4:20 They are destroyed from</a>
<a id='line_225'>morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,</a>
<a id='line_228'>even without wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>5:1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of</a>
<a id='line_231'>the saints wilt thou turn?  5:2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and</a>
<a id='line_232'>envy slayeth the silly one.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his</a>
<a id='line_235'>habitation.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>5:4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the</a>
<a id='line_238'>gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>5:5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the</a>
<a id='line_241'>thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>5:6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth</a>
<a id='line_244'>trouble spring out of the ground; 5:7 Yet man is born unto trouble, as</a>
<a id='line_245'>the sparks fly upward.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>5:8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 5:9</a>
<a id='line_248'>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without</a>
<a id='line_249'>number: 5:10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon</a>
<a id='line_250'>the fields: 5:11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which</a>
<a id='line_251'>mourn may be exalted to safety.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands</a>
<a id='line_254'>cannot perform their enterprise.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>5:13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of</a>
<a id='line_257'>the froward is carried headlong.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday</a>
<a id='line_260'>as in the night.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>5:15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from</a>
<a id='line_263'>the hand of the mighty.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>5:17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise</a>
<a id='line_268'>not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 5:18 For he maketh sore, and</a>
<a id='line_269'>bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>5:19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall</a>
<a id='line_272'>no evil touch thee.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>5:20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the</a>
<a id='line_275'>power of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>5:21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt</a>
<a id='line_278'>thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>5:22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be</a>
<a id='line_281'>afraid of the beasts of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>5:23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the</a>
<a id='line_284'>beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>5:24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and</a>
<a id='line_287'>thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>5:25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine</a>
<a id='line_290'>offspring as the grass of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>5:26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of</a>
<a id='line_293'>corn cometh in in his season.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it</a>
<a id='line_296'>for thy good.</a>
<a id='line_297'></a>
<a id='line_298'>6:1 But Job answered and said, 6:2 Oh that my grief were throughly</a>
<a id='line_299'>weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!  6:3 For now</a>
<a id='line_300'>it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are</a>
<a id='line_301'>swallowed up.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof</a>
<a id='line_304'>drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array</a>
<a id='line_305'>against me.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>6:5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over</a>
<a id='line_308'>his fodder?  6:6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or</a>
<a id='line_309'>is there any taste in the white of an egg?  6:7 The things that my</a>
<a id='line_310'>soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>6:8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the</a>
<a id='line_313'>thing that I long for!  6:9 Even that it would please God to destroy</a>
<a id='line_314'>me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!  6:10 Then</a>
<a id='line_315'>should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let</a>
<a id='line_316'>him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>6:11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,</a>
<a id='line_319'>that I should prolong my life?  6:12 Is my strength the strength of</a>

<a id='line_321'>wisdom driven quite from me?  6:14 To him that is afflicted pity</a>

<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>6:20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither,</a>

<a id='line_343'>from the hand of the mighty?  6:24 Teach me, and I will hold my</a>

<a id='line_364'>7:4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?</a>

<a id='line_384'>7:11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the</a>

<a id='line_391'>rather than my life.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days</a>

<a id='line_399'>thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my</a>
<a id='line_400'>spittle?  7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou</a>
<a id='line_401'>preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so</a>
<a id='line_402'>that I am a burden to myself?  7:21 And why dost thou not pardon my</a>
<a id='line_403'>transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the</a>
<a id='line_404'>dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou</a>

<a id='line_409'>pervert justice?  8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he</a>
<a id='line_410'>have cast them away for their transgression; 8:5 If thou wouldest seek</a>
<a id='line_411'>unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 8:6 If</a>
<a id='line_412'>thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and</a>
<a id='line_413'>make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly</a>
<a id='line_416'>increase.</a>

<a id='line_418'>8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself</a>
<a id='line_419'>to the search of their fathers: 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and</a>

<a id='line_421'>not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their</a>
<a id='line_422'>heart?  8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow</a>
<a id='line_423'>without water?  8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut</a>

<a id='line_426'>8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope</a>

<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall</a>
<a id='line_431'>hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</a>
<a id='line_432'></a>

<a id='line_434'>garden.</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of</a>
<a id='line_437'>stones.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_440'>I have not seen thee.</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall</a>

<a id='line_444'></a>
<a id='line_445'>8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he</a>

<a id='line_448'></a>
<a id='line_449'>8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling</a>

<a id='line_452'>9:1 Then Job answered and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but</a>
<a id='line_453'>how should man be just with God?  9:3 If he will contend with him, he</a>
<a id='line_454'>cannot answer him one of a thousand.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened</a>
<a id='line_457'>himself against him, and hath prospered?  9:5 Which removeth the</a>
<a id='line_458'>mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof</a>
<a id='line_461'>tremble.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the</a>
<a id='line_464'>stars.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves</a>
<a id='line_467'>of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of</a>
<a id='line_470'>the south.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders</a>
<a id='line_473'>without number.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I</a>
<a id='line_476'>perceive him not.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto</a>
<a id='line_479'>him, What doest thou?  9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the</a>
<a id='line_480'>proud helpers do stoop under him.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to</a>
<a id='line_483'>reason with him?  9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not</a>
<a id='line_484'>answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</a>
<a id='line_485'></a>
<a id='line_486'>9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe</a>
<a id='line_487'>that he had hearkened unto my voice.</a>
<a id='line_488'></a>
<a id='line_489'>9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds</a>
<a id='line_490'>without cause.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with</a>
<a id='line_493'>bitterness.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who</a>
<a id='line_496'>shall set me a time to plead?  9:20 If I justify myself, mine own</a>
<a id='line_497'>mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me</a>
<a id='line_498'>perverse.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would</a>
<a id='line_501'>despise my life.</a>
<a id='line_502'></a>
<a id='line_503'>9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect</a>
<a id='line_504'>and the wicked.</a>
<a id='line_505'></a>
<a id='line_506'>9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the</a>
<a id='line_507'>innocent.</a>
<a id='line_508'></a>
<a id='line_509'>9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the</a>
<a id='line_510'>faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?  9:25 Now</a>
<a id='line_511'>my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that</a>
<a id='line_514'>hasteth to the prey.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my</a>
<a id='line_517'>heaviness, and comfort myself: 9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I</a>
<a id='line_518'>know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?  9:30 If I wash myself</a>
<a id='line_521'>with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 9:31 Yet shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_522'>plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</a>
<a id='line_523'></a>
<a id='line_524'>9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we</a>
<a id='line_525'>should come together in judgment.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand</a>
<a id='line_528'>upon us both.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify</a>
<a id='line_531'>me: 9:35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with</a>
<a id='line_532'>me.</a>
<a id='line_533'></a>
<a id='line_534'>10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon</a>
<a id='line_535'>myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</a>
<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou</a>
<a id='line_538'>contendest with me.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou</a>
<a id='line_541'>shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel</a>
<a id='line_542'>of the wicked?  10:4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man</a>
<a id='line_543'>seeth?  10:5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man’s</a>
<a id='line_544'>days, 10:6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest</a>
<a id='line_545'>after my sin?  10:7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is</a>
<a id='line_546'>none that can deliver out of thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>10:8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;</a>
<a id='line_549'>yet thou dost destroy me.</a>
<a id='line_550'></a>
<a id='line_551'>10:9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and</a>
<a id='line_552'>wilt thou bring me into dust again?  10:10 Hast thou not poured me out</a>
<a id='line_553'>as milk, and curdled me like cheese?  10:11 Thou hast clothed me with</a>
<a id='line_554'>skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath</a>
<a id='line_557'>preserved my spirit.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>10:13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this</a>
<a id='line_560'>is with thee.</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from</a>
<a id='line_563'>mine iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I</a>
<a id='line_566'>not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine</a>
<a id='line_567'>affliction; 10:16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:</a>
<a id='line_568'>and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine</a>
<a id='line_571'>indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh</a>
<a id='line_574'>that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  10:19 I should</a>
<a id='line_575'>have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from</a>
<a id='line_576'>the womb to the grave.</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>10:20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may</a>
<a id='line_579'>take comfort a little, 10:21 Before I go whence I shall not return,</a>
<a id='line_580'>even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 10:22 A land of</a>
<a id='line_581'>darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any</a>
<a id='line_582'>order, and where the light is as darkness.</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>11:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2 Should not</a>
<a id='line_585'>the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be</a>
<a id='line_586'>justified?  11:3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when</a>
<a id='line_587'>thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?  11:4 For thou hast</a>
<a id='line_588'>said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 11:6</a>
<a id='line_591'>And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are</a>
<a id='line_592'>double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less</a>
<a id='line_593'>than thine iniquity deserveth.</a>
<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>11:7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the</a>
<a id='line_596'>Almighty unto perfection?  11:8 It is as high as heaven; what canst</a>

<a id='line_598'>thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>11:10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can</a>
<a id='line_601'>hinder him?  11:11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also;</a>
<a id='line_602'>will he not then consider it?  11:12 For vain men would be wise,</a>
<a id='line_603'>though man be born like a wild ass’s colt.</a>
<a id='line_604'></a>
<a id='line_605'>11:13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward</a>
<a id='line_606'>him; 11:14 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not</a>
<a id='line_607'>wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>11:15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou</a>
<a id='line_610'>shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 11:16 Because thou shalt forget</a>
<a id='line_611'>thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: 11:17 And thine</a>
<a id='line_612'>age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou</a>
<a id='line_613'>shalt be as the morning.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>11:18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_616'>dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>11:19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea,</a>
<a id='line_619'>many shall make suit unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_620'></a>
<a id='line_621'>11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not</a>

<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>12:1 And Job answered and said, 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people,</a>

<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly</a>

<a id='line_753'>13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth</a>

<a id='line_773'>14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock</a>

<a id='line_785'>a set time, and remember me!  14:14 If a man die, shall he live again?</a>
<a id='line_786'>all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire</a>

<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>14:16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my</a>
<a id='line_792'>sin?  14:17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up</a>

<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>14:18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock</a>
<a id='line_796'>is removed out of his place.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>14:19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which</a>

<a id='line_800'>man.</a>
<a id='line_801'></a>
<a id='line_802'>14:20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou</a>

<a id='line_804'></a>
<a id='line_805'>14:21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are</a>
<a id='line_806'>brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</a>
<a id='line_807'></a>
<a id='line_808'>14:22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him</a>
<a id='line_809'>shall mourn.</a>

<a id='line_811'>15:1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 15:2 Should a wise</a>

<a id='line_813'>Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he</a>

<a id='line_815'>prayer before God.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>15:5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the</a>

<a id='line_826'>what understandest thou, which is not in us?  15:10 With us are both</a>

<a id='line_829'>15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret</a>
<a id='line_830'>thing with thee?  15:12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what</a>
<a id='line_831'>do thy eyes wink at, 15:13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God,</a>
<a id='line_832'>and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?  15:14 What is man, that</a>
<a id='line_833'>he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be</a>
<a id='line_834'>righteous?  15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the</a>
<a id='line_835'>heavens are not clean in his sight.</a>
<a id='line_836'></a>
<a id='line_837'>15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh</a>
<a id='line_838'>iniquity like water?  15:17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which</a>
<a id='line_839'>I have seen I will declare; 15:18 Which wise men have told from their</a>
<a id='line_840'>fathers, and have not hid it: 15:19 Unto whom alone the earth was</a>
<a id='line_841'>given, and no stranger passed among them.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number</a>
<a id='line_844'>of years is hidden to the oppressor.</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'>15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer</a>
<a id='line_847'>shall come upon him.</a>
<a id='line_848'></a>
<a id='line_849'>15:22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is</a>
<a id='line_850'>waited for of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>15:23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth</a>
<a id='line_853'>that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>15:24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail</a>
<a id='line_856'>against him, as a king ready to the battle.</a>
<a id='line_857'></a>
<a id='line_858'>15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth</a>
<a id='line_859'>himself against the Almighty.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of</a>
<a id='line_862'>his bucklers: 15:27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and</a>
<a id='line_863'>maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</a>
<a id='line_864'></a>
<a id='line_865'>15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man</a>
<a id='line_866'>inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</a>
<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>15:29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,</a>
<a id='line_869'>neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_870'></a>
<a id='line_871'>15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his</a>
<a id='line_872'>branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</a>
<a id='line_873'></a>
<a id='line_874'>15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall</a>
<a id='line_875'>be his recompence.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall</a>
<a id='line_878'>not be green.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast</a>
<a id='line_881'>off his flower as the olive.</a>
<a id='line_882'></a>
<a id='line_883'>15:34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire</a>
<a id='line_884'>shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</a>
<a id='line_885'></a>
<a id='line_886'>15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly</a>
<a id='line_887'>prepareth deceit.</a>
<a id='line_888'></a>
<a id='line_889'>16:1 Then Job answered and said, 16:2 I have heard many such things:</a>
<a id='line_890'>miserable comforters are ye all.</a>
<a id='line_891'></a>
<a id='line_892'>16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou</a>
<a id='line_893'>answerest?  16:4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my</a>
<a id='line_894'>soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head</a>
<a id='line_895'>at you.</a>
<a id='line_896'></a>
<a id='line_897'>16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my</a>
<a id='line_898'>lips should asswage your grief.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,</a>
<a id='line_901'>what am I eased?  16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made</a>
<a id='line_902'>desolate all my company.</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against</a>
<a id='line_905'>me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</a>
<a id='line_906'></a>
<a id='line_907'>16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me</a>
<a id='line_908'>with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</a>
<a id='line_909'></a>
<a id='line_910'>16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me</a>
<a id='line_911'>upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together</a>
<a id='line_912'>against me.</a>
<a id='line_913'></a>
<a id='line_914'>16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into</a>
<a id='line_915'>the hands of the wicked.</a>
<a id='line_916'></a>
<a id='line_917'>16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken</a>
<a id='line_918'>me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins</a>
<a id='line_921'>asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_922'></a>
<a id='line_923'>16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like</a>
<a id='line_924'>a giant.</a>
<a id='line_925'></a>
<a id='line_926'>16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the</a>

<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of</a>

<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on</a>

<a id='line_940'>16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for</a>
<a id='line_941'>his neighbour!  16:22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the</a>
<a id='line_942'>way whence I shall not return.</a>
<a id='line_943'></a>
<a id='line_944'>17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready</a>

<a id='line_946'></a>
<a id='line_947'>17:2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in</a>

<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>17:5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his</a>
<a id='line_953'>children shall fail.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was</a>
<a id='line_956'>as a tabret.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are</a>

<a id='line_1103'>lead in the rock for ever!  19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth,</a>
<a id='line_1104'>and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 19:26 And</a>
<a id='line_1105'>though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I</a>
<a id='line_1106'>see God: 19:27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall</a>

<a id='line_1109'>19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the</a>

<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he</a>

<a id='line_1159'></a>
<a id='line_1160'>20:21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man</a>

<a id='line_1169'>20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall</a>

<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>20:27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise</a>

<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I</a>

<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a</a>

<a id='line_1649'></a>

<a id='line_1681'>30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose</a>

<a id='line_1684'>30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom</a>
<a id='line_1685'>old age was perished?  30:3 For want and famine they were solitary;</a>

<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their</a>

<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were</a>

<a id='line_1698'>30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were</a>

<a id='line_1705'></a>
<a id='line_1706'>30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also</a>

<a id='line_1712'>30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no</a>

<a id='line_1721'>30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction</a>

<a id='line_1727'>30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it</a>
<a id='line_1728'>bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</a>
<a id='line_1729'></a>
<a id='line_1730'>30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and</a>
<a id='line_1731'>ashes.</a>
<a id='line_1732'></a>
<a id='line_1733'>30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou</a>

<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest</a>

<a id='line_1738'></a>
<a id='line_1739'>30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,</a>

<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house</a>

<a id='line_1744'></a>
<a id='line_1745'>30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though</a>

<a id='line_1747'></a>
<a id='line_1748'>30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul</a>
<a id='line_1749'>grieved for the poor?  30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came</a>
<a id='line_1750'>unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</a>
<a id='line_1751'></a>
<a id='line_1752'>30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction</a>
<a id='line_1753'>prevented me.</a>
<a id='line_1754'></a>
<a id='line_1755'>30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the</a>
<a id='line_1756'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_1757'></a>
<a id='line_1758'>30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</a>
<a id='line_1759'></a>
<a id='line_1760'>30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</a>
<a id='line_1761'></a>
<a id='line_1762'>30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice</a>
<a id='line_1763'>of them that weep.</a>
<a id='line_1764'></a>
<a id='line_1765'>31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a</a>
<a id='line_1766'>maid?  31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what</a>
<a id='line_1767'>inheritance of the Almighty from on high?  31:3 Is not destruction to</a>
<a id='line_1768'>the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?  31:4</a>
<a id='line_1769'>Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?  31:5 If I have</a>
<a id='line_1770'>walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 31:6 Let me</a>
<a id='line_1771'>be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.</a>
<a id='line_1772'></a>
<a id='line_1773'>31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked</a>
<a id='line_1774'>after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 31:8 Then</a>
<a id='line_1775'>let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</a>
<a id='line_1776'></a>
<a id='line_1777'>31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid</a>
<a id='line_1778'>wait at my neighbours door; 31:10 Then let my wife grind unto</a>
<a id='line_1779'>another, and let others bow down upon her.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be</a>
<a id='line_1782'>punished by the judges.</a>
<a id='line_1783'></a>
<a id='line_1784'>31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root</a>
<a id='line_1785'>out all mine increase.</a>
<a id='line_1786'></a>
<a id='line_1787'>31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my</a>
<a id='line_1788'>maidservant, when they contended with me; 31:14 What then shall I do</a>
<a id='line_1789'>when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</a>
<a id='line_1790'>31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one</a>
<a id='line_1791'>fashion us in the womb?  31:16 If I have withheld the poor from their</a>
<a id='line_1792'>desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 31:17 Or have</a>
<a id='line_1793'>eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten</a>
<a id='line_1794'>thereof; 31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a</a>
<a id='line_1795'>father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;) 31:19 If I have</a>
<a id='line_1796'>seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</a>
<a id='line_1797'>31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with</a>
<a id='line_1798'>the fleece of my sheep; 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the</a>
<a id='line_1799'>fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 31:22 Then let mine arm</a>
<a id='line_1800'>fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</a>
<a id='line_1801'></a>
<a id='line_1802'>31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of</a>
<a id='line_1803'>his highness I could not endure.</a>
<a id='line_1804'></a>
<a id='line_1805'>31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou</a>
<a id='line_1806'>art my confidence; 31:25 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and</a>
<a id='line_1807'>because mine hand had gotten much; 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it</a>
<a id='line_1808'>shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 31:27 And my heart hath</a>
<a id='line_1809'>been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 31:28 This</a>
<a id='line_1810'>also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have</a>
<a id='line_1811'>denied the God that is above.</a>
<a id='line_1812'></a>
<a id='line_1813'>31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted</a>
<a id='line_1814'>up myself when evil found him: 31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth</a>
<a id='line_1815'>to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</a>
<a id='line_1816'></a>
<a id='line_1817'>31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his</a>
<a id='line_1818'>flesh!  we cannot be satisfied.</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors</a>
<a id='line_1821'>to the traveller.</a>
<a id='line_1822'></a>
<a id='line_1823'>31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity</a>
<a id='line_1824'>in my bosom: 31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt</a>
<a id='line_1825'>of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the</a>
<a id='line_1826'>door?  31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the</a>
<a id='line_1827'>Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown</a>
<a id='line_1830'>to me.</a>
<a id='line_1831'></a>
<a id='line_1832'>31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince</a>
<a id='line_1833'>would I go near unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1834'></a>
<a id='line_1835'>31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof</a>
<a id='line_1836'>complain; 31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or</a>
<a id='line_1837'>have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 31:40 Let thistles</a>
<a id='line_1838'>grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'>The words of Job are ended.</a>
<a id='line_1841'></a>
<a id='line_1842'>32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous</a>
<a id='line_1843'>in his own eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1844'></a>
<a id='line_1845'>32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the</a>
<a id='line_1846'>Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled,</a>
<a id='line_1847'>because he justified himself rather than God.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because</a>
<a id='line_1850'>they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder</a>
<a id='line_1853'>than he.</a>
<a id='line_1854'></a>
<a id='line_1855'>32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these</a>
<a id='line_1856'>three men, then his wrath was kindled.</a>
<a id='line_1857'></a>
<a id='line_1858'>32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am</a>
<a id='line_1859'>young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew</a>
<a id='line_1860'>you mine opinion.</a>
<a id='line_1861'></a>
<a id='line_1862'>32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach</a>
<a id='line_1863'>wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_1864'></a>
<a id='line_1865'>32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty</a>
<a id='line_1866'>giveth them understanding.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand</a>
<a id='line_1869'>judgment.</a>
<a id='line_1870'></a>
<a id='line_1871'>32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</a>
<a id='line_1872'></a>
<a id='line_1873'>32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>whilst ye searched out what to say.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you</a>
<a id='line_1877'>that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 32:13 Lest ye should</a>
<a id='line_1878'>say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</a>
<a id='line_1879'></a>
<a id='line_1880'>32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I</a>
<a id='line_1881'>answer him with your speeches.</a>
<a id='line_1882'></a>
<a id='line_1883'>32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and</a>
<a id='line_1886'>answered no more;) 32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also</a>
<a id='line_1887'>will shew mine opinion.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</a>
<a id='line_1890'></a>
<a id='line_1891'>32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to</a>
<a id='line_1892'>burst like new bottles.</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and</a>
<a id='line_1895'>answer.</a>
<a id='line_1896'></a>
<a id='line_1897'>32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me</a>
<a id='line_1898'>give flattering titles unto man.</a>
<a id='line_1899'></a>
<a id='line_1900'>32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker</a>
<a id='line_1901'>would soon take me away.</a>
<a id='line_1902'></a>
<a id='line_1903'>33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all</a>
<a id='line_1904'>my words.</a>
<a id='line_1905'></a>
<a id='line_1906'>33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my</a>

<a id='line_1908'></a>
<a id='line_1909'>33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips</a>

<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty</a>

<a id='line_1928'>33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his</a>

<a id='line_1942'>of men, and sealeth their instruction, 33:17 That he may withdraw man</a>
<a id='line_1943'>from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</a>

<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his</a>

<a id='line_1962'></a>
<a id='line_1963'>33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to</a>

<a id='line_1968'>33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and</a>
<a id='line_1969'>perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 33:28 He will</a>

<a id='line_2006'></a>
<a id='line_2007'>34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it</a>
<a id='line_2008'>from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he</a>
<a id='line_2009'>should commit iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_2010'></a>
<a id='line_2011'>34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every</a>
<a id='line_2012'>man to find according to his ways.</a>
<a id='line_2013'></a>
<a id='line_2014'>34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty</a>

<a id='line_2016'></a>
<a id='line_2017'>34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed</a>
<a id='line_2018'>the whole world?  34:14 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather</a>
<a id='line_2019'>unto himself his spirit and his breath; 34:15 All flesh shall perish</a>
<a id='line_2020'>together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</a>
<a id='line_2021'></a>
<a id='line_2022'>34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice</a>
<a id='line_2023'>of my words.</a>
<a id='line_2024'></a>
<a id='line_2025'>34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn</a>
<a id='line_2026'>him that is most just?  34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art</a>
<a id='line_2027'>wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?  34:19 How much less to him</a>
<a id='line_2028'>that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more</a>
<a id='line_2029'>than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</a>
<a id='line_2030'></a>
<a id='line_2031'>34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at</a>
<a id='line_2032'>midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without</a>
<a id='line_2033'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_2034'></a>
<a id='line_2035'>34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his</a>
<a id='line_2036'>goings.</a>
<a id='line_2037'></a>
<a id='line_2038'>34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of</a>

<a id='line_2040'></a>
<a id='line_2041'>34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should</a>
<a id='line_2042'>enter into judgment with God.</a>
<a id='line_2043'></a>
<a id='line_2044'>34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set</a>
<a id='line_2045'>others in their stead.</a>
<a id='line_2046'></a>
<a id='line_2047'>34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the</a>
<a id='line_2048'>night, so that they are destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_2049'></a>
<a id='line_2050'>34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</a>
<a id='line_2051'>34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of</a>
<a id='line_2052'>his ways: 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto</a>
<a id='line_2053'>him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</a>
<a id='line_2054'></a>
<a id='line_2055'>34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he</a>
<a id='line_2056'>hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a</a>
<a id='line_2057'>nation, or against a man only: 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not,</a>
<a id='line_2058'>lest the people be ensnared.</a>
<a id='line_2059'></a>
<a id='line_2060'>34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne</a>
<a id='line_2061'>chastisement, I will not offend any more: 34:32 That which I see not</a>
<a id='line_2062'>teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</a>
<a id='line_2063'></a>
<a id='line_2064'>34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,</a>
<a id='line_2065'>whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore</a>
<a id='line_2066'>speak what thou knowest.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken</a>
<a id='line_2069'>unto me.</a>
<a id='line_2070'></a>
<a id='line_2071'>34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without</a>
<a id='line_2072'>wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_2073'></a>
<a id='line_2074'>34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his</a>
<a id='line_2075'>answers for wicked men.</a>
<a id='line_2076'></a>
<a id='line_2077'>34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands</a>
<a id='line_2078'>among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</a>
<a id='line_2079'></a>
<a id='line_2080'>35:1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be</a>
<a id='line_2081'>right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?  35:3</a>
<a id='line_2082'>For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit</a>
<a id='line_2083'>shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?  35:4 I will answer thee,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>and thy companions with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2085'></a>
<a id='line_2086'>35:5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are</a>
<a id='line_2087'>higher than thou.</a>
<a id='line_2088'></a>
<a id='line_2089'>35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy</a>
<a id='line_2090'>transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?  35:7 If thou</a>
<a id='line_2091'>be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine</a>
<a id='line_2092'>hand?  35:8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy</a>
<a id='line_2093'>righteousness may profit the son of man.</a>
<a id='line_2094'></a>
<a id='line_2095'>35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed</a>
<a id='line_2096'>to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</a>
<a id='line_2097'></a>
<a id='line_2098'>35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the</a>
<a id='line_2099'>night; 35:11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_2100'>maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?  35:12 There they cry, but</a>
<a id='line_2101'>none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</a>
<a id='line_2102'></a>
<a id='line_2103'>35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty</a>
<a id='line_2104'>regard it.</a>
<a id='line_2105'></a>
<a id='line_2106'>35:14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is</a>
<a id='line_2107'>before him; therefore trust thou in him.</a>
<a id='line_2108'></a>
<a id='line_2109'>35:15 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet</a>
<a id='line_2110'>he knoweth it not in great extremity: 35:16 Therefore doth Job open</a>
<a id='line_2111'>his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_2112'></a>
<a id='line_2113'>36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I</a>
<a id='line_2114'>will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.</a>
<a id='line_2115'></a>
<a id='line_2116'>36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe</a>
<a id='line_2117'>righteousness to my Maker.</a>
<a id='line_2118'></a>
<a id='line_2119'>36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in</a>
<a id='line_2120'>knowledge is with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2121'></a>
<a id='line_2122'>36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in</a>
<a id='line_2123'>strength and wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_2124'></a>
<a id='line_2125'>36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the</a>
<a id='line_2126'>poor.</a>
<a id='line_2127'></a>
<a id='line_2128'>36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings</a>
<a id='line_2129'>are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they</a>
<a id='line_2130'>are exalted.</a>
<a id='line_2131'></a>
<a id='line_2132'>36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of</a>
<a id='line_2133'>affliction; 36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their</a>
<a id='line_2134'>transgressions that they have exceeded.</a>
<a id='line_2135'></a>
<a id='line_2136'>36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that</a>
<a id='line_2137'>they return from iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_2138'></a>
<a id='line_2139'>36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in</a>
<a id='line_2140'>prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</a>
<a id='line_2141'></a>
<a id='line_2142'>36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they</a>
<a id='line_2143'>shall die without knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_2144'></a>
<a id='line_2145'>36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he</a>
<a id='line_2146'>bindeth them.</a>
<a id='line_2147'></a>
<a id='line_2148'>36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears</a>
<a id='line_2151'>in oppression.</a>
<a id='line_2152'></a>
<a id='line_2153'>36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a</a>
<a id='line_2154'>broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be</a>
<a id='line_2155'>set on thy table should be full of fatness.</a>
<a id='line_2156'></a>
<a id='line_2157'>36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and</a>
<a id='line_2158'>justice take hold on thee.</a>
<a id='line_2159'></a>
<a id='line_2160'>36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his</a>
<a id='line_2161'>stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</a>
<a id='line_2162'></a>
<a id='line_2163'>36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of</a>
<a id='line_2164'>strength.</a>
<a id='line_2165'></a>
<a id='line_2166'>36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</a>
<a id='line_2167'></a>
<a id='line_2168'>36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather</a>
<a id='line_2169'>than affliction.</a>
<a id='line_2170'></a>
<a id='line_2171'>36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?  36:23</a>
<a id='line_2172'>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought</a>
<a id='line_2173'>iniquity?  36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men</a>
<a id='line_2174'>behold.</a>
<a id='line_2175'></a>
<a id='line_2176'>36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</a>
<a id='line_2177'></a>
<a id='line_2178'>36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the</a>
<a id='line_2179'>number of his years be searched out.</a>
<a id='line_2180'></a>
<a id='line_2181'>36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain</a>
<a id='line_2182'>according to the vapour thereof: 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and</a>
<a id='line_2183'>distil upon man abundantly.</a>
<a id='line_2184'></a>
<a id='line_2185'>36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the</a>
<a id='line_2186'>noise of his tabernacle?  36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon</a>
<a id='line_2187'>it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_2188'></a>
<a id='line_2189'>36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</a>
<a id='line_2190'></a>
<a id='line_2191'>36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to</a>
<a id='line_2192'>shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</a>
<a id='line_2193'></a>
<a id='line_2194'>36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also</a>
<a id='line_2195'>concerning the vapour.</a>
<a id='line_2196'></a>
<a id='line_2197'>37:1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</a>
<a id='line_2198'></a>
<a id='line_2199'>37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth</a>
<a id='line_2200'>out of his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2201'></a>
<a id='line_2202'>37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto</a>
<a id='line_2203'>the ends of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his</a>
<a id='line_2206'>excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</a>
<a id='line_2207'></a>
<a id='line_2208'>37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth</a>
<a id='line_2209'>he, which we cannot comprehend.</a>
<a id='line_2210'></a>
<a id='line_2211'>37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the</a>
<a id='line_2212'>small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</a>
<a id='line_2213'></a>
<a id='line_2214'>37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his</a>
<a id='line_2215'>work.</a>
<a id='line_2216'></a>
<a id='line_2217'>37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</a>
<a id='line_2218'></a>
<a id='line_2219'>37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</a>
<a id='line_2220'></a>
<a id='line_2221'>37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the</a>
<a id='line_2222'>waters is straitened.</a>
<a id='line_2223'></a>
<a id='line_2224'>37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his</a>
<a id='line_2225'>bright cloud: 37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that</a>
<a id='line_2226'>they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world</a>
<a id='line_2227'>in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_2228'></a>
<a id='line_2229'>37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,</a>
<a id='line_2230'>or for mercy.</a>
<a id='line_2231'></a>
<a id='line_2232'>37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous</a>
<a id='line_2233'>works of God.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>

<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>41:22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy</a>
<a id='line_2490'>before him.</a>
<a id='line_2491'></a>
<a id='line_2492'>41:23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in</a>

<a id='line_2494'></a>
<a id='line_2495'>41:24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the</a>

<a id='line_2536'>42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye</a>
<a id='line_2537'>seeth thee.</a>
<a id='line_2538'></a>
<a id='line_2539'>42:6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</a>
<a id='line_2540'></a>
<a id='line_2541'>42:7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto</a>
<a id='line_2542'>Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled</a>
<a id='line_2543'>against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of</a>
<a id='line_2544'>me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</a>
<a id='line_2545'></a>
<a id='line_2546'>42:8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go</a>
<a id='line_2547'>to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and</a>
<a id='line_2548'>my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal</a>
<a id='line_2549'>with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing</a>
<a id='line_2550'>which is right, like my servant Job.</a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'>42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the</a>
<a id='line_2553'>Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the</a>
<a id='line_2554'>LORD also accepted Job.</a>
<a id='line_2555'></a>
<a id='line_2556'>42:10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his</a>
<a id='line_2557'>friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</a>
<a id='line_2558'></a>
<a id='line_2559'>42:11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters,</a>
<a id='line_2560'>and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat</a>
<a id='line_2561'>bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him</a>
<a id='line_2562'>over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also</a>
<a id='line_2563'>gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</a>
<a id='line_2564'></a>
<a id='line_2565'>42:12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his</a>
<a id='line_2566'>beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand</a>
<a id='line_2567'>camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</a>
<a id='line_2568'></a>
<a id='line_2569'>42:13 He had also seven sons and three daughters.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>42:14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2572'>second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>42:15 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters</a>
<a id='line_2575'>of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</a>
<a id='line_2576'></a>
<a id='line_2577'>42:16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his</a>
<a id='line_2578'>sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>42:17 So Job died, being old and full of days.</a>
<a id='line_2581'></a>
<a id='line_2582'></a>
