                    <a id='line_0'>The Fifth Book of Moses:  Called Deuteronomy</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side</a>
<a id='line_4'>Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,</a>
<a id='line_5'>between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 (There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount</a>
<a id='line_8'>Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth</a>
<a id='line_9'>year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses</a>
<a id='line_10'>spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_11'>had given him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihon</a>
<a id='line_12'>the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of</a>
<a id='line_13'>Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, in</a>
<a id='line_14'>the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 1:6 The</a>
<a id='line_15'>LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough</a>
<a id='line_16'>in this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the</a>
<a id='line_17'>mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the</a>
<a id='line_18'>plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea</a>
<a id='line_19'>side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great</a>
<a id='line_20'>river, the river Euphrates.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land</a>
<a id='line_23'>which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to</a>
<a id='line_24'>give unto them and to their seed after them.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear</a>
<a id='line_27'>you myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,</a>
<a id='line_28'>behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many</a>
<a id='line_31'>more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How can</a>
<a id='line_32'>I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</a>
<a id='line_33'>1:13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your</a>
<a id='line_34'>tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is</a>
<a id='line_37'>good for us to do.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made</a>
<a id='line_40'>them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over</a>
<a id='line_41'>hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and</a>
<a id='line_42'>officers among your tribes.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes</a>
<a id='line_45'>between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his</a>
<a id='line_46'>brother, and the stranger that is with him.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the</a>
<a id='line_49'>small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;</a>
<a id='line_50'>for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you,</a>
<a id='line_51'>bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should</a>
<a id='line_54'>do.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great</a>
<a id='line_57'>and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_58'>the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to</a>
<a id='line_59'>Kadeshbarnea.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the</a>
<a id='line_62'>Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>1:21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and</a>
<a id='line_65'>possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear</a>
<a id='line_66'>not, neither be discouraged.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>1:22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send</a>
<a id='line_69'>men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us</a>
<a id='line_70'>word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall</a>
<a id='line_71'>come.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>1:23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one</a>
<a id='line_74'>of a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and</a>
<a id='line_75'>came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and</a>
<a id='line_78'>brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a</a>
<a id='line_79'>good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>1:26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the</a>
<a id='line_82'>commandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,</a>
<a id='line_83'>and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of</a>
<a id='line_84'>the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to</a>
<a id='line_85'>destroy us.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>1:28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,</a>
<a id='line_88'>saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great</a>
<a id='line_89'>and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the</a>
<a id='line_90'>Anakims there.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>1:30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,</a>
<a id='line_95'>according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 1:31</a>
<a id='line_96'>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God</a>
<a id='line_97'>bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,</a>
<a id='line_98'>until ye came into this place.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>1:32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Who</a>
<a id='line_101'>went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your</a>
<a id='line_102'>tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and</a>
<a id='line_103'>in a cloud by day.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>1:34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and</a>
<a id='line_106'>sware, saying, 1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this</a>
<a id='line_107'>evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your</a>
<a id='line_108'>fathers.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will</a>
<a id='line_111'>I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,</a>
<a id='line_112'>because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also</a>
<a id='line_115'>shalt not go in thither.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall</a>
<a id='line_118'>go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>1:39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and</a>
<a id='line_121'>your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and</a>
<a id='line_122'>evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they</a>
<a id='line_123'>shall possess it.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the</a>
<a id='line_126'>wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>1:41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the</a>
<a id='line_129'>LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God</a>
<a id='line_130'>commanded us.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready</a>
<a id='line_133'>to go up into the hill.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither</a>
<a id='line_136'>fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>1:43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against</a>
<a id='line_139'>the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>1:44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against</a>
<a id='line_142'>you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto</a>
<a id='line_143'>Hormah.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>1:45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not</a>
<a id='line_146'>hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye</a>
<a id='line_149'>abode there.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the</a>
<a id='line_152'>way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount</a>
<a id='line_153'>Seir many days.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>2:2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed this</a>
<a id='line_156'>mountain long enough: turn you northward.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>2:4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the</a>
<a id='line_159'>coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and</a>
<a id='line_160'>they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves</a>
<a id='line_161'>therefore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their</a>
<a id='line_162'>land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount</a>
<a id='line_163'>Seir unto Esau for a possession.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>2:6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_166'>also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy</a>
<a id='line_169'>hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these</a>
<a id='line_170'>forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked</a>
<a id='line_171'>nothing.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>2:8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,</a>
<a id='line_174'>which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from</a>
<a id='line_175'>Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither</a>
<a id='line_178'>contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land</a>
<a id='line_179'>for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for</a>
<a id='line_180'>a possession.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>2:10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,</a>
<a id='line_183'>and tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, as</a>
<a id='line_184'>the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of</a>
<a id='line_187'>Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,</a>
<a id='line_188'>and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his</a>
<a id='line_189'>possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we</a>
<a id='line_192'>went over the brook Zered.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>2:14 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were</a>
<a id='line_195'>come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the</a>
<a id='line_196'>generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as</a>
<a id='line_197'>the LORD sware unto them.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them</a>
<a id='line_200'>from among the host, until they were consumed.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and</a>
<a id='line_203'>dead from among the people, 2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</a>
<a id='line_204'>2:18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</a>
<a id='line_205'>2:19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,</a>
<a id='line_206'>distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of</a>
<a id='line_207'>the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given</a>
<a id='line_208'>it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein</a>
<a id='line_211'>in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 2:21 A people</a>
<a id='line_212'>great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them</a>
<a id='line_213'>before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 2:22</a>
<a id='line_214'>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he</a>
<a id='line_215'>destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and</a>
<a id='line_216'>dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 2:23 And the Avims which</a>
<a id='line_217'>dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth</a>
<a id='line_218'>out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)  2:24 Rise</a>
<a id='line_219'>ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I</a>
<a id='line_220'>have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his</a>
<a id='line_221'>land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of</a>
<a id='line_224'>thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear</a>
<a id='line_225'>report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto</a>
<a id='line_228'>Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 2:27 Let me pass</a>
<a id='line_229'>through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn</a>
<a id='line_230'>unto the right hand nor to the left.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>2:28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me</a>
<a id='line_233'>water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my</a>
<a id='line_234'>feet; 2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the</a>
<a id='line_235'>Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over</a>
<a id='line_236'>Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the</a>
<a id='line_239'>LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that</a>
<a id='line_240'>he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>2:31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and</a>
<a id='line_243'>his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his</a>
<a id='line_244'>land.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight</a>
<a id='line_247'>at Jahaz.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,</a>
<a id='line_250'>and his sons, and all his people.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed</a>
<a id='line_253'>the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left</a>
<a id='line_254'>none to remain: 2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto</a>
<a id='line_255'>ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>2:36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from</a>
<a id='line_258'>the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one</a>
<a id='line_259'>city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 2:37</a>
<a id='line_260'>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto</a>
<a id='line_261'>any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains,</a>
<a id='line_262'>nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of</a>
<a id='line_265'>Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>3:2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,</a>
<a id='line_268'>and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do</a>
<a id='line_269'>unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at</a>
<a id='line_270'>Heshbon.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>3:3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of</a>
<a id='line_273'>Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to</a>
<a id='line_274'>him remaining.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>3:4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city</a>
<a id='line_277'>which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of</a>
<a id='line_278'>Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>3:5 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;</a>
<a id='line_281'>beside unwalled towns a great many.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of</a>
<a id='line_284'>Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every</a>
<a id='line_285'>city.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a</a>
<a id='line_288'>prey to ourselves.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>3:8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the</a>
<a id='line_291'>Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of</a>
<a id='line_292'>Arnon unto mount Hermon; 3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;</a>
<a id='line_293'>and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 3:10 All the cities of the plain,</a>
<a id='line_294'>and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the</a>
<a id='line_295'>kingdom of Og in Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>3:11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;</a>
<a id='line_298'>behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of</a>
<a id='line_299'>the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four</a>
<a id='line_300'>cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>3:12 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which</a>
<a id='line_303'>is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,</a>
<a id='line_304'>gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>3:13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,</a>
<a id='line_307'>gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with</a>
<a id='line_308'>all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the</a>
<a id='line_311'>coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,</a>
<a id='line_312'>Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>3:15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>3:16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead</a>
<a id='line_317'>even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto</a>
<a id='line_318'>the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 3:17</a>
<a id='line_319'>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth</a>
<a id='line_320'>even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah</a>
<a id='line_321'>eastward.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>3:18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath</a>
<a id='line_324'>given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before</a>
<a id='line_325'>your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</a>
<a id='line_326'></a>
<a id='line_327'>3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I</a>
<a id='line_328'>know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I</a>
<a id='line_329'>have given you; 3:20 Until the LORD have given rest unto your</a>
<a id='line_330'>brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land</a>
<a id='line_331'>which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall</a>
<a id='line_332'>ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen</a>
<a id='line_335'>all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall</a>
<a id='line_336'>the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>3:22 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for</a>
<a id='line_339'>you.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>3:23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 3:24 O Lord GOD,</a>
<a id='line_342'>thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty</a>
<a id='line_343'>hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do</a>
<a id='line_344'>according to thy works, and according to thy might?  3:25 I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_345'>let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that</a>
<a id='line_346'>goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>3:26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear</a>
<a id='line_349'>me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto</a>
<a id='line_350'>me of this matter.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>3:27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes</a>
<a id='line_353'>westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it</a>
<a id='line_354'>with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he</a>
<a id='line_357'>shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit</a>
<a id='line_358'>the land which thou shalt see.</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>3:29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>4:1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the</a>
<a id='line_363'>judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go</a>
<a id='line_364'>in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>4:2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall</a>
<a id='line_367'>ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the</a>
<a id='line_368'>LORD your God which I command you.</a>
<a id='line_369'></a>
<a id='line_370'>4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all</a>
<a id='line_371'>the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them</a>
<a id='line_372'>from among you.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>4:4 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one</a>
<a id='line_375'>of you this day.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_378'>my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to</a>
<a id='line_379'>possess it.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your</a>
<a id='line_382'>understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these</a>
<a id='line_383'>statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and</a>
<a id='line_384'>understanding people.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>4:7 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,</a>
<a id='line_387'>as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?  4:8</a>
<a id='line_388'>And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so</a>
<a id='line_389'>righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?  4:9 Only</a>
<a id='line_390'>take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget</a>
<a id='line_391'>the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy</a>
<a id='line_392'>heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’</a>
<a id='line_393'>sons; 4:10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_394'>God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people</a>
<a id='line_395'>together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to</a>
<a id='line_396'>fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that</a>
<a id='line_397'>they may teach their children.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>4:11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain</a>
<a id='line_400'>burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and</a>
<a id='line_401'>thick darkness.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>4:12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye</a>
<a id='line_404'>heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a</a>
<a id='line_405'>voice.</a>
<a id='line_406'></a>
<a id='line_407'>4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to</a>
<a id='line_408'>perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of</a>
<a id='line_409'>stone.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and</a>
<a id='line_412'>judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to</a>
<a id='line_413'>possess it.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>4:15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner</a>
<a id='line_416'>of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of</a>
<a id='line_417'>the midst of the fire: 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a</a>
<a id='line_418'>graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or</a>
<a id='line_419'>female, 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the</a>
<a id='line_420'>likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 4:18 The likeness</a>
<a id='line_421'>of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish</a>
<a id='line_422'>that is in the waters beneath the earth: 4:19 And lest thou lift up</a>
<a id='line_423'>thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and</a>
<a id='line_424'>the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship</a>
<a id='line_425'>them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all</a>
<a id='line_426'>nations under the whole heaven.</a>
<a id='line_427'></a>
<a id='line_428'>4:20 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the</a>
<a id='line_429'>iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of</a>
<a id='line_430'>inheritance, as ye are this day.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>4:21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware</a>
<a id='line_433'>that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto</a>
<a id='line_434'>that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:</a>
<a id='line_435'>4:22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye</a>
<a id='line_436'>shall go over, and possess that good land.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>4:23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the</a>
<a id='line_439'>LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or</a>
<a id='line_440'>the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.</a>
<a id='line_441'></a>
<a id='line_442'>4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>4:25 When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye</a>
<a id='line_445'>shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,</a>
<a id='line_446'>and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do</a>
<a id='line_447'>evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 4:26 I</a>
<a id='line_448'>call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_449'>soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to</a>
<a id='line_450'>possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly</a>
<a id='line_451'>be destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>4:27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_454'>left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>4:28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and</a>
<a id='line_457'>stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>4:29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_460'>find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>4:30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon</a>
<a id='line_463'>thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and</a>
<a id='line_464'>shalt be obedient unto his voice; 4:31 (For the LORD thy God is a</a>
<a id='line_465'>merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor</a>
<a id='line_466'>forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,</a>
<a id='line_469'>since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the</a>
<a id='line_470'>one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such</a>
<a id='line_471'>thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  4:33 Did</a>
<a id='line_472'>ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_473'>fire, as thou hast heard, and live?  4:34 Or hath God assayed to go</a>
<a id='line_474'>and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by</a>
<a id='line_475'>temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty</a>
<a id='line_476'>hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to</a>
<a id='line_477'>all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</a>
<a id='line_478'>4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he</a>
<a id='line_479'>is God; there is none else beside him.</a>
<a id='line_480'></a>
<a id='line_481'>4:36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might</a>
<a id='line_482'>instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou</a>
<a id='line_483'>heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>4:37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed</a>
<a id='line_486'>after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power</a>
<a id='line_487'>out of Egypt; 4:38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and</a>
<a id='line_488'>mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for</a>
<a id='line_489'>an inheritance, as it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>4:39 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the</a>
<a id='line_492'>LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is</a>
<a id='line_493'>none else.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>4:40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,</a>
<a id='line_496'>which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with</a>
<a id='line_497'>thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon</a>
<a id='line_498'>the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>4:41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the</a>
<a id='line_501'>sunrising; 4:42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill</a>
<a id='line_502'>his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that</a>
<a id='line_503'>fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 4:43 Namely, Bezer in</a>
<a id='line_504'>the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in</a>
<a id='line_505'>Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>4:44 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of</a>
<a id='line_508'>Israel: 4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the</a>
<a id='line_509'>judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they</a>
<a id='line_510'>came forth out of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>4:46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the</a>
<a id='line_513'>land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses</a>
<a id='line_514'>and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of</a>
<a id='line_515'>Egypt: 4:47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of</a>
<a id='line_516'>Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan</a>
<a id='line_517'>toward the sunrising; 4:48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the</a>
<a id='line_518'>river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 4:49 And all the</a>
<a id='line_519'>plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain,</a>
<a id='line_520'>under the springs of Pisgah.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>5:1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,</a>
<a id='line_523'>the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that</a>
<a id='line_524'>ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,</a>
<a id='line_529'>even us, who are all of us here alive this day.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the</a>
<a id='line_532'>midst of the fire, 5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,</a>
<a id='line_533'>to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the</a>
<a id='line_534'>fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 5:6 I am the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_535'>God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of</a>
<a id='line_536'>bondage.</a>
<a id='line_537'></a>
<a id='line_538'>5:7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.</a>

<a id='line_541'>thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or</a>
<a id='line_542'>that is in the waters beneath the earth: 5:9 Thou shalt not bow down</a>
<a id='line_543'>thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous</a>
<a id='line_544'>God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the</a>
<a id='line_545'>third and fourth generation of them that hate me, 5:10 And shewing</a>
<a id='line_546'>mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>5:11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the</a>

<a id='line_551'>5:12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath</a>
<a id='line_552'>commanded thee.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>5:13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But the</a>
<a id='line_555'>seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not</a>

<a id='line_557'>nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy</a>

<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and</a>
<a id='line_562'>that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand</a>
<a id='line_563'>and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee</a>
<a id='line_564'>to keep the sabbath day.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>5:16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath</a>
<a id='line_567'>commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go</a>
<a id='line_568'>well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</a>
<a id='line_569'></a>
<a id='line_570'>5:17 Thou shalt not kill.</a>

<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>5:22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount</a>
<a id='line_583'>out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness,</a>
<a id='line_584'>with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two</a>
<a id='line_585'>tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>5:23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of</a>
<a id='line_588'>the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near</a>
<a id='line_589'>unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 5:24 And</a>
<a id='line_590'>ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his</a>
<a id='line_591'>greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:</a>
<a id='line_592'>we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>5:25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume</a>
<a id='line_595'>us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall</a>
<a id='line_596'>die.</a>
<a id='line_597'></a>
<a id='line_598'>5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_599'>living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and</a>

<a id='line_601'>say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto</a>
<a id='line_602'>thee; and we will hear it, and do it.</a>
<a id='line_603'></a>
<a id='line_604'>5:28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto</a>
<a id='line_605'>me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of</a>

<a id='line_611'>and with their children for ever!  5:30 Go say to them, Get you into</a>
<a id='line_612'>your tents again.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>5:31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto</a>
<a id='line_615'>thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which</a>
<a id='line_616'>thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give</a>
<a id='line_617'>them to possess it.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>5:32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath</a>
<a id='line_620'>commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the</a>
<a id='line_621'>left.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>5:33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath</a>
<a id='line_624'>commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and</a>
<a id='line_625'>that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>6:1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,</a>
<a id='line_628'>which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them</a>
<a id='line_629'>in the land whither ye go to possess it: 6:2 That thou mightest fear</a>
<a id='line_630'>the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which</a>
<a id='line_631'>I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of</a>
<a id='line_632'>thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be</a>
<a id='line_635'>well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of</a>
<a id='line_636'>thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and</a>
<a id='line_637'>honey.</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 6:5 And thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_640'>love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and</a>
<a id='line_641'>with all thy might.</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>6:6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine</a>
<a id='line_644'>heart: 6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and</a>
<a id='line_645'>shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou</a>
<a id='line_646'>walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>6:8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they</a>
<a id='line_649'>shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_650'></a>
<a id='line_651'>6:9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy</a>
<a id='line_652'>gates.</a>
<a id='line_653'></a>
<a id='line_654'>6:10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee</a>
<a id='line_655'>into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,</a>
<a id='line_656'>and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou</a>
<a id='line_657'>buildedst not, 6:11 And houses full of all good things, which thou</a>
<a id='line_658'>filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and</a>
<a id='line_659'>olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and</a>
<a id='line_660'>be full; 6:12 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought</a>
<a id='line_661'>thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</a>
<a id='line_662'></a>
<a id='line_663'>6:13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear</a>
<a id='line_664'>by his name.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>6:14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which</a>
<a id='line_667'>are round about you; 6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among</a>
<a id='line_668'>you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and</a>
<a id='line_669'>destroy thee from off the face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>6:16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in</a>
<a id='line_672'>Massah.</a>
<a id='line_673'></a>
<a id='line_674'>6:17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,</a>
<a id='line_675'>and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.</a>
<a id='line_676'></a>
<a id='line_677'>6:18 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_678'>the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in</a>
<a id='line_679'>and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>6:19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_682'>spoken.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>6:20 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean</a>
<a id='line_685'>the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_686'>our God hath commanded you?  6:21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We</a>
<a id='line_687'>were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt</a>
<a id='line_688'>with a mighty hand: 6:22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great</a>
<a id='line_689'>and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before</a>
<a id='line_690'>our eyes: 6:23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring</a>
<a id='line_691'>us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.</a>
<a id='line_692'></a>
<a id='line_693'>6:24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the</a>
<a id='line_694'>LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as</a>
<a id='line_695'>it is at this day.</a>
<a id='line_696'></a>
<a id='line_697'>6:25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these</a>
<a id='line_698'>commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.</a>
<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>7:1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou</a>
<a id='line_701'>goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the</a>
<a id='line_702'>Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,</a>
<a id='line_703'>and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations</a>
<a id='line_704'>greater and mightier than thou; 7:2 And when the LORD thy God shall</a>
<a id='line_705'>deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy</a>
<a id='line_706'>them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:</a>
<a id='line_707'>7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou</a>
<a id='line_708'>shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy</a>
<a id='line_709'>son.</a>
<a id='line_710'></a>
<a id='line_711'>7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may</a>
<a id='line_712'>serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against</a>
<a id='line_713'>you, and destroy thee suddenly.</a>
<a id='line_714'></a>
<a id='line_715'>7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,</a>
<a id='line_716'>and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their</a>
<a id='line_717'>graven images with fire.</a>
<a id='line_718'></a>
<a id='line_719'>7:6 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_720'>God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all</a>
<a id='line_721'>people that are upon the face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_722'></a>
<a id='line_723'>7:7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye</a>
<a id='line_724'>were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all</a>
<a id='line_725'>people: 7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep</a>
<a id='line_726'>the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought</a>
<a id='line_727'>you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of</a>
<a id='line_728'>bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>7:9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,</a>
<a id='line_731'>which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his</a>
<a id='line_732'>commandments to a thousand generations; 7:10 And repayeth them that</a>
<a id='line_733'>hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him</a>
<a id='line_734'>that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>7:11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and</a>
<a id='line_737'>the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.</a>
<a id='line_738'></a>
<a id='line_739'>7:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these</a>
<a id='line_740'>judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep</a>
<a id='line_741'>unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</a>
<a id='line_742'>7:13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will</a>
<a id='line_743'>also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,</a>
<a id='line_744'>and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks</a>
<a id='line_745'>of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give</a>
<a id='line_746'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>7:14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male</a>
<a id='line_749'>or female barren among you, or among your cattle.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>7:15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put</a>
<a id='line_752'>none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but</a>
<a id='line_753'>will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</a>
<a id='line_754'></a>
<a id='line_755'>7:16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God</a>
<a id='line_756'>shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither</a>
<a id='line_757'>shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_758'></a>
<a id='line_759'>7:17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;</a>
<a id='line_760'>how can I dispossess them?  7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but</a>
<a id='line_761'>shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto</a>
<a id='line_762'>all Egypt; 7:19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the</a>
<a id='line_763'>signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out</a>
<a id='line_764'>arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_765'>God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>7:20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until</a>
<a id='line_768'>they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is</a>
<a id='line_771'>among you, a mighty God and terrible.</a>
<a id='line_772'></a>
<a id='line_773'>7:22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by</a>
<a id='line_774'>little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the</a>
<a id='line_775'>beasts of the field increase upon thee.</a>
<a id='line_776'></a>
<a id='line_777'>7:23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall</a>
<a id='line_778'>destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.</a>
<a id='line_779'></a>
<a id='line_780'>7:24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_781'>destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to</a>
<a id='line_782'>stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>7:25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou</a>
<a id='line_785'>shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto</a>
<a id='line_786'>thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD</a>
<a id='line_787'>thy God.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>7:26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest</a>
<a id='line_790'>thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and</a>
<a id='line_791'>thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>8:1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye</a>
<a id='line_794'>observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess</a>
<a id='line_795'>the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led</a>
<a id='line_798'>thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove</a>
<a id='line_799'>thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his</a>
<a id='line_800'>commandments, or no.</a>
<a id='line_801'></a>
<a id='line_802'>8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee</a>
<a id='line_803'>with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that</a>
<a id='line_804'>he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by</a>
<a id='line_805'>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>8:4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,</a>
<a id='line_808'>these forty years.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>8:5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth</a>
<a id='line_811'>his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.</a>
<a id='line_812'></a>
<a id='line_813'>8:6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to</a>
<a id='line_814'>walk in his ways, and to fear him.</a>
<a id='line_815'></a>
<a id='line_816'>8:7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of</a>
<a id='line_817'>brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys</a>
<a id='line_818'>and hills; 8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,</a>
<a id='line_819'>and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 8:9 A land wherein</a>
<a id='line_820'>thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing</a>
<a id='line_821'>in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou</a>
<a id='line_822'>mayest dig brass.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>8:10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD</a>
<a id='line_825'>thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.</a>
<a id='line_826'></a>
<a id='line_827'>8:11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his</a>
<a id='line_828'>commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command</a>
<a id='line_829'>thee this day: 8:12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast</a>
<a id='line_830'>built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 8:13 And when thy herds and</a>
<a id='line_831'>thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and</a>
<a id='line_832'>all that thou hast is multiplied; 8:14 Then thine heart be lifted up,</a>
<a id='line_833'>and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the</a>
<a id='line_834'>land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 8:15 Who led thee through</a>
<a id='line_835'>that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and</a>
<a id='line_836'>scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee</a>
<a id='line_837'>forth water out of the rock of flint; 8:16 Who fed thee in the</a>
<a id='line_838'>wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might</a>
<a id='line_839'>humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy</a>
<a id='line_840'>latter end; 8:17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might</a>
<a id='line_841'>of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>8:18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that</a>
<a id='line_844'>giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant</a>
<a id='line_845'>which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>8:19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and</a>
<a id='line_848'>walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify</a>
<a id='line_849'>against you this day that ye shall surely perish.</a>
<a id='line_850'></a>
<a id='line_851'>8:20 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so</a>
<a id='line_852'>shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of</a>
<a id='line_853'>the LORD your God.</a>
<a id='line_854'></a>
<a id='line_855'>9:1 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to</a>
<a id='line_856'>possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and</a>
<a id='line_857'>fenced up to heaven, 9:2 A people great and tall, the children of the</a>
<a id='line_858'>Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can</a>
<a id='line_859'>stand before the children of Anak!  9:3 Understand therefore this day,</a>
<a id='line_860'>that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a</a>
<a id='line_861'>consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down</a>
<a id='line_862'>before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them</a>
<a id='line_863'>quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_864'></a>
<a id='line_865'>9:4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath</a>
<a id='line_866'>cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD</a>
<a id='line_867'>hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of</a>
<a id='line_868'>these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</a>
<a id='line_869'></a>
<a id='line_870'>9:5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,</a>
<a id='line_871'>dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these</a>
<a id='line_872'>nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and</a>
<a id='line_873'>that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,</a>
<a id='line_874'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_875'></a>
<a id='line_876'>9:6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this</a>
<a id='line_877'>good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a</a>
<a id='line_878'>stiffnecked people.</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>9:7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to</a>
<a id='line_881'>wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of</a>
<a id='line_882'>the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been</a>
<a id='line_883'>rebellious against the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_884'></a>
<a id='line_885'>9:8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was</a>
<a id='line_886'>angry with you to have destroyed you.</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,</a>
<a id='line_889'>even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I</a>
<a id='line_890'>abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat</a>
<a id='line_891'>bread nor drink water: 9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables</a>
<a id='line_892'>of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written</a>
<a id='line_893'>according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount</a>
<a id='line_894'>out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</a>
<a id='line_895'></a>
<a id='line_896'>9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,</a>
<a id='line_897'>that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the</a>
<a id='line_898'>covenant.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>9:12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from</a>
<a id='line_901'>hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have</a>
<a id='line_902'>corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way</a>
<a id='line_903'>which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</a>
<a id='line_904'></a>
<a id='line_905'>9:13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this</a>
<a id='line_906'>people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 9:14 Let me alone,</a>
<a id='line_907'>that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:</a>
<a id='line_908'>and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</a>
<a id='line_909'></a>
<a id='line_910'>9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned</a>
<a id='line_911'>with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</a>
<a id='line_912'></a>
<a id='line_913'>9:16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_914'>God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out</a>
<a id='line_915'>of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</a>
<a id='line_916'></a>
<a id='line_917'>9:17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and</a>
<a id='line_918'>brake them before your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>9:18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and</a>
<a id='line_921'>forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all</a>
<a id='line_922'>your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_923'>to provoke him to anger.</a>
<a id='line_924'></a>
<a id='line_925'>9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the</a>
<a id='line_926'>LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto</a>
<a id='line_927'>me at that time also.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>9:20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and</a>
<a id='line_930'>I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</a>
<a id='line_931'></a>
<a id='line_932'>9:21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it</a>
<a id='line_933'>with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was</a>
<a id='line_934'>as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that</a>
<a id='line_935'>descended out of the mount.</a>
<a id='line_936'></a>
<a id='line_937'>9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye</a>
<a id='line_938'>provoked the LORD to wrath.</a>
<a id='line_939'></a>
<a id='line_940'>9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up</a>
<a id='line_941'>and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against</a>
<a id='line_942'>the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor</a>
<a id='line_943'>hearkened to his voice.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>9:24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew</a>
<a id='line_946'>you.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>9:25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as</a>
<a id='line_949'>I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy</a>
<a id='line_950'>you.</a>
<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>9:26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy</a>
<a id='line_953'>not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through</a>
<a id='line_954'>thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a</a>
<a id='line_955'>mighty hand.</a>
<a id='line_956'></a>
<a id='line_957'>9:27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto</a>
<a id='line_958'>the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their</a>
<a id='line_959'>sin: 9:28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the</a>
<a id='line_960'>LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,</a>
<a id='line_961'>and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in</a>
<a id='line_962'>the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>9:29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou</a>
<a id='line_965'>broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone</a>
<a id='line_968'>like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee</a>
<a id='line_969'>an ark of wood.</a>
<a id='line_970'></a>
<a id='line_971'>10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first</a>
<a id='line_972'>tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.</a>
<a id='line_973'></a>
<a id='line_974'>10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone</a>
<a id='line_975'>like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables</a>
<a id='line_976'>in mine hand.</a>
<a id='line_977'></a>
<a id='line_978'>10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the</a>
<a id='line_979'>ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of</a>
<a id='line_980'>the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave</a>
<a id='line_981'>them unto me.</a>
<a id='line_982'></a>
<a id='line_983'>10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the</a>
<a id='line_984'>tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD</a>
<a id='line_985'>commanded me.</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>10:6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the</a>
<a id='line_988'>children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was</a>
<a id='line_989'>buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his</a>
<a id='line_990'>stead.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to</a>
<a id='line_993'>Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.</a>
<a id='line_994'></a>
<a id='line_995'>10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the</a>
<a id='line_996'>ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister</a>
<a id='line_997'>unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_998'></a>
<a id='line_999'>10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;</a>
<a id='line_1000'>the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised</a>
<a id='line_1001'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1002'></a>
<a id='line_1003'>10:10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty</a>
<a id='line_1004'>days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time</a>
<a id='line_1005'>also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.</a>
<a id='line_1006'></a>
<a id='line_1007'>10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the</a>
<a id='line_1008'>people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto</a>
<a id='line_1009'>their fathers to give unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1010'></a>
<a id='line_1011'>10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but</a>
<a id='line_1012'>to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy</a>
<a id='line_1014'>soul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>which I command thee this day for thy good?  10:14 Behold, the heaven</a>
<a id='line_1016'>and the heaven of heavens is the LORD’s thy God, the earth also, with</a>
<a id='line_1017'>all that therein is.</a>
<a id='line_1018'></a>
<a id='line_1019'>10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he</a>
<a id='line_1020'>chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this</a>
<a id='line_1021'>day.</a>
<a id='line_1022'></a>
<a id='line_1023'>10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more</a>
<a id='line_1024'>stiffnecked.</a>
<a id='line_1025'></a>
<a id='line_1026'>10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great</a>
<a id='line_1027'>God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh</a>
<a id='line_1028'>reward: 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and</a>
<a id='line_1029'>widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>10:19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the</a>
<a id='line_1032'>land of Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1033'></a>
<a id='line_1034'>10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to</a>
<a id='line_1035'>him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.</a>
<a id='line_1036'></a>
<a id='line_1037'>10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee</a>
<a id='line_1038'>these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten</a>
<a id='line_1041'>persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of</a>
<a id='line_1042'>heaven for multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which</a>
<a id='line_1048'>have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1049'>your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_1051'>Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 11:4 And</a>
<a id='line_1052'>what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their</a>
<a id='line_1053'>chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as</a>
<a id='line_1054'>they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this</a>
<a id='line_1055'>day; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came</a>
<a id='line_1056'>into this place; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons</a>
<a id='line_1057'>of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and</a>
<a id='line_1058'>swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the</a>
<a id='line_1059'>substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:</a>
<a id='line_1060'>11:7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he</a>
<a id='line_1061'>did.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>11:8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you</a>
<a id='line_1064'>this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>whither ye go to possess it; 11:9 And that ye may prolong your days in</a>
<a id='line_1066'>the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and</a>
<a id='line_1067'>to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</a>
<a id='line_1068'></a>
<a id='line_1069'>11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the</a>
<a id='line_1070'>land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11:11 But the</a>
<a id='line_1072'>land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and</a>
<a id='line_1073'>drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 11:12 A land which the LORD thy</a>
<a id='line_1074'>God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from</a>
<a id='line_1075'>the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.</a>
<a id='line_1076'></a>
<a id='line_1077'>11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto</a>
<a id='line_1078'>my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_1079'>God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</a>
<a id='line_1080'>11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,</a>
<a id='line_1081'>the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy</a>
<a id='line_1082'>corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</a>
<a id='line_1083'></a>
<a id='line_1084'>11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1085'>mayest eat and be full.</a>
<a id='line_1086'></a>
<a id='line_1087'>11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye</a>
<a id='line_1088'>turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 11:17 And then the</a>
<a id='line_1089'>LORD’s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that</a>
<a id='line_1090'>there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye</a>
<a id='line_1091'>perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in</a>
<a id='line_1094'>your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be</a>
<a id='line_1095'>as frontlets between your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>11:19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when</a>
<a id='line_1098'>thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when</a>
<a id='line_1099'>thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</a>
<a id='line_1100'></a>
<a id='line_1101'>11:20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>and upon thy gates: 11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and the</a>
<a id='line_1103'>days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your</a>
<a id='line_1104'>fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1105'></a>
<a id='line_1106'>11:22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I</a>
<a id='line_1107'>command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his</a>
<a id='line_1108'>ways, and to cleave unto him; 11:23 Then will the LORD drive out all</a>
<a id='line_1109'>these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations</a>
<a id='line_1110'>and mightier than yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be</a>
<a id='line_1113'>yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river</a>
<a id='line_1114'>Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.</a>
<a id='line_1115'></a>
<a id='line_1116'>11:25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1117'>your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the</a>
<a id='line_1118'>land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27</a>
<a id='line_1121'>A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I</a>
<a id='line_1122'>command you this day: 11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the</a>
<a id='line_1123'>commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which</a>
<a id='line_1124'>I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not</a>
<a id='line_1125'>known.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought</a>
<a id='line_1128'>thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1129'>shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount</a>

<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>11:30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun</a>

<a id='line_1135'>ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1136'>your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.</a>
<a id='line_1137'></a>
<a id='line_1138'>11:32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which</a>

<a id='line_1145'>12:2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations</a>

<a id='line_1148'>overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves</a>
<a id='line_1149'>with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and</a>

<a id='line_2570'>28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy</a>

<a id='line_2575'>the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he</a>
<a id='line_2576'>shall leave: 28:55 So that he will not give to any of them of the</a>
<a id='line_2577'>flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left</a>
<a id='line_2578'>him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall</a>

<a id='line_2580'></a>
<a id='line_2581'>28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not</a>

<a id='line_2593'>plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,</a>
<a id='line_2594'>and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</a>

<a id='line_2596'>28:60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,</a>

<a id='line_2607'>28:63 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to</a>

<a id='line_2612'>28:64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one</a>

<a id='line_2620'>thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and</a>
<a id='line_2621'>night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 28:67 In the morning</a>
<a id='line_2622'>thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say,</a>
<a id='line_2623'>Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou</a>

<a id='line_2638'>great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those</a>
<a id='line_2639'>great miracles: 29:4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to</a>

<a id='line_2689'>of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that</a>
<a id='line_2690'>shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of</a>
<a id='line_2691'>that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 29:23</a>
<a id='line_2692'>And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like</a>
<a id='line_2694'>the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the</a>
<a id='line_2695'>LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 29:24 Even all nations</a>
<a id='line_2696'>shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what</a>
<a id='line_2697'>meaneth the heat of this great anger?  29:25 Then men shall say,</a>
<a id='line_2698'>Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their</a>
<a id='line_2699'>fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the</a>
<a id='line_2700'>land of Egypt: 29:26 For they went and served other gods, and</a>
<a id='line_2701'>worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given</a>
<a id='line_2702'>unto them: 29:27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this</a>
<a id='line_2703'>land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:</a>
<a id='line_2704'>29:28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in</a>
<a id='line_2705'>wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as</a>
<a id='line_2706'>it is this day.</a>
<a id='line_2707'></a>
<a id='line_2708'>29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things</a>
<a id='line_2709'>which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that</a>

<a id='line_2711'></a>
<a id='line_2712'>30:1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon</a>

<a id='line_2715'>thy God hath driven thee, 30:2 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God,</a>
<a id='line_2716'>and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this</a>
<a id='line_2717'>day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy</a>
<a id='line_2718'>soul; 30:3 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and</a>
<a id='line_2719'>have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all</a>

<a id='line_2722'>30:4 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_2723'>from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he</a>

<a id='line_2741'>rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 30:10 If</a>
<a id='line_2742'>thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his</a>
<a id='line_2743'>commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the</a>

<a id='line_2747'>30:11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not</a>

<a id='line_2753'>shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear</a>
<a id='line_2754'>it, and do it?  30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy</a>

<a id='line_2798'></a>
<a id='line_2799'>31:7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of</a>

<a id='line_2807'></a>
<a id='line_2808'>31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the</a>

<a id='line_2811'></a>
<a id='line_2812'>31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven</a>
<a id='line_2813'>years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of</a>
<a id='line_2814'>tabernacles, 31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2815'>thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law</a>
<a id='line_2816'>before all Israel in their hearing.</a>
<a id='line_2817'></a>
<a id='line_2818'>31:12 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy</a>

<a id='line_2820'>may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words</a>
<a id='line_2821'>of this law: 31:13 And that their children, which have not known any</a>
<a id='line_2822'>thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye</a>
<a id='line_2823'>live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</a>
<a id='line_2824'></a>
<a id='line_2825'>31:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that</a>
<a id='line_2826'>thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle</a>
<a id='line_2827'>of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and</a>
<a id='line_2828'>Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_2829'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_2830'></a>
<a id='line_2831'>31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:</a>

<a id='line_2833'></a>
<a id='line_2834'>31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy</a>
<a id='line_2835'>fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods</a>
<a id='line_2836'>of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and</a>
<a id='line_2837'>will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</a>
<a id='line_2838'></a>
<a id='line_2839'>31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I</a>
<a id='line_2840'>will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_2841'>be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that</a>
<a id='line_2842'>they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because</a>
<a id='line_2843'>our God is not among us?  31:18 And I will surely hide my face in that</a>
<a id='line_2844'>day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are</a>
<a id='line_2845'>turned unto other gods.</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'>31:19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the</a>
<a id='line_2848'>children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a</a>
<a id='line_2849'>witness for me against the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2850'></a>
<a id='line_2851'>31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware</a>
<a id='line_2852'>unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall</a>
<a id='line_2853'>have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn</a>
<a id='line_2854'>unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my</a>
<a id='line_2855'>covenant.</a>
<a id='line_2856'></a>
<a id='line_2857'>31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are</a>
<a id='line_2858'>befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;</a>
<a id='line_2859'>for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I</a>
<a id='line_2860'>know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have</a>
<a id='line_2861'>brought them into the land which I sware.</a>
<a id='line_2862'></a>
<a id='line_2863'>31:22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the</a>
<a id='line_2864'>children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2865'></a>
<a id='line_2866'>31:23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong</a>
<a id='line_2867'>and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2868'>into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2869'></a>
<a id='line_2870'>31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the</a>
<a id='line_2871'>words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 31:25 That</a>
<a id='line_2872'>Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the</a>
<a id='line_2873'>LORD, saying, 31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side</a>
<a id='line_2874'>of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there</a>
<a id='line_2875'>for a witness against thee.</a>
<a id='line_2876'></a>
<a id='line_2877'>31:27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am</a>
<a id='line_2878'>yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_2879'>and how much more after my death?  31:28 Gather unto me all the elders</a>
<a id='line_2880'>of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in</a>
<a id='line_2881'>their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</a>
<a id='line_2882'></a>
<a id='line_2883'>31:29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt</a>
<a id='line_2884'>yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;</a>
<a id='line_2885'>and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil</a>
<a id='line_2886'>in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of</a>
<a id='line_2887'>your hands.</a>
<a id='line_2888'></a>
<a id='line_2889'>31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2890'>the words of this song, until they were ended.</a>
<a id='line_2891'></a>
<a id='line_2892'>32:1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the</a>
<a id='line_2893'>words of my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2894'></a>
<a id='line_2895'>32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the</a>
<a id='line_2896'>dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon</a>
<a id='line_2897'>the grass: 32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe</a>
<a id='line_2898'>ye greatness unto our God.</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>
<a id='line_2900'>32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are</a>

<a id='line_2903'>32:5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his</a>
<a id='line_2904'>children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</a>
<a id='line_2905'></a>

<a id='line_2907'>he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2908'>established thee?  32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the years</a>
<a id='line_2909'>of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy</a>

<a id='line_2912'>32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when</a>
<a id='line_2913'>he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people</a>

<a id='line_2915'></a>
<a id='line_2916'>32:9 For the LORD’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his</a>

<a id='line_2919'>32:10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling</a>
<a id='line_2920'>wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the</a>

<a id='line_2922'></a>
<a id='line_2923'>32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,</a>

<a id='line_2926'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_2927'></a>
<a id='line_2928'>32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might</a>
<a id='line_2929'>eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of</a>
<a id='line_2930'>the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 32:14 Butter of kine, and</a>
<a id='line_2931'>milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and</a>
<a id='line_2932'>goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure</a>
<a id='line_2933'>blood of the grape.</a>
<a id='line_2934'></a>
<a id='line_2935'>32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art</a>
<a id='line_2936'>grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which</a>
<a id='line_2937'>made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</a>
<a id='line_2938'></a>
<a id='line_2939'>32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with</a>
<a id='line_2940'>abominations provoked they him to anger.</a>
<a id='line_2941'></a>
<a id='line_2942'>32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew</a>
<a id='line_2943'>not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</a>
<a id='line_2944'></a>
<a id='line_2945'>32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast</a>

<a id='line_2949'>provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</a>
<a id='line_2950'></a>
<a id='line_2951'>32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what</a>
<a id='line_2952'>their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children</a>

<a id='line_2954'></a>
<a id='line_2955'>32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they</a>

<a id='line_2958'>anger with a foolish nation.</a>
<a id='line_2959'></a>
<a id='line_2960'>32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the</a>

<a id='line_2962'>fire the foundations of the mountains.</a>
<a id='line_2963'></a>
<a id='line_2964'>32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon</a>

<a id='line_2968'>and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon</a>

<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>32:25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the</a>

<a id='line_2974'></a>
<a id='line_2975'>32:26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the</a>
<a id='line_2976'>remembrance of them to cease from among men: 32:27 Were it not that I</a>
<a id='line_2977'>feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave</a>
<a id='line_2978'>themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and</a>

<a id='line_2980'></a>
<a id='line_2981'>32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any</a>
<a id='line_2982'>understanding in them.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>32:29 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they</a>
<a id='line_2985'>would consider their latter end!  32:30 How should one chase a</a>
<a id='line_2986'>thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had</a>
<a id='line_2987'>sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  32:31 For their rock is not</a>
<a id='line_2988'>as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</a>
<a id='line_2989'></a>
<a id='line_2990'>32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of</a>
<a id='line_2991'>Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</a>
<a id='line_2992'>32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of</a>
<a id='line_2993'>asps.</a>
<a id='line_2994'></a>
<a id='line_2995'>32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my</a>
<a id='line_2996'>treasures?  32:35 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot</a>
<a id='line_2997'>shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and</a>
<a id='line_2998'>the things that shall come upon them make haste.</a>
<a id='line_2999'></a>
<a id='line_3000'>32:36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his</a>
<a id='line_3001'>servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none</a>
<a id='line_3002'>shut up, or left.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>32:37 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they</a>
<a id='line_3005'>trusted, 32:38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank</a>
<a id='line_3006'>the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and</a>
<a id='line_3007'>be your protection.</a>
<a id='line_3008'></a>
<a id='line_3009'>32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I</a>
<a id='line_3010'>kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that</a>
<a id='line_3011'>can deliver out of my hand.</a>
<a id='line_3012'></a>
<a id='line_3013'>32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</a>
<a id='line_3014'></a>
<a id='line_3015'>32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on</a>
<a id='line_3016'>judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward</a>
<a id='line_3017'>them that hate me.</a>
<a id='line_3018'></a>
<a id='line_3019'>32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall</a>
<a id='line_3020'>devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the</a>
<a id='line_3021'>captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_3022'></a>
<a id='line_3023'>32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the</a>
<a id='line_3024'>blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,</a>
<a id='line_3025'>and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</a>
<a id='line_3026'></a>
<a id='line_3027'>32:44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears</a>
<a id='line_3028'>of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'>32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</a>
<a id='line_3031'>32:46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which</a>
<a id='line_3032'>I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to</a>
<a id='line_3033'>observe to do, all the words of this law.</a>
<a id='line_3034'></a>
<a id='line_3035'>32:47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and</a>
<a id='line_3036'>through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye</a>
<a id='line_3037'>go over Jordan to possess it.</a>
<a id='line_3038'></a>
<a id='line_3039'>32:48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 32:49</a>
<a id='line_3040'>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in</a>
<a id='line_3041'>the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of</a>
<a id='line_3042'>Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</a>
<a id='line_3043'>32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto</a>
<a id='line_3044'>thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered</a>
<a id='line_3045'>unto his people: 32:51 Because ye trespassed against me among the</a>
<a id='line_3046'>children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness</a>
<a id='line_3047'>of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of</a>
<a id='line_3048'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3049'></a>
<a id='line_3050'>32:52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go</a>
<a id='line_3051'>thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3052'></a>
<a id='line_3053'>33:1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed</a>
<a id='line_3054'>the children of Israel before his death.</a>
<a id='line_3055'></a>
<a id='line_3056'>33:2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto</a>
<a id='line_3057'>them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands</a>
<a id='line_3058'>of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.</a>
<a id='line_3059'></a>
<a id='line_3060'>33:3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and</a>
<a id='line_3061'>they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.</a>
<a id='line_3062'></a>
<a id='line_3063'>33:4 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the</a>
<a id='line_3064'>congregation of Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_3065'></a>
<a id='line_3066'>33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the</a>
<a id='line_3067'>tribes of Israel were gathered together.</a>
<a id='line_3068'></a>
<a id='line_3069'>33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.</a>
<a id='line_3070'></a>
<a id='line_3071'>33:7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the</a>
<a id='line_3072'>voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be</a>
<a id='line_3073'>sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_3074'></a>
<a id='line_3075'>33:8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy</a>
<a id='line_3076'>holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst</a>
<a id='line_3077'>strive at the waters of Meribah; 33:9 Who said unto his father and to</a>
<a id='line_3078'>his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his</a>
<a id='line_3079'>brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word,</a>
<a id='line_3080'>and kept thy covenant.</a>
<a id='line_3081'></a>
<a id='line_3082'>33:10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they</a>
<a id='line_3083'>shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine</a>
<a id='line_3084'>altar.</a>
<a id='line_3085'></a>
<a id='line_3086'>33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;</a>
<a id='line_3087'>smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them</a>
<a id='line_3088'>that hate him, that they rise not again.</a>
<a id='line_3089'></a>
<a id='line_3090'>33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in</a>
<a id='line_3091'>safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he</a>
<a id='line_3092'>shall dwell between his shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_3093'></a>
<a id='line_3094'>33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the</a>
<a id='line_3095'>precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth</a>
<a id='line_3096'>beneath, 33:14 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,</a>
<a id='line_3097'>and for the precious things put forth by the moon, 33:15 And for the</a>
<a id='line_3098'>chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of</a>
<a id='line_3099'>the lasting hills, 33:16 And for the precious things of the earth and</a>
<a id='line_3100'>fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:</a>
<a id='line_3101'>let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the</a>
<a id='line_3102'>head of him that was separated from his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>33:17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns</a>
<a id='line_3105'>are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people</a>
<a id='line_3106'>together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of</a>
<a id='line_3107'>Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.</a>
<a id='line_3108'></a>
<a id='line_3109'>33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,</a>
<a id='line_3110'>Issachar, in thy tents.</a>
<a id='line_3111'></a>
<a id='line_3112'>33:19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall</a>
<a id='line_3113'>offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the</a>
<a id='line_3114'>abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.</a>
<a id='line_3115'></a>
<a id='line_3116'>33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he</a>
<a id='line_3117'>dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.</a>
<a id='line_3118'></a>
<a id='line_3119'>33:21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a</a>
<a id='line_3120'>portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of</a>
<a id='line_3121'>the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments</a>
<a id='line_3122'>with Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3123'></a>
<a id='line_3124'>33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from</a>
<a id='line_3125'>Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_3126'></a>
<a id='line_3127'>33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and</a>
<a id='line_3128'>full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the</a>
<a id='line_3129'>south.</a>
<a id='line_3130'></a>
<a id='line_3131'>33:24 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let</a>
<a id='line_3132'>him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</a>
<a id='line_3133'></a>
<a id='line_3134'>33:25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy</a>
<a id='line_3135'>strength be.</a>
<a id='line_3136'></a>
<a id='line_3137'>33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the</a>
<a id='line_3138'>heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.</a>
<a id='line_3139'></a>
<a id='line_3140'>33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the</a>
<a id='line_3141'>everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;</a>
<a id='line_3142'>and shall say, Destroy them.</a>
<a id='line_3143'></a>
<a id='line_3144'>33:28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob</a>
<a id='line_3145'>shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop</a>
<a id='line_3146'>down dew.</a>
<a id='line_3147'></a>
<a id='line_3148'>33:29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved</a>
<a id='line_3149'>by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy</a>
<a id='line_3150'>excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou</a>
<a id='line_3151'>shalt tread upon their high places.</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>34:1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of</a>
<a id='line_3154'>Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD</a>
<a id='line_3155'>shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 34:2 And all Naphtali,</a>
<a id='line_3156'>and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto</a>
<a id='line_3157'>the utmost sea, 34:3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of</a>
<a id='line_3158'>Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</a>
<a id='line_3159'></a>
<a id='line_3160'>34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto</a>
<a id='line_3161'>Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy</a>
<a id='line_3162'>seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_3163'>go over thither.</a>
<a id='line_3164'></a>
<a id='line_3165'>34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,</a>
<a id='line_3166'>according to the word of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3167'></a>
<a id='line_3168'>34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against</a>
<a id='line_3169'>Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_3170'></a>
<a id='line_3171'>34:7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his</a>
<a id='line_3172'>eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</a>
<a id='line_3173'></a>
<a id='line_3174'>34:8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab</a>
<a id='line_3175'>thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.</a>
<a id='line_3176'></a>
<a id='line_3177'>34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for</a>
<a id='line_3178'>Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_3179'>hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3180'></a>
<a id='line_3181'>34:10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,</a>
<a id='line_3182'>whom the LORD knew face to face, 34:11 In all the signs and the</a>
<a id='line_3183'>wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to</a>
<a id='line_3184'>Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 34:12 And in</a>
<a id='line_3185'>all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed</a>
<a id='line_3186'>in the sight of all Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
