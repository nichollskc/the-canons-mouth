<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      The loss of Constantinople restored a momentary vigor to the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Greeks. From their palaces, the princes and nobles were driven</a>
<a id='line_10'>      into the field; and the fragments of the falling monarchy were</a>
<a id='line_11'>      grasped by the hands of the most vigorous or the most skilful</a>
<a id='line_12'>      candidates. In the long and barren pages of the Byzantine annals,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      1 it would not be an easy task to equal the two characters of</a>
<a id='line_14'>      Theodore Lascaris and John Ducas Vataces, 2 who replanted and</a>
<a id='line_15'>      upheld the Roman standard at Nice in Bithynia. The difference of</a>
<a id='line_16'>      their virtues was happily suited to the diversity of their</a>
<a id='line_17'>      situation. In his first efforts, the fugitive Lascaris commanded</a>
<a id='line_18'>      only three cities and two thousand soldiers: his reign was the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      season of generous and active despair: in every military</a>
<a id='line_20'>      operation he staked his life and crown; and his enemies of the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Hellespont and the Mæander, were surprised by his celerity and</a>
<a id='line_22'>      subdued by his boldness. A victorious reign of eighteen years</a>
<a id='line_23'>      expanded the principality of Nice to the magnitude of an empire.</a>
<a id='line_24'>      The throne of his successor and son-in-law Vataces was founded on</a>
<a id='line_25'>      a more solid basis, a larger scope, and more plentiful resources;</a>
<a id='line_26'>      and it was the temper, as well as the interest, of Vataces to</a>
<a id='line_27'>      calculate the risk, to expect the moment, and to insure the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      success, of his ambitious designs. In the decline of the Latins,</a>
<a id='line_29'>      I have briefly exposed the progress of the Greeks; the prudent</a>
<a id='line_30'>      and gradual advances of a conqueror, who, in a reign of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      thirty-three years, rescued the provinces from national and</a>
<a id='line_32'>      foreign usurpers, till he pressed on all sides the Imperial city,</a>
<a id='line_33'>      a leafless and sapless trunk, which must full at the first stroke</a>
<a id='line_34'>      of the axe. But his interior and peaceful administration is still</a>
<a id='line_35'>      more deserving of notice and praise. 3 The calamities of the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      times had wasted the numbers and the substance of the Greeks; the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      motives and the means of agriculture were extirpated; and the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      most fertile lands were left without cultivation or inhabitants.</a>
<a id='line_39'>      A portion of this vacant property was occupied and improved by</a>
<a id='line_40'>      the command, and for the benefit, of the emperor: a powerful hand</a>
<a id='line_41'>      and a vigilant eye supplied and surpassed, by a skilful</a>
<a id='line_42'>      management, the minute diligence of a private farmer: the royal</a>
<a id='line_43'>      domain became the garden and granary of Asia; and without</a>
<a id='line_44'>      impoverishing the people, the sovereign acquired a fund of</a>
<a id='line_45'>      innocent and productive wealth. According to the nature of the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      soil, his lands were sown with corn or planted with vines; the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      pastures were filled with horses and oxen, with sheep and hogs;</a>
<a id='line_48'>      and when Vataces presented to the empress a crown of diamonds and</a>
<a id='line_49'>      pearls, he informed her, with a smile, that this precious</a>
<a id='line_50'>      ornament arose from the sale of the eggs of his innumerable</a>
<a id='line_51'>      poultry. The produce of his domain was applied to the maintenance</a>
<a id='line_52'>      of his palace and hospitals, the calls of dignity and</a>
<a id='line_53'>      benevolence: the lesson was still more useful than the revenue:</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the plough was restored to its ancient security and honor; and</a>
<a id='line_55'>      the nobles were taught to seek a sure and independent revenue</a>
<a id='line_56'>      from their estates, instead of adorning their splendid beggary by</a>
<a id='line_57'>      the oppression of the people, or (what is almost the same) by the</a>
<a id='line_58'>      favors of the court. The superfluous stock of corn and cattle was</a>
<a id='line_59'>      eagerly purchased by the Turks, with whom Vataces preserved a</a>
<a id='line_60'>      strict and sincere alliance; but he discouraged the importation</a>
<a id='line_61'>      of foreign manufactures, the costly silks of the East, and the</a>
<a id='line_62'>      curious labors of the Italian looms. “The demands of nature and</a>
<a id='line_63'>      necessity,” was he accustomed to say, “are indispensable; but the</a>
<a id='line_64'>      influence of fashion may rise and sink at the breath of a</a>
<a id='line_65'>      monarch;” and both his precept and example recommended simplicity</a>
<a id='line_66'>      of manners and the use of domestic industry. The education of</a>
<a id='line_67'>      youth and the revival of learning were the most serious objects</a>
<a id='line_68'>      of his care; and, without deciding the precedency, he pronounced</a>
<a id='line_69'>      with truth, that a prince and a philosopher 4 are the two most</a>
<a id='line_70'>      eminent characters of human society. His first wife was Irene,</a>
<a id='line_71'>      the daughter of Theodore Lascaris, a woman more illustrious by</a>
<a id='line_72'>      her personal merit, the milder virtues of her sex, than by the</a>
<a id='line_73'>      blood of the Angeli and Comneni that flowed in her veins, and</a>
<a id='line_74'>      transmitted the inheritance of the empire. After her death he was</a>
<a id='line_75'>      contracted to Anne, or Constance, a natural daughter of the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      emperor Frederic 499 the Second; but as the bride had not</a>
<a id='line_77'>      attained the years of puberty, Vataces placed in his solitary bed</a>
<a id='line_78'>      an Italian damsel of her train; and his amorous weakness bestowed</a>
<a id='line_79'>      on the concubine the honors, though not the title, of a lawful</a>
<a id='line_80'>      empress. His frailty was censured as a flagitious and damnable</a>
<a id='line_81'>      sin by the monks; and their rude invectives exercised and</a>
<a id='line_82'>      displayed the patience of the royal lover. A philosophic age may</a>
<a id='line_83'>      excuse a single vice, which was redeemed by a crowd of virtues;</a>
<a id='line_84'>      and in the review of his faults, and the more intemperate</a>
<a id='line_85'>      passions of Lascaris, the judgment of their contemporaries was</a>
<a id='line_86'>      softened by gratitude to the second founders of the empire. 5 The</a>
<a id='line_87'>      slaves of the Latins, without law or peace, applauded the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      happiness of their brethren who had resumed their national</a>
<a id='line_89'>      freedom; and Vataces employed the laudable policy of convincing</a>
<a id='line_90'>      the Greeks of every dominion that it was their interest to be</a>
<a id='line_91'>      enrolled in the number of his subjects.</a>

<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>      A strong shade of degeneracy is visible between John Vataces and</a>
<a id='line_122'>      his son Theodore; between the founder who sustained the weight,</a>
<a id='line_123'>      and the heir who enjoyed the splendor, of the Imperial crown. 6</a>
<a id='line_124'>      Yet the character of Theodore was not devoid of energy; he had</a>
<a id='line_125'>      been educated in the school of his father, in the exercise of war</a>
<a id='line_126'>      and hunting; Constantinople was yet spared; but in the three</a>
<a id='line_127'>      years of a short reign, he thrice led his armies into the heart</a>
<a id='line_128'>      of Bulgaria. His virtues were sullied by a choleric and</a>
<a id='line_129'>      suspicious temper: the first of these may be ascribed to the</a>
<a id='line_130'>      ignorance of control; and the second might naturally arise from a</a>
<a id='line_131'>      dark and imperfect view of the corruption of mankind. On a march</a>
<a id='line_132'>      in Bulgaria, he consulted on a question of policy his principal</a>
<a id='line_133'>      ministers; and the Greek logothete, George Acropolita, presumed</a>
<a id='line_134'>      to offend him by the declaration of a free and honest opinion.</a>
<a id='line_135'>      The emperor half unsheathed his cimeter; but his more deliberate</a>
<a id='line_136'>      rage reserved Acropolita for a baser punishment. One of the first</a>
<a id='line_137'>      officers of the empire was ordered to dismount, stripped of his</a>
<a id='line_138'>      robes, and extended on the ground in the presence of the prince</a>
<a id='line_139'>      and army. In this posture he was chastised with so many and such</a>
<a id='line_140'>      heavy blows from the clubs of two guards or executioners, that</a>
<a id='line_141'>      when Theodore commanded them to cease, the great logothete was</a>
<a id='line_142'>      scarcely able to rise and crawl away to his tent. After a</a>
<a id='line_143'>      seclusion of some days, he was recalled by a peremptory mandate</a>
<a id='line_144'>      to his seat in council; and so dead were the Greeks to the sense</a>
<a id='line_145'>      of honor and shame, that it is from the narrative of the sufferer</a>
<a id='line_146'>      himself that we acquire the knowledge of his disgrace. 7 The</a>
<a id='line_147'>      cruelty of the emperor was exasperated by the pangs of sickness,</a>
<a id='line_148'>      the approach of a premature end, and the suspicion of poison and</a>
<a id='line_149'>      magic. The lives and fortunes, the eyes and limbs, of his kinsmen</a>
<a id='line_150'>      and nobles, were sacrificed to each sally of passion; and before</a>
<a id='line_151'>      he died, the son of Vataces might deserve from the people, or at</a>
<a id='line_152'>      least from the court, the appellation of tyrant. A matron of the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      family of the Palæologi had provoked his anger by refusing to</a>
<a id='line_154'>      bestow her beauteous daughter on the vile plebeian who was</a>
<a id='line_155'>      recommended by his caprice. Without regard to her birth or age,</a>
<a id='line_156'>      her body, as high as the neck, was enclosed in a sack with</a>
<a id='line_157'>      several cats, who were pricked with pins to irritate their fury</a>
<a id='line_158'>      against their unfortunate fellow-captive. In his last hours the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      emperor testified a wish to forgive and be forgiven, a just</a>
<a id='line_160'>      anxiety for the fate of John his son and successor, who, at the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      age of eight years, was condemned to the dangers of a long</a>
<a id='line_162'>      minority. His last choice intrusted the office of guardian to the</a>
<a id='line_163'>      sanctity of the patriarch Arsenius, and to the courage of George</a>
<a id='line_164'>      Muzalon, the great domestic, who was equally distinguished by the</a>
<a id='line_165'>      royal favor and the public hatred. Since their connection with</a>
<a id='line_166'>      the Latins, the names and privileges of hereditary rank had</a>
<a id='line_167'>      insinuated themselves into the Greek monarchy; and the noble</a>
<a id='line_168'>      families 8 were provoked by the elevation of a worthless</a>
<a id='line_169'>      favorite, to whose influence they imputed the errors and</a>
<a id='line_170'>      calamities of the late reign. In the first council, after the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      emperor’s death, Muzalon, from a lofty throne, pronounced a</a>
<a id='line_172'>      labored apology of his conduct and intentions: his modesty was</a>
<a id='line_173'>      subdued by a unanimous assurance of esteem and fidelity; and his</a>
<a id='line_174'>      most inveterate enemies were the loudest to salute him as the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      guardian and savior of the Romans. Eight days were sufficient to</a>
<a id='line_176'>      prepare the execution of the conspiracy. On the ninth, the</a>
<a id='line_177'>      obsequies of the deceased monarch were solemnized in the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      cathedral of Magnesia, 9 an Asiatic city, where he expired, on</a>
<a id='line_179'>      the banks of the Hermus, and at the foot of Mount Sipylus. The</a>
<a id='line_180'>      holy rites were interrupted by a sedition of the guards; Muzalon,</a>
<a id='line_181'>      his brothers, and his adherents, were massacred at the foot of</a>
<a id='line_182'>      the altar; and the absent patriarch was associated with a new</a>
<a id='line_183'>      colleague, with Michael Palæologus, the most illustrious, in</a>
<a id='line_184'>      birth and merit, of the Greek nobles. 10</a>

<a id='line_222'>      the noble race of the Palæologi 11 stands high and conspicuous in</a>
<a id='line_223'>      the Byzantine history: it was the valiant George Palæologus who</a>

<a id='line_225'>      or descendants continue, in each generation, to lead the armies</a>

<a id='line_229'>      yielded to her elder sister, the mother of Michael Palæologus,</a>

<a id='line_231'>      the splendor of birth was dignified by the merit of the soldier</a>
<a id='line_232'>      and statesman: in his early youth he was promoted to the office</a>

<a id='line_234'>      private expense of a day never exceeded three pieces of gold; but</a>
<a id='line_235'>      his ambition was rapacious and profuse; and his gifts were</a>

<a id='line_240'>      of Justice and Vataces, a dispute arose 12 between two officers,</a>
<a id='line_241'>      one of whom accused the other of maintaining the hereditary right</a>
<a id='line_242'>      of the Palæologi The cause was decided, according to the new</a>
<a id='line_243'>      jurisprudence of the Latins, by single combat; the defendant was</a>
<a id='line_244'>      overthrown; but he persisted in declaring that himself alone was</a>
<a id='line_245'>      guilty; and that he had uttered these rash or treasonable</a>
<a id='line_246'>      speeches without the approbation or knowledge of his patron. Yet</a>
<a id='line_247'>      a cloud of suspicion hung over the innocence of the constable; he</a>
<a id='line_248'>      was still pursued by the whispers of malevolence; and a subtle</a>
<a id='line_249'>      courtier, the archbishop of Philadelphia, urged him to accept the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      judgment of God in the fiery proof of the ordeal. 13 Three days</a>
<a id='line_251'>      before the trial, the patient’s arm was enclosed in a bag, and</a>
<a id='line_252'>      secured by the royal signet; and it was incumbent on him to bear</a>
<a id='line_253'>      a red-hot ball of iron three times from the altar to the rails of</a>
<a id='line_254'>      the sanctuary, without artifice and without injury. Palæologus</a>
<a id='line_255'>      eluded the dangerous experiment with sense and pleasantry. “I am</a>
<a id='line_256'>      a soldier,” said he, “and will boldly enter the lists with my</a>
<a id='line_257'>      accusers; but a layman, a sinner like myself, is not endowed with</a>
<a id='line_258'>      the gift of miracles. _Your_ piety, most holy prelate, may</a>
<a id='line_259'>      deserve the interposition of Heaven, and from your hands I will</a>
<a id='line_260'>      receive the fiery globe, the pledge of my innocence.” The</a>
<a id='line_261'>      archbishop started; the emperor smiled; and the absolution or</a>
<a id='line_262'>      pardon of Michael was approved by new rewards and new services.</a>
<a id='line_263'>      II. In the succeeding reign, as he held the government of Nice,</a>
<a id='line_264'>      he was secretly informed, that the mind of the absent prince was</a>
<a id='line_265'>      poisoned with jealousy; and that death, or blindness, would be</a>
<a id='line_266'>      his final reward. Instead of awaiting the return and sentence of</a>
<a id='line_267'>      Theodore, the constable, with some followers, escaped from the</a>
<a id='line_268'>      city and the empire; and though he was plundered by the Turkmans</a>
<a id='line_269'>      of the desert, he found a hospitable refuge in the court of the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      sultan. In the ambiguous state of an exile, Michael reconciled</a>
<a id='line_271'>      the duties of gratitude and loyalty: drawing his sword against</a>
<a id='line_272'>      the Tartars; admonishing the garrisons of the Roman limit; and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      promoting, by his influence, the restoration of peace, in which</a>
<a id='line_274'>      his pardon and recall were honorably included. III. While he</a>
<a id='line_275'>      guarded the West against the despot of Epirus, Michael was again</a>
<a id='line_276'>      suspected and condemned in the palace; and such was his loyalty</a>
<a id='line_277'>      or weakness, that he submitted to be led in chains above six</a>
<a id='line_278'>      hundred miles from Durazzo to Nice. The civility of the messenger</a>
<a id='line_279'>      alleviated his disgrace; the emperor’s sickness dispelled his</a>
<a id='line_280'>      danger; and the last breath of Theodore, which recommended his</a>
<a id='line_281'>      infant son, at once acknowledged the innocence and the power of</a>

<a id='line_310'>      himself against each other, and forced every competitor to own,</a>
<a id='line_311'>      that after his own claims, those of Palæologus were best entitled</a>
<a id='line_312'>      to the preference. Under the title of great duke, he accepted or</a>
<a id='line_313'>      assumed, during a long minority, the active powers of government;</a>
<a id='line_314'>      the patriarch was a venerable name; and the factious nobles were</a>
<a id='line_315'>      seduced, or oppressed, by the ascendant of his genius. The fruits</a>
<a id='line_316'>      of the economy of Vataces were deposited in a strong castle on</a>
<a id='line_317'>      the banks of the Hermus, in the custody of the faithful</a>
<a id='line_318'>      Varangians: the constable retained his command or influence over</a>
<a id='line_319'>      the foreign troops; he employed the guards to possess the</a>
<a id='line_320'>      treasure, and the treasure to corrupt the guards; and whatsoever</a>
<a id='line_321'>      might be the abuse of the public money, his character was above</a>
<a id='line_322'>      the suspicion of private avarice. By himself, or by his</a>
<a id='line_323'>      emissaries, he strove to persuade every rank of subjects, that</a>
<a id='line_324'>      their own prosperity would rise in just proportion to the</a>
<a id='line_325'>      establishment of his authority. The weight of taxes was</a>
<a id='line_326'>      suspended, the perpetual theme of popular complaint; and he</a>
<a id='line_327'>      prohibited the trials by the ordeal and judicial combat. These</a>
<a id='line_328'>      Barbaric institutions were already abolished or undermined in</a>
<a id='line_329'>      France 15 and England; 16 and the appeal to the sword offended</a>
<a id='line_330'>      the sense of a civilized, 17 and the temper of an unwarlike,</a>
<a id='line_331'>      people. For the future maintenance of their wives and children,</a>
<a id='line_332'>      the veterans were grateful: the priests and the philosophers</a>
<a id='line_333'>      applauded his ardent zeal for the advancement of religion and</a>
<a id='line_334'>      learning; and his vague promise of rewarding merit was applied by</a>
<a id='line_335'>      every candidate to his own hopes. Conscious of the influence of</a>
<a id='line_336'>      the clergy, Michael successfully labored to secure the suffrage</a>
<a id='line_337'>      of that powerful order. Their expensive journey from Nice to</a>
<a id='line_338'>      Magnesia, afforded a decent and ample pretence: the leading</a>
<a id='line_339'>      prelates were tempted by the liberality of his nocturnal visits;</a>
<a id='line_340'>      and the incorruptible patriarch was flattered by the homage of</a>
<a id='line_341'>      his new colleague, who led his mule by the bridle into the town,</a>
<a id='line_342'>      and removed to a respectful distance the importunity of the</a>
<a id='line_343'>      crowd. Without renouncing his title by royal descent, Palæologus</a>
<a id='line_344'>      encouraged a free discussion into the advantages of elective</a>
<a id='line_345'>      monarchy; and his adherents asked, with the insolence of triumph,</a>
<a id='line_346'>      what patient would trust his health, or what merchant would</a>
<a id='line_347'>      abandon his vessel, to the _hereditary_ skill of a physician or a</a>
<a id='line_348'>      pilot? The youth of the emperor, and the impending dangers of a</a>
<a id='line_349'>      minority, required the support of a mature and experienced</a>
<a id='line_350'>      guardian; of an associate raised above the envy of his equals,</a>
<a id='line_351'>      and invested with the name and prerogatives of royalty. For the</a>
<a id='line_352'>      interest of the prince and people, without any selfish views for</a>
<a id='line_353'>      himself or his family, the great duke consented to guard and</a>
<a id='line_354'>      instruct the son of Theodore; but he sighed for the happy moment</a>
<a id='line_355'>      when he might restore to his firmer hands the administration of</a>
<a id='line_356'>      his patrimony, and enjoy the blessings of a private station. He</a>
<a id='line_357'>      was first invested with the title and prerogatives of _despot_,</a>
<a id='line_358'>      which bestowed the purple ornaments and the second place in the</a>
<a id='line_359'>      Roman monarchy. It was afterwards agreed that John and Michael</a>
<a id='line_360'>      should be proclaimed as joint emperors, and raised on the</a>
<a id='line_361'>      buckler, but that the preeminence should be reserved for the</a>
<a id='line_362'>      birthright of the former. A mutual league of amity was pledged</a>
<a id='line_363'>      between the royal partners; and in case of a rupture, the</a>
<a id='line_364'>      subjects were bound, by their oath of allegiance, to declare</a>
<a id='line_365'>      themselves against the aggressor; an ambiguous name, the seed of</a>
<a id='line_366'>      discord and civil war. Palæologus was content; but, on the day of</a>
<a id='line_367'>      the coronation, and in the cathedral of Nice, his zealous</a>
<a id='line_368'>      adherents most vehemently urged the just priority of his age and</a>
<a id='line_369'>      merit. The unseasonable dispute was eluded by postponing to a</a>
<a id='line_370'>      more convenient opportunity the coronation of John Lascaris; and</a>
<a id='line_371'>      he walked with a slight diadem in the train of his guardian, who</a>
<a id='line_372'>      alone received the Imperial crown from the hands of the</a>
<a id='line_373'>      patriarch. It was not without extreme reluctance that Arsenius</a>
<a id='line_374'>      abandoned the cause of his pupil; out the Varangians brandished</a>
<a id='line_375'>      their battle-axes; a sign of assent was extorted from the</a>
<a id='line_376'>      trembling youth; and some voices were heard, that the life of a</a>
<a id='line_377'>      child should no longer impede the settlement of the nation. A</a>
<a id='line_378'>      full harvest of honors and employments was distributed among his</a>
<a id='line_379'>      friends by the grateful Palæologus. In his own family he created</a>
<a id='line_380'>      a despot and two sebastocrators; Alexius Strategopulus was</a>
<a id='line_381'>      decorated with the title of Cæsar; and that veteran commander</a>
<a id='line_382'>      soon repaid the obligation, by restoring Constantinople to the</a>

<a id='line_430'>      which he had dropped in his precipitate flight. A general</a>
<a id='line_431'>      assembly of the bishops, senators, and nobles, was immediately</a>
<a id='line_432'>      convened, and never perhaps was an event received with more</a>
<a id='line_433'>      heartfelt and universal joy. In a studied oration, the new</a>
<a id='line_434'>      sovereign of Constantinople congratulated his own and the public</a>
<a id='line_435'>      fortune. “There was a time,” said he, “a far distant time, when</a>
<a id='line_436'>      the Roman empire extended to the Adriatic, the Tigris, and the</a>
<a id='line_437'>      confines of Æthiopia. After the loss of the provinces, our</a>
<a id='line_438'>      capital itself, in these last and calamitous days, has been</a>
<a id='line_439'>      wrested from our hands by the Barbarians of the West. From the</a>
<a id='line_440'>      lowest ebb, the tide of prosperity has again returned in our</a>
<a id='line_441'>      favor; but our prosperity was that of fugitives and exiles: and</a>
<a id='line_442'>      when we were asked, which was the country of the Romans, we</a>
<a id='line_443'>      indicated with a blush the climate of the globe, and the quarter</a>
<a id='line_444'>      of the heavens. The divine Providence has now restored to our</a>
<a id='line_445'>      arms the city of Constantine, the sacred seat of religion and</a>
<a id='line_446'>      empire; and it will depend on our valor and conduct to render</a>
<a id='line_447'>      this important acquisition the pledge and omen of future</a>
<a id='line_448'>      victories.” So eager was the impatience of the prince and people,</a>
<a id='line_449'>      that Michael made his triumphal entry into Constantinople only</a>
<a id='line_450'>      twenty days after the expulsion of the Latins. The golden gate</a>
<a id='line_451'>      was thrown open at his approach; the devout conqueror dismounted</a>
<a id='line_452'>      from his horse; and a miraculous image of Mary the Conductress</a>
<a id='line_453'>      was borne before him, that the divine Virgin in person might</a>
<a id='line_454'>      appear to conduct him to the temple of her Son, the cathedral of</a>
<a id='line_455'>      St. Sophia. But after the first transport of devotion and pride,</a>
<a id='line_456'>      he sighed at the dreary prospect of solitude and ruin. The palace</a>
<a id='line_457'>      was defiled with smoke and dirt, and the gross intemperance of</a>
<a id='line_458'>      the Franks; whole streets had been consumed by fire, or were</a>
<a id='line_459'>      decayed by the injuries of time; the sacred and profane edifices</a>
<a id='line_460'>      were stripped of their ornaments: and, as if they were conscious</a>
<a id='line_461'>      of their approaching exile, the industry of the Latins had been</a>
<a id='line_462'>      confined to the work of pillage and destruction. Trade had</a>
<a id='line_463'>      expired under the pressure of anarchy and distress, and the</a>
<a id='line_464'>      numbers of inhabitants had decreased with the opulence of the</a>
<a id='line_465'>      city. It was the first care of the Greek monarch to reinstate the</a>
<a id='line_466'>      nobles in the palaces of their fathers; and the houses or the</a>
<a id='line_467'>      ground which they occupied were restored to the families that</a>
<a id='line_468'>      could exhibit a legal right of inheritance. But the far greater</a>
<a id='line_469'>      part was extinct or lost; the vacant property had devolved to the</a>
<a id='line_470'>      lord; he repeopled Constantinople by a liberal invitation to the</a>
<a id='line_471'>      provinces; and the brave _volunteers_ were seated in the capital</a>
<a id='line_472'>      which had been recovered by their arms. The French barons and the</a>
<a id='line_473'>      principal families had retired with their emperor; but the</a>
<a id='line_474'>      patient and humble crowd of Latins was attached to the country,</a>
<a id='line_475'>      and indifferent to the change of masters. Instead of banishing</a>
<a id='line_476'>      the factories of the Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, the prudent</a>
<a id='line_477'>      conqueror accepted their oaths of allegiance, encouraged their</a>
<a id='line_478'>      industry, confirmed their privileges, and allowed them to live</a>
<a id='line_479'>      under the jurisdiction of their proper magistrates. Of these</a>
<a id='line_480'>      nations, the Pisans and Venetians preserved their respective</a>
<a id='line_481'>      quarters in the city; but the services and power of the Genoese</a>
<a id='line_482'>      deserved at the same time the gratitude and the jealousy of the</a>
<a id='line_483'>      Greeks. Their independent colony was first planted at the seaport</a>
<a id='line_484'>      town of Heraclea in Thrace. They were speedily recalled, and</a>
<a id='line_485'>      settled in the exclusive possession of the suburb of Galata, an</a>

<a id='line_513'>      and honors of John Lascaris, his pupil and lawful sovereign, were</a>
<a id='line_514'>      insensibly abolished. But his claims still lived in the minds of</a>
<a id='line_515'>      the people; and the royal youth must speedily attain the years of</a>
<a id='line_516'>      manhood and ambition. By fear or conscience, Palæologus was</a>
<a id='line_517'>      restrained from dipping his hands in innocent and royal blood;</a>
<a id='line_518'>      but the anxiety of a usurper and a parent urged him to secure his</a>
<a id='line_519'>      throne by one of those imperfect crimes so familiar to the modern</a>
<a id='line_520'>      Greeks. The loss of sight incapacitated the young prince for the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      active business of the world; instead of the brutal violence of</a>
<a id='line_522'>      tearing out his eyes, the visual nerve was destroyed by the</a>
<a id='line_523'>      intense glare of a red-hot basin, 22 and John Lascaris was</a>
<a id='line_524'>      removed to a distant castle, where he spent many years in privacy</a>
<a id='line_525'>      and oblivion. Such cool and deliberate guilt may seem</a>
<a id='line_526'>      incompatible with remorse; but if Michael could trust the mercy</a>
<a id='line_527'>      of Heaven, he was not inaccessible to the reproaches and</a>
<a id='line_528'>      vengeance of mankind, which he had provoked by cruelty and</a>
<a id='line_529'>      treason. His cruelty imposed on a servile court the duties of</a>
<a id='line_530'>      applause or silence; but the clergy had a right to speak in the</a>
<a id='line_531'>      name of their invisible Master; and their holy legions were led</a>
<a id='line_532'>      by a prelate, whose character was above the temptations of hope</a>
<a id='line_533'>      or fear. After a short abdication of his dignity, Arsenius 23 had</a>
<a id='line_534'>      consented to ascend the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_535'>      and to preside in the restoration of the church. His pious</a>
<a id='line_536'>      simplicity was long deceived by the arts of Palæologus; and his</a>
<a id='line_537'>      patience and submission might soothe the usurper, and protect the</a>
<a id='line_538'>      safety of the young prince. On the news of his inhuman treatment,</a>
<a id='line_539'>      the patriarch unsheathed the spiritual sword; and superstition,</a>
<a id='line_540'>      on this occasion, was enlisted in the cause of humanity and</a>
<a id='line_541'>      justice. In a synod of bishops, who were stimulated by the</a>
<a id='line_542'>      example of his zeal, the patriarch pronounced a sentence of</a>
<a id='line_543'>      excommunication; though his prudence still repeated the name of</a>
<a id='line_544'>      Michael in the public prayers. The Eastern prelates had not</a>
<a id='line_545'>      adopted the dangerous maxims of ancient Rome; nor did they</a>
<a id='line_546'>      presume to enforce their censures, by deposing princes, or</a>
<a id='line_547'>      absolving nations from their oaths of allegiance. But the</a>
<a id='line_548'>      Christian, who had been separated from God and the church, became</a>
<a id='line_549'>      an object of horror; and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital,</a>
<a id='line_550'>      that horror might arm the hand of an assassin, or inflame a</a>
<a id='line_551'>      sedition of the people. Palæologus felt his danger, confessed his</a>
<a id='line_552'>      guilt, and deprecated his judge: the act was irretrievable; the</a>
<a id='line_553'>      prize was obtained; and the most rigorous penance, which he</a>
<a id='line_554'>      solicited, would have raised the sinner to the reputation of a</a>
<a id='line_555'>      saint. The unrelenting patriarch refused to announce any means of</a>

<a id='line_557'>      pronounce, that for so great a crime, great indeed must be the</a>
<a id='line_558'>      satisfaction. “Do you require,” said Michael, “that I should</a>
<a id='line_559'>      abdicate the empire?” and at these words, he offered, or seemed</a>
<a id='line_560'>      to offer, the sword of state. Arsenius eagerly grasped this</a>
<a id='line_561'>      pledge of sovereignty; but when he perceived that the emperor was</a>
<a id='line_562'>      unwilling to purchase absolution at so dear a rate, he</a>

<a id='line_596'>      more indulgent judge; but it was far more easy and effectual to</a>

<a id='line_599'>      disaffection; 248 some irregular steps in his ordination and</a>

<a id='line_603'>      sullenly requested that a strict account might be taken of the</a>

<a id='line_606'>      continued to assert the freedom of his mind; and denied, with his</a>

<a id='line_608'>      25 After some delay, Gregory, 259 bishop of Adrianople, was</a>
<a id='line_609'>      translated to the Byzantine throne; but his authority was found</a>
<a id='line_610'>      insufficient to support the absolution of the emperor; and</a>
<a id='line_611'>      Joseph, a reverend monk, was substituted to that important</a>
<a id='line_612'>      function. This edifying scene was represented in the presence of</a>
<a id='line_613'>      the senate and the people; at the end of six years the humble</a>

<a id='line_615'>      humanity will rejoice, that a milder treatment of the captive</a>
<a id='line_616'>      Lascaris was stipulated as a proof of his remorse. But the spirit</a>
<a id='line_617'>      of Arsenius still survived in a powerful faction of the monks and</a>
<a id='line_618'>      clergy, who persevered about forty-eight years in an obstinate</a>
<a id='line_619'>      schism. Their scruples were treated with tenderness and respect</a>
<a id='line_620'>      by Michael and his son; and the reconciliation of the Arsenites</a>

<a id='line_728'>      alternately to urge the arguments of Christian charity and the</a>

<a id='line_734'>      proceeding from the Father and the Son, might be reduced to a</a>
<a id='line_735'>      safe and Catholic sense. 31 The supremacy of the pope was a</a>
<a id='line_736'>      doctrine more easy to conceive, but more painful to acknowledge:</a>

<a id='line_740'>      the liberties of the Eastern church from the mischievous</a>
<a id='line_741'>      consequences of the right of appeal. He protested that he would</a>
<a id='line_742'>      sacrifice his life and empire rather than yield the smallest</a>
<a id='line_743'>      point of orthodox faith or national independence; and this</a>

<a id='line_825'>      of Palæologus. His favorite generals, of his own blood, and</a>
<a id='line_826'>      family, successively deserted, or betrayed, the sacrilegious</a>

<a id='line_829'>      negotiated his ruin with the sultan of Egypt; and, in the public</a>

<a id='line_832'>      Palæologus exposed a naked recital of all that he had done and</a>

<a id='line_834'>      sectaries, of both sexes and every rank, had been deprived of</a>
<a id='line_835'>      their honors, their fortunes, and their liberty; a spreading list</a>
<a id='line_836'>      of confiscation and punishment, which involved many persons, the</a>
<a id='line_837'>      dearest to the emperor, or the best deserving of his favor. They</a>
<a id='line_838'>      were conducted to the prison, to behold four princes of the royal</a>

<a id='line_840'>      an agony of grief and rage. Two of these captives were afterwards</a>
<a id='line_841'>      released; the one by submission, the other by death: but the</a>
<a id='line_842'>      obstinacy of their two companions was chastised by the loss of</a>
<a id='line_843'>      their eyes; and the Greeks, the least adverse to the union,</a>
<a id='line_844'>      deplored that cruel and inauspicious tragedy. 35 Persecutors must</a>

<a id='line_850'>      to despise his followers, and to esteem and envy the rebel</a>

<a id='line_883'>      Constantinople had fallen to decay: they were restored and</a>
<a id='line_884'>      fortified by the policy of Michael, who deposited a plenteous</a>
<a id='line_885'>      store of corn and salt provisions, to sustain the siege which he</a>
<a id='line_886'>      might hourly expect from the resentment of the Western powers. Of</a>
<a id='line_887'>      these, the sovereign of the Two Sicilies was the most formidable</a>
<a id='line_888'>      neighbor: but as long as they were possessed by Mainfroy, the</a>
<a id='line_889'>      bastard of Frederic the Second, his monarchy was the bulwark,</a>
<a id='line_890'>      rather than the annoyance, of the Eastern empire. The usurper,</a>
<a id='line_891'>      though a brave and active prince, was sufficiently employed in</a>
<a id='line_892'>      the defence of his throne: his proscription by successive popes</a>
<a id='line_893'>      had separated Mainfroy from the common cause of the Latins; and</a>
<a id='line_894'>      the forces that might have besieged Constantinople were detained</a>
<a id='line_895'>      in a crusade against the domestic enemy of Rome. The prize of her</a>
<a id='line_896'>      avenger, the crown of the Two Sicilies, was won and worn by the</a>
<a id='line_897'>      brother of St Louis, by Charles count of Anjou and Provence, who</a>
<a id='line_898'>      led the chivalry of France on this holy expedition. 37 The</a>
<a id='line_899'>      disaffection of his Christian subjects compelled Mainfroy to</a>
<a id='line_900'>      enlist a colony of Saracens whom his father had planted in</a>
<a id='line_901'>      Apulia; and this odious succor will explain the defiance of the</a>
<a id='line_902'>      Catholic hero, who rejected all terms of accommodation. “Bear</a>
<a id='line_903'>      this message,” said Charles, “to the sultan of Nocera, that God</a>
<a id='line_904'>      and the sword are umpire between us; and that he shall either</a>
<a id='line_905'>      send me to paradise, or I will send him to the pit of hell.” The</a>
<a id='line_906'>      armies met: and though I am ignorant of Mainfroy’s doom in the</a>
<a id='line_907'>      other world, in this he lost his friends, his kingdom, and his</a>
<a id='line_908'>      life, in the bloody battle of Benevento. Naples and Sicily were</a>
<a id='line_909'>      immediately peopled with a warlike race of French nobles; and</a>
<a id='line_910'>      their aspiring leader embraced the future conquest of Africa,</a>
<a id='line_911'>      Greece, and Palestine. The most specious reasons might point his</a>
<a id='line_912'>      first arms against the Byzantine empire; and Palæologus,</a>
<a id='line_913'>      diffident of his own strength, repeatedly appealed from the</a>
<a id='line_914'>      ambition of Charles to the humanity of St. Louis, who still</a>
<a id='line_915'>      preserved a just ascendant over the mind of his ferocious</a>
<a id='line_916'>      brother. For a while the attention of that brother was confined</a>
<a id='line_917'>      at home by the invasion of Conradin, the last heir to the</a>
<a id='line_918'>      imperial house of Swabia; but the hapless boy sunk in the unequal</a>
<a id='line_919'>      conflict; and his execution on a public scaffold taught the</a>
<a id='line_920'>      rivals of Charles to tremble for their heads as well as their</a>
<a id='line_921'>      dominions. A second respite was obtained by the last crusade of</a>
<a id='line_922'>      St. Louis to the African coast; and the double motive of interest</a>
<a id='line_923'>      and duty urged the king of Naples to assist, with his powers and</a>
<a id='line_924'>      his presence, the holy enterprise. The death of St. Louis</a>
<a id='line_925'>      released him from the importunity of a virtuous censor: the king</a>
<a id='line_926'>      of Tunis confessed himself the tributary and vassal of the crown</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of Sicily; and the boldest of the French knights were free to</a>
<a id='line_928'>      enlist under his banner against the Greek empire. A treaty and a</a>
<a id='line_929'>      marriage united his interest with the house of Courtenay; his</a>
<a id='line_930'>      daughter Beatrice was promised to Philip, son and heir of the</a>
<a id='line_931'>      emperor Baldwin; a pension of six hundred ounces of gold was</a>
<a id='line_932'>      allowed for his maintenance; and his generous father distributed</a>
<a id='line_933'>      among his aliens the kingdoms and provinces of the East,</a>
<a id='line_934'>      reserving only Constantinople, and one day’s journey round the</a>
<a id='line_935'>      city for the imperial domain. 38 In this perilous moment,</a>
<a id='line_936'>      Palæologus was the most eager to subscribe the creed, and implore</a>
<a id='line_937'>      the protection, of the Roman pontiff, who assumed, with propriety</a>
<a id='line_938'>      and weight, the character of an angel of peace, the common father</a>
<a id='line_939'>      of the Christians. By his voice, the sword of Charles was chained</a>
<a id='line_940'>      in the scabbard; and the Greek ambassadors beheld him, in the</a>
<a id='line_941'>      pope’s antechamber, biting his ivory sceptre in a transport of</a>
<a id='line_942'>      fury, and deeply resenting the refusal to enfranchise and</a>
<a id='line_943'>      consecrate his arms. He appears to have respected the</a>
<a id='line_944'>      disinterested mediation of Gregory the Tenth; but Charles was</a>
<a id='line_945'>      insensibly disgusted by the pride and partiality of Nicholas the</a>
<a id='line_946'>      Third; and his attachment to his kindred, the Ursini family,</a>
<a id='line_947'>      alienated the most strenuous champion from the service of the</a>
<a id='line_948'>      church. The hostile league against the Greeks, of Philip the</a>
<a id='line_949'>      Latin emperor, the king of the Two Sicilies, and the republic of</a>
<a id='line_950'>      Venice, was ripened into execution; and the election of Martin</a>
<a id='line_951'>      the Fourth, a French pope, gave a sanction to the cause. Of the</a>
<a id='line_952'>      allies, Philip supplied his name; Martin, a bull of</a>
<a id='line_953'>      excommunication; the Venetians, a squadron of forty galleys; and</a>
<a id='line_954'>      the formidable powers of Charles consisted of forty counts, ten</a>
<a id='line_955'>      thousand men at arms, a numerous body of infantry, and a fleet of</a>
<a id='line_956'>      more than three hundred ships and transports. A distant day was</a>
<a id='line_957'>      appointed for assembling this mighty force in the harbor of</a>

<a id='line_1001'>      of freedom by the eloquence of Procida; and he displayed to every</a>

<a id='line_1003'>      of foreign aid, he successively visited the courts of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      emperor, and of Peter king of Arragon, 41 who possessed the</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      maritime countries of Valentia and Catalonia. To the ambitious</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      Peter a crown was presented, which he might justly claim by his</a>

<a id='line_1132'>      endangered the empire of his son. In modern times our debts and</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      taxes are the secret poison which still corrodes the bosom of</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      peace: but in the weak and disorderly government of the middle</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      ages, it was agitated by the present evil of the disbanded</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      armies. Too idle to work, too proud to beg, the mercenaries were</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      accustomed to a life of rapine: they could rob with more dignity</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      and effect under a banner and a chief; and the sovereign, to whom</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      their service was useless, and their presence importunate,</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      endeavored to discharge the torrent on some neighboring</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      countries. After the peace of Sicily, many thousands of Genoese,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      _Catalans_, 47 &c., who had fought, by sea and land, under the</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      standard of Anjou or Arragon, were blended into one nation by the</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      resemblance of their manners and interest. They heard that the</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      Greek provinces of Asia were invaded by the Turks: they resolved</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      to share the harvest of pay and plunder: and Frederic king of</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      Sicily most liberally contributed the means of their departure.</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      In a warfare of twenty years, a ship, or a camp, was become their</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      country; arms were their sole profession and property; valor was</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      the only virtue which they knew; their women had imbibed the</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      fearless temper of their lovers and husbands: it was reported,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      that, with a stroke of their broadsword, the Catalans could</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      cleave a horseman and a horse; and the report itself was a</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      powerful weapon. Roger de Flor 477 was the most popular of their</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      chiefs; and his personal merit overshadowed the dignity of his</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      prouder rivals of Arragon. The offspring of a marriage between a</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      German gentleman of the court of Frederic the Second and a damsel</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      of Brindisi, Roger was successively a templar, an apostate, a</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      pirate, and at length the richest and most powerful admiral of</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      the Mediterranean. He sailed from Messina to Constantinople, with</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      eighteen galleys, four great ships, and eight thousand</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      adventurers; 478 and his previous treaty was faithfully</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      accomplished by Andronicus the elder, who accepted with joy and</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      terror this formidable succor. A palace was allotted for his</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      reception, and a niece of the emperor was given in marriage to</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      the valiant stranger, who was immediately created great duke or</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      admiral of Romania. After a decent repose, he transported his</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      troops over the Propontis, and boldly led them against the Turks:</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      in two bloody battles thirty thousand of the Moslems were slain:</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      he raised the siege of Philadelphia, and deserved the name of the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      deliverer of Asia. But after a short season of prosperity, the</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      cloud of slavery and ruin again burst on that unhappy province.</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      The inhabitants escaped (says a Greek historian) from the smoke</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      into the flames; and the hostility of the Turks was less</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      pernicious than the friendship of the Catalans. 479 The lives and</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      fortunes which they had rescued they considered as their own: the</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      willing or reluctant maid was saved from the race of circumcision</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      for the embraces of a Christian soldier: the exaction of fines</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      and supplies was enforced by licentious rapine and arbitrary</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      executions; and, on the resistance of Magnesia, the great duke</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      besieged a city of the Roman empire. 48 These disorders he</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      excused by the wrongs and passions of a victorious army; nor</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      would his own authority or person have been safe, had he dared to</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      punish his faithful followers, who were defrauded of the just and</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      covenanted price of their services. The threats and complaints of</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      Andronicus disclosed the nakedness of the empire. His golden bull</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      had invited no more than five hundred horse and a thousand foot</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      soldiers; yet the crowds of volunteers, who migrated to the East,</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      had been enlisted and fed by his spontaneous bounty. While his</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      bravest allies were content with three byzants or pieces of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      for their monthly pay, an ounce, or even two ounces, of gold were</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      assigned to the Catalans, whose annual pension would thus amount</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      to near a hundred pounds sterling: one of their chiefs had</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      modestly rated at three hundred thousand crowns the value of his</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      _future_ merits; and above a million had been issued from the</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      treasury for the maintenance of these costly mercenaries. A cruel</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      tax had been imposed on the corn of the husbandman: one third was</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      retrenched from the salaries of the public officers; and the</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      standard of the coin was so shamefully debased, that of the</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      four-and-twenty parts only five were of pure gold. 49 At the</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      summons of the emperor, Roger evacuated a province which no</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      longer supplied the materials of rapine; 496 but he refused to</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      disperse his troops; and while his style was respectful, his</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      conduct was independent and hostile. He protested, that if the</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      emperor should march against him, he would advance forty paces to</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      kiss the ground before him; but in rising from this prostrate</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      attitude Roger had a life and sword at the service of his</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      friends. The great duke of Romania condescended to accept the</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      title and ornaments of Cæsar; but he rejected the new proposal of</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      the government of Asia with a subsidy of corn and money, 497 on</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      condition that he should reduce his troops to the harmless number</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      of three thousand men. Assassination is the last resource of</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      cowards. The Cæsar was tempted to visit the royal residence of</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      Adrianople; in the apartment, and before the eyes, of the empress</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      he was stabbed by the Alani guards; and though the deed was</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      imputed to their private revenge, 498 his countrymen, who dwelt</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      at Constantinople in the security of peace, were involved in the</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      same proscription by the prince or people. The loss of their</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      leader intimidated the crowd of adventurers, who hoisted the</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      sails of flight, and were soon scattered round the coasts of the</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      Mediterranean. But a veteran band of fifteen hundred Catalans, or</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      French, stood firm in the strong fortress of Gallipoli on the</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      Hellespont, displayed the banners of Arragon, and offered to</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      revenge and justify their chief, by an equal combat of ten or a</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      hundred warriors. Instead of accepting this bold defiance, the</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      emperor Michael, the son and colleague of Andronicus, resolved to</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      oppress them with the weight of multitudes: every nerve was</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and thirty</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      thousand foot; and the Propontis was covered with the ships of</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      the Greeks and Genoese. In two battles by sea and land, these</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      mighty forces were encountered and overthrown by the despair and</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      discipline of the Catalans: the young emperor fled to the palace;</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      and an insufficient guard of light-horse was left for the</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      protection of the open country. Victory renewed the hopes and</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      numbers of the adventures: every nation was blended under the</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      name and standard of the _great company_; and three thousand</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      Turkish proselytes deserted from the Imperial service to join</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      this military association. In the possession of Gallipoli, 509</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      the Catalans intercepted the trade of Constantinople and the</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      Black Sea, while they spread their devastation on either side of</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      the Hellespont over the confines of Europe and Asia. To prevent</a>
