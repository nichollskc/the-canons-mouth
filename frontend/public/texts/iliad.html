<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>INTRODUCTION.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of</a>
<a id='line_137'>scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most</a>
<a id='line_138'>part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual</a>
<a id='line_139'>character of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate</a>
<a id='line_140'>ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old</a>
<a id='line_141'>notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily</a>
<a id='line_142'>unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to</a>
<a id='line_143'>acquire.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which</a>
<a id='line_146'>progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which</a>
<a id='line_147'>persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of</a>
<a id='line_148'>their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away</a>
<a id='line_149'>traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of</a>
<a id='line_150'>sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive</a>
<a id='line_151'>superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The</a>
<a id='line_152'>credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful a</a>
<a id='line_153'>touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a</a>
<a id='line_154'>temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the</a>
<a id='line_155'>impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition,</a>
<a id='line_156'>whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very</a>
<a id='line_157'>different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former</a>
<a id='line_158'>ages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives</a>
<a id='line_159'>of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his</a>
<a id='line_160'>history, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and</a>
<a id='line_161'>troublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large</a>
<a id='line_162'>portion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less</a>
<a id='line_163'>pertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we</a>
<a id='line_164'>must know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of</a>
<a id='line_165'>extended experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.</a>
<a id='line_166'>Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human</a>
<a id='line_167'>experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form correct</a>
<a id='line_168'>views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great</a>
<a id='line_169'>whole--we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom</a>
<a id='line_170'>they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives or</a>
<a id='line_171'>condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider</a>
<a id='line_172'>the general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective</a>
<a id='line_173'>probability of its details.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know</a>
<a id='line_176'>least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere(1) have, perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_177'>contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any</a>
<a id='line_178'>other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all three</a>
<a id='line_179'>has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us</a>
<a id='line_180'>little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will</a>
<a id='line_181'>follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which</a>
<a id='line_182'>critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything</a>
<a id='line_183'>else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt</a>
<a id='line_184'>and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of</a>
<a id='line_185'>Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the _dramatis</a>
<a id='line_186'>personae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears as</a>
<a id='line_187'>the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the</a>
<a id='line_188'>writers who have handed them down. When we have read Plato _or_ Xenophon,</a>
<a id='line_189'>we think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and</a>
<a id='line_190'>examined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than</a>
<a id='line_191'>ignorant.</a>
<a id='line_192'></a>
<a id='line_193'>It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the</a>
<a id='line_194'>personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were</a>
<a id='line_195'>too much for our belief. This system--which has often comforted the</a>
<a id='line_196'>religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those</a>
<a id='line_197'>of the New Testament--has been of incalculable value to the historical</a>
<a id='line_198'>theorists of the last and present centuries. To question the existence of</a>
<a id='line_199'>Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in</a>
<a id='line_200'>that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is</a>
<a id='line_201'>inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no</a>
<a id='line_202'>two scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in</a>
<a id='line_203'>the good-natured old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has</a>
<a id='line_204'>idealized--_Numa Pompilius._</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and</a>
<a id='line_207'>the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission</a>
<a id='line_208'>to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition,</a>
<a id='line_209'>concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few</a>
<a id='line_210'>authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the</a>
<a id='line_211'>arguments appear to run in a circle. "This cannot be true, because it is</a>
<a id='line_212'>not true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true." Such seems to</a>
<a id='line_213'>be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement,</a>
<a id='line_214'>is consigned to denial and oblivion.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are</a>
<a id='line_217'>partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which</a>
<a id='line_218'>truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the</a>
<a id='line_219'>Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the</a>
<a id='line_220'>treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>According to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia, was, at an early</a>
<a id='line_223'>period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece.</a>
<a id='line_224'>Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor,</a>
<a id='line_225'>he married, and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis. The</a>
<a id='line_226'>girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of</a>
<a id='line_227'>Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we "are</a>
<a id='line_228'>indebted for so much happiness." Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile</a>
<a id='line_229'>frailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near</a>
<a id='line_230'>the river Meles, in Boeotia, whither Critheis had been transported in</a>
<a id='line_231'>order to save her reputation.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>"At this time," continues our narrative, "there lived at Smyrna a man</a>
<a id='line_234'>named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married,</a>
<a id='line_235'>engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as</a>
<a id='line_236'>the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was her performance</a>
<a id='line_237'>of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of</a>
<a id='line_238'>marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her</a>
<a id='line_239'>son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were carefully</a>
<a id='line_240'>brought up."</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature</a>
<a id='line_243'>had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every</a>
<a id='line_244'>attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius</a>
<a id='line_245'>died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed.</a>
<a id='line_246'>Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great success,</a>
<a id='line_247'>exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of</a>
<a id='line_248'>the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the</a>
<a id='line_249'>exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these visitors, one</a>
<a id='line_250'>Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and</a>
<a id='line_251'>intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close</a>
<a id='line_252'>his school, and accompany him on his travels. He promised not only to pay</a>
<a id='line_253'>his expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that,</a>
<a id='line_254'>"While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own</a>
<a id='line_255'>eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his</a>
<a id='line_256'>discourses." Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron,</a>
<a id='line_257'>"examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and</a>
<a id='line_258'>informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met." We</a>
<a id='line_259'>may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of</a>
<a id='line_260'>preservation(2) Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached</a>
<a id='line_261'>Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became</a>
<a id='line_262'>much worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to</a>
<a id='line_263'>the medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of</a>
<a id='line_264'>Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly</a>
<a id='line_265'>became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards</a>
<a id='line_266'>formed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that</a>
<a id='line_267'>it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their</a>
<a id='line_268'>city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he</a>
<a id='line_269'>applied himself to the study of poetry.(3)</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean</a>
<a id='line_272'>plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae. Here</a>
<a id='line_273'>his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one</a>
<a id='line_274'>Tychias, an armourer. "And up to my time," continued the author, "the</a>
<a id='line_275'>inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation</a>
<a id='line_276'>of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar</a>
<a id='line_277'>grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived".(4)</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being</a>
<a id='line_280'>the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on</a>
<a id='line_281'>Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability,</a>
<a id='line_282'>been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.(5)</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the _converzationes_(6) of the old men,</a>
<a id='line_285'>and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this</a>
<a id='line_286'>favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a public</a>
<a id='line_287'>maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously  renowned. They</a>
<a id='line_288'>avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and</a>
<a id='line_289'>procured him an audience in the council. Having made the speech, with the</a>
<a id='line_290'>purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and</a>
<a id='line_291'>left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's demand,</a>
<a id='line_294'>but one man observed that "if they were to feed _Homers,_ they would be</a>
<a id='line_295'>encumbered with a multitude of useless people." "From this circumstance,"</a>
<a id='line_296'>says the writer, "Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans</a>
<a id='line_297'>call blind men _Homers._"(7) With a love of economy, which shows how</a>
<a id='line_298'>similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the</a>
<a id='line_299'>pension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that</a>
<a id='line_300'>Cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.</a>
<a id='line_301'></a>
<a id='line_302'>At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.</a>
<a id='line_303'>One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept</a>
<a id='line_304'>Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the</a>
<a id='line_305'>verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient poetry</a>
<a id='line_306'>to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers,</a>
<a id='line_307'>neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him. At his</a>
<a id='line_308'>departure, Homer is said to have observed: "O Thestorides, of the many</a>
<a id='line_309'>things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible</a>
<a id='line_310'>than the human heart."(8)</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian</a>
<a id='line_313'>merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite,</a>
<a id='line_314'>acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable</a>
<a id='line_315'>livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at once determined</a>
<a id='line_316'>him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be setting sail</a>
<a id='line_317'>thither, but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia,</a>
<a id='line_318'>which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to</a>
<a id='line_319'>accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_320'>that he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his</a>
<a id='line_321'>breach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in</a>
<a id='line_324'>Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached</a>
<a id='line_325'>the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will</a>
<a id='line_326'>continue in the words of our author. "Having set out from Pithys, Homer</a>
<a id='line_327'>went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The</a>
<a id='line_328'>dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the</a>
<a id='line_329'>name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his</a>
<a id='line_330'>dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or some time he stood wondering</a>
<a id='line_331'>how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be</a>
<a id='line_332'>his design in coming. He then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and</a>
<a id='line_333'>how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he</a>
<a id='line_334'>stood in need. Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his</a>
<a id='line_335'>misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to</a>
<a id='line_336'>his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup.(9)</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to</a>
<a id='line_339'>their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my</a>
<a id='line_340'>friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper at</a>
<a id='line_341'>the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor</a>
<a id='line_342'>thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having</a>
<a id='line_345'>finished supper, they banqueted(10) afresh on conversation, Homer</a>
<a id='line_346'>narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus</a>
<a id='line_349'>resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with</a>
<a id='line_350'>Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer</a>
<a id='line_351'>at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place</a>
<a id='line_352'>near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story</a>
<a id='line_353'>respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what he</a>
<a id='line_354'>said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed</a>
<a id='line_355'>and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger to him.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring</a>
<a id='line_358'>him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed that</a>
<a id='line_359'>the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the</a>
<a id='line_360'>Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of his</a>
<a id='line_361'>children.(11)</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the</a>
<a id='line_364'>island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of</a>
<a id='line_365'>Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry. "To</a>
<a id='line_366'>this day," says Chandler,(12) "the most curious remain is that which has</a>
<a id='line_367'>been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the coast, at</a>
<a id='line_368'>some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have been an open</a>
<a id='line_369'>temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in</a>
<a id='line_370'>the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She</a>
<a id='line_371'>is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each</a>
<a id='line_372'>side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and</a>
<a id='line_373'>about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude,</a>
<a id='line_374'>indistinct, and probably of the most remote antiquity."</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable fortune.</a>
<a id='line_377'>He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other</a>
<a id='line_378'>married a Chian.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages</a>
<a id='line_381'>of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already been</a>
<a id='line_382'>mentioned:--</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>"In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards</a>
<a id='line_385'>Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his poem</a>
<a id='line_386'>as the companion of Ulysses,(13) in return for the care taken of him when</a>
<a id='line_387'>afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who</a>
<a id='line_388'>had given him both sustenance and instruction."</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>
<a id='line_390'>His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to visit</a>
<a id='line_391'>Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is said, made</a>
<a id='line_392'>some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the</a>
<a id='line_393'>Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,(14) he sent out</a>
<a id='line_394'>for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him in</a>
<a id='line_395'>Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the</a>
<a id='line_396'>Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction,</a>
<a id='line_397'>and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a</a>
<a id='line_398'>subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he was</a>
<a id='line_399'>very popular.</a>
<a id='line_400'></a>
<a id='line_401'>In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios, now</a>
<a id='line_402'>Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his death</a>
<a id='line_403'>arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed</a>
<a id='line_404'>by some fishermen's children.(15)</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess,</a>
<a id='line_407'>and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is</a>
<a id='line_408'>scarcely necessary to point them out in detail. Let us now consider some</a>
<a id='line_409'>of the opinions to which a persevering, patient, and learned--but by no</a>
<a id='line_410'>means consistent--series of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess</a>
<a id='line_411'>to bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or</a>
<a id='line_412'>probability.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>"Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in</a>
<a id='line_415'>doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who have</a>
<a id='line_416'>done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The majestic</a>
<a id='line_417'>stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the Nile, through</a>
<a id='line_418'>many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains</a>
<a id='line_419'>will ever remain concealed."</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has</a>
<a id='line_422'>eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric</a>
<a id='line_423'>question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:--</a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
<a id='line_425'>"It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of</a>
<a id='line_426'>things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the region</a>
<a id='line_427'>of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of</a>
<a id='line_428'>genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part,</a>
<a id='line_429'>created far out of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of</a>
<a id='line_430'>all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin</a>
<a id='line_431'>of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points,</a>
<a id='line_432'>must have remained the secret of the poet." (16)</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human</a>
<a id='line_435'>nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let</a>
<a id='line_436'>us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual?(17) or</a>
<a id='line_437'>were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of</a>
<a id='line_438'>fragments by earlier poets?</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>Well has Landor remarked: "Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some</a>
<a id='line_441'>deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the</a>
<a id='line_442'>contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are</a>
<a id='line_443'>perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion</a>
<a id='line_444'>to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good</a>
<a id='line_445'>for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good.</a>
<a id='line_446'>No man living venerates Homer more than I do." (18)</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented</a>
<a id='line_449'>with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered,</a>
<a id='line_450'>without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute</a>
<a id='line_451'>analysis--our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the</a>
<a id='line_452'>doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to</a>
<a id='line_453'>entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his</a>
<a id='line_454'>imagination, and to condescend to dry details.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of this</a>
<a id='line_457'>unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must express my</a>
<a id='line_458'>sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:--</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>"We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better,</a>
<a id='line_461'>the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original</a>
<a id='line_462'>composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive</a>
<a id='line_463'>integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to assert, that the</a>
<a id='line_464'>minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification</a>
<a id='line_465'>for the profound feeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious</a>
<a id='line_466'>whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the</a>
<a id='line_467'>human frame: and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on</a>
<a id='line_468'>the proportions and general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_469'>Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.</a>
<a id='line_470'></a>
<a id='line_471'>"There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of</a>
<a id='line_472'>Pope.--</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>  "'The critic eye--that microscope of wit</a>
<a id='line_475'>  Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,</a>
<a id='line_476'>  How parts relate to parts, or they to whole</a>
<a id='line_477'>  The body's harmony, the beaming soul,</a>
<a id='line_478'>  Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,</a>
<a id='line_479'>  When man's whole frame is obvious to a flea.'"(19)</a>
<a id='line_480'></a>
<a id='line_481'>Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the</a>
<a id='line_482'>unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious</a>
<a id='line_483'>Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,(20) the</a>
<a id='line_484'>authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.</a>
<a id='line_485'>Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching</a>
<a id='line_486'>the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,(21) and, among a</a>
<a id='line_487'>mass of ancient authors, whose very names(22) it would be tedious to</a>
<a id='line_488'>detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever arose. So</a>
<a id='line_489'>far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on</a>
<a id='line_490'>the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern</a>
<a id='line_491'>investigations lay claim.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the</a>
<a id='line_494'>subject, and we find Bentley remarking that "Homer wrote a sequel of songs</a>
<a id='line_495'>and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer,</a>
<a id='line_496'>at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs were not</a>
<a id='line_497'>collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus'</a>
<a id='line_498'>time, about five hundred years after."(23)</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>Two French writers--Hedelin and Perrault--avowed a similar scepticism on the</a>
<a id='line_501'>subject; but it is in the "Scienza Nuova" of Battista Vico, that we first</a>
<a id='line_502'>meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf with so</a>
<a id='line_503'>much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that we</a>
<a id='line_504'>have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we</a>
<a id='line_505'>will detail in the words of Grote(24)--</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,</a>
<a id='line_508'>turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently</a>
<a id='line_509'>published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the</a>
<a id='line_510'>Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means</a>
<a id='line_511'>the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced</a>
<a id='line_512'>by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the</a>
<a id='line_513'>Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and</a>
<a id='line_514'>unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century</a>
<a id='line_515'>before Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no</a>
<a id='line_516'>written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the</a>
<a id='line_517'>earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without</a>
<a id='line_518'>writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have</a>
<a id='line_519'>been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him,</a>
<a id='line_520'>transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and</a>
<a id='line_521'>convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long</a>
<a id='line_522'>manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf's</a>
<a id='line_523'>case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch,</a>
<a id='line_524'>and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the</a>
<a id='line_525'>other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been</a>
<a id='line_526'>considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character</a>
<a id='line_527'>of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from</a>
<a id='line_528'>the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_529'></a>
<a id='line_530'>"To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to</a>
<a id='line_531'>Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are</a>
<a id='line_532'>nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view</a>
<a id='line_533'>of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it, we</a>
<a id='line_534'>were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninth</a>
<a id='line_535'>century before the Christian aera. Few things, in my opinion, can be more</a>
<a id='line_536'>improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfian</a>
<a id='line_537'>hypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writing</a>
<a id='line_538'>in Greece, even in the seventh century before the Christian aera, are</a>
<a id='line_539'>exceedingly trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than the</a>
<a id='line_540'>fortieth Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully</a>
<a id='line_541'>executed; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides</a>
<a id='line_542'>of Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and</a>
<a id='line_543'>lyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the</a>
<a id='line_544'>practice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which</a>
<a id='line_545'>authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the</a>
<a id='line_546'>famous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the</a>
<a id='line_547'>Panathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had</a>
<a id='line_548'>existed, we are unable to say.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>"Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the</a>
<a id='line_551'>beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the</a>
<a id='line_552'>existing habits of society with regard to poetry--for they admit generally</a>
<a id='line_553'>that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but upon</a>
<a id='line_554'>the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the</a>
<a id='line_555'>preservation of the poems--the unassisted memory of reciters being neither</a>
<a id='line_556'>sufficient nor trustworthy. But here we only escape a smaller difficulty</a>
<a id='line_557'>by running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted with</a>
<a id='line_558'>extraordinary memory, (25) is far less astonishing than that of long</a>
<a id='line_559'>manuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when</a>
<a id='line_560'>even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious.</a>
<a id='line_561'>Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard</a>
<a id='line_562'>was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a</a>
<a id='line_563'>manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a</a>
<a id='line_564'>disqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as</a>
<a id='line_565'>well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the</a>
<a id='line_566'>blind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as</a>
<a id='line_567'>well as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer</a>
<a id='line_568'>himself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have</a>
<a id='line_569'>described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he</a>
<a id='line_570'>had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by</a>
<a id='line_571'>constant reference to the manuscript in his chest."</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon which</a>
<a id='line_574'>even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt,</a>
<a id='line_575'>that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable</a>
<a id='line_576'>change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems</a>
<a id='line_577'>could have suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved. If</a>
<a id='line_578'>Chaucer's poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have</a>
<a id='line_579'>come down to us in a softened form, more like the effeminate version of</a>
<a id='line_580'>Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original.</a>
<a id='line_581'></a>
<a id='line_582'>"At what period," continues Grote, "these poems, or indeed any other Greek</a>
<a id='line_583'>poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though</a>
<a id='line_584'>there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon. If, in</a>
<a id='line_585'>the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinate</a>
<a id='line_586'>period, the question a once suggests itself, What were the purposes which,</a>
<a id='line_587'>in that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have</a>
<a id='line_588'>been intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not for</a>
<a id='line_589'>the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but</a>
<a id='line_590'>also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all</a>
<a id='line_591'>those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices</a>
<a id='line_592'>which were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript</a>
<a id='line_593'>could never reproduce. Not for the general public--they were accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_594'>receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a</a>
<a id='line_595'>solemn and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad</a>
<a id='line_596'>would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class</a>
<a id='line_597'>of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had</a>
<a id='line_598'>experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the</a>
<a id='line_599'>written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the</a>
<a id='line_600'>impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may</a>
<a id='line_601'>seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and</a>
<a id='line_602'>there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. If</a>
<a id='line_603'>we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we</a>
<a id='line_604'>should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were</a>
<a id='line_605'>first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest</a>
<a id='line_606'>probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of</a>
<a id='line_607'>the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh</a>
<a id='line_608'>century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of</a>
<a id='line_609'>Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, &c. I ground this</a>
<a id='line_610'>supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of</a>
<a id='line_611'>Grecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having been</a>
<a id='line_612'>introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions</a>
<a id='line_613'>having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and</a>
<a id='line_614'>real life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only</a>
<a id='line_615'>known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable,</a>
<a id='line_616'>yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking</a>
<a id='line_617'>at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new</a>
<a id='line_618'>poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be</a>
<a id='line_619'>considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their</a>
<a id='line_620'>own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies,</a>
<a id='line_621'>just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais</a>
<a id='line_622'>as the production of Homer. There seems, therefore, ground for</a>
<a id='line_623'>conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but</a>
<a id='line_624'>very narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old</a>
<a id='line_625'>epics,--the Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the</a>
<a id='line_626'>Odyssey,--began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century</a>
<a id='line_627'>(B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place</a>
<a id='line_628'>about the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining</a>
<a id='line_629'>the requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed,</a>
<a id='line_630'>would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with</a>
<a id='line_631'>it; so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers</a>
<a id='line_632'>and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a</a>
<a id='line_633'>certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against</a>
<a id='line_634'>the carelessness of individual rhapsodes."(26)</a>
<a id='line_635'></a>
<a id='line_636'>But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the</a>
<a id='line_637'>credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following</a>
<a id='line_638'>observations--</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>    "There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,</a>
<a id='line_642'>    throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid</a>
<a id='line_643'>    compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast</a>
<a id='line_644'>    into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of</a>
<a id='line_645'>    the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the</a>
<a id='line_646'>    bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited</a>
<a id='line_647'>    little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus,</a>
<a id='line_648'>    Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task of</a>
<a id='line_649'>    compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to</a>
<a id='line_650'>    arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible,</a>
<a id='line_651'>    that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain.</a>
<a id='line_652'>    Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no</a>
<a id='line_653'>    doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the</a>
<a id='line_654'>    Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have</a>
<a id='line_655'>    perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have</a>
<a id='line_656'>    caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among</a>
<a id='line_657'>    the heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in</a>
<a id='line_658'>    reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however,</a>
<a id='line_659'>    finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more</a>
<a id='line_660'>    marked and distinguishing characteristics--still it is difficult to</a>
<a id='line_661'>    suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and</a>
<a id='line_662'>    transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray</a>
<a id='line_663'>    the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of</a>
<a id='line_664'>    expression. It is not quite in character with such a period to</a>
<a id='line_665'>    imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem</a>
<a id='line_666'>    in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in</a>
<a id='line_667'>    his continuation of Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'>    "If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of</a>
<a id='line_670'>    Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the</a>
<a id='line_671'>    poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps</a>
<a id='line_672'>    no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may fairly be</a>
<a id='line_673'>    suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than</a>
<a id='line_674'>    ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all</a>
<a id='line_675'>    the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the</a>
<a id='line_676'>    Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant</a>
<a id='line_677'>    part. Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors, Mr.</a>
<a id='line_678'>    Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible, indeed, that</a>
<a id='line_679'>    in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic fact,</a>
<a id='line_680'>    that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against</a>
<a id='line_681'>    the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the</a>
<a id='line_682'>    chieftain of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his</a>
<a id='line_683'>    forces, may have been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian</a>
<a id='line_684'>    sovereign; the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the</a>
<a id='line_685'>    Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the</a>
<a id='line_686'>    Athenians to yield to their taste. The songs which spoke of their</a>
<a id='line_687'>    own great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and</a>
<a id='line_688'>    popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid would have been much</a>
<a id='line_689'>    more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers</a>
<a id='line_690'>    of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid. Could France</a>
<a id='line_691'>    have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the hero of</a>
<a id='line_692'>    the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are</a>
<a id='line_693'>    sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all</a>
<a id='line_694'>    its direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the</a>
<a id='line_695'>    poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,--it is still surprising, that</a>
<a id='line_696'>    throughout the whole poem the _callida junctura_ should never</a>
<a id='line_697'>    betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national</a>
<a id='line_698'>    spirit of a race, who have at a later period not inaptly been</a>
<a id='line_699'>    compared to our self admiring neighbours, the French, should</a>
<a id='line_700'>    submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of</a>
<a id='line_701'>    their own ancestors--or, at least, to the questionable dignity of</a>
<a id='line_702'>    only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military</a>
<a id='line_703'>    tactics of his age."(27)</a>
<a id='line_704'></a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that Wolf's</a>
<a id='line_707'>objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never</a>
<a id='line_708'>been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to</a>
<a id='line_709'>enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties with</a>
<a id='line_710'>which the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if</a>
<a id='line_711'>we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's(28) modification of his theory</a>
<a id='line_712'>any better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad into</a>
<a id='line_713'>sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their</a>
<a id='line_714'>amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the</a>
<a id='line_715'>age of Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, "explains the gaps and</a>
<a id='line_716'>contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else." Moreover,</a>
<a id='line_717'>we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called</a>
<a id='line_718'>sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the</a>
<a id='line_719'>first battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the</a>
<a id='line_720'>Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of</a>
<a id='line_721'>the Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes</a>
<a id='line_722'>again make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that</a>
<a id='line_723'>"it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so</a>
<a id='line_724'>harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel." The</a>
<a id='line_725'>discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the fifth</a>
<a id='line_726'>book, weeps at his son's funeral in the thirteenth, can only be regarded</a>
<a id='line_727'>as the result of an interpolation.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the</a>
<a id='line_730'>subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian</a>
<a id='line_731'>theory, and of Lachmann's modifications with the character of</a>
<a id='line_732'>Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success, that</a>
<a id='line_733'>the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems, or,</a>
<a id='line_734'>supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by Peisistratus, and</a>
<a id='line_735'>not before his time, are essentially distinct. In short, "a man may</a>
<a id='line_736'>believe the Iliad to have been put together out of pre-existing songs,</a>
<a id='line_737'>without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first</a>
<a id='line_738'>compilation." The friends or literary _employes_ of Peisistratus must have</a>
<a id='line_739'>found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the silence of the</a>
<a id='line_740'>Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic "recension," goes far to</a>
<a id='line_741'>prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts they examined, this was either</a>
<a id='line_742'>wanting, or thought unworthy of attention.</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>"Moreover," he continues, "the whole tenor of the poems themselves</a>
<a id='line_745'>confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad or</a>
<a id='line_746'>Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of</a>
<a id='line_747'>Peisistratus--nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought</a>
<a id='line_748'>about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the</a>
<a id='line_749'>habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments,</a>
<a id='line_750'>the close military array, the improved construction of ships, the</a>
<a id='line_751'>Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious</a>
<a id='line_752'>festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c., familiar to</a>
<a id='line_753'>the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the other literary</a>
<a id='line_754'>friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to notice, even without</a>
<a id='line_755'>design, had they then, for the first time, undertaken the task of piecing</a>
<a id='line_756'>together many self existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything in</a>
<a id='line_757'>the two great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to</a>
<a id='line_758'>an age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the</a>
<a id='line_759'>interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are</a>
<a id='line_760'>pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ,</a>
<a id='line_761'>and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus--in some cases</a>
<a id='line_762'>even by Arktinus and Hesiod--as genuine Homeric matter(29) As far as the</a>
<a id='line_763'>evidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge,</a>
<a id='line_764'>we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited</a>
<a id='line_765'>substantially as they now stand (always allowing for paitial divergences</a>
<a id='line_766'>of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of</a>
<a id='line_767'>Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the</a>
<a id='line_768'>best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of the</a>
<a id='line_769'>Homeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they thus</a>
<a id='line_770'>afford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_771'>enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation, and to</a>
<a id='line_772'>seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later</a>
<a id='line_773'>condition."(30)</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of Peisistratus</a>
<a id='line_776'>were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must confess, that I</a>
<a id='line_777'>can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours. At the same</a>
<a id='line_778'>time, so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of</a>
<a id='line_779'>these poems, in their present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am</a>
<a id='line_780'>rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that Athenian(31)</a>
<a id='line_781'>would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems,</a>
<a id='line_782'>rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful</a>
<a id='line_783'>hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the</a>
<a id='line_784'>poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the</a>
<a id='line_785'>time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read,</a>
<a id='line_786'>the less satisfied we are upon either subject.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the</a>
<a id='line_789'>preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of</a>
<a id='line_790'>the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability</a>
<a id='line_791'>must be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius.</a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt, made</a>
<a id='line_794'>by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It</a>
<a id='line_795'>is as follows:--</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>    "No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common</a>
<a id='line_799'>    sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to 'discourse</a>
<a id='line_800'>    in excellent music' among them. Many of these, like those of the</a>
<a id='line_801'>    negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to</a>
<a id='line_802'>    events passing around them. But what was passing around them? The</a>
<a id='line_803'>    grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to</a>
<a id='line_804'>    impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had</a>
<a id='line_805'>    done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was</a>
<a id='line_806'>    deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly</a>
<a id='line_807'>    in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the</a>
<a id='line_808'>    beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an</a>
<a id='line_809'>    intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with</a>
<a id='line_810'>    an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory</a>
<a id='line_811'>    considerably.</a>
<a id='line_812'></a>
<a id='line_813'>    "It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war,</a>
<a id='line_814'>    that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides,</a>
<a id='line_815'>    but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be</a>
<a id='line_816'>    made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the</a>
<a id='line_817'>    social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published</a>
<a id='line_818'>    these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now</a>
<a id='line_819'>    exists, under the title of the 'Odyssea.' The author, however, did</a>
<a id='line_820'>    not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great</a>
<a id='line_821'>    part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which</a>
<a id='line_822'>    tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the</a>
<a id='line_823'>    poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of</a>
<a id='line_824'>    his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of</a>
<a id='line_825'>    other people's ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing</a>
<a id='line_826'>    for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet might have re-cast</a>
<a id='line_827'>    pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no</a>
<a id='line_828'>    mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.'</a>
<a id='line_829'></a>
<a id='line_830'>    "While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a</a>
<a id='line_831'>    ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble</a>
<a id='line_832'>    mind seized the hint that there presented itself, and the</a>
<a id='line_833'>    Achilleis(32) grew under his hand. Unity of design, however,</a>
<a id='line_834'>    caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his</a>
<a id='line_835'>    former work: and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were</a>
<a id='line_836'>    joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into a chronicle</a>
<a id='line_837'>    history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the poem was</a>
<a id='line_838'>    destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first,</a>
<a id='line_839'>    the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and</a>
<a id='line_840'>    corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the</a>
<a id='line_841'>    streets, assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then</a>
<a id='line_842'>    Peisistratus, and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the</a>
<a id='line_843'>    poems, and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their</a>
<a id='line_844'>    original integrity in a great measure."(33)</a>
<a id='line_845'></a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have</a>
<a id='line_848'>developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I must</a>
<a id='line_849'>still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the</a>
<a id='line_850'>Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure</a>
<a id='line_851'>them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there</a>
<a id='line_852'>have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist,</a>
<a id='line_853'>would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a higher</a>
<a id='line_854'>criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or enjoy</a>
<a id='line_855'>these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one</a>
<a id='line_856'>author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari eum jus</a>
<a id='line_857'>fasque sit,_ I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of historical</a>
<a id='line_858'>evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to</a>
<a id='line_859'>a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that</a>
<a id='line_860'>which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul,</a>
<a id='line_861'>also speaks eloquently to the contrary.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed,</a>
<a id='line_864'>considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt would</a>
<a id='line_865'>be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its importance in a</a>
<a id='line_866'>philological view, I am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic</a>
<a id='line_867'>value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the emendations made upon</a>
<a id='line_868'>poets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been suggested to the</a>
<a id='line_869'>author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he would probably have adopted.</a>
<a id='line_870'>Moreover, those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal</a>
<a id='line_871'>criticism and interpretation, are often least competent to carry out their</a>
<a id='line_872'>own precepts. Grammarians are not poets by profession, but may be so _per</a>
<a id='line_873'>accidens._ I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer,</a>
<a id='line_874'>calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a</a>
<a id='line_875'>mass of remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history</a>
<a id='line_876'>of a thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be</a>
<a id='line_877'>gloomy and jejune.</a>
<a id='line_878'></a>
<a id='line_879'>But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will</a>
<a id='line_880'>exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an</a>
<a id='line_881'>heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously</a>
<a id='line_882'>dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the</a>
<a id='line_883'>pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their wish</a>
<a id='line_884'>to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book after book,</a>
<a id='line_885'>passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a collection of</a>
<a id='line_886'>fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the works of some</a>
<a id='line_887'>great man, find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up</a>
<a id='line_888'>at second hand. If we compare the theories of Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and</a>
<a id='line_889'>others, we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of</a>
<a id='line_890'>criticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer. One rejects what</a>
<a id='line_891'>another considers the turning-point of his theory. One cuts a supposed</a>
<a id='line_892'>knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a</a>
<a id='line_895'>literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to</a>
<a id='line_896'>revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to Seneca</a>
<a id='line_897'>are by _four_ different authors.(34) Now, I will venture to assert, that</a>
<a id='line_898'>these tragedies are so uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology--a</a>
<a id='line_899'>phraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were</a>
<a id='line_900'>more charmed than ourselves--in their freedom from real poetry, and last,</a>
<a id='line_901'>but not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good</a>
<a id='line_902'>taste, that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities</a>
<a id='line_903'>of the same gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but</a>
<a id='line_904'>a great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin</a>
<a id='line_905'>astonished the world with the startling announcement that the AEneid of</a>
<a id='line_906'>Virgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without</a>
<a id='line_907'>wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and</a>
<a id='line_908'>learning--nay, the refined acuteness--which scholars, like Wolf, have</a>
<a id='line_909'>bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our</a>
<a id='line_910'>modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and</a>
<a id='line_911'>entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help</a>
<a id='line_912'>thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will account for</a>
<a id='line_913'>many points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to</a>
<a id='line_914'>a period so remote from that of their first creation.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were</a>
<a id='line_917'>of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason why</a>
<a id='line_918'>corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his</a>
<a id='line_919'>day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have</a>
<a id='line_920'>given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after all, the</a>
<a id='line_921'>main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand too great a</a>
<a id='line_922'>sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals, and</a>
<a id='line_923'>which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has sought to rob</a>
<a id='line_924'>us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much violence to that</a>
<a id='line_925'>inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration</a>
<a id='line_926'>for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author of the Iliad a mere</a>
<a id='line_927'>compiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate</a>
<a id='line_928'>analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the</a>
<a id='line_929'>soul; and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus. There is</a>
<a id='line_930'>a catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of Homer. Our faith in the</a>
<a id='line_931'>author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us</a>
<a id='line_932'>a better.</a>
<a id='line_933'></a>
<a id='line_934'>While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature</a>
<a id='line_935'>herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in believing</a>
<a id='line_936'>in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed</a>
<a id='line_937'>of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination</a>
<a id='line_938'>which a host of imitators could not exhaust,--still I am far from wishing</a>
<a id='line_939'>to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of</a>
<a id='line_940'>tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive</a>
<a id='line_941'>both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to _use_ existing</a>
<a id='line_942'>romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem</a>
<a id='line_943'>itself from such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be</a>
<a id='line_944'>hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will</a>
<a id='line_945'>not be the infallible result?</a>
<a id='line_946'></a>
<a id='line_947'>A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards,</a>
<a id='line_948'>are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the</a>
<a id='line_949'>most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions--nay, even</a>
<a id='line_950'>his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the</a>
<a id='line_951'>impulses of imagination. But unless there be some grand pervading</a>
<a id='line_952'>principle--some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the</a>
<a id='line_953'>great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth. Traditions</a>
<a id='line_954'>the most picturesque, episodes the most pathetic, local associations</a>
<a id='line_955'>teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty</a>
<a id='line_956'>vision, or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the</a>
<a id='line_957'>poet; but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall</a>
<a id='line_958'>be but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but</a>
<a id='line_959'>a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each</a>
<a id='line_960'>other in their wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters,</a>
<a id='line_961'>which will require little acuteness to detect.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as</a>
<a id='line_964'>I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it</a>
<a id='line_965'>still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a</a>
<a id='line_966'>higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature intended</a>
<a id='line_967'>to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the</a>
<a id='line_968'>greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were faith no</a>
<a id='line_969'>virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on any</a>
<a id='line_970'>matter. But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as</a>
<a id='line_971'>though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the</a>
<a id='line_972'>events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity.</a>
<a id='line_973'>And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and</a>
<a id='line_974'>the good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would</a>
<a id='line_975'>allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the</a>
<a id='line_976'>giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.</a>
<a id='line_977'></a>
<a id='line_978'>Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts</a>
<a id='line_979'>even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and</a>
<a id='line_980'>with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped</a>
<a id='line_981'>in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots which mere</a>
<a id='line_982'>analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must transform</a>
<a id='line_983'>ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination must fight over</a>
<a id='line_984'>the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the same sense of injury,</a>
<a id='line_985'>as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but attain this degree of</a>
<a id='line_986'>enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of</a>
<a id='line_987'>Homer), we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only the work of one</a>
<a id='line_988'>writer, but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by</a>
<a id='line_989'>the power of song.</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their</a>
<a id='line_992'>powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who is</a>
<a id='line_993'>evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely observes:--</a>
<a id='line_994'></a>
<a id='line_995'></a>
<a id='line_996'>    "It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No</a>
<a id='line_997'>    poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his</a>
<a id='line_998'>    countrymen. Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the</a>
<a id='line_999'>    character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that</a>
<a id='line_1000'>    of the Greeks. This is a feature in their character which was not</a>
<a id='line_1001'>    wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy. When</a>
<a id='line_1002'>    lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had</a>
<a id='line_1003'>    already been accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior</a>
<a id='line_1004'>    genius. He held up before his nation the mirror, in which they</a>
<a id='line_1005'>    were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity and truth. His</a>
<a id='line_1007'>    poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature; on the</a>
<a id='line_1008'>    love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which</a>
<a id='line_1009'>    outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured</a>
<a id='line_1010'>    forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of</a>
<a id='line_1011'>    man; and therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every</a>
<a id='line_1012'>    breast which cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations</a>
<a id='line_1015'>    from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing</a>
<a id='line_1016'>    pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow;</a>
<a id='line_1017'>    if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand, of</a>
<a id='line_1018'>    elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called into</a>
<a id='line_1019'>    being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal spirit may</a>
<a id='line_1020'>    reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness."(35)</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'></a>
<a id='line_1023'>Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the "Apotheosis of</a>
<a id='line_1024'>Homer"(36) is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association,</a>
<a id='line_1025'>how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is</a>
<a id='line_1026'>lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more we</a>
<a id='line_1027'>read, and the more we think--think as becomes the readers of Homer,--the</a>
<a id='line_1028'>more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this</a>
<a id='line_1029'>rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the means of its</a>
<a id='line_1030'>preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and</a>
<a id='line_1031'>eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre</a>
<a id='line_1032'>around which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only</a>
<a id='line_1033'>equalled by their inconsistency with each other.</a>
<a id='line_1034'></a>
<a id='line_1035'>As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not</a>
<a id='line_1036'>included in Pope's translation, I will content myself with a brief account</a>
<a id='line_1037'>of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer who has done</a>
<a id='line_1038'>it full justice(37):--</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'></a>
<a id='line_1041'>    "This poem," says Coleridge, "is a short mock-heroic of ancient</a>
<a id='line_1042'>    date. The text varies in different editions, and is obviously</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    disturbed and corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    have been a juvenile essay of Homer's genius; others have</a>
<a id='line_1045'>    attributed it to the same Pigrees, mentioned above, and whose</a>
<a id='line_1046'>    reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of</a>
<a id='line_1047'>    any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain; so</a>
<a id='line_1048'>    little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies, know or</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    care about that department of criticism employed in determining</a>
<a id='line_1050'>    the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    a youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    not only of the general spirit, but of the numerous passages of</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    the Iliad itself; and even, if no such intention to parody were</a>
<a id='line_1055'>    discernible in it, the objection would still remain, that to</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of</a>
<a id='line_1057'>    poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    development of national taste, which the history of every other</a>
<a id='line_1059'>    people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society much more</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that any</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three</a>
<a id='line_1064'>    other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    with as much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    that none of them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    usage of the word deltos, "writing tablet," instead of diphthera,</a>
<a id='line_1068'>    "skin," which, according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this poem</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that the</a>
<a id='line_1071'>    familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong argument against</a>
<a id='line_1072'>    so ancient a date for its composition."</a>
<a id='line_1073'></a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's design,</a>
<a id='line_1076'>I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my own</a>
<a id='line_1077'>purpose in the present edition.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his</a>
<a id='line_1080'>earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby. It</a>
<a id='line_1081'>is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a</a>
<a id='line_1082'>disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive</a>
<a id='line_1083'>deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his whole</a>
<a id='line_1084'>work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a</a>
<a id='line_1085'>translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which</a>
<a id='line_1086'>prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments</a>
<a id='line_1087'>were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that</a>
<a id='line_1088'>these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions</a>
<a id='line_1089'>already existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the</a>
<a id='line_1090'>original. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less</a>
<a id='line_1091'>cultivated than at present. If something like the general sense could be</a>
<a id='line_1092'>decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of</a>
<a id='line_1093'>metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a</a>
<a id='line_1094'>fair interpretation of the poet's meaning, his _words_ were less jealously</a>
<a id='line_1095'>sought for, and those who could read so good a poem as Pope's Iliad had</a>
<a id='line_1096'>fair reason to be satisfied.</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own</a>
<a id='line_1099'>advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at it</a>
<a id='line_1100'>as a most delightful work in itself,--a work which is as much a part of</a>
<a id='line_1101'>English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn from</a>
<a id='line_1102'>our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most</a>
<a id='line_1103'>cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because</a>
<a id='line_1104'>Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to</a>
<a id='line_1105'>amphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from us</a>
<a id='line_1106'>to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman's fine,</a>
<a id='line_1107'>bold, rough old English;--far be it from, us to hold up his translation as</a>
<a id='line_1108'>what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still dismiss Pope's</a>
<a id='line_1109'>Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must</a>
<a id='line_1110'>have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow.</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without</a>
<a id='line_1113'>pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader. Having</a>
<a id='line_1114'>some little time since translated all the works of Homer for another</a>
<a id='line_1115'>publisher, I might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter,</a>
<a id='line_1116'>sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the text. But Pope's</a>
<a id='line_1117'>version was no field for such a display; and my purpose was to touch</a>
<a id='line_1118'>briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions, to notice occasionally</a>
<a id='line_1119'>_some_ departures from the original, and to give a few parallel passages</a>
<a id='line_1120'>from our English Homer, Milton. In the latter task I cannot pretend to</a>
<a id='line_1121'>novelty, but I trust that my other annotations, while utterly disclaiming</a>
<a id='line_1122'>high scholastic views, will be found to convey as much as is wanted; at</a>
<a id='line_1123'>least, as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected</a>
<a id='line_1124'>to admit. To write a commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I</a>
<a id='line_1125'>have made Pope's translation a little more entertaining and instructive to</a>
<a id='line_1126'>a mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily</a>
<a id='line_1127'>accomplished.</a>

<a id='line_1137'>POPE'S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER</a>
<a id='line_1138'></a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any</a>
<a id='line_1141'>writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with</a>
<a id='line_1142'>him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences;</a>
<a id='line_1143'>but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a wonder if he has</a>
<a id='line_1144'>ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that</a>
<a id='line_1145'>which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that, in</a>
<a id='line_1146'>different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of</a>
<a id='line_1147'>human study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can</a>
<a id='line_1148'>never attain to this. It furnishes art with all her materials, and without</a>
<a id='line_1149'>it judgment itself can at best but "steal wisely:" for art is only like a</a>
<a id='line_1150'>prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature. Whatever</a>
<a id='line_1151'>praises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single</a>
<a id='line_1152'>beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most</a>
<a id='line_1153'>regular gardens, art can only reduce beauties of nature to more</a>
<a id='line_1154'>regularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in,</a>
<a id='line_1155'>and is, therefore, more entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why</a>
<a id='line_1156'>common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to</a>
<a id='line_1157'>a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves</a>
<a id='line_1158'>to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art,</a>
<a id='line_1159'>than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the</a>
<a id='line_1162'>beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the</a>
<a id='line_1163'>number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery, which</a>
<a id='line_1164'>contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those</a>
<a id='line_1165'>who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according</a>
<a id='line_1166'>to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant</a>
<a id='line_1167'>it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to</a>
<a id='line_1168'>perfection or maturity, it is only because they are overrun and oppressed</a>
<a id='line_1169'>by those of a stronger nature.</a>
<a id='line_1170'></a>
<a id='line_1171'>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that</a>
<a id='line_1172'>unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no man of</a>
<a id='line_1173'>a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him. What he</a>
<a id='line_1174'>writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every</a>
<a id='line_1175'>thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called, or a battle</a>
<a id='line_1176'>fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a</a>
<a id='line_1177'>third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the</a>
<a id='line_1178'>poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a</a>
<a id='line_1179'>spectator. The course of his verses resembles that of the army he</a>
<a id='line_1180'>describes,</a>

<a id='line_1184'>"They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it." It</a>
<a id='line_1185'>is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is</a>
<a id='line_1186'>not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest</a>
<a id='line_1187'>splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and</a>
<a id='line_1188'>becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact</a>
<a id='line_1189'>disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have</a>
<a id='line_1190'>been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this "vivida vis animi,"</a>
<a id='line_1191'>in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected,</a>
<a id='line_1192'>this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove.</a>
<a id='line_1193'>Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens</a>
<a id='line_1194'>all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. This</a>
<a id='line_1195'>fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected</a>
<a id='line_1196'>from Homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant:</a>
<a id='line_1197'>in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted</a>
<a id='line_1198'>flashes: In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour</a>
<a id='line_1199'>by the force of art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an</a>
<a id='line_1200'>accidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns</a>
<a id='line_1201'>everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly.</a>
<a id='line_1202'></a>
<a id='line_1203'>I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a</a>
<a id='line_1204'>manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts</a>
<a id='line_1205'>of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which</a>
<a id='line_1206'>distinguishes him from all other authors.</a>
<a id='line_1207'></a>
<a id='line_1208'>This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the</a>
<a id='line_1209'>violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not</a>
<a id='line_1210'>enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of</a>
<a id='line_1211'>nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and</a>
<a id='line_1212'>affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the outward</a>
<a id='line_1213'>forms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler</a>
<a id='line_1214'>sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his</a>
<a id='line_1215'>imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable.</a>
<a id='line_1216'>That which Aristotle calls "the soul of poetry," was first breathed into</a>
<a id='line_1217'>it by Homer, I shall begin with considering him in his part, as it is</a>
<a id='line_1218'>naturally the first; and I speak of it both as it means the design of a</a>
<a id='line_1219'>poem, and as it is taken for fiction.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the</a>
<a id='line_1222'>marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though</a>
<a id='line_1223'>they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such</a>
<a id='line_1224'>as, though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and manner</a>
<a id='line_1225'>of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, "The</a>
<a id='line_1226'>return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy," or the like.</a>
<a id='line_1227'>That of the Iliad is the "anger of Achilles," the most short and single</a>
<a id='line_1228'>subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a</a>
<a id='line_1229'>vaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number</a>
<a id='line_1230'>of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be</a>
<a id='line_1231'>found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and</a>
<a id='line_1232'>irregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and</a>
<a id='line_1233'>its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of</a>
<a id='line_1234'>so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as</a>
<a id='line_1235'>well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both</a>
<a id='line_1236'>Homer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his.</a>
<a id='line_1237'>The other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it</a>
<a id='line_1238'>so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of</a>
<a id='line_1239'>action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is</a>
<a id='line_1240'>it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his</a>
<a id='line_1241'>invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of story.</a>
<a id='line_1242'>If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their</a>
<a id='line_1243'>forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil</a>
<a id='line_1244'>has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroys</a>
<a id='line_1245'>the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the</a>
<a id='line_1246'>shades, the AEneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If he</a>
<a id='line_1247'>be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so is AEneas by</a>
<a id='line_1248'>Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on the</a>
<a id='line_1249'>score of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just</a>
<a id='line_1250'>as long on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial</a>
<a id='line_1251'>armour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not</a>
<a id='line_1252'>only observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>way, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon,</a>
<a id='line_1254'>and the taking of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word</a>
<a id='line_1255'>from Pisander, as the loves of Dido and AEneas are taken from those of</a>
<a id='line_1256'>Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</a>
<a id='line_1257'></a>
<a id='line_1258'>To proceed to the allegorical fable--If we reflect upon those innumerable</a>
<a id='line_1259'>knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is</a>
<a id='line_1260'>generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new and</a>
<a id='line_1261'>ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us! How fertile will</a>
<a id='line_1262'>that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the properties of</a>
<a id='line_1263'>elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms</a>
<a id='line_1264'>and persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of</a>
<a id='line_1265'>the things they shadowed! This is a field in which no succeeding poets</a>
<a id='line_1266'>could dispute with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed</a>
<a id='line_1267'>them on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged</a>
<a id='line_1268'>his circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the</a>
<a id='line_1269'>mode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered</a>
<a id='line_1270'>in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets</a>
<a id='line_1271'>to lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was</a>
<a id='line_1272'>no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that</a>
<a id='line_1273'>demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing</a>
<a id='line_1274'>all those allegorical parts of a poem.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems the</a>
<a id='line_1279'>first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a</a>
<a id='line_1280'>one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find those</a>
<a id='line_1281'>authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,</a>
<a id='line_1282'>constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support of</a>
<a id='line_1283'>it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a</a>
<a id='line_1284'>philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that</a>
<a id='line_1285'>mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able</a>
<a id='line_1286'>to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set: every</a>
<a id='line_1287'>attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various</a>
<a id='line_1288'>changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day the gods of</a>
<a id='line_1289'>poetry.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no</a>
<a id='line_1292'>author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety,</a>
<a id='line_1293'>or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has</a>
<a id='line_1294'>something so singularly his own, that no painter could have distinguished</a>
<a id='line_1295'>them more by their features, than the poet has by their manners. Nothing</a>
<a id='line_1296'>can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different</a>
<a id='line_1297'>degrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfully</a>
<a id='line_1298'>diversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is</a>
<a id='line_1299'>furious and intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice,</a>
<a id='line_1300'>and subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of</a>
<a id='line_1301'>Hector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by</a>
<a id='line_1302'>love of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and</a>
<a id='line_1303'>tenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in</a>
<a id='line_1304'>Sarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing</a>
<a id='line_1305'>diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the</a>
<a id='line_1306'>main of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he</a>
<a id='line_1307'>takes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main</a>
<a id='line_1308'>characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct</a>
<a id='line_1309'>in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other</a>
<a id='line_1310'>natural, open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage;</a>
<a id='line_1311'>and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference</a>
<a id='line_1312'>of his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other</a>
<a id='line_1313'>upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds.</a>
<a id='line_1314'>The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner;</a>
<a id='line_1315'>they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they</a>
<a id='line_1316'>are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer.</a>
<a id='line_1317'>His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way</a>
<a id='line_1318'>peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that</a>
<a id='line_1319'>differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or</a>
<a id='line_1320'>the rest, In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an</a>
<a id='line_1321'>air of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage</a>
<a id='line_1322'>courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &c. They have a</a>
<a id='line_1323'>parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I</a>
<a id='line_1324'>believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he will</a>
<a id='line_1325'>pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced how</a>
<a id='line_1326'>infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that of</a>
<a id='line_1327'>all others.</a>
<a id='line_1328'></a>
<a id='line_1329'>The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters; being</a>
<a id='line_1330'>perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those</a>
<a id='line_1331'>who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so</a>
<a id='line_1332'>there is of speeches, than in any other poem. "Everything in it has</a>
<a id='line_1333'>manner" (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is acted or</a>
<a id='line_1334'>spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a</a>
<a id='line_1335'>number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part is</a>
<a id='line_1336'>less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist of</a>
<a id='line_1337'>general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any</a>
<a id='line_1338'>person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have no</a>
<a id='line_1339'>apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape being applied and</a>
<a id='line_1340'>judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of the author himself</a>
<a id='line_1341'>when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer, all which are the</a>
<a id='line_1342'>effects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action</a>
<a id='line_1343'>described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.</a>
<a id='line_1344'></a>
<a id='line_1345'>If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same</a>
<a id='line_1346'>presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_1347'>Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally</a>
<a id='line_1348'>excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence</a>
<a id='line_1349'>of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity</a>
<a id='line_1350'>with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has</a>
<a id='line_1351'>collected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with justice an</a>
<a id='line_1352'>excellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts</a>
<a id='line_1353'>that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble;</a>
<a id='line_1354'>and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments</a>
<a id='line_1355'>where he is not fired by the Iliad.</a>
<a id='line_1356'></a>
<a id='line_1357'>If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the</a>
<a id='line_1358'>invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast</a>
<a id='line_1359'>comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of</a>
<a id='line_1360'>art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and</a>
<a id='line_1361'>fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various views</a>
<a id='line_1362'>presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to</a>
<a id='line_1363'>perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full prospects of</a>
<a id='line_1364'>things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side views, unobserved by</a>
<a id='line_1365'>any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his</a>
<a id='line_1366'>battles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with</a>
<a id='line_1367'>so vast a variety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another;</a>
<a id='line_1368'>such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same</a>
<a id='line_1369'>manner, and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above</a>
<a id='line_1370'>the last in greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not</a>
<a id='line_1371'>near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every</a>
<a id='line_1372'>one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is</a>
<a id='line_1373'>evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are</a>
<a id='line_1374'>not drawn from his master.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination</a>
<a id='line_1377'>of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him</a>
<a id='line_1378'>the father of poetical diction; the first who taught that "language of the</a>
<a id='line_1379'>gods" to men. His expression is like the colouring of some great masters,</a>
<a id='line_1380'>which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity.</a>
<a id='line_1381'>It is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with</a>
<a id='line_1382'>the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who</a>
<a id='line_1383'>had found out "living words;" there are in him more daring figures and</a>
<a id='line_1384'>metaphors than in any good author whatever. An arrow is "impatient" to be</a>
<a id='line_1385'>on the wing, a weapon "thirsts" to drink the blood of an enemy, and the</a>
<a id='line_1386'>like, yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great</a>
<a id='line_1387'>in proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the</a>
<a id='line_1388'>diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same</a>
<a id='line_1389'>degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that</a>
<a id='line_1390'>is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in the</a>
<a id='line_1391'>furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater</a>
<a id='line_1392'>clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more</a>
<a id='line_1393'>intense.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the</a>
<a id='line_1396'>compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to</a>
<a id='line_1397'>poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and</a>
<a id='line_1398'>filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in</a>
<a id='line_1399'>some measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannot</a>
<a id='line_1400'>but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (as</a>
<a id='line_1401'>he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the</a>
<a id='line_1402'>persons or things to which they were joined. We see the motion of Hector's</a>
<a id='line_1403'>plumes in the epithet Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that</a>
<a id='line_1404'>of Einosiphyllos, and so of others, which particular images could not have</a>
<a id='line_1405'>been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though but</a>
<a id='line_1406'>of a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal</a>
<a id='line_1407'>action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets</a>
<a id='line_1408'>is a short description.</a>
<a id='line_1409'></a>
<a id='line_1410'>Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a</a>
<a id='line_1411'>share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfied</a>
<a id='line_1412'>with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, but</a>
<a id='line_1413'>searched through its different dialects with this particular view, to</a>
<a id='line_1414'>beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater</a>
<a id='line_1415'>mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the</a>
<a id='line_1416'>verse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he most</a>
<a id='line_1417'>affected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its never</a>
<a id='line_1418'>using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into</a>
<a id='line_1419'>two syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a more</a>
<a id='line_1420'>spreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the Attic</a>
<a id='line_1421'>contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler AEolic, which often</a>
<a id='line_1422'>rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this variety</a>
<a id='line_1423'>by altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus his measures,</a>
<a id='line_1424'>instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run</a>
<a id='line_1425'>along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further</a>
<a id='line_1426'>representation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to</a>
<a id='line_1427'>what they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony which</a>
<a id='line_1428'>makes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear in</a>
<a id='line_1429'>the world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the</a>
<a id='line_1430'>tune of his verses, even without understanding them (with the same sort of</a>
<a id='line_1431'>diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will</a>
<a id='line_1432'>find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other</a>
<a id='line_1433'>language of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to</a>
<a id='line_1434'>be copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to</a>
<a id='line_1435'>ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some</a>
<a id='line_1436'>advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and</a>
<a id='line_1437'>cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.</a>
<a id='line_1438'>Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working</a>
<a id='line_1439'>up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of,</a>
<a id='line_1440'>and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his line to a</a>
<a id='line_1441'>beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so</a>
<a id='line_1442'>frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is,</a>
<a id='line_1443'>that fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysius</a>
<a id='line_1444'>of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this</a>
<a id='line_1445'>kind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices at present</a>
<a id='line_1446'>to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make</a>
<a id='line_1447'>one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the</a>
<a id='line_1448'>Muses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting</a>
<a id='line_1449'>vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They</a>
<a id='line_1450'>roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while</a>
<a id='line_1451'>we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most</a>
<a id='line_1452'>smooth imaginable.</a>
<a id='line_1453'></a>
<a id='line_1454'>Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is</a>
<a id='line_1455'>his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of his</a>
<a id='line_1456'>work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and</a>
<a id='line_1457'>copious than any other, his manners more lively and strongly marked, his</a>
<a id='line_1458'>speeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and</a>
<a id='line_1459'>sublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, his</a>
<a id='line_1460'>expression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various.</a>
<a id='line_1461'>I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of these</a>
<a id='line_1462'>heads, I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurd</a>
<a id='line_1463'>or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an</a>
<a id='line_1464'>opposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from</a>
<a id='line_1465'>thence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge</a>
<a id='line_1466'>of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in</a>
<a id='line_1467'>that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that we</a>
<a id='line_1468'>are to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in more</a>
<a id='line_1469'>than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in</a>
<a id='line_1470'>judgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because</a>
<a id='line_1471'>Virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention,</a>
<a id='line_1472'>because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors</a>
<a id='line_1473'>had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have</a>
<a id='line_1474'>less in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil</a>
<a id='line_1475'>the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.</a>
<a id='line_1476'>Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil</a>
<a id='line_1477'>leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous</a>
<a id='line_1478'>profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the</a>
<a id='line_1479'>Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a river</a>
<a id='line_1480'>in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold their</a>
<a id='line_1481'>battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. Homer,</a>
<a id='line_1482'>boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all before him, and shines</a>
<a id='line_1483'>more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like AEneas,</a>
<a id='line_1484'>appears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him,</a>
<a id='line_1485'>and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines,</a>
<a id='line_1486'>Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus,</a>
<a id='line_1487'>scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens: Virgil, like the same</a>
<a id='line_1488'>power in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for</a>
<a id='line_1489'>empires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.</a>
<a id='line_1490'></a>
<a id='line_1491'>But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they</a>
<a id='line_1492'>naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish</a>
<a id='line_1493'>exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may</a>
<a id='line_1494'>sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness;</a>
<a id='line_1495'>and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great</a>
<a id='line_1496'>invention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view,</a>
<a id='line_1497'>we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so</a>
<a id='line_1498'>noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so</a>
<a id='line_1501'>much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of</a>
<a id='line_1502'>probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with</a>
<a id='line_1503'>gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed</a>
<a id='line_1504'>what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles</a>
<a id='line_1505'>in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near</a>
<a id='line_1506'>extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances.</a>
<a id='line_1507'>Thus Homer has his "speaking horses;" and Virgil his "myrtles distilling</a>
<a id='line_1508'>blood;" where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy</a>
<a id='line_1509'>intervention of a deity to save the probability.</a>
<a id='line_1510'></a>
<a id='line_1511'>It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been thought</a>
<a id='line_1512'>too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen</a>
<a id='line_1513'>in nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single</a>
<a id='line_1514'>circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into</a>
<a id='line_1515'>embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not</a>
<a id='line_1516'>to overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where the</a>
<a id='line_1517'>principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the</a>
<a id='line_1518'>original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The</a>
<a id='line_1519'>same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons</a>
<a id='line_1520'>together in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so many</a>
<a id='line_1521'>various and correspondent images. The reader will easily extend this</a>
<a id='line_1522'>observation to more objections of the same kind.</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or</a>
<a id='line_1525'>narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be</a>
<a id='line_1526'>found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he</a>
<a id='line_1527'>lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods; and the</a>
<a id='line_1528'>vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a word</a>
<a id='line_1529'>of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by</a>
<a id='line_1530'>the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to</a>
<a id='line_1531'>antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,(38) "that those times and manners</a>
<a id='line_1532'>are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours." Who</a>
<a id='line_1533'>can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those</a>
<a id='line_1534'>ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of</a>
<a id='line_1535'>rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown but</a>
<a id='line_1536'>for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword,</a>
<a id='line_1537'>and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other</a>
<a id='line_1538'>side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked</a>
<a id='line_1539'>at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the</a>
<a id='line_1540'>heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that</a>
<a id='line_1541'>simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding</a>
<a id='line_1542'>monarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and</a>
<a id='line_1543'>princesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to</a>
<a id='line_1544'>reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world;</a>
<a id='line_1545'>and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in</a>
<a id='line_1546'>the perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with</a>
<a id='line_1547'>nations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost</a>
<a id='line_1548'>three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining</a>
<a id='line_1549'>themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be</a>
<a id='line_1550'>found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone</a>
<a id='line_1551'>their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their</a>
<a id='line_1552'>dislike, will become a satisfaction.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the</a>
<a id='line_1555'>same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the "far-darting Phoebus,"</a>
<a id='line_1556'>the "blue-eyed Pallas," the "swift-footed Achilles," &c., which some have</a>
<a id='line_1557'>censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those of the gods</a>
<a id='line_1558'>depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; and</a>
<a id='line_1559'>had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions</a>
<a id='line_1560'>in which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was</a>
<a id='line_1561'>a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an</a>
<a id='line_1562'>irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of</a>
<a id='line_1563'>opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such;</a>
<a id='line_1564'>for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to</a>
<a id='line_1565'>add some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents</a>
<a id='line_1566'>expressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander</a>
<a id='line_1567'>the son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c.</a>
<a id='line_1568'>Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such</a>
<a id='line_1569'>distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have</a>
<a id='line_1570'>something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold</a>
<a id='line_1571'>Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &c.</a>
<a id='line_1572'>If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the</a>
<a id='line_1573'>repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world</a>
<a id='line_1574'>into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen and</a>
<a id='line_1575'>the iron one, of "heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who fought</a>
<a id='line_1576'>at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiter</a>
<a id='line_1577'>in the islands of the blessed." Now among the divine honours which were</a>
<a id='line_1578'>paid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be</a>
<a id='line_1579'>mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be</a>
<a id='line_1580'>acceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities.</a>
<a id='line_1581'></a>
<a id='line_1582'>What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly</a>
<a id='line_1583'>deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the</a>
<a id='line_1584'>course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour</a>
<a id='line_1585'>to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise</a>
<a id='line_1586'>the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by</a>
<a id='line_1587'>the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as</a>
<a id='line_1588'>heard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoever</a>
<a id='line_1589'>compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse him</a>
<a id='line_1590'>for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when</a>
<a id='line_1591'>they prefer the fable and moral of the AEneis to those of the Iliad, for</a>
<a id='line_1592'>the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the AEneis; as that the</a>
<a id='line_1593'>hero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his</a>
<a id='line_1594'>country than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what</a>
<a id='line_1595'>he never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince</a>
<a id='line_1596'>as AEneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:</a>
<a id='line_1597'>it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others</a>
<a id='line_1598'>select those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as</a>
<a id='line_1599'>some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of</a>
<a id='line_1600'>Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and</a>
<a id='line_1601'>mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement,</a>
<a id='line_1602'>oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph</a>
<a id='line_1603'>in the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of</a>
<a id='line_1604'>Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a</a>
<a id='line_1605'>fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and</a>
<a id='line_1606'>that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great</a>
<a id='line_1607'>reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times,</a>
<a id='line_1608'>and the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of this</a>
<a id='line_1609'>principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the</a>
<a id='line_1610'>cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or</a>
<a id='line_1612'>any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual</a>
<a id='line_1613'>additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who</a>
<a id='line_1614'>yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must</a>
<a id='line_1615'>have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in his</a>
<a id='line_1616'>sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.(39)</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the</a>
<a id='line_1619'>honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the</a>
<a id='line_1620'>characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, he</a>
<a id='line_1621'>still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewer</a>
<a id='line_1622'>faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that</a>
<a id='line_1623'>warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which</a>
<a id='line_1624'>holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment. Homer not</a>
<a id='line_1625'>only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other</a>
<a id='line_1626'>arts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded</a>
<a id='line_1627'>him. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for</a>
<a id='line_1628'>contraction or regulation. He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and</a>
<a id='line_1629'>if he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted</a>
<a id='line_1630'>everything. A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from</a>
<a id='line_1631'>the most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and</a>
<a id='line_1632'>produces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure</a>
<a id='line_1633'>and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults,</a>
<a id='line_1634'>have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness</a>
<a id='line_1635'>of nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.</a>
<a id='line_1636'></a>
<a id='line_1637'>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains</a>
<a id='line_1638'>to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief</a>
<a id='line_1639'>characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such</a>
<a id='line_1640'>as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but</a>
<a id='line_1641'>by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every</a>
<a id='line_1642'>particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much</a>
<a id='line_1643'>softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first grand</a>
<a id='line_1644'>duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and for the</a>
<a id='line_1645'>rest, the diction and versification only are his proper province, since</a>
<a id='line_1646'>these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</a>
<a id='line_1647'></a>
<a id='line_1648'>It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in</a>
<a id='line_1649'>our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no</a>
<a id='line_1650'>literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior</a>
<a id='line_1651'>language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that a</a>
<a id='line_1652'>rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less</a>
<a id='line_1653'>in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern</a>
<a id='line_1654'>manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a</a>
<a id='line_1655'>light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost</a>
<a id='line_1656'>literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are</a>
<a id='line_1657'>necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>poetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there have</a>
<a id='line_1659'>not been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to</a>
<a id='line_1660'>the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope</a>
<a id='line_1661'>of raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted, that the</a>
<a id='line_1662'>fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is</a>
<a id='line_1663'>most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be</a>
<a id='line_1664'>content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without</a>
<a id='line_1665'>endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular</a>
<a id='line_1666'>place. It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and when</a>
<a id='line_1667'>poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will</a>
<a id='line_1668'>but follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty,</a>
<a id='line_1669'>let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we</a>
<a id='line_1670'>ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the</a>
<a id='line_1671'>censure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to</a>
<a id='line_1672'>have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of</a>
<a id='line_1673'>his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the</a>
<a id='line_1674'>sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of</a>
<a id='line_1675'>simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some</a>
<a id='line_1676'>sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain</a>
<a id='line_1677'>signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train,</a>
<a id='line_1678'>while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and</a>
<a id='line_1679'>equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could sooner</a>
<a id='line_1680'>pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such</a>
<a id='line_1681'>commendations, as he may gain by that character of style, which his</a>
<a id='line_1682'>friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world</a>
<a id='line_1683'>will call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well</a>
<a id='line_1684'>as a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the air</a>
<a id='line_1685'>of a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between</a>
<a id='line_1687'>ostentation and rusticity.</a>
<a id='line_1688'></a>
<a id='line_1689'>This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the</a>
<a id='line_1690'>Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired</a>
<a id='line_1691'>writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were</a>
<a id='line_1692'>intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of the</a>
<a id='line_1693'>world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of</a>
<a id='line_1694'>course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any</a>
<a id='line_1695'>other writer. This consideration (together with what has been observed of</a>
<a id='line_1696'>the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator, on</a>
<a id='line_1697'>the one hand, to give in to several of those general phrases and manners</a>
<a id='line_1698'>of expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from</a>
<a id='line_1699'>being used in the Old Testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which</a>
<a id='line_1700'>have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consigned to</a>
<a id='line_1701'>mystery and religion.</a>
<a id='line_1702'></a>
<a id='line_1703'>For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care</a>
<a id='line_1704'>should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and</a>
<a id='line_1705'>proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have</a>
<a id='line_1706'>something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned gravity</a>
<a id='line_1707'>and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be</a>
<a id='line_1708'>utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious</a>
<a id='line_1709'>(that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of</a>
<a id='line_1712'>Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect</a>
<a id='line_1713'>in a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to</a>
<a id='line_1714'>require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of modern terms</a>
<a id='line_1715'>of war and government, such as "platoon, campaign, junto," or the like,</a>
<a id='line_1716'>(into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be allowable;</a>
<a id='line_1717'>those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects</a>
<a id='line_1718'>in any living language.</a>
<a id='line_1719'></a>
<a id='line_1720'>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction, which are a sort of marks</a>
<a id='line_1721'>or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight; those</a>
<a id='line_1722'>who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who</a>
<a id='line_1723'>are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I speak of his compound</a>
<a id='line_1724'>epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done</a>
<a id='line_1725'>literally into English without destroying the purity of our language. I</a>
<a id='line_1726'>believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an</a>
<a id='line_1727'>English compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of</a>
<a id='line_1728'>composition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the</a>
<a id='line_1729'>authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of</a>
<a id='line_1730'>them; such as "the cloud-compelling Jove," &c. As for the rest, whenever</a>
<a id='line_1731'>any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a</a>
<a id='line_1732'>compounded one, the course to be taken is obvious.</a>
<a id='line_1733'></a>
<a id='line_1734'>Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or</a>
<a id='line_1735'>two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet</a>
<a id='line_1736'>einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated</a>
<a id='line_1737'>literally "leaf-shaking," but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis:</a>
<a id='line_1738'>"the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods." Others that admit of</a>
<a id='line_1739'>different significations, may receive an advantage from a judicious</a>
<a id='line_1740'>variation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced. For</a>
<a id='line_1741'>example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or "far-shooting," is capable</a>
<a id='line_1742'>of two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the</a>
<a id='line_1743'>ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the</a>
<a id='line_1744'>sun; therefore, in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in</a>
<a id='line_1745'>person, I would use the former interpretation; and where the effects of</a>
<a id='line_1746'>the sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole,</a>
<a id='line_1747'>it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same</a>
<a id='line_1748'>epithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be</a>
<a id='line_1749'>accommodated (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by</a>
<a id='line_1750'>no means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them,</a>
<a id='line_1751'>where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they</a>
<a id='line_1752'>are employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show</a>
<a id='line_1753'>his fancy and his judgment.</a>
<a id='line_1754'></a>
<a id='line_1755'>As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole</a>
<a id='line_1756'>narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or</a>
<a id='line_1757'>hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as</a>
<a id='line_1758'>neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to</a>
<a id='line_1759'>offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungraceful</a>
<a id='line_1760'>in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of</a>
<a id='line_1761'>insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from</a>
<a id='line_1762'>higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial</a>
<a id='line_1763'>of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or</a>
<a id='line_1764'>the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is, to be guided by the</a>
<a id='line_1765'>nearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the</a>
<a id='line_1766'>original: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but it</a>
<a id='line_1767'>is a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any:</a>
<a id='line_1768'>if they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.</a>
<a id='line_1769'></a>
<a id='line_1770'>It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said) is</a>
<a id='line_1771'>perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new</a>
<a id='line_1772'>subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and</a>
<a id='line_1773'>attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek,</a>
<a id='line_1774'>and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by</a>
<a id='line_1775'>chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image: however,</a>
<a id='line_1776'>it may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it so</a>
<a id='line_1777'>manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few readers have</a>
<a id='line_1778'>the ear to be judges of it: but those who have, will see I have</a>
<a id='line_1779'>endeavoured at this beauty.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice</a>
<a id='line_1782'>to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain</a>
<a id='line_1783'>without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any</a>
<a id='line_1784'>entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman,</a>
<a id='line_1785'>Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable</a>
<a id='line_1786'>length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase</a>
<a id='line_1787'>more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four</a>
<a id='line_1788'>or six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey,</a>
<a id='line_1789'>ver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistaken</a>
<a id='line_1790'>in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he</a>
<a id='line_1791'>did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles.</a>
<a id='line_1792'>He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out</a>
<a id='line_1793'>of his author; insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of</a>
<a id='line_1794'>the mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to</a>
<a id='line_1795'>strain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in</a>
<a id='line_1796'>fustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as</a>
<a id='line_1797'>in the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man</a>
<a id='line_1798'>may account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface</a>
<a id='line_1799'>and remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in</a>
<a id='line_1800'>poetry. His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than</a>
<a id='line_1801'>fifteen weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But</a>
<a id='line_1802'>that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover</a>
<a id='line_1803'>his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which</a>
<a id='line_1804'>is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ</a>
<a id='line_1805'>before he arrived at years of discretion.</a>
<a id='line_1806'></a>
<a id='line_1807'>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for</a>
<a id='line_1808'>particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often omits</a>
<a id='line_1809'>the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt</a>
<a id='line_1810'>not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which</a>
<a id='line_1811'>proceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the</a>
<a id='line_1812'>contractions above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and</a>
<a id='line_1813'>sentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of</a>
<a id='line_1814'>his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness. His poetry, as</a>
<a id='line_1815'>well as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.</a>
<a id='line_1816'></a>
<a id='line_1817'>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to</a>
<a id='line_1818'>translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small part</a>
<a id='line_1819'>of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the</a>
<a id='line_1820'>sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of</a>
<a id='line_1821'>the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much regard</a>
<a id='line_1822'>to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed</a>
<a id='line_1823'>him in passages where he wanders from the original. However, had he</a>
<a id='line_1824'>translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him</a>
<a id='line_1825'>than Virgil: his version of whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is</a>
<a id='line_1826'>the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language. But the</a>
<a id='line_1827'>fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers: though they are</a>
<a id='line_1828'>confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied</a>
<a id='line_1829'>and calumniated only for being at the head of it.</a>
<a id='line_1830'></a>
<a id='line_1831'>That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who</a>
<a id='line_1832'>translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire</a>
<a id='line_1833'>which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can</a>
<a id='line_1834'>bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most</a>
<a id='line_1835'>agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his</a>
<a id='line_1836'>style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the</a>
<a id='line_1837'>more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more</a>
<a id='line_1838'>sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness</a>
<a id='line_1839'>and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect</a>
<a id='line_1840'>even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very</a>
<a id='line_1841'>cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of</a>
<a id='line_1842'>antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass</a>
<a id='line_1843'>than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved</a>
<a id='line_1844'>either the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to him is, to</a>
<a id='line_1845'>study his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how</a>
<a id='line_1846'>learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the</a>
<a id='line_1847'>world; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the</a>
<a id='line_1848'>ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the</a>
<a id='line_1849'>Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the</a>
<a id='line_1850'>spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the Epic</a>
<a id='line_1851'>Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all, with</a>
<a id='line_1852'>whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness</a>
<a id='line_1853'>he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only</a>
<a id='line_1854'>who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning. For to satisfy</a>
<a id='line_1855'>such a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere</a>
<a id='line_1856'>modern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that</a>
<a id='line_1857'>is not Greek.</a>
<a id='line_1858'></a>
<a id='line_1859'>What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am</a>
<a id='line_1860'>prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,</a>
<a id='line_1862'>whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they</a>
<a id='line_1863'>are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in</a>
<a id='line_1864'>this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons</a>
<a id='line_1865'>for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be true, that</a>
<a id='line_1866'>the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr.</a>
<a id='line_1867'>Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task;</a>
<a id='line_1868'>who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I</a>
<a id='line_1869'>cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a</a>
<a id='line_1870'>very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift</a>
<a id='line_1871'>promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his</a>
<a id='line_1872'>friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never</a>
<a id='line_1873'>knew wanting on any occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite</a>
<a id='line_1874'>pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_1875'>Congreve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. I</a>
<a id='line_1876'>must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a</a>
<a id='line_1877'>further opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good nature (to</a>
<a id='line_1878'>give it a great panegyric), is no less extensive than his learning. The</a>
<a id='line_1879'>favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them</a>
<a id='line_1880'>so true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the</a>
<a id='line_1881'>great have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my</a>
<a id='line_1882'>subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning</a>
<a id='line_1883'>as my chief encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to</a>
<a id='line_1884'>find, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to</a>
<a id='line_1885'>the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased</a>
<a id='line_1886'>I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent</a>
<a id='line_1887'>Essay), so complete a praise:</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>  "Read Homer once, and you can read no more;</a>
<a id='line_1890'>  For all books else appear so mean, so poor,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>  Verse will seem prose: but still persist to read,</a>
<a id='line_1892'>  And Homer will be all the books you need."</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is</a>
<a id='line_1895'>hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to</a>
<a id='line_1896'>his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke,</a>
<a id='line_1897'>not more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the</a>
<a id='line_1898'>useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the</a>
<a id='line_1899'>critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble</a>
<a id='line_1900'>author of the tragedy of "Heroic Love" has continued his partiality to me,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself</a>
<a id='line_1902'>the pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their</a>
<a id='line_1903'>advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several</a>
<a id='line_1904'>particulars of this translation.</a>
<a id='line_1905'></a>
<a id='line_1906'>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the</a>
<a id='line_1907'>Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one</a>
<a id='line_1908'>generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of</a>
<a id='line_1909'>them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my desire</a>
<a id='line_1910'>of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair. The</a>
<a id='line_1911'>particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave</a>
<a id='line_1912'>me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship. I must</a>
<a id='line_1913'>attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends: to whom</a>
<a id='line_1914'>all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a</a>
<a id='line_1915'>familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men</a>
<a id='line_1916'>of their turn than by my silence.</a>
<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would have</a>
<a id='line_1919'>thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been</a>
<a id='line_1920'>shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I can hardly</a>
<a id='line_1921'>envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when I reflect on</a>
<a id='line_1922'>the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships,</a>
<a id='line_1923'>which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is the more to be</a>
<a id='line_1924'>acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the</a>
<a id='line_1925'>prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of particular men.</a>
<a id='line_1926'>Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in</a>
<a id='line_1927'>which I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of</a>
<a id='line_1928'>merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are</a>
<a id='line_1929'>generally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly</a>
<a id='line_1930'>unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.</a>

<a id='line_1947'></a>
<a id='line_1948'>THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</a>
<a id='line_1949'></a>
<a id='line_1950'>In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring</a>
<a id='line_1951'>towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and Briseis,</a>
<a id='line_1952'>allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses, the</a>
<a id='line_1953'>father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to</a>
<a id='line_1954'>ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of</a>
<a id='line_1955'>the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by</a>
<a id='line_1956'>Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a pestilence</a>
<a id='line_1957'>on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare</a>
<a id='line_1958'>the cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis. The king,</a>
<a id='line_1959'>being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with</a>
<a id='line_1960'>Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command</a>
<a id='line_1961'>of the army, he seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent</a>
<a id='line_1962'>withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and</a>
<a id='line_1963'>complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of</a>
<a id='line_1964'>the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter,</a>
<a id='line_1965'>granting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till</a>
<a id='line_1966'>they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the</a>
<a id='line_1969'>plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for</a>
<a id='line_1970'>Jupiter's stay with the AEthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her</a>
<a id='line_1971'>petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and</a>
<a id='line_1972'>lastly to Olympus.</a>
<a id='line_1973'></a>
<a id='line_1974'>  Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!</a>

<a id='line_1977'>  The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;</a>
<a id='line_1978'>  Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,</a>
<a id='line_1979'>  Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.(41)</a>
<a id='line_1980'>  Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,</a>
<a id='line_1981'>  Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!(42)</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>

<a id='line_1984'>  Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power</a>
<a id='line_1985'>  Latona's son a dire contagion spread,(44)</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;</a>
<a id='line_1987'>  The king of men his reverent priest defied,(45)</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  And for the king's offence the people died.</a>

<a id='line_2078'></a>
<a id='line_2079'>  He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;</a>

<a id='line_2082'>  The past, the present, and the future knew:</a>

<a id='line_2089'>  Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:</a>

<a id='line_2093'>  Instruct a monarch where his error lies;</a>
<a id='line_2094'>  For though we deem the short-lived fury past,</a>
<a id='line_2095'>  'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last."</a>
<a id='line_2096'>  To whom Pelides:--"From thy inmost soul</a>

<a id='line_2105'>  The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head."</a>
<a id='line_2106'></a>
<a id='line_2107'>  Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:</a>
<a id='line_2108'>  "Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_2109'>  But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>  Apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.</a>
<a id='line_2111'>  Nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,</a>

<a id='line_2124'>  Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,</a>
<a id='line_2125'>  And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?</a>

<a id='line_2140'>  The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,</a>
<a id='line_2141'>  So dearly valued, and so justly mine.</a>
<a id='line_2142'>  But since for common good I yield the fair,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>  My private loss let grateful Greece repair;</a>
<a id='line_2144'>  Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,</a>

<a id='line_2146'>  "Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),</a>
<a id='line_2147'>  Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!</a>
<a id='line_2148'>  Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,</a>
<a id='line_2149'>  The due reward of many a well-fought field?</a>
<a id='line_2150'></a>

<a id='line_2159'></a>

<a id='line_2389'></a>
<a id='line_2390'>  This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:</a>

<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>  Here on the monarch's speech Achilles broke,</a>
<a id='line_2402'>  And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:</a>

<a id='line_2415'></a>
<a id='line_2416'>  At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:</a>
<a id='line_2417'>  The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.</a>
<a id='line_2418'></a>
<a id='line_2419'>  Achilles with Patroclus took his way</a>

<a id='line_2435'>  And waft their grateful odours to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_2436'></a>

<a id='line_2692'>  There, far apart, and high above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_2693'>  The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds</a>

<a id='line_2695'>  Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed</a>
<a id='line_2696'>  Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.</a>
<a id='line_2697'>  "If e'er, O father of the gods! (she said)</a>

<a id='line_2867'>THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.</a>
<a id='line_2868'></a>
<a id='line_2869'>Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision</a>
<a id='line_2870'>to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in order to make</a>
<a id='line_2871'>the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who is deluded</a>
<a id='line_2872'>with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but fears the army</a>
<a id='line_2873'>was discouraged by his absence, and the late plague, as well as by the</a>
<a id='line_2874'>length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a</a>
<a id='line_2875'>stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in council,</a>
<a id='line_2876'>that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a</a>
<a id='line_2877'>stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole</a>
<a id='line_2878'>host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to</a>
<a id='line_2879'>it, and run to prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of</a>
<a id='line_2880'>Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is</a>
<a id='line_2881'>recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice</a>
<a id='line_2882'>of Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and</a>
<a id='line_2883'>to divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to</a>
<a id='line_2884'>battle. This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the</a>
<a id='line_2885'>Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.</a>
<a id='line_2886'></a>
<a id='line_2887'>The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene</a>
<a id='line_2888'>lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it</a>
<a id='line_2889'>removes to Troy.</a>
<a id='line_2890'></a>
<a id='line_2891'>  Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,</a>
<a id='line_2892'>  Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:</a>
<a id='line_2893'>  The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above;</a>
<a id='line_2894'>  All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)</a>
<a id='line_2895'>  To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,</a>
<a id='line_2896'>  And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:</a>
<a id='line_2897'>  Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>  And thus commands the vision of the night.</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>

<a id='line_2959'>  Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_2960'>  Lifts up her light, and opens day above.</a>
<a id='line_2961'>  The king despatch'd his heralds with commands</a>
<a id='line_2962'>  To range the camp and summon all the bands:</a>
<a id='line_2963'>  The gathering hosts the monarch's word obey;</a>
<a id='line_2964'>  While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.</a>
<a id='line_2965'>  In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;</a>
<a id='line_2966'>  There calls a senate of the peers around:</a>
<a id='line_2967'>  The assembly placed, the king of men express'd</a>
<a id='line_2968'>  The counsels labouring in his artful breast.</a>
<a id='line_2969'></a>
<a id='line_2970'>  "Friends and confederates! with attentive ear</a>
<a id='line_2971'>  Receive my words, and credit what you hear.</a>
<a id='line_2972'>  Late as I slumber'd in the shades of night,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>  A dream divine appear'd before my sight;</a>
<a id='line_2974'>  Whose visionary form like Nestor came,</a>
<a id='line_2975'>  The same in habit, and in mien the same.(80)</a>
<a id='line_2976'>  The heavenly phantom hover'd o'er my head,</a>
<a id='line_2977'>  'And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus' son? (he said)</a>
<a id='line_2978'>  Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,</a>
<a id='line_2979'>  Directs in council, and in war presides;</a>
<a id='line_2980'>  To whom its safety a whole people owes,</a>
<a id='line_2981'>  To waste long nights in indolent repose.</a>
<a id='line_2982'>  Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,</a>
<a id='line_2983'>  Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.</a>
<a id='line_2984'>  In just array draw forth the embattled train,</a>
<a id='line_2985'>  And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;</a>
<a id='line_2986'>  E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy</a>
<a id='line_2987'>  The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.</a>
<a id='line_2988'>  For now no more the gods with fate contend,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>  At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.</a>
<a id='line_2990'>  Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,</a>
<a id='line_2991'>  And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>  This hear observant, and the gods obey!'</a>
<a id='line_2994'>  The vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.</a>
<a id='line_2995'>  Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,</a>
<a id='line_2996'>  Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.</a>
<a id='line_2997'>  But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,</a>
<a id='line_2998'>  Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.</a>
<a id='line_2999'>  To move the troops to measure back the main,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>  Be mine; and yours the province to detain."</a>
<a id='line_3001'></a>
<a id='line_3002'>  He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,</a>
<a id='line_3003'>  (Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,)</a>
<a id='line_3004'>  "Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,</a>
<a id='line_3005'>  Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;</a>
<a id='line_3006'>  Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host,</a>
<a id='line_3007'>  Forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!</a>
<a id='line_3008'>  Then let us haste, obey the god's alarms,</a>
<a id='line_3009'>  And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms."</a>
<a id='line_3010'></a>
<a id='line_3011'>  Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay</a>
<a id='line_3012'>  Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:</a>
<a id='line_3013'>  The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,</a>
<a id='line_3014'>  Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.</a>
<a id='line_3015'>  As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees</a>
<a id='line_3016'>  Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,</a>
<a id='line_3017'>  Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,</a>
<a id='line_3018'>  With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;</a>
<a id='line_3019'>  Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,</a>
<a id='line_3020'>  And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.(81)</a>
<a id='line_3021'>  So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train</a>
<a id='line_3022'>  Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:</a>
<a id='line_3023'>  Along the region runs a deafening sound;</a>
<a id='line_3024'>  Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.</a>
<a id='line_3025'>  Fame flies before the messenger of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_3026'>  And shining soars, and claps her wings above.</a>
<a id='line_3027'>  Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud(82)</a>
<a id='line_3028'>  The monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.</a>
<a id='line_3029'>  Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,</a>
<a id='line_3030'>  And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,</a>
<a id='line_3031'>  The king of kings his awful figure raised:</a>
<a id='line_3032'>  High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;</a>
<a id='line_3033'>  The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,</a>
<a id='line_3034'>  By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.</a>
<a id='line_3035'>  To Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;</a>
<a id='line_3036'>  The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,</a>
<a id='line_3037'>  In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,</a>
<a id='line_3038'>  To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;</a>
<a id='line_3039'>  And now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,</a>
<a id='line_3040'>  Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.(83)</a>
<a id='line_3041'></a>
<a id='line_3042'>  On this bright sceptre now the king reclined,</a>
<a id='line_3043'>  And artful thus pronounced the speech design'd:</a>
<a id='line_3044'>  "Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care,</a>
<a id='line_3045'>  Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!</a>
<a id='line_3046'>  Of partial Jove with justice I complain,</a>
<a id='line_3047'>  And heavenly oracles believed in vain</a>
<a id='line_3048'>  A safe return was promised to our toils,</a>
<a id='line_3049'>  Renown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.</a>
<a id='line_3050'>  Now shameful flight alone can save the host,</a>
<a id='line_3051'>  Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.</a>
<a id='line_3052'>  So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!</a>
<a id='line_3053'>  At whose command whole empires rise or fall:</a>
<a id='line_3054'>  He shakes the feeble props of human trust,</a>
<a id='line_3055'>  And towns and armies humbles to the dust</a>
<a id='line_3056'>  What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,</a>
<a id='line_3057'>  Oh, lasting shame in every future age!</a>
<a id='line_3058'>  Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,</a>
<a id='line_3059'>  Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.</a>
<a id='line_3060'>  So small their number, that if wars were ceased,</a>
<a id='line_3061'>  And Greece triumphant held a general feast,</a>
<a id='line_3062'>  All rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine</a>
<a id='line_3063'>  Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.(84)</a>
<a id='line_3064'>  But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_3065'>  And Troy prevails by armies not her own.</a>
<a id='line_3066'>  Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,</a>
<a id='line_3067'>  Since first the labours of this war begun:</a>
<a id='line_3068'>  Our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,</a>
<a id='line_3069'>  And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.</a>
<a id='line_3070'>  Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!</a>
<a id='line_3071'>  Our weeping wives, our tender children call:</a>
<a id='line_3072'>  Love, duty, safety, summon us away,</a>
<a id='line_3073'>  'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey,</a>
<a id='line_3074'>  Our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,</a>
<a id='line_3075'>  Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.</a>
<a id='line_3076'>  Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,</a>
<a id='line_3077'>  And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy."</a>
<a id='line_3078'></a>
<a id='line_3079'>  His deep design unknown, the hosts approve</a>
<a id='line_3080'>  Atrides' speech. The mighty numbers move.</a>
<a id='line_3081'>  So roll the billows to the Icarian shore,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>  From east and south when winds begin to roar,</a>
<a id='line_3083'>  Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep</a>
<a id='line_3084'>  The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.</a>
<a id='line_3085'>  And as on corn when western gusts descend,(85)</a>
<a id='line_3086'>  Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:</a>
<a id='line_3087'>  Thus o'er the field the moving host appears,</a>
<a id='line_3088'>  With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.</a>
<a id='line_3089'>  The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet</a>
<a id='line_3090'>  Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;</a>
<a id='line_3091'>  With long-resounding cries they urge the train</a>
<a id='line_3092'>  To fit the ships, and launch into the main.</a>
<a id='line_3093'>  They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,</a>
<a id='line_3094'>  The doubling clamours echo to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_3095'>  E'en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,</a>
<a id='line_3096'>  And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;</a>
<a id='line_3097'>  But Jove's imperial queen their flight survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_3098'>  And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:</a>
<a id='line_3099'></a>
<a id='line_3100'>  "Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!</a>
<a id='line_3101'>  And leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?</a>
<a id='line_3102'>  Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,</a>
<a id='line_3103'>  In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?</a>
<a id='line_3104'>  And bravest chiefs, in Helen's quarrel slain,</a>
<a id='line_3105'>  Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?</a>
<a id='line_3106'>  No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,</a>
<a id='line_3107'>  Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.</a>
<a id='line_3108'>  Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,</a>
<a id='line_3109'>  Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main."</a>
<a id='line_3110'></a>
<a id='line_3111'>  Pallas obeys, and from Olympus' height</a>
<a id='line_3112'>  Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.</a>
<a id='line_3113'>  Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,</a>
<a id='line_3114'>  For prudent counsel like the gods renown'd:</a>
<a id='line_3115'>  Oppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,</a>
<a id='line_3116'>  Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.</a>
<a id='line_3117'>  "And is it thus, divine Laertes' son,</a>
<a id='line_3118'>  Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),</a>
<a id='line_3119'>  Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_3120'>  And fame eternal leave to Priam's race?</a>
<a id='line_3121'>  Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,</a>
<a id='line_3122'>  Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!</a>
<a id='line_3123'>  Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>  Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.</a>
<a id='line_3125'>  Your own resistless eloquence employ,</a>
<a id='line_3126'>  And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy."</a>
<a id='line_3127'></a>
<a id='line_3128'>  The voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,</a>
<a id='line_3129'>  Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd:</a>
<a id='line_3130'>  Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand</a>
<a id='line_3131'>  Received the imperial sceptre of command.</a>
<a id='line_3132'>  Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,</a>
<a id='line_3133'>  He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;</a>
<a id='line_3134'>  Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,</a>
<a id='line_3135'>  He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.</a>
<a id='line_3136'></a>
<a id='line_3137'>  "Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,</a>
<a id='line_3138'>  By brave examples should confirm the rest.</a>
<a id='line_3139'>  The monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears;</a>
<a id='line_3140'>  He tries our courage, but resents our fears.</a>
<a id='line_3141'>  The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;</a>
<a id='line_3142'>  Not thus the king in secret council spoke.</a>
<a id='line_3143'>  Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,</a>
<a id='line_3144'>  Beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings."</a>
<a id='line_3145'></a>
<a id='line_3146'>  But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,</a>
<a id='line_3147'>  Him with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.</a>
<a id='line_3148'>  "Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;</a>
<a id='line_3149'>  Unknown alike in council and in field!</a>
<a id='line_3150'>  Ye gods, what dastards would our host command!</a>
<a id='line_3151'>  Swept to the war, the lumber of a land.</a>
<a id='line_3152'>  Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd</a>
<a id='line_3153'>  That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.</a>

<a id='line_3155'>  His are the laws, and him let all obey."(86)</a>
<a id='line_3156'></a>

<a id='line_3160'>  Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.</a>

<a id='line_3162'>  And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;</a>
<a id='line_3163'>  The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,</a>
<a id='line_3164'>  The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.</a>
<a id='line_3165'>  At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,</a>
<a id='line_3166'>  And a still silence lulls the camp to peace.</a>
<a id='line_3167'>  Thersites only clamour'd in the throng,</a>
<a id='line_3168'>  Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:</a>
<a id='line_3169'>  Awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,</a>
<a id='line_3170'>  In scandal busy, in reproaches bold:</a>
<a id='line_3171'>  With witty malice studious to defame,</a>
<a id='line_3172'>  Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:--</a>
<a id='line_3173'>  But chief he gloried with licentious style</a>

<a id='line_3175'>  His figure such as might his soul proclaim;</a>
<a id='line_3176'>  One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:</a>
<a id='line_3177'>  His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,</a>
<a id='line_3178'>  Thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.</a>
<a id='line_3179'>  Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_3180'>  And much he hated all, but most the best:</a>
<a id='line_3181'>  Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;</a>
<a id='line_3182'>  But royal scandal his delight supreme,</a>
<a id='line_3183'>  Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,</a>
<a id='line_3184'>  Vex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.</a>
<a id='line_3185'>  Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,</a>

<a id='line_3274'>  What could their wives or helpless children more?</a>
<a id='line_3275'>  What heart but melts to leave the tender train,</a>
<a id='line_3276'>  And, one short month, endure the wintry main?</a>
<a id='line_3277'>  Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,</a>

<a id='line_3281'>  Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;</a>
<a id='line_3282'>  But vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!</a>
<a id='line_3283'>  Expect the time to Troy's destruction given.</a>

<a id='line_3286'>  And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.</a>
<a id='line_3287'>  Beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised</a>
<a id='line_3288'>  Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:</a>
<a id='line_3289'>  'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,</a>
<a id='line_3290'>  The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground</a>
<a id='line_3291'>  A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;</a>
<a id='line_3292'>  From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.</a>
<a id='line_3293'>  Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_3294'>  And curl'd around in many a winding fold;</a>
<a id='line_3295'>  The topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;</a>
<a id='line_3296'>  Eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;</a>
<a id='line_3297'>  Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>  Stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;</a>
<a id='line_3299'>  While hovering near, with miserable moan,</a>
<a id='line_3300'>  The drooping mother wail'd her children gone.</a>
<a id='line_3301'>  The mother last, as round the nest she flew,</a>
<a id='line_3302'>  Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;</a>
<a id='line_3303'>  Nor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands</a>
<a id='line_3304'>  A lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.</a>
<a id='line_3305'>  Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare</a>
<a id='line_3306'>  Trust in his omen, and support the war.</a>
<a id='line_3307'>  For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3308'>  And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_3309'>  Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,(90)</a>
<a id='line_3310'>  'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.</a>
<a id='line_3311'>  This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,</a>
<a id='line_3312'>  Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.</a>
<a id='line_3313'>  As many birds as by the snake were slain,</a>
<a id='line_3314'>  So many years the toils of Greece remain;</a>
<a id='line_3315'>  But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'</a>
<a id='line_3316'>  Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.</a>
<a id='line_3317'>  Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,</a>
<a id='line_3318'>  Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate."</a>
<a id='line_3319'>  He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,</a>
<a id='line_3320'>  The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.</a>
<a id='line_3321'>  Then Nestor thus--"These vain debates forbear,</a>
<a id='line_3322'>  Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.</a>
<a id='line_3323'>  Where now are all your high resolves at last?</a>
<a id='line_3324'>  Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?</a>
<a id='line_3325'>  Vow'd with libations and with victims then,</a>
<a id='line_3326'>  Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!</a>
<a id='line_3327'>  While useless words consume the unactive hours,</a>
<a id='line_3328'>  No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.</a>
<a id='line_3329'>  Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;</a>
<a id='line_3330'>  We march to war, if thou direct the way.</a>
<a id='line_3331'>  But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,</a>
<a id='line_3332'>  The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,</a>
<a id='line_3333'>  To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,</a>
<a id='line_3334'>  And view with envy our successful wars.</a>
<a id='line_3335'>  On that great day, when first the martial train,</a>
<a id='line_3336'>  Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,</a>
<a id='line_3337'>  Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,</a>
<a id='line_3338'>  And thunder rolling shook the firmament.</a>
<a id='line_3339'>  Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,</a>
<a id='line_3340'>  Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,</a>
<a id='line_3341'>  Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear,</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.</a>
<a id='line_3343'>  Before that day, if any Greek invite</a>
<a id='line_3344'>  His country's troops to base, inglorious flight,</a>
<a id='line_3345'>  Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,</a>
<a id='line_3346'>  And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.</a>
<a id='line_3347'>  But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:(91)</a>
<a id='line_3348'>  Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.</a>
<a id='line_3349'>  Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;</a>
<a id='line_3350'>  In tribes and nations to divide thy train:</a>
<a id='line_3351'>  His separate troops let every leader call,</a>
<a id='line_3352'>  Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.</a>
<a id='line_3353'>  What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,</a>
<a id='line_3354'>  Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,</a>
<a id='line_3355'>  When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known</a>
<a id='line_3356'>  And what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;</a>
<a id='line_3357'>  If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,</a>
<a id='line_3358'>  If gods above prevent, or men below."</a>
<a id='line_3359'></a>
<a id='line_3360'>  To him the king: "How much thy years excel</a>
<a id='line_3361'>  In arts of counsel, and in speaking well!</a>
<a id='line_3362'>  O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree</a>
<a id='line_3363'>  But ten such sages as they grant in thee;</a>
<a id='line_3364'>  Such wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,</a>
<a id='line_3365'>  And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!</a>
<a id='line_3366'>  But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates</a>
<a id='line_3367'>  In fierce contention and in vain debates:</a>
<a id='line_3368'>  Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws,</a>
<a id='line_3369'>  By me provoked; a captive maid the cause:</a>
<a id='line_3370'>  If e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall</a>
<a id='line_3371'>  Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!</a>
<a id='line_3372'>  But now, ye warriors, take a short repast;</a>
<a id='line_3373'>  And, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.</a>
<a id='line_3374'>  His sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,</a>
<a id='line_3375'>  And every Grecian fix his brazen shield,</a>
<a id='line_3376'>  Let all excite the fiery steeds of war,</a>
<a id='line_3377'>  And all for combat fit the rattling car.</a>
<a id='line_3378'>  This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;</a>
<a id='line_3379'>  No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;</a>
<a id='line_3380'>  Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:</a>
<a id='line_3381'>  Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;</a>

<a id='line_3383'>  With the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,</a>
<a id='line_3384'>  Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,</a>
<a id='line_3385'>  And each spent courser at the chariot blow.</a>
<a id='line_3386'>  Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,</a>

<a id='line_3389'>  The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour."</a>
<a id='line_3390'></a>
<a id='line_3391'>  The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,</a>

<a id='line_3393'>  That dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,</a>
<a id='line_3394'>  And foam and thunder on the stony shore.</a>
<a id='line_3395'>  Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,</a>
<a id='line_3396'>  The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;</a>
<a id='line_3397'>  With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>  To avert the dangers of the doubtful day.</a>
<a id='line_3399'>  A steer of five years' age, large limb'd, and fed,(92)</a>
<a id='line_3400'>  To Jove's high altars Agamemnon led:</a>
<a id='line_3401'>  There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;</a>
<a id='line_3402'>  And Nestor first, as most advanced in years.</a>
<a id='line_3403'>  Next came Idomeneus,(93)</a>
<a id='line_3404'>  and Tydeus' son,(94)</a>
<a id='line_3405'>  Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;(95)</a>
<a id='line_3406'>  Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;</a>
<a id='line_3407'>  And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.(96)</a>
<a id='line_3408'>  The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take</a>
<a id='line_3409'>  The sacred offering of the salted cake:</a>
<a id='line_3410'>  When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;</a>
<a id='line_3411'>  "O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,</a>
<a id='line_3412'>  Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,</a>
<a id='line_3413'>  Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!</a>

<a id='line_3419'>  And slaughter'd heroes groan around their lord!"</a>
<a id='line_3420'></a>
<a id='line_3421'>  Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer</a>
<a id='line_3422'>  Great Jove refused, and toss'd in empty air:</a>
<a id='line_3423'>  The God averse, while yet the fumes arose,</a>
<a id='line_3424'>  Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.</a>
<a id='line_3425'>  Their prayers perform'd the chiefs the rite pursue,</a>
<a id='line_3426'>  The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.</a>
<a id='line_3427'>  The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,</a>
<a id='line_3428'>  The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.</a>
<a id='line_3429'>  On these, in double cauls involved with art,</a>
<a id='line_3430'>  The choicest morsels lie from every part,</a>
<a id='line_3431'>  From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire</a>
<a id='line_3432'>  While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.</a>
<a id='line_3433'>  The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd</a>
<a id='line_3434'>  The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;</a>
<a id='line_3435'>  Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</a>
<a id='line_3436'>  Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</a>
<a id='line_3437'>  Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_3438'>  The generous Nestor thus the prince address'd.</a>
<a id='line_3439'></a>
<a id='line_3440'>  "Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,</a>

<a id='line_3443'>  And lead to war when heaven directs the way."</a>
<a id='line_3444'></a>
<a id='line_3445'>  He said; the monarch issued his commands;</a>
<a id='line_3446'>  Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands</a>
<a id='line_3447'>  The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>  In tribes and nations rank'd on either side.</a>

<a id='line_3452'>  Blazed on her arm, and lighten'd all the field:</a>
<a id='line_3453'>  Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_3454'>  Form'd the bright fringe, and seem'd to burn in gold,</a>
<a id='line_3455'>  With this each Grecian's manly breast she warms,</a>
<a id='line_3456'>  Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,</a>
<a id='line_3457'>  No more they sigh, inglorious, to return,</a>
<a id='line_3458'>  But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.</a>
<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>  As on some mountain, through the lofty grove,</a>
<a id='line_3461'>  The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;</a>
<a id='line_3462'>  The fires expanding, as the winds arise,</a>
<a id='line_3463'>  Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:</a>
<a id='line_3464'>  So from the polish'd arms, and brazen shields,</a>
<a id='line_3465'>  A gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.</a>
<a id='line_3466'>  Not less their number than the embodied cranes,</a>

<a id='line_3472'>  Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,</a>
<a id='line_3473'>  The legions crowd Scamander's flowery side;(98)</a>
<a id='line_3474'>  With rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_3475'>  And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.</a>
<a id='line_3476'>  Along the river's level meads they stand,</a>
<a id='line_3477'>  Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,</a>
<a id='line_3478'>  Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,</a>
<a id='line_3479'>  The wandering nation of a summer's day:</a>
<a id='line_3480'>  That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,</a>
<a id='line_3481'>  In gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers;</a>
<a id='line_3482'>  From pail to pail with busy murmur run</a>
<a id='line_3483'>  The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_3484'>  So throng'd, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood</a>
<a id='line_3485'>  In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.</a>
<a id='line_3486'>  Each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins</a>

<a id='line_3490'>  The king of kings, majestically tall,</a>
<a id='line_3491'>  Towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all;</a>

<a id='line_3897'>  Ajax in arms the first renown acquired,</a>
<a id='line_3898'>  While stern Achilles in his wrath retired:</a>
<a id='line_3899'>  (His was the strength that mortal might exceeds,</a>
<a id='line_3900'>  And his the unrivall'd race of heavenly steeds:)</a>
<a id='line_3901'>  But Thetis' son now shines in arms no more;</a>
<a id='line_3902'>  His troops, neglected on the sandy shore.</a>
<a id='line_3903'>  In empty air their sportive javelins throw,</a>
<a id='line_3904'>  Or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow:</a>
<a id='line_3905'>  Unstain'd with blood his cover'd chariots stand;</a>
<a id='line_3906'>  The immortal coursers graze along the strand;</a>
<a id='line_3907'>  But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,</a>
<a id='line_3908'>  And, wandering o'er the camp, required their lord.</a>
<a id='line_3909'></a>
<a id='line_3910'>  Now, like a deluge, covering all around,</a>
<a id='line_3911'>  The shining armies sweep along the ground;</a>
<a id='line_3912'>  Swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise,</a>
<a id='line_3913'>  Floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_3914'>  Earth groan'd beneath them; as when angry Jove</a>
<a id='line_3915'>  Hurls down the forky lightning from above,</a>

<a id='line_3917'>  And fires Typhoeus with redoubled blows,</a>
<a id='line_3918'>  Where Typhon, press'd beneath the burning load,</a>
<a id='line_3919'>  Still feels the fury of the avenging god.</a>
<a id='line_3920'></a>
<a id='line_3921'>  But various Iris, Jove's commands to bear,</a>
<a id='line_3922'>  Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;</a>
<a id='line_3923'>  In Priam's porch the Trojan chiefs she found,</a>
<a id='line_3924'>  The old consulting, and the youths around.</a>

<a id='line_3928'>  The fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.</a>
<a id='line_3929'>  In this dissembled form, she hastes to bring</a>
<a id='line_3930'>  The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king.</a>
<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>  "Cease to consult, the time for action calls;</a>

<a id='line_4062'></a>
<a id='line_4063'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_4064'></a>
<a id='line_4065'>THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.</a>
<a id='line_4066'></a>
<a id='line_4067'>The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between</a>
<a id='line_4068'>Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the determination</a>
<a id='line_4069'>of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight. She leads her</a>
<a id='line_4070'>to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his counsellers observing the</a>
<a id='line_4071'>Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of the</a>
<a id='line_4072'>chief of them. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the</a>
<a id='line_4073'>conditions of the combat. The duel ensues; wherein Paris being overcome,</a>
<a id='line_4074'>he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his apartment.</a>
<a id='line_4075'>She then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together.</a>
<a id='line_4076'>Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians, demands the restoration of Helen,</a>
<a id='line_4077'>and the performance of the articles.</a>
<a id='line_4078'></a>
<a id='line_4079'>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The</a>
<a id='line_4080'>scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy</a>
<a id='line_4081'>itself.</a>
<a id='line_4082'></a>
<a id='line_4083'>  Thus by their leaders' care each martial band</a>
<a id='line_4084'>  Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.</a>
<a id='line_4085'>  With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,</a>
<a id='line_4086'>  Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war</a>
<a id='line_4087'>  So when inclement winters vex the plain</a>
<a id='line_4088'>  With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</a>
<a id='line_4089'>  To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,(108)</a>
<a id='line_4090'>  With noise, and order, through the midway sky;</a>
<a id='line_4091'>  To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,</a>
<a id='line_4092'>  And all the war descends upon the wing,</a>
<a id='line_4093'>  But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd(109)</a>
<a id='line_4094'>  By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,</a>
<a id='line_4095'>  Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around</a>
<a id='line_4096'>  Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.</a>
<a id='line_4097'>  Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds</a>
<a id='line_4098'>  A night of vapours round the mountain heads,</a>
<a id='line_4099'>  Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,</a>
<a id='line_4100'>  To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;</a>
<a id='line_4101'>  While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,</a>
<a id='line_4102'>  Lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day:</a>
<a id='line_4103'>  So wrapp'd in gathering dust, the Grecian train,</a>
<a id='line_4104'>  A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.</a>
<a id='line_4105'></a>
<a id='line_4106'>  Now front to front the hostile armies stand,</a>
<a id='line_4107'>  Eager of fight, and only wait command;</a>
<a id='line_4108'>  When, to the van, before the sons of fame</a>
<a id='line_4109'>  Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:</a>
<a id='line_4110'>  In form a god! the panther's speckled hide</a>
<a id='line_4111'>  Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride:</a>
<a id='line_4112'>  His bended bow across his shoulders flung,</a>
<a id='line_4113'>  His sword beside him negligently hung;</a>
<a id='line_4114'>  Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,</a>
<a id='line_4115'>  And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.</a>
<a id='line_4116'></a>
<a id='line_4117'>  As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,</a>
<a id='line_4118'>  He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_4119'>  Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,</a>
<a id='line_4120'>  With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:</a>
<a id='line_4121'>  So joys a lion, if the branching deer,</a>
<a id='line_4122'>  Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;</a>
<a id='line_4123'>  Eager he seizes and devours the slain,</a>
<a id='line_4124'>  Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.</a>
<a id='line_4125'>  Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,</a>
<a id='line_4126'>  In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground</a>
<a id='line_4127'>  From his high chariot: him, approaching near,</a>
<a id='line_4128'>  The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,</a>
<a id='line_4129'>  Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,</a>
<a id='line_4130'>  And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.</a>
<a id='line_4131'>  As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees(110)</a>
<a id='line_4132'>  Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,</a>
<a id='line_4133'>  Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright</a>
<a id='line_4134'>  And all confused precipitates his flight:</a>
<a id='line_4135'>  So from the king the shining warrior flies,</a>
<a id='line_4136'>  And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.</a>
<a id='line_4137'></a>
<a id='line_4138'>  As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,</a>
<a id='line_4139'>  He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:</a>
<a id='line_4140'>  "Unhappy Paris! but to women brave!(111)</a>
<a id='line_4141'>  So fairly form'd, and only to deceive!</a>
<a id='line_4142'>  Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw'st the light,</a>
<a id='line_4143'>  Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!</a>
<a id='line_4144'>  A better fate than vainly thus to boast,</a>
<a id='line_4145'>  And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.</a>
<a id='line_4146'>  Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see</a>
<a id='line_4147'>  Their fears of danger undeceived in thee!</a>
<a id='line_4148'>  Thy figure promised with a martial air,</a>
<a id='line_4149'>  But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.</a>
<a id='line_4150'>  In former days, in all thy gallant pride,</a>
<a id='line_4151'>  When thy tall ships triumphant stemm'd the tide,</a>
<a id='line_4152'>  When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,</a>
<a id='line_4153'>  And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,</a>
<a id='line_4154'>  Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,</a>
<a id='line_4155'>  You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,</a>
<a id='line_4156'>  Thus from her realm convey'd the beauteous prize,</a>
<a id='line_4157'>  And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen's eyes?</a>
<a id='line_4158'>  This deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_4159'>  Thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race;</a>
<a id='line_4160'>  This deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight;</a>
<a id='line_4161'>  Or hast thou injured whom thou dar'st not right?</a>
<a id='line_4162'>  Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know</a>
<a id='line_4163'>  Thou keep'st the consort of a braver foe.</a>
<a id='line_4164'>  Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,</a>
<a id='line_4165'>  Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,</a>
<a id='line_4166'>  Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,</a>
<a id='line_4167'>  When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:</a>
<a id='line_4168'>  Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow</a>
<a id='line_4169'>  Crush the dire author of his country's woe."</a>
<a id='line_4170'></a>
<a id='line_4171'>  His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:</a>
<a id='line_4172'>  "'Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:</a>
<a id='line_4173'>  But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,</a>
<a id='line_4174'>  So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?</a>
<a id='line_4175'>  Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,</a>
<a id='line_4176'>  Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,</a>
<a id='line_4177'>  Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,</a>
<a id='line_4178'>  With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.</a>
<a id='line_4179'>  Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms</a>
<a id='line_4180'>  With which a lover golden Venus arms;</a>
<a id='line_4181'>  Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,</a>
<a id='line_4182'>  No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.</a>
<a id='line_4183'>  Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,</a>
<a id='line_4184'>  The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;</a>
<a id='line_4185'>  Then let a midway space our hosts divide,</a>
<a id='line_4186'>  And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:</a>
<a id='line_4187'>  By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,</a>
<a id='line_4188'>  For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;</a>
<a id='line_4189'>  And who his rival can in arms subdue,</a>
<a id='line_4190'>  His be the fair, and his the treasure too.</a>
<a id='line_4191'>  Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,</a>
<a id='line_4192'>  And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;</a>
<a id='line_4193'>  Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,</a>
<a id='line_4194'>  Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."</a>
<a id='line_4195'></a>
<a id='line_4196'>  He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,</a>
<a id='line_4197'>  Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_4198'>  Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe</a>
<a id='line_4199'>  Advanced with steps majestically slow:</a>
<a id='line_4200'>  While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour</a>
<a id='line_4201'>  Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.</a>
<a id='line_4202'></a>
<a id='line_4203'>  Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:</a>
<a id='line_4204'>  "Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:</a>
<a id='line_4205'>  A parley Hector asks, a message bears;</a>
<a id='line_4206'>  We know him by the various plume he wears."</a>
<a id='line_4207'>  Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,</a>
<a id='line_4208'>  The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.</a>
<a id='line_4209'></a>
<a id='line_4210'>  While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes</a>
<a id='line_4211'>  On either host, and thus to both applies:</a>
<a id='line_4212'>  "Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</a>
<a id='line_4213'>  What Paris, author of the war, demands.</a>
<a id='line_4214'>  Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,</a>
<a id='line_4215'>  And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.</a>
<a id='line_4216'>  Here in the midst, in either army's sight,</a>
<a id='line_4217'>  He dares the Spartan king to single fight;</a>
<a id='line_4218'>  And wills that Helen and the ravish'd spoil,</a>
<a id='line_4219'>  That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.</a>
<a id='line_4220'>  Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,</a>
<a id='line_4221'>  And different nations part in leagues of peace."</a>
<a id='line_4222'></a>
<a id='line_4223'>  He spoke: in still suspense on either side</a>
<a id='line_4224'>  Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:</a>
<a id='line_4225'></a>
<a id='line_4226'>  "Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right</a>
<a id='line_4227'>  A world engages in the toils of fight.</a>
<a id='line_4228'>  To me the labour of the field resign;</a>
<a id='line_4229'>  Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.</a>
<a id='line_4230'>  Fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms;</a>
<a id='line_4231'>  And live the rest, secure of future harms.</a>
<a id='line_4232'>  Two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,</a>
<a id='line_4233'>  To earth a sable, to the sun a white,</a>
<a id='line_4234'>  Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring</a>
<a id='line_4235'>  Select to Jove, the inviolable king.</a>
<a id='line_4236'>  Let reverend Priam in the truce engage,</a>
<a id='line_4237'>  And add the sanction of considerate age;</a>
<a id='line_4238'>  His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,</a>
<a id='line_4239'>  And youth itself an empty wavering state;</a>
<a id='line_4240'>  Cool age advances, venerably wise,</a>
<a id='line_4241'>  Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;</a>
<a id='line_4242'>  Sees what befell, and what may yet befall,</a>
<a id='line_4243'>  Concludes from both, and best provides for all.</a>
<a id='line_4244'></a>
<a id='line_4245'>  The nations hear with rising hopes possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_4246'>  And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.</a>
<a id='line_4247'>  Within the lines they drew their steeds around,</a>
<a id='line_4248'>  And from their chariots issued on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_4249'>  Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,</a>
<a id='line_4250'>  Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.</a>
<a id='line_4251'>  On either side the meeting hosts are seen</a>
<a id='line_4252'>  With lances fix'd, and close the space between.</a>
<a id='line_4253'>  Two heralds now, despatch'd to Troy, invite</a>
<a id='line_4254'>  The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.</a>
<a id='line_4255'></a>
<a id='line_4256'>  Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring</a>
<a id='line_4257'>  The lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.</a>
<a id='line_4258'></a>
<a id='line_4259'>  Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies</a>
<a id='line_4260'>  The various goddess of the rainbow flies:</a>
<a id='line_4261'>  (Like fair Laodice in form and face,</a>
<a id='line_4262'>  The loveliest nymph of Priam's royal race:)</a>
<a id='line_4263'>  Her in the palace, at her loom she found;</a>
<a id='line_4264'>  The golden web her own sad story crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_4265'>  The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)</a>
<a id='line_4266'>  And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4267'>  To whom the goddess of the painted bow:</a>
<a id='line_4268'>  "Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!(112)</a>
<a id='line_4269'>  Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,</a>
<a id='line_4270'>  So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,</a>
<a id='line_4271'>  Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;</a>
<a id='line_4272'>  Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.</a>
<a id='line_4273'>  Paris alone and Sparta's king advance,</a>
<a id='line_4274'>  In single fight to toss the beamy lance;</a>
<a id='line_4275'>  Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,</a>
<a id='line_4276'>  Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize."</a>
<a id='line_4277'></a>
<a id='line_4278'>  This said, the many-coloured maid inspires</a>
<a id='line_4279'>  Her husband's love, and wakes her former fires;</a>
<a id='line_4280'>  Her country, parents, all that once were dear,</a>
<a id='line_4281'>  Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,</a>
<a id='line_4282'>  O'er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,</a>
<a id='line_4283'>  And, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_4284'>  Her handmaids, Clymene and AEthra, wait</a>
<a id='line_4285'>  Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.</a>
<a id='line_4286'></a>
<a id='line_4287'>  There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:</a>
<a id='line_4288'>  (Old Priam's chiefs, and most in Priam's grace,)</a>
<a id='line_4289'>  The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;</a>
<a id='line_4290'>  Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;</a>
<a id='line_4291'>  Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;</a>
<a id='line_4292'>  And next, the wisest of the reverend throng,</a>
<a id='line_4293'>  Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,</a>
<a id='line_4294'>  Lean'd on the walls and bask'd before the sun:</a>
<a id='line_4295'>  Chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,</a>
<a id='line_4296'>  But wise through time, and narrative with age,</a>
<a id='line_4297'>  In summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,</a>
<a id='line_4298'>  A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.</a>
<a id='line_4299'>  These, when the Spartan queen approach'd the tower,</a>
<a id='line_4300'>  In secret own'd resistless beauty's power:</a>
<a id='line_4301'>  They cried, "No wonder such celestial charms(113)</a>
<a id='line_4302'>  For nine long years have set the world in arms;</a>
<a id='line_4303'>  What winning graces! what majestic mien!</a>
<a id='line_4304'>  She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!</a>
<a id='line_4305'>  Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,</a>
<a id='line_4306'>  And from destruction save the Trojan race."</a>
<a id='line_4307'></a>
<a id='line_4308'>  The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,</a>
<a id='line_4309'>  "Approach, my child, and grace thy father's side.</a>
<a id='line_4310'>  See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,</a>
<a id='line_4311'>  The friends and kindred of thy former years.</a>
<a id='line_4312'>  No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,</a>
<a id='line_4313'>  Not thou, but Heaven's disposing will, the cause</a>
<a id='line_4314'>  The gods these armies and this force employ,</a>
<a id='line_4315'>  The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_4316'>  But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he</a>
<a id='line_4317'>  (Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)</a>
<a id='line_4318'>  Around whose brow such martial graces shine,</a>
<a id='line_4319'>  So tall, so awful, and almost divine!</a>
<a id='line_4320'>  Though some of larger stature tread the green,</a>
<a id='line_4321'>  None match his grandeur and exalted mien:</a>
<a id='line_4322'>  He seems a monarch, and his country's pride."</a>
<a id='line_4323'>  Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:</a>
<a id='line_4324'></a>
<a id='line_4325'>  "Before thy presence, father, I appear,</a>
<a id='line_4326'>  With conscious shame and reverential fear.</a>
<a id='line_4327'>  Ah! had I died, ere to these walk I fled,</a>
<a id='line_4328'>  False to my country, and my nuptial bed;</a>
<a id='line_4329'>  My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,</a>
<a id='line_4330'>  False to them all, to Paris only kind!</a>
<a id='line_4331'>  For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease</a>
<a id='line_4332'>  Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!</a>
<a id='line_4333'>  The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,</a>
<a id='line_4334'>  Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:</a>
<a id='line_4335'>  My brother once, before my days of shame!</a>
<a id='line_4336'>  And oh! that still he bore a brother's name!"</a>
<a id='line_4337'></a>
<a id='line_4338'>  With wonder Priam view'd the godlike man,</a>
<a id='line_4339'>  Extoll'd the happy prince, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_4340'>  "O bless'd Atrides! born to prosperous fate,</a>
<a id='line_4341'>  Successful monarch of a mighty state!</a>
<a id='line_4342'>  How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train</a>
<a id='line_4343'>  What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!</a>
<a id='line_4344'>  In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,</a>
<a id='line_4345'>  In ancient time, when Otreus fill'd the throne,</a>
<a id='line_4346'>  When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,</a>
<a id='line_4347'>  And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:</a>
<a id='line_4348'>  Against the manlike Amazons we stood,(114)</a>
<a id='line_4349'>  And Sangar's stream ran purple with their blood.</a>
<a id='line_4350'>  But far inferior those, in martial grace,</a>
<a id='line_4351'>  And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race."</a>
<a id='line_4352'></a>
<a id='line_4353'>  This said, once more he view'd the warrior train;</a>
<a id='line_4354'>  "What's he, whose arms lie scatter'd on the plain?</a>
<a id='line_4355'>  Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,</a>
<a id='line_4356'>  Though great Atrides overtops his head.</a>
<a id='line_4357'>  Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;</a>
<a id='line_4358'>  From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.</a>
<a id='line_4359'>  The stately ram thus measures o'er the ground,</a>
<a id='line_4360'>  And, master of the flock, surveys them round."</a>
<a id='line_4361'></a>
<a id='line_4362'>  Then Helen thus: "Whom your discerning eyes</a>
<a id='line_4363'>  Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;</a>
<a id='line_4364'>  A barren island boasts his glorious birth;</a>
<a id='line_4365'>  His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth."</a>
<a id='line_4366'></a>
<a id='line_4367'>  Antenor took the word, and thus began:(115)</a>
<a id='line_4368'>  "Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man</a>
<a id='line_4369'>  When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,</a>
<a id='line_4370'>  To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;</a>
<a id='line_4371'>  (Great Menelaus urged the same request;)</a>
<a id='line_4372'>  My house was honour'd with each royal guest:</a>
<a id='line_4373'>  I knew their persons, and admired their parts,</a>
<a id='line_4374'>  Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.</a>
<a id='line_4375'>  Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;</a>
<a id='line_4376'>  Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.</a>
<a id='line_4377'>  When Atreus' son harangued the listening train,</a>
<a id='line_4378'>  Just was his sense, and his expression plain,</a>
<a id='line_4379'>  His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;</a>
<a id='line_4380'>  He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.</a>
<a id='line_4381'>  But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,(116)</a>
<a id='line_4382'>  His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground;</a>
<a id='line_4383'>  As one unskill'd or dumb, he seem'd to stand,</a>
<a id='line_4384'>  Nor raised his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand;</a>
<a id='line_4385'>  But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!</a>
<a id='line_4386'>  Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,(117)</a>
<a id='line_4387'>  The copious accents fall, with easy art;</a>
<a id='line_4388'>  Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!</a>
<a id='line_4389'>  Wondering we hear, and fix'd in deep surprise,</a>
<a id='line_4390'>  Our ears refute the censure of our eyes."</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>  The king then ask'd (as yet the camp he view'd)</a>
<a id='line_4393'>  "What chief is that, with giant strength endued,</a>
<a id='line_4394'>  Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,</a>
<a id='line_4395'>  And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?</a>
<a id='line_4396'>  "Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)</a>
<a id='line_4397'>  Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.</a>
<a id='line_4398'>  See! bold Idomeneus superior towers</a>
<a id='line_4399'>  Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,</a>
<a id='line_4400'>  Great as a god! I saw him once before,</a>
<a id='line_4401'>  With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.</a>
<a id='line_4402'>  The rest I know, and could in order name;</a>
<a id='line_4403'>  All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.</a>
<a id='line_4404'>  Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,</a>
<a id='line_4405'>  Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:</a>
<a id='line_4406'>  Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,</a>
<a id='line_4407'>  One bold on foot, and one renown'd for horse.</a>
<a id='line_4408'>  My brothers these; the same our native shore,</a>
<a id='line_4409'>  One house contain'd us, as one mother bore.</a>
<a id='line_4410'>  Perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,</a>
<a id='line_4411'>  For distant Troy refused to sail the seas;</a>
<a id='line_4412'>  Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,</a>
<a id='line_4413'>  Ashamed to combat in their sister's cause."</a>
<a id='line_4414'></a>
<a id='line_4415'>  So spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers' doom;(118)</a>
<a id='line_4416'>  Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;</a>
<a id='line_4417'>  Adorn'd with honours in their native shore,</a>
<a id='line_4418'>  Silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.</a>
<a id='line_4419'></a>
<a id='line_4420'>  Meantime the heralds, through the crowded town.</a>
<a id='line_4421'>  Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.</a>
<a id='line_4422'>  Idaeus' arms the golden goblets press'd,(119)</a>
<a id='line_4423'>  Who thus the venerable king address'd:</a>
<a id='line_4424'>  "Arise, O father of the Trojan state!</a>
<a id='line_4425'>  The nations call, thy joyful people wait</a>
<a id='line_4426'>  To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.</a>
<a id='line_4427'>  Paris, thy son, and Sparta's king advance,</a>
<a id='line_4428'>  In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;</a>
<a id='line_4429'>  And who his rival shall in arms subdue,</a>
<a id='line_4430'>  His be the dame, and his the treasure too.</a>
<a id='line_4431'>  Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,</a>
<a id='line_4432'>  And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:</a>
<a id='line_4433'>  So shall the Greeks review their native shore,</a>
<a id='line_4434'>  Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."</a>
<a id='line_4435'></a>
<a id='line_4436'>  With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare</a>
<a id='line_4437'>  To join his milk-white coursers to the car;</a>
<a id='line_4438'>  He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;</a>
<a id='line_4439'>  The gentle steeds through Scaea's gates they guide:(120)</a>
<a id='line_4440'>  Next from the car descending on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_4441'>  Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,</a>
<a id='line_4442'>  Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then</a>
<a id='line_4443'>  Arose, and with him rose the king of men.</a>
<a id='line_4444'>  On either side a sacred herald stands,</a>
<a id='line_4445'>  The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands</a>
<a id='line_4446'>  Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord</a>
<a id='line_4447'>  His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;</a>
<a id='line_4448'>  From the sign'd victims crops the curling hair;(121)</a>
<a id='line_4449'>  The heralds part it, and the princes share;</a>
<a id='line_4450'>  Then loudly thus before the attentive bands</a>
<a id='line_4451'>  He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>  "O first and greatest power! whom all obey,</a>
<a id='line_4454'>  Who high on Ida's holy mountain sway,</a>
<a id='line_4455'>  Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll</a>
<a id='line_4456'>  From east to west, and view from pole to pole!</a>
<a id='line_4457'>  Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!</a>
<a id='line_4458'>  Infernal furies, and Tartarean gods,</a>
<a id='line_4459'>  Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare</a>
<a id='line_4460'>  For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!</a>
<a id='line_4461'>  Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,</a>
<a id='line_4462'>  Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;</a>
<a id='line_4463'>  The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,</a>
<a id='line_4464'>  And Greece returning plough the watery deep.</a>
<a id='line_4465'>  If by my brother's lance the Trojan bleed,</a>
<a id='line_4466'>  Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:</a>
<a id='line_4467'>  The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,</a>
<a id='line_4468'>  And every age record the signal day.</a>
<a id='line_4469'>  This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,</a>
<a id='line_4470'>  Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field."</a>
<a id='line_4471'></a>
<a id='line_4472'>  With that the chief the tender victims slew,</a>
<a id='line_4473'>  And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;</a>
<a id='line_4474'>  The vital spirit issued at the wound,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>  And left the members quivering on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4476'>  From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,</a>
<a id='line_4477'>  And add libations to the powers divine.</a>
<a id='line_4478'>  While thus their prayers united mount the sky,</a>
<a id='line_4479'>  "Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!</a>
<a id='line_4480'>  And may their blood, who first the league confound,</a>
<a id='line_4481'>  Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;</a>
<a id='line_4482'>  May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,</a>
<a id='line_4483'>  And all their lust be scatter'd as the dust!"</a>
<a id='line_4484'>  Thus either host their imprecations join'd,</a>
<a id='line_4485'>  Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.</a>
<a id='line_4486'></a>
<a id='line_4487'>  The rites now finish'd, reverend Priam rose,</a>
<a id='line_4488'>  And thus express'd a heart o'ercharged with woes:</a>
<a id='line_4489'>  "Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,</a>
<a id='line_4490'>  But spare the weakness of my feeble age:</a>
<a id='line_4491'>  In yonder walls that object let me shun,</a>
<a id='line_4492'>  Nor view the danger of so dear a son.</a>
<a id='line_4493'>  Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,</a>
<a id='line_4494'>  Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all."</a>
<a id='line_4495'></a>
<a id='line_4496'>  This said, the hoary king no longer stay'd,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>  But on his car the slaughter'd victims laid:</a>
<a id='line_4498'>  Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,</a>
<a id='line_4499'>  And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.</a>
<a id='line_4500'></a>
<a id='line_4501'>  Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose</a>
<a id='line_4502'>  The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:</a>
<a id='line_4503'>  Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,</a>
<a id='line_4504'>  Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.</a>
<a id='line_4505'>  The people pray with elevated hands,</a>
<a id='line_4506'>  And words like these are heard through all the bands:</a>
<a id='line_4507'>  "Immortal Jove, high Heaven's superior lord,</a>
<a id='line_4508'>  On lofty Ida's holy mount adored!</a>
<a id='line_4509'>  Whoe'er involved us in this dire debate,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>  O give that author of the war to fate</a>
<a id='line_4511'>  And shades eternal! let division cease,</a>
<a id='line_4512'>  And joyful nations join in leagues of peace."</a>
<a id='line_4513'></a>
<a id='line_4514'>  With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn</a>
<a id='line_4515'>  The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.</a>
<a id='line_4516'>  Then, Paris, thine leap'd forth; by fatal chance</a>
<a id='line_4517'>  Ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty lance.</a>
<a id='line_4518'>  Both armies sat the combat to survey.</a>
<a id='line_4519'>  Beside each chief his azure armour lay,</a>
<a id='line_4520'>  And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.</a>
<a id='line_4521'>  The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>  In gilded arms magnificently bright:</a>
<a id='line_4523'>  The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,</a>
<a id='line_4524'>  With flowers adorn'd, with silver buckles bound:</a>
<a id='line_4525'>  Lycaon's corslet his fair body dress'd,</a>
<a id='line_4526'>  Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;</a>
<a id='line_4527'>  A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,</a>
<a id='line_4528'>  Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:</a>
<a id='line_4529'>  His youthful face a polish'd helm o'erspread;</a>
<a id='line_4530'>  The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:</a>
<a id='line_4531'>  His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,</a>
<a id='line_4532'>  And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.</a>
<a id='line_4533'>  With equal speed and fired by equal charms,</a>
<a id='line_4534'>  The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.</a>
<a id='line_4535'></a>
<a id='line_4536'>  Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,</a>
<a id='line_4537'>  With javelins fix'd, the Greek and Trojan band.</a>
<a id='line_4538'>  Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,</a>
<a id='line_4539'>  All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.</a>
<a id='line_4540'>  The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;</a>
<a id='line_4541'>  Full on Atrides' ringing shield it flew,</a>
<a id='line_4542'>  Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound(122)</a>
<a id='line_4543'>  Leap'd from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4544'>  Atrides then his massy lance prepares,</a>
<a id='line_4545'>  In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:</a>
<a id='line_4546'></a>
<a id='line_4547'>  "Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,</a>
<a id='line_4548'>  And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:</a>
<a id='line_4549'>  Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,</a>
<a id='line_4550'>  Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!</a>
<a id='line_4551'>  Let this example future times reclaim,</a>
<a id='line_4552'>  And guard from wrong fair friendship's holy name."</a>
<a id='line_4553'>  Be said, and poised in air the javelin sent,</a>
<a id='line_4554'>  Through Paris' shield the forceful weapon went,</a>
<a id='line_4555'>  His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,</a>
<a id='line_4556'>  And glancing downward, near his flank descends.</a>
<a id='line_4557'>  The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,</a>
<a id='line_4558'>  Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:</a>
<a id='line_4559'>  But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook</a>
<a id='line_4560'>  Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;</a>
<a id='line_4561'>  The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,</a>
<a id='line_4562'>  Broke short: the fragments glitter'd on the sand.</a>
<a id='line_4563'>  The raging warrior to the spacious skies</a>
<a id='line_4564'>  Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:</a>
<a id='line_4565'>  "Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?</a>
<a id='line_4566'>  And is it thus the gods assist the just?</a>
<a id='line_4567'>  When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;</a>
<a id='line_4568'>  The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies."</a>
<a id='line_4569'>  Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew</a>
<a id='line_4570'>  (Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;</a>
<a id='line_4571'>  Struggling he followed, while the embroider'd thong</a>
<a id='line_4572'>  That tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along.</a>
<a id='line_4573'>  Then had his ruin crown'd Atrides' joy,</a>
<a id='line_4574'>  But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:</a>
<a id='line_4575'>  Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;</a>
<a id='line_4576'>  And left an empty helmet in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_4577'>  The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;</a>
<a id='line_4578'>  The Greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view.</a>
<a id='line_4579'>  Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,</a>
<a id='line_4580'>  In thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart;</a>
<a id='line_4581'>  The queen of love her favour'd champion shrouds</a>
<a id='line_4582'>  (For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds.</a>
<a id='line_4583'>  Raised from the field the panting youth she led,</a>
<a id='line_4584'>  And gently laid him on the bridal bed,</a>
<a id='line_4585'>  With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,</a>
<a id='line_4586'>  And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.</a>
<a id='line_4587'>  Meantime the brightest of the female kind,</a>
<a id='line_4588'>  The matchless Helen, o'er the walls reclined;</a>
<a id='line_4589'>  To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came,</a>
<a id='line_4590'>  In borrow'd form, the laughter-loving dame.</a>
<a id='line_4591'>  (She seem'd an ancient maid, well-skill'd to cull</a>
<a id='line_4592'>  The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.)</a>
<a id='line_4593'>  The goddess softly shook her silken vest,</a>
<a id='line_4594'>  That shed perfumes, and whispering thus address'd:</a>

<a id='line_4607'></a>
<a id='line_4608'>  She spoke, and Helen's secret soul was moved;</a>

<a id='line_4612'>  Struck with her presence, straight the lively red</a>
<a id='line_4613'>  Forsook her cheek; and trembling, thus she said:</a>
<a id='line_4614'>  "Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive?</a>
<a id='line_4615'>  And woman's frailty always to believe!</a>
<a id='line_4616'>  Say, to new nations must I cross the main,</a>
<a id='line_4617'>  Or carry wars to some soft Asian plain?</a>

<a id='line_4624'>  A handmaid goddess at his side to wait,</a>

<a id='line_4628'>  For me, to lawless love no longer led,</a>
<a id='line_4629'>  I scorn the coward, and detest his bed;</a>
<a id='line_4630'>  Else should I merit everlasting shame,</a>

<a id='line_4672'></a>

<a id='line_4685'>  Thus having spoke, the enamour'd Phrygian boy</a>
<a id='line_4686'>  Rush'd to the bed, impatient for the joy.</a>

<a id='line_4726'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_4727'></a>
<a id='line_4728'>THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.</a>
<a id='line_4729'></a>
<a id='line_4730'>The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree upon</a>
<a id='line_4731'>the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce.</a>
<a id='line_4732'>She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is wounded, but</a>
<a id='line_4733'>cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan troops attack the</a>
<a id='line_4734'>Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general; he</a>
<a id='line_4735'>reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some by praises and others by</a>
<a id='line_4736'>reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline.</a>
<a id='line_4737'>The battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides.</a>
<a id='line_4738'></a>
<a id='line_4739'>The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it does</a>
<a id='line_4740'>also through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh</a>
<a id='line_4741'>book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.</a>
<a id='line_4742'></a>
<a id='line_4743'>  And now Olympus' shining gates unfold;</a>
<a id='line_4744'>  The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:</a>
<a id='line_4745'>  Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,</a>
<a id='line_4746'>  The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:</a>
<a id='line_4747'>  While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ</a>
<a id='line_4748'>  Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.</a>
<a id='line_4749'></a>
<a id='line_4750'>  When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia's spleen,</a>
<a id='line_4751'>  Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,</a>
<a id='line_4752'>  "Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,</a>
<a id='line_4753'>  Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;(125)</a>
<a id='line_4754'>  But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,</a>
<a id='line_4755'>  The tame spectators of his deeds of war.</a>
<a id='line_4756'>  Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight,</a>
<a id='line_4757'>  The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,</a>
<a id='line_4758'>  Each danger wards, and constant in her care,</a>
<a id='line_4759'>  Saves in the moment of the last despair.</a>
<a id='line_4760'>  Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life,</a>
<a id='line_4761'>  Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife.</a>
<a id='line_4762'>  Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits</a>
<a id='line_4763'>  To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!</a>
<a id='line_4764'>  Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,</a>
<a id='line_4765'>  Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?</a>
<a id='line_4766'>  Yet, would the gods for human good provide,</a>
<a id='line_4767'>  Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,</a>
<a id='line_4768'>  Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,</a>

<a id='line_4771'>  Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,</a>
<a id='line_4772'>  And queen of war, in close consult engaged:</a>
<a id='line_4773'>  Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,</a>
<a id='line_4774'>  And meditate the future woes of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_4775'>  Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,</a>
<a id='line_4776'>  The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_4777'>  But Juno, impotent of passion, broke</a>
<a id='line_4778'>  Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:</a>

<a id='line_4785'>  "Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!</a>

<a id='line_4824'></a>
<a id='line_4825'>  At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,</a>

<a id='line_4849'>  The sire of men and monarch of the sky</a>
<a id='line_4850'>  The advice approved, and bade Minerva fly,</a>

<a id='line_4852'>  To make the breach the faithless act of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_4853'>  Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,</a>
<a id='line_4854'>  And shot like lightning from Olympus' height.</a>
<a id='line_4855'>  As the red comet, from Saturnius sent</a>
<a id='line_4856'>  To fright the nations with a dire portent,</a>
<a id='line_4857'>  (A fatal sign to armies on the plain,</a>

<a id='line_4859'>  With sweeping glories glides along in air,</a>

<a id='line_4868'>  Jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars."</a>
<a id='line_4869'></a>
<a id='line_4870'>  They said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng,</a>
<a id='line_4871'>  (In shape a mortal,) pass'd disguised along.</a>
<a id='line_4872'>  Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent,</a>
<a id='line_4873'>  Who from Antenor traced his high descent.</a>
<a id='line_4874'>  Amidst the ranks Lycaon's son she found,</a>
<a id='line_4875'>  The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown'd;</a>
<a id='line_4876'>  Whose squadrons, led from black AEsepus' flood,(130)</a>
<a id='line_4877'>  With flaming shields in martial circle stood.</a>
<a id='line_4878'>  To him the goddess: "Phrygian! canst thou hear</a>
<a id='line_4879'>  A well-timed counsel with a willing ear?</a>
<a id='line_4880'>  What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,</a>
<a id='line_4881'>  Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan's heart?</a>
<a id='line_4882'>  What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,</a>
<a id='line_4883'>  Thy country's foe, the Grecian glory slain?</a>
<a id='line_4884'>  Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,</a>
<a id='line_4885'>  Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!</a>
<a id='line_4886'>  But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow</a>
<a id='line_4887'>  To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow,</a>
<a id='line_4888'>  And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,</a>
<a id='line_4889'>  On Zelia's altars, to the god of day."(131)</a>
<a id='line_4890'></a>
<a id='line_4891'>  He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,</a>
<a id='line_4892'>  His polish'd bow with hasty rashness seized.</a>
<a id='line_4893'>  'Twas form'd of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil:</a>
<a id='line_4894'>  A mountain goat resign'd the shining spoil.</a>
<a id='line_4895'>  Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;</a>
<a id='line_4896'>  The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,</a>
<a id='line_4897'>  And sixteen palms his brow's large honours spread:</a>
<a id='line_4898'>  The workmen join'd, and shaped the bended horns,</a>
<a id='line_4899'>  And beaten gold each taper point adorns.</a>
<a id='line_4900'>  This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,</a>
<a id='line_4901'>  Screen'd by the shields of his surrounding friends:</a>
<a id='line_4902'>  There meditates the mark; and couching low,</a>
<a id='line_4903'>  Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.</a>
<a id='line_4904'>  One from a hundred feather'd deaths he chose,</a>
<a id='line_4905'>  Fated to wound, and cause of future woes;</a>
<a id='line_4906'>  Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown</a>
<a id='line_4907'>  Apollo's altars in his native town.</a>
<a id='line_4908'></a>
<a id='line_4909'>  Now with full force the yielding horn he bends,</a>
<a id='line_4910'>  Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;</a>
<a id='line_4911'>  Close to his breast he strains the nerve below,</a>
<a id='line_4912'>  Till the barb'd points approach the circling bow;</a>
<a id='line_4913'>  The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;</a>
<a id='line_4914'>  Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.</a>
<a id='line_4915'></a>
<a id='line_4916'>  But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour</a>
<a id='line_4917'>  The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,</a>
<a id='line_4918'>  Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force)</a>
<a id='line_4919'>  Diverts the weapon from its destined course:</a>
<a id='line_4920'>  So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,</a>
<a id='line_4921'>  The watchful mother wafts the envenom'd fly.</a>
<a id='line_4922'>  Just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>  Where linen folds the double corslet lined,</a>
<a id='line_4924'>  She turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,</a>
<a id='line_4925'>  Pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;</a>
<a id='line_4926'>  The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,</a>
<a id='line_4927'>  And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.</a>
<a id='line_4928'>  As when some stately trappings are decreed</a>
<a id='line_4929'>  To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,</a>
<a id='line_4930'>  A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,</a>
<a id='line_4931'>  Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;</a>
<a id='line_4932'>  With equal lustre various colours vie,</a>
<a id='line_4933'>  The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:</a>
<a id='line_4934'>  So great Atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,</a>
<a id='line_4935'>  As down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.</a>
<a id='line_4936'>  With horror seized, the king of men descried</a>
<a id='line_4937'>  The shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide:</a>
<a id='line_4938'>  Nor less the Spartan fear'd, before he found</a>
<a id='line_4939'>  The shining barb appear above the wound,</a>
<a id='line_4940'>  Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,</a>
<a id='line_4941'>  The royal brother thus his grief express'd,</a>
<a id='line_4942'>  And grasp'd his hand; while all the Greeks around</a>
<a id='line_4943'>  With answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.</a>
<a id='line_4944'></a>
<a id='line_4945'>  "Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree</a>
<a id='line_4946'>  The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!</a>
<a id='line_4947'>  Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,</a>
<a id='line_4948'>  To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!</a>
<a id='line_4949'>  The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,</a>
<a id='line_4950'>  And faith is scorn'd by all the perjured line.</a>
<a id='line_4951'>  Not thus our vows, confirm'd with wine and gore,</a>
<a id='line_4952'>  Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,</a>
<a id='line_4953'>  Shall all be vain: when Heaven's revenge is slow,</a>
<a id='line_4954'>  Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.</a>
<a id='line_4955'>  The day shall come, that great avenging day,</a>
<a id='line_4956'>  When Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay,</a>
<a id='line_4957'>  When Priam's powers and Priam's self shall fall,</a>
<a id='line_4958'>  And one prodigious ruin swallow all.</a>
<a id='line_4959'>  I see the god, already, from the pole</a>
<a id='line_4960'>  Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;</a>
<a id='line_4961'>  I see the Eternal all his fury shed,</a>
<a id='line_4962'>  And shake his aegis o'er their guilty head.</a>
<a id='line_4963'>  Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;</a>
<a id='line_4964'>  But thou, alas! deserv'st a happier fate.</a>
<a id='line_4965'>  Still must I mourn the period of thy days,</a>
<a id='line_4966'>  And only mourn, without my share of praise?</a>
<a id='line_4967'>  Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more</a>
<a id='line_4968'>  Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;</a>
<a id='line_4969'>  Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,</a>
<a id='line_4970'>  Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;</a>
<a id='line_4971'>  While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,</a>
<a id='line_4972'>  (And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)</a>
<a id='line_4973'>  'Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,</a>
<a id='line_4974'>  And such the conquest of her king of kings!</a>
<a id='line_4975'>  Lo his proud vessels scatter'd o'er the main,</a>
<a id='line_4976'>  And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.'</a>
<a id='line_4977'>  Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,</a>
<a id='line_4978'>  O'erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch's shame."</a>
<a id='line_4979'></a>
<a id='line_4980'>  He said: a leader's and a brother's fears</a>
<a id='line_4981'>  Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:</a>
<a id='line_4982'>  "Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;</a>
<a id='line_4983'>  The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:</a>
<a id='line_4984'>  Stiff with the rich embroider'd work around,</a>
<a id='line_4985'>  My varied belt repell'd the flying wound."</a>
<a id='line_4986'></a>
<a id='line_4987'>  To whom the king: "My brother and my friend,</a>
<a id='line_4988'>  Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!</a>
<a id='line_4989'>  Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art</a>
<a id='line_4990'>  May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.</a>
<a id='line_4991'>  Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring</a>
<a id='line_4992'>  His speedy succour to the Spartan king;</a>
<a id='line_4993'>  Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),</a>
<a id='line_4994'>  The Grecian's sorrow, and the Dardan's joy."</a>
<a id='line_4995'></a>
<a id='line_4996'>  With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;</a>
<a id='line_4997'>  Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,</a>
<a id='line_4998'>  And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands(132)</a>
<a id='line_4999'>  In arms incircled with his native bands.</a>
<a id='line_5000'>  Then thus: "Machaon, to the king repair,</a>
<a id='line_5001'>  His wounded brother claims thy timely care;</a>
<a id='line_5002'>  Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,</a>
<a id='line_5003'>  A grief to us, a triumph to the foe."</a>
<a id='line_5004'></a>
<a id='line_5005'>  The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man</a>
<a id='line_5006'>  Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.</a>
<a id='line_5007'>  The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,</a>
<a id='line_5008'>  And all the chiefs in deep concern around.</a>
<a id='line_5009'>  Where to the steely point the reed was join'd,</a>
<a id='line_5010'>  The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.</a>
<a id='line_5011'>  Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,</a>
<a id='line_5012'>  He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;</a>
<a id='line_5013'>  Then suck'd the blood, and sovereign balm infused,(133)</a>
<a id='line_5014'>  Which Chiron gave, and AEsculapius used.</a>
<a id='line_5015'></a>
<a id='line_5016'>  While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,</a>
<a id='line_5017'>  The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;</a>
<a id='line_5018'>  Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,</a>
<a id='line_5019'>  Once more the fields are fill'd with dire alarms.</a>
<a id='line_5020'>  Nor had you seen the king of men appear</a>
<a id='line_5021'>  Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;</a>
<a id='line_5022'>  But fond of glory, with severe delight,</a>
<a id='line_5023'>  His beating bosom claim'd the rising fight.</a>
<a id='line_5024'>  No longer with his warlike steeds he stay'd,</a>
<a id='line_5025'>  Or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid</a>
<a id='line_5026'>  But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;</a>
<a id='line_5027'>  The fiery coursers snorted at his side.</a>
<a id='line_5028'>  On foot through all the martial ranks he moves</a>
<a id='line_5029'>  And these encourages, and those reproves.</a>
<a id='line_5030'>  "Brave men!" he cries, (to such who boldly dare</a>
<a id='line_5031'>  Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),</a>
<a id='line_5032'>  "Your ancient valour on the foes approve;</a>
<a id='line_5033'>  Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.</a>
<a id='line_5034'>  'Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,</a>
<a id='line_5035'>  Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;</a>
<a id='line_5036'>  Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,</a>
<a id='line_5037'>  And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains."</a>
<a id='line_5038'></a>
<a id='line_5039'>  Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;</a>
<a id='line_5040'>  Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:</a>
<a id='line_5041'>  "Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;</a>
<a id='line_5042'>  Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!</a>
<a id='line_5043'>  Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,</a>
<a id='line_5044'>  Prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?</a>
<a id='line_5045'>  Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer</a>
<a id='line_5046'>  Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.</a>
<a id='line_5047'>  Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,</a>
<a id='line_5048'>  Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?</a>
<a id='line_5049'>  Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,</a>
<a id='line_5050'>  To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?"</a>
<a id='line_5051'></a>
<a id='line_5052'>  This said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,</a>
<a id='line_5053'>  To Crete's brave monarch and his martial throng;</a>
<a id='line_5054'>  High at their head he saw the chief appear,</a>
<a id='line_5055'>  And bold Meriones excite the rear.</a>
<a id='line_5056'>  At this the king his generous joy express'd,</a>
<a id='line_5057'>  And clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.</a>
<a id='line_5058'>  "Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe</a>
<a id='line_5059'>  To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?</a>
<a id='line_5060'>  To thee the foremost honours are decreed,</a>
<a id='line_5061'>  First in the fight and every graceful deed.</a>
<a id='line_5062'>  For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls</a>
<a id='line_5063'>  Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,</a>
<a id='line_5064'>  Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,</a>
<a id='line_5065'>  Unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_5066'>  Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;</a>
<a id='line_5067'>  Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame."</a>
<a id='line_5068'>  To whom the Cretan thus his speech address'd:</a>
<a id='line_5069'>  "Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.</a>
<a id='line_5070'>  Fix'd to thy side, in every toil I share,</a>
<a id='line_5071'>  Thy firm associate in the day of war.</a>
<a id='line_5072'>  But let the signal be this moment given;</a>
<a id='line_5073'>  To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5074'>  The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,</a>
<a id='line_5075'>  And chains or death avenge the impious deed."</a>
<a id='line_5076'></a>
<a id='line_5077'>  Charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,</a>
<a id='line_5078'>  And next the troops of either Ajax views:</a>
<a id='line_5079'>  In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,</a>
<a id='line_5080'>  A cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5081'>  Thus from the lofty promontory's brow</a>
<a id='line_5082'>  A swain surveys the gathering storm below;</a>
<a id='line_5083'>  Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,</a>
<a id='line_5084'>  Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,</a>
<a id='line_5085'>  Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,</a>
<a id='line_5086'>  The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:</a>
<a id='line_5087'>  He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock</a>
<a id='line_5088'>  To the close covert of an arching rock.</a>
<a id='line_5089'></a>
<a id='line_5090'>  Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,</a>
<a id='line_5091'>  With spears erect, a moving iron wood:</a>
<a id='line_5092'>  A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,</a>
<a id='line_5093'>  And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.</a>
<a id='line_5094'></a>
<a id='line_5095'>  "O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,</a>
<a id='line_5096'>  Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,</a>
<a id='line_5097'>  (Exclaim'd the king), who raise your eager bands</a>
<a id='line_5098'>  With great examples, more than loud commands.</a>
<a id='line_5099'>  Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest</a>
<a id='line_5100'>  Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,</a>
<a id='line_5101'>  Soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_5102'>  And Troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground."</a>
<a id='line_5103'></a>
<a id='line_5104'>  Then to the next the general bends his course;</a>
<a id='line_5105'>  (His heart exults, and glories in his force);</a>
<a id='line_5106'>  There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,</a>
<a id='line_5107'>  And with inspiring eloquence commands;</a>
<a id='line_5108'>  With strictest order sets his train in arms,</a>
<a id='line_5109'>  The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.</a>
<a id='line_5110'>  Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,</a>
<a id='line_5111'>  Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.</a>
<a id='line_5112'>  The horse and chariots to the front assign'd,</a>
<a id='line_5113'>  The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;</a>
<a id='line_5114'>  The middle space suspected troops supply,</a>
<a id='line_5115'>  Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;</a>
<a id='line_5116'>  He gives command to "curb the fiery steed,</a>
<a id='line_5117'>  Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:</a>
<a id='line_5118'>  Before the rest let none too rashly ride;</a>
<a id='line_5119'>  No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:</a>
<a id='line_5120'>  The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,</a>
<a id='line_5121'>  But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.</a>
<a id='line_5122'>  He whom the fortune of the field shall cast</a>
<a id='line_5123'>  From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;</a>
<a id='line_5124'>  Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,</a>
<a id='line_5125'>  Content with javelins to provoke the war.</a>
<a id='line_5126'>  Our great forefathers held this prudent course,</a>
<a id='line_5127'>  Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;</a>
<a id='line_5128'>  By laws like these immortal conquests made,</a>
<a id='line_5129'>  And earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid."</a>
<a id='line_5130'></a>
<a id='line_5131'>  So spoke the master of the martial art,</a>
<a id='line_5132'>  And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.</a>
<a id='line_5133'>  "Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,</a>
<a id='line_5134'>  And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!</a>
<a id='line_5135'>  But wasting years, that wither human race,</a>
<a id='line_5136'>  Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.</a>
<a id='line_5137'>  What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!</a>
<a id='line_5138'>  And age the lot of any chief but thee."</a>
<a id='line_5139'></a>
<a id='line_5140'>  Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;</a>
<a id='line_5141'>  He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_5142'>  "Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew(134)</a>
<a id='line_5143'>  That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;</a>
<a id='line_5144'>  Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain</a>
<a id='line_5145'>  Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5146'>  But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,</a>
<a id='line_5147'>  These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:</a>
<a id='line_5148'>  The field of combat fits the young and bold,</a>
<a id='line_5149'>  The solemn council best becomes the old:</a>
<a id='line_5150'>  To you the glorious conflict I resign,</a>
<a id='line_5151'>  Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine."</a>
<a id='line_5152'></a>
<a id='line_5153'>  He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,</a>
<a id='line_5154'>  And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,</a>
<a id='line_5155'>  With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;</a>
<a id='line_5156'>  And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.</a>
<a id='line_5157'>  Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far</a>
<a id='line_5158'>  The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;</a>
<a id='line_5159'>  The tumult late begun, they stood intent</a>
<a id='line_5160'>  To watch the motion, dubious of the event.</a>
<a id='line_5161'>  The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,</a>
<a id='line_5162'>  With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:</a>
<a id='line_5163'></a>
<a id='line_5164'>  "Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.</a>
<a id='line_5165'>  And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?</a>
<a id='line_5166'>  Why stand you distant, and the rest expect</a>
<a id='line_5167'>  To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?</a>
<a id='line_5168'>  From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare</a>
<a id='line_5169'>  The shock of armies, and commence the war;</a>
<a id='line_5170'>  For this your names are call'd before the rest,</a>
<a id='line_5171'>  To share the pleasures of the genial feast:</a>
<a id='line_5172'>  And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey</a>
<a id='line_5173'>  Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?</a>
<a id='line_5174'>  Say, is it thus those honours you requite?</a>
<a id='line_5175'>  The first in banquets, but the last in fight."</a>
<a id='line_5176'></a>
<a id='line_5177'>  Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread</a>
<a id='line_5178'>  His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:</a>
<a id='line_5179'>  "Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand</a>
<a id='line_5180'>  Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.</a>
<a id='line_5181'>  If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,</a>
<a id='line_5182'>  Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.</a>
<a id='line_5183'>  Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,</a>
<a id='line_5184'>  Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view."</a>
<a id='line_5185'>  Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:</a>
<a id='line_5186'></a>
<a id='line_5187'>  "O great in action, and in council wise!</a>
<a id='line_5188'>  With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,</a>
<a id='line_5189'>  Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.</a>
<a id='line_5190'>  Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,</a>
<a id='line_5191'>  Forgive the transport of a martial mind.</a>
<a id='line_5192'>  Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;</a>
<a id='line_5193'>  The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends."</a>
<a id='line_5194'></a>
<a id='line_5195'>  He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,</a>
<a id='line_5196'>  His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;</a>
<a id='line_5197'>  (The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)(135)</a>
<a id='line_5198'>  To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:</a>
<a id='line_5199'>  "O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame</a>
<a id='line_5200'>  The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)</a>
<a id='line_5201'>  Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,</a>
<a id='line_5202'>  With hands unactive, and a careless eye?</a>
<a id='line_5203'>  Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;</a>
<a id='line_5204'>  Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:</a>
<a id='line_5205'>  What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>  Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?</a>
<a id='line_5207'>  I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,</a>
<a id='line_5208'>  A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae's towers;</a>
<a id='line_5209'>  Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,</a>
<a id='line_5210'>  Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;</a>
<a id='line_5211'>  While dreadful comets glaring from afar,</a>
<a id='line_5212'>  Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.(136)</a>
<a id='line_5213'>  Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,</a>
<a id='line_5214'>  A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;</a>
<a id='line_5215'>  Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,</a>
<a id='line_5216'>  Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.</a>
<a id='line_5217'>  The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,</a>
<a id='line_5218'>  And dared to combat all those chiefs around:</a>
<a id='line_5219'>  Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;</a>
<a id='line_5220'>  For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.</a>
<a id='line_5221'>  Stung with the shame, within the winding way,</a>
<a id='line_5222'>  To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;</a>
<a id='line_5223'>  Two heroes led the secret squadron on,</a>
<a id='line_5224'>  Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;</a>
<a id='line_5225'>  Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.</a>
<a id='line_5226'>  He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,</a>
<a id='line_5227'>  Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;</a>
<a id='line_5228'>  Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!"</a>
<a id='line_5229'></a>
<a id='line_5230'>  No words the godlike Diomed return'd,</a>
<a id='line_5231'>  But heard respectful, and in secret burn'd:</a>
<a id='line_5232'>  Not so fierce Capaneus' undaunted son;</a>
<a id='line_5233'>  Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:</a>
<a id='line_5234'></a>
<a id='line_5235'>  "What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,</a>
<a id='line_5236'>  Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?</a>
<a id='line_5237'>  Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess</a>
<a id='line_5238'>  Our value equal, though our fury less.</a>
<a id='line_5239'>  With fewer troops we storm'd the Theban wall,</a>
<a id='line_5240'>  And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,(137)</a>
<a id='line_5241'>  In impious acts the guilty father died;</a>
<a id='line_5242'>  The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side.</a>
<a id='line_5243'>  Far more than heirs of all our parents' fame,</a>
<a id='line_5244'>  Our glories darken their diminish'd name."</a>
<a id='line_5245'></a>
<a id='line_5246'>  To him Tydides thus: "My friend, forbear;</a>
<a id='line_5247'>  Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:</a>
<a id='line_5248'>  His high concern may well excuse this rage,</a>
<a id='line_5249'>  Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:</a>
<a id='line_5250'>  His the first praise, were Ilion's towers o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_5251'>  And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.</a>
<a id='line_5252'>  Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,</a>
<a id='line_5253'>  'Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight."</a>
<a id='line_5254'></a>
<a id='line_5255'>  He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground</a>
<a id='line_5256'>  Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.</a>
<a id='line_5257'>  Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,</a>
<a id='line_5258'>  Of arm'd Tydides rushing to the war.</a>
<a id='line_5259'>  As when the winds, ascending by degrees,(138)</a>
<a id='line_5260'>  First move the whitening surface of the seas,</a>
<a id='line_5261'>  The billows float in order to the shore,</a>
<a id='line_5262'>  The wave behind rolls on the wave before;</a>
<a id='line_5263'>  Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,</a>
<a id='line_5264'>  Foam o'er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_5265'>  So to the fight the thick battalions throng,</a>
<a id='line_5266'>  Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along</a>
<a id='line_5267'>  Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;</a>
<a id='line_5268'>  No sound, no whisper, but the chief's commands,</a>
<a id='line_5269'>  Those only heard; with awe the rest obey,</a>
<a id='line_5270'>  As if some god had snatch'd their voice away.</a>
<a id='line_5271'>  Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends</a>
<a id='line_5272'>  A general shout that all the region rends.</a>
<a id='line_5273'>  As when the fleecy flocks unnumber'd stand</a>
<a id='line_5274'>  In wealthy folds, and wait the milker's hand,</a>
<a id='line_5275'>  The hollow vales incessant bleating fills,</a>
<a id='line_5276'>  The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:</a>
<a id='line_5277'>  Such clamours rose from various nations round,</a>
<a id='line_5278'>  Mix'd was the murmur, and confused the sound.</a>
<a id='line_5279'>  Each host now joins, and each a god inspires,</a>
<a id='line_5280'>  These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires,</a>
<a id='line_5281'>  Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;</a>
<a id='line_5282'>  And discord raging bathes the purple plain;</a>
<a id='line_5283'>  Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,</a>
<a id='line_5284'>  Small at her birth, but rising every hour,</a>
<a id='line_5285'>  While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,</a>
<a id='line_5286'>  She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;(139)</a>
<a id='line_5287'>  The nations bleed, where'er her steps she turns,</a>
<a id='line_5288'>  The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.</a>
<a id='line_5289'></a>
<a id='line_5290'>  Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,</a>
<a id='line_5291'>  To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,</a>
<a id='line_5292'>  Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,</a>
<a id='line_5293'>  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,</a>
<a id='line_5294'>  Victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries,</a>
<a id='line_5295'>  And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;</a>
<a id='line_5296'>  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,</a>
<a id='line_5297'>  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.</a>
<a id='line_5298'></a>
<a id='line_5299'>  As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,</a>
<a id='line_5300'>  With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills</a>
<a id='line_5301'>  Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5302'>  Roar through a thousand channels to the main:</a>
<a id='line_5303'>  The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;</a>
<a id='line_5304'>  So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.</a>
<a id='line_5305'></a>
<a id='line_5306'>  The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,</a>
<a id='line_5307'>  The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:</a>
<a id='line_5308'>  At great Echepolus the lance arrives,</a>
<a id='line_5309'>  Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;</a>
<a id='line_5310'>  Warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies,</a>
<a id='line_5311'>  And shades eternal settle o'er his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_5312'>  So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood</a>
<a id='line_5313'>  Of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.</a>
<a id='line_5314'>  Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,(140)</a>
<a id='line_5315'>  Seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along:</a>
<a id='line_5316'>  But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,</a>
<a id='line_5317'>  Agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart.</a>
<a id='line_5318'>  His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,</a>
<a id='line_5319'>  Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;</a>
<a id='line_5320'>  The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;</a>
<a id='line_5321'>  The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.</a>
<a id='line_5322'>  Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;</a>
<a id='line_5323'>  The war renews, the warriors bleed again:</a>
<a id='line_5324'>  As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,</a>
<a id='line_5325'>  Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.</a>
<a id='line_5326'></a>
<a id='line_5327'>  In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,</a>
<a id='line_5328'>  Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;</a>
<a id='line_5329'>  Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore</a>
<a id='line_5330'>  Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore:</a>
<a id='line_5331'>  The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,</a>
<a id='line_5332'>  To seek her parents on his flowery side,</a>
<a id='line_5333'>  Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,</a>
<a id='line_5334'>  And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.</a>
<a id='line_5335'>  Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,</a>
<a id='line_5336'>  He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!</a>
<a id='line_5337'>  So falls a poplar, that in watery ground</a>
<a id='line_5338'>  Raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_5339'>  (Fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,</a>
<a id='line_5340'>  To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)</a>
<a id='line_5341'>  Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,</a>
<a id='line_5342'>  With all its beauteous honours on its head</a>
<a id='line_5343'>  There, left a subject to the wind and rain,</a>
<a id='line_5344'>  And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain</a>
<a id='line_5345'>  Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies</a>
<a id='line_5346'>  Stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.</a>
<a id='line_5347'></a>
<a id='line_5348'>  At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;</a>
<a id='line_5349'>  The pointed lance with erring fury flew,</a>
<a id='line_5350'>  And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.</a>
<a id='line_5351'>  He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,</a>
<a id='line_5352'>  And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5353'>  This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,</a>
<a id='line_5354'>  Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;</a>
<a id='line_5355'>  Arm'd with his spear, he meditates the wound,</a>
<a id='line_5356'>  In act to throw; but cautious look'd around,</a>
<a id='line_5357'>  Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,</a>
<a id='line_5358'>  And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.</a>
<a id='line_5359'>  A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,</a>
<a id='line_5360'>  Old Priam's son, Democoon was his name.</a>
<a id='line_5361'>  The weapon entered close above his ear,</a>
<a id='line_5362'>  Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;(141)</a>
<a id='line_5363'>  With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,</a>
<a id='line_5364'>  His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;</a>
<a id='line_5365'>  Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,</a>
<a id='line_5366'>  And his broad buckler rings against the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5367'></a>
<a id='line_5368'>  Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;</a>
<a id='line_5369'>  E'en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;</a>
<a id='line_5370'>  Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;</a>
<a id='line_5371'>  The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:</a>
<a id='line_5372'>  But Phoebus now from Ilion's towering height</a>
<a id='line_5373'>  Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.</a>
<a id='line_5374'>  "Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;</a>
<a id='line_5375'>  Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!</a>
<a id='line_5376'>  Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel;</a>
<a id='line_5377'>  Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.</a>
<a id='line_5378'>  Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?</a>
<a id='line_5379'>  The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more."</a>
<a id='line_5380'></a>
<a id='line_5381'>  Apollo thus from Ilion's lofty towers,</a>
<a id='line_5382'>  Array'd in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:</a>
<a id='line_5383'>  While war's fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,</a>
<a id='line_5384'>  And shouts and thunders in the fields below.</a>
<a id='line_5385'>  Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,</a>
<a id='line_5386'>  In vain his valour and illustrious line.</a>
<a id='line_5387'>  A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,</a>
<a id='line_5388'>  (Who from cold AEnus led the Thracian crew,)(142)</a>
<a id='line_5389'>  Full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,</a>
<a id='line_5390'>  Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.</a>
<a id='line_5391'>  Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,</a>
<a id='line_5392'>  Before his helpless friends, and native bands,</a>
<a id='line_5393'>  And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.</a>
<a id='line_5394'>  The foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,</a>
<a id='line_5395'>  And through his navel drove the pointed death:</a>
<a id='line_5396'>  His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_5397'>  And the warm life came issuing from the wound.</a>
<a id='line_5398'></a>
<a id='line_5399'>  His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,</a>
<a id='line_5400'>  Deep in his breast above the pap it went,</a>
<a id='line_5401'>  Amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood,</a>
<a id='line_5402'>  And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:</a>
<a id='line_5403'>  Till from the dying chief, approaching near,</a>
<a id='line_5404'>  The AEtolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear:</a>
<a id='line_5405'>  Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,</a>
<a id='line_5406'>  And gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound;</a>
<a id='line_5407'>  The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,</a>
<a id='line_5408'>  To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;</a>
<a id='line_5409'>  The Thracian bands against the victor press'd,</a>
<a id='line_5410'>  A grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.</a>
<a id='line_5411'>  Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5412'>  In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.</a>
<a id='line_5413'></a>
<a id='line_5414'>  Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,</a>
<a id='line_5415'>  And one the leader of the Epeian race;</a>
<a id='line_5416'>  Death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5417'>  In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.</a>
<a id='line_5418'>  With copious slaughter all the fields are red,</a>
<a id='line_5419'>  And heap'd with growing mountains of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_5420'></a>
<a id='line_5421'>  Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,</a>
<a id='line_5422'>  By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;</a>
<a id='line_5423'>  Might darts be bid to turn their points away,</a>

<a id='line_5425'>  The war's whole art with wonder had he seen,</a>
<a id='line_5426'>  And counted heroes where he counted men.</a>
<a id='line_5427'></a>
<a id='line_5428'>  So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,</a>
<a id='line_5429'>  And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.</a>

<a id='line_5443'></a>
<a id='line_5444'>THE ACTS OF DIOMED.</a>
<a id='line_5445'></a>
<a id='line_5446'>Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle.</a>
<a id='line_5447'>Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables him</a>
<a id='line_5448'>to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending with any</a>
<a id='line_5449'>of the former, excepting Venus. AEneas joins Pandarus to oppose him;</a>
<a id='line_5450'>Pandarus is killed, and AEneas in great danger but for the assistance of</a>
<a id='line_5451'>Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is wounded on the</a>
<a id='line_5452'>hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at length carries</a>
<a id='line_5453'>off AEneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus. Mars</a>
<a id='line_5454'>rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand. In the meantime</a>
<a id='line_5455'>AEneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks;</a>
<a id='line_5456'>among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend</a>
<a id='line_5457'>to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to go against that god; he</a>
<a id='line_5458'>wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5459'></a>
<a id='line_5460'>The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in</a>
<a id='line_5461'>the former.</a>
<a id='line_5462'></a>
<a id='line_5463'>  But Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,(143)</a>
<a id='line_5464'>  Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,</a>
<a id='line_5465'>  Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,</a>
<a id='line_5466'>  And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.</a>
<a id='line_5467'>  High on his helm celestial lightnings play,</a>
<a id='line_5468'>  His beamy shield emits a living ray;</a>
<a id='line_5469'>  The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,</a>
<a id='line_5470'>  Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,</a>
<a id='line_5471'>  When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,</a>
<a id='line_5472'>  And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.</a>
<a id='line_5473'>  Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_5474'>  Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd:</a>
<a id='line_5475'>  Onward she drives him, furious to engage,</a>
<a id='line_5476'>  Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.</a>
<a id='line_5477'></a>
<a id='line_5478'>  The sons of Dares first the combat sought,</a>
<a id='line_5479'>  A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;</a>
<a id='line_5480'>  In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led,</a>
<a id='line_5481'>  The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;</a>
<a id='line_5482'>  These singled from their troops the fight maintain,</a>
<a id='line_5483'>  These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5484'>  Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,</a>
<a id='line_5485'>  And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,</a>
<a id='line_5486'>  Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,</a>
<a id='line_5487'>  And spent in empty air its erring force.</a>
<a id='line_5488'>  Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,</a>
<a id='line_5489'>  But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5490'>  Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,</a>
<a id='line_5491'>  Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.</a>
<a id='line_5492'>  And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,</a>
<a id='line_5493'>  He too had sunk to death's eternal shade;</a>
<a id='line_5494'>  But in a smoky cloud the god of fire</a>
<a id='line_5495'>  Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.</a>
<a id='line_5496'>  The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,</a>
<a id='line_5497'>  Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.</a>
<a id='line_5498'></a>
<a id='line_5499'>  Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,</a>
<a id='line_5500'>  Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;</a>
<a id='line_5501'>  When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd</a>
<a id='line_5502'>  The god of battles, and this speech address'd:</a>
<a id='line_5503'></a>
<a id='line_5504'>  "Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,</a>
<a id='line_5505'>  Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!</a>
<a id='line_5506'>  Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;</a>
<a id='line_5507'>  And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:</a>
<a id='line_5508'>  While we from interdicted fields retire,</a>
<a id='line_5509'>  Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire."</a>
<a id='line_5510'></a>
<a id='line_5511'>  Her words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,</a>
<a id='line_5512'>  The god of arms and martial maid retreat;</a>
<a id='line_5513'>  Removed from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds</a>
<a id='line_5514'>  They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.</a>
<a id='line_5515'></a>
<a id='line_5516'>  Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,</a>
<a id='line_5517'>  And some bold chieftain every leader slew:</a>
<a id='line_5518'>  First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,</a>
<a id='line_5519'>  His death ennobled by Atrides' hand:</a>
<a id='line_5520'></a>
<a id='line_5521'>  As he to flight his wheeling car address'd,</a>
<a id='line_5522'>  The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.</a>
<a id='line_5523'>  In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,</a>
<a id='line_5524'>  His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.</a>
<a id='line_5525'></a>
<a id='line_5526'>  Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom'd to feel</a>
<a id='line_5527'>  The great Idomeneus' protended steel;</a>
<a id='line_5528'>  Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)</a>
<a id='line_5529'>  From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_5530'>  The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,</a>
<a id='line_5531'>  And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;</a>
<a id='line_5532'>  Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,</a>
<a id='line_5533'>  And everlasting shades his eyes surround.</a>
<a id='line_5534'></a>
<a id='line_5535'>  Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,</a>
<a id='line_5536'>  In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;</a>
<a id='line_5537'>  Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,</a>
<a id='line_5538'>  To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:</a>
<a id='line_5539'>  But vainly here Diana's arts he tries,</a>
<a id='line_5540'>  The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;</a>
<a id='line_5541'>  From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,</a>
<a id='line_5542'>  Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:</a>
<a id='line_5543'>  Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,</a>
<a id='line_5544'>  His brazen armour rings against the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5545'></a>
<a id='line_5546'>  Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;</a>
<a id='line_5547'>  Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.</a>
<a id='line_5548'>  Thy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine,</a>
<a id='line_5549'>  The graceful fabric and the fair design;</a>
<a id='line_5550'>  For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart</a>
<a id='line_5551'>  To him the shipwright's and the builder's art.</a>
<a id='line_5552'>  Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,</a>
<a id='line_5553'>  The fatal cause of all his country's woes;</a>
<a id='line_5554'>  But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,</a>
<a id='line_5555'>  Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.</a>
<a id='line_5556'>  The hapless artist, while confused he fled,</a>
<a id='line_5557'>  The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.</a>
<a id='line_5558'>  Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,</a>
<a id='line_5559'>  Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd;</a>
<a id='line_5560'>  Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,</a>
<a id='line_5561'>  And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_5562'></a>
<a id='line_5563'>  From Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled,</a>
<a id='line_5564'>  Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed,</a>
<a id='line_5565'>  Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,</a>
<a id='line_5566'>  Nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.</a>
<a id='line_5567'>  How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear</a>
<a id='line_5568'>  Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;</a>
<a id='line_5569'>  Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,</a>
<a id='line_5570'>  And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</a>
<a id='line_5571'></a>
<a id='line_5572'>  Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,</a>
<a id='line_5573'>  Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,</a>
<a id='line_5574'>  Who near adored Scamander made abode,</a>
<a id='line_5575'>  Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.</a>
<a id='line_5576'>  On him, amidst the flying numbers found,</a>
<a id='line_5577'>  Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;</a>
<a id='line_5578'>  On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,</a>
<a id='line_5579'>  Thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,</a>
<a id='line_5580'>  Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.</a>
<a id='line_5581'>  Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death</a>
<a id='line_5582'>  Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.</a>
<a id='line_5583'></a>
<a id='line_5584'>  Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.</a>
<a id='line_5585'>  In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;</a>
<a id='line_5586'>  Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,</a>
<a id='line_5587'>  Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;</a>
<a id='line_5588'>  Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,</a>
<a id='line_5589'>  Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.</a>
<a id='line_5590'>  Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong</a>
<a id='line_5591'>  Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,</a>
<a id='line_5592'>  Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,</a>
<a id='line_5593'>  O'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;</a>
<a id='line_5594'>  The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,</a>
<a id='line_5595'>  And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!(144)</a>
<a id='line_5596'>  While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,</a>
<a id='line_5597'>  And all the labours of mankind are vain.</a>
<a id='line_5598'></a>
<a id='line_5599'>  So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,</a>
<a id='line_5600'>  Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.</a>
<a id='line_5601'>  With grief the leader of the Lycian band</a>
<a id='line_5602'>  Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:</a>
<a id='line_5603'>  His bended bow against the chief he drew;</a>
<a id='line_5604'>  Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,</a>
<a id='line_5605'>  Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,</a>
<a id='line_5606'>  Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:</a>
<a id='line_5607'>  The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,</a>
<a id='line_5608'>  While the proud archer thus exulting cried:</a>
<a id='line_5609'></a>
<a id='line_5610'>  "Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!</a>
<a id='line_5611'>  Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,</a>
<a id='line_5612'>  Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;</a>
<a id='line_5613'>  Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain."</a>
<a id='line_5614'>  So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart</a>
<a id='line_5615'>  Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.</a>
<a id='line_5616'>  The wounded chief, behind his car retired,</a>
<a id='line_5617'>  The helping hand of Sthenelus required;</a>
<a id='line_5618'>  Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_5619'>  And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound;</a>
<a id='line_5620'>  When thus the king his guardian power address'd,</a>
<a id='line_5621'>  The purple current wandering o'er his vest:</a>
<a id='line_5622'></a>
<a id='line_5623'>  "O progeny of Jove! unconquer'd maid!</a>
<a id='line_5624'>  If e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,</a>
<a id='line_5625'>  If e'er I felt thee in the fighting field;</a>
<a id='line_5626'>  Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.</a>
<a id='line_5627'>  O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,</a>
<a id='line_5628'>  Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard'st in fight;</a>
<a id='line_5629'>  And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,</a>
<a id='line_5630'>  That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more."</a>
<a id='line_5631'></a>
<a id='line_5632'>  Thus pray'd Tydides, and Minerva heard,</a>
<a id='line_5633'>  His nerves confirm'd, his languid spirits cheer'd;</a>
<a id='line_5634'>  He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;</a>
<a id='line_5635'>  His beating bosom claim'd the promised fight.</a>
<a id='line_5636'>  "Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,</a>
<a id='line_5637'>  War be thy province, thy protection mine;</a>
<a id='line_5638'>  Rush to the fight, and every foe control;</a>
<a id='line_5639'>  Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:</a>
<a id='line_5640'>  Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,</a>
<a id='line_5641'>  And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;</a>
<a id='line_5642'>  Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,(145)</a>
<a id='line_5643'>  And set to view the warring deities.</a>
<a id='line_5644'>  These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;</a>
<a id='line_5645'>  Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.</a>
<a id='line_5646'>  If Venus mingle in the martial band,</a>
<a id='line_5647'>  Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command."</a>
<a id='line_5648'></a>
<a id='line_5649'>  With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing'd her flight;</a>
<a id='line_5650'>  The hero rush'd impetuous to the fight;</a>
<a id='line_5651'>  With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,</a>
<a id='line_5652'>  Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.</a>
<a id='line_5653'>  As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,</a>
<a id='line_5654'>  Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;</a>
<a id='line_5655'>  If chance some shepherd with a distant dart</a>
<a id='line_5656'>  The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,</a>
<a id='line_5657'>  He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,</a>
<a id='line_5658'>  But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;</a>
<a id='line_5659'>  Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,</a>
<a id='line_5660'>  Then leaps victorious o'er the lofty mound.</a>
<a id='line_5661'>  Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;</a>
<a id='line_5662'>  And two brave leaders at an instant slew;</a>
<a id='line_5663'>  Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,</a>
<a id='line_5664'>  His people's pastor, good Hypenor, died;</a>
<a id='line_5665'>  Astynous' breast the deadly lance receives,</a>
<a id='line_5666'>  Hypenor's shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.</a>
<a id='line_5667'>  Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage</a>
<a id='line_5668'>  Abas and Polyidus to engage;</a>
<a id='line_5669'>  Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,</a>
<a id='line_5670'>  Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;</a>
<a id='line_5671'>  The youths return'd not from the doubtful plain,</a>
<a id='line_5672'>  And the sad father tried his arts in vain;</a>
<a id='line_5673'>  No mystic dream could make their fates appear,</a>
<a id='line_5674'>  Though now determined by Tydides' spear.</a>
<a id='line_5675'></a>
<a id='line_5676'>  Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;</a>
<a id='line_5677'>  The joy and hope of Phaenops' feeble age:</a>
<a id='line_5678'>  Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs</a>
<a id='line_5679'>  Of all his labours and a life of cares.</a>
<a id='line_5680'>  Cold death o'ertakes them in their blooming years,</a>
<a id='line_5681'>  And leaves the father unavailing tears:</a>
<a id='line_5682'>  To strangers now descends his heapy store,</a>
<a id='line_5683'>  The race forgotten, and the name no more.</a>
<a id='line_5684'></a>
<a id='line_5685'>  Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,</a>
<a id='line_5686'>  Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.</a>
<a id='line_5687'>  As when the lordly lion seeks his food</a>
<a id='line_5688'>  Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,</a>
<a id='line_5689'>  He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,</a>
<a id='line_5690'>  Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:</a>
<a id='line_5691'>  So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,</a>
<a id='line_5692'>  Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.</a>
<a id='line_5693'></a>
<a id='line_5694'>  With deep concern divine AEneas view'd</a>
<a id='line_5695'>  The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;</a>
<a id='line_5696'>  Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,</a>
<a id='line_5697'>  Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.</a>
<a id='line_5698'>  At length he found Lycaon's mighty son;</a>
<a id='line_5699'>  To whom the chief of Venus' race begun:</a>
<a id='line_5700'></a>
<a id='line_5701'>  "Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,</a>
<a id='line_5702'>  Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,</a>
<a id='line_5703'>  Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,</a>
<a id='line_5704'>  And boasted glory of the Lycian name?</a>
<a id='line_5705'>  O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call</a>
<a id='line_5706'>  That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;</a>
<a id='line_5707'>  Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies</a>
<a id='line_5708'>  To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;</a>
<a id='line_5709'>  (Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!</a>
<a id='line_5710'>  For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?</a>
<a id='line_5711'>  Whoe'er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;</a>
<a id='line_5712'>  If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare."</a>
<a id='line_5713'></a>
<a id='line_5714'>  To him the Lycian: "Whom your eyes behold,</a>
<a id='line_5715'>  If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:</a>
<a id='line_5716'>  Such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,</a>
<a id='line_5717'>  So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.</a>
<a id='line_5718'>  If 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise:</a>
<a id='line_5719'>  Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,</a>
<a id='line_5720'>  Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,</a>
<a id='line_5721'>  And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.</a>
<a id='line_5722'>  I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell,</a>
<a id='line_5723'>  The stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell;</a>
<a id='line_5724'>  And, but some god, some angry god withstands,</a>
<a id='line_5725'>  His fate was due to these unerring hands.</a>
<a id='line_5726'>  Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war,</a>
<a id='line_5727'>  Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.</a>
<a id='line_5728'>  Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,</a>
<a id='line_5729'>  And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome:</a>
<a id='line_5730'>  There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand;</a>
<a id='line_5731'>  And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.</a>
<a id='line_5732'>  The good old warrior bade me trust to these,</a>
<a id='line_5733'>  When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas;</a>
<a id='line_5734'>  In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,</a>
<a id='line_5735'>  And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.</a>
<a id='line_5736'>  But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,</a>
<a id='line_5737'>  I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,</a>
<a id='line_5738'>  And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)</a>
<a id='line_5739'>  Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town;</a>
<a id='line_5740'>  So took my bow and pointed darts in hand</a>
<a id='line_5741'>  And left the chariots in my native land.</a>
<a id='line_5742'></a>
<a id='line_5743'>  "Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;</a>
<a id='line_5744'>  These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.</a>
<a id='line_5745'>  Tydeus' and Atreus' sons their points have found,</a>
<a id='line_5746'>  And undissembled gore pursued the wound.</a>
<a id='line_5747'>  In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow</a>
<a id='line_5748'>  Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.</a>
<a id='line_5749'>  In evil hour these bended horns I strung,</a>
<a id='line_5750'>  And seized the quiver where it idly hung.</a>
<a id='line_5751'>  Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field</a>
<a id='line_5752'>  Without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield!</a>
<a id='line_5753'>  If e'er with life I quit the Trojan plain,</a>
<a id='line_5754'>  If e'er I see my spouse and sire again,</a>
<a id='line_5755'>  This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,</a>
<a id='line_5756'>  Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames."</a>
<a id='line_5757'></a>
<a id='line_5758'>  To whom the leader of the Dardan race:</a>
<a id='line_5759'>  "Be calm, nor Phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace.</a>
<a id='line_5760'>  The distant dart be praised, though here we need</a>
<a id='line_5761'>  The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.</a>
<a id='line_5762'>  Against yon hero let us bend our course,</a>
<a id='line_5763'>  And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.</a>
<a id='line_5764'>  Now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height</a>
<a id='line_5765'>  Observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight;</a>
<a id='line_5766'>  Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,</a>

<a id='line_5768'>  Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;</a>
<a id='line_5769'>  Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.</a>
<a id='line_5770'>  Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;</a>
<a id='line_5771'>  The warrior's fury let this arm sustain;</a>
<a id='line_5772'>  Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,</a>
<a id='line_5773'>  Take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine."</a>
<a id='line_5774'></a>
<a id='line_5775'>  "O prince! (Lycaon's valiant son replied)</a>
<a id='line_5776'>  As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.</a>
<a id='line_5777'>  The horses, practised to their lord's command,</a>
<a id='line_5778'>  Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;</a>
<a id='line_5779'>  But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,</a>
<a id='line_5780'>  Thy voice alone can animate their flight;</a>
<a id='line_5781'>  Else shall our fates be number'd with the dead,</a>
<a id='line_5782'>  And these, the victor's prize, in triumph led.</a>
<a id='line_5783'>  Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield</a>
<a id='line_5784'>  Myself will charge this terror of the field."</a>
<a id='line_5785'></a>
<a id='line_5786'>  And now both heroes mount the glittering car;</a>
<a id='line_5787'>  The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;</a>
<a id='line_5788'>  Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,</a>
<a id='line_5789'>  Who thus, alarm'd, to great Tydides cried:</a>
<a id='line_5790'></a>
<a id='line_5791'>  "O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,</a>
<a id='line_5792'>  Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:</a>
<a id='line_5793'>  Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon's line,</a>
<a id='line_5794'>  And great AEneas, sprung from race divine!</a>
<a id='line_5795'>  Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!</a>
<a id='line_5796'>  And save a life, the bulwark of our war."</a>
<a id='line_5797'></a>
<a id='line_5798'>  At this the hero cast a gloomy look,</a>
<a id='line_5799'>  Fix'd on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_5800'></a>
<a id='line_5801'>  "Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?</a>
<a id='line_5802'>  Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?</a>
<a id='line_5803'>  Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,</a>
<a id='line_5804'>  Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.</a>
<a id='line_5805'>  I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,</a>
<a id='line_5806'>  And the long distance of the flying lance;</a>
<a id='line_5807'>  But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,</a>
<a id='line_5808'>  Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.</a>
<a id='line_5809'>  Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey</a>
<a id='line_5810'>  Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;</a>
<a id='line_5811'>  One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;</a>
<a id='line_5812'>  So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.</a>
<a id='line_5813'>  But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,</a>
<a id='line_5814'>  That both shall fall by one victorious hand,</a>
<a id='line_5815'>  Then heed my words: my horses here detain,</a>
<a id='line_5816'>  Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein;</a>
<a id='line_5817'>  Swift to AEneas' empty seat proceed,</a>
<a id='line_5818'>  And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;</a>
<a id='line_5819'>  The race of those, which once the thundering god(146)</a>
<a id='line_5820'>  For ravish'd Ganymede on Tros bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_5821'>  The best that e'er on earth's broad surface run,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>  Beneath the rising or the setting sun.</a>
<a id='line_5823'>  Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,</a>
<a id='line_5824'>  By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:</a>
<a id='line_5825'>  Four of this race his ample stalls contain,</a>
<a id='line_5826'>  And two transport AEneas o'er the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5827'>  These, were the rich immortal prize our own,</a>
<a id='line_5828'>  Through the wide world should make our glory known."</a>
<a id='line_5829'></a>
<a id='line_5830'>  Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,</a>
<a id='line_5831'>  And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun:</a>
<a id='line_5832'></a>
<a id='line_5833'>  "Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail'd,</a>
<a id='line_5834'>  The spear may enter where the arrow fail'd."</a>
<a id='line_5835'></a>
<a id='line_5836'>  He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;</a>
<a id='line_5837'>  On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,</a>
<a id='line_5838'>  Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,</a>
<a id='line_5839'>  "He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)</a>
<a id='line_5840'>  Our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!"</a>
<a id='line_5841'>  "Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)</a>
<a id='line_5842'>  Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;</a>
<a id='line_5843'>  Ye 'scape not both; one, headlong from his car,</a>
<a id='line_5844'>  With hostile blood shall glut the god of war."</a>
<a id='line_5845'></a>
<a id='line_5846'>  He spoke, and rising hurl'd his forceful dart,</a>
<a id='line_5847'>  Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;</a>
<a id='line_5848'>  Full in his face it enter'd, and betwixt</a>
<a id='line_5849'>  The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix'd;</a>
<a id='line_5850'>  Crash'd all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,</a>
<a id='line_5851'>  Till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.</a>
<a id='line_5852'>  Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:</a>
<a id='line_5853'>  Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;</a>
<a id='line_5854'>  The starting coursers tremble with affright;</a>
<a id='line_5855'>  The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.</a>
<a id='line_5856'></a>
<a id='line_5857'>  To guard his slaughter'd friend, AEneas flies,</a>
<a id='line_5858'>  His spear extending where the carcase lies;</a>
<a id='line_5859'>  Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>  As the grim lion stalks around his prey.</a>
<a id='line_5861'>  O'er the fall'n trunk his ample shield display'd,</a>
<a id='line_5862'>  He hides the hero with his mighty shade,</a>
<a id='line_5863'>  And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes</a>
<a id='line_5864'>  Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.</a>
<a id='line_5865'>  Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields</a>
<a id='line_5866'>  Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.</a>
<a id='line_5867'>  Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,</a>
<a id='line_5868'>  Such men as live in these degenerate days:(147)</a>
<a id='line_5869'>  He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,</a>
<a id='line_5870'>  Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.</a>
<a id='line_5871'>  Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,</a>
<a id='line_5872'>  Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;</a>
<a id='line_5873'>  Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,</a>
<a id='line_5874'>  And stripp'd the skin, and crack'd the solid bone.</a>
<a id='line_5875'>  Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,</a>
<a id='line_5876'>  His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;</a>
<a id='line_5877'>  Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;</a>
<a id='line_5878'>  A sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_5879'>  There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd,</a>
<a id='line_5880'>  Oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade,</a>
<a id='line_5881'>  But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love</a>
<a id='line_5882'>  She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove,</a>
<a id='line_5883'>  His danger views with anguish and despair,</a>
<a id='line_5884'>  And guards her offspring with a mother's care.</a>
<a id='line_5885'>  About her much-loved son her arms she throws,</a>
<a id='line_5886'>  Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.</a>
<a id='line_5887'>  Screen'd from the foe behind her shining veil,</a>
<a id='line_5888'>  The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;</a>
<a id='line_5889'>  Safe through the rushing horse, and feather'd flight</a>
<a id='line_5890'>  Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.</a>
<a id='line_5891'></a>
<a id='line_5892'>  Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,</a>
<a id='line_5893'>  Remain'd unheedful of his lord's commands:</a>
<a id='line_5894'>  His panting steeds, removed from out the war,</a>
<a id='line_5895'>  He fix'd with straiten'd traces to the car,</a>
<a id='line_5896'>  Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains</a>
<a id='line_5897'>  The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:</a>
<a id='line_5898'>  These in proud triumph to the fleet convey'd,</a>
<a id='line_5899'>  No longer now a Trojan lord obey'd.</a>
<a id='line_5900'>  That charge to bold Deipylus he gave,</a>
<a id='line_5901'>  (Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)</a>
<a id='line_5902'>  Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,</a>
<a id='line_5903'>  And follow'd where Tydides swept the plain.</a>
<a id='line_5904'></a>
<a id='line_5905'>  Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)</a>
<a id='line_5906'>  The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:</a>
<a id='line_5907'>  No goddess she, commission'd to the field,</a>
<a id='line_5908'>  Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,</a>
<a id='line_5909'>  Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,</a>
<a id='line_5910'>  While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;</a>
<a id='line_5911'>  He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,</a>
<a id='line_5912'>  New to the field, and still a foe to fame.</a>
<a id='line_5913'>  Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,</a>
<a id='line_5914'>  And at the goddess his broad lance extends;</a>
<a id='line_5915'>  Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,</a>
<a id='line_5916'>  The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove;</a>
<a id='line_5917'>  Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,</a>
<a id='line_5918'>  And the transparent skin with crimson stain'd,</a>
<a id='line_5919'>  From the clear vein a stream immortal flow'd,</a>
<a id='line_5920'>  Such stream as issues from a wounded god;(148)</a>
<a id='line_5921'>  Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!</a>
<a id='line_5922'>  Unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:</a>
<a id='line_5923'>  (For not the bread of man their life sustains,</a>
<a id='line_5924'>  Nor wine's inflaming juice supplies their veins:)</a>
<a id='line_5925'>  With tender shrieks the goddess fill'd the place,</a>
<a id='line_5926'>  And dropp'd her offspring from her weak embrace.</a>
<a id='line_5927'>  Him Phoebus took: he casts a cloud around</a>
<a id='line_5928'>  The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.</a>
<a id='line_5929'></a>
<a id='line_5930'>  Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,</a>
<a id='line_5931'>  The king insults the goddess as she flies:</a>
<a id='line_5932'>  "Ill with Jove's daughter bloody fights agree,</a>
<a id='line_5933'>  The field of combat is no scene for thee:</a>
<a id='line_5934'>  Go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,</a>
<a id='line_5935'>  Go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.</a>
<a id='line_5936'>  Taught by this stroke renounce the war's alarms,</a>
<a id='line_5937'>  And learn to tremble at the name of arms."</a>
<a id='line_5938'></a>
<a id='line_5939'>  Tydides thus. The goddess, seized with dread,</a>
<a id='line_5940'>  Confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.</a>
<a id='line_5941'>  To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew,</a>
<a id='line_5942'>  Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.</a>
<a id='line_5943'>  The queen of love with faded charms she found.</a>
<a id='line_5944'>  Pale was her cheek, and livid look'd the wound.</a>
<a id='line_5945'>  To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way:</a>
<a id='line_5946'>  Far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay;</a>
<a id='line_5947'>  Beside him stood his lance, distain'd with gore,</a>
<a id='line_5948'>  And, rein'd with gold, his foaming steeds before.</a>
<a id='line_5949'>  Low at his knee, she begg'd with streaming eyes</a>
<a id='line_5950'>  Her brother's car, to mount the distant skies,</a>
<a id='line_5951'>  And show'd the wound by fierce Tydides given,</a>
<a id='line_5952'>  A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.</a>
<a id='line_5953'>  Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,</a>
<a id='line_5954'>  And to her hand commits the golden rein;</a>
<a id='line_5955'>  She mounts the seat, oppress'd with silent woe,</a>
<a id='line_5956'>  Driven by the goddess of the painted bow.</a>
<a id='line_5957'>  The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,</a>
<a id='line_5958'>  And in a moment scales the lofty skies:</a>
<a id='line_5959'>  They stopp'd the car, and there the coursers stood,</a>
<a id='line_5960'>  Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food;</a>
<a id='line_5961'>  Before her mother, love's bright queen appears,</a>
<a id='line_5962'>  O'erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:</a>
<a id='line_5963'>  She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,</a>
<a id='line_5964'>  And ask'd what god had wrought this guilty deed?</a>
<a id='line_5965'></a>
<a id='line_5966'>  [Illustration: VENUS, WOUNDED IN THE HAND, CONDUCTED BY IRIS TO MARS.]</a>

<a id='line_6028'>  Allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,</a>
<a id='line_6029'>  To quit her country for some youth of Troy;</a>
<a id='line_6030'>  The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,</a>
<a id='line_6031'>  Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound."</a>
<a id='line_6032'></a>
<a id='line_6033'>  The sire of gods and men superior smiled,</a>
<a id='line_6034'>  And, calling Venus, thus address'd his child:</a>
<a id='line_6035'>  "Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares,</a>
<a id='line_6036'>  Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;</a>
<a id='line_6037'>  Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;</a>
<a id='line_6038'>  To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms."</a>
<a id='line_6039'></a>
<a id='line_6040'>  Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below</a>
<a id='line_6041'>  The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe,</a>
<a id='line_6042'>  Flush'd with celestial blood pursued his way,</a>
<a id='line_6043'>  And fearless dared the threatening god of day;</a>
<a id='line_6044'>  Already in his hopes he saw him kill'd,</a>
<a id='line_6045'>  Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield.</a>
<a id='line_6046'>  Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;</a>
<a id='line_6047'>  His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:</a>
<a id='line_6048'>  He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,</a>
<a id='line_6049'>  A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</a>
<a id='line_6050'></a>
<a id='line_6051'>  "O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see</a>
<a id='line_6052'>  How vast the difference of the gods and thee;</a>
<a id='line_6053'>  Distance immense! between the powers that shine</a>

<a id='line_6062'>  Latona there and Phoebe heal'd the wound,</a>
<a id='line_6063'>  With vigour arm'd him, and with glory crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_6064'>  This done, the patron of the silver bow</a>
<a id='line_6065'>  A phantom raised, the same in shape and show</a>
<a id='line_6066'>  With great AEneas; such the form he bore,</a>
<a id='line_6067'>  And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.</a>
<a id='line_6068'>  Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,</a>
<a id='line_6069'>  And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.</a>
<a id='line_6070'>  Meantime on Ilion's tower Apollo stood,</a>
<a id='line_6071'>  And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god:</a>
<a id='line_6072'></a>
<a id='line_6073'>  "Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;</a>
<a id='line_6074'>  Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,</a>
<a id='line_6075'>  Rise in thy wrath! to hell's abhorr'd abodes</a>
<a id='line_6076'>  Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.</a>
<a id='line_6077'>  First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;</a>

<a id='line_6080'>  His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire."</a>
<a id='line_6081'></a>
<a id='line_6082'>  The god of battle issues on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_6083'>  Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;</a>
<a id='line_6084'>  In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,</a>
<a id='line_6085'>  Enraged to Troy's retiring chiefs he cried:</a>
<a id='line_6086'></a>
<a id='line_6087'>  "How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,</a>
<a id='line_6088'>  And unrevenged see Priam's people die?</a>
<a id='line_6089'>  Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,</a>
<a id='line_6090'>  And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?</a>
<a id='line_6091'>  Lo, brave AEneas sinks beneath his wound,</a>
<a id='line_6092'>  Not godlike Hector more in arms renown'd:</a>
<a id='line_6093'>  Haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.</a>
<a id='line_6094'>  He said;--new courage swell'd each hero's heart.</a>
<a id='line_6095'>  Sarpedon first his ardent soul express'd,</a>
<a id='line_6096'>  And, turn'd to Hector, these bold words address'd:</a>
<a id='line_6097'></a>
<a id='line_6098'>  "Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?</a>
<a id='line_6099'>  Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,</a>
<a id='line_6100'>  That propp'd alone by Priam's race should stand</a>
<a id='line_6101'>  Troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?</a>
<a id='line_6102'>  Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,</a>
<a id='line_6103'>  And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.</a>
<a id='line_6104'>  Remote they stand while alien troops engage,</a>
<a id='line_6105'>  Like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.</a>
<a id='line_6106'>  Far distant hence I held my wide command,</a>
<a id='line_6107'>  Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;</a>
<a id='line_6108'>  With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless'd,</a>
<a id='line_6109'>  A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;</a>
<a id='line_6110'>  With those I left whatever dear could be:</a>
<a id='line_6111'>  Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;</a>
<a id='line_6112'>  Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,</a>
<a id='line_6113'>  And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;</a>
<a id='line_6114'>  While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave</a>
<a id='line_6115'>  Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.</a>
<a id='line_6116'>  Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state,</a>
<a id='line_6117'>  Or one vast burst of all-involving fate</a>
<a id='line_6118'>  Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away</a>
<a id='line_6119'>  Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.</a>
<a id='line_6120'>  Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;</a>
<a id='line_6121'>  These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;</a>
<a id='line_6122'>  With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;</a>
<a id='line_6123'>  Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes."</a>
<a id='line_6124'></a>
<a id='line_6125'>  Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,</a>
<a id='line_6126'>  But just reproof with decent silence bears.</a>
<a id='line_6127'>  From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,</a>
<a id='line_6128'>  On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.</a>
<a id='line_6129'>  Two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands;</a>
<a id='line_6130'>  Thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,</a>
<a id='line_6131'>  Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,</a>
<a id='line_6132'>  And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.</a>
<a id='line_6133'>  They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,</a>
<a id='line_6134'>  Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.</a>
<a id='line_6135'></a>
<a id='line_6136'>  As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain</a>
<a id='line_6137'>  Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,</a>
<a id='line_6138'>  And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,</a>
<a id='line_6139'>  Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;</a>
<a id='line_6140'>  The grey dust, rising with collected winds,</a>
<a id='line_6141'>  Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:</a>
<a id='line_6142'>  So white with dust the Grecian host appears.</a>
<a id='line_6143'>  From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers;</a>
<a id='line_6144'>  The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,</a>
<a id='line_6145'>  And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_6146'>  Mars hovers o'er them with his sable shield,</a>
<a id='line_6147'>  And adds new horrors to the darken'd field:</a>
<a id='line_6148'>  Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,</a>
<a id='line_6149'>  In Troy's defence, Apollo's heavenly will:</a>
<a id='line_6150'>  Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,</a>
<a id='line_6151'>  Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.</a>
<a id='line_6152'>  And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,</a>
<a id='line_6153'>  Produced AEneas to the shouting train;</a>
<a id='line_6154'>  Alive, unharm'd, with all his peers around,</a>
<a id='line_6155'>  Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:</a>
<a id='line_6156'>  Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day</a>
<a id='line_6157'>  No pause of words admits, no dull delay;</a>
<a id='line_6158'>  Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,</a>
<a id='line_6159'>  Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.</a>
<a id='line_6160'></a>
<a id='line_6161'>  Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,</a>
<a id='line_6162'>  And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.</a>
<a id='line_6163'>  Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train</a>
<a id='line_6164'>  The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.</a>
<a id='line_6165'>  Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait</a>
<a id='line_6166'>  Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.</a>
<a id='line_6167'>  So when the embattled clouds in dark array,</a>
<a id='line_6168'>  Along the skies their gloomy lines display;</a>
<a id='line_6169'>  When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,</a>
<a id='line_6170'>  And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:</a>
<a id='line_6171'>  The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,</a>
<a id='line_6172'>  Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;</a>
<a id='line_6173'>  Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,</a>
<a id='line_6174'>  Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.</a>
<a id='line_6175'></a>
<a id='line_6176'>  Nor was the general wanting to his train;</a>
<a id='line_6177'>  From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,</a>
<a id='line_6178'>  "Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;</a>
<a id='line_6179'>  Your brave associates and yourselves revere!</a>
<a id='line_6180'>  Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,</a>
<a id='line_6181'>  And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!</a>
<a id='line_6182'>  On valour's side the odds of combat lie,</a>
<a id='line_6183'>  The brave live glorious, or lamented die;</a>
<a id='line_6184'>  The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,</a>
<a id='line_6185'>  Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!"</a>
<a id='line_6186'></a>
<a id='line_6187'>  These words he seconds with his flying lance,</a>
<a id='line_6188'>  To meet whose point was strong Deicoon's chance:</a>
<a id='line_6189'>  AEneas' friend, and in his native place</a>
<a id='line_6190'>  Honour'd and loved like Priam's royal race:</a>
<a id='line_6191'>  Long had he fought the foremost in the field,</a>
<a id='line_6192'>  But now the monarch's lance transpierced his shield:</a>
<a id='line_6193'>  His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,</a>
<a id='line_6194'>  Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:</a>
<a id='line_6195'>  The grisly wound dismiss'd his soul to hell,</a>
<a id='line_6196'>  His arms around him rattled as he fell.</a>
<a id='line_6197'></a>
<a id='line_6198'>  Then fierce AEneas, brandishing his blade,</a>
<a id='line_6199'>  In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,</a>
<a id='line_6200'>  Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,</a>
<a id='line_6201'>  In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:(152)</a>
<a id='line_6202'>  Sprung from Alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields</a>
<a id='line_6203'>  Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.</a>
<a id='line_6204'>  He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,</a>
<a id='line_6205'>  And these descended in the third degree.</a>
<a id='line_6206'>  Too early expert in the martial toil,</a>
<a id='line_6207'>  In sable ships they left their native soil,</a>
<a id='line_6208'>  To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,</a>
<a id='line_6209'>  They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.</a>
<a id='line_6210'>  So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood</a>
<a id='line_6211'>  In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,</a>
<a id='line_6212'>  Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd</a>
<a id='line_6213'>  Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:</a>
<a id='line_6214'>  Till pierced at distance from their native den,</a>
<a id='line_6215'>  O'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.</a>
<a id='line_6216'>  Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,</a>
<a id='line_6217'>  Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.</a>
<a id='line_6218'>  Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,</a>
<a id='line_6219'>  Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;</a>
<a id='line_6220'>  Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,</a>
<a id='line_6221'>  The god but urged him to provoke his fate.</a>
<a id='line_6222'>  He thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son</a>
<a id='line_6223'>  Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;</a>
<a id='line_6224'>  Struck with the thought, should Helen's lord be slain,</a>
<a id='line_6225'>  And all his country's glorious labours vain.</a>
<a id='line_6226'>  Already met, the threatening heroes stand;</a>
<a id='line_6227'>  The spears already tremble in their hand:</a>
<a id='line_6228'>  In rush'd Antilochus, his aid to bring,</a>
<a id='line_6229'>  And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.</a>
<a id='line_6230'>  These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his course,</a>
<a id='line_6231'>  Brave as he was, and shunn'd unequal force.</a>
<a id='line_6232'>  The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,</a>
<a id='line_6233'>  Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.</a>
<a id='line_6234'></a>
<a id='line_6235'>  First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,</a>
<a id='line_6236'>  Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.</a>
<a id='line_6237'>  Atrides mark'd him where sublime he stood;</a>
<a id='line_6238'>  Fix'd in his throat the javelin drank his blood.</a>
<a id='line_6239'>  The faithful Mydon, as he turn'd from fight</a>
<a id='line_6240'>  His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;</a>
<a id='line_6241'>  A broken rock by Nestor's son was thrown:</a>
<a id='line_6242'>  His bended arm received the falling stone;</a>
<a id='line_6243'>  From his numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins,</a>
<a id='line_6244'>  Dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains:</a>
<a id='line_6245'>  Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;</a>
<a id='line_6246'>  He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:</a>
<a id='line_6247'>  Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there</a>
<a id='line_6248'>  The head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,</a>
<a id='line_6249'>  Till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet:</a>
<a id='line_6250'>  The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,</a>
<a id='line_6251'>  And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.</a>
<a id='line_6252'></a>
<a id='line_6253'>  Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,</a>
<a id='line_6254'>  Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:</a>
<a id='line_6255'>  He fires his host with animating cries,</a>
<a id='line_6256'>  And brings along the furies of the skies,</a>
<a id='line_6257'>  Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,</a>
<a id='line_6258'>  Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:</a>
<a id='line_6259'>  This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;</a>
<a id='line_6260'>  That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.</a>
<a id='line_6261'>  Where Hector march'd, the god of battles shined,</a>
<a id='line_6262'>  Now storm'd before him, and now raged behind.</a>
<a id='line_6263'></a>
<a id='line_6264'>  Tydides paused amidst his full career;</a>
<a id='line_6265'>  Then first the hero's manly breast knew fear.</a>
<a id='line_6266'>  As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,</a>
<a id='line_6267'>  And wide through fens an unknown journey takes:</a>
<a id='line_6268'>  If chance a swelling brook his passage stay,</a>
<a id='line_6269'>  And foam impervious 'cross the wanderer's way,</a>
<a id='line_6270'>  Confused he stops, a length of country pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_6271'>  Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.</a>
<a id='line_6272'>  Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:</a>
<a id='line_6273'>  He stay'd, and turning thus address'd his bands:</a>
<a id='line_6274'></a>
<a id='line_6275'>  "No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield;</a>
<a id='line_6276'>  Secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;</a>
<a id='line_6277'>  His strokes they second, and avert our spears.</a>
<a id='line_6278'>  Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!</a>
<a id='line_6279'>  Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;</a>
<a id='line_6280'>  Retire, but with your faces to the foe.</a>
<a id='line_6281'>  Trust not too much your unavailing might;</a>
<a id='line_6282'>  'Tis not with Troy, but with the gods ye fight."</a>
<a id='line_6283'></a>
<a id='line_6284'>  Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;</a>
<a id='line_6285'>  And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:</a>
<a id='line_6286'>  His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,</a>
<a id='line_6287'>  In every art of glorious war renown'd;</a>
<a id='line_6288'>  In the same car the chiefs to combat ride,</a>
<a id='line_6289'>  And fought united, and united died.</a>
<a id='line_6290'>  Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows</a>
<a id='line_6291'>  With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.</a>
<a id='line_6292'>  His massy spear with matchless fury sent,</a>
<a id='line_6293'>  Through Amphius' belt and heaving belly went;</a>
<a id='line_6294'>  Amphius Apaesus' happy soil possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_6295'>  With herds abounding, and with treasure bless'd;</a>
<a id='line_6296'>  But fate resistless from his country led</a>
<a id='line_6297'>  The chief, to perish at his people's head.</a>
<a id='line_6298'>  Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,</a>
<a id='line_6299'>  And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;</a>
<a id='line_6300'>  Around his head an iron tempest rain'd;</a>
<a id='line_6301'>  A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd:</a>
<a id='line_6302'>  Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd,</a>
<a id='line_6303'>  And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:</a>
<a id='line_6304'>  He could no more; the showering darts denied</a>
<a id='line_6305'>  To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.</a>
<a id='line_6306'>  Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,</a>
<a id='line_6307'>  With bristling lances, and compacted shields;</a>
<a id='line_6308'>  Till in the steely circle straiten'd round,</a>
<a id='line_6309'>  Forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.</a>
<a id='line_6310'></a>
<a id='line_6311'>  While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,(153)</a>
<a id='line_6312'>  Urged by the force of unresisted fate,</a>
<a id='line_6313'>  Burns with desire Sarpedon's strength to prove;</a>
<a id='line_6314'>  Alcides' offspring meets the son of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_6315'>  Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.</a>
<a id='line_6316'>  Jove's great descendant, and his greater son.</a>
<a id='line_6317'>  Prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_6318'>  The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:</a>
<a id='line_6319'></a>
<a id='line_6320'>  "What brings this Lycian counsellor so far,</a>
<a id='line_6321'>  To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!</a>
<a id='line_6322'>  Know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,</a>
<a id='line_6323'>  Who style thee son of cloud-compelling Jove.</a>
<a id='line_6324'>  How far unlike those chiefs of race divine,</a>
<a id='line_6325'>  How vast the difference of their deeds and thine!</a>
<a id='line_6326'>  Jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul</a>
<a id='line_6327'>  No fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.</a>
<a id='line_6328'>  Troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand</a>
<a id='line_6329'>  Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:</a>
<a id='line_6330'>  With six small ships, and but a slender train,</a>
<a id='line_6331'>  He left the town a wide-deserted plain.</a>
<a id='line_6332'>  But what art thou, who deedless look'st around,</a>
<a id='line_6333'>  While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!</a>
<a id='line_6334'>  Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;</a>
<a id='line_6335'>  But wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.</a>
<a id='line_6336'>  Pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!</a>
<a id='line_6337'>  I make this present to the shades below."</a>
<a id='line_6338'></a>
<a id='line_6339'>  The son of Hercules, the Rhodian guide,</a>
<a id='line_6340'>  Thus haughty spoke. The Lycian king replied:</a>
<a id='line_6341'></a>
<a id='line_6342'>  "Thy sire, O prince! o'erturn'd the Trojan state,</a>
<a id='line_6343'>  Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;</a>
<a id='line_6344'>  Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,</a>
<a id='line_6345'>  False he detain'd, the just reward of war.</a>
<a id='line_6346'>  Nor so content, the generous chief defied,</a>
<a id='line_6347'>  With base reproaches and unmanly pride.</a>
<a id='line_6348'>  But you, unworthy the high race you boast,</a>
<a id='line_6349'>  Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:</a>
<a id='line_6350'>  Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain,</a>
<a id='line_6351'>  Add one more ghost to Pluto's gloomy reign."</a>
<a id='line_6352'></a>
<a id='line_6353'>  He said: both javelins at an instant flew;</a>
<a id='line_6354'>  Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon's slew:</a>
<a id='line_6355'>  Full in the boaster's neck the weapon stood,</a>
<a id='line_6356'>  Transfix'd his throat, and drank the vital blood;</a>
<a id='line_6357'>  The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,</a>
<a id='line_6358'>  And his seal'd eyes for ever lose the light.</a>
<a id='line_6359'></a>
<a id='line_6360'>  Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown</a>
<a id='line_6361'>  Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone</a>
<a id='line_6362'>  Sarpedon's thigh, had robb'd the chief of breath;</a>
<a id='line_6363'>  But Jove was present, and forbade the death.</a>
<a id='line_6364'>  Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng,</a>
<a id='line_6365'>  The wounded hero dragg'd the lance along.</a>
<a id='line_6366'>  (His friends, each busied in his several part,</a>
<a id='line_6367'>  Through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.)</a>
<a id='line_6368'>  The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;</a>
<a id='line_6369'>  Whose fall Ulysses view'd, with fury fired;</a>
<a id='line_6370'>  Doubtful if Jove's great son he should pursue,</a>
<a id='line_6371'>  Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.</a>
<a id='line_6372'>  But heaven and fate the first design withstand,</a>
<a id='line_6373'>  Nor this great death must grace Ulysses' hand.</a>
<a id='line_6374'>  Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;</a>
<a id='line_6375'>  Alastor, Cronius, Halius, strew'd the plain,</a>
<a id='line_6376'>  Alcander, Prytanis, Noemon fell:(154)</a>
<a id='line_6377'>  And numbers more his sword had sent to hell,</a>
<a id='line_6378'>  But Hector saw; and, furious at the sight,</a>
<a id='line_6379'>  Rush'd terrible amidst the ranks of fight.</a>
<a id='line_6380'>  With joy Sarpedon view'd the wish'd relief,</a>
<a id='line_6381'>  And, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:</a>
<a id='line_6382'></a>
<a id='line_6383'>  "O suffer not the foe to bear away</a>
<a id='line_6384'>  My helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;</a>
<a id='line_6385'>  If I, unbless'd, must see my son no more,</a>
<a id='line_6386'>  My much-loved consort, and my native shore,</a>
<a id='line_6387'>  Yet let me die in Ilion's sacred wall;</a>
<a id='line_6388'>  Troy, in whose cause I fell, shall mourn my fall."</a>
<a id='line_6389'></a>
<a id='line_6390'>  He said, nor Hector to the chief replies,</a>
<a id='line_6391'>  But shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;</a>
<a id='line_6392'>  Swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;</a>
<a id='line_6393'>  And dyes the ground with purple as he goes.</a>
<a id='line_6394'></a>
<a id='line_6395'>  Beneath a beech, Jove's consecrated shade,</a>
<a id='line_6396'>  His mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid:</a>
<a id='line_6397'>  Brave Pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,</a>
<a id='line_6398'>  Who wrench'd the javelin from his sinewy thigh.</a>
<a id='line_6399'>  The fainting soul stood ready wing'd for flight,</a>
<a id='line_6400'>  And o'er his eye-balls swam the shades of night;</a>
<a id='line_6401'>  But Boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,</a>
<a id='line_6402'>  Recall'd his spirit from the gates of death.</a>
<a id='line_6403'></a>
<a id='line_6404'>  The generous Greeks recede with tardy pace,</a>
<a id='line_6405'>  Though Mars and Hector thunder in their face;</a>
<a id='line_6406'>  None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,</a>
<a id='line_6407'>  Slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.</a>
<a id='line_6408'>  Who first, who last, by Mars' and Hector's hand,</a>
<a id='line_6409'>  Stretch'd in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?</a>
<a id='line_6410'>  Tenthras the great, Orestes the renown'd</a>
<a id='line_6411'>  For managed steeds, and Trechus press'd the ground;,</a>
<a id='line_6412'>  Next OEnomaus and OEnops' offspring died;</a>
<a id='line_6413'>  Oresbius last fell groaning at their side:</a>
<a id='line_6414'>  Oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,</a>
<a id='line_6415'>  In fat Boeotia held his wealthy sway,</a>
<a id='line_6416'>  Where lakes surround low Hyle's watery plain;</a>
<a id='line_6417'>  A prince and people studious of their gain.</a>
<a id='line_6418'></a>
<a id='line_6419'>  The carnage Juno from the skies survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_6420'>  And touch'd with grief bespoke the blue-eyed maid:</a>
<a id='line_6421'>  "Oh, sight accursed! Shall faithless Troy prevail,</a>
<a id='line_6422'>  And shall our promise to our people fail?</a>
<a id='line_6423'>  How vain the word to Menelaus given</a>
<a id='line_6424'>  By Jove's great daughter and the queen of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_6425'>  Beneath his arms that Priam's towers should fall,</a>

<a id='line_6427'>  Mars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes:</a>
<a id='line_6428'>  Haste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!"</a>
<a id='line_6429'></a>
<a id='line_6430'>  She spoke; Minerva burns to meet the war:</a>
<a id='line_6431'>  And now heaven's empress calls her blazing car.</a>
<a id='line_6432'>  At her command rush forth the steeds divine;</a>
<a id='line_6433'>  Rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.</a>
<a id='line_6434'>  Bright Hebe waits; by Hebe, ever young,</a>
<a id='line_6435'>  The whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.</a>
<a id='line_6436'>  On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel</a>
<a id='line_6437'>  Of sounding brass; the polished axle steel.</a>
<a id='line_6438'>  Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;</a>
<a id='line_6439'>  The circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,</a>
<a id='line_6440'>  Such as the heavens produce: and round the gold</a>
<a id='line_6441'>  Two brazen rings of work divine were roll'd.</a>
<a id='line_6442'>  The bossy naves of sold silver shone;</a>
<a id='line_6443'>  Braces of gold suspend the moving throne:</a>
<a id='line_6444'>  The car, behind, an arching figure bore;</a>
<a id='line_6445'>  The bending concave form'd an arch before.</a>
<a id='line_6446'>  Silver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,</a>
<a id='line_6447'>  And golden reins the immortal coursers hold.</a>
<a id='line_6448'>  Herself, impatient, to the ready car,</a>
<a id='line_6449'>  The coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.</a>
<a id='line_6450'></a>
<a id='line_6451'>  Pallas disrobes; her radiant veil untied,</a>
<a id='line_6452'>  With flowers adorn'd, with art diversified,</a>
<a id='line_6453'>  (The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,)</a>
<a id='line_6454'>  Flows on the pavement of the court of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_6455'>  Now heaven's dread arms her mighty limbs invest,</a>
<a id='line_6456'>  Jove's cuirass blazes on her ample breast;</a>
<a id='line_6457'>  Deck'd in sad triumph for the mournful field,</a>
<a id='line_6458'>  O'er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,</a>
<a id='line_6459'>  Dire, black, tremendous! Round the margin roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_6460'>  A fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:</a>
<a id='line_6461'>  Here all the terrors of grim War appear,</a>
<a id='line_6462'>  Here rages Force, here tremble Flight and Fear,</a>
<a id='line_6463'>  Here storm'd Contention, and here Fury frown'd,</a>
<a id='line_6464'>  And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_6465'>  The massy golden helm she next assumes,</a>
<a id='line_6466'>  That dreadful nods with four o'ershading plumes;</a>
<a id='line_6467'>  So vast, the broad circumference contains</a>
<a id='line_6468'>  A hundred armies on a hundred plains.</a>
<a id='line_6469'>  The goddess thus the imperial car ascends;</a>
<a id='line_6470'>  Shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,</a>
<a id='line_6471'>  Ponderous and huge; that when her fury burns,</a>
<a id='line_6472'>  Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.</a>
<a id='line_6473'></a>
<a id='line_6474'>  Swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,</a>
<a id='line_6475'>  While the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.</a>
<a id='line_6476'>  Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,(155)</a>
<a id='line_6477'>  Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours;(156)</a>

<a id='line_6482'>  The sounding hinges ring on either side</a>
<a id='line_6483'>  The gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.</a>
<a id='line_6484'>  The chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,</a>
<a id='line_6485'>  Confused, Olympus' hundred heads arise;</a>

<a id='line_6487'>  O'er all the gods superior and alone.</a>
<a id='line_6488'>  There with her snowy hand the queen restrains</a>
<a id='line_6489'>  The fiery steeds, and thus to Jove complains:</a>
<a id='line_6490'></a>
<a id='line_6491'>  "O sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?</a>
<a id='line_6492'>  Can Mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?</a>
<a id='line_6493'>  What lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,</a>
<a id='line_6494'>  What rash destruction! and what heroes slain!</a>
<a id='line_6495'>  Venus, and Phoebus with the dreadful bow,</a>
<a id='line_6496'>  Smile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.</a>
<a id='line_6497'>  Mad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind</a>
<a id='line_6498'>  No god can govern, and no justice bind.</a>
<a id='line_6499'>  Say, mighty father! shall we scourge this pride,</a>
<a id='line_6500'>  And drive from fight the impetuous homicide?"</a>
<a id='line_6501'></a>
<a id='line_6502'>  To whom assenting, thus the Thunderer said:</a>
<a id='line_6503'>  "Go! and the great Minerva be thy aid.</a>

<a id='line_6505'>  And oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes."</a>
<a id='line_6506'></a>
<a id='line_6507'>  He said; Saturnia, ardent to obey,</a>

<a id='line_6509'>  Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,</a>
<a id='line_6510'>  Between the expanded earth and starry poles</a>
<a id='line_6511'>  Far as a shepherd, from some point on high,(157)</a>

<a id='line_6528'>  Heaven's empress mingles with the mortal crowd,</a>
<a id='line_6529'>  And shouts, in Stentor's sounding voice, aloud;</a>
<a id='line_6530'>  Stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,(158)</a>

<a id='line_6539'></a>
<a id='line_6540'>  Her speech new fury to their hearts convey'd;</a>

<a id='line_6556'>  And scarce refrain'd when I forbade the war.</a>
<a id='line_6557'>  Alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,</a>

<a id='line_6564'>  No drop of all thy father warms thy veins."</a>
<a id='line_6565'></a>
<a id='line_6566'>  The chief thus answered mild: "Immortal maid!</a>
<a id='line_6567'>  I own thy presence, and confess thy aid.</a>
<a id='line_6568'>  Not fear, thou know'st, withholds me from the plains,</a>
<a id='line_6569'>  Nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:</a>
<a id='line_6570'>  From warring gods thou bad'st me turn my spear,</a>
<a id='line_6571'>  And Venus only found resistance here.</a>
<a id='line_6572'>  Hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,</a>
<a id='line_6573'>  Loth I gave way, and warn'd our Argive bands:</a>
<a id='line_6574'>  For Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,</a>
<a id='line_6575'>  With slaughter red, and raging round the field."</a>
<a id='line_6576'></a>
<a id='line_6577'>  Then thus Minerva:--"Brave Tydides, hear!</a>

<a id='line_6583'>  Large promise makes, and breaks the promise made:</a>
<a id='line_6584'>  Now gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid."(159)</a>
<a id='line_6585'></a>

<a id='line_6592'>  She snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force,</a>

<a id='line_6619'>  When shouting millions shake the thundering field.</a>
<a id='line_6620'>  Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;</a>

<a id='line_6704'></a>
<a id='line_6705'>The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the chief</a>
<a id='line_6706'>augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint</a>
<a id='line_6707'>a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of</a>
<a id='line_6708'>Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The battle</a>
<a id='line_6709'>relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an</a>
<a id='line_6710'>interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of the</a>
<a id='line_6711'>friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they make</a>
<a id='line_6712'>exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus,</a>
<a id='line_6713'>prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a tender leave of</a>
<a id='line_6714'>his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.</a>
<a id='line_6715'></a>
<a id='line_6716'>The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and</a>
<a id='line_6717'>Scamander, and then changes to Troy.</a>
<a id='line_6718'></a>
<a id='line_6719'>  Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield</a>
<a id='line_6720'>  To human force and human skill the field:</a>
<a id='line_6721'>  Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;</a>

<a id='line_6723'>  While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain</a>

<a id='line_6726'>  Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,</a>

<a id='line_7119'>  The priestess then the shining veil displays,</a>

<a id='line_7352'>  There while you groan beneath the load of life,</a>
<a id='line_7353'>  They cry, 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'</a>
<a id='line_7354'>  Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,</a>
<a id='line_7355'>  Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.</a>
<a id='line_7356'>  The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,</a>
<a id='line_7357'>  A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!</a>
<a id='line_7358'>  May I lie cold before that dreadful day,</a>
<a id='line_7359'>  Press'd with a load of monumental clay!</a>
<a id='line_7360'>  Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,</a>
<a id='line_7361'>  Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep."</a>
<a id='line_7362'></a>
<a id='line_7363'>  Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy</a>
<a id='line_7364'>  Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.</a>
<a id='line_7365'>  The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,</a>
<a id='line_7366'>  Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.</a>
<a id='line_7367'>  With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,</a>
<a id='line_7368'>  And Hector hasted to relieve his child,</a>
<a id='line_7369'>  The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,</a>
<a id='line_7370'>  And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_7371'>  Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,</a>
<a id='line_7372'>  Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:</a>
<a id='line_7373'></a>
<a id='line_7374'>  "O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,</a>
<a id='line_7375'>  And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!</a>
<a id='line_7376'>  Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,</a>
<a id='line_7377'>  To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,</a>
<a id='line_7378'>  Against his country's foes the war to wage,</a>
<a id='line_7379'>  And rise the Hector of the future age!</a>
<a id='line_7380'>  So when triumphant from successful toils</a>
<a id='line_7381'>  Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,</a>
<a id='line_7382'>  Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,</a>
<a id='line_7383'>  And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame:'</a>
<a id='line_7384'>  While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_7385'>  His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy."</a>
<a id='line_7386'></a>
<a id='line_7387'>  He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,</a>
<a id='line_7388'>  Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;</a>
<a id='line_7389'>  Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,</a>
<a id='line_7390'>  Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.</a>
<a id='line_7391'>  The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,</a>
<a id='line_7392'>  She mingled with a smile a tender tear.</a>
<a id='line_7393'>  The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,</a>
<a id='line_7394'>  And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</a>
<a id='line_7395'></a>
<a id='line_7396'>  "Andromache! my soul's far better part,</a>
<a id='line_7397'>  Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?</a>
<a id='line_7398'>  No hostile hand can antedate my doom,</a>
<a id='line_7399'>  Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.</a>
<a id='line_7400'>  Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;</a>
<a id='line_7401'>  And such the hard condition of our birth:</a>
<a id='line_7402'>  No force can then resist, no flight can save,</a>
<a id='line_7403'>  All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.</a>
<a id='line_7404'>  No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,</a>
<a id='line_7405'>  There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:</a>
<a id='line_7406'>  Me glory summons to the martial scene,</a>
<a id='line_7407'>  The field of combat is the sphere for men.</a>
<a id='line_7408'>  Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,</a>
<a id='line_7409'>  The first in danger as the first in fame."</a>
<a id='line_7410'></a>
<a id='line_7411'>  Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes</a>
<a id='line_7412'>  His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.</a>
<a id='line_7413'>  His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,</a>
<a id='line_7414'>  Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye</a>
<a id='line_7415'>  That stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,</a>
<a id='line_7416'>  Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.</a>
<a id='line_7417'>  There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,</a>
<a id='line_7418'>  Through all her train the soft infection ran;</a>
<a id='line_7419'>  The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,</a>
<a id='line_7420'>  And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.</a>
<a id='line_7421'></a>
<a id='line_7422'>  But now, no longer deaf to honour's call,</a>
<a id='line_7423'>  Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.</a>
<a id='line_7424'>  In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,</a>
<a id='line_7425'>  Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.</a>
<a id='line_7426'>  The wanton courser thus with reins unbound(176)</a>
<a id='line_7427'>  Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;</a>
<a id='line_7428'>  Pamper'd and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,</a>
<a id='line_7429'>  And laves, in height of blood his shining sides;</a>
<a id='line_7430'>  His head now freed, he tosses to the skies;</a>
<a id='line_7431'>  His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies;</a>
<a id='line_7432'>  He snuffs the females in the distant plain,</a>
<a id='line_7433'>  And springs, exulting, to his fields again.</a>
<a id='line_7434'>  With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,</a>
<a id='line_7435'>  In arms refulgent as the god of day,</a>
<a id='line_7436'>  The son of Priam, glorying in his might,</a>
<a id='line_7437'>  Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.</a>
<a id='line_7438'></a>
<a id='line_7439'>  And now, the warriors passing on the way,</a>
<a id='line_7440'>  The graceful Paris first excused his stay.</a>
<a id='line_7441'>  To whom the noble Hector thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_7442'>  "O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!</a>
<a id='line_7443'>  Thy power in war with justice none contest;</a>
<a id='line_7444'>  Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd.</a>
<a id='line_7445'>  What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,</a>
<a id='line_7446'>  Or godlike Paris live a woman's slave!</a>
<a id='line_7447'>  My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,</a>
<a id='line_7448'>  And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.</a>
<a id='line_7449'>  Haste then, in all their glorious labours share,</a>
<a id='line_7450'>  For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.</a>
<a id='line_7451'>  These ills shall cease, whene'er by Jove's decree</a>
<a id='line_7452'>  We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:</a>
<a id='line_7453'>  While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,</a>
<a id='line_7454'>  And Greece indignant through her seas returns."</a>

<a id='line_7469'>BOOK VII.</a>
<a id='line_7470'></a>
<a id='line_7471'></a>
<a id='line_7472'>ARGUMENT</a>
<a id='line_7473'></a>
<a id='line_7474'>THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.</a>
<a id='line_7475'></a>
<a id='line_7476'>The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Minerva</a>
<a id='line_7477'>is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her descend from</a>
<a id='line_7478'>Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put off the general</a>
<a id='line_7479'>engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a</a>
<a id='line_7480'>single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is</a>
<a id='line_7481'>cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted</a>
<a id='line_7482'>by the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor purposes the delivery</a>
<a id='line_7483'>of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not consent, but offers to</a>
<a id='line_7484'>restore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to</a>
<a id='line_7485'>demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to</a>
<a id='line_7486'>by Agamemnon. When the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the</a>
<a id='line_7487'>advice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp,</a>
<a id='line_7488'>flanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune</a>
<a id='line_7489'>testifies his jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from</a>
<a id='line_7490'>Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens</a>
<a id='line_7491'>the Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.</a>
<a id='line_7492'></a>
<a id='line_7493'>The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the</a>
<a id='line_7494'>next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites of</a>
<a id='line_7495'>the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships. So</a>
<a id='line_7496'>that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The scene lies</a>
<a id='line_7497'>wholly in the field.</a>
<a id='line_7498'></a>
<a id='line_7499'>  So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,</a>
<a id='line_7500'>  Then rush'd impetuous through the Scaean gate.</a>
<a id='line_7501'>  Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;</a>
<a id='line_7502'>  Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.</a>
<a id='line_7503'>  As when to sailors labouring through the main,</a>
<a id='line_7504'>  That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,</a>
<a id='line_7505'>  Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;</a>
<a id='line_7506'>  The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.</a>
<a id='line_7507'>  So welcome these to Troy's desiring train,</a>
<a id='line_7508'>  The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.</a>
<a id='line_7509'></a>
<a id='line_7510'>  Bold Paris first the work of death begun</a>
<a id='line_7511'>  On great Menestheus, Areithous' son,</a>
<a id='line_7512'>  Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,</a>
<a id='line_7513'>  The pleasing Arne was his native place.</a>
<a id='line_7514'>  Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,</a>
<a id='line_7515'>  Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow(177)</a>
<a id='line_7516'>  Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;</a>
<a id='line_7517'>  And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.</a>
<a id='line_7518'>  By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphmous bleeds,</a>
<a id='line_7519'>  Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</a>
<a id='line_7520'>  Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,</a>
<a id='line_7521'>  Drop the cold useless members on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_7522'></a>
<a id='line_7523'>  When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,</a>
<a id='line_7524'>  From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain</a>
<a id='line_7525'>  Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,</a>
<a id='line_7526'>  Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height.</a>
<a id='line_7527'>  Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;</a>
<a id='line_7528'>  When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:</a>
<a id='line_7529'></a>
<a id='line_7530'>  "What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!</a>
<a id='line_7531'>  Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?</a>
<a id='line_7532'>  Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,</a>
<a id='line_7533'>  To give to Greece the long divided day?</a>
<a id='line_7534'>  Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,</a>
<a id='line_7535'>  Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;</a>
<a id='line_7536'>  This day, the business of the field suspend;</a>
<a id='line_7537'>  War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;</a>
<a id='line_7538'>  Since vengeful goddesses confederate join</a>
<a id='line_7539'>  To raze her walls, though built by hands divine."</a>
<a id='line_7540'></a>
<a id='line_7541'>  To whom the progeny of Jove replies:</a>
<a id='line_7542'>  "I left, for this, the council of the skies:</a>
<a id='line_7543'>  But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,</a>
<a id='line_7544'>  What art shall calm the furious sons of war?"</a>
<a id='line_7545'>  To her the god: "Great Hector's soul incite</a>
<a id='line_7546'>  To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,</a>
<a id='line_7547'>  Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show</a>
<a id='line_7548'>  A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe."</a>
<a id='line_7549'></a>
<a id='line_7550'>  At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;</a>
<a id='line_7551'>  Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;</a>
<a id='line_7552'>  Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address'd,</a>
<a id='line_7553'>  Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:</a>
<a id='line_7554'>  "O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear</a>
<a id='line_7555'>  Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!</a>
<a id='line_7556'>  Go forth persuasive, and a while engage</a>
<a id='line_7557'>  The warring nations to suspend their rage;</a>
<a id='line_7558'>  Then dare the boldest of the hostile train</a>
<a id='line_7559'>  To mortal combat on the listed plain.</a>
<a id='line_7560'>  For not this day shall end thy glorious date;</a>
<a id='line_7561'>  The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate."</a>
<a id='line_7562'></a>
<a id='line_7563'>  He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;</a>
<a id='line_7564'>  Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_7565'>  Held by the midst athwart. On either hand</a>
<a id='line_7566'>  The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;</a>
<a id='line_7567'>  Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:</a>
<a id='line_7568'>  They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.</a>
<a id='line_7569'>  The Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,(178)</a>
<a id='line_7570'>  With silent joy the settling hosts survey:</a>
<a id='line_7571'>  In form of vultures, on the beech's height</a>
<a id='line_7572'>  They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.</a>
<a id='line_7573'></a>
<a id='line_7574'>  The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,</a>
<a id='line_7575'>  Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.</a>
<a id='line_7576'>  As when a general darkness veils the main,</a>
<a id='line_7577'>  (Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)</a>
<a id='line_7578'>  The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,</a>
<a id='line_7579'>  And a still horror saddens all the deeps;</a>
<a id='line_7580'>  Thus in thick orders settling wide around,</a>
<a id='line_7581'>  At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.</a>
<a id='line_7582'>  Great Hector first amidst both armies broke</a>
<a id='line_7583'>  The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_7584'></a>
<a id='line_7585'>  "Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</a>
<a id='line_7586'>  What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.</a>
<a id='line_7587'>  Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,</a>
<a id='line_7588'>  O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;</a>
<a id='line_7589'>  War with a fiercer tide once more returns,</a>
<a id='line_7590'>  Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.</a>
<a id='line_7591'>  You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;</a>
<a id='line_7592'>  'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:</a>
<a id='line_7593'>  From all your troops select the boldest knight,</a>
<a id='line_7594'>  And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.</a>
<a id='line_7595'>  Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,</a>
<a id='line_7596'>  Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;</a>
<a id='line_7597'>  But let my body, to my friends return'd,</a>
<a id='line_7598'>  By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.</a>
<a id='line_7599'>  And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,</a>
<a id='line_7600'>  Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;</a>
<a id='line_7601'>  If mine the glory to despoil the foe;</a>
<a id='line_7602'>  On Phoebus' temple I'll his arms bestow:</a>
<a id='line_7603'>  The breathless carcase to your navy sent,</a>
<a id='line_7604'>  Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;</a>
<a id='line_7605'>  Which when some future mariner surveys,</a>
<a id='line_7606'>  Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,</a>
<a id='line_7607'>  Thus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,</a>
<a id='line_7608'>  By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'</a>
<a id='line_7609'>  The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name.</a>
<a id='line_7610'>  And distant ages learn the victor's fame."</a>
<a id='line_7611'></a>
<a id='line_7612'>  This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,</a>
<a id='line_7613'>  Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.</a>
<a id='line_7614'>  Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,</a>
<a id='line_7615'>  And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:</a>
<a id='line_7616'></a>
<a id='line_7617'>  "Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,</a>
<a id='line_7618'>  Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_7619'>  How great the shame, when every age shall know</a>
<a id='line_7620'>  That not a Grecian met this noble foe!</a>
<a id='line_7621'>  Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,</a>
<a id='line_7622'>  A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!</a>
<a id='line_7623'>  Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,</a>
<a id='line_7624'>  Myself will dare the danger of the day;</a>
<a id='line_7625'>  'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,</a>
<a id='line_7626'>  But in the hands of God is victory."</a>
<a id='line_7627'></a>
<a id='line_7628'>  These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</a>
<a id='line_7629'>  His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.</a>
<a id='line_7630'>  That day, Atrides! a superior hand</a>
<a id='line_7631'>  Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;</a>
<a id='line_7632'>  But all at once, thy fury to compose,</a>
<a id='line_7633'>  The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;</a>
<a id='line_7634'>  Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd</a>
<a id='line_7635'>  Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd:</a>
<a id='line_7636'>  "Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,</a>
<a id='line_7637'>  And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?</a>
<a id='line_7638'>  Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;</a>
<a id='line_7639'>  Great Hectors arm is mightier far than thine:</a>
<a id='line_7640'>  Even fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,</a>
<a id='line_7641'>  And trembling met this dreadful son of war.</a>
<a id='line_7642'>  Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;</a>
<a id='line_7643'>  Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.</a>
<a id='line_7644'>  The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,</a>
<a id='line_7645'>  Though bold and burning with desire of fame,</a>
<a id='line_7646'>  Content the doubtful honour might forego,</a>
<a id='line_7647'>  So great the danger, and so brave the foe."</a>
<a id='line_7648'></a>
<a id='line_7649'>  He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;</a>
<a id='line_7650'>  He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_7651'>  No longer bent to rush on certain harms;</a>
<a id='line_7652'>  His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.</a>
<a id='line_7653'></a>
<a id='line_7654'>  He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,</a>
<a id='line_7655'>  Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;</a>
<a id='line_7656'>  Thus to the kings he spoke: "What grief, what shame</a>
<a id='line_7657'>  Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!</a>
<a id='line_7658'>  How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn</a>
<a id='line_7659'>  Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!</a>
<a id='line_7660'>  What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_7661'>  O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!</a>
<a id='line_7662'>  Once with what joy the generous prince would hear</a>
<a id='line_7663'>  Of every chief who fought this glorious war,</a>
<a id='line_7664'>  Participate their fame, and pleased inquire</a>
<a id='line_7665'>  Each name, each action, and each hero's sire!</a>
<a id='line_7666'>  Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,</a>
<a id='line_7667'>  And trembling all before one hostile hand;</a>
<a id='line_7668'>  How would he lift his aged arms on high,</a>
<a id='line_7669'>  Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!</a>
<a id='line_7670'>  Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,</a>
<a id='line_7671'>  Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!</a>
<a id='line_7672'>  Years might again roll back, my youth renew,</a>
<a id='line_7673'>  And give this arm the spring which once it knew</a>
<a id='line_7674'>  When fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,</a>
<a id='line_7675'>  I led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,</a>
<a id='line_7676'>  And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,</a>
<a id='line_7677'>  Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.(179)</a>
<a id='line_7678'>  There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,</a>
<a id='line_7679'>  Proud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;</a>
<a id='line_7680'>  Great Areithous, known from shore to shore</a>
<a id='line_7681'>  By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;</a>
<a id='line_7682'>  No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,</a>
<a id='line_7683'>  But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.</a>
<a id='line_7684'>  Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,</a>
<a id='line_7685'>  Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,</a>
<a id='line_7686'>  Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,</a>
<a id='line_7687'>  Nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.</a>
<a id='line_7688'>  Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before</a>
<a id='line_7689'>  Had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:</a>
<a id='line_7690'>  But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,</a>
<a id='line_7691'>  To Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.</a>
<a id='line_7692'>  Furious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,</a>
<a id='line_7693'>  And dared the trial of the strongest hands;</a>
<a id='line_7694'>  Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:</a>
<a id='line_7695'>  All saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway</a>
<a id='line_7696'>  Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,</a>
<a id='line_7697'>  And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.</a>
<a id='line_7698'>  I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:</a>
<a id='line_7699'>  Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.</a>
<a id='line_7700'>  What then I was, O were your Nestor now!</a>
<a id='line_7701'>  Not Hector's self should want an equal foe.</a>
<a id='line_7702'>  But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,</a>
<a id='line_7703'>  The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,</a>
<a id='line_7704'>  Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,</a>
<a id='line_7705'>  Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?"</a>
<a id='line_7706'></a>
<a id='line_7707'>  His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;</a>
<a id='line_7708'>  And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,</a>
<a id='line_7709'>  Up-started fierce: but far before the rest</a>
<a id='line_7710'>  The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:</a>
<a id='line_7711'>  Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;</a>
<a id='line_7712'>  And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd;</a>
<a id='line_7713'>  Oileus follow'd; Idomen was there,(180)</a>
<a id='line_7714'>  And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:</a>
<a id='line_7715'>  With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,</a>
<a id='line_7716'>  And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.</a>
<a id='line_7717'>  All these, alike inspired with noble rage,</a>
<a id='line_7718'>  Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:</a>
<a id='line_7719'></a>
<a id='line_7720'>  "Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,</a>
<a id='line_7721'>  What chief shall combat, let the gods decide.</a>
<a id='line_7722'>  Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise</a>
<a id='line_7723'>  His country's fame, his own immortal praise."</a>
<a id='line_7724'></a>
<a id='line_7725'>  The lots produced, each hero signs his own:</a>
<a id='line_7726'>  Then in the general's helm the fates are thrown,(181)</a>
<a id='line_7727'>  The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,</a>
<a id='line_7728'>  And vows like these ascend from all the bands:</a>
<a id='line_7729'>  "Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,</a>
<a id='line_7730'>  A worthy champion for the Grecian state:</a>
<a id='line_7731'>  This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,</a>
<a id='line_7732'>  Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove."</a>
<a id='line_7733'>  Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,</a>
<a id='line_7734'>  Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.</a>
<a id='line_7735'>  This from the right to left the herald bears,</a>
<a id='line_7736'>  Held out in order to the Grecian peers;</a>
<a id='line_7737'>  Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,</a>
<a id='line_7738'>  Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;</a>
<a id='line_7739'>  Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,</a>
<a id='line_7740'>  Then casts before him, and with transport cries:</a>
<a id='line_7741'></a>
<a id='line_7742'>  "Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;</a>
<a id='line_7743'>  Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_7744'>  Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,</a>
<a id='line_7745'>  To Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:</a>
<a id='line_7746'>  But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,</a>
<a id='line_7747'>  And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.</a>
<a id='line_7748'>  Said I in secret? No, your vows declare</a>
<a id='line_7749'>  In such a voice as fills the earth and air,</a>
<a id='line_7750'>  Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?</a>
<a id='line_7751'>  Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!</a>
<a id='line_7752'>  From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,</a>
<a id='line_7753'>  And, born to combats, fear no force on earth."</a>
<a id='line_7754'></a>
<a id='line_7755'>  He said. The troops with elevated eyes,</a>
<a id='line_7756'>  Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:</a>
<a id='line_7757'>  "O father of mankind, superior lord!</a>
<a id='line_7758'>  On lofty Ida's holy hill adored:</a>
<a id='line_7759'>  Who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,</a>
<a id='line_7760'>  Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:</a>
<a id='line_7761'>  Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away</a>
<a id='line_7762'>  The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;</a>
<a id='line_7763'>  Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,</a>
<a id='line_7764'>  That both may claim it, and that both may share."</a>
<a id='line_7765'></a>
<a id='line_7766'>  Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;</a>
<a id='line_7767'>  Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:</a>
<a id='line_7768'>  He moves to combat with majestic pace;</a>
<a id='line_7769'>  So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,(182)</a>
<a id='line_7770'>  When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,</a>
<a id='line_7771'>  And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,</a>
<a id='line_7772'>  Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;</a>
<a id='line_7773'>  Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:(183)</a>
<a id='line_7774'>  His massy javelin quivering in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_7775'>  He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.</a>
<a id='line_7776'>  Through every Argive heart new transport ran;</a>
<a id='line_7777'>  All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:</a>
<a id='line_7778'>  Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_7779'>  Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:</a>
<a id='line_7780'>  'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;</a>
<a id='line_7781'>  Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.</a>
<a id='line_7782'></a>
<a id='line_7783'>  Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,</a>
<a id='line_7784'>  As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.</a>
<a id='line_7785'>  Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,</a>
<a id='line_7786'>  Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,</a>
<a id='line_7787'>  (The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell'd</a>
<a id='line_7788'>  And in all arts of armoury excell'd,)</a>
<a id='line_7789'>  This Ajax bore before his manly breast,</a>
<a id='line_7790'>  And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:</a>
<a id='line_7791'></a>
<a id='line_7792'>  "Hector! approach my arm, and singly know</a>
<a id='line_7793'>  What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.</a>
<a id='line_7794'>  Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,</a>
<a id='line_7795'>  Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:</a>
<a id='line_7796'>  Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,</a>
<a id='line_7797'>  Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;</a>
<a id='line_7798'>  Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,</a>
<a id='line_7799'>  And sends thee one, a sample of her host,</a>
<a id='line_7800'>  Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;</a>
<a id='line_7801'>  No more--be sudden, and begin the fight."</a>
<a id='line_7802'></a>
<a id='line_7803'>  "O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!</a>
<a id='line_7804'>  (To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)</a>
<a id='line_7805'>  Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,</a>
<a id='line_7806'>  New to the field, and trembling at the fight?</a>
<a id='line_7807'>  Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,</a>
<a id='line_7808'>  To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:</a>
<a id='line_7809'>  I know to shift my ground, remount the car,</a>
<a id='line_7810'>  Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;</a>
<a id='line_7811'>  To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,</a>
<a id='line_7812'>  And bear thick battle on my sounding shield</a>
<a id='line_7813'>  But open be our fight, and bold each blow;</a>
<a id='line_7814'>  I steal no conquest from a noble foe."</a>
<a id='line_7815'></a>
<a id='line_7816'>  He said, and rising, high above the field</a>
<a id='line_7817'>  Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.</a>
<a id='line_7818'>  Full on the brass descending from above</a>
<a id='line_7819'>  Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,</a>
<a id='line_7820'>  Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;</a>
<a id='line_7821'>  Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,</a>
<a id='line_7822'>  His corslet enters, and his garment rends,</a>
<a id='line_7823'>  And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.</a>
<a id='line_7824'>  The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low</a>
<a id='line_7825'>  Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.</a>
<a id='line_7826'>  From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,</a>
<a id='line_7827'>  Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;</a>
<a id='line_7828'>  Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,</a>
<a id='line_7829'>  Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.</a>
<a id='line_7830'>  At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;</a>
<a id='line_7831'>  The blunted point against the buckler bends;</a>
<a id='line_7832'>  But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,</a>
<a id='line_7833'>  Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;</a>
<a id='line_7834'>  It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!</a>
<a id='line_7835'>  Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.</a>
<a id='line_7836'>  Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,</a>
<a id='line_7837'>  In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,</a>
<a id='line_7838'>  Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;</a>
<a id='line_7839'>  Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;</a>
<a id='line_7840'>  The hollow brass resounded with the shock:</a>
<a id='line_7841'>  Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,</a>
<a id='line_7842'>  Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,</a>
<a id='line_7843'>  With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;</a>
<a id='line_7844'>  The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:</a>
<a id='line_7845'>  His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;</a>
<a id='line_7846'>  Great Hector falls extended on the field,</a>
<a id='line_7847'>  His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:</a>
<a id='line_7848'>  Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might</a>
<a id='line_7849'>  Confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.</a>
<a id='line_7850'>  And now both heroes their broad falchions drew</a>
<a id='line_7851'>  In flaming circles round their heads they flew;</a>
<a id='line_7852'>  But then by heralds' voice the word was given.</a>
<a id='line_7853'>  The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:</a>
<a id='line_7854'>  Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ.</a>
<a id='line_7855'>  And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_7856'>  Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;</a>
<a id='line_7857'>  And first Idaeus' awful voice was heard:</a>
<a id='line_7858'></a>
<a id='line_7859'>        [Illustration: HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS.]</a>
<a id='line_7860'></a>
<a id='line_7861'>                HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS.</a>
<a id='line_7862'></a>
<a id='line_7863'></a>
<a id='line_7864'>  "Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,</a>
<a id='line_7865'>  Both dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_7866'>  To either host your matchless worth is known,</a>
<a id='line_7867'>  Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.</a>
<a id='line_7868'>  But now the Night extends her awful shade;</a>
<a id='line_7869'>  The goddess parts you; be the night obey'd."(184)</a>
<a id='line_7870'></a>
<a id='line_7871'>  To whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:</a>
<a id='line_7872'>  "O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.</a>
<a id='line_7873'>  Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,</a>
<a id='line_7874'>  Let him demand the sanction of the night;</a>
<a id='line_7875'>  If first he ask'd it, I content obey,</a>
<a id='line_7876'>  And cease the strife when Hector shows the way."</a>
<a id='line_7877'></a>
<a id='line_7878'>  "O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)</a>
<a id='line_7879'>  Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,</a>
<a id='line_7880'>  With strength of body, and with worth of mind!</a>
<a id='line_7881'>  Now martial law commands us to forbear;</a>
<a id='line_7882'>  Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,</a>
<a id='line_7883'>  Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,</a>
<a id='line_7884'>  And let the gods decide of death or life!</a>
<a id='line_7885'>  Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,</a>
<a id='line_7886'>  And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.</a>
<a id='line_7887'>  Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,</a>
<a id='line_7888'>  And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;</a>
<a id='line_7889'>  As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,</a>
<a id='line_7890'>  Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.</a>
<a id='line_7891'>  But let us, on this memorable day,</a>
<a id='line_7892'>  Exchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,</a>
<a id='line_7893'>  'Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;</a>
<a id='line_7894'>  And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'"</a>
<a id='line_7895'></a>
<a id='line_7896'>  With that, a sword with stars of silver graced,</a>
<a id='line_7897'>  The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,</a>
<a id='line_7898'>  He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd</a>
<a id='line_7899'>  A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.</a>
<a id='line_7900'>  Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;</a>
<a id='line_7901'>  This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.</a>
<a id='line_7902'></a>
<a id='line_7903'>  The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,</a>
<a id='line_7904'>  And hail with joy the Champion of their state;</a>
<a id='line_7905'>  Escaped great Ajax, they survey him round,</a>
<a id='line_7906'>  Alive, unarm'd, and vigorous from his wound;</a>
<a id='line_7907'>  To Troy's high gates the godlike man they bear</a>
<a id='line_7908'>  Their present triumph, as their late despair.</a>
<a id='line_7909'></a>
<a id='line_7910'>  But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,</a>
<a id='line_7911'>  The well-arm'd Greeks to Agamemnon lead.</a>
<a id='line_7912'>  A steer for sacrifice the king design'd,</a>
<a id='line_7913'>  Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.</a>
<a id='line_7914'>  The victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,</a>
<a id='line_7915'>  The beast they quarter, and the joints divide;</a>
<a id='line_7916'>  Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,</a>
<a id='line_7917'>  Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.</a>
<a id='line_7918'>  The king himself (an honorary sign)</a>
<a id='line_7919'>  Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.(185)</a>
<a id='line_7920'>  When now the rage of hunger was removed,</a>
<a id='line_7921'>  Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,</a>
<a id='line_7922'>  The sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7923'>  In words like these his prudent thought express'd:</a>
<a id='line_7924'></a>
<a id='line_7925'>  "How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,</a>
<a id='line_7926'>  What Greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!</a>
<a id='line_7927'>  What tides of blood have drench'd Scamander's shore!</a>
<a id='line_7928'>  What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!</a>
<a id='line_7929'>  Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light</a>
<a id='line_7930'>  Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:</a>
<a id='line_7931'>  Some space at least permit the war to breathe,</a>
<a id='line_7932'>  While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,</a>
<a id='line_7933'>  From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,</a>
<a id='line_7934'>  And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;</a>
<a id='line_7935'>  So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,</a>
<a id='line_7936'>  And pious children o'er their ashes weep.</a>
<a id='line_7937'>  Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,</a>
<a id='line_7938'>  High o'er them all a general tomb be raised;</a>
<a id='line_7939'>  Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,</a>
<a id='line_7940'>  Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;</a>
<a id='line_7941'>  From space to space be ample gates around,</a>
<a id='line_7942'>  For passing chariots; and a trench profound.</a>
<a id='line_7943'>  So Greece to combat shall in safety go,</a>
<a id='line_7944'>  Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe."</a>
<a id='line_7945'>  'Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;</a>
<a id='line_7946'>  The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.</a>
<a id='line_7947'></a>
<a id='line_7948'>  Meanwhile, convened at Priam's palace-gate,</a>
<a id='line_7949'>  The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;</a>
<a id='line_7950'>  A senate void of order, as of choice:</a>
<a id='line_7951'>  Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.</a>
<a id='line_7952'>  Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:</a>
<a id='line_7953'>  "Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!</a>
<a id='line_7954'>  'Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,</a>
<a id='line_7955'>  And I but move what every god requires:</a>
<a id='line_7956'>  Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restored,</a>
<a id='line_7957'>  And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.</a>
<a id='line_7958'>  The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,</a>
<a id='line_7959'>  Our impious battles the just gods provoke.</a>
<a id='line_7960'>  As this advice ye practise, or reject,</a>
<a id='line_7961'>  So hope success, or dread the dire effect."</a>
<a id='line_7962'></a>
<a id='line_7963'>  The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied</a>
<a id='line_7964'>  The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:</a>
<a id='line_7965'>  "Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years</a>
<a id='line_7966'>  But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears:</a>
<a id='line_7967'>  Old man, if void of fallacy or art,</a>
<a id='line_7968'>  Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,</a>
<a id='line_7969'>  Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;</a>
<a id='line_7970'>  But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.</a>
<a id='line_7971'>  Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!</a>
<a id='line_7972'>  Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame;</a>
<a id='line_7973'>  My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;</a>
<a id='line_7974'>  But be this bright possession ever mine."</a>
<a id='line_7975'></a>
<a id='line_7976'>  'Twas then, the growing discord to compose,</a>
<a id='line_7977'>  Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:</a>
<a id='line_7978'>  His godlike aspect deep attention drew:</a>
<a id='line_7979'>  He paused, and these pacific words ensue:</a>

<a id='line_7981'>  "Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!</a>
<a id='line_7982'>  Now take refreshment as the hour demands;</a>
<a id='line_7983'>  Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.</a>
<a id='line_7984'>  Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.</a>
<a id='line_7985'>  Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,</a>
<a id='line_7986'>  Before their ships proclaim my son's intent.</a>
<a id='line_7987'>  Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn</a>
<a id='line_7988'>  Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn;</a>
<a id='line_7989'>  That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</a>
<a id='line_7990'>  And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"</a>
<a id='line_7991'></a>
<a id='line_7992'>  The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch'd with haste</a>
<a id='line_7993'>  (Each at his post in arms) a short repast.</a>
<a id='line_7994'>  Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,</a>
<a id='line_7995'>  To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;</a>
<a id='line_7996'>  There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,</a>
<a id='line_7997'>  He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.</a>
<a id='line_7998'></a>
<a id='line_7999'>  "Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!</a>
<a id='line_8000'>  The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear.</a>
<a id='line_8001'>  Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)</a>
<a id='line_8002'>  What Paris, author of the war, declares.</a>
<a id='line_8003'>  The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore</a>
<a id='line_8004'>  (Oh had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!)</a>
<a id='line_8005'>  He proffers injured Greece: with large increase</a>
<a id='line_8006'>  Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.</a>
<a id='line_8007'>  But to restore the beauteous bride again,</a>
<a id='line_8008'>  This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.</a>
<a id='line_8009'>  Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn</a>
<a id='line_8010'>  Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.</a>
<a id='line_8011'>  That done, once more the fate of war be tried,</a>
<a id='line_8012'>  And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"</a>
<a id='line_8013'></a>
<a id='line_8014'>  The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;</a>
<a id='line_8015'>  At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:</a>
<a id='line_8016'>  "Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,</a>
<a id='line_8017'>  Their proffer'd wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.</a>
<a id='line_8018'>  Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,</a>
<a id='line_8019'>  And Troy already totters to her fall."</a>
<a id='line_8020'></a>
<a id='line_8021'>  The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,</a>
<a id='line_8022'>  With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.</a>
<a id='line_8023'>  Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:</a>
<a id='line_8024'>  "Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece</a>
<a id='line_8025'>  For what remains; let funeral flames be fed</a>
<a id='line_8026'>  With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead:</a>
<a id='line_8027'>  Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,</a>
<a id='line_8028'>  And gratify the manes of the slain.</a>
<a id='line_8029'>  Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!"</a>
<a id='line_8030'>  He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.</a>
<a id='line_8031'></a>
<a id='line_8032'>  To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay</a>
<a id='line_8033'>  To wait the event, the herald bent his way.</a>
<a id='line_8034'>  He came, and standing in the midst, explain'd</a>
<a id='line_8035'>  The peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.</a>
<a id='line_8036'>  Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,</a>
<a id='line_8037'>  Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:</a>
<a id='line_8038'>  Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,</a>
<a id='line_8039'>  Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.</a>
<a id='line_8040'>  And now from forth the chambers of the main,</a>
<a id='line_8041'>  To shed his sacred light on earth again,</a>
<a id='line_8042'>  Arose the golden chariot of the day,</a>
<a id='line_8043'>  And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.</a>
<a id='line_8044'>  In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train</a>
<a id='line_8045'>  Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.</a>
<a id='line_8046'>  Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,</a>
<a id='line_8047'>  With dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore.</a>
<a id='line_8048'>  The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,</a>
<a id='line_8049'>  And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.</a>
<a id='line_8050'>  Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste</a>
<a id='line_8051'>  The bodies decent on the piles were placed:</a>
<a id='line_8052'>  With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,</a>
<a id='line_8053'>  And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return'd.</a>
<a id='line_8054'>  Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,</a>
<a id='line_8055'>  And decent on the pile dispose the dead;</a>
<a id='line_8056'>  The cold remains consume with equal care;</a>
<a id='line_8057'>  And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.</a>
<a id='line_8058'>  Now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light</a>
<a id='line_8059'>  The doubtful confines of the day and night,</a>
<a id='line_8060'>  About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,</a>
<a id='line_8061'>  And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.</a>
<a id='line_8062'>  Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,</a>
<a id='line_8063'>  They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:(186)</a>
<a id='line_8064'>  From space to space were ample gates around,</a>
<a id='line_8065'>  For passing chariots, and a trench profound</a>
<a id='line_8066'>  Of large extent; and deep in earth below,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>  Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.</a>
<a id='line_8068'></a>
<a id='line_8069'>  So toil'd the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,</a>
<a id='line_8070'>  In shining circle round their father Jove,</a>
<a id='line_8071'>  Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:</a>
<a id='line_8072'>  Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:</a>
<a id='line_8073'></a>
<a id='line_8074'>  "What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,</a>
<a id='line_8075'>  Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,</a>
<a id='line_8076'>  If the proud Grecians thus successful boast</a>
<a id='line_8077'>  Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?</a>
<a id='line_8078'>  See the long walls extending to the main,</a>
<a id='line_8079'>  No god consulted, and no victim slain!</a>
<a id='line_8080'>  Their fame shall fill the world's remotest ends,</a>
<a id='line_8081'>  Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;</a>
<a id='line_8082'>  While old Laomedon's divine abodes,</a>
<a id='line_8083'>  Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,</a>
<a id='line_8084'>  Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep."</a>
<a id='line_8085'>  Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.</a>
<a id='line_8086'></a>
<a id='line_8087'>  The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,</a>
<a id='line_8088'>  That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:</a>
<a id='line_8089'>  "Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make</a>
<a id='line_8090'>  The solid earth's eternal basis shake!</a>
<a id='line_8091'>  What cause of fear from mortal works could move(187)</a>
<a id='line_8092'>  The meanest subject of our realms above?</a>
<a id='line_8093'>  Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,</a>
<a id='line_8094'>  Thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last.</a>
<a id='line_8095'>  But yon proud work no future age shall view,</a>
<a id='line_8096'>  No trace remain where once the glory grew.</a>
<a id='line_8097'>  The sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall,</a>
<a id='line_8098'>  And, whelm'd beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:</a>
<a id='line_8099'>  Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:</a>
<a id='line_8100'>  The ruin vanish'd, and the name no more."</a>
<a id='line_8101'></a>
<a id='line_8102'>  Thus they in heaven: while, o'er the Grecian train,</a>
<a id='line_8103'>  The rolling sun descending to the main</a>
<a id='line_8104'>  Beheld the finish'd work. Their bulls they slew;</a>
<a id='line_8105'>  Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.</a>
<a id='line_8106'>  And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos' strands,</a>
<a id='line_8107'>  With Bacchus' blessings cheered the generous bands.</a>
<a id='line_8108'>  Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent</a>
<a id='line_8109'>  A thousant measures to the royal tent.</a>
<a id='line_8110'>  (Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore</a>
<a id='line_8111'>  To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore,)</a>
<a id='line_8112'>  The rest they purchased at their proper cost,</a>
<a id='line_8113'>  And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:</a>
<a id='line_8114'>  Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave;(188)</a>
<a id='line_8115'>  Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.</a>
<a id='line_8116'>  All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:</a>
<a id='line_8117'>  Those on the fields, and these within their towers.</a>
<a id='line_8118'>  But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd,</a>
<a id='line_8119'>  And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:</a>
<a id='line_8120'>  Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,</a>
<a id='line_8121'>  While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.</a>
<a id='line_8122'>  Each pour'd to Jove before the bowl was crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_8123'>  And large libations drench'd the thirsty ground:</a>
<a id='line_8124'>  Then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight,</a>
<a id='line_8125'>  Enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.</a>

<a id='line_8138'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_8139'></a>
<a id='line_8140'>THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.</a>
<a id='line_8141'></a>
<a id='line_8142'>Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the</a>
<a id='line_8143'>pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of him</a>
<a id='line_8144'>that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels.(189) his balances the</a>
<a id='line_8145'>fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings.</a>
<a id='line_8146'>Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him;</a>
<a id='line_8147'>whose exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno</a>
<a id='line_8148'>endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in</a>
<a id='line_8149'>vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried</a>
<a id='line_8150'>off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by</a>
<a id='line_8151'>Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the battle. Hector</a>
<a id='line_8152'>continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to their fortifications</a>
<a id='line_8153'>before the ships,) and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the</a>
<a id='line_8154'>camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and escaping by flight. They</a>
<a id='line_8155'>kindle fires through all the fields, and pass the night under arms.</a>
<a id='line_8156'></a>
<a id='line_8157'>The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem</a>
<a id='line_8158'>to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial machines)</a>
<a id='line_8159'>lies in the field towards the seashore.</a>
<a id='line_8160'></a>
<a id='line_8161'>  Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,</a>
<a id='line_8162'>  Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;</a>
<a id='line_8163'>  When Jove convened the senate of the skies,</a>
<a id='line_8164'>  Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise,</a>
<a id='line_8165'>  The sire of gods his awful silence broke;</a>
<a id='line_8166'>  The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_8167'></a>
<a id='line_8168'>  "Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,</a>
<a id='line_8169'>  Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;</a>
<a id='line_8170'>  The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;</a>
<a id='line_8171'>  Thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!</a>
<a id='line_8172'>  What god but enters yon forbidden field,</a>
<a id='line_8173'>  Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,</a>
<a id='line_8174'>  Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,</a>
<a id='line_8175'>  Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;</a>
<a id='line_8176'>  Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,</a>
<a id='line_8177'>  Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,</a>
<a id='line_8178'>  With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,</a>
<a id='line_8179'>  And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;</a>
<a id='line_8180'>  As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,(190)</a>
<a id='line_8181'>  As from that centre to the ethereal world.</a>
<a id='line_8182'>  Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:</a>
<a id='line_8183'>  And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.</a>
<a id='line_8184'>  League all your forces, then, ye powers above,</a>
<a id='line_8185'>  Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_8186'>  Let down our golden everlasting chain(191)</a>
<a id='line_8187'>  Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main</a>
<a id='line_8188'>  Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,</a>
<a id='line_8189'>  To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth</a>
<a id='line_8190'>  Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,</a>
<a id='line_8191'>  I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;</a>
<a id='line_8192'>  I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,</a>
<a id='line_8193'>  And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!</a>
<a id='line_8194'>  For such I reign, unbounded and above;</a>
<a id='line_8195'>  And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove."</a>
<a id='line_8196'></a>
<a id='line_8197'>  The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:</a>
<a id='line_8198'>  A reverend horror silenced all the sky;</a>
<a id='line_8199'>  Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look;</a>
<a id='line_8200'>  At length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:</a>
<a id='line_8201'></a>
<a id='line_8202'>  "O first and greatest! God, by gods adored</a>
<a id='line_8203'>  We own thy might, our father and our lord!</a>
<a id='line_8204'>  But, ah! permit to pity human state:</a>
<a id='line_8205'>  If not to help, at least lament their fate.</a>
<a id='line_8206'>  From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,</a>
<a id='line_8207'>  With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;</a>
<a id='line_8208'>  Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,</a>
<a id='line_8209'>  Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove."</a>
<a id='line_8210'></a>
<a id='line_8211'>  The cloud-compelling god her suit approved,</a>
<a id='line_8212'>  And smiled superior on his best beloved;</a>
<a id='line_8213'>  Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took;</a>
<a id='line_8214'>  The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:</a>
<a id='line_8215'>  Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_8216'>  Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:</a>
<a id='line_8217'>  Of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array,</a>
<a id='line_8218'>  Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.</a>
<a id='line_8219'>  High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly</a>
<a id='line_8220'>  Between the extended earth and starry sky.</a>
<a id='line_8221'>  But when to Ida's topmost height he came,</a>
<a id='line_8222'>  (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)</a>
<a id='line_8223'>  Where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,</a>
<a id='line_8224'>  His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:</a>
<a id='line_8225'>  There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire</a>
<a id='line_8226'>  Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:</a>
<a id='line_8227'>  Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;</a>
<a id='line_8228'>  High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;</a>
<a id='line_8229'>  Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,</a>
<a id='line_8230'>  The town, and tents, and navigable seas.</a>
<a id='line_8231'></a>
<a id='line_8232'>  Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast,</a>
<a id='line_8233'>  And buckled on their shining arms with haste.</a>
<a id='line_8234'>  Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day</a>
<a id='line_8235'>  The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.</a>
<a id='line_8236'>  The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;</a>
<a id='line_8237'>  Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:</a>
<a id='line_8238'>  Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,</a>
<a id='line_8239'>  The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;</a>
<a id='line_8240'>  And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,</a>
<a id='line_8241'>  To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,</a>
<a id='line_8242'>  Host against host with shadowy legends drew,</a>
<a id='line_8243'>  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;</a>
<a id='line_8244'>  Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,</a>
<a id='line_8245'>  Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;</a>
<a id='line_8246'>  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,</a>
<a id='line_8247'>  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.</a>
<a id='line_8248'>  Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,</a>
<a id='line_8249'>  O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,</a>
<a id='line_8250'>  Commutual death the fate of war confounds,</a>
<a id='line_8251'>  Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.</a>
<a id='line_8252'>  But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,</a>
<a id='line_8253'>  The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,(192)</a>
<a id='line_8254'>  With equal hand: in these explored the fate</a>
<a id='line_8255'>  Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:</a>
<a id='line_8256'>  Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies</a>
<a id='line_8257'>  Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.</a>
<a id='line_8258'>  Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;</a>
<a id='line_8259'>  The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;</a>
<a id='line_8260'>  Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;</a>
<a id='line_8261'>  Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.</a>
<a id='line_8262'>  Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;</a>
<a id='line_8263'>  The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.</a>
<a id='line_8264'>  Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,</a>
<a id='line_8265'>  Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:</a>
<a id='line_8266'>  Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd</a>
<a id='line_8267'>  Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.</a>
<a id='line_8268'>  Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart</a>
<a id='line_8269'>  Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;</a>
<a id='line_8270'>  Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing man</a>
<a id='line_8271'>  Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;</a>
<a id='line_8272'>  Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,</a>
<a id='line_8273'>  Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.</a>
<a id='line_8274'>  Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed</a>
<a id='line_8275'>  The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,</a>
<a id='line_8276'>  When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,</a>
<a id='line_8277'>  Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.</a>
<a id='line_8278'>  That day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand</a>
<a id='line_8279'>  The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,</a>
<a id='line_8280'>  But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd</a>
<a id='line_8281'>  He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud:</a>
<a id='line_8282'></a>
<a id='line_8283'>  "Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?</a>
<a id='line_8284'>  Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes' son!</a>
<a id='line_8285'>  Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,</a>
<a id='line_8286'>  Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?</a>
<a id='line_8287'>  Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage</a>
<a id='line_8288'>  The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage."</a>
<a id='line_8289'>  His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,</a>
<a id='line_8290'>  Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.</a>
<a id='line_8291'>  But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,</a>
<a id='line_8292'>  A single warrior midst a host of foes;</a>
<a id='line_8293'>  Before the coursers with a sudden spring</a>
<a id='line_8294'>  He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:</a>
<a id='line_8295'></a>
<a id='line_8296'>  "Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight;</a>
<a id='line_8297'>  These younger champions will oppress thy might.</a>
<a id='line_8298'>  Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,</a>
<a id='line_8299'>  Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.</a>
<a id='line_8300'>  Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car</a>
<a id='line_8301'>  Observe the steeds of Tros, renown'd in war.</a>
<a id='line_8302'>  Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,</a>
<a id='line_8303'>  To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:</a>
<a id='line_8304'>  These late obey'd AEneas' guiding rein;</a>
<a id='line_8305'>  Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;</a>
<a id='line_8306'>  With these against yon Trojans will we go,</a>
<a id='line_8307'>  Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;</a>
<a id='line_8308'>  Fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear</a>
<a id='line_8309'>  The thirsty fury of my flying spear."</a>
<a id='line_8310'></a>
<a id='line_8311'>  Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war,</a>
<a id='line_8312'>  Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:</a>
<a id='line_8313'>  The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;</a>
<a id='line_8314'>  Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:</a>
<a id='line_8315'>  The reverend charioteer directs the course,</a>
<a id='line_8316'>  And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.</a>
<a id='line_8317'>  Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,</a>
<a id='line_8318'>  Fierce he drove on; Tydides whirl'd his spear.</a>
<a id='line_8319'>  The spear with erring haste mistook its way,</a>
<a id='line_8320'>  But plunged in Eniopeus' bosom lay.</a>
<a id='line_8321'>  His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;</a>
<a id='line_8322'>  The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.</a>
<a id='line_8323'>  Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill'd,</a>
<a id='line_8324'>  Yet unrevenged permits to press the field;</a>
<a id='line_8325'>  Till, to supply his place and rule the car,</a>
<a id='line_8326'>  Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.</a>
<a id='line_8327'>  And now had death and horror cover'd all;(193)</a>
<a id='line_8328'>  Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall</a>
<a id='line_8329'>  Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound</a>
<a id='line_8330'>  Roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound:</a>
<a id='line_8331'>  Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew;</a>
<a id='line_8332'>  The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;</a>
<a id='line_8333'>  The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;</a>
<a id='line_8334'>  And Nestor's trembling hand confess'd his fright:</a>
<a id='line_8335'>  He dropp'd the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,</a>
<a id='line_8336'>  Thus, turning, warn'd the intrepid Diomed:</a>
<a id='line_8337'></a>
<a id='line_8338'>  "O chief! too daring in thy friend's defence</a>
<a id='line_8339'>  Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.</a>
<a id='line_8340'>  This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies</a>
<a id='line_8341'>  Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.</a>
<a id='line_8342'>  Some other sun may see the happier hour,</a>
<a id='line_8343'>  When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.</a>
<a id='line_8344'>  'Tis not in man his fix'd decree to move:</a>
<a id='line_8345'>  The great will glory to submit to Jove."</a>
<a id='line_8346'></a>
<a id='line_8347'>  "O reverend prince! (Tydides thus replies)</a>
<a id='line_8348'>  Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.</a>
<a id='line_8349'>  But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast</a>
<a id='line_8350'>  I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.</a>
<a id='line_8351'>  Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,</a>
<a id='line_8352'>  O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!"</a>
<a id='line_8353'>  To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:(194)</a>
<a id='line_8354'>  "Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride?</a>
<a id='line_8355'>  Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?</a>
<a id='line_8356'>  Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,</a>
<a id='line_8357'>  Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;</a>
<a id='line_8358'>  Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword</a>
<a id='line_8359'>  That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord."</a>
<a id='line_8360'>  He said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng</a>
<a id='line_8361'>  Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;</a>
<a id='line_8362'>  The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;</a>
<a id='line_8363'>  The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.</a>
<a id='line_8364'>  Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,</a>
<a id='line_8365'>  Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.</a>
<a id='line_8366'>  "Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest</a>
<a id='line_8367'>  In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:</a>
<a id='line_8368'>  Now hope no more those honours from thy train;</a>
<a id='line_8369'>  Go less than woman, in the form of man!</a>
<a id='line_8370'>  To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,</a>
<a id='line_8371'>  To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,</a>
<a id='line_8372'>  Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;</a>
<a id='line_8373'>  This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead."</a>
<a id='line_8374'></a>
<a id='line_8375'>  Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.</a>
<a id='line_8376'>  To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;</a>
<a id='line_8377'>  Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove</a>
<a id='line_8378'>  On Ida's summits thunder'd from above.</a>
<a id='line_8379'>  Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,</a>
<a id='line_8380'>  (The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:</a>
<a id='line_8381'></a>
<a id='line_8382'>  "Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,</a>
<a id='line_8383'>  All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.</a>
<a id='line_8384'>  Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,</a>
<a id='line_8385'>  Your great forefathers' glories, and your own.</a>
<a id='line_8386'>  Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame</a>
<a id='line_8387'>  Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.</a>
<a id='line_8388'>  In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,</a>
<a id='line_8389'>  Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.</a>
<a id='line_8390'>  High o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,</a>
<a id='line_8391'>  And pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.</a>
<a id='line_8392'>  Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,</a>
<a id='line_8393'>  Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;</a>
<a id='line_8394'>  Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,</a>
<a id='line_8395'>  All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires."</a>
<a id='line_8396'></a>
<a id='line_8397'>  Furious he said; then bending o'er the yoke,</a>
<a id='line_8398'>  Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_8399'></a>
<a id='line_8400'>  "Now, Xanthus, AEthon, Lampus, urge the chase,</a>
<a id='line_8401'>  And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;</a>
<a id='line_8402'>  Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,</a>
<a id='line_8403'>  And all your master's well-spent care repay.</a>
<a id='line_8404'>  For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,</a>
<a id='line_8405'>  Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;</a>
<a id='line_8406'>  For this my spouse, of great Aetion's line,</a>
<a id='line_8407'>  So oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.</a>
<a id='line_8408'>  Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd:</a>
<a id='line_8409'>  Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold;</a>
<a id='line_8410'>  From Tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,</a>
<a id='line_8411'>  Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:</a>
<a id='line_8412'>  These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!</a>
<a id='line_8413'>  This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!"</a>
<a id='line_8414'></a>
<a id='line_8415'>  That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia's soul;</a>
<a id='line_8416'>  She shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:</a>
<a id='line_8417'>  And thus to Neptune: "Thou, whose force can make</a>
<a id='line_8418'>  The stedfast earth from her foundations shake,</a>
<a id='line_8419'>  Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_8420'>  Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?</a>
<a id='line_8421'>  Yet AEgae, Helice, thy power obey,(195)</a>
<a id='line_8422'>  And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.</a>
<a id='line_8423'>  Would all the deities of Greece combine,</a>
<a id='line_8424'>  In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:</a>
<a id='line_8425'>  Sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,</a>
<a id='line_8426'>  And see his Trojans to the shades descend:</a>
<a id='line_8427'>  Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;</a>
<a id='line_8428'>  Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!"</a>
<a id='line_8429'></a>
<a id='line_8430'>  Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:</a>
<a id='line_8431'>  "What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?</a>
<a id='line_8432'>  I war not with the highest. All above</a>
<a id='line_8433'>  Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove."</a>
<a id='line_8434'></a>
<a id='line_8435'>  Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might</a>
<a id='line_8436'>  Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,</a>
<a id='line_8437'>  Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields</a>
<a id='line_8438'>  With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.</a>
<a id='line_8439'>  Where the deep trench in length extended lay,</a>
<a id='line_8440'>  Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,</a>
<a id='line_8441'>  A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat</a>
<a id='line_8442'>  With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.</a>
<a id='line_8443'>  The king of men, by Juno's self inspired,</a>
<a id='line_8444'>  Toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.</a>
<a id='line_8445'>  Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand</a>
<a id='line_8446'>  His purple robe, bright ensign of command.</a>
<a id='line_8447'>  High on the midmost bark the king appear'd:</a>
<a id='line_8448'>  There, from Ulysses' deck, his voice was heard:</a>
<a id='line_8449'>  To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound,</a>
<a id='line_8450'>  Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.</a>
<a id='line_8451'>  "O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:</a>
<a id='line_8452'>  The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)</a>
<a id='line_8453'>  Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,</a>
<a id='line_8454'>  Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?</a>
<a id='line_8455'>  Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,</a>
<a id='line_8456'>  While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;</a>
<a id='line_8457'>  But who to meet one martial man is found,</a>
<a id='line_8458'>  When the fight rages, and the flames surround?</a>
<a id='line_8459'>  O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress'd!</a>
<a id='line_8460'>  Was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?</a>
<a id='line_8461'>  With power immense, with justice arm'd in vain;</a>
<a id='line_8462'>  My glory ravish'd, and my people slain!</a>
<a id='line_8463'>  To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;</a>
<a id='line_8464'>  What altar smoked not with our victims' gore?</a>
<a id='line_8465'>  With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,</a>
<a id='line_8466'>  And ask'd destruction to the Trojan name.</a>
<a id='line_8467'>  Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;</a>
<a id='line_8468'>  Give these at least to 'scape from Hector's hand,</a>
<a id='line_8469'>  And save the relics of the Grecian land!"</a>
<a id='line_8470'></a>
<a id='line_8471'>  Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard</a>
<a id='line_8472'>  His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd:</a>
<a id='line_8473'>  The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,</a>
<a id='line_8474'>  And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.</a>
<a id='line_8475'>  His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,</a>
<a id='line_8476'>  A fawn his talons truss'd, (divine portent!)</a>
<a id='line_8477'>  High o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,</a>
<a id='line_8478'>  Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;</a>
<a id='line_8479'>  Then let the prey before his altar fall;</a>
<a id='line_8480'>  The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:</a>
<a id='line_8481'>  Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,</a>
<a id='line_8482'>  And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.</a>
<a id='line_8483'>  Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,</a>
<a id='line_8484'>  O'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,</a>
<a id='line_8485'>  Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,</a>
<a id='line_8486'>  And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.</a>
<a id='line_8487'>  Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)</a>
<a id='line_8488'>  With flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire;</a>
<a id='line_8489'>  Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_8490'>  The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:</a>
<a id='line_8491'>  Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;</a>
<a id='line_8492'>  His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8493'>  Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;</a>
<a id='line_8494'>  The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:</a>
<a id='line_8495'>  Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_8496'>  And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;</a>
<a id='line_8497'>  Evaemon's son next issues to the foe,</a>
<a id='line_8498'>  And last young Teucer with his bended bow.</a>
<a id='line_8499'>  Secure behind the Telamonian shield</a>
<a id='line_8500'>  The skilful archer wide survey'd the field,</a>
<a id='line_8501'>  With every shaft some hostile victim slew,</a>
<a id='line_8502'>  Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:</a>
<a id='line_8503'>  The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,</a>
<a id='line_8504'>  Retires for safety to the mother's arms.</a>
<a id='line_8505'>  Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,</a>
<a id='line_8506'>  Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.</a>
<a id='line_8507'>  Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled?</a>
<a id='line_8508'>  Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:</a>
<a id='line_8509'>  The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain,</a>
<a id='line_8510'>  With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:</a>
<a id='line_8511'>  Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;</a>
<a id='line_8512'>  The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_8513'>  Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,</a>
<a id='line_8514'>  A Trojan ghost attending every dart.</a>
<a id='line_8515'>  Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye</a>
<a id='line_8516'>  The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:</a>
<a id='line_8517'>  "O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)</a>
<a id='line_8518'>  Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;</a>
<a id='line_8519'>  Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,</a>
<a id='line_8520'>  Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!</a>
<a id='line_8521'>  Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,</a>
<a id='line_8522'>  The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:</a>
<a id='line_8523'>  Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,</a>
<a id='line_8524'>  And the brave son repays his cares with fame.</a>
<a id='line_8525'>  Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers</a>
<a id='line_8526'>  Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;</a>
<a id='line_8527'>  Whatever treasures Greece for me design,</a>
<a id='line_8528'>  The next rich honorary gift be thine:</a>
<a id='line_8529'>  Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,</a>
<a id='line_8530'>  With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:</a>
<a id='line_8531'>  Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,</a>
<a id='line_8532'>  Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love."</a>
<a id='line_8533'></a>
<a id='line_8534'>  To this the chief: "With praise the rest inspire,</a>
<a id='line_8535'>  Nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.</a>
<a id='line_8536'>  What strength I have, be now in battle tried,</a>
<a id='line_8537'>  Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.</a>
<a id='line_8538'>  Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,</a>
<a id='line_8539'>  Still aim'd at Hector have I bent my bow:</a>
<a id='line_8540'>  Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,</a>
<a id='line_8541'>  And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:</a>
<a id='line_8542'>  But sure some god denies me to destroy</a>
<a id='line_8543'>  This fury of the field, this dog of Troy."</a>
<a id='line_8544'></a>
<a id='line_8545'>  He said, and twang'd the string. The weapon flies</a>
<a id='line_8546'>  At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:</a>
<a id='line_8547'>  He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,</a>
<a id='line_8548'>  And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.</a>
<a id='line_8549'>  (Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,</a>
<a id='line_8550'>  This offspring added to king Priam's line.)</a>
<a id='line_8551'>  As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,(196)</a>
<a id='line_8552'>  Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;</a>
<a id='line_8553'>  So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd</a>
<a id='line_8554'>  Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.</a>
<a id='line_8555'>  Another shaft the raging archer drew,</a>
<a id='line_8556'>  That other shaft with erring fury flew,</a>
<a id='line_8557'>  (From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)</a>
<a id='line_8558'>  Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:</a>
<a id='line_8559'>  Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,</a>
<a id='line_8560'>  And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.</a>
<a id='line_8561'>  Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms</a>
<a id='line_8562'>  The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.</a>
<a id='line_8563'>  Hector with grief his charioteer beheld</a>
<a id='line_8564'>  All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:</a>
<a id='line_8565'>  Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,</a>
<a id='line_8566'>  Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_8567'>  Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,</a>
<a id='line_8568'>  And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.</a>
<a id='line_8569'>  The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;</a>
<a id='line_8570'>  The shaft already to his shoulder drew;</a>
<a id='line_8571'>  The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,</a>
<a id='line_8572'>  Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;</a>
<a id='line_8573'>  There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,</a>
<a id='line_8574'>  The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:</a>
<a id='line_8575'>  The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,</a>
<a id='line_8576'>  And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.</a>
<a id='line_8577'>  He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,</a>
<a id='line_8578'>  And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;</a>
<a id='line_8579'>  Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore</a>
<a id='line_8580'>  The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_8581'></a>
<a id='line_8582'>  Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,</a>
<a id='line_8583'>  He arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.</a>
<a id='line_8584'>  The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,</a>
<a id='line_8585'>  Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.</a>
<a id='line_8586'>  First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,</a>
<a id='line_8587'>  With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.</a>
<a id='line_8588'>  As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,</a>
<a id='line_8589'>  With beating bosom, and with eager pace,</a>
<a id='line_8590'>  Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,</a>
<a id='line_8591'>  Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;</a>
<a id='line_8592'>  Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;</a>
<a id='line_8593'>  Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.</a>
<a id='line_8594'>  When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,</a>
<a id='line_8595'>  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_8596'>  Before the ships a desperate stand they made,</a>
<a id='line_8597'>  And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.</a>
<a id='line_8598'>  Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:</a>

<a id='line_8637'>  Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved</a>

<a id='line_8639'>  Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;</a>
<a id='line_8640'>  Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.</a>
<a id='line_8641'>  Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?</a>

<a id='line_8934'>THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.</a>
<a id='line_8935'></a>
<a id='line_8936'>Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit the</a>
<a id='line_8937'>siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor</a>
<a id='line_8938'>seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to be</a>
<a id='line_8939'>strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be</a>
<a id='line_8940'>followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor</a>
<a id='line_8941'>further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to</a>
<a id='line_8942'>move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are</a>
<a id='line_8943'>accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very moving and</a>
<a id='line_8944'>pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who</a>
<a id='line_8945'>notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The ambassadors return</a>
<a id='line_8946'>unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.</a>
<a id='line_8947'></a>
<a id='line_8948'>This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which</a>
<a id='line_8949'>is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on</a>
<a id='line_8950'>the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.</a>
<a id='line_8951'></a>
<a id='line_8952'>  Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;</a>
<a id='line_8953'>  While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,(199)</a>
<a id='line_8954'>  And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,</a>
<a id='line_8955'>  Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.</a>
<a id='line_8956'>  As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,</a>
<a id='line_8957'>  A double tempest of the west and north</a>
<a id='line_8958'>  Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,</a>
<a id='line_8959'>  Heaps waves on waves, and bids the AEgean roar:</a>
<a id='line_8960'>  This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:</a>
<a id='line_8961'>  Such various passions urged the troubled host,</a>
<a id='line_8962'>  Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;</a>
<a id='line_8963'>  Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;</a>
<a id='line_8964'>  Himself his orders to the heralds bears,</a>
<a id='line_8965'>  To bid to council all the Grecian peers,</a>
<a id='line_8966'>  But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,</a>
<a id='line_8967'>  In solemn sadness and majestic grief.</a>
<a id='line_8968'>  The king amidst the mournful circle rose:</a>
<a id='line_8969'>  Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.</a>
<a id='line_8970'>  So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,</a>
<a id='line_8971'>  In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.</a>
<a id='line_8972'>  With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_8973'>  Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</a>
<a id='line_8974'></a>
<a id='line_8975'>  "Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;</a>
<a id='line_8976'>  Fellows in arms and princes of the war!</a>
<a id='line_8977'>  Of partial Jove too justly we complain,</a>
<a id='line_8978'>  And heavenly oracles believed in vain.</a>
<a id='line_8979'>  A safe return was promised to our toils,</a>
<a id='line_8980'>  With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:</a>
<a id='line_8981'>  Now shameful flight alone can save the host;</a>
<a id='line_8982'>  Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.</a>
<a id='line_8983'>  So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!</a>
<a id='line_8984'>  Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,</a>
<a id='line_8985'>  Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,</a>
<a id='line_8986'>  And towers and armies humbles to the dust.</a>
<a id='line_8987'>  Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,</a>
<a id='line_8988'>  Haste to the joys our native country yields;</a>
<a id='line_8989'>  Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,</a>
<a id='line_8990'>  Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy."</a>
<a id='line_8991'></a>
<a id='line_8992'>  He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;</a>
<a id='line_8993'>  Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;</a>
<a id='line_8994'>  A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son</a>
<a id='line_8995'>  Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:</a>
<a id='line_8996'>  "When kings advise us to renounce our fame,</a>
<a id='line_8997'>  First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.</a>
<a id='line_8998'>  If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,</a>
<a id='line_8999'>  The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.</a>
<a id='line_9000'>  Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,</a>
<a id='line_9001'>  Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:</a>
<a id='line_9002'>  Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,</a>
<a id='line_9003'>  The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.</a>
<a id='line_9004'>  The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,</a>
<a id='line_9005'>  The gods have made thee but by halves a king:</a>
<a id='line_9006'>  They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;</a>
<a id='line_9007'>  They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;</a>
<a id='line_9008'>  The noblest power that might the world control</a>
<a id='line_9009'>  They gave thee not--a brave and virtuous soul.</a>
<a id='line_9010'>  Is this a general's voice, that would suggest</a>
<a id='line_9011'>  Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?</a>
<a id='line_9012'>  Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;</a>
<a id='line_9013'>  And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.</a>
<a id='line_9014'>  Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;</a>
<a id='line_9015'>  Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;</a>
<a id='line_9016'>  A noble care the Grecians shall employ,</a>
<a id='line_9017'>  To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.</a>
<a id='line_9018'>  Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,</a>
<a id='line_9019'>  Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;</a>
<a id='line_9020'>  Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;</a>
<a id='line_9021'>  God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came."</a>
<a id='line_9022'></a>
<a id='line_9023'>  He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,</a>
<a id='line_9024'>  And voice to voice resounds Tydides' praise.</a>
<a id='line_9025'>  Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear'd;</a>
<a id='line_9026'>  He spoke: the host in still attention heard:(200)</a>
<a id='line_9027'></a>
<a id='line_9028'>  "O truly great! in whom the gods have join'd</a>
<a id='line_9029'>  Such strength of body with such force of mind:</a>
<a id='line_9030'>  In conduct, as in courage, you excel,</a>
<a id='line_9031'>  Still first to act what you advise so well.</a>
<a id='line_9032'>  These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,</a>
<a id='line_9033'>  Applauding Greece with common voice approves.</a>
<a id='line_9034'>  Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:</a>
<a id='line_9035'>  And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.</a>
<a id='line_9036'>  And yet those years that since thy birth have run</a>
<a id='line_9037'>  Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.</a>
<a id='line_9038'>  Then let me add what yet remains behind,</a>
<a id='line_9039'>  A thought unfinish'd in that generous mind;</a>
<a id='line_9040'>  Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring</a>
<a id='line_9041'>  Distaste the people, or offend the king:</a>
<a id='line_9042'></a>
<a id='line_9043'>  "Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,</a>
<a id='line_9044'>  Unworthy property, unworthy light,</a>
<a id='line_9045'>  Unfit for public rule, or private care,</a>
<a id='line_9046'>  That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;</a>
<a id='line_9047'>  Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,</a>
<a id='line_9048'>  To tear his country, and his kind destroy!</a>
<a id='line_9049'>  This night, refresh and fortify thy train;</a>
<a id='line_9050'>  Between the trench and wall let guards remain:</a>
<a id='line_9051'>  Be that the duty of the young and bold;</a>
<a id='line_9052'>  But thou, O king, to council call the old;</a>
<a id='line_9053'>  Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;</a>
<a id='line_9054'>  Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.</a>
<a id='line_9055'>  With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,</a>
<a id='line_9056'>  For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.</a>
<a id='line_9057'>  Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,</a>
<a id='line_9058'>  And such a monarch as can choose the best.</a>
<a id='line_9059'>  See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,</a>
<a id='line_9060'>  How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!</a>
<a id='line_9061'>  Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?</a>
<a id='line_9062'>  What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?</a>
<a id='line_9063'>  This dreadful interval determines all;</a>
<a id='line_9064'>  To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall."</a>
<a id='line_9065'></a>
<a id='line_9066'>  Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;</a>
<a id='line_9067'>  Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.</a>
<a id='line_9068'>  His son was first to pass the lofty mound,</a>
<a id='line_9069'>  The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown'd:</a>
<a id='line_9070'>  Next him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,</a>
<a id='line_9071'>  The double offspring of the warrior-god:</a>
<a id='line_9072'>  Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,</a>
<a id='line_9073'>  And Lycomed of Creon's noble line.</a>
<a id='line_9074'>  Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,</a>
<a id='line_9075'>  And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.</a>
<a id='line_9076'>  The fires they light, to short repasts they fall,</a>
<a id='line_9077'>  Some line the trench, and others man the wall.</a>
<a id='line_9078'></a>
<a id='line_9079'>  The king of men, on public counsels bent,</a>
<a id='line_9080'>  Convened the princes in his ample tent,</a>
<a id='line_9081'>  Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,</a>
<a id='line_9082'>  But stay'd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.</a>
<a id='line_9083'>  Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,</a>
<a id='line_9084'>  And slowly rising, thus the council moved.</a>
<a id='line_9085'></a>
<a id='line_9086'>  "Monarch of nations! whose superior sway</a>
<a id='line_9087'>  Assembled states, and lords of earth obey,</a>

<a id='line_9089'>  And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_9090'>  O king! the counsels of my age attend;</a>
<a id='line_9091'>  With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.</a>
<a id='line_9092'>  Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,</a>
<a id='line_9093'>  Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,</a>
<a id='line_9094'>  To see no wholesome motion be withstood,</a>
<a id='line_9095'>  And ratify the best for public good.</a>
<a id='line_9096'>  Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,</a>
<a id='line_9097'>  But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.</a>
<a id='line_9098'>  Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,</a>
<a id='line_9099'>  At once my present judgment and my past.</a>
<a id='line_9100'>  When from Pelides' tent you forced the maid,</a>

<a id='line_9103'>  You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:</a>
<a id='line_9104'>  Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,</a>
<a id='line_9105'>  With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend."</a>

<a id='line_9113'>  Fain would my heart, which err'd through frantic rage,</a>

<a id='line_9116'>  Hear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.</a>
<a id='line_9117'>  Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,</a>

<a id='line_9119'>  Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame</a>
<a id='line_9120'>  Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;</a>
<a id='line_9121'>  Twelve steeds unmatch'd in fleetness and in force,</a>

<a id='line_9131'>  With all her charms, Briseis I resign,</a>
<a id='line_9132'>  And solemn swear those charms were never mine;</a>
<a id='line_9133'>  Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,</a>
<a id='line_9134'>  Pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,(202)</a>
<a id='line_9135'>  These instant shall be his; and if the powers</a>
<a id='line_9136'>  Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,</a>
<a id='line_9137'>  Then shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)</a>
<a id='line_9138'>  With gold and brass his loaded navy's sides:</a>
<a id='line_9139'>  Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race</a>
<a id='line_9140'>  With copious love shall crown his warm embrace,</a>

<a id='line_9227'>  Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds</a>
<a id='line_9228'>  To his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.</a>
<a id='line_9229'>  Achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,</a>
<a id='line_9230'>  Leap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.</a>
<a id='line_9231'>  With like surprise arose Menoetius' son:</a>
<a id='line_9232'>  Pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:</a>
<a id='line_9233'></a>
<a id='line_9234'>  "Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.</a>
<a id='line_9235'>  Or strong necessity, or urgent fear;</a>
<a id='line_9236'>  Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;</a>
<a id='line_9237'>  To me more dear than all that bear the name."</a>
<a id='line_9238'></a>
<a id='line_9239'>  With that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,</a>
<a id='line_9240'>  And placed in seats with purple carpets spread.</a>
<a id='line_9241'>  Then thus--"Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,</a>
<a id='line_9242'>  Mix purer wine, and open every soul.</a>
<a id='line_9243'>  Of all the warriors yonder host can send,</a>
<a id='line_9244'>  Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend."</a>
<a id='line_9245'></a>
<a id='line_9246'>  He said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire</a>
<a id='line_9247'>  Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:</a>
<a id='line_9248'>  The brazen vase Automedon sustains,</a>
<a id='line_9249'>  Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.</a>
<a id='line_9250'>  Achilles at the genial feast presides,</a>
<a id='line_9251'>  The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.</a>
<a id='line_9252'>  Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;</a>
<a id='line_9253'>  The tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze:</a>
<a id='line_9254'>  Then, when the languid flames at length subside,</a>
<a id='line_9255'>  He strows a bed of glowing embers wide,</a>
<a id='line_9256'>  Above the coals the smoking fragments turns</a>
<a id='line_9257'>  And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;</a>
<a id='line_9258'>  With bread the glittering canisters they load,</a>
<a id='line_9259'>  Which round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd;</a>
<a id='line_9260'>  Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,</a>
<a id='line_9261'>  Each portion parts, and orders every rite.</a>
<a id='line_9262'>  The first fat offering to the immortals due,</a>
<a id='line_9263'>  Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;</a>
<a id='line_9264'>  Then each, indulging in the social feast,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>  His thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.</a>
<a id='line_9266'>  That done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign:</a>
<a id='line_9267'>  Not unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine</a>
<a id='line_9268'>  The foaming bowl, and instant thus began,</a>
<a id='line_9269'>  His speech addressing to the godlike man.</a>
<a id='line_9270'></a>
<a id='line_9271'>  "Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!</a>
<a id='line_9272'>  Not those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts:</a>
<a id='line_9273'>  Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,</a>
<a id='line_9274'>  That, Agamemnon's regal tent affords;</a>
<a id='line_9275'>  But greater cares sit heavy on our souls,</a>
<a id='line_9276'>  Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.</a>
<a id='line_9277'>  What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!</a>
<a id='line_9278'>  The dead we mourn, and for the living fear;</a>
<a id='line_9279'>  Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,</a>
<a id='line_9280'>  And owns no help but from thy saving hands:</a>
<a id='line_9281'>  Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call;</a>
<a id='line_9282'>  Their threatening tents already shade our wall:</a>
<a id='line_9283'>  Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_9284'>  And point at every ship their vengeful flame!</a>
<a id='line_9285'>  For them the father of the gods declares,</a>
<a id='line_9286'>  Theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.</a>
<a id='line_9287'>  See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!</a>
<a id='line_9288'>  See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;</a>
<a id='line_9289'>  What fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!</a>
<a id='line_9290'>  He waits but for the morn, to sink in flame</a>
<a id='line_9291'>  The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.</a>
<a id='line_9292'>  Heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,</a>
<a id='line_9293'>  Lest Fate accomplish all his rage design'd!</a>
<a id='line_9294'>  And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay</a>
<a id='line_9295'>  In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?</a>
<a id='line_9296'>  Return, Achilles: oh return, though late,</a>
<a id='line_9297'>  To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;</a>
<a id='line_9298'>  If in that heart or grief or courage lies,</a>
<a id='line_9299'>  Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!</a>
<a id='line_9300'>  The day may come, when, all our warriors slain,</a>
<a id='line_9301'>  That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:</a>
<a id='line_9302'>  Regard in time, O prince divinely brave!</a>
<a id='line_9303'>  Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.</a>
<a id='line_9304'>  When Peleus in his aged arms embraced</a>
<a id='line_9305'>  His parting son, these accents were his last:</a>
<a id='line_9306'></a>
<a id='line_9307'>  "'My child! with strength, with glory, and success,</a>
<a id='line_9308'>  Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!</a>
<a id='line_9309'>  Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage</a>
<a id='line_9310'>  To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:</a>
<a id='line_9311'>  From gentler manners let thy glory grow,</a>
<a id='line_9312'>  And shun contention, the sure source of woe;</a>
<a id='line_9313'>  That young and old may in thy praise combine,</a>
<a id='line_9314'>  The virtues of humanity be thine--'</a>
<a id='line_9315'>  This now-despised advice thy father gave;</a>
<a id='line_9316'>  Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.</a>
<a id='line_9317'>  If thou wilt yield to great Atrides' prayers,</a>
<a id='line_9318'>  Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;</a>
<a id='line_9319'>  If not--but hear me, while I number o'er</a>
<a id='line_9320'>  The proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store.</a>
<a id='line_9321'>  Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,</a>
<a id='line_9322'>  And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;</a>
<a id='line_9323'>  Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame</a>
<a id='line_9324'>  Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;</a>
<a id='line_9325'>  Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,</a>
<a id='line_9326'>  And still victorious in the dusty course;</a>
<a id='line_9327'>  (Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed</a>
<a id='line_9328'>  The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)</a>
<a id='line_9329'>  Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,</a>
<a id='line_9330'>  Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>  The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,</a>
<a id='line_9332'>  When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.</a>
<a id='line_9333'>  All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,</a>
<a id='line_9334'>  And, join'd with these, the long-contested maid;</a>
<a id='line_9335'>  With all her charms, Briseis he'll resign,</a>
<a id='line_9336'>  And solemn swear those charms were only thine;</a>
<a id='line_9337'>  Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,</a>
<a id='line_9338'>  Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.</a>
<a id='line_9339'>  These instant shall be thine; and if the powers</a>
<a id='line_9340'>  Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,</a>
<a id='line_9341'>  Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)</a>
<a id='line_9342'>  With gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.</a>
<a id='line_9343'>  Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race</a>
<a id='line_9344'>  With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;</a>
<a id='line_9345'>  Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,</a>
<a id='line_9346'>  Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.</a>
<a id='line_9347'>  Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9348'>  If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,</a>
<a id='line_9349'>  There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,</a>
<a id='line_9350'>  And with Orestes' self divide his care.</a>
<a id='line_9351'>  Yet more--three daughters in his court are bred,</a>
<a id='line_9352'>  And each well worthy of a royal bed:</a>
<a id='line_9353'>  Laodice and Iphigenia fair,</a>
<a id='line_9354'>  And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:</a>
<a id='line_9355'>  Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;</a>
<a id='line_9356'>  He asks no presents, no reward for love:</a>
<a id='line_9357'>  Himself will give the dower; so vast a store</a>
<a id='line_9358'>  As never father gave a child before.</a>
<a id='line_9359'>  Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,</a>
<a id='line_9360'>  The Enope and Pherae thee obey,</a>
<a id='line_9361'>  Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_9362'>  And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:</a>
<a id='line_9363'>  AEpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,</a>
<a id='line_9364'>  And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;</a>
<a id='line_9365'>  The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,</a>
<a id='line_9366'>  Along the verdant margin of the main.</a>
<a id='line_9367'>  There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;</a>
<a id='line_9368'>  Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.</a>
<a id='line_9369'>  There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_9370'>  And rule the tributary realms around.</a>
<a id='line_9371'>  Such are the proffers which this day we bring,</a>
<a id='line_9372'>  Such the repentance of a suppliant king.</a>
<a id='line_9373'>  But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,</a>
<a id='line_9374'>  If honour and if interest plead in vain,</a>
<a id='line_9375'>  Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,</a>
<a id='line_9376'>  And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.</a>
<a id='line_9377'>  If no regard thy suffering country claim,</a>
<a id='line_9378'>  Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:</a>
<a id='line_9379'>  For now that chief, whose unresisted ire</a>
<a id='line_9380'>  Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,</a>
<a id='line_9381'>  Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,</a>
<a id='line_9382'>  And only triumphs to deserve thy hands."</a>
<a id='line_9383'></a>
<a id='line_9384'>  Then thus the goddess-born: "Ulysses, hear</a>
<a id='line_9385'>  A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;</a>
<a id='line_9386'>  What in my secret soul is understood,</a>
<a id='line_9387'>  My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.</a>
<a id='line_9388'>  Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:</a>
<a id='line_9389'>  Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.</a>
<a id='line_9390'>  Who dares think one thing, and another tell,</a>
<a id='line_9391'>  My heart detests him as the gates of hell.</a>
<a id='line_9392'></a>
<a id='line_9393'>  "Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,</a>
<a id='line_9394'>  Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;</a>
<a id='line_9395'>  Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,</a>
<a id='line_9396'>  But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.</a>
<a id='line_9397'>  Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,</a>
<a id='line_9398'>  The wretch and hero find their prize the same.</a>
<a id='line_9399'>  Alike regretted in the dust he lies,</a>
<a id='line_9400'>  Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.</a>
<a id='line_9401'>  Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,</a>
<a id='line_9402'>  A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?</a>
<a id='line_9403'>  As the bold bird her helpless young attends,</a>
<a id='line_9404'>  From danger guards them, and from want defends;</a>
<a id='line_9405'>  In search of prey she wings the spacious air,</a>
<a id='line_9406'>  And with the untasted food supplies her care:</a>
<a id='line_9407'>  For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,</a>
<a id='line_9408'>  Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;</a>
<a id='line_9409'>  Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,</a>
<a id='line_9410'>  And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.</a>
<a id='line_9411'>  I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,(207)</a>
<a id='line_9412'>  And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:</a>
<a id='line_9413'>  Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid</a>
<a id='line_9414'>  The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.</a>
<a id='line_9415'>  Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;</a>
<a id='line_9416'>  Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.</a>
<a id='line_9417'>  Some present, too, to every prince was paid;</a>
<a id='line_9418'>  And every prince enjoys the gift he made:</a>
<a id='line_9419'>  I only must refund, of all his train;</a>
<a id='line_9420'>  See what pre-eminence our merits gain!</a>
<a id='line_9421'>  My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:</a>
<a id='line_9422'>  My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:</a>
<a id='line_9423'>  The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;</a>
<a id='line_9424'>  But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?</a>
<a id='line_9425'>  What to these shores the assembled nations draws,</a>
<a id='line_9426'>  What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?</a>
<a id='line_9427'>  Are fair endowments and a beauteous face</a>
<a id='line_9428'>  Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race?</a>
<a id='line_9429'>  The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,</a>
<a id='line_9430'>  Sure every wise and worthy man will love.</a>
<a id='line_9431'>  Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;</a>
<a id='line_9432'>  Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.</a>
<a id='line_9433'>  Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;</a>
<a id='line_9434'>  Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.</a>
<a id='line_9435'>  Ye have my answer--what remains to do,</a>
<a id='line_9436'>  Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.</a>
<a id='line_9437'>  What needs he the defence this arm can make?</a>
<a id='line_9438'>  Has he not walls no human force can shake?</a>
<a id='line_9439'>  Has he not fenced his guarded navy round</a>
<a id='line_9440'>  With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?</a>
<a id='line_9441'>  And will not these (the wonders he has done)</a>
<a id='line_9442'>  Repel the rage of Priam's single son?</a>
<a id='line_9443'>  There was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)</a>
<a id='line_9444'>  When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;</a>
<a id='line_9445'>  He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait</a>
<a id='line_9446'>  Achilles' fury at the Scaean gate;</a>
<a id='line_9447'>  He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.</a>
<a id='line_9448'>  But now those ancient enmities are o'er;</a>
<a id='line_9449'>  To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;</a>
<a id='line_9450'>  Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_9451'>  And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.</a>
<a id='line_9452'>  The third day hence shall Pthia greet our sails,(208)</a>

<a id='line_9473'>  His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind</a>
<a id='line_9474'>  Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,</a>
<a id='line_9475'>  Not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_9476'>  And all his rapine could from others wrest:</a>
<a id='line_9477'>  Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown</a>
<a id='line_9478'>  The many-peopled Orchomenian town;(209)</a>
<a id='line_9479'>  Not all proud Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,</a>

<a id='line_9557'>  The royal Peleus, when from Pthia's coast</a>

<a id='line_9563'>  Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!</a>
<a id='line_9564'>  No time shall part us, and no fate divide,</a>

<a id='line_9566'>  The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,</a>
<a id='line_9567'>  When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames</a>

<a id='line_9569'>  My father faithless to my mother's arms,</a>
<a id='line_9570'>  Old as he was, adored a stranger's charms.</a>
<a id='line_9571'>  I tried what youth could do (at her desire)</a>

<a id='line_9607'>  Thy growing virtues justified my cares,</a>
<a id='line_9608'>  And promised comfort to my silver hairs.</a>
<a id='line_9609'>  Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd;</a>

<a id='line_9611'>  The gods (the only great, and only wise)</a>
<a id='line_9612'>  Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;</a>
<a id='line_9613'>  Offending man their high compassion wins,</a>
<a id='line_9614'>  And daily prayers atone for daily sins.</a>
<a id='line_9615'>  Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race,</a>
<a id='line_9616'>  Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;</a>
<a id='line_9617'>  With humble mien, and with dejected eyes,</a>
<a id='line_9618'>  Constant they follow, where injustice flies.</a>
<a id='line_9619'>  Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,</a>
<a id='line_9620'>  Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,</a>
<a id='line_9621'>  While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.</a>
<a id='line_9622'>  Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove,</a>
<a id='line_9623'>  For him they mediate to the throne above</a>
<a id='line_9624'>  When man rejects the humble suit they make,</a>
<a id='line_9625'>  The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;</a>
<a id='line_9626'>  From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then</a>
<a id='line_9627'>  Descends to punish unrelenting men.</a>
<a id='line_9628'>  O let not headlong passion bear the sway</a>

<a id='line_9637'>  And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;</a>
<a id='line_9638'>  The best and noblest of the Grecian train;</a>
<a id='line_9639'>  Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!</a>
<a id='line_9640'>  Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,</a>
<a id='line_9641'>  A great example drawn from times of old;</a>
<a id='line_9642'>  Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,</a>
<a id='line_9643'>  Who conquer'd their revenge in former days.</a>
<a id='line_9644'></a>
<a id='line_9645'>  "Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands(212)</a>
<a id='line_9646'>  Once fought the AEtolian and Curetian bands;</a>
<a id='line_9647'>  To guard it those; to conquer, these advance;</a>
<a id='line_9648'>  And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.</a>
<a id='line_9649'>  The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,</a>
<a id='line_9650'>  In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;</a>
<a id='line_9651'>  On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,</a>
<a id='line_9652'>  That levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:</a>
<a id='line_9653'>  This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)</a>
<a id='line_9654'>  Great Meleager stretch'd along the plain,</a>
<a id='line_9655'>  Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,</a>
<a id='line_9656'>  The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.</a>
<a id='line_9657'>  Strong as they were, the bold Curetes fail'd,</a>
<a id='line_9658'>  While Meleager's thundering arm prevail'd:</a>
<a id='line_9659'>  Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast</a>
<a id='line_9660'>  (For rage invades the wisest and the best).</a>
<a id='line_9661'></a>
<a id='line_9662'>  "Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,</a>
<a id='line_9663'>  And in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.</a>
<a id='line_9664'>  (She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,</a>
<a id='line_9665'>  And matchless Idas, more than man in war:</a>
<a id='line_9666'>  The god of day adored the mother's charms;</a>
<a id='line_9667'>  Against the god the father bent his arms:</a>
<a id='line_9668'>  The afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_9669'>  From Cleopatra changed their daughter's name,</a>
<a id='line_9670'>  And call'd Alcyone; a name to show</a>
<a id='line_9671'>  The father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.)</a>
<a id='line_9672'>  To her the chief retired from stern debate,</a>
<a id='line_9673'>  But found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:</a>
<a id='line_9674'>  Althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,</a>
<a id='line_9675'>  Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;</a>
<a id='line_9676'>  She beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath</a>
<a id='line_9677'>  On her own son to wreak her brother's death;</a>
<a id='line_9678'>  Hell heard her curses from the realms profound,</a>
<a id='line_9679'>  And the red fiends that walk the nightly round.</a>
<a id='line_9680'>  In vain AEtolia her deliverer waits,</a>
<a id='line_9681'>  War shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.</a>
<a id='line_9682'>  She sent ambassadors, a chosen band,</a>
<a id='line_9683'>  Priests of the gods, and elders of the land;</a>
<a id='line_9684'>  Besought the chief to save the sinking state:</a>
<a id='line_9685'>  Their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:</a>
<a id='line_9686'>  (Full fifty acres of the richest ground,</a>
<a id='line_9687'>  Half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:)</a>
<a id='line_9688'>  His suppliant father, aged OEneus, came;</a>
<a id='line_9689'>  His sisters follow'd; even the vengeful dame,</a>
<a id='line_9690'>  Althaea, sues; his friends before him fall:</a>
<a id='line_9691'>  He stands relentless, and rejects them all.</a>
<a id='line_9692'>  Meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;</a>
<a id='line_9693'>  The walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;</a>
<a id='line_9694'>  At length his wife (a form divine) appears,</a>
<a id='line_9695'>  With piercing cries, and supplicating tears;</a>
<a id='line_9696'>  She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,</a>
<a id='line_9697'>  The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_9698'>  The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:</a>
<a id='line_9699'>  The warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.</a>
<a id='line_9700'>  The AEtolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,</a>
<a id='line_9701'>  And left the chief their broken faith to mourn.</a>
<a id='line_9702'>  Learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,</a>
<a id='line_9703'>  Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;</a>
<a id='line_9704'>  Accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;</a>
<a id='line_9705'>  And be amongst our guardian gods adored."</a>
<a id='line_9706'></a>
<a id='line_9707'>  Thus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_9708'>  "My second father, and my reverend guide:</a>

<a id='line_9712'>  His pleasure guides me, and his will confines;</a>

<a id='line_9714'>  While life's warm spirit beats within my breast.</a>
<a id='line_9715'>  Yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:</a>
<a id='line_9716'>  No more molest me on Atrides' part:</a>

<a id='line_9718'>  For him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?</a>
<a id='line_9719'>  A generous friendship no cold medium knows,</a>
<a id='line_9720'>  Burns with one love, with one resentment glows;</a>
<a id='line_9721'>  One should our interests and our passions be;</a>
<a id='line_9722'>  My friend must hate the man that injures me.</a>
<a id='line_9723'>  Do this, my Phoenix, 'tis a generous part;</a>
<a id='line_9724'>  And share my realms, my honours, and my heart.</a>
<a id='line_9725'>  Let these return: our voyage, or our stay,</a>
<a id='line_9726'>  Rest undetermined till the dawning day."</a>
<a id='line_9727'></a>
<a id='line_9728'>  He ceased; then order'd for the sage's bed</a>
<a id='line_9729'>  A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.</a>
<a id='line_9730'>  With that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,</a>
<a id='line_9731'>  And thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:</a>
<a id='line_9732'></a>
<a id='line_9733'>  "Hence let us go--why waste we time in vain?</a>
<a id='line_9734'>  See what effect our low submissions gain!</a>

<a id='line_9740'>  On just atonement, we remit the deed;</a>
<a id='line_9741'>  A sire the slaughter of his son forgives;</a>
<a id='line_9742'>  The price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:</a>
<a id='line_9743'>  The haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,</a>
<a id='line_9744'>  And gifts can conquer every soul but thine.(213)</a>
<a id='line_9745'>  The gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,</a>
<a id='line_9746'>  And cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.</a>
<a id='line_9747'>  One woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms:</a>
<a id='line_9748'>  Lo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.</a>
<a id='line_9749'>  Then hear, Achilles! be of better mind;</a>
<a id='line_9750'>  Revere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;</a>
<a id='line_9751'>  And know the men of all the Grecian host,</a>
<a id='line_9752'>  Who honour worth, and prize thy valour most."</a>
<a id='line_9753'></a>
<a id='line_9754'>  "O soul of battles, and thy people's guide!</a>
<a id='line_9755'>  (To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)</a>
<a id='line_9756'>  Well hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant's name</a>
<a id='line_9757'>  My rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame:</a>
<a id='line_9758'>  'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:</a>
<a id='line_9759'>  Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!</a>
<a id='line_9760'>  Return, then, heroes! and our answer bear,</a>

<a id='line_9768'></a>
<a id='line_9769'>  This said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,</a>

<a id='line_9771'>  Then to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,</a>
<a id='line_9772'>  The chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.</a>
<a id='line_9773'>  Meantime Achilles' slaves prepared a bed,</a>
<a id='line_9774'>  With fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:</a>
<a id='line_9775'>  There, till the sacred morn restored the day,</a>
<a id='line_9776'>  In slumber sweet the reverend Phoenix lay.</a>
<a id='line_9777'>  But in his inner tent, an ampler space,</a>
<a id='line_9778'>  Achilles slept; and in his warm embrace</a>
<a id='line_9779'>  Fair Diomede of the Lesbian race.</a>
<a id='line_9780'>  Last, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,</a>
<a id='line_9781'>  Whose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;</a>

<a id='line_9784'></a>
<a id='line_9785'>  And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,</a>
<a id='line_9786'>  Pass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.</a>
<a id='line_9787'>  Then rising all, with goblets in their hands,</a>
<a id='line_9788'>  The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands</a>

<a id='line_9798'>  And, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.</a>
<a id='line_9799'>  To save our army, and our fleets to free,</a>
<a id='line_9800'>  Is not his care; but left to Greece and thee.</a>
<a id='line_9801'>  Your eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,</a>
<a id='line_9802'>  Beneath his oars the whitening billows fly;</a>
<a id='line_9803'>  Us too he bids our oars and sails employ,</a>
<a id='line_9804'>  Nor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;</a>
<a id='line_9805'>  For Jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,</a>
<a id='line_9806'>  Inspires her war, and bids her glory shine.</a>
<a id='line_9807'>  Such was his word: what further he declared,</a>
<a id='line_9808'>  These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.</a>
<a id='line_9809'>  But Phoenix in his tent the chief retains,</a>
<a id='line_9810'>  Safe to transport him to his native plains</a>
<a id='line_9811'>  When morning dawns; if other he decree,</a>
<a id='line_9812'>  His age is sacred, and his choice is free."</a>
<a id='line_9813'></a>
<a id='line_9814'>  Ulysses ceased: the great Achaian host,</a>
<a id='line_9815'>  With sorrow seized, in consternation lost,</a>
<a id='line_9816'>  Attend the stern reply. Tydides broke</a>
<a id='line_9817'>  The general silence, and undaunted spoke.</a>
<a id='line_9818'>  "Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send,</a>
<a id='line_9819'>  Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?</a>
<a id='line_9820'>  His country's woes he glories to deride,</a>
<a id='line_9821'>  And prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.</a>
<a id='line_9822'>  Be the fierce impulse of his rage obey'd,</a>
<a id='line_9823'>  Our battles let him or desert or aid;</a>
<a id='line_9824'>  Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit:</a>

<a id='line_9855'>THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.</a>
<a id='line_9856'></a>
<a id='line_9857'>Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of</a>
<a id='line_9858'>Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that</a>
<a id='line_9859'>night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving</a>
<a id='line_9860'>all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and</a>
<a id='line_9861'>Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a</a>
<a id='line_9862'>council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp, to</a>
<a id='line_9863'>learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed undertakes this</a>
<a id='line_9864'>hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion. In</a>
<a id='line_9865'>their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design</a>
<a id='line_9866'>to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are informed of the situation</a>
<a id='line_9867'>of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the</a>
<a id='line_9868'>Thracians who were lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus,</a>
<a id='line_9869'>with several of his officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince,</a>
<a id='line_9870'>with which they return in triumph to the camp.</a>
<a id='line_9871'></a>
<a id='line_9872'>The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.</a>
<a id='line_9873'></a>
<a id='line_9874'>  All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,</a>
<a id='line_9875'>  And lost in sleep the labours of the day:</a>
<a id='line_9876'>  All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,(215)</a>
<a id='line_9877'>  His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.</a>
<a id='line_9878'>  As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power</a>
<a id='line_9879'>  Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,</a>
<a id='line_9880'>  Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,</a>
<a id='line_9881'>  Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;</a>
<a id='line_9882'>  By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,</a>
<a id='line_9883'>  And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:</a>
<a id='line_9884'>  So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,</a>
<a id='line_9885'>  Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.</a>
<a id='line_9886'>  Now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys</a>
<a id='line_9887'>  From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;</a>
<a id='line_9888'>  Hears in the passing wind their music blow,</a>
<a id='line_9889'>  And marks distinct the voices of the foe.</a>
<a id='line_9890'>  Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,</a>
<a id='line_9891'>  Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.</a>
<a id='line_9892'>  He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,</a>
<a id='line_9893'>  And sues to him that ever lives above:</a>
<a id='line_9894'>  Inly he groans; while glory and despair</a>
<a id='line_9895'>  Divide his heart, and wage a double war.</a>
<a id='line_9896'></a>
<a id='line_9897'>  A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;</a>
<a id='line_9898'>  To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,</a>
<a id='line_9899'>  With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate</a>
<a id='line_9900'>  What yet remains to save the afflicted state.</a>
<a id='line_9901'>  He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,</a>
<a id='line_9902'>  Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;</a>
<a id='line_9903'>  A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;</a>
<a id='line_9904'>  His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.</a>
<a id='line_9905'>  Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,</a>
<a id='line_9906'>  Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,</a>
<a id='line_9907'>  Laments for Greece, that in his cause before</a>
<a id='line_9908'>  So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.</a>
<a id='line_9909'>  A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread:</a>
<a id='line_9910'>  A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:</a>
<a id='line_9911'>  Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went</a>
<a id='line_9912'>  To wake Atrides in the royal tent.</a>
<a id='line_9913'>  Already waked, Atrides he descried,</a>
<a id='line_9914'>  His armour buckling at his vessel's side.</a>
<a id='line_9915'>  Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:</a>
<a id='line_9916'>  "Why puts my brother his bright armour on?</a>
<a id='line_9917'>  Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,</a>
<a id='line_9918'>  To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?</a>
<a id='line_9919'>  But say, what hero shall sustain that task?</a>
<a id='line_9920'>  Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;</a>
<a id='line_9921'>  Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,</a>
<a id='line_9922'>  And midst a hostile camp explore the foe."</a>
<a id='line_9923'></a>
<a id='line_9924'>  To whom the king: "In such distress we stand,</a>
<a id='line_9925'>  No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;</a>
<a id='line_9926'>  Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,</a>
<a id='line_9927'>  But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.</a>
<a id='line_9928'>  For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,</a>
<a id='line_9929'>  And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_9930'>  What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,</a>
<a id='line_9931'>  In one great day, by one great arm achieved,</a>
<a id='line_9932'>  Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,</a>
<a id='line_9933'>  And we beheld, the last revolving sun</a>
<a id='line_9934'>  What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!</a>
<a id='line_9935'>  Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;</a>
<a id='line_9936'>  Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,</a>
<a id='line_9937'>  And curse the battle where their fathers fell.</a>
<a id='line_9938'></a>
<a id='line_9939'>  "Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,</a>
<a id='line_9940'>  There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;</a>
<a id='line_9941'>  Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;</a>
<a id='line_9942'>  To keep the guards on duty be his care,</a>
<a id='line_9943'>  (For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,</a>
<a id='line_9944'>  Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.")</a>
<a id='line_9945'>  To whom the Spartan: "These thy orders borne,</a>
<a id='line_9946'>  Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?"</a>
<a id='line_9947'>  "There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)</a>
<a id='line_9948'>  Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,</a>
<a id='line_9949'>  The paths so many, and the camp so wide.</a>
<a id='line_9950'>  Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,</a>
<a id='line_9951'>  Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.</a>
<a id='line_9952'>  Forget we now our state and lofty birth;</a>
<a id='line_9953'>  Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.</a>
<a id='line_9954'>  To labour is the lot of man below;</a>
<a id='line_9955'>  And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe."</a>
<a id='line_9956'></a>
<a id='line_9957'>  This said, each parted to his several cares:</a>
<a id='line_9958'>  The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;</a>
<a id='line_9959'>  The sage protector of the Greeks he found</a>
<a id='line_9960'>  Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around</a>
<a id='line_9961'>  The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,</a>
<a id='line_9962'>  The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;</a>
<a id='line_9963'>  The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,</a>
<a id='line_9964'>  That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.</a>
<a id='line_9965'>  Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,</a>
<a id='line_9966'>  The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:</a>
<a id='line_9967'></a>
<a id='line_9968'>  "What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,</a>
<a id='line_9969'>  While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;</a>
<a id='line_9970'>  Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?</a>
<a id='line_9971'>  Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell."</a>
<a id='line_9972'></a>
<a id='line_9973'>  "O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)</a>
<a id='line_9974'>  Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!</a>
<a id='line_9975'>  Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,</a>
<a id='line_9976'>  The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,</a>
<a id='line_9977'>  Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,</a>
<a id='line_9978'>  And woes, that only with his life shall end!</a>
<a id='line_9979'>  Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,</a>
<a id='line_9980'>  And scarce my heart support its load of pain.</a>
<a id='line_9981'>  No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,</a>
<a id='line_9982'>  Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,</a>
<a id='line_9983'>  With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;</a>
<a id='line_9984'>  And all my people's miseries are mine.</a>
<a id='line_9985'>  If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,</a>
<a id='line_9986'>  (Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)</a>
<a id='line_9987'>  Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;</a>
<a id='line_9988'>  Now let us jointly to the trench descend,</a>
<a id='line_9989'>  At every gate the fainting guard excite,</a>
<a id='line_9990'>  Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;</a>
<a id='line_9991'>  Else may the sudden foe our works invade,</a>
<a id='line_9992'>  So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade."</a>
<a id='line_9993'></a>
<a id='line_9994'>  To him thus Nestor: "Trust the powers above,</a>
<a id='line_9995'>  Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:</a>
<a id='line_9996'>  How ill agree the views of vain mankind,</a>
<a id='line_9997'>  And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!</a>
<a id='line_9998'>  Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain</a>
<a id='line_9999'>  That great Achilles rise and rage again,</a>
<a id='line_10000'>  What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!</a>
<a id='line_10001'>  Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;</a>
<a id='line_10002'>  The care is next our other chiefs to raise:</a>
<a id='line_10003'>  Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;</a>
<a id='line_10004'>  Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.</a>
<a id='line_10005'>  Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,</a>
<a id='line_10006'>  To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,</a>
<a id='line_10007'>  Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.(216)</a>
<a id='line_10008'>  To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;</a>
<a id='line_10009'>  Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,</a>
<a id='line_10010'>  Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share</a>
<a id='line_10011'>  With his great brother in his martial care:</a>
<a id='line_10012'>  Him it behoved to every chief to sue,</a>
<a id='line_10013'>  Preventing every part perform'd by you;</a>
<a id='line_10014'>  For strong necessity our toils demands,</a>
<a id='line_10015'>  Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands."</a>
<a id='line_10016'></a>
<a id='line_10017'>  To whom the king: "With reverence we allow</a>
<a id='line_10018'>  Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:</a>
<a id='line_10019'>  My generous brother is of gentle kind,</a>
<a id='line_10020'>  He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;</a>
<a id='line_10021'>  Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,</a>
<a id='line_10022'>  Content to follow when we lead the way:</a>
<a id='line_10023'>  But now, our ills industrious to prevent,</a>
<a id='line_10024'>  Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.</a>
<a id='line_10025'>  The chiefs you named, already at his call,</a>
<a id='line_10026'>  Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;</a>
<a id='line_10027'>  Assembling there, between the trench and gates,</a>
<a id='line_10028'>  Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits."</a>
<a id='line_10029'></a>
<a id='line_10030'>  "Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,</a>
<a id='line_10031'>  For great examples justify command."</a>
<a id='line_10032'>  With that, the venerable warrior rose;</a>
<a id='line_10033'>  The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;</a>
<a id='line_10034'>  His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,</a>
<a id='line_10035'>  Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.</a>
<a id='line_10036'>  Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste</a>
<a id='line_10037'>  His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.</a>
<a id='line_10038'>  The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,</a>
<a id='line_10039'>  Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.</a>
<a id='line_10040'>  Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,</a>
<a id='line_10041'>  Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.</a>
<a id='line_10042'>  "What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,</a>
<a id='line_10043'>  Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?"</a>
<a id='line_10044'>  "O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)</a>
<a id='line_10045'>  Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:</a>
<a id='line_10046'>  Whatever means of safety can be sought,</a>
<a id='line_10047'>  Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,</a>
<a id='line_10048'>  Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;</a>
<a id='line_10049'>  All, all depend on this important night!"</a>
<a id='line_10050'>  He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;</a>
<a id='line_10051'>  Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.</a>
<a id='line_10052'>  Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,</a>
<a id='line_10053'>  All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:</a>
<a id='line_10054'>  Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,</a>
<a id='line_10055'>  His head reclining on his bossy shield.</a>
<a id='line_10056'>  A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,</a>
<a id='line_10057'>  Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.</a>
<a id='line_10058'>  A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;</a>
<a id='line_10059'>  A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.</a>
<a id='line_10060'>  Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes</a>
<a id='line_10061'>  The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:</a>
<a id='line_10062'></a>
<a id='line_10063'>  "Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong</a>
<a id='line_10064'>  Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.</a>
<a id='line_10065'>  But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe</a>
<a id='line_10066'>  Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?"</a>
<a id='line_10067'></a>
<a id='line_10068'>  At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;</a>
<a id='line_10069'>  The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:</a>
<a id='line_10070'>  "Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,</a>
<a id='line_10071'>  Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,</a>
<a id='line_10072'>  Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;</a>
<a id='line_10073'>  Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake."</a>
<a id='line_10074'>  "My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;</a>
<a id='line_10075'>  These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;</a>
<a id='line_10076'>  Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire</a>
<a id='line_10077'>  To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:</a>
<a id='line_10078'>  But now the last despair surrounds our host;</a>
<a id='line_10079'>  No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;</a>
<a id='line_10080'>  Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,</a>
<a id='line_10081'>  Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:</a>
<a id='line_10082'>  Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,</a>
<a id='line_10083'>  Employ thy youth as I employ my age;</a>
<a id='line_10084'>  Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;</a>
<a id='line_10085'>  He serves me most, who serves his country best."</a>
<a id='line_10086'></a>
<a id='line_10087'>  This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung</a>
<a id='line_10088'>  A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;</a>
<a id='line_10089'>  Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.</a>
<a id='line_10090'>  Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,</a>
<a id='line_10091'>  The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.</a>
<a id='line_10092'></a>
<a id='line_10093'>  And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;</a>
<a id='line_10094'>  A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:</a>
<a id='line_10095'>  The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,</a>
<a id='line_10096'>  And, couching close, repel invading sleep.</a>
<a id='line_10097'>  So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,</a>
<a id='line_10098'>  With toil protected from the prowling train;</a>
<a id='line_10099'>  When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,</a>
<a id='line_10100'>  Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:</a>
<a id='line_10101'>  Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;</a>
<a id='line_10102'>  Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear</a>
<a id='line_10103'>  Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,</a>
<a id='line_10104'>  Watch every side, and turn to every sound.</a>
<a id='line_10105'>  Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,</a>
<a id='line_10106'>  Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:</a>
<a id='line_10107'>  Each step of passing feet increased the affright;</a>
<a id='line_10108'>  And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.</a>
<a id='line_10109'>  Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_10110'>  And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.</a>
<a id='line_10111'>  "'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;</a>
<a id='line_10112'>  Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_10113'>  Watch thus, and Greece shall live." The hero said;</a>
<a id='line_10114'>  Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.</a>
<a id='line_10115'>  His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind</a>
<a id='line_10116'>  (For these the princes to their council join'd).</a>
<a id='line_10117'>  The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around</a>
<a id='line_10118'>  In silent state the consistory crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_10119'>  A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,</a>
<a id='line_10120'>  The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;</a>
<a id='line_10121'>  When night descending, from his vengeful hand</a>
<a id='line_10122'>  Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:</a>
<a id='line_10123'>  (The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,</a>
<a id='line_10124'>  And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)</a>
<a id='line_10125'>  There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,</a>
<a id='line_10126'>  The council opening, in these words begun:</a>
<a id='line_10127'></a>
<a id='line_10128'>  "Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,</a>
<a id='line_10129'>  His life to hazard, and his country save?</a>
<a id='line_10130'>  Lives there a man, who singly dares to go</a>
<a id='line_10131'>  To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?</a>
<a id='line_10132'>  Or favour'd by the night approach so near,</a>
<a id='line_10133'>  Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?</a>
<a id='line_10134'>  If to besiege our navies they prepare,</a>
<a id='line_10135'>  Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?</a>
<a id='line_10136'>  This could he learn, and to our peers recite,</a>
<a id='line_10137'>  And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;</a>
<a id='line_10138'>  What fame were his through all succeeding days,</a>
<a id='line_10139'>  While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!</a>
<a id='line_10140'>  What gifts his grateful country would bestow!</a>
<a id='line_10141'>  What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?</a>
<a id='line_10142'>  A sable ewe each leader should provide,</a>
<a id='line_10143'>  With each a sable lambkin by her side;</a>
<a id='line_10144'>  At every rite his share should be increased,</a>
<a id='line_10145'>  And his the foremost honours of the feast."</a>
<a id='line_10146'></a>
<a id='line_10147'>  Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,</a>
<a id='line_10148'>  Tydides spoke--"The man you seek is here.</a>
<a id='line_10149'>  Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,</a>
<a id='line_10150'>  Some god within commands, and I obey.</a>
<a id='line_10151'>  But let some other chosen warrior join,</a>
<a id='line_10152'>  To raise my hopes, and second my design.</a>
<a id='line_10153'>  By mutual confidence and mutual aid,</a>
<a id='line_10154'>  Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;</a>
<a id='line_10155'>  The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,</a>
<a id='line_10156'>  And one brave hero fans another's fire."</a>
<a id='line_10157'></a>
<a id='line_10158'>  Contending leaders at the word arose;</a>
<a id='line_10159'>  Each generous breast with emulation glows;</a>
<a id='line_10160'>  So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,</a>
<a id='line_10161'>  Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;</a>
<a id='line_10162'>  The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,</a>
<a id='line_10163'>  And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.</a>
<a id='line_10164'>  Then thus the king of men the contest ends:</a>
<a id='line_10165'>  "Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,</a>
<a id='line_10166'>  Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join</a>
<a id='line_10167'>  In this great enterprise, is only thine.</a>
<a id='line_10168'>  Just be thy choice, without affection made;</a>
<a id='line_10169'>  To birth, or office, no respect be paid;</a>
<a id='line_10170'>  Let worth determine here." The monarch spake,</a>
<a id='line_10171'>  And inly trembled for his brother's sake.</a>
<a id='line_10172'></a>
<a id='line_10173'>  "Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)</a>
<a id='line_10174'>  My choice declares the impulse of my mind.</a>
<a id='line_10175'>  How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands</a>
<a id='line_10176'>  To lend his counsels and assist our hands?</a>
<a id='line_10177'>  A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;</a>
<a id='line_10178'>  So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:</a>
<a id='line_10179'>  Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;</a>
<a id='line_10180'>  Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire."</a>
<a id='line_10181'></a>
<a id='line_10182'>  "It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,</a>
<a id='line_10183'>  (Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:</a>
<a id='line_10184'>  Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,</a>
<a id='line_10185'>  Are lost on hearers that our merits know.</a>
<a id='line_10186'>  But let us haste--Night rolls the hours away,</a>
<a id='line_10187'>  The reddening orient shows the coming day,</a>
<a id='line_10188'>  The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,</a>
<a id='line_10189'>  And of night's empire but a third remains."</a>
<a id='line_10190'></a>
<a id='line_10191'>  Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</a>
<a id='line_10192'>  In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.</a>
<a id='line_10193'>  A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,</a>
<a id='line_10194'>  And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:</a>
<a id='line_10195'>  Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,</a>
<a id='line_10196'>  Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:</a>
<a id='line_10197'>  (Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)</a>
<a id='line_10198'>  No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.</a>
<a id='line_10199'>  Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,</a>
<a id='line_10200'>  A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:</a>
<a id='line_10201'>  A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,</a>
<a id='line_10202'>  (Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_10203'>  Soft wool within; without, in order spread,(217)</a>
<a id='line_10204'>  A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.</a>
<a id='line_10205'>  This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,</a>
<a id='line_10206'>  Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,</a>
<a id='line_10207'>  And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize</a>
<a id='line_10208'>  Molus received, the pledge of social ties;</a>
<a id='line_10209'>  The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_10210'>  And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.</a>
<a id='line_10211'>  Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,</a>
<a id='line_10212'>  And dark through paths oblique their progress take.</a>
<a id='line_10213'>  Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,</a>
<a id='line_10214'>  A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:</a>
<a id='line_10215'>  This, though surrounding shades obscured their view.</a>
<a id='line_10216'>  By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.</a>
<a id='line_10217'>  As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,</a>
<a id='line_10218'>  Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:</a>
<a id='line_10219'></a>
<a id='line_10220'>  "O daughter of that god whose arm can wield</a>
<a id='line_10221'>  The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!</a>
<a id='line_10222'>  O thou! for ever present in my way,</a>
<a id='line_10223'>  Who all my motions, all my toils survey!</a>
<a id='line_10224'>  Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,</a>
<a id='line_10225'>  Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,</a>
<a id='line_10226'>  And let some deed this signal night adorn,</a>
<a id='line_10227'>  To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn."</a>
<a id='line_10228'></a>
<a id='line_10229'>  Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:</a>
<a id='line_10230'>  "Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.</a>
<a id='line_10231'>  Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,</a>
<a id='line_10232'>  As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.</a>
<a id='line_10233'>  When on AEsopus' banks the banded powers</a>
<a id='line_10234'>  Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,</a>
<a id='line_10235'>  Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,</a>
<a id='line_10236'>  He went a legate, but return'd a foe:</a>
<a id='line_10237'>  Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,</a>
<a id='line_10238'>  He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.</a>
<a id='line_10239'>  So now be present, O celestial maid!</a>
<a id='line_10240'>  So still continue to the race thine aid!</a>
<a id='line_10241'>  A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,</a>
<a id='line_10242'>  Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,</a>
<a id='line_10243'>  With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,</a>
<a id='line_10244'>  Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns."</a>
<a id='line_10245'>  The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies</a>
<a id='line_10246'>  Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.</a>
<a id='line_10247'>  Now, like two lions panting for the prey,</a>
<a id='line_10248'>  With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,</a>
<a id='line_10249'>  Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,</a>
<a id='line_10250'>  Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.</a>
<a id='line_10251'></a>
<a id='line_10252'>  Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_10253'>  On high designs the wakeful hours employ;</a>
<a id='line_10254'>  The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;</a>
<a id='line_10255'>  Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:</a>
<a id='line_10256'></a>
<a id='line_10257'>  "What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,</a>
<a id='line_10258'>  Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?</a>
<a id='line_10259'>  Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,</a>
<a id='line_10260'>  What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?</a>
<a id='line_10261'>  If now subdued they meditate their flight,</a>
<a id='line_10262'>  And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?</a>
<a id='line_10263'>  His be the chariot that shall please him most,</a>
<a id='line_10264'>  Of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host;</a>
<a id='line_10265'>  His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,</a>
<a id='line_10266'>  And his the glory to have served so well."</a>
<a id='line_10267'></a>
<a id='line_10268'>  A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,</a>
<a id='line_10269'>  Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,</a>
<a id='line_10270'>  (Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)</a>
<a id='line_10271'>  Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;</a>
<a id='line_10272'>  Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,</a>
<a id='line_10273'>  But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.</a>
<a id='line_10274'>  "Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet</a>
<a id='line_10275'>  This high achievement, and explore the fleet:</a>
<a id='line_10276'>  But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,</a>
<a id='line_10277'>  And swear to grant me the demanded prize;</a>
<a id='line_10278'>  The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,</a>
<a id='line_10279'>  That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.</a>
<a id='line_10280'>  Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,</a>
<a id='line_10281'>  Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,</a>
<a id='line_10282'>  Even to the royal tent pursue my way,</a>
<a id='line_10283'>  And all their counsels, all their aims betray."</a>
<a id='line_10284'></a>
<a id='line_10285'>  The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,</a>
<a id='line_10286'>  Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:</a>
<a id='line_10287'>  "Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!</a>
<a id='line_10288'>  Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:</a>
<a id='line_10289'>  By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,</a>
<a id='line_10290'>  And him alone the immortal steeds adorn."</a>
<a id='line_10291'></a>
<a id='line_10292'>  Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_10293'>  But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:</a>
<a id='line_10294'>  Across his back the bended bow he flung,</a>
<a id='line_10295'>  A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,</a>
<a id='line_10296'>  A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,</a>
<a id='line_10297'>  And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.</a>
<a id='line_10298'>  Then (never to return) he sought the shore,</a>
<a id='line_10299'>  And trod the path his feet must tread no more.</a>
<a id='line_10300'>  Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,</a>
<a id='line_10301'>  (Still bending forward as he coursed along,)</a>
<a id='line_10302'>  When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread</a>
<a id='line_10303'>  Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;</a>
<a id='line_10304'></a>
<a id='line_10305'>  "O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,</a>
<a id='line_10306'>  Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;</a>
<a id='line_10307'>  Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;</a>
<a id='line_10308'>  Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.</a>
<a id='line_10309'>  Yet let him pass, and win a little space;</a>
<a id='line_10310'>  Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.</a>
<a id='line_10311'>  But if too swift of foot he flies before,</a>
<a id='line_10312'>  Confine his course along the fleet and shore,</a>
<a id='line_10313'>  Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,</a>
<a id='line_10314'>  And intercept his hoped return to Troy."</a>
<a id='line_10315'></a>
<a id='line_10316'>  With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,</a>
<a id='line_10317'>  (As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:</a>
<a id='line_10318'>  Along the path the spy unwary flew;</a>
<a id='line_10319'>  Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.</a>
<a id='line_10320'>  So distant they, and such the space between,</a>
<a id='line_10321'>  As when two teams of mules divide the green,</a>
<a id='line_10322'>  (To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)</a>
<a id='line_10323'>  When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.</a>
<a id='line_10324'>  Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;</a>
<a id='line_10325'>  Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,</a>
<a id='line_10326'>  Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,</a>
<a id='line_10327'>  No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.</a>
<a id='line_10328'>  As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;</a>
<a id='line_10329'>  Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;</a>
<a id='line_10330'>  Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,</a>
<a id='line_10331'>  And from the herd still turn the flying prey:</a>
<a id='line_10332'>  So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;</a>
<a id='line_10333'>  So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.</a>
<a id='line_10334'>  Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,</a>
<a id='line_10335'>  And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;</a>
<a id='line_10336'>  When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought</a>
<a id='line_10337'>  (Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,</a>
<a id='line_10338'>  Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,</a>
<a id='line_10339'>  And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.</a>
<a id='line_10340'>  Then thus aloud: "Whoe'er thou art, remain;</a>
<a id='line_10341'>  This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain."</a>
<a id='line_10342'>  He said, and high in air the weapon cast,</a>
<a id='line_10343'>  Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;</a>
<a id='line_10344'>  Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood</a>
<a id='line_10345'>  The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;</a>
<a id='line_10346'>  A sudden palsy seized his turning head;</a>
<a id='line_10347'>  His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;</a>
<a id='line_10348'>  The panting warriors seize him as he stands,</a>
<a id='line_10349'>  And with unmanly tears his life demands.</a>
<a id='line_10350'></a>
<a id='line_10351'>  "O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,</a>
<a id='line_10352'>  Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:</a>
<a id='line_10353'>  Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,</a>
<a id='line_10354'>  And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold."</a>
<a id='line_10355'></a>
<a id='line_10356'>  To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:</a>
<a id='line_10357'>  "Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.</a>
<a id='line_10358'>  What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,</a>
<a id='line_10359'>  To roam the silent fields in dead of night?</a>
<a id='line_10360'>  Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,</a>
<a id='line_10361'>  By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?</a>
<a id='line_10362'>  Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,</a>
<a id='line_10363'>  Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?"</a>
<a id='line_10364'></a>
<a id='line_10365'>  Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:</a>
<a id='line_10366'>  (Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)</a>
<a id='line_10367'>  "Hither I came, by Hector's words deceived;</a>
<a id='line_10368'>  Much did he promise, rashly I believed:</a>
<a id='line_10369'>  No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,</a>
<a id='line_10370'>  And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,</a>
<a id='line_10371'>  Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;</a>
<a id='line_10372'>  To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:</a>
<a id='line_10373'>  If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,</a>
<a id='line_10374'>  And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night."</a>
<a id='line_10375'></a>
<a id='line_10376'>  "Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,</a>

<a id='line_10378'>  Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,</a>
<a id='line_10379'>  And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;</a>
<a id='line_10380'>  Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,</a>

<a id='line_10388'>  Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?"</a>
<a id='line_10389'></a>
<a id='line_10390'>  Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:</a>

<a id='line_10461'>  The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,</a>
<a id='line_10462'>  And points to Diomed the tempting prize.</a>
<a id='line_10463'>  "The man, the coursers, and the car behold!</a>

<a id='line_10473'>  His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,</a>
<a id='line_10474'>  Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,</a>
<a id='line_10475'>  And a low groan remurmur'd through the shore.</a>
<a id='line_10476'>  So the grim lion, from his nightly den,</a>
<a id='line_10477'>  O'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,</a>
<a id='line_10478'>  On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,</a>

<a id='line_10480'>  Nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand,</a>

<a id='line_10482'>  Ulysses following, as his partner slew,</a>
<a id='line_10483'>  Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew;</a>

<a id='line_10485'>  Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:</a>
<a id='line_10486'>  Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,</a>
<a id='line_10487'>  Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.</a>
<a id='line_10488'>  Now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found;</a>

<a id='line_10490'>  Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent,</a>
<a id='line_10491'>  A warlike form appear'd before his tent,</a>
<a id='line_10492'>  Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:</a>
<a id='line_10493'>  So dream'd the monarch, and awaked no more.(218)</a>
<a id='line_10494'></a>
<a id='line_10495'>  Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,</a>
<a id='line_10496'>  And leads them, fasten'd by the silver reins;</a>

<a id='line_10498'>  (The scourge forgot, on Rhesus' chariot hung;)</a>
<a id='line_10499'>  Then gave his friend the signal to retire;</a>
<a id='line_10500'>  But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;</a>
<a id='line_10501'>  Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade</a>

<a id='line_10505'>  While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,</a>

<a id='line_10511'>  Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy."</a>
<a id='line_10512'></a>
<a id='line_10513'>  The voice divine confess'd the martial maid;</a>
<a id='line_10514'>  In haste he mounted, and her word obey'd;</a>
<a id='line_10515'>  The coursers fly before Ulysses' bow,</a>

<a id='line_10522'>  Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power,</a>

<a id='line_10524'>  (On Rhesus' side accustom'd to attend,</a>
<a id='line_10525'>  A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)</a>
<a id='line_10526'>  He rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood,</a>
<a id='line_10527'>  An empty space where late the coursers stood,</a>
<a id='line_10528'>  The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;</a>
<a id='line_10529'>  For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:</a>
<a id='line_10530'>  Now while on Rhesus' name he calls in vain,</a>
<a id='line_10531'>  The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain;</a>
<a id='line_10532'>  On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,</a>
<a id='line_10533'>  And wondering view the slaughters of the night.</a>
<a id='line_10534'></a>
<a id='line_10535'>  Meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade</a>
<a id='line_10536'>  Where late the spoils of Hector's spy were laid,</a>
<a id='line_10537'>  Ulysses stopp'd; to him Tydides bore</a>
<a id='line_10538'>  The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon's gore:</a>
<a id='line_10539'>  Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet</a>

<a id='line_10560'>  Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,</a>

<a id='line_10562'>  With words of friendship and extended hands</a>
<a id='line_10563'>  They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:</a>

<a id='line_10617'>ARGUMENT</a>
<a id='line_10618'></a>
<a id='line_10619'>THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.</a>
<a id='line_10620'></a>
<a id='line_10621'>Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector</a>
<a id='line_10622'>prepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva</a>
<a id='line_10623'>give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is</a>
<a id='line_10624'>commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the</a>
<a id='line_10625'>engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field. He</a>
<a id='line_10626'>then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a stop</a>
<a id='line_10627'>to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged to</a>
<a id='line_10628'>desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded, and in</a>
<a id='line_10629'>the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against</a>
<a id='line_10630'>Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and rallies the Greeks. In</a>
<a id='line_10631'>the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an</a>
<a id='line_10632'>arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in Nestor's chariot. Achilles</a>
<a id='line_10633'>(who overlooked the action from his ship) sent Patroclus to inquire which</a>
<a id='line_10634'>of the Greeks was wounded in that manner; Nestor entertains him in his</a>
<a id='line_10635'>tent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of</a>
<a id='line_10636'>some former wars which he remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon</a>
<a id='line_10637'>persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him</a>
<a id='line_10638'>to do it, clad in Achilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets</a>
<a id='line_10639'>Eurypylus also wounded, and assists him in that distress.</a>
<a id='line_10640'></a>
<a id='line_10641'>This book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the same</a>
<a id='line_10642'>day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through the</a>
<a id='line_10643'>twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and</a>
<a id='line_10644'>part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the</a>
<a id='line_10645'>monument of Ilus.</a>

<a id='line_10650'>  And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:</a>
<a id='line_10651'>  When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,</a>
<a id='line_10652'>  The torch of discord blazing in her hand,</a>
<a id='line_10653'>  Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,</a>
<a id='line_10654'>  And, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.</a>
<a id='line_10655'>  High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand</a>
<a id='line_10656'>  She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.</a>
<a id='line_10657'></a>
<a id='line_10658'>  Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,</a>
<a id='line_10659'>  Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,</a>
<a id='line_10660'>  Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng</a>
<a id='line_10661'>  With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:</a>
<a id='line_10662'>  The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms</a>
<a id='line_10663'>  Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.</a>
<a id='line_10664'>  No more they sigh, inglorious to return,</a>
<a id='line_10665'>  But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.</a>

<a id='line_10837'></a>
<a id='line_10838'>  These words, attended with the flood of tears,</a>
<a id='line_10839'>  The youths address'd to unrelenting ears:</a>
<a id='line_10840'>  The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:</a>

<a id='line_10845'>  No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race."</a>
<a id='line_10846'></a>
<a id='line_10847'>  This said, Pisander from the car he cast,</a>

<a id='line_10850'>  The trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away;</a>
<a id='line_10851'>  His sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,</a>
<a id='line_10852'>  And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.</a>
<a id='line_10853'>  Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;</a>
<a id='line_10854'>  The king's example all his Greeks pursue.</a>
<a id='line_10855'>  Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,</a>

<a id='line_10857'>  From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,</a>
<a id='line_10858'>  Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.</a>
<a id='line_10859'>  The brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,</a>

<a id='line_10861'>  Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;</a>
<a id='line_10862'>  The distanced army wonders at his deeds,</a>
<a id='line_10863'>  As when the winds with raging flames conspire,</a>
<a id='line_10864'>  And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,</a>
<a id='line_10865'>  In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,</a>

<a id='line_10878'>  Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,</a>
<a id='line_10879'>  Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.</a>
<a id='line_10880'></a>
<a id='line_10881'>  Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,</a>
<a id='line_10882'>  Through the mid field the routed urge their way:</a>
<a id='line_10883'>  Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,</a>
<a id='line_10884'>  The path they take, and speed to reach the town.</a>
<a id='line_10885'>  As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,</a>
<a id='line_10886'>  Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.</a>
<a id='line_10887'>  Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,</a>

<a id='line_10889'>  Meanwhile on every side around the plain,</a>
<a id='line_10890'>  Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.</a>

<a id='line_10892'>  The lion's roaring through the midnight shade;</a>
<a id='line_10893'>  On heaps they tumble with successless haste;</a>
<a id='line_10894'>  The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.</a>
<a id='line_10895'>  Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,</a>
<a id='line_10896'>  Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;</a>
<a id='line_10897'>  Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,</a>

<a id='line_10899'></a>
<a id='line_10900'>  Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;</a>
<a id='line_10901'>  Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.</a>
<a id='line_10902'>  But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,</a>
<a id='line_10903'>  And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:</a>

<a id='line_10919'></a>
<a id='line_10920'>  He spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;</a>
<a id='line_10921'>  On wings of winds descends the various maid.</a>
<a id='line_10922'>  The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,</a>
<a id='line_10923'>  Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.</a>
<a id='line_10924'>  The goddess then: "O son of Priam, hear!</a>

<a id='line_10936'></a>
<a id='line_10937'>  She said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,</a>
<a id='line_10938'>  Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,</a>

<a id='line_10945'>  New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;</a>
<a id='line_10946'>  The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:</a>
<a id='line_10947'>  The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,</a>

<a id='line_10949'></a>
<a id='line_10950'>  Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,</a>
<a id='line_10951'>  Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?</a>
<a id='line_10952'>  The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,</a>
<a id='line_10953'>  From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;</a>
<a id='line_10954'>  Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,</a>
<a id='line_10955'>  And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.</a>
<a id='line_10956'>  Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,</a>
<a id='line_10957'>  And early honour warm his generous breast,</a>
<a id='line_10958'>  When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms</a>
<a id='line_10959'>  (Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.</a>
<a id='line_10960'>  But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,</a>

<a id='line_10962'>  From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10963'>  And swift to aid his dearer country flies.</a>
<a id='line_10964'>  With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,</a>
<a id='line_10965'>  Thence took the long laborious march by land.</a>
<a id='line_10966'>  Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,</a>
<a id='line_10967'>  Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.</a>
<a id='line_10968'>  Atrides first discharged the missive spear;</a>
<a id='line_10969'>  The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.</a>
<a id='line_10970'>  Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,</a>
<a id='line_10971'>  With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:</a>
<a id='line_10972'>  But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,</a>
<a id='line_10973'>  The point rebated, and repell'd the wound.</a>
<a id='line_10974'>  Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,</a>
<a id='line_10975'>  Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;</a>
<a id='line_10976'>  At once his weighty sword discharged a wound</a>
<a id='line_10977'>  Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_10978'>  Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,</a>

<a id='line_10980'>  Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!</a>
<a id='line_10981'>  Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!</a>
<a id='line_10982'>  No more the youth shall join his consort's side,</a>
<a id='line_10983'>  At once a virgin, and at once a bride!</a>
<a id='line_10984'>  No more with presents her embraces meet,</a>
<a id='line_10985'>  Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,</a>
<a id='line_10986'>  On whom his passion, lavish of his store,</a>
<a id='line_10987'>  Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!</a>
<a id='line_10988'>  Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,</a>
<a id='line_10989'>  While the proud victor bore his arms away.</a>
<a id='line_10990'></a>
<a id='line_10991'>  Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:</a>
<a id='line_10992'>  Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,</a>
<a id='line_10993'>  While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,</a>
<a id='line_10994'>  And the pale features now deform'd with blood.</a>
<a id='line_10995'>  Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,</a>
<a id='line_10996'>  Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.</a>
<a id='line_10997'>  The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,</a>
<a id='line_10998'>  And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.</a>
<a id='line_10999'>  Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear</a>
<a id='line_11000'>  On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:</a>
<a id='line_11001'>  His brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,</a>
<a id='line_11002'>  And calls his country to assert his cause;</a>
<a id='line_11003'>  Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,</a>
<a id='line_11004'>  And o'er the body spreads his ample shield.</a>
<a id='line_11005'>  Atrides, marking an unguarded part,</a>
<a id='line_11006'>  Transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;</a>
<a id='line_11007'>  Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,</a>
<a id='line_11008'>  The monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:</a>
<a id='line_11009'>  The social shades the same dark journey go,</a>
<a id='line_11010'>  And join each other in the realms below.</a>
<a id='line_11011'></a>
<a id='line_11012'>  The vengeful victor rages round the fields,</a>
<a id='line_11013'>  With every weapon art or fury yields:</a>
<a id='line_11014'>  By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,</a>
<a id='line_11015'>  Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.</a>
<a id='line_11016'>  This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;</a>
<a id='line_11017'>  But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,</a>
<a id='line_11018'>  Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,</a>
<a id='line_11019'>  Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:</a>
<a id='line_11020'>  (The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,</a>
<a id='line_11021'>  Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)</a>
<a id='line_11022'>  Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,</a>
<a id='line_11023'>  He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;</a>
<a id='line_11024'>  Then with a voice which fury made more strong,</a>
<a id='line_11025'>  And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:</a>
<a id='line_11026'></a>
<a id='line_11027'>  "O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;</a>

<a id='line_11031'></a>
<a id='line_11032'>  He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;</a>

<a id='line_11036'>  Shot through the battle in a moment's space,</a>
<a id='line_11037'>  The wounded monarch at his tent they place.</a>
<a id='line_11038'></a>
<a id='line_11039'>  No sooner Hector saw the king retired,</a>
<a id='line_11040'>  But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:</a>
<a id='line_11041'>  "Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!</a>

<a id='line_11049'></a>
<a id='line_11050'>  With words like these the fiery chief alarms</a>
<a id='line_11051'>  His fainting host, and every bosom warms.</a>
<a id='line_11052'>  As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear</a>

<a id='line_11090'>  And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain."</a>
<a id='line_11091'></a>
<a id='line_11092'>  He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,</a>

<a id='line_11132'>  Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced</a>
<a id='line_11133'>  Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.</a>
<a id='line_11134'>  Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus' hands)</a>

<a id='line_11138'>  O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,</a>
<a id='line_11139'>  And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.</a>
<a id='line_11140'>  Tydides followed to regain his lance;</a>
<a id='line_11141'>  While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,</a>
<a id='line_11142'>  Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:</a>
<a id='line_11143'>  The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:</a>
<a id='line_11144'>  "Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,</a>

<a id='line_11154'>  (The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)</a>
<a id='line_11155'>  Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,</a>
<a id='line_11156'>  From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:</a>
<a id='line_11157'>  Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,</a>
<a id='line_11158'>  And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;</a>
<a id='line_11159'>  Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest</a>

<a id='line_11161'>  The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,</a>

<a id='line_11163'>  The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.</a>
<a id='line_11164'>  Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.</a>

<a id='line_11172'></a>
<a id='line_11173'>  He dauntless thus: "Thou conqueror of the fair,</a>
<a id='line_11174'>  Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;</a>
<a id='line_11175'>  Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,</a>
<a id='line_11176'>  Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!</a>
<a id='line_11177'>  Thou hast but done what boys or women can;</a>
<a id='line_11178'>  Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.</a>
<a id='line_11179'>  Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,</a>
<a id='line_11180'>  A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.</a>

<a id='line_11183'>  Where this but lights, some noble life expires;</a>
<a id='line_11184'>  Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,</a>
<a id='line_11185'>  Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,</a>
<a id='line_11186'>  And leaves such objects as distract the fair."</a>
<a id='line_11187'>  Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,</a>
<a id='line_11188'>  Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:</a>
<a id='line_11189'>  Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;</a>
<a id='line_11190'>  Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.</a>
<a id='line_11191'></a>
<a id='line_11192'>  Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,</a>
<a id='line_11193'>  The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;</a>
<a id='line_11194'>  But stands collected in himself, and whole,</a>
<a id='line_11195'>  And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:</a>
<a id='line_11196'></a>
<a id='line_11197'>  "What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?</a>
<a id='line_11198'>  What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?</a>
<a id='line_11199'>  What danger, singly if I stand the ground,</a>
<a id='line_11200'>  My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?</a>
<a id='line_11201'>  Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,</a>
<a id='line_11202'>  The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.</a>
<a id='line_11203'>  To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;</a>
<a id='line_11204'>  And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part."</a>
<a id='line_11205'></a>
<a id='line_11206'>  Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,</a>
<a id='line_11207'>  Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;</a>
<a id='line_11208'>  These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;</a>
<a id='line_11209'>  And round him deep the steely circle grows.</a>
<a id='line_11210'>  So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds</a>
<a id='line_11211'>  Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;</a>
<a id='line_11212'>  He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;</a>
<a id='line_11213'>  His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;</a>
<a id='line_11214'>  By these, by those, on every part is plied;</a>
<a id='line_11215'>  And the red slaughter spreads on every side.</a>
<a id='line_11216'>  Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;</a>
<a id='line_11217'>  Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;</a>
<a id='line_11218'>  Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,</a>
<a id='line_11219'>  Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.</a>
<a id='line_11220'>  Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;</a>
<a id='line_11221'>  Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;</a>
<a id='line_11222'>  But to his aid his brother Socus flies,</a>
<a id='line_11223'>  Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.</a>
<a id='line_11224'>  Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:</a>
<a id='line_11225'></a>
<a id='line_11226'>  "O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!</a>
<a id='line_11227'>  Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,</a>
<a id='line_11228'>  Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!</a>
<a id='line_11229'>  This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,</a>
<a id='line_11230'>  And end at once the great Hippasian race,</a>
<a id='line_11231'>  Or thou beneath this lance must press the field."</a>
<a id='line_11232'>  He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:</a>
<a id='line_11233'>  Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,</a>
<a id='line_11234'>  Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.</a>
<a id='line_11235'>  By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,</a>
<a id='line_11236'>  Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.</a>
<a id='line_11237'></a>
<a id='line_11238'>  The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,</a>
<a id='line_11239'>  Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):</a>
<a id='line_11240'>  "Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,</a>
<a id='line_11241'>  Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.</a>
<a id='line_11242'>  Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;</a>
<a id='line_11243'>  But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,</a>
<a id='line_11244'>  And add one spectre to the realms below!"</a>
<a id='line_11245'></a>
<a id='line_11246'>  He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,</a>
<a id='line_11247'>  Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;</a>
<a id='line_11248'>  Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,</a>
<a id='line_11249'>  And held its passage through the panting heart:</a>
<a id='line_11250'>  Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;</a>
<a id='line_11251'>  He falls; his armour rings against the ground.</a>
<a id='line_11252'>  Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:</a>
<a id='line_11253'>  "Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;</a>
<a id='line_11254'>  There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,</a>
<a id='line_11255'>  Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.</a>
<a id='line_11256'>  Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;</a>
<a id='line_11257'>  Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;</a>
<a id='line_11258'>  But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,</a>
<a id='line_11259'>  And hovering vultures scream around their prey.</a>
<a id='line_11260'>  Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,</a>
<a id='line_11261'>  With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."</a>
<a id='line_11262'></a>
<a id='line_11263'>  Then raging with intolerable smart,</a>
<a id='line_11264'>  He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.</a>
<a id='line_11265'>  The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,</a>
<a id='line_11266'>  And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.</a>
<a id='line_11267'>  Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,</a>
<a id='line_11268'>  Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.</a>
<a id='line_11269'>  Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;</a>
<a id='line_11270'>  The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:</a>
<a id='line_11271'>  Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,</a>
<a id='line_11272'>  Who shares his labours, and defends his side:</a>
<a id='line_11273'>  "O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;</a>
<a id='line_11274'>  Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;</a>
<a id='line_11275'>  Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,</a>
<a id='line_11276'>  Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.</a>
<a id='line_11277'>  Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,</a>
<a id='line_11278'>  And feel a loss not ages can repair."</a>
<a id='line_11279'></a>
<a id='line_11280'>  Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;</a>
<a id='line_11281'>  Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,</a>
<a id='line_11282'>  The prudent chief in sore distress they found,</a>
<a id='line_11283'>  With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.(223)</a>
<a id='line_11284'>  As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,</a>
<a id='line_11285'>  From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;</a>
<a id='line_11286'>  Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,</a>
<a id='line_11287'>  He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,</a>
<a id='line_11288'>  Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,</a>
<a id='line_11289'>  Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:</a>
<a id='line_11290'>  Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,</a>
<a id='line_11291'>  The lion rushes through the woodland shade,</a>
<a id='line_11292'>  The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;</a>
<a id='line_11293'>  The lordly savage vindicates his prey.</a>
<a id='line_11294'>  Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,</a>
<a id='line_11295'>  A single warrior half a host sustains:</a>
<a id='line_11296'>  But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,</a>
<a id='line_11297'>  The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;</a>
<a id='line_11298'>  Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,</a>
<a id='line_11299'>  And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.</a>
<a id='line_11300'></a>
<a id='line_11301'>  Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;</a>
<a id='line_11302'>  And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,</a>
<a id='line_11303'>  On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,</a>
<a id='line_11304'>  And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_11305'>  As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,</a>
<a id='line_11306'>  Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,</a>
<a id='line_11307'>  And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,</a>

<a id='line_11309'>  Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;</a>
<a id='line_11310'>  Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.</a>
<a id='line_11311'></a>
<a id='line_11312'>  But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,</a>

<a id='line_11330'>  Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode</a>
<a id='line_11331'>  The wounded offspring of the healing god.</a>
<a id='line_11332'>  He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet</a>
<a id='line_11333'>  Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.</a>
<a id='line_11334'></a>
<a id='line_11335'>  But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,</a>
<a id='line_11336'>  Survey'd the various fortune of the war:</a>

<a id='line_11362'>  But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,</a>
<a id='line_11363'>  Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;</a>
<a id='line_11364'>  Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,</a>
<a id='line_11365'>  Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.</a>
<a id='line_11366'>  O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,</a>
<a id='line_11367'>  And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_11368'>  Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,</a>
<a id='line_11369'>  Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;</a>
<a id='line_11370'>  Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,</a>
<a id='line_11371'>  Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,</a>
<a id='line_11372'>  Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;</a>
<a id='line_11373'>  Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:</a>
<a id='line_11374'>  So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,</a>
<a id='line_11375'>  While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.</a>
<a id='line_11376'></a>
<a id='line_11377'>  As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,</a>
<a id='line_11378'>  In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,</a>
<a id='line_11379'>  Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,</a>
<a id='line_11380'>  Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;</a>
<a id='line_11381'>  Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,</a>
<a id='line_11382'>  The patient animal maintains his ground,</a>
<a id='line_11383'>  Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,</a>
<a id='line_11384'>  And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:</a>
<a id='line_11385'>  On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,</a>
<a id='line_11386'>  The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;</a>
<a id='line_11387'>  Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,</a>
<a id='line_11388'>  Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;</a>
<a id='line_11389'>  Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,</a>
<a id='line_11390'>  And threats his followers with retorted eye.</a>
<a id='line_11391'>  Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,</a>
<a id='line_11392'>  While hissing darts descend in iron showers:</a>
<a id='line_11393'>  In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,</a>
<a id='line_11394'>  Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;</a>
<a id='line_11395'>  And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_11396'>  Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.</a>
<a id='line_11397'>  But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,</a>
<a id='line_11398'>  And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;</a>
<a id='line_11399'>  Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,</a>
<a id='line_11400'>  Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;</a>
<a id='line_11401'>  From his torn liver the red current flow'd,</a>
<a id='line_11402'>  And his slack knees desert their dying load.</a>
<a id='line_11403'>  The victor rushing to despoil the dead,</a>
<a id='line_11404'>  From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;</a>
<a id='line_11405'>  Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,</a>
<a id='line_11406'>  Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.</a>
<a id='line_11407'>  Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,</a>
<a id='line_11408'>  Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:</a>
<a id='line_11409'></a>
<a id='line_11410'>  "What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?</a>
<a id='line_11411'>  Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.</a>
<a id='line_11412'>  This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,</a>
<a id='line_11413'>  And this the last brave battle he shall wage:</a>
<a id='line_11414'>  Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave</a>
<a id='line_11415'>  The warrior rescue, and your country save."</a>
<a id='line_11416'>  Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,</a>
<a id='line_11417'>  Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,</a>
<a id='line_11418'>  To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand</a>
<a id='line_11419'>  With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:</a>
<a id='line_11420'>  Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;</a>
<a id='line_11421'>  The hero rallies, and renews the fight.</a>
<a id='line_11422'></a>
<a id='line_11423'>  Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,</a>
<a id='line_11424'>  While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:</a>
<a id='line_11425'>  His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,</a>
<a id='line_11426'>  The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.</a>
<a id='line_11427'>  That hour Achilles, from the topmost height</a>
<a id='line_11428'>  Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;</a>
<a id='line_11429'>  His feasted eyes beheld around the plain</a>
<a id='line_11430'>  The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.</a>
<a id='line_11431'>  His friend Machaon singled from the rest,</a>
<a id='line_11432'>  A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.</a>
<a id='line_11433'>  Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:</a>
<a id='line_11434'>  Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;</a>
<a id='line_11435'>  In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,</a>
<a id='line_11436'>  And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.</a>
<a id='line_11437'></a>
<a id='line_11438'>  "Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;</a>
<a id='line_11439'>  Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."</a>
<a id='line_11440'></a>
<a id='line_11441'>  "O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)</a>

<a id='line_11453'></a>
<a id='line_11454'>  The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,</a>
<a id='line_11455'>  Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;</a>
<a id='line_11456'>  The chiefs descending from their car he found:</a>

<a id='line_11459'>  To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,</a>
<a id='line_11460'>  Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale</a>
<a id='line_11461'>  Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;</a>
<a id='line_11462'>  Then to consult on farther methods went,</a>
<a id='line_11463'>  And took their seats beneath the shady tent.</a>
<a id='line_11464'>  The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,</a>

<a id='line_11708'>THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.</a>
<a id='line_11709'></a>
<a id='line_11710'>The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to</a>
<a id='line_11711'>force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises</a>
<a id='line_11712'>to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans follow</a>
<a id='line_11713'>his counsel; and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin</a>
<a id='line_11714'>the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons,</a>
<a id='line_11715'>which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to</a>
<a id='line_11716'>withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in</a>
<a id='line_11717'>which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall.</a>
<a id='line_11718'>Hector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates,</a>
<a id='line_11719'>and enters at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians</a>
<a id='line_11720'>even to their ships.</a>
<a id='line_11721'></a>
<a id='line_11722'>  While thus the hero's pious cares attend</a>
<a id='line_11723'>  The cure and safety of his wounded friend,</a>
<a id='line_11724'>  Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,</a>
<a id='line_11725'>  And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.</a>
<a id='line_11726'>  Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;</a>
<a id='line_11727'>  With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;</a>
<a id='line_11728'>  Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,</a>
<a id='line_11729'>  The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.</a>
<a id='line_11730'></a>
<a id='line_11731'>  Without the gods, how short a period stands</a>
<a id='line_11732'>  The proudest monument of mortal hands!</a>
<a id='line_11733'>  This stood while Hector and Achilles raged.</a>
<a id='line_11734'>  While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;</a>
<a id='line_11735'>  But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,</a>
<a id='line_11736'>  And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;</a>
<a id='line_11737'>  Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,</a>
<a id='line_11738'>  Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;</a>
<a id='line_11739'>  Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,</a>
<a id='line_11740'>  Caresus roaring down the stony hills,</a>
<a id='line_11741'>  AEsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,</a>
<a id='line_11742'>  And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;</a>
<a id='line_11743'>  And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main(224)</a>
<a id='line_11744'>  Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:</a>
<a id='line_11745'>  These, turn'd by Phoebus from their wonted ways,</a>
<a id='line_11746'>  Deluged the rampire nine continual days;</a>
<a id='line_11747'>  The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,</a>
<a id='line_11748'>  And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.</a>
<a id='line_11749'>  Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,</a>
<a id='line_11750'>  And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.</a>
<a id='line_11751'>  The god of ocean, marching stern before,</a>
<a id='line_11752'>  With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,</a>
<a id='line_11753'>  Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,</a>
<a id='line_11754'>  And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.</a>
<a id='line_11755'>  Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,</a>
<a id='line_11756'>  No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;</a>
<a id='line_11757'>  In their old bounds the rivers roll again,</a>
<a id='line_11758'>  Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.(225)</a>
<a id='line_11759'></a>
<a id='line_11760'>  But this the gods in later times perform;</a>
<a id='line_11761'>  As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;</a>
<a id='line_11762'>  The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;</a>
<a id='line_11763'>  War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.</a>
<a id='line_11764'>  Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,</a>
<a id='line_11765'>  Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:</a>
<a id='line_11766'>  Hector's approach in every wind they hear,</a>
<a id='line_11767'>  And Hector's fury every moment fear.</a>
<a id='line_11768'>  He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,</a>
<a id='line_11769'>  Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.</a>
<a id='line_11770'>  So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,</a>
<a id='line_11771'>  Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;</a>
<a id='line_11772'>  Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,</a>
<a id='line_11773'>  And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:</a>
<a id='line_11774'>  His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,</a>
<a id='line_11775'>  And where he turns the rout disperse or die:</a>
<a id='line_11776'>  He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,</a>
<a id='line_11777'>  And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.</a>
<a id='line_11778'>  With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;</a>
<a id='line_11779'>  Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.</a>
<a id='line_11780'>  The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,</a>
<a id='line_11781'>  And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;</a>
<a id='line_11782'>  Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,</a>
<a id='line_11783'>  And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.</a>
<a id='line_11784'>  Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,</a>
<a id='line_11785'>  Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;</a>
<a id='line_11786'>  The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)</a>
<a id='line_11787'>  And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.</a>
<a id='line_11788'>  The foot alone this strong defence could force,</a>
<a id='line_11789'>  And try the pass impervious to the horse.</a>
<a id='line_11790'>  This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,</a>
<a id='line_11791'>  Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:</a>
<a id='line_11792'></a>
<a id='line_11793'>  "O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!</a>
<a id='line_11794'>  And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!</a>
<a id='line_11795'>  What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,</a>
<a id='line_11796'>  The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?</a>
<a id='line_11797'>  No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,</a>
<a id='line_11798'>  No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.</a>
<a id='line_11799'>  Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,</a>
<a id='line_11800'>  On certain dangers we too rashly run:</a>
<a id='line_11801'>  If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,</a>
<a id='line_11802'>  Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!</a>
<a id='line_11803'>  Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,</a>
<a id='line_11804'>  And one great day destroy and bury all!</a>
<a id='line_11805'>  But should they turn, and here oppress our train,</a>
<a id='line_11806'>  What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?</a>
<a id='line_11807'>  Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,</a>
<a id='line_11808'>  In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,</a>
<a id='line_11809'>  All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,</a>
<a id='line_11810'>  Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.</a>
<a id='line_11811'>  Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;</a>
<a id='line_11812'>  Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;</a>
<a id='line_11813'>  Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,</a>
<a id='line_11814'>  Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.</a>
<a id='line_11815'>  So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,</a>
<a id='line_11816'>  And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."</a>

<a id='line_11821'></a>
<a id='line_11822'></a>
<a id='line_11823'>  This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung</a>
<a id='line_11824'>  Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.</a>
<a id='line_11825'>  The chief's example follow'd by his train,</a>
<a id='line_11826'>  Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_11827'>  By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd</a>
<a id='line_11828'>  Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.</a>
<a id='line_11829'>  The forces part in five distinguish'd bands,</a>
<a id='line_11830'>  And all obey their several chiefs' commands.</a>
<a id='line_11831'>  The best and bravest in the first conspire,</a>
<a id='line_11832'>  Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:</a>
<a id='line_11833'>  Great Hector glorious in the van of these,</a>
<a id='line_11834'>  Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.</a>
<a id='line_11835'>  Before the next the graceful Paris shines,</a>
<a id='line_11836'>  And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.</a>
<a id='line_11837'>  The sons of Priam with the third appear,</a>
<a id='line_11838'>  Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;</a>
<a id='line_11839'>  In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,</a>
<a id='line_11840'>  Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,</a>
<a id='line_11841'>  And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore,</a>
<a id='line_11842'>  The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore.</a>
<a id='line_11843'>  Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,</a>
<a id='line_11844'>  And great AEneas, born on fountful Ide.</a>
<a id='line_11845'>  Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd,</a>
<a id='line_11846'>  Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.</a>
<a id='line_11847'>  Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,</a>
<a id='line_11848'>  But he more brave than all the hosts he led.</a>
<a id='line_11849'></a>
<a id='line_11850'>  Now with compacted shields in close array,</a>
<a id='line_11851'>  The moving legions speed their headlong way:</a>
<a id='line_11852'>  Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,</a>
<a id='line_11853'>  And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.</a>
<a id='line_11854'></a>
<a id='line_11855'>  While every Trojan thus, and every aid,</a>
<a id='line_11856'>  The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,</a>
<a id='line_11857'>  Asius alone, confiding in his car,</a>
<a id='line_11858'>  His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.</a>
<a id='line_11859'>  Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;</a>
<a id='line_11860'>  Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;</a>
<a id='line_11861'>  No more those coursers with triumphant joy</a>
<a id='line_11862'>  Restore their master to the gates of Troy!</a>
<a id='line_11863'>  Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,</a>
<a id='line_11864'>  And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!</a>
<a id='line_11865'>  Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain</a>
<a id='line_11866'>  The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;</a>
<a id='line_11867'>  Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_11868'>  The gates half-open'd to receive the last.</a>
<a id='line_11869'>  Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:</a>
<a id='line_11870'>  His following host with clamours rend the skies:</a>
<a id='line_11871'>  To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,</a>
<a id='line_11872'>  Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!</a>
<a id='line_11873'></a>
<a id='line_11874'>  To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,</a>
<a id='line_11875'>  Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;</a>
<a id='line_11876'>  This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir,</a>
<a id='line_11877'>  And that Leonteus, like the god of war.</a>
<a id='line_11878'>  As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;</a>
<a id='line_11879'>  Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:</a>
<a id='line_11880'>  Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_11881'>  Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;</a>
<a id='line_11882'>  High on the hills appears their stately form,</a>
<a id='line_11883'>  And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.</a>
<a id='line_11884'>  So graceful these, and so the shock they stand</a>
<a id='line_11885'>  Of raging Asius, and his furious band.</a>
<a id='line_11886'>  Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,</a>
<a id='line_11887'>  And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:</a>
<a id='line_11888'>  In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,</a>
<a id='line_11889'>  In vain around them beat their hollow shields;</a>
<a id='line_11890'>  The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,</a>
<a id='line_11891'>  To guard their navies, and defend the wall.</a>
<a id='line_11892'>  Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,</a>
<a id='line_11893'>  And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,</a>
<a id='line_11894'>  Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,</a>
<a id='line_11895'>  Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.</a>
<a id='line_11896'>  So two wild boars spring furious from their den,</a>
<a id='line_11897'>  Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;</a>
<a id='line_11898'>  On every side the crackling trees they tear,</a>
<a id='line_11899'>  And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;</a>
<a id='line_11900'>  They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,</a>
<a id='line_11901'>  Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.</a>
<a id='line_11902'>  Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,</a>
<a id='line_11903'>  With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;</a>
<a id='line_11904'>  Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers</a>
<a id='line_11905'>  Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:</a>
<a id='line_11906'>  To save their fleet their last efforts they try,</a>
<a id='line_11907'>  And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</a>
<a id='line_11908'></a>
<a id='line_11909'>  As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings</a>
<a id='line_11910'>  The dreary winter on his frozen wings;</a>
<a id='line_11911'>  Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow</a>
<a id='line_11912'>  Descend, and whiten all the fields below:</a>
<a id='line_11913'>  So fast the darts on either army pour,</a>
<a id='line_11914'>  So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:</a>
<a id='line_11915'>  Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,</a>
<a id='line_11916'>  And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</a>
<a id='line_11917'></a>
<a id='line_11918'>  With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,</a>
<a id='line_11919'>  The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:</a>
<a id='line_11920'>  "In powers immortal who shall now believe?</a>
<a id='line_11921'>  Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?</a>
<a id='line_11922'>  What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power</a>
<a id='line_11923'>  Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?</a>
<a id='line_11924'>  But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,</a>
<a id='line_11925'>  To guard the entrance of their common hive,</a>
<a id='line_11926'>  Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings</a>
<a id='line_11927'>  They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;</a>
<a id='line_11928'>  A race determined, that to death contend:</a>
<a id='line_11929'>  So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.</a>
<a id='line_11930'>  Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,</a>
<a id='line_11931'>  Repel an army, and defraud the fates?"</a>
<a id='line_11932'></a>
<a id='line_11933'>  These empty accents mingled with the wind,</a>
<a id='line_11934'>  Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;</a>
<a id='line_11935'>  To godlike Hector and his matchless might</a>
<a id='line_11936'>  Was owed the glory of the destined fight.</a>
<a id='line_11937'>  Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,</a>
<a id='line_11938'>  And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;</a>
<a id='line_11939'>  Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,</a>
<a id='line_11940'>  The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.</a>
<a id='line_11941'>  The spirit of a god my breast inspire,</a>
<a id='line_11942'>  To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!</a>
<a id='line_11943'>  While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,</a>
<a id='line_11944'>  Secure of death, confiding in despair;</a>
<a id='line_11945'>  And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,</a>
<a id='line_11946'>  With unassisting arms deplored the day.</a>
<a id='line_11947'></a>
<a id='line_11948'>  Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain</a>
<a id='line_11949'>  The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.</a>
<a id='line_11950'>  First Damasus, by Polypoetes' steel,</a>
<a id='line_11951'>  Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;</a>
<a id='line_11952'>  The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!</a>
<a id='line_11953'>  The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!</a>
<a id='line_11954'>  Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:</a>
<a id='line_11955'>  Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;</a>
<a id='line_11956'>  First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,</a>
<a id='line_11957'>  Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:</a>
<a id='line_11958'>  Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,</a>
<a id='line_11959'>  The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:</a>
<a id='line_11960'>  Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;</a>
<a id='line_11961'>  And round him rose a monument of dead.</a>
<a id='line_11962'>  Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,</a>
<a id='line_11963'>  Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;</a>
<a id='line_11964'>  Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,</a>
<a id='line_11965'>  And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.</a>
<a id='line_11966'>  These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,</a>
<a id='line_11967'>  By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:</a>
<a id='line_11968'>  A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,</a>
<a id='line_11969'>  Their martial fury in their wonder lost.</a>
<a id='line_11970'>  Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;</a>
<a id='line_11971'>  A bleeding serpent of enormous size,</a>
<a id='line_11972'>  His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,</a>
<a id='line_11973'>  He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:</a>
<a id='line_11974'>  Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,</a>
<a id='line_11975'>  In airy circles wings his painful way,</a>
<a id='line_11976'>  Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:</a>
<a id='line_11977'>  Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.</a>
<a id='line_11978'>  They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,</a>
<a id='line_11979'>  And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.</a>
<a id='line_11980'>  Then first Polydamas the silence broke,</a>
<a id='line_11981'>  Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:</a>
<a id='line_11982'></a>
<a id='line_11983'>  "How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,</a>
<a id='line_11984'>  For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?</a>
<a id='line_11985'>  True to those counsels which I judge the best,</a>
<a id='line_11986'>  I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.</a>
<a id='line_11987'>  To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,</a>
<a id='line_11988'>  In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;</a>
<a id='line_11989'>  And all I move, deferring to thy sway,</a>
<a id='line_11990'>  But tends to raise that power which I obey.</a>
<a id='line_11991'>  Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!</a>
<a id='line_11992'>  Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;</a>
<a id='line_11993'>  For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,</a>
<a id='line_11994'>  And thus my mind explains its clear event:</a>
<a id='line_11995'>  The victor eagle, whose sinister flight</a>
<a id='line_11996'>  Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,</a>
<a id='line_11997'>  Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,</a>
<a id='line_11998'>  Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;</a>
<a id='line_11999'>  Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,</a>
<a id='line_12000'>  Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,</a>
<a id='line_12001'>  Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;</a>
<a id='line_12002'>  More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.</a>
<a id='line_12003'>  So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;</a>
<a id='line_12004'>  For thus a skilful seer would read the skies."</a>
<a id='line_12005'></a>
<a id='line_12006'>  To him then Hector with disdain return'd:</a>
<a id='line_12007'>  (Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)</a>
<a id='line_12008'>  "Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?</a>
<a id='line_12009'>  Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:</a>
<a id='line_12010'>  Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,</a>
<a id='line_12011'>  Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.</a>
<a id='line_12012'>  What coward counsels would thy madness move</a>
<a id='line_12013'>  Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?</a>
<a id='line_12014'>  The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,</a>
<a id='line_12015'>  And happy thunders of the favouring god,</a>
<a id='line_12016'>  These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind</a>
<a id='line_12017'>  By wandering birds that flit with every wind?</a>
<a id='line_12018'>  Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,</a>
<a id='line_12019'>  Or where the suns arise, or where descend;</a>
<a id='line_12020'>  To right, to left, unheeded take your way,</a>
<a id='line_12021'>  While I the dictates of high heaven obey.</a>
<a id='line_12022'>  Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,</a>
<a id='line_12023'>  And asks no omen but his country's cause.</a>
<a id='line_12024'>  But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?</a>
<a id='line_12025'>  None fears it more, as none promotes it less:</a>
<a id='line_12026'>  Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,</a>
<a id='line_12027'>  Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.</a>
<a id='line_12028'>  Troy and her sons may find a general grave,</a>
<a id='line_12029'>  But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.</a>
<a id='line_12030'>  Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests</a>
<a id='line_12031'>  Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,</a>
<a id='line_12032'>  My javelin can revenge so base a part,</a>
<a id='line_12033'>  And free the soul that quivers in thy heart."</a>
<a id='line_12034'></a>
<a id='line_12035'>  Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,</a>
<a id='line_12036'>  Calls on his host; his host obey the call;</a>
<a id='line_12037'>  With ardour follow where their leader flies:</a>
<a id='line_12038'>  Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_12039'>  Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,</a>
<a id='line_12040'>  And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;</a>
<a id='line_12041'>  He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,</a>
<a id='line_12042'>  And gives great Hector the predestined day.</a>
<a id='line_12043'>  Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,</a>
<a id='line_12044'>  Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.</a>
<a id='line_12045'>  In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,</a>
<a id='line_12046'>  While these they undermine, and those they rend;</a>
<a id='line_12047'>  Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;</a>
<a id='line_12048'>  And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.</a>
<a id='line_12049'>  Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;</a>
<a id='line_12050'>  The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,</a>
<a id='line_12051'>  Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;</a>
<a id='line_12052'>  Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.</a>
<a id='line_12053'>  The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,</a>
<a id='line_12054'>  And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.</a>
<a id='line_12055'>  The generous impulse every Greek obeys;</a>
<a id='line_12056'>  Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.</a>
<a id='line_12057'></a>
<a id='line_12058'>  "Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,</a>

<a id='line_12060'>  Since not alike endued with force or art;</a>
<a id='line_12061'>  Behold a day when each may act his part!</a>
<a id='line_12062'>  A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,</a>
<a id='line_12063'>  To gain new glories, or augment the old.</a>
<a id='line_12064'>  Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;</a>

<a id='line_12066'>  Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;</a>
<a id='line_12067'>  Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;</a>
<a id='line_12068'>  So Jove once more may drive their routed train,</a>
<a id='line_12069'>  And Troy lie trembling in her walls again."</a>
<a id='line_12070'></a>
<a id='line_12071'>  Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;</a>
<a id='line_12072'>  And now the stones descend in heavier showers.</a>
<a id='line_12073'>  As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,</a>
<a id='line_12074'>  And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;</a>
<a id='line_12075'>  In winter's bleak un comfortable reign,</a>
<a id='line_12076'>  A snowy inundation hides the plain;</a>
<a id='line_12077'>  He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;</a>
<a id='line_12078'>  Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;</a>
<a id='line_12079'>  And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_12080'>  Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;</a>
<a id='line_12081'>  Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,</a>
<a id='line_12082'>  And one bright waste hides all the works of men:</a>
<a id='line_12083'>  The circling seas, alone absorbing all,</a>
<a id='line_12084'>  Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:</a>
<a id='line_12085'>  So from each side increased the stony rain,</a>
<a id='line_12086'>  And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.</a>
<a id='line_12087'></a>
<a id='line_12088'>  Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend</a>
<a id='line_12089'>  To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:</a>
<a id='line_12090'>  Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,</a>
<a id='line_12091'>  Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field;</a>
<a id='line_12092'>  For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame</a>
<a id='line_12093'>  His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.</a>
<a id='line_12094'>  In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,</a>
<a id='line_12095'>  And bears aloft his ample shield in air;</a>
<a id='line_12096'>  Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_12097'>  Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:</a>
<a id='line_12098'>  And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,</a>
<a id='line_12099'>  Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.</a>
<a id='line_12100'></a>
<a id='line_12101'>  So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow</a>
<a id='line_12102'>  Descends a lion on the flocks below;</a>
<a id='line_12103'>  So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,</a>
<a id='line_12104'>  In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:</a>
<a id='line_12105'>  In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,</a>
<a id='line_12106'>  And shepherds gall him with an iron war;</a>
<a id='line_12107'>  Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;</a>
<a id='line_12108'>  He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.</a>
<a id='line_12109'></a>
<a id='line_12110'>  Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows</a>
<a id='line_12111'>  With generous rage that drives him on the foes.</a>
<a id='line_12112'>  He views the towers, and meditates their fall,</a>
<a id='line_12113'>  To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;</a>
<a id='line_12114'>  Then casting on his friend an ardent look,</a>
<a id='line_12115'>  Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_12116'></a>
<a id='line_12117'>  "Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,(226)</a>
<a id='line_12118'>  Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,</a>
<a id='line_12119'>  Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,</a>
<a id='line_12120'>  And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,</a>
<a id='line_12121'>  Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_12122'>  Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?</a>
<a id='line_12123'>  Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,</a>
<a id='line_12124'>  Admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,</a>
<a id='line_12125'>  Unless great acts superior merit prove,</a>
<a id='line_12126'>  And vindicate the bounteous powers above?</a>
<a id='line_12127'>  'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;</a>
<a id='line_12128'>  The first in valour, as the first in place;</a>
<a id='line_12129'>  That when with wondering eyes our martial bands</a>
<a id='line_12130'>  Behold our deeds transcending our commands,</a>
<a id='line_12131'>  Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,</a>
<a id='line_12132'>  Whom those that envy dare not imitate!</a>
<a id='line_12133'>  Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,</a>
<a id='line_12134'>  Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,</a>
<a id='line_12135'>  For lust of fame I should not vainly dare</a>
<a id='line_12136'>  In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.</a>
<a id='line_12137'>  But since, alas! ignoble age must come,</a>
<a id='line_12138'>  Disease, and death's inexorable doom</a>
<a id='line_12139'>  The life, which others pay, let us bestow,</a>
<a id='line_12140'>  And give to fame what we to nature owe;</a>
<a id='line_12141'>  Brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,</a>
<a id='line_12142'>  Or let us glory gain, or glory give!"</a>
<a id='line_12143'></a>
<a id='line_12144'>  He said; his words the listening chief inspire</a>
<a id='line_12145'>  With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;</a>
<a id='line_12146'>  The troops pursue their leaders with delight,</a>
<a id='line_12147'>  Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.</a>
<a id='line_12148'>  Menestheus from on high the storm beheld</a>
<a id='line_12149'>  Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:</a>
<a id='line_12150'>  Around the walls he gazed, to view from far</a>
<a id='line_12151'>  What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,</a>
<a id='line_12152'>  And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,</a>
<a id='line_12153'>  Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.</a>
<a id='line_12154'>  In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields</a>
<a id='line_12155'>  Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,</a>
<a id='line_12156'>  The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,</a>
<a id='line_12157'>  Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground</a>
<a id='line_12158'>  Then thus to Thoos: "Hence with speed (he said),</a>
<a id='line_12159'>  And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;</a>
<a id='line_12160'>  Their strength, united, best may help to bear</a>
<a id='line_12161'>  The bloody labours of the doubtful war:</a>

<a id='line_12168'></a>
<a id='line_12169'>  Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along</a>
<a id='line_12170'>  The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,</a>
<a id='line_12171'>  And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,</a>
<a id='line_12172'>  Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.</a>
<a id='line_12173'>  "Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!</a>

<a id='line_12183'></a>
<a id='line_12184'>  Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,</a>
<a id='line_12185'>  And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:</a>
<a id='line_12186'>  "Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,</a>

<a id='line_12192'>  With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,</a>
<a id='line_12193'>  Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.</a>
<a id='line_12194'></a>
<a id='line_12195'>  High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,</a>
<a id='line_12196'>  Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:</a>
<a id='line_12197'>  The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,</a>
<a id='line_12198'>  Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:</a>
<a id='line_12199'>  The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;</a>
<a id='line_12200'>  Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_12201'>  Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,</a>
<a id='line_12202'>  And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,</a>
<a id='line_12203'>  Sarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,</a>
<a id='line_12204'>  Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;</a>
<a id='line_12205'>  In modern ages not the strongest swain</a>
<a id='line_12206'>  Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:</a>
<a id='line_12207'>  He poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,</a>
<a id='line_12208'>  It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;</a>
<a id='line_12209'>  Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,</a>
<a id='line_12210'>  The ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.</a>
<a id='line_12211'>  As skilful divers from some airy steep</a>

<a id='line_12215'></a>
<a id='line_12216'>  While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,</a>
<a id='line_12217'>  From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;</a>

<a id='line_12221'>  Might stop the progress of his warlike host,</a>

<a id='line_12236'>  Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:</a>
<a id='line_12237'>  It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;</a>
<a id='line_12238'>  The rolling ruins smoke along the field.</a>
<a id='line_12239'>  A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;</a>
<a id='line_12240'>  And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.</a>

<a id='line_12249'>  Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,</a>

<a id='line_12269'>  Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.</a>
<a id='line_12270'>  Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,</a>
<a id='line_12271'>  Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;</a>
<a id='line_12272'>  The copious slaughter covers all the shore,</a>
<a id='line_12273'>  And the high ramparts drip with human gore.</a>
<a id='line_12274'></a>
<a id='line_12275'>  As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,</a>
<a id='line_12276'>  From side to side the trembling balance nods,</a>
<a id='line_12277'>  (While some laborious matron, just and poor,</a>

<a id='line_12280'>  Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:(227)</a>
<a id='line_12281'>  So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,</a>
<a id='line_12282'>  With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.</a>
<a id='line_12283'>  Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,</a>
<a id='line_12284'>  And fires his host with loud repeated cries.</a>
<a id='line_12285'>  "Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,</a>
<a id='line_12286'>  Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!"</a>
<a id='line_12287'>  They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,</a>
<a id='line_12288'>  Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:</a>
<a id='line_12289'>  Around the works a wood of glittering spears</a>
<a id='line_12290'>  Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.</a>
<a id='line_12291'>  A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,</a>
<a id='line_12292'>  Pointed above, and rough and gross below:</a>
<a id='line_12293'>  Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,</a>
<a id='line_12294'>  Such men as live in these degenerate days:</a>
<a id='line_12295'>  Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear</a>
<a id='line_12296'>  The snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;</a>
<a id='line_12297'>  For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load</a>
<a id='line_12298'>  The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.</a>
<a id='line_12299'>  Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,</a>
<a id='line_12300'>  Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;</a>
<a id='line_12301'>  With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,</a>
<a id='line_12302'>  On lofty beams of solid timber hung:</a>
<a id='line_12303'>  Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,</a>
<a id='line_12304'>  Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,</a>
<a id='line_12305'>  The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door</a>
<a id='line_12306'>  Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.</a>
<a id='line_12307'>  Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,</a>
<a id='line_12308'>  Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:(228)</a>
<a id='line_12309'>  A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,</a>
<a id='line_12310'>  And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.</a>
<a id='line_12311'>  He moves a god, resistless in his course,</a>
<a id='line_12312'>  And seems a match for more than mortal force.</a>
<a id='line_12313'>  Then pouring after, through the gaping space,</a>
<a id='line_12314'>  A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;</a>
<a id='line_12315'>  The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;</a>

<a id='line_12331'>THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE ACTS</a>
<a id='line_12332'>OF IDOMENEUS.</a>
<a id='line_12333'></a>
<a id='line_12334'>Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the</a>
<a id='line_12335'>fortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the station</a>
<a id='line_12336'>of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires those heroes to</a>
<a id='line_12337'>oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals, encourages the other</a>
<a id='line_12338'>Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The Ajaces form their troops in a</a>
<a id='line_12339'>close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans. Several deeds of</a>
<a id='line_12340'>valour are performed; Meriones, losing his spear in the encounter, repairs</a>
<a id='line_12341'>to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation</a>
<a id='line_12342'>between those two warriors, who return together to the battle. Idomeneus</a>
<a id='line_12343'>signalizes his courage above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and</a>
<a id='line_12344'>Alcathous: Deiphobus and AEneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus</a>
<a id='line_12345'>retires. Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are</a>
<a id='line_12346'>repulsed on the left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the</a>
<a id='line_12347'>Ajaces, till, being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas</a>
<a id='line_12348'>advises to call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes</a>
<a id='line_12349'>first to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax</a>
<a id='line_12350'>again, and renews the attack.</a>
<a id='line_12351'></a>
<a id='line_12352'>The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the</a>
<a id='line_12353'>Grecian wall and the sea-shore.</a>
<a id='line_12354'></a>
<a id='line_12355'>  When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast</a>
<a id='line_12356'>  Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,</a>
<a id='line_12357'>  He left them to the fates, in bloody fray</a>
<a id='line_12358'>  To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.</a>

<a id='line_12367'>  Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene</a>
<a id='line_12368'>  Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:</a>
<a id='line_12369'>  No aid, he deems, to either host is given,</a>
<a id='line_12370'>  While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_12371'></a>
<a id='line_12372'>  Meantime the monarch of the watery main</a>
<a id='line_12373'>  Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.</a>

<a id='line_12375'>  Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,</a>

<a id='line_12381'>  Emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his Argives slain.</a>
<a id='line_12382'>  At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,</a>
<a id='line_12383'>  Prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along;</a>
<a id='line_12384'>  Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,</a>
<a id='line_12385'>  The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,</a>
<a id='line_12386'>  And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.</a>
<a id='line_12387'>  From realm to realm three ample strides he took,</a>
<a id='line_12388'>  And, at the fourth, the distant AEgae shook.</a>
<a id='line_12389'></a>
<a id='line_12390'>  Far in the bay his shining palace stands,</a>
<a id='line_12391'>  Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:</a>
<a id='line_12392'>  This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,</a>

<a id='line_12394'>  Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,</a>

<a id='line_12399'>  The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep</a>
<a id='line_12400'>  Gambol around him on the watery way,</a>
<a id='line_12401'>  And heavy whales in awkward measures play;</a>
<a id='line_12402'>  The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,</a>
<a id='line_12403'>  Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;</a>
<a id='line_12404'>  The parting waves before his coursers fly;</a>
<a id='line_12405'>  The wondering waters leave his axle dry.</a>
<a id='line_12406'></a>

<a id='line_12423'>  And in their hopes the fleets already flame.</a>
<a id='line_12424'></a>

<a id='line_12426'>  The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,</a>

<a id='line_12874'>  He spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.</a>
<a id='line_12875'>  This Asius view'd, unable to contain,</a>
<a id='line_12876'>  Before his chariot warring on the plain:</a>
<a id='line_12877'>  (His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,</a>

<a id='line_12879'>  To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,</a>

<a id='line_12881'>  The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,</a>
<a id='line_12882'>  Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:</a>
<a id='line_12883'>  Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,</a>
<a id='line_12884'>  And glitter'd, extant at the further side.</a>
<a id='line_12885'>  As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,</a>
<a id='line_12886'>  Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,</a>
<a id='line_12887'>  Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,</a>
<a id='line_12888'>  Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:</a>
<a id='line_12889'>  So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,</a>
<a id='line_12890'>  And stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.</a>
<a id='line_12891'>  He grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,</a>
<a id='line_12892'>  And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.</a>
<a id='line_12893'>  Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,</a>
<a id='line_12894'>  Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,</a>
<a id='line_12895'>  Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,</a>
<a id='line_12896'>  But falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:</a>
<a id='line_12897'>  Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath</a>
<a id='line_12898'>  The stately car, and labours out his breath.</a>
<a id='line_12899'>  Thus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)</a>
<a id='line_12900'>  Remain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.</a>
<a id='line_12901'></a>
<a id='line_12902'>  Stabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,</a>
<a id='line_12903'>  And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.</a>
<a id='line_12904'>  The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance</a>
<a id='line_12905'>  From his slope shield the disappointed lance.</a>
<a id='line_12906'>  Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,</a>

<a id='line_12989'></a>
<a id='line_12990'>  AEneas heard, and for a space resign'd</a>
<a id='line_12991'>  To tender pity all his manly mind;</a>
<a id='line_12992'>  Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:</a>
<a id='line_12993'>  The Greek awaits him with collected might.</a>
<a id='line_12994'>  As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,</a>
<a id='line_12995'>  Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,</a>

<a id='line_12998'>  O'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;</a>
<a id='line_12999'>  Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_13000'>  His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;</a>
<a id='line_13001'>  But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:</a>
<a id='line_13002'>  So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,</a>
<a id='line_13003'>  And met the Trojan with a lowering look.</a>
<a id='line_13004'>  Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,</a>
<a id='line_13005'>  The youthful offspring of the god of war,</a>
<a id='line_13006'>  Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:</a>

<a id='line_13018'>  Th' assisting forces of his native bands;</a>
<a id='line_13019'>  Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;</a>
<a id='line_13020'>  (Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)</a>

<a id='line_13026'>  To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:</a>
<a id='line_13027'>  So joys AEneas, as his native band</a>

<a id='line_13032'>  Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,</a>
<a id='line_13033'>  And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.</a>
<a id='line_13034'>  Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,</a>
<a id='line_13035'>  There great Idomeneus, AEneas here.</a>
<a id='line_13036'>  Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,</a>
<a id='line_13037'>  And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.</a>
<a id='line_13038'>  The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;</a>
<a id='line_13039'>  The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:</a>
<a id='line_13040'>  Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood</a>
<a id='line_13041'>  Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.</a>
<a id='line_13042'>  But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;</a>
<a id='line_13043'>  The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,</a>
<a id='line_13044'>  It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,</a>
<a id='line_13045'>  And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_13046'>  Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,</a>
<a id='line_13047'>  And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.</a>
<a id='line_13048'>  The victor from his breast the weapon tears;</a>
<a id='line_13049'>  His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.</a>
<a id='line_13050'>  Though now unfit an active war to wage,</a>
<a id='line_13051'>  Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,</a>
<a id='line_13052'>  His listless limbs unable for the course,</a>
<a id='line_13053'>  In standing fight he yet maintains his force;</a>
<a id='line_13054'>  Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,</a>
<a id='line_13055'>  His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.</a>
<a id='line_13056'>  Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_13057'>  And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:</a>
<a id='line_13058'>  The javelin err'd, but held its course along,</a>
<a id='line_13059'>  And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:</a>
<a id='line_13060'>  The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_13061'>  And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.</a>
<a id='line_13062'></a>
<a id='line_13063'>  Nor knew the furious father of his fall;</a>
<a id='line_13064'>  High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,</a>
<a id='line_13065'>  On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;</a>
<a id='line_13066'>  Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.</a>
<a id='line_13067'></a>
<a id='line_13068'>  Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,</a>
<a id='line_13069'>  For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,</a>
<a id='line_13070'>  Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,</a>
<a id='line_13071'>  And from his temples rends the glittering prize;</a>
<a id='line_13072'>  Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,</a>
<a id='line_13073'>  And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:</a>
<a id='line_13074'>  He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;</a>
<a id='line_13075'>  The hollow helmet rings against the plain.</a>
<a id='line_13076'>  Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,</a>
<a id='line_13077'>  From his torn arm the Grecian rent away</a>
<a id='line_13078'>  The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.</a>
<a id='line_13079'>  His wounded brother good Polites tends;</a>
<a id='line_13080'>  Around his waist his pious arms he threw,</a>
<a id='line_13081'>  And from the rage of battle gently drew:</a>
<a id='line_13082'>  Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,</a>
<a id='line_13083'>  Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;</a>
<a id='line_13084'>  To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,</a>
<a id='line_13085'>  And sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.</a>
<a id='line_13086'></a>
<a id='line_13087'>  Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,</a>
<a id='line_13088'>  Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.</a>
<a id='line_13089'>  Bold Aphareus by great AEneas bled;</a>
<a id='line_13090'>  As toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,</a>
<a id='line_13091'>  He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd</a>
<a id='line_13092'>  Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;</a>
<a id='line_13093'>  His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,</a>
<a id='line_13094'>  And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_13095'>  Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,</a>
<a id='line_13096'>  Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:</a>
<a id='line_13097'>  The hollow vein, that to the neck extends</a>
<a id='line_13098'>  Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:</a>
<a id='line_13099'>  Supine he falls, and to his social train</a>
<a id='line_13100'>  Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.</a>
<a id='line_13101'>  Th' exulting victor, leaping where he lay,</a>
<a id='line_13102'>  From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;</a>
<a id='line_13103'>  His time observed; for closed by foes around,</a>
<a id='line_13104'>  On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.</a>
<a id='line_13105'>  His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,</a>
<a id='line_13106'>  But he impervious and untouch'd remains.</a>
<a id='line_13107'>  (Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage</a>
<a id='line_13108'>  This youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)</a>
<a id='line_13109'>  In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,</a>
<a id='line_13110'>  Faced every foe, and every danger sought;</a>
<a id='line_13111'>  His winged lance, resistless as the wind,</a>
<a id='line_13112'>  Obeys each motion of the master's mind!</a>
<a id='line_13113'>  Restless it flies, impatient to be free,</a>
<a id='line_13114'>  And meditates the distant enemy.</a>
<a id='line_13115'>  The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,</a>
<a id='line_13116'>  And struck his target with the brazen spear</a>
<a id='line_13117'>  Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,</a>
<a id='line_13118'>  And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:</a>
<a id='line_13119'>  In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,</a>
<a id='line_13120'>  Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.</a>
<a id='line_13121'>  Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;</a>
<a id='line_13122'>  But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,</a>
<a id='line_13123'>  Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,</a>
<a id='line_13124'>  Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.</a>
<a id='line_13125'>  Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,</a>
<a id='line_13126'>  Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,</a>
<a id='line_13127'>  While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,</a>
<a id='line_13128'>  His bulk enormous on the field displays;</a>
<a id='line_13129'>  His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.</a>
<a id='line_13130'>  The spear the conqueror from his body drew,</a>
<a id='line_13131'>  And death's dim shadows swarm before his view.</a>
<a id='line_13132'>  Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:</a>
<a id='line_13133'>  King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,</a>
<a id='line_13134'>  And smote his temples with an arm so strong,</a>
<a id='line_13135'>  The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:</a>
<a id='line_13136'>  There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;</a>
<a id='line_13137'>  For dark in death the godlike owner lies!</a>
<a id='line_13138'>  Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,</a>
<a id='line_13139'>  And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:</a>
<a id='line_13140'>  That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;</a>
<a id='line_13141'>  And this stood adverse with the bended bow:</a>
<a id='line_13142'>  Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,</a>
<a id='line_13143'>  But harmless bounded from the plated steel.</a>
<a id='line_13144'>  As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,</a>
<a id='line_13145'>  (The winds collected at each open door,)</a>

<a id='line_13150'>  Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,</a>
<a id='line_13151'>  Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.</a>
<a id='line_13152'>  And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand</a>

<a id='line_13465'>  They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:</a>
<a id='line_13466'></a>
<a id='line_13467'>  "From whence this menace, this insulting strain?</a>
<a id='line_13468'>  Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.</a>
<a id='line_13469'>  So may the gods on Hector life bestow,</a>
<a id='line_13470'>  (Not that short life which mortals lead below,</a>
<a id='line_13471'>  But such as those of Jove's high lineage born,</a>
<a id='line_13472'>  The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)</a>
<a id='line_13473'>  As this decisive day shall end the fame</a>
<a id='line_13474'>  Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.</a>
<a id='line_13475'>  And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait</a>
<a id='line_13476'>  The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:</a>

<a id='line_13478'>  Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore."</a>
<a id='line_13479'></a>
<a id='line_13480'>  He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:</a>
<a id='line_13481'>  With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,</a>
<a id='line_13482'>  Sent from his following host: the Grecian train</a>
<a id='line_13483'>  With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;</a>

<a id='line_13499'></a>
<a id='line_13500'>JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.</a>
<a id='line_13501'></a>
<a id='line_13502'>Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing</a>
<a id='line_13503'>clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he meets that prince</a>
<a id='line_13504'>with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the extremity of the danger.</a>
<a id='line_13505'>Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, which Ulysses</a>
<a id='line_13506'>withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, wounded as they were,</a>
<a id='line_13507'>they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, which</a>
<a id='line_13508'>advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans,</a>
<a id='line_13509'>forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off her charms with the utmost</a>
<a id='line_13510'>care, and (the more surely to enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of</a>
<a id='line_13511'>Venus. She then applies herself to the god of sleep, and, with some</a>
<a id='line_13512'>difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter: this done, she goes</a>
<a id='line_13513'>to mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her beauty,</a>
<a id='line_13514'>sinks in her embraces, and is laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his</a>
<a id='line_13515'>slumber, and succours the Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a</a>
<a id='line_13516'>prodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions</a>
<a id='line_13517'>succeed, till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the</a>
<a id='line_13518'>lesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner.</a>
<a id='line_13519'></a>
<a id='line_13520'>  But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,</a>
<a id='line_13521'>  Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;</a>
<a id='line_13522'>  His startled ears the increasing cries attend;</a>
<a id='line_13523'>  Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:</a>
<a id='line_13524'></a>
<a id='line_13525'>  "What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,</a>
<a id='line_13526'>  What mix'd events attend this mighty day?</a>
<a id='line_13527'>  Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,</a>
<a id='line_13528'>  And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!</a>
<a id='line_13529'>  Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,</a>
<a id='line_13530'>  Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,</a>
<a id='line_13531'>  Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;</a>
<a id='line_13532'>  While I the adventures of the day explore."</a>
<a id='line_13533'></a>
<a id='line_13534'>  He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,</a>
<a id='line_13535'>  (His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;</a>
<a id='line_13536'>  (That day the son his father's buckler bore;)</a>
<a id='line_13537'>  Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.</a>
<a id='line_13538'>  Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,</a>
<a id='line_13539'>  His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;</a>
<a id='line_13540'>  Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,</a>
<a id='line_13541'>  The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.</a>
<a id='line_13542'>  As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,</a>
<a id='line_13543'>  The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:</a>
<a id='line_13544'>  While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,</a>
<a id='line_13545'>  Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,</a>
<a id='line_13546'>  The mass of waters will no wind obey;</a>
<a id='line_13547'>  Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.</a>
<a id='line_13548'>  While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,</a>
<a id='line_13549'>  Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,</a>
<a id='line_13550'>  To join the host, or to the general haste;</a>
<a id='line_13551'>  Debating long, he fixes on the last:</a>
<a id='line_13552'>  Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,</a>
<a id='line_13553'>  The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,</a>
<a id='line_13554'>  The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;</a>
<a id='line_13555'>  Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.</a>
<a id='line_13556'></a>
<a id='line_13557'>  Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,</a>
<a id='line_13558'>  By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:</a>
<a id='line_13559'>  The king of men, Ulysses the divine,</a>
<a id='line_13560'>  And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.(232)</a>
<a id='line_13561'>  (Their ships at distance from the battle stand,</a>
<a id='line_13562'>  In lines advanced along the shelving strand:</a>
<a id='line_13563'>  Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain</a>
<a id='line_13564'>  At length; beside the margin of the main,</a>
<a id='line_13565'>  Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:</a>
<a id='line_13566'>  Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)</a>
<a id='line_13567'>  Supported on the spears, they took their way,</a>
<a id='line_13568'>  Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.</a>
<a id='line_13569'>  Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,</a>
<a id='line_13570'>  Whom thus the general of the host address'd:</a>
<a id='line_13571'></a>
<a id='line_13572'>  "O grace and glory of the Achaian name;</a>
<a id='line_13573'>  What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?</a>
<a id='line_13574'>  Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,</a>
<a id='line_13575'>  Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?</a>
<a id='line_13576'>  Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,</a>
<a id='line_13577'>  On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.</a>
<a id='line_13578'>  Is every heart inflamed with equal rage</a>
<a id='line_13579'>  Against your king, nor will one chief engage?</a>
<a id='line_13580'>  And have I lived to see with mournful eyes</a>
<a id='line_13581'>  In every Greek a new Achilles rise?"</a>
<a id='line_13582'></a>
<a id='line_13583'>  Gerenian Nestor then: "So fate has will'd;</a>
<a id='line_13584'>  And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.</a>
<a id='line_13585'>  Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,</a>
<a id='line_13586'>  Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.</a>
<a id='line_13587'>  The wall, our late inviolable bound,</a>
<a id='line_13588'>  And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:</a>
<a id='line_13589'>  Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,</a>
<a id='line_13590'>  And groans of slaughter'd Greeks to heaven ascend.</a>
<a id='line_13591'>  On speedy measures then employ your thought</a>
<a id='line_13592'>  In such distress! if counsel profit aught:</a>
<a id='line_13593'>  Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,</a>
<a id='line_13594'>  These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight."</a>
<a id='line_13595'></a>
<a id='line_13596'>  To him the monarch: "That our army bends,</a>
<a id='line_13597'>  That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,</a>
<a id='line_13598'>  And that the rampart, late our surest trust</a>
<a id='line_13599'>  And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;</a>
<a id='line_13600'>  All this from Jove's afflictive hand we bear,</a>
<a id='line_13601'>  Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.</a>
<a id='line_13602'>  Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,</a>
<a id='line_13603'>  And all his favour, all his aid confess'd;</a>
<a id='line_13604'>  Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,</a>
<a id='line_13605'>  And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_13606'>  Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,</a>
<a id='line_13607'>  And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;</a>
<a id='line_13608'>  Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:</a>
<a id='line_13609'>  Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,</a>
<a id='line_13610'>  Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.</a>
<a id='line_13611'>  Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,</a>
<a id='line_13612'>  Than perish in the danger we may shun."</a>
<a id='line_13613'></a>
<a id='line_13614'>  Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,</a>
<a id='line_13615'>  While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes:</a>
<a id='line_13616'>  "What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)</a>
<a id='line_13617'>  Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?</a>
<a id='line_13618'>  Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,</a>
<a id='line_13619'>  And thou the shame of any host but ours!</a>
<a id='line_13620'>  A host, by Jove endued with martial might,</a>
<a id='line_13621'>  And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:</a>
<a id='line_13622'>  Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,</a>
<a id='line_13623'>  Employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.</a>
<a id='line_13624'>  And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?</a>
<a id='line_13625'>  And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?</a>
<a id='line_13626'>  In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,</a>
<a id='line_13627'>  Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.</a>
<a id='line_13628'>  Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares</a>
<a id='line_13629'>  To think such meanness, or the thought declares?</a>
<a id='line_13630'>  And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway</a>
<a id='line_13631'>  The banded legions of all Greece obey?</a>
<a id='line_13632'>  Is this a general's voice that calls to flight,</a>
<a id='line_13633'>  While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?</a>
<a id='line_13634'>  What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies</a>
<a id='line_13635'>  Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.</a>
<a id='line_13636'>  No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,</a>
<a id='line_13637'>  Themselves abandon'd) shall the fight pursue;</a>
<a id='line_13638'>  But thy ships flying, with despair shall see;</a>
<a id='line_13639'>  And owe destruction to a prince like thee."</a>
<a id='line_13640'></a>
<a id='line_13641'>  "Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)</a>
<a id='line_13642'>  Like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.</a>
<a id='line_13643'>  Unwilling as I am to lose the host,</a>
<a id='line_13644'>  I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;</a>
<a id='line_13645'>  Glad I submit, whoe'er, or young, or old,</a>
<a id='line_13646'>  Aught, more conducive to our weal, unfold."</a>
<a id='line_13647'></a>
<a id='line_13648'>  Tydides cut him short, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_13649'>  "Such counsel if you seek, behold the man</a>
<a id='line_13650'>  Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,</a>
<a id='line_13651'>  Young though he be, disdain not to obey:</a>
<a id='line_13652'>  A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,</a>

<a id='line_13657'>  Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.</a>

<a id='line_13660'>  Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass'd</a>
<a id='line_13661'>  The rest in courage) OEneus was the last.</a>
<a id='line_13662'>  From him, my sire. From Calydon expell'd,</a>
<a id='line_13663'>  He pass'd to Argos, and in exile dwell'd;</a>
<a id='line_13664'>  The monarch's daughter there (so Jove ordain'd)</a>
<a id='line_13665'>  He won, and flourish'd where Adrastus reign'd;</a>
<a id='line_13666'>  There, rich in fortune's gifts, his acres till'd,</a>
<a id='line_13667'>  Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,</a>
<a id='line_13668'>  And numerous flocks that whiten'd all the field.</a>
<a id='line_13669'>  Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!</a>
<a id='line_13670'>  Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.</a>
<a id='line_13671'>  Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,</a>
<a id='line_13672'>  Attend, and in the son respect the sire.</a>
<a id='line_13673'>  Though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_13674'>  Let each go forth, and animate the rest,</a>

<a id='line_13677'>  But lest new wounds on wounds o'erpower us quite,</a>
<a id='line_13678'>  Beyond the missile javelin's sounding flight,</a>
<a id='line_13679'>  Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,</a>
<a id='line_13680'>  Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war."</a>
<a id='line_13681'></a>
<a id='line_13682'>  He added not: the listening kings obey,</a>
<a id='line_13683'>  Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.</a>
<a id='line_13684'>  The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)</a>
<a id='line_13685'>  Appears a warrior furrowed o'er with age;</a>
<a id='line_13686'>  Press'd in his own, the general's hand he took,</a>
<a id='line_13687'>  And thus the venerable hero spoke:</a>

<a id='line_13691'>  Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,</a>
<a id='line_13692'>  Who glories in unutterable pride.</a>

<a id='line_13700'>  To hide their ignominious heads in Troy."</a>
<a id='line_13701'></a>
<a id='line_13702'>  He spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew,</a>
<a id='line_13703'>  And sent his voice before him as he flew,</a>
<a id='line_13704'>  Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield</a>
<a id='line_13705'>  When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;</a>

<a id='line_13708'>  Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,</a>
<a id='line_13709'>  And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.</a>

<a id='line_14210'>THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.</a>
<a id='line_14211'></a>
<a id='line_14212'>Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector in a</a>
<a id='line_14213'>swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highly incensed at the</a>
<a id='line_14214'>artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions; she is then sent to</a>
<a id='line_14215'>Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of the gods, attempts,</a>
<a id='line_14216'>with extraordinary address, to incense them against Jupiter; in particular</a>
<a id='line_14217'>she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but</a>
<a id='line_14218'>is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris</a>
<a id='line_14219'>commands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and</a>
<a id='line_14220'>passion, he consents. Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him</a>
<a id='line_14221'>back to the battle, marches before him with his aegis, and turns the</a>
<a id='line_14222'>fortune of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the</a>
<a id='line_14223'>Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are,</a>
<a id='line_14224'>as yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_14225'></a>
<a id='line_14226'>  Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,</a>
<a id='line_14227'>  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:</a>
<a id='line_14228'>  Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie</a>
<a id='line_14229'>  Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.</a>
<a id='line_14230'>  Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,</a>
<a id='line_14231'>  On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:</a>
<a id='line_14232'>  Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,</a>
<a id='line_14233'>  There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;</a>
<a id='line_14234'>  These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain</a>
<a id='line_14235'>  And, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.</a>
<a id='line_14236'>  Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,</a>
<a id='line_14237'>  (His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)</a>
<a id='line_14238'>  Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,</a>
<a id='line_14239'>  His senses wandering to the verge of death.</a>
<a id='line_14240'>  The god beheld him with a pitying look,</a>
<a id='line_14241'>  And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:</a>
<a id='line_14242'></a>
<a id='line_14243'>  "O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,</a>
<a id='line_14244'>  For ever studious in promoting ill!</a>

<a id='line_14264'>  Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love."</a>
<a id='line_14265'></a>
<a id='line_14266'>  The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd,</a>
<a id='line_14267'>  And, trembling, these submissive words return'd:</a>

<a id='line_14808'>  Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head</a>
<a id='line_14809'>  Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.</a>
<a id='line_14810'>  The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries;</a>
<a id='line_14811'>  "Some god prevents our destined enterprise:</a>

<a id='line_14816'></a>
<a id='line_14817'>  "Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)</a>

<a id='line_14827'></a>
<a id='line_14828'>  Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;</a>

<a id='line_14855'></a>
<a id='line_14856'>  This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:</a>

<a id='line_14862'>  Yet undetermined, or to live or die?</a>
<a id='line_14863'>  What hopes remain, what methods to retire,</a>
<a id='line_14864'>  If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?</a>

<a id='line_14867'>  Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,</a>
<a id='line_14868'>  It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.</a>
<a id='line_14869'>  'Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;</a>
<a id='line_14870'>  To your own hands are trusted all your fates;</a>
<a id='line_14871'>  And better far in one decisive strife,</a>
<a id='line_14872'>  One day should end our labour or our life,</a>

<a id='line_14973'>  Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_14974'>  So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,</a>
<a id='line_14975'>  Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,</a>
<a id='line_14976'>  While conscious of the deed, he glares around,</a>
<a id='line_14977'>  And hears the gathering multitude resound,</a>
<a id='line_14978'>  Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,</a>
<a id='line_14979'>  And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:</a>
<a id='line_14980'>  So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,</a>
<a id='line_14981'>  While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;</a>
<a id='line_14982'>  But enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns</a>
<a id='line_14983'>  His manly breast, and with new fury burns.</a>
<a id='line_14984'></a>
<a id='line_14985'>  Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,</a>
<a id='line_14986'>  Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:</a>
<a id='line_14987'>  The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,</a>
<a id='line_14988'>  The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;</a>
<a id='line_14989'>  But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,</a>
<a id='line_14990'>  Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.</a>
<a id='line_14991'>  On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,</a>
<a id='line_14992'>  To view the navy blazing to the skies;</a>
<a id='line_14993'>  Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,</a>
<a id='line_14994'>  The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.</a>
<a id='line_14995'>  These fates revolved in his almighty mind,</a>
<a id='line_14996'>  He raises Hector to the work design'd,</a>
<a id='line_14997'>  Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,</a>
<a id='line_14998'>  And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.</a>
<a id='line_14999'>  So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,</a>
<a id='line_15000'>  Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.</a>
<a id='line_15001'>  Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,</a>
<a id='line_15002'>  Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.</a>
<a id='line_15003'>  He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow</a>
<a id='line_15004'>  Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:</a>
<a id='line_15005'>  The radiant helmet on his temple burns,</a>
<a id='line_15006'>  Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:</a>
<a id='line_15007'>  For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,</a>
<a id='line_15008'>  And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.</a>
<a id='line_15009'>  Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,</a>
<a id='line_15010'>  Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:</a>
<a id='line_15011'>  Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,</a>
<a id='line_15012'>  And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!</a>
<a id='line_15013'></a>
<a id='line_15014'>  Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes</a>
<a id='line_15015'>  Burn at each foe, and single every prize;</a>
<a id='line_15016'>  Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,</a>
<a id='line_15017'>  He points his ardour, and exerts his might.</a>
<a id='line_15018'>  The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,</a>
<a id='line_15019'>  On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:</a>
<a id='line_15020'>  So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,(241)</a>
<a id='line_15021'>  By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,</a>
<a id='line_15022'>  Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,</a>
<a id='line_15023'>  And sees the watery mountains break below.</a>
<a id='line_15024'>  Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall</a>
<a id='line_15025'>  Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:</a>
<a id='line_15026'>  Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,</a>
<a id='line_15027'>  And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;</a>
<a id='line_15028'>  White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud</a>
<a id='line_15029'>  Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:</a>
<a id='line_15030'>  Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;</a>
<a id='line_15031'>  And instant death on every wave appears.</a>
<a id='line_15032'>  So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,</a>
<a id='line_15033'>  The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.</a>
<a id='line_15034'></a>
<a id='line_15035'>  As when a lion, rushing from his den,</a>
<a id='line_15036'>  Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,</a>
<a id='line_15037'>  (Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,</a>
<a id='line_15038'>  At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)</a>
<a id='line_15039'>  Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;</a>
<a id='line_15040'>  The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;</a>
<a id='line_15041'>  Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)</a>
<a id='line_15042'>  He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.</a>
<a id='line_15043'>  Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew</a>
<a id='line_15044'>  All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:</a>
<a id='line_15045'>  Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,</a>
<a id='line_15046'>  In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;</a>
<a id='line_15047'>  The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire</a>
<a id='line_15048'>  Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:</a>
<a id='line_15049'>  The son redeem'd the honours of the race,</a>
<a id='line_15050'>  A son as generous as the sire was base;</a>
<a id='line_15051'>  O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far</a>
<a id='line_15052'>  In every virtue, or of peace or war:</a>
<a id='line_15053'>  But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!</a>
<a id='line_15054'>  Against the margin of his ample shield</a>
<a id='line_15055'>  He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;</a>
<a id='line_15056'>  Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.</a>
<a id='line_15057'>  On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,</a>
<a id='line_15058'>  And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.</a>
<a id='line_15059'>  His circling friends, who strove to guard too late</a>
<a id='line_15060'>  The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.</a>
<a id='line_15061'></a>
<a id='line_15062'>  Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train</a>
<a id='line_15063'>  Now man the next, receding toward the main:</a>
<a id='line_15064'>  Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,</a>
<a id='line_15065'>  Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.</a>
<a id='line_15066'>  Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;</a>
<a id='line_15067'>  Now fear itself confines them to the fight:</a>
<a id='line_15068'>  Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most</a>
<a id='line_15069'>  (The sage preserver of the Grecian host)</a>
<a id='line_15070'>  Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;</a>
<a id='line_15071'>  And by their parents, by themselves implores.</a>
<a id='line_15072'></a>
<a id='line_15073'>  "Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame</a>
<a id='line_15074'>  With mutual honour, and with mutual shame!</a>
<a id='line_15075'>  Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care</a>

<a id='line_15082'>  And all are lost, if you desert the day."</a>
<a id='line_15083'></a>
<a id='line_15084'>  He spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;</a>
<a id='line_15085'>  Minerva seconds what the sage inspires.</a>
<a id='line_15086'>  The mist of darkness Jove around them threw</a>
<a id='line_15087'>  She clear'd, restoring all the war to view;</a>
<a id='line_15088'>  A sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain,</a>
<a id='line_15089'>  And show'd the shores, the navy, and the main:</a>
<a id='line_15090'>  Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,</a>
<a id='line_15091'>  The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,</a>
<a id='line_15092'>  First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_15093'>  His port majestic, and his ample size:</a>
<a id='line_15094'>  A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_15095'>  Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;</a>
<a id='line_15096'>  Nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands</a>
<a id='line_15097'>  But looks a moving tower above the bands;</a>
<a id='line_15098'>  High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,</a>
<a id='line_15099'>  The godlike hero stalks from side to side.</a>
<a id='line_15100'>  So when a horseman from the watery mead</a>
<a id='line_15101'>  (Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed)</a>
<a id='line_15102'>  Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,</a>

<a id='line_15104'>  Safe in his art, as side by side they run,</a>
<a id='line_15105'>  He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;</a>
<a id='line_15106'>  And now to this, and now to that he flies;</a>
<a id='line_15107'>  Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_15108'></a>
<a id='line_15109'>  From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,</a>
<a id='line_15110'>  No less the wonder of the warring crew.</a>
<a id='line_15111'>  As furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud,</a>
<a id='line_15112'>  And rush'd enraged before the Trojan crowd;</a>
<a id='line_15113'>  Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores</a>
<a id='line_15114'>  Lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores;</a>
<a id='line_15115'>  So the strong eagle from his airy height,</a>
<a id='line_15116'>  Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,</a>
<a id='line_15117'>  Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,</a>
<a id='line_15118'>  And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.</a>
<a id='line_15119'>  Jove leads him on with his almighty hand,</a>
<a id='line_15120'>  And breathes fierce spirits in his following band.</a>
<a id='line_15121'>  The warring nations meet, the battle roars,</a>
<a id='line_15122'>  Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.</a>
<a id='line_15123'>  Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,</a>
<a id='line_15124'>  No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;</a>
<a id='line_15125'>  As if new vigour from new fights they won,</a>
<a id='line_15126'>  And the long battle was but then begun.</a>
<a id='line_15127'>  Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,</a>
<a id='line_15128'>  Secure of death, confiding in despair:</a>
<a id='line_15129'>  Troy in proud hopes already view'd the main</a>
<a id='line_15130'>  Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:</a>
<a id='line_15131'>  Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,</a>
<a id='line_15132'>  And each contends, as his were all the war.</a>
<a id='line_15133'></a>
<a id='line_15134'>  "Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand</a>
<a id='line_15135'>  First seized a ship on that contested strand;</a>

<a id='line_15137'>  The first that touch'd the unhappy Trojan shore:</a>
<a id='line_15138'>  For this in arms the warring nations stood,</a>
<a id='line_15139'>  And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.</a>
<a id='line_15140'>  No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;</a>
<a id='line_15141'>  But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:</a>
<a id='line_15142'>  Wounded, they wound; and seek each other's hearts</a>
<a id='line_15143'>  With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts.</a>
<a id='line_15144'>  The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,</a>
<a id='line_15145'>  Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_15146'>  With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,</a>
<a id='line_15147'>  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.</a>
<a id='line_15148'></a>
<a id='line_15149'>  Still raging, Hector with his ample hand</a>
<a id='line_15150'>  Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:</a>

<a id='line_15216'>Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)</a>
<a id='line_15217'>entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with</a>
<a id='line_15218'>Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time charges</a>
<a id='line_15219'>him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of</a>
<a id='line_15220'>the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described.</a>
<a id='line_15221'>Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend, after which</a>
<a id='line_15222'>Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight of</a>
<a id='line_15223'>Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the</a>
<a id='line_15224'>uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector</a>
<a id='line_15225'>himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate.</a>
<a id='line_15226'>Several other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of</a>
<a id='line_15227'>which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to</a>
<a id='line_15228'>the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds</a>
<a id='line_15229'>him, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book.</a>

<a id='line_15231'>  So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,</a>

<a id='line_15573'>  And waits the combat with impatient eyes.</a>
<a id='line_15574'></a>
<a id='line_15575'>  Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care,</a>
<a id='line_15576'>  Invade the Trojans, and commence the war.</a>
<a id='line_15577'>  As wasps, provoked by children in their play,</a>
<a id='line_15578'>  Pour from their mansions by the broad highway,</a>
<a id='line_15579'>  In swarms the guiltless traveller engage,</a>
<a id='line_15580'>  Whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:</a>
<a id='line_15581'>  All rise in arms, and, with a general cry,</a>
<a id='line_15582'>  Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.</a>
<a id='line_15583'>  Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,</a>
<a id='line_15584'>  So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:</a>
<a id='line_15585'>  Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires,</a>
<a id='line_15586'>  Who thus inflames them with heroic fires:</a>
<a id='line_15587'></a>
<a id='line_15588'>  "O warriors, partners of Achilles' praise!</a>
<a id='line_15589'>  Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days;</a>
<a id='line_15590'>  Your godlike master let your acts proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_15591'>  And add new glories to his mighty name.</a>
<a id='line_15592'>  Think your Achilles sees you fight: be brave,</a>

<a id='line_15594'></a>
<a id='line_15595'>  Joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,</a>
<a id='line_15596'>  Flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.</a>
<a id='line_15597'>  From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,</a>
<a id='line_15598'>  The hollow ships return a deeper sound.</a>
<a id='line_15599'>  The war stood still, and all around them gazed,</a>
<a id='line_15600'>  When great Achilles' shining armour blazed:</a>
<a id='line_15601'>  Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh,</a>
<a id='line_15602'>  At once they see, they tremble, and they fly.</a>
<a id='line_15603'></a>
<a id='line_15604'>  Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew,</a>
<a id='line_15605'>  Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.</a>
<a id='line_15606'>  Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore</a>
<a id='line_15607'>  Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore,</a>
<a id='line_15608'>  The great Paeonian, bold Pyrechmes stood;</a>

<a id='line_15616'>  Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies;</a>
<a id='line_15617'>  In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;</a>
<a id='line_15618'>  Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,</a>
<a id='line_15619'>  And loud acclaim the starry region rends.</a>
<a id='line_15620'>  So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,</a>
<a id='line_15621'>  O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread;</a>
<a id='line_15622'>  Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,</a>

<a id='line_15626'>  The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,</a>
<a id='line_15627'>  And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.</a>
<a id='line_15628'></a>
<a id='line_15629'>  But Troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains,</a>
<a id='line_15630'>  Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.</a>
<a id='line_15631'>  Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,</a>

<a id='line_15633'>  As Areilycus had turn'd him round,</a>
<a id='line_15634'>  Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;</a>
<a id='line_15635'>  The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,</a>
<a id='line_15636'>  The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone:</a>
<a id='line_15637'>  Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;</a>

<a id='line_15875'>  Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,</a>
<a id='line_15876'>  Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)</a>
<a id='line_15877'>  Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound</a>
<a id='line_15878'>  It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_15879'>  Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,</a>
<a id='line_15880'>  Before his chariot stretch'd his form divine:</a>
<a id='line_15881'>  He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,</a>
<a id='line_15882'>  And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.</a>
<a id='line_15883'>  So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,</a>
<a id='line_15884'>  While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws</a>
<a id='line_15885'>  The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;</a>
<a id='line_15886'>  Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.</a>
<a id='line_15887'></a>
<a id='line_15888'>  Then to the leader of the Lycian band</a>

<a id='line_15896'>  What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,</a>
<a id='line_15897'>  If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!</a>
<a id='line_15898'>  Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;</a>
<a id='line_15899'>  Defend my body, conquer in my right:</a>
<a id='line_15900'>  That, taught by great examples, all may try</a>

<a id='line_15902'>  He ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,</a>
<a id='line_15903'>  And his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.</a>
<a id='line_15904'>  The insulting victor with disdain bestrode</a>
<a id='line_15905'>  The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;</a>
<a id='line_15906'>  Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,</a>
<a id='line_15907'>  The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;</a>
<a id='line_15908'>  From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,</a>
<a id='line_15909'>  And the soul issued in the purple flood.</a>
<a id='line_15910'>  His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,</a>
<a id='line_15911'>  Unguided now, their mighty master slain.</a>
<a id='line_15912'>  All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,</a>
<a id='line_15913'>  Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:</a>
<a id='line_15914'>  His painful arm, yet useless with the smart</a>
<a id='line_15915'>  Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,</a>
<a id='line_15916'>  Supported on his better hand he stay'd:</a>
<a id='line_15917'>  To Phoebus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_15918'></a>
<a id='line_15919'>  "All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,</a>

<a id='line_15932'>  To head my Lycians, and support the fight."</a>
<a id='line_15933'></a>
<a id='line_15934'>  Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,</a>
<a id='line_15935'>  His heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;</a>
<a id='line_15936'>  He drew the dolours from the wounded part,</a>

<a id='line_15940'>  First to the fight his native troops he warms,</a>
<a id='line_15941'>  Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;</a>

<a id='line_15946'></a>
<a id='line_15947'>  "What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?</a>
<a id='line_15948'>  Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!</a>

<a id='line_15959'></a>
<a id='line_15960'>  He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:</a>
<a id='line_15961'>  Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.</a>
<a id='line_15962'>  Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown</a>
<a id='line_15963'>  At once his country's pillar, and their own;</a>
<a id='line_15964'>  A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall</a>
<a id='line_15965'>  A host of heroes, and outshined them all.</a>
<a id='line_15966'>  Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,</a>
<a id='line_15967'>  And with superior vengeance greatly glows.</a>
<a id='line_15968'></a>
<a id='line_15969'>  But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,</a>
<a id='line_15970'>  And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:</a>

<a id='line_15985'>  With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;</a>
<a id='line_15986'>  The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.</a>
<a id='line_15987'>  Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,</a>
<a id='line_15988'>  O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,</a>

<a id='line_15999'>  A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;</a>
<a id='line_16000'>  Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain</a>

<a id='line_16002'></a>
<a id='line_16003'>  Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,</a>

<a id='line_16012'>  Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;</a>
<a id='line_16013'>  So far the Trojans from their lines retired;</a>
<a id='line_16014'>  Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.</a>

<a id='line_16178'>  Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand."</a>
<a id='line_16179'></a>
<a id='line_16180'>  So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;</a>
<a id='line_16181'>  The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.</a>
<a id='line_16182'>  While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates</a>
<a id='line_16183'>  His panting coursers, in his breast debates,</a>
<a id='line_16184'>  Or in the field his forces to employ,</a>
<a id='line_16185'>  Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_16186'>  Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,</a>
<a id='line_16187'>  In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;</a>
<a id='line_16188'>  (Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,</a>
<a id='line_16189'>  A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)</a>
<a id='line_16190'>  Thus he accosts him. "What a shameful sight!</a>
<a id='line_16191'>  God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?</a>
<a id='line_16192'>  Were thine my vigour this successful spear</a>
<a id='line_16193'>  Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.</a>
<a id='line_16194'>  Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,</a>
<a id='line_16195'>  And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.</a>
<a id='line_16196'>  Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,</a>
<a id='line_16197'>  And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed."</a>
<a id='line_16198'></a>
<a id='line_16199'>  So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,</a>
<a id='line_16200'>  And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.</a>
<a id='line_16201'>  He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;</a>
<a id='line_16202'>  The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.</a>
<a id='line_16203'>  The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,</a>
<a id='line_16204'>  And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.</a>
<a id='line_16205'>  Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;</a>
<a id='line_16206'>  A spear his left, a stone employs his right:</a>
<a id='line_16207'>  With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.</a>
<a id='line_16208'>  Pointed above, and rough and gross below:</a>
<a id='line_16209'>  The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,</a>
<a id='line_16210'>  The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;</a>
<a id='line_16211'>  His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:</a>
<a id='line_16212'>  The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_16213'>  The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,</a>
<a id='line_16214'>  Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_16215'>  To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,</a>
<a id='line_16216'>  While the proud victor thus his fall derides.</a>
<a id='line_16217'></a>
<a id='line_16218'>  "Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!</a>
<a id='line_16219'>  What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!</a>
<a id='line_16220'>  Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!</a>
<a id='line_16221'>  Pity that all their practice is by land!"</a>
<a id='line_16222'></a>
<a id='line_16223'>  Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,</a>
<a id='line_16224'>  To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:</a>
<a id='line_16225'>  Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,</a>
<a id='line_16226'>  That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;</a>
<a id='line_16227'>  Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,</a>
<a id='line_16228'>  And from his fatal courage finds his bane.</a>
<a id='line_16229'>  At once bold Hector leaping from his car,</a>
<a id='line_16230'>  Defends the body, and provokes the war.</a>
<a id='line_16231'>  Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,</a>
<a id='line_16232'>  Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;</a>
<a id='line_16233'>  Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,</a>
<a id='line_16234'>  And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.</a>
<a id='line_16235'>  Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,</a>
<a id='line_16236'>  And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:</a>
<a id='line_16237'>  While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,</a>
<a id='line_16238'>  Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.</a>
<a id='line_16239'>  So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud</a>
<a id='line_16240'>  In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;</a>
<a id='line_16241'>  Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,</a>
<a id='line_16242'>  The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;</a>
<a id='line_16243'>  This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,</a>
<a id='line_16244'>  And the whole forest in one crash descends.</a>
<a id='line_16245'>  Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,</a>
<a id='line_16246'>  In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.</a>
<a id='line_16247'>  Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;</a>
<a id='line_16248'>  Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:</a>
<a id='line_16249'>  Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,</a>
<a id='line_16250'>  Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.</a>
<a id='line_16251'>  But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,</a>
<a id='line_16252'>  Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,</a>
<a id='line_16253'>  And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!</a>
<a id='line_16254'></a>
<a id='line_16255'>  Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven</a>
<a id='line_16256'>  His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;</a>
<a id='line_16257'>  While on each host with equal tempests fell</a>
<a id='line_16258'>  The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.</a>
<a id='line_16259'>  But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,</a>
<a id='line_16260'>  Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.</a>
<a id='line_16261'>  Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,</a>
<a id='line_16262'>  They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.</a>
<a id='line_16263'>  Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,</a>
<a id='line_16264'>  And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.</a>
<a id='line_16265'>  Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,</a>
<a id='line_16266'>  And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.</a>
<a id='line_16267'>  There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine</a>
<a id='line_16268'>  The last, black remnant of so bright a line:</a>
<a id='line_16269'>  Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;</a>
<a id='line_16270'>  Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!</a>
<a id='line_16271'></a>
<a id='line_16272'>  For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,</a>
<a id='line_16273'>  Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.</a>
<a id='line_16274'>  The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;</a>
<a id='line_16275'>  His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel</a>
<a id='line_16276'>  In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,</a>
<a id='line_16277'>  His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.</a>
<a id='line_16278'>  Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;</a>
<a id='line_16279'>  That plume which never stoop'd to earth before;</a>
<a id='line_16280'>  Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,</a>
<a id='line_16281'>  And shade the temples of the mad divine.</a>
<a id='line_16282'>  Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;</a>
<a id='line_16283'>  Not long--for fate pursues him, and the god.</a>
<a id='line_16284'></a>
<a id='line_16285'>  His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield</a>
<a id='line_16286'>  Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:</a>
<a id='line_16287'>  The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:</a>
<a id='line_16288'>  Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;</a>
<a id='line_16289'>  Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:</a>
<a id='line_16290'>  Such is the force of more than mortal hands!</a>
<a id='line_16291'></a>
<a id='line_16292'>  A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,</a>
<a id='line_16293'>  From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;</a>
<a id='line_16294'>  Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,</a>
<a id='line_16295'>  Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:</a>
<a id='line_16296'>  Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,</a>
<a id='line_16297'>  While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.</a>
<a id='line_16298'>  His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;</a>
<a id='line_16299'>  He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.</a>
<a id='line_16300'>  Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:</a>
<a id='line_16301'>  But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.</a>
<a id='line_16302'>  And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.</a>
<a id='line_16303'>  Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,</a>
<a id='line_16304'>  Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,</a>
<a id='line_16305'>  Retires for succour to his social train,</a>
<a id='line_16306'>  And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.</a>
<a id='line_16307'>  Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,</a>
<a id='line_16308'>  Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:</a>
<a id='line_16309'>  The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;</a>
<a id='line_16310'>  He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.</a>
<a id='line_16311'>  With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all</a>
<a id='line_16312'>  Her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.</a>
<a id='line_16313'>  So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,</a>
<a id='line_16314'>  The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,</a>
<a id='line_16315'>  Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,</a>
<a id='line_16316'>  With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;</a>
<a id='line_16317'>  At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;</a>
<a id='line_16318'>  And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.</a>
<a id='line_16319'>  Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_16320'>  So many lives effused, expires his own.</a>
<a id='line_16321'>  As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,</a>
<a id='line_16322'>  He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:</a>
<a id='line_16323'></a>
<a id='line_16324'>  "Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy</a>
<a id='line_16325'>  Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;</a>
<a id='line_16326'>  The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,</a>
<a id='line_16327'>  And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.</a>
<a id='line_16328'>  Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,</a>
<a id='line_16329'>  And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:</a>
<a id='line_16330'>  But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;</a>
<a id='line_16331'>  Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;</a>
<a id='line_16332'>  Though much at parting that great chief might say,</a>
<a id='line_16333'>  And much enjoin thee, this important day.</a>
<a id='line_16334'></a>
<a id='line_16335'>  'Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),</a>
<a id='line_16336'>  Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'</a>
<a id='line_16337'>  He spoke, Patroclus march'd, and thus he sped."</a>
<a id='line_16338'></a>
<a id='line_16339'>  Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,</a>
<a id='line_16340'>  With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:</a>
<a id='line_16341'></a>
<a id='line_16342'>  "Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!</a>
<a id='line_16343'>  Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;</a>
<a id='line_16344'>  To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,</a>
<a id='line_16345'>  And heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.</a>
<a id='line_16346'>  Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,</a>
<a id='line_16347'>  Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:</a>
<a id='line_16348'>  By fate and Phoebus was I first o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_16349'>  Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.</a>
<a id='line_16350'>  But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;</a>
<a id='line_16351'>  The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:</a>
<a id='line_16352'>  Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;</a>
<a id='line_16353'>  Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;</a>
<a id='line_16354'>  Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,</a>
<a id='line_16355'>  I see thee fall, and by Achilles' hand."</a>
<a id='line_16356'></a>
<a id='line_16357'>  He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,</a>
<a id='line_16358'>  (The beauteous body left a load of clay)</a>
<a id='line_16359'>  Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;</a>
<a id='line_16360'>  A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</a>
<a id='line_16361'></a>
<a id='line_16362'>  Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed</a>
<a id='line_16363'>  On the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead:</a>
<a id='line_16364'></a>
<a id='line_16365'>  "From whence this boding speech, the stern decree</a>
<a id='line_16366'>  Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?</a>
<a id='line_16367'>  Why not as well Achilles' fate be given</a>
<a id='line_16368'>  To Hector's lance? Who knows the will of heaven?"</a>
<a id='line_16369'></a>
<a id='line_16370'>  Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay</a>
<a id='line_16371'>  His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;</a>
<a id='line_16372'>  And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear</a>
<a id='line_16373'>  He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.</a>
<a id='line_16374'>  But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins</a>
<a id='line_16375'>  Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,</a>
<a id='line_16376'>  Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;</a>

<a id='line_16392'>THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.--THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.</a>
<a id='line_16393'></a>
<a id='line_16394'>Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:</a>
<a id='line_16395'>Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus retires;</a>
<a id='line_16396'>but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to</a>
<a id='line_16397'>Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from</a>
<a id='line_16398'>Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies</a>
<a id='line_16399'>them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot</a>
<a id='line_16400'>of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of Achilles</a>
<a id='line_16401'>deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick</a>
<a id='line_16402'>darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends</a>
<a id='line_16403'>Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus' death: then returns to</a>
<a id='line_16404'>the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones,</a>
<a id='line_16405'>assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.</a>
<a id='line_16406'></a>
<a id='line_16407'>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in</a>
<a id='line_16408'>the fields before Troy.</a>
<a id='line_16409'></a>
<a id='line_16410'>  On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,</a>
<a id='line_16411'>  Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.</a>
<a id='line_16412'>  Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,</a>
<a id='line_16413'>  Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.</a>
<a id='line_16414'>  Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,</a>
<a id='line_16415'>  Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;</a>
<a id='line_16416'>  And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)</a>
<a id='line_16417'>  Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,</a>
<a id='line_16418'>  Opposed to each that near the carcase came,</a>
<a id='line_16419'>  His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.</a>
<a id='line_16420'></a>
<a id='line_16421'>  The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,</a>
<a id='line_16422'>  Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.</a>
<a id='line_16423'>  "This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;</a>
<a id='line_16424'>  Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:</a>
<a id='line_16425'>  To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:</a>

<a id='line_16430'>  "Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,</a>
<a id='line_16431'>  When mortals boast of prowess not their own?</a>
<a id='line_16432'>  Not thus the lion glories in his might,</a>
<a id='line_16433'>  Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,</a>
<a id='line_16434'>  Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)</a>
<a id='line_16435'>  Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.</a>
<a id='line_16436'>  But far the vainest of the boastful kind,</a>
<a id='line_16437'>  These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.</a>
<a id='line_16438'>  Yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel</a>
<a id='line_16439'>  This boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;</a>
<a id='line_16440'>  Against our arm which rashly he defied,</a>
<a id='line_16441'>  Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.</a>
<a id='line_16442'>  These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,</a>
<a id='line_16443'>  No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.</a>
<a id='line_16444'>  Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,</a>
<a id='line_16445'>  Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;</a>
<a id='line_16446'>  Or, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;</a>
<a id='line_16447'>  Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."</a>
<a id='line_16448'></a>
<a id='line_16449'>  Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: "That action known,</a>
<a id='line_16450'>  Come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.</a>
<a id='line_16451'>  His weeping father claims thy destined head,</a>
<a id='line_16452'>  And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.</a>
<a id='line_16453'>  On these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,</a>

<a id='line_16462'>  Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,</a>
<a id='line_16463'>  It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;</a>
<a id='line_16464'>  Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,</a>
<a id='line_16465'>  Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.</a>
<a id='line_16466'>  The shining circlets of his golden hair,</a>
<a id='line_16467'>  Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,</a>

<a id='line_16473'>  Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,</a>
<a id='line_16474'>  And plays and dances to the gentle air;</a>
<a id='line_16475'>  When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades</a>
<a id='line_16476'>  The tender plant, and withers all its shades;</a>
<a id='line_16477'>  It lies uprooted from its genial bed,</a>

<a id='line_16810'></a>
<a id='line_16811'>  Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:</a>
<a id='line_16812'>  The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.</a>

<a id='line_16843'>  In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;</a>
<a id='line_16844'>  Who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,</a>
<a id='line_16845'>  Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;</a>
<a id='line_16846'>  The whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,</a>
<a id='line_16847'>  Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;</a>

<a id='line_16850'>  Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,</a>

<a id='line_16852'>  Indissolubly firm, around the dead,</a>
<a id='line_16853'>  Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,</a>
<a id='line_16854'>  And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,</a>

<a id='line_16861'>  A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:</a>
<a id='line_16862'>  On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,</a>

<a id='line_16864'></a>
<a id='line_16865'>  Greece, in close order, and collected might,</a>
<a id='line_16866'>  Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;</a>

<a id='line_16883'></a>

<a id='line_16888'>  The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,</a>
<a id='line_16889'>  Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;</a>

<a id='line_16897'>  Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,</a>
<a id='line_16898'>  And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_16899'>  As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,</a>
<a id='line_16900'>  Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,</a>
<a id='line_16901'>  The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er</a>
<a id='line_16902'>  The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:</a>
<a id='line_16903'>  So tugging round the corse both armies stood;</a>
<a id='line_16904'>  The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;</a>
<a id='line_16905'>  While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,</a>

<a id='line_16910'>  Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.</a>
<a id='line_16911'></a>
<a id='line_16912'>  Achilles in his ships at distance lay,</a>

<a id='line_16915'>  In dust extended under Ilion's wall,</a>
<a id='line_16916'>  Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,</a>
<a id='line_16917'>  And for his wish'd return prepares in vain;</a>

<a id='line_16920'>  Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;</a>
<a id='line_16921'>  The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.</a>
<a id='line_16922'></a>
<a id='line_16923'>  Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,</a>
<a id='line_16924'>  And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.</a>
<a id='line_16925'>  "Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)</a>

<a id='line_16952'>  Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late</a>
<a id='line_16953'>  Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,</a>
<a id='line_16954'>  Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,</a>

<a id='line_16956'>  Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,</a>
<a id='line_16957'>  While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_16958'></a>
<a id='line_16959'>  "Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,</a>

<a id='line_16979'></a>
<a id='line_16980'>  He said; and breathing in the immortal horse</a>
<a id='line_16981'>  Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;</a>
<a id='line_16982'>  From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear</a>
<a id='line_16983'>  The kindling chariot through the parted war:</a>
<a id='line_16984'>  So flies a vulture through the clamorous train</a>

<a id='line_17006'></a>
<a id='line_17007'>  He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,</a>

<a id='line_17018'></a>
<a id='line_17019'>  The son of Venus to the counsel yields;</a>

<a id='line_17036'></a>
<a id='line_17037'>  Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,</a>
<a id='line_17038'>  And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,</a>
<a id='line_17039'>  With great Atrides. "Hither turn, (he said,)</a>

<a id='line_17047'></a>

<a id='line_17054'>  Struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,</a>
<a id='line_17055'>  Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:</a>
<a id='line_17056'>  Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,</a>
<a id='line_17057'>  And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.</a>
<a id='line_17058'></a>
<a id='line_17059'>  Now at Automedon the Trojan foe</a>
<a id='line_17060'>  Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,</a>
<a id='line_17061'>  Stooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,</a>
<a id='line_17062'>  And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;</a>
<a id='line_17063'>  Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear</a>
<a id='line_17064'>  In long vibrations spent its fury there.</a>
<a id='line_17065'>  With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,</a>

<a id='line_17083'>  As when high Jove denouncing future woe,</a>
<a id='line_17084'>  O'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,</a>
<a id='line_17085'>  (In sign of tempests from the troubled air,</a>

<a id='line_17087'>  The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,</a>
<a id='line_17088'>  And from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:</a>
<a id='line_17089'>  In such a form the goddess round her drew</a>
<a id='line_17090'>  A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.</a>
<a id='line_17091'>  Assuming Phoenix' shape on earth she falls,</a>
<a id='line_17092'>  And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:</a>

<a id='line_17101'>  Ah, would Minerva send me strength to rear</a>
<a id='line_17102'>  This wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!</a>
<a id='line_17103'>  But Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,</a>

<a id='line_17115'>  And sent his soul with every lance he threw.</a>
<a id='line_17116'></a>
<a id='line_17117'>  There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,</a>
<a id='line_17118'>  Aetion's son, and Podes was his name:</a>

<a id='line_17136'>  This heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,</a>
<a id='line_17137'>  Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.</a>
<a id='line_17138'></a>
<a id='line_17139'>  But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,</a>
<a id='line_17140'>  That shaded Ide and all the subject field</a>
<a id='line_17141'>  Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud</a>
<a id='line_17142'>  Involved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;</a>
<a id='line_17143'>  The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,</a>
<a id='line_17144'>  And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:</a>
<a id='line_17145'>  At one regard of his all-seeing eye</a>
<a id='line_17146'>  The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.</a>
<a id='line_17147'></a>
<a id='line_17148'>  Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;</a>
<a id='line_17149'>  For as the brave Boeotian turn'd his head</a>
<a id='line_17150'>  To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,</a>
<a id='line_17151'>  And razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:</a>
<a id='line_17152'>  By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,</a>
<a id='line_17153'>  Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,</a>
<a id='line_17154'>  Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.</a>
<a id='line_17155'></a>
<a id='line_17156'>  As Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd</a>

<a id='line_17158'>  The brittle point before his corslet yields;</a>
<a id='line_17159'>  Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:</a>
<a id='line_17160'>  High on his chariots the Cretan stood,</a>
<a id='line_17161'>  The son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.</a>
<a id='line_17162'>  But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear</a>
<a id='line_17163'>  Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer</a>
<a id='line_17164'>  Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,</a>
<a id='line_17165'>  Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.</a>
<a id='line_17166'>  On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,</a>
<a id='line_17167'>  Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,</a>
<a id='line_17168'>  But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,</a>
<a id='line_17169'>  And with his life his master's safety bought.</a>
<a id='line_17170'>  Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,</a>
<a id='line_17171'>  The teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.</a>
<a id='line_17172'>  Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;</a>
<a id='line_17173'>  His dying hand forgets the falling rein:</a>
<a id='line_17174'>  This Merion reaches, bending from the car,</a>
<a id='line_17175'>  And urges to desert the hopeless war:</a>
<a id='line_17176'>  Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;</a>
<a id='line_17177'>  And the swift chariot to the navy flies.</a>
<a id='line_17178'></a>
<a id='line_17179'>  Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,</a>
<a id='line_17180'>  And conquest shifting to the Trojan side,</a>

<a id='line_17186'>  Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,</a>
<a id='line_17187'>  He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:</a>
<a id='line_17188'>  Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,</a>
<a id='line_17189'>  He suffers every lance to fall in vain.</a>
<a id='line_17190'>  Deserted of the god, yet let us try</a>
<a id='line_17191'>  What human strength and prudence can supply;</a>
<a id='line_17192'>  If yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,</a>

<a id='line_17200'>  But such a chief I spy not through the host:</a>

<a id='line_17202'>  In general darkness--Lord of earth and air!</a>
<a id='line_17203'>  Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:</a>
<a id='line_17204'>  Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;</a>
<a id='line_17205'>  Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:</a>
<a id='line_17206'>  If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,</a>
<a id='line_17207'>  But let us perish in the face of day!"</a>
<a id='line_17208'></a>
<a id='line_17209'>  With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer</a>
<a id='line_17210'>  The god relenting clear'd the clouded air;</a>
<a id='line_17211'>  Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;</a>
<a id='line_17212'>  The blaze of armour flash'd against the day.</a>
<a id='line_17213'>  "Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;</a>

<a id='line_17216'>  The fatal news"--Atrides hastes away.</a>
<a id='line_17217'></a>
<a id='line_17218'>  So turns the lion from the nightly fold,</a>
<a id='line_17219'>  Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,</a>
<a id='line_17220'>  Long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,</a>
<a id='line_17221'>  Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;</a>
<a id='line_17222'>  The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,</a>
<a id='line_17223'>  And the red terrors of the blazing brands:</a>
<a id='line_17224'>  Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day</a>
<a id='line_17225'>  Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,</a>
<a id='line_17226'>  So moved Atrides from his dangerous place</a>
<a id='line_17227'>  With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;</a>
<a id='line_17228'>  The foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,</a>
<a id='line_17229'>  And much admonish'd, much adjured his train:</a>
<a id='line_17230'></a>
<a id='line_17231'>  "O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,</a>

<a id='line_17244'>  Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,</a>
<a id='line_17245'>  Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.</a>
<a id='line_17246'>  Not with less quickness, his exerted sight</a>
<a id='line_17247'>  Pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:</a>
<a id='line_17248'>  Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,</a>
<a id='line_17249'>  Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:</a>
<a id='line_17250'></a>
<a id='line_17251'>  To him the king: "Beloved of Jove! draw near,</a>
<a id='line_17252'>  For sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear;</a>
<a id='line_17253'>  Thy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!</a>
<a id='line_17254'>  How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.</a>
<a id='line_17255'>  This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore</a>

<a id='line_17257'>  Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell</a>
<a id='line_17258'>  The sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:</a>
<a id='line_17259'>  He too may haste the naked corse to gain:</a>
<a id='line_17260'>  The arms are Hector's, who despoil'd the slain."</a>
<a id='line_17261'></a>
<a id='line_17262'>  The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,</a>
<a id='line_17263'>  From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:</a>
<a id='line_17264'>  Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say</a>
<a id='line_17265'>  What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.</a>
<a id='line_17266'>  To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,</a>
<a id='line_17267'>  Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;</a>
<a id='line_17268'>  Then ran the mournful message to impart,</a>
<a id='line_17269'>  With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.</a>
<a id='line_17270'></a>
<a id='line_17271'>  Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands</a>
<a id='line_17272'>  (Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;</a>
<a id='line_17273'>  But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;</a>
<a id='line_17274'>  Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.</a>
<a id='line_17275'>  "Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);</a>
<a id='line_17276'>  But hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:</a>
<a id='line_17277'>  Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,</a>
<a id='line_17278'>  Unarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.</a>
<a id='line_17279'>  'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,</a>
<a id='line_17280'>  'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,</a>
<a id='line_17281'>  And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate</a>
<a id='line_17282'>  Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate."</a>
<a id='line_17283'></a>
<a id='line_17284'>  "'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,</a>
<a id='line_17285'>  With Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;</a>
<a id='line_17286'>  Myself, and my bold brother will sustain</a>
<a id='line_17287'>  The shock of Hector and his charging train:</a>
<a id='line_17288'>  Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;</a>
<a id='line_17289'>  What Troy can dare, we have already tried,</a>
<a id='line_17290'>  Have tried it, and have stood." The hero said.</a>
<a id='line_17291'>  High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.</a>
<a id='line_17292'>  A general clamour rises at the sight:</a>
<a id='line_17293'>  Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.</a>
<a id='line_17294'>  Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,</a>
<a id='line_17295'>  With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,</a>
<a id='line_17296'>  Voracious hounds, that many a length before</a>
<a id='line_17297'>  Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;</a>
<a id='line_17298'>  But if the savage turns his glaring eye,</a>
<a id='line_17299'>  They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.</a>
<a id='line_17300'>  Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,</a>
<a id='line_17301'>  Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:</a>
<a id='line_17302'>  But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,</a>
<a id='line_17303'>  All pale they tremble and forsake the field.</a>
<a id='line_17304'></a>
<a id='line_17305'>  While thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,</a>
<a id='line_17306'>  Behind them rages all the storm of war:</a>
<a id='line_17307'>  Confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng</a>
<a id='line_17308'>  Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:</a>
<a id='line_17309'>  Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire</a>
<a id='line_17310'>  To whelm some city under waves of fire;</a>
<a id='line_17311'>  Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,</a>
<a id='line_17312'>  Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;</a>
<a id='line_17313'>  The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,</a>
<a id='line_17314'>  And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.</a>
<a id='line_17315'>  The heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:</a>
<a id='line_17316'>  As when two mules, along the rugged road,</a>
<a id='line_17317'>  From the steep mountain with exerted strength</a>
<a id='line_17318'>  Drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;</a>
<a id='line_17319'>  Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,</a>
<a id='line_17320'>  The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:</a>
<a id='line_17321'>  So these--Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,</a>
<a id='line_17322'>  And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.</a>
<a id='line_17323'>  Thus when a river swell'd with sudden rains</a>
<a id='line_17324'>  Spreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,</a>
<a id='line_17325'>  Some interposing hill the stream divides.</a>
<a id='line_17326'>  And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.</a>
<a id='line_17327'>  Still close they follow, close the rear engage;</a>
<a id='line_17328'>  Aeneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:</a>
<a id='line_17329'>  While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,</a>
<a id='line_17330'>  Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,</a>
<a id='line_17331'>  That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung</a>
<a id='line_17332'>  High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.</a>
<a id='line_17333'>  So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,</a>
<a id='line_17334'>  Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:</a>
<a id='line_17335'>  Within, without the trench, and all the way,</a>
<a id='line_17336'>  Strow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;</a>
<a id='line_17337'>  Such horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds</a>
<a id='line_17338'>  The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.</a>

<a id='line_17353'>THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.</a>
<a id='line_17354'></a>
<a id='line_17355'>The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus.</a>
<a id='line_17356'>Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea- nymphs to</a>
<a id='line_17357'>comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion. Iris</a>
<a id='line_17358'>appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders him to show himself</a>
<a id='line_17359'>at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him turns the fortunes of</a>
<a id='line_17360'>the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks. The</a>
<a id='line_17361'>Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their</a>
<a id='line_17362'>opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to remain encamped in the</a>
<a id='line_17363'>field. The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus.</a>
<a id='line_17364'></a>
<a id='line_17365'>Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The</a>
<a id='line_17366'>description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble one</a>
<a id='line_17367'>of the shield of Achilles.</a>
<a id='line_17368'></a>
<a id='line_17369'>The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take</a>
<a id='line_17370'>up this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the sea-shore, from whence</a>
<a id='line_17371'>it changes to the palace of Vulcan.</a>
<a id='line_17372'></a>
<a id='line_17373'>  Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,(250)</a>
<a id='line_17374'>  And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</a>
<a id='line_17375'>  Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,</a>
<a id='line_17376'>  Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:</a>
<a id='line_17377'>  There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,</a>
<a id='line_17378'>  On hoisted yards extended to the gales;</a>
<a id='line_17379'>  Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd</a>
<a id='line_17380'>  Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.</a>
<a id='line_17381'>  Thus to his soul he said: "Ah! what constrains</a>

<a id='line_17383'>  Is this the day, which heaven so long ago</a>

<a id='line_18111'>  Two lions rushing from the wood appear'd;</a>

<a id='line_18166'></a>
<a id='line_18167'>THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</a>
<a id='line_18168'></a>
<a id='line_18169'>Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the body</a>
<a id='line_18170'>of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the army, to</a>
<a id='line_18171'>declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly</a>
<a id='line_18172'>reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion.</a>
<a id='line_18173'>Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle</a>
<a id='line_18174'>till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses. The</a>
<a id='line_18175'>presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments over</a>
<a id='line_18176'>the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives</a>
<a id='line_18177'>himself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen</a>
<a id='line_18178'>him, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight: his appearance</a>
<a id='line_18179'>described. He addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with</a>
<a id='line_18180'>the death of Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and</a>
<a id='line_18181'>inspired to prophesy his fate: but the hero, not astonished by that</a>
<a id='line_18182'>prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.</a>
<a id='line_18183'></a>
<a id='line_18184'>The thirteenth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.</a>
<a id='line_18185'></a>
<a id='line_18186'>  Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head</a>
<a id='line_18187'>  Above the waves, that blush'd with early red,</a>
<a id='line_18188'>  (With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</a>
<a id='line_18189'>  And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)</a>
<a id='line_18190'>  The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears</a>
<a id='line_18191'>  Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears</a>
<a id='line_18192'>  Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse; while all the rest</a>
<a id='line_18193'>  Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.</a>
<a id='line_18194'>  A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,</a>
<a id='line_18195'>  And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:</a>
<a id='line_18196'></a>
<a id='line_18197'>  "Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know</a>
<a id='line_18198'>  It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;</a>
<a id='line_18199'>  Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_18200'>  Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god."</a>
<a id='line_18201'></a>
<a id='line_18202'>  Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_18203'>  Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;</a>
<a id='line_18204'>  Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,</a>
<a id='line_18205'>  And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_18206'>  Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,</a>
<a id='line_18207'>  And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;</a>
<a id='line_18208'>  From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,</a>
<a id='line_18209'>  And flash incessant like a stream of fire:</a>
<a id='line_18210'>  He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind</a>
<a id='line_18211'>  On all the immortal artist had design'd.</a>
<a id='line_18212'></a>
<a id='line_18213'>  "Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine</a>

<a id='line_18215'>  Now to the bloody battle let me bend:</a>

<a id='line_18220'>  "That unavailing care be laid aside,</a>

<a id='line_18223'>  Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.</a>
<a id='line_18224'>  But go, Achilles, as affairs require,</a>

<a id='line_18592'>  With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)</a>
<a id='line_18593'>  Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.</a>
<a id='line_18594'></a>
<a id='line_18595'>  Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,</a>
<a id='line_18596'>  And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain.</a>
<a id='line_18597'>  As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,</a>
<a id='line_18598'>  And scatter o'er the fields the driving snow;</a>
<a id='line_18599'>  From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,</a>
<a id='line_18600'>  Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:</a>
<a id='line_18601'>  So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,</a>
<a id='line_18602'>  Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;</a>
<a id='line_18603'>  Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,</a>
<a id='line_18604'>  Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;</a>
<a id='line_18605'>  Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;</a>
<a id='line_18606'>  With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,</a>
<a id='line_18607'></a>
<a id='line_18608'>  Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,</a>
<a id='line_18609'>  His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd;</a>
<a id='line_18610'>  Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_18611'>  Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.</a>
<a id='line_18612'>  Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,</a>
<a id='line_18613'>  His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;</a>
<a id='line_18614'>  He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay</a>
<a id='line_18615'>  O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.</a>
<a id='line_18616'></a>
<a id='line_18617'>  The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;</a>
<a id='line_18618'>  Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;</a>
<a id='line_18619'>  The brazen sword a various baldric tied,</a>
<a id='line_18620'>  That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;</a>
<a id='line_18621'>  And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield</a>
<a id='line_18622'>  Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.</a>
<a id='line_18623'></a>
<a id='line_18624'>  So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,</a>
<a id='line_18625'>  Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,</a>
<a id='line_18626'>  Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,</a>
<a id='line_18627'>  Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:</a>
<a id='line_18628'>  With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;</a>
<a id='line_18629'>  Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.</a>
<a id='line_18630'></a>
<a id='line_18631'>  Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind</a>
<a id='line_18632'>  The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:</a>
<a id='line_18633'>  Like the red star, that from his flaming hair</a>
<a id='line_18634'>  Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;</a>
<a id='line_18635'>  So stream'd the golden honours from his head,</a>
<a id='line_18636'>  Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.</a>
<a id='line_18637'>  The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;</a>
<a id='line_18638'>  His arms he poises, and his motions tries;</a>
<a id='line_18639'>  Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,</a>
<a id='line_18640'>  And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</a>
<a id='line_18641'></a>
<a id='line_18642'>  And now he shakes his great paternal spear,</a>
<a id='line_18643'>  Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,</a>
<a id='line_18644'>  From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire</a>
<a id='line_18645'>  Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;</a>
<a id='line_18646'>  A spear which stern Achilles only wields,</a>
<a id='line_18647'>  The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</a>
<a id='line_18648'></a>
<a id='line_18649'>  Automedon and Alcimus prepare</a>
<a id='line_18650'>  The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;</a>
<a id='line_18651'>  (The silver traces sweeping at their side;)</a>
<a id='line_18652'>  Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;</a>
<a id='line_18653'>  The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,</a>
<a id='line_18654'>  Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.</a>
<a id='line_18655'>  The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,</a>
<a id='line_18656'>  And swift ascended at one active bound.</a>
<a id='line_18657'>  All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire</a>
<a id='line_18658'>  Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;</a>
<a id='line_18659'>  Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way</a>
<a id='line_18660'>  Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.</a>
<a id='line_18661'>  High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,</a>
<a id='line_18662'>  And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:</a>
<a id='line_18663'></a>
<a id='line_18664'>  "Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,</a>
<a id='line_18665'>  (Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)</a>
<a id='line_18666'>  Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,</a>
<a id='line_18667'>  And learn to make your master more your care:</a>
<a id='line_18668'>  Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,</a>
<a id='line_18669'>  Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord."</a>
<a id='line_18670'></a>
<a id='line_18671'>  The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,</a>
<a id='line_18672'>  Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:</a>
<a id='line_18673'>  Trembling he stood before the golden wain,</a>
<a id='line_18674'>  And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.</a>
<a id='line_18675'>  When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke</a>
<a id='line_18676'>  Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.</a>
<a id='line_18677'>  "Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear</a>
<a id='line_18678'>  Thy rage in safety through the files of war:</a>
<a id='line_18679'>  But come it will, the fatal time must come,</a>
<a id='line_18680'>  Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.</a>
<a id='line_18681'>  Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,</a>
<a id='line_18682'>  Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;</a>
<a id='line_18683'>  The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day</a>
<a id='line_18684'>  (Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms way.</a>
<a id='line_18685'>  No--could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,</a>
<a id='line_18686'>  Or beat the pinions of the western gale,</a>
<a id='line_18687'>  All were in vain--the Fates thy death demand,</a>
<a id='line_18688'>  Due to a mortal and immortal hand."</a>
<a id='line_18689'></a>
<a id='line_18690'>  Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,</a>
<a id='line_18691'>  His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied</a>
<a id='line_18692'>  With unabated rage--"So let it be!</a>
<a id='line_18693'>  Portents and prodigies are lost on me.</a>
<a id='line_18694'>  I know my fate: to die, to see no more</a>
<a id='line_18695'>  My much-loved parents, and my native shore--</a>
<a id='line_18696'>  Enough--when heaven ordains, I sink in night:</a>

<a id='line_18710'>ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_18711'></a>
<a id='line_18712'>THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.</a>
<a id='line_18713'></a>
<a id='line_18714'>Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the gods,</a>
<a id='line_18715'>and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat</a>
<a id='line_18716'>described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages AEneas to meet</a>
<a id='line_18717'>Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; but AEneas</a>
<a id='line_18718'>is preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of</a>
<a id='line_18719'>the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys</a>
<a id='line_18720'>him away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.</a>
<a id='line_18721'></a>
<a id='line_18722'>The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.</a>
<a id='line_18723'></a>
<a id='line_18724'>  Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood</a>
<a id='line_18725'>  Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;</a>
<a id='line_18726'>  While near impending from a neighbouring height,</a>
<a id='line_18727'>  Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.</a>
<a id='line_18728'>  Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call</a>
<a id='line_18729'>  The gods to council in the starry hall:</a>
<a id='line_18730'>  Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,</a>
<a id='line_18731'>  And summons all the senate of the skies.</a>
<a id='line_18732'>  These shining on, in long procession come</a>
<a id='line_18733'>  To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.</a>
<a id='line_18734'>  Not one was absent, not a rural power</a>
<a id='line_18735'>  That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;</a>
<a id='line_18736'>  Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,</a>
<a id='line_18737'>  Each azure sister of the silver flood;</a>
<a id='line_18738'>  All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps</a>
<a id='line_18739'>  His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.</a>
<a id='line_18740'>  On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_18741'>  (The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.</a>
<a id='line_18742'>  Even he whose trident sways the watery reign</a>
<a id='line_18743'>  Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,</a>
<a id='line_18744'>  Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,</a>
<a id='line_18745'>  And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:</a>
<a id='line_18746'></a>
<a id='line_18747'>  "What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,</a>
<a id='line_18748'>  And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,</a>
<a id='line_18749'>  Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?</a>
<a id='line_18750'>  Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?</a>
<a id='line_18751'>  Already met, the louring hosts appear,</a>
<a id='line_18752'>  And death stands ardent on the edge of war."</a>
<a id='line_18753'></a>
<a id='line_18754'>  "'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)</a>
<a id='line_18755'>  This day we call the council of the skies</a>
<a id='line_18756'>  In care of human race; even Jove's own eye</a>
<a id='line_18757'>  Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.</a>
<a id='line_18758'>  Far on Olympus' top in secret state</a>
<a id='line_18759'>  Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate</a>
<a id='line_18760'>  Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,</a>
<a id='line_18761'>  And as your minds direct, your succour lend</a>
<a id='line_18762'>  To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,</a>
<a id='line_18763'>  If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:</a>
<a id='line_18764'>  Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_18765'>  What can they now, if in his rage he rise?</a>
<a id='line_18766'>  Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall</a>
<a id='line_18767'>  May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall."</a>
<a id='line_18768'></a>
<a id='line_18769'>  He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.</a>
<a id='line_18770'>  On adverse parts the warring gods engage:</a>
<a id='line_18771'>  Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round</a>
<a id='line_18772'>  Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;</a>
<a id='line_18773'>  Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;</a>
<a id='line_18774'>  And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:</a>
<a id='line_18775'>  These to the fleet repair with instant flight;</a>
<a id='line_18776'>  The vessels tremble as the gods alight.</a>
<a id='line_18777'>  In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,</a>
<a id='line_18778'>  Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,</a>
<a id='line_18779'>  Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,</a>
<a id='line_18780'>  And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.</a>
<a id='line_18781'>  Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,</a>
<a id='line_18782'>  Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,</a>
<a id='line_18783'>  While great Achilles (terror of the plain),</a>
<a id='line_18784'>  Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.</a>
<a id='line_18785'>  Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;</a>
<a id='line_18786'>  Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;</a>
<a id='line_18787'>  Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,</a>
<a id='line_18788'>  And trembling see another god of war.</a>
<a id='line_18789'></a>
<a id='line_18790'>  But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,</a>
<a id='line_18791'>  Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright</a>
<a id='line_18792'>  Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,</a>
<a id='line_18793'>  Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.</a>
<a id='line_18794'>  Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,</a>
<a id='line_18795'>  And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.</a>
<a id='line_18796'>  Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds</a>
<a id='line_18797'>  In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:</a>
<a id='line_18798'>  Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours</a>
<a id='line_18799'>  With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:</a>
<a id='line_18800'>  Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;</a>
<a id='line_18801'>  The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.</a>
<a id='line_18802'></a>
<a id='line_18803'>  Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,</a>
<a id='line_18804'>  And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.</a>
<a id='line_18805'>  Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;</a>
<a id='line_18806'>  The forests wave, the mountains nod around;</a>
<a id='line_18807'>  Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods,</a>
<a id='line_18808'>  And from their sources boil her hundred floods.</a>
<a id='line_18809'>  Troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain,</a>
<a id='line_18810'>  And the toss'd navies beat the heaving main.</a>
<a id='line_18811'>  Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,(260)</a>
<a id='line_18812'>  The infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head,</a>
<a id='line_18813'>  Leap'd from his throne, lest Neptune's arm should lay</a>
<a id='line_18814'>  His dark dominions open to the day,</a>
<a id='line_18815'>  And pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,</a>
<a id='line_18816'>  Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful even to gods.(261)</a>

<a id='line_18822'></a>
<a id='line_18823'>  Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend</a>
<a id='line_18824'>  The world's vast concave, when the gods contend</a>
<a id='line_18825'>  First silver-shafted Phoebus took the plain</a>
<a id='line_18826'>  Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.</a>
<a id='line_18827'>  The god of arms his giant bulk display'd,</a>
<a id='line_18828'>  Opposed to Pallas, war's triumphant maid.</a>
<a id='line_18829'>  Against Latona march'd the son of May.</a>
<a id='line_18830'>  The quiver'd Dian, sister of the day,</a>

<a id='line_18837'></a>
<a id='line_18838'>  While thus the gods in various league engage,</a>
<a id='line_18839'>  Achilles glow'd with more than mortal rage:</a>
<a id='line_18840'>  Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn'd</a>
<a id='line_18841'>  His eyes around, for Hector only burn'd;</a>
<a id='line_18842'>  And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd</a>

<a id='line_18845'>  AEneas was the first who dared to stay;</a>

<a id='line_18848'>  Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.</a>
<a id='line_18849'>  Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,</a>
<a id='line_18850'>  In voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine;</a>
<a id='line_18851'>  And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn</a>
<a id='line_18852'>  In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.</a>
<a id='line_18853'></a>

<a id='line_19074'>  AEneas his contracted body bends,</a>

<a id='line_19083'>  With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:</a>
<a id='line_19084'>  A mass enormous! which in modern days</a>

<a id='line_19129'>  The godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)</a>
<a id='line_19130'>  With words like these the panting chief address'd:</a>

<a id='line_19254'>  Then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:</a>

<a id='line_19256'></a>
<a id='line_19257'>  Hector, undaunted, thus: "Such words employ</a>

<a id='line_19270'>  Achilles closes with his hated foe,</a>
<a id='line_19271'>  His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:</a>

<a id='line_19310'>  Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:</a>

<a id='line_19368'>THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.(269)</a>
<a id='line_19369'></a>
<a id='line_19370'>The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the</a>
<a id='line_19371'>river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes</a>
<a id='line_19372'>twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills</a>
<a id='line_19373'>Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves: Neptune</a>
<a id='line_19374'>and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length Vulcan, by</a>
<a id='line_19375'>the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This Combat ended, the</a>
<a id='line_19376'>other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter,</a>
<a id='line_19377'>drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away</a>
<a id='line_19378'>in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's</a>
<a id='line_19379'>shape, and while he pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an</a>
<a id='line_19380'>opportunity of retiring into their city.</a>
<a id='line_19381'></a>
<a id='line_19382'>The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of</a>
<a id='line_19383'>Scamander.</a>
<a id='line_19384'></a>
<a id='line_19385'>  And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,</a>
<a id='line_19386'>  Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_19387'>  The river here divides the flying train,</a>
<a id='line_19388'>  Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,</a>
<a id='line_19389'>  Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,</a>
<a id='line_19390'>  Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:</a>
<a id='line_19391'>  (These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,</a>
<a id='line_19392'>  And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)</a>
<a id='line_19393'>  Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,</a>
<a id='line_19394'>  The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:</a>
<a id='line_19395'>  With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,</a>
<a id='line_19396'>  And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,</a>
<a id='line_19397'>  The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.</a>
<a id='line_19398'>  As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,</a>
<a id='line_19399'>  While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;</a>
<a id='line_19400'>  Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</a>
<a id='line_19401'>  The clustering legions rush into the flood:</a>
<a id='line_19402'>  So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,</a>
<a id='line_19403'>  Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</a>
<a id='line_19404'>  His bloody lance the hero casts aside,</a>
<a id='line_19405'>  (Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)</a>
<a id='line_19406'>  Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</a>
<a id='line_19407'>  Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:</a>
<a id='line_19408'>  Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</a>
<a id='line_19409'>  Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;</a>
<a id='line_19410'>  Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</a>
<a id='line_19411'>  And the warm purple circled on the tide.</a>
<a id='line_19412'>  Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,</a>
<a id='line_19413'>  And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</a>
<a id='line_19414'>  So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,</a>
<a id='line_19415'>  In shoals before him fly the scaly train,</a>
<a id='line_19416'>  Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,</a>
<a id='line_19417'>  Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</a>
<a id='line_19418'>  Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band</a>
<a id='line_19419'>  Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;</a>
<a id='line_19420'>  With their rich belts their captive arms restrains</a>
<a id='line_19421'>  (Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).</a>
<a id='line_19422'>  These his attendants to the ships convey'd,</a>
<a id='line_19423'>  Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;</a>
<a id='line_19424'></a>
<a id='line_19425'>  Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,</a>
<a id='line_19426'>  The young Lycaon in his passage stood;</a>
<a id='line_19427'>  The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand</a>
<a id='line_19428'>  But late made captive in his father's land</a>
<a id='line_19429'>  (As from a sycamore, his sounding steel</a>
<a id='line_19430'>  Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)</a>
<a id='line_19431'>  To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,</a>
<a id='line_19432'>  Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;</a>
<a id='line_19433'>  But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,</a>
<a id='line_19434'>  The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.</a>
<a id='line_19435'>  Ten days were past, since in his father's reign</a>
<a id='line_19436'>  He felt the sweets of liberty again;</a>
<a id='line_19437'>  The next, that god whom men in vain withstand</a>
<a id='line_19438'>  Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand</a>
<a id='line_19439'>  Now never to return! and doom'd to go</a>
<a id='line_19440'>  A sadder journey to the shades below.</a>
<a id='line_19441'>  His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,</a>
<a id='line_19442'>  (The helm and visor he had cast aside</a>
<a id='line_19443'>  With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field</a>
<a id='line_19444'>  His useless lance and unavailing shield,)</a>
<a id='line_19445'>  As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,</a>
<a id='line_19446'>  And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said.</a>
<a id='line_19447'>  "Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!</a>
<a id='line_19448'>  Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?</a>
<a id='line_19449'>  Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd</a>
<a id='line_19450'>  Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;</a>
<a id='line_19451'>  As now the captive, whom so late I bound</a>
<a id='line_19452'>  And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!</a>
<a id='line_19453'>  Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,</a>
<a id='line_19454'>  That bar such numbers from their native plain;</a>
<a id='line_19455'>  Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!</a>
<a id='line_19456'>  Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;</a>
<a id='line_19457'>  If earth, at length this active prince can seize,</a>
<a id='line_19458'>  Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules."</a>
<a id='line_19459'></a>
<a id='line_19460'>  Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears</a>
<a id='line_19461'>  Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears</a>
<a id='line_19462'>  Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,</a>
<a id='line_19463'>  And his soul shivering at the approach of death.</a>
<a id='line_19464'>  Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;</a>
<a id='line_19465'>  He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:</a>
<a id='line_19466'>  And while, above, the spear suspended stood,</a>
<a id='line_19467'>  Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,</a>
<a id='line_19468'>  One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,</a>
<a id='line_19469'>  While thus these melting words attempt his heart:</a>
<a id='line_19470'></a>
<a id='line_19471'>  "Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,</a>
<a id='line_19472'>  Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.</a>
<a id='line_19473'>  Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,</a>
<a id='line_19474'>  Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;</a>
<a id='line_19475'>  Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,</a>
<a id='line_19476'>  Far from his father, friends, and native shore;</a>
<a id='line_19477'>  A hundred oxen were his price that day,</a>
<a id='line_19478'>  Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.</a>
<a id='line_19479'>  Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,</a>

<a id='line_19482'>  Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!</a>
<a id='line_19483'>  I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,</a>
<a id='line_19484'>  (Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir;</a>

<a id='line_19667'>  A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;</a>
<a id='line_19668'>  He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;</a>
<a id='line_19669'>  The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.(270)</a>
<a id='line_19670'>  Heaving the bank, and undermining all;</a>
<a id='line_19671'>  Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall</a>
<a id='line_19672'>  Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd</a>

<a id='line_19679'>  The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_19680'>  He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace</a>

<a id='line_19686'>  The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,</a>
<a id='line_19687'>  And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.</a>
<a id='line_19688'>  So when a peasant to his garden brings</a>
<a id='line_19689'>  Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,</a>
<a id='line_19690'>  And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,</a>
<a id='line_19691'>  And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:</a>
<a id='line_19692'>  Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,</a>

<a id='line_20101'>  What if?--But wherefore all this vain debate?</a>
<a id='line_20102'>  Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?</a>
<a id='line_20103'>  Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,</a>
<a id='line_20104'>  The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:</a>
<a id='line_20105'>  Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,</a>
<a id='line_20106'>  And such his valour, that who stands must die.</a>
<a id='line_20107'>  Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,</a>
<a id='line_20108'>  Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.</a>
<a id='line_20109'>  Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel</a>
<a id='line_20110'>  (Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.</a>
<a id='line_20111'>  One only soul informs that dreadful frame:</a>
<a id='line_20112'>  And Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame."</a>
<a id='line_20113'></a>
<a id='line_20114'>  He said, and stood, collected, in his might;</a>
<a id='line_20115'>  And all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.</a>
<a id='line_20116'>  So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,</a>
<a id='line_20117'>  Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:</a>
<a id='line_20118'>  Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds</a>
<a id='line_20119'>  Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;</a>
<a id='line_20120'>  Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;</a>
<a id='line_20121'>  And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:</a>
<a id='line_20122'>  On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;</a>
<a id='line_20123'>  And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.</a>
<a id='line_20124'>  Not less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir</a>
<a id='line_20125'>  Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,</a>
<a id='line_20126'>  Disdainful of retreat: high held before,</a>
<a id='line_20127'>  His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;</a>
<a id='line_20128'>  Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw</a>
<a id='line_20129'>  The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:</a>
<a id='line_20130'></a>
<a id='line_20131'>  "How proud Achilles glories in his fame!</a>

<a id='line_20134'>  A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.</a>

<a id='line_20137'>  Great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore</a>
<a id='line_20138'>  These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore."</a>
<a id='line_20139'></a>
<a id='line_20140'>  He said: with matchless force the javelin flung</a>
<a id='line_20141'>  Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung</a>
<a id='line_20142'>  Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms</a>
<a id='line_20143'>  He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.</a>
<a id='line_20144'>  Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,</a>
<a id='line_20145'>  His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:</a>
<a id='line_20146'>  But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds</a>
<a id='line_20147'>  The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.</a>
<a id='line_20148'>  Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,</a>
<a id='line_20149'>  Dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_20150'>  Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,</a>
<a id='line_20151'>  Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,</a>
<a id='line_20152'>  Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;</a>
<a id='line_20153'>  The furious chief still follows where he flies.</a>
<a id='line_20154'>  Now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,</a>
<a id='line_20155'>  Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:</a>
<a id='line_20156'>  The god, now distant scarce a stride before,</a>
<a id='line_20157'>  Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;</a>
<a id='line_20158'>  While all the flying troops their speed employ,</a>
<a id='line_20159'>  And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:</a>
<a id='line_20160'>  No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,</a>
<a id='line_20161'>  Who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.</a>
<a id='line_20162'>  'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;</a>
<a id='line_20163'>  And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.</a>
<a id='line_20164'>  Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:</a>

<a id='line_20175'></a>
<a id='line_20176'>THE DEATH OF HECTOR.</a>
<a id='line_20177'></a>
<a id='line_20178'>The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose</a>
<a id='line_20179'>Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son</a>
<a id='line_20180'>to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. Hector</a>
<a id='line_20181'>consults within himself what measures to take; but at the advance of</a>
<a id='line_20182'>Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles pursues him</a>
<a id='line_20183'>thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of</a>
<a id='line_20184'>Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles. She deludes</a>
<a id='line_20185'>Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and is slain.</a>
<a id='line_20186'>Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of Priam and</a>
<a id='line_20187'>Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries reach the ears</a>
<a id='line_20188'>of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of</a>
<a id='line_20189'>the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds her dead husband. She</a>
<a id='line_20190'>swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and lamentation.</a>
<a id='line_20191'></a>
<a id='line_20192'>The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on</a>
<a id='line_20193'>the battlements of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_20194'></a>
<a id='line_20195'>  Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,</a>
<a id='line_20196'>  The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:</a>
<a id='line_20197'>  There safe they wipe the briny drops away,</a>
<a id='line_20198'>  And drown in bowls the labours of the day.</a>
<a id='line_20199'>  Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields</a>
<a id='line_20200'>  Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,</a>
<a id='line_20201'>  March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,</a>
<a id='line_20202'>  Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.</a>
<a id='line_20203'>  Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate</a>
<a id='line_20204'>  There fix'd he stood before the Scaean gate;</a>
<a id='line_20205'>  Still his bold arms determined to employ,</a>
<a id='line_20206'>  The guardian still of long-defended Troy.</a>
<a id='line_20207'></a>
<a id='line_20208'>  Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:</a>
<a id='line_20209'>  (The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)</a>
<a id='line_20210'>  "And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,</a>
<a id='line_20211'>  With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?</a>

<a id='line_20213'>  Unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_20214'>  What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?</a>
<a id='line_20215'>  Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:</a>
<a id='line_20216'>  Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_20217'>  While here thy frantic rage attacks a god."</a>
<a id='line_20218'></a>
<a id='line_20219'>  The chief incensed--"Too partial god of day!</a>
<a id='line_20220'>  To check my conquests in the middle way:</a>
<a id='line_20221'>  How few in Ilion else had refuge found!</a>
<a id='line_20222'>  What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!</a>
<a id='line_20223'>  Thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,</a>
<a id='line_20224'>  Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:</a>
<a id='line_20225'>  Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,</a>

<a id='line_20227'></a>
<a id='line_20228'>  Then to the city, terrible and strong,</a>
<a id='line_20229'>  With high and haughty steps he tower'd along,</a>
<a id='line_20230'>  So the proud courser, victor of the prize,</a>
<a id='line_20231'>  To the near goal with double ardour flies.</a>
<a id='line_20232'>  Him, as he blazing shot across the field,</a>
<a id='line_20233'>  The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.</a>
<a id='line_20234'>  Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,(274)</a>
<a id='line_20235'>  Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,</a>
<a id='line_20236'>  Orion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),</a>
<a id='line_20237'>  And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;</a>
<a id='line_20238'>  Terrific glory! for his burning breath</a>
<a id='line_20239'>  Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.</a>
<a id='line_20240'>  So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:</a>
<a id='line_20241'>  He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;</a>
<a id='line_20242'>  He lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;</a>
<a id='line_20243'>  He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:</a>
<a id='line_20244'>  The son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,</a>
<a id='line_20245'>  Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;</a>
<a id='line_20246'>  While the sad father on the rampart stands,</a>
<a id='line_20247'>  And thus adjures him with extended hands:</a>
<a id='line_20248'></a>
<a id='line_20249'>  "Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;</a>
<a id='line_20250'>  Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!</a>
<a id='line_20251'>  Methinks already I behold thee slain,</a>
<a id='line_20252'>  And stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.</a>
<a id='line_20253'>  Implacable Achilles! might'st thou be</a>
<a id='line_20254'>  To all the gods no dearer than to me!</a>
<a id='line_20255'>  Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.</a>
<a id='line_20256'>  And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.</a>
<a id='line_20257'>  How many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,</a>
<a id='line_20258'>  Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:</a>
<a id='line_20259'>  Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles</a>
<a id='line_20260'>  To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.</a>
<a id='line_20261'>  Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,</a>
<a id='line_20262'>  Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,</a>
<a id='line_20263'>  And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!</a>
<a id='line_20264'>  Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,</a>
<a id='line_20265'>  What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!</a>
<a id='line_20266'>  (Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,</a>
<a id='line_20267'>  Consign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)</a>
<a id='line_20268'>  But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,</a>
<a id='line_20269'>  All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;</a>
<a id='line_20270'>  What sorrows then must their sad mother know,</a>
<a id='line_20271'>  What anguish I? unutterable woe!</a>
<a id='line_20272'>  Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,</a>
<a id='line_20273'>  Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.</a>
<a id='line_20274'>  Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;</a>
<a id='line_20275'>  And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!</a>
<a id='line_20276'>  Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave</a>
<a id='line_20277'>  Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.</a>
<a id='line_20278'>  Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;</a>
<a id='line_20279'>  While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,</a>
<a id='line_20280'>  Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage</a>
<a id='line_20281'>  (All trembling on the verge of helpless age)</a>
<a id='line_20282'>  Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!</a>
<a id='line_20283'>  The bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:</a>
<a id='line_20284'>  To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,</a>
<a id='line_20285'>  And number all his days by miseries!</a>
<a id='line_20286'>  My heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,</a>
<a id='line_20287'>  My daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,</a>
<a id='line_20288'>  My bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;</a>
<a id='line_20289'>  These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!</a>
<a id='line_20290'>  Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,</a>
<a id='line_20291'>  The last sad relic of my ruin'd state,</a>
<a id='line_20292'>  (Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,</a>
<a id='line_20293'>  And stain the pavement of my regal hall;</a>
<a id='line_20294'>  Where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,</a>
<a id='line_20295'>  Shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.</a>
<a id='line_20296'>  Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;</a>
<a id='line_20297'>  Well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.</a>
<a id='line_20298'>  Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,</a>
<a id='line_20299'>  Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.</a>
<a id='line_20300'>  But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,</a>
<a id='line_20301'>  Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,</a>
<a id='line_20302'>  In dust the reverend lineaments deform,</a>
<a id='line_20303'>  And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:</a>
<a id='line_20304'>  This, this is misery! the last, the worse,</a>
<a id='line_20305'>  That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!"</a>
<a id='line_20306'></a>
<a id='line_20307'>  He said, and acting what no words could say,</a>
<a id='line_20308'>  Rent from his head the silver locks away.</a>
<a id='line_20309'>  With him the mournful mother bears a part;</a>
<a id='line_20310'>  Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.</a>
<a id='line_20311'>  The zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;</a>
<a id='line_20312'>  And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:</a>
<a id='line_20313'></a>
<a id='line_20314'>  "Have mercy on me, O my son! revere</a>
<a id='line_20315'>  The words of age; attend a parent's prayer!</a>

<a id='line_20324'>  Far from our pious rites those dear remains</a>
<a id='line_20325'>  Must feast the vultures on the naked plains."</a>
<a id='line_20326'></a>
<a id='line_20327'>  So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;</a>
<a id='line_20328'>  But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;</a>
<a id='line_20329'>  Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance</a>
<a id='line_20330'>  Expects the hero's terrible advance.</a>
<a id='line_20331'>  So, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake</a>

<a id='line_20337'>  Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,</a>
<a id='line_20338'>  He stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:(275)</a>
<a id='line_20339'></a>
<a id='line_20340'>  "Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?</a>
<a id='line_20341'>  Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:</a>

<a id='line_20350'>  On my rash courage charge the chance of war,</a>
<a id='line_20351'>  And blame those virtues which they cannot share.</a>
<a id='line_20352'>  No--if I e'er return, return I must</a>

<a id='line_20356'>  And yet suppose these measures I forego,</a>
<a id='line_20357'>  Approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,</a>
<a id='line_20358'>  The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down.</a>
<a id='line_20359'>  And treat on terms of peace to save the town:</a>

<a id='line_20361'>  (Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)</a>
<a id='line_20362'>  With honourable justice to restore:</a>

<a id='line_20366'>  But why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,</a>
<a id='line_20367'>  What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,</a>
<a id='line_20368'>  But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?</a>
<a id='line_20369'>  We greet not here, as man conversing man,</a>
<a id='line_20370'>  Met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;</a>
<a id='line_20371'>  No season now for calm familiar talk,</a>

<a id='line_20375'></a>
<a id='line_20376'>  Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;</a>
<a id='line_20377'>  His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;</a>

<a id='line_20382'>  As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,</a>
<a id='line_20383'>  Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.</a>
<a id='line_20384'>  He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:</a>
<a id='line_20385'>  Achilles follows like the winged wind.</a>
<a id='line_20386'>  Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies</a>
<a id='line_20387'>  (The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),</a>
<a id='line_20388'>  Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,</a>
<a id='line_20389'>  Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,</a>
<a id='line_20390'>  With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,</a>

<a id='line_20422'>  To whom, while eager on the chase they look,</a>

<a id='line_20437'></a>
<a id='line_20438'>  Then Pallas thus: "Shall he whose vengeance forms</a>

<a id='line_20470'></a>
<a id='line_20471'>  What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force</a>
<a id='line_20472'>  With fate itself so long to hold the course?</a>
<a id='line_20473'>  Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,</a>

<a id='line_20477'>  Sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,</a>

<a id='line_20511'></a>
<a id='line_20512'>  Then he: "O prince! allied in blood and fame,</a>

<a id='line_20518'></a>
<a id='line_20519'>  Again the goddess: "Much my father's prayer,</a>

<a id='line_20527'></a>
<a id='line_20528'>  Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:</a>
<a id='line_20529'>  The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.</a>
<a id='line_20530'>  Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:</a>
<a id='line_20531'>  His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_20532'></a>
<a id='line_20533'>  "Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd</a>

<a id='line_20537'>  Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,</a>

<a id='line_20549'></a>
<a id='line_20550'>  "Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,</a>

<a id='line_20566'></a>
<a id='line_20567'>  He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;</a>

<a id='line_20571'>  Minerva watch'd it falling on the land,</a>
<a id='line_20572'>  Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,</a>
<a id='line_20573'>  Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,</a>
<a id='line_20574'>  Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_20575'></a>
<a id='line_20576'>  "The life you boasted to that javelin given,</a>

<a id='line_20588'></a>
<a id='line_20589'>  The weapon flew, its course unerring held,</a>
<a id='line_20590'>  Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd</a>
<a id='line_20591'>  The mortal dart; resulting with a bound</a>
<a id='line_20592'>  From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.</a>

<a id='line_20594'>  Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;</a>
<a id='line_20595'>  He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear--</a>
<a id='line_20596'>  In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.</a>

<a id='line_20609'></a>
<a id='line_20610'>  Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,</a>
<a id='line_20611'>  And, all collected, on Achilles flew.</a>
<a id='line_20612'>  So Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,</a>
<a id='line_20613'>  Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.</a>
<a id='line_20614'>  Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:</a>

<a id='line_20616'>  Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone</a>
<a id='line_20617'>  The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_20618'>  Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)</a>
<a id='line_20619'>  And as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.</a>
<a id='line_20620'>  As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,(277)</a>
<a id='line_20621'>  Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night,</a>
<a id='line_20622'>  When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:</a>
<a id='line_20623'>  So shone the point of great Achilles' spear.</a>
<a id='line_20624'>  In his right hand he waves the weapon round,</a>
<a id='line_20625'>  Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;</a>
<a id='line_20626'>  But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore</a>
<a id='line_20627'>  Securely cased the warrior's body o'er.</a>
<a id='line_20628'>  One space at length he spies, to let in fate,</a>
<a id='line_20629'>  Where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate</a>
<a id='line_20630'>  Gave entrance: through that penetrable part</a>
<a id='line_20631'>  Furious he drove the well-directed dart:</a>
<a id='line_20632'>  Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power</a>
<a id='line_20633'>  Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.</a>
<a id='line_20634'>  Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,</a>
<a id='line_20635'>  While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:</a>
<a id='line_20636'></a>
<a id='line_20637'>  "At last is Hector stretch'd upon the plain,</a>
<a id='line_20638'>  Who fear'd no vengeance for Patroclus slain:</a>

<a id='line_20640'>  Achilles absent was Achilles still:</a>
<a id='line_20641'>  Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,</a>
<a id='line_20642'>  Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.</a>
<a id='line_20643'>  Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,</a>

<a id='line_20646'>  Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour."</a>
<a id='line_20647'></a>
<a id='line_20648'>  Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:</a>
<a id='line_20649'>  "By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!</a>
<a id='line_20650'>  By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;</a>
<a id='line_20651'>  Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!</a>
<a id='line_20652'>  The common rites of sepulture bestow,</a>
<a id='line_20653'>  To soothe a father's and a mother's woe:</a>
<a id='line_20654'>  Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,</a>

<a id='line_20656'></a>
<a id='line_20657'>  "No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;</a>
<a id='line_20658'>  (Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)</a>
<a id='line_20659'>  Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,</a>
<a id='line_20660'>  Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.</a>

<a id='line_20668'>  Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee."</a>
<a id='line_20669'></a>
<a id='line_20670'>  Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:</a>
<a id='line_20671'>  "Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:</a>
<a id='line_20672'>  The Furies that relentless breast have steel'd,</a>

<a id='line_20678'></a>
<a id='line_20679'>  He ceased. The Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,</a>
<a id='line_20680'>  And his eyes stiffen'd at the hand of death;</a>
<a id='line_20681'>  To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,</a>
<a id='line_20682'>  (The manly body left a load of clay,)</a>

<a id='line_20684'>  A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!</a>
<a id='line_20685'></a>
<a id='line_20686'>  Achilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes</a>
<a id='line_20687'>  O'er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:</a>
<a id='line_20688'>  "Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,</a>

<a id='line_20690'>  Then forcing backward from the gaping wound</a>
<a id='line_20691'>  The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.</a>

<a id='line_20924'>Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After the</a>
<a id='line_20925'>funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the</a>
<a id='line_20926'>ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial; the</a>
<a id='line_20927'>next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood</a>
<a id='line_20928'>for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the</a>
<a id='line_20929'>dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly twelve Trojan</a>
<a id='line_20930'>captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays libations to the</a>
<a id='line_20931'>Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise the flames. When</a>
<a id='line_20932'>the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn</a>
<a id='line_20933'>of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes the funeral games: the</a>
<a id='line_20934'>chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the</a>
<a id='line_20935'>single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the</a>
<a id='line_20936'>javelin: the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the</a>
<a id='line_20937'>several antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.</a>

<a id='line_20939'>In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of</a>

<a id='line_20941'>felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and</a>
<a id='line_20942'>the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the</a>

<a id='line_20944'></a>
<a id='line_20945'>  Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train</a>

<a id='line_20965'>  For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,</a>

<a id='line_21072'>  Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,</a>
<a id='line_21073'>  Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:</a>

<a id='line_21079'>  This night my friend, so late in battle lost,</a>

<a id='line_21083'></a>
<a id='line_21084'>  Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:</a>
<a id='line_21085'>  And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,</a>
<a id='line_21086'>  Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,</a>

<a id='line_21088'>  But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,</a>
<a id='line_21089'>  With mules and waggons sends a chosen band</a>
<a id='line_21090'>  To load the timber, and the pile to rear;</a>
<a id='line_21091'>  A charge consign'd to Merion's faithful care.</a>
<a id='line_21092'>  With proper instruments they take the road,</a>
<a id='line_21093'>  Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.</a>
<a id='line_21094'>  First march the heavy mules, securely slow,</a>
<a id='line_21095'>  O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go:(285)</a>
<a id='line_21096'>  Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground,</a>
<a id='line_21097'>  Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound</a>
<a id='line_21098'>  But when arrived at Ida's spreading woods,(286)</a>
<a id='line_21099'>  (Fair Ida, water'd with descending floods,)</a>

<a id='line_21107'>  (Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;</a>
<a id='line_21108'>  There on the spot which great Achilles show'd,</a>
<a id='line_21109'>  They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;</a>

<a id='line_21111'>  Shall view Patroclus' and Achilles' tomb.</a>

<a id='line_21119'>  Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;</a>
<a id='line_21120'>  O'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;</a>
<a id='line_21121'>  Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,</a>
<a id='line_21122'>  Supporting with his hands the hero's head,</a>
<a id='line_21123'>  Bends o'er the extended body of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_21124'>  Patroclus decent on the appointed ground</a>
<a id='line_21125'>  They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.</a>
<a id='line_21126'>  But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,</a>
<a id='line_21127'>  And from his head divides the yellow hair;</a>
<a id='line_21128'>  Those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,(287)</a>
<a id='line_21129'>  And sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:</a>
<a id='line_21130'>  Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,</a>
<a id='line_21131'>  And roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:</a>
<a id='line_21132'></a>
<a id='line_21133'>  "Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost</a>
<a id='line_21134'>  Delightful roll along my native coast!</a>
<a id='line_21135'>  To whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,</a>
<a id='line_21136'>  These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:</a>
<a id='line_21137'>  Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_21138'>  Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,</a>
<a id='line_21139'>  And where in shade of consecrated bowers</a>
<a id='line_21140'>  Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!</a>
<a id='line_21141'>  So vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;</a>
<a id='line_21142'>  No more Achilles sees his native plain;</a>
<a id='line_21143'>  In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,</a>
<a id='line_21144'>  Patroclus bears them to the shades below."</a>
<a id='line_21145'></a>
<a id='line_21146'>  Thus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,</a>
<a id='line_21147'>  On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.</a>
<a id='line_21148'>  Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:</a>
<a id='line_21149'>  And now the sun had set upon their woe;</a>
<a id='line_21150'>  But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:</a>
<a id='line_21151'>  "Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:</a>
<a id='line_21152'>  Permit the mourning legions to retire,</a>
<a id='line_21153'>  And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;</a>
<a id='line_21154'>  The pious care be ours, the dead to burn--"</a>
<a id='line_21155'>  He said: the people to their ships return:</a>
<a id='line_21156'>  While those deputed to inter the slain</a>
<a id='line_21157'>  Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.(288)</a>
<a id='line_21158'>  A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,</a>
<a id='line_21159'>  The growing structure spreads on every side;</a>
<a id='line_21160'>  High on the top the manly corse they lay,</a>
<a id='line_21161'>  And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:</a>
<a id='line_21162'>  Achilles covered with their fat the dead,</a>
<a id='line_21163'>  And the piled victims round the body spread;</a>
<a id='line_21164'>  Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,</a>
<a id='line_21165'>  Suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.</a>
<a id='line_21166'>  Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan</a>
<a id='line_21167'>  Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.</a>
<a id='line_21168'>  Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,</a>
<a id='line_21169'>  Fall two, selected to attend their lord,</a>
<a id='line_21170'>  Then last of all, and horrible to tell,</a>
<a id='line_21171'>  Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.(289)</a>
<a id='line_21172'>  On these the rage of fire victorious preys,</a>
<a id='line_21173'>  Involves and joins them in one common blaze.</a>
<a id='line_21174'>  Smear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,</a>
<a id='line_21175'>  And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:(290)</a>
<a id='line_21176'></a>
<a id='line_21177'>  "All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost</a>
<a id='line_21178'>  Hear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.</a>
<a id='line_21179'>  Behold Achilles' promise fully paid,</a>
<a id='line_21180'>  Twelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;</a>
<a id='line_21181'>  But heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,</a>
<a id='line_21182'>  Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend."</a>
<a id='line_21183'></a>
<a id='line_21184'>  So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain</a>
<a id='line_21185'>  His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:</a>
<a id='line_21186'>  Celestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,</a>
<a id='line_21187'>  And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:</a>
<a id='line_21188'>  She watch'd him all the night and all the day,</a>

<a id='line_21190'>  Nor sacred Phoebus less employ'd his care;</a>
<a id='line_21191'>  He pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,</a>
<a id='line_21192'>  And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,</a>
<a id='line_21193'>  Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.</a>

<a id='line_21239'>  As a poor father, helpless and undone,</a>
<a id='line_21240'>  Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,</a>

<a id='line_21306'>  Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:</a>
<a id='line_21307'>  An ample double bowl contents the last.</a>
<a id='line_21308'>  These in fair order ranged upon the plain,</a>
<a id='line_21309'>  The hero, rising, thus address'd the train:</a>

<a id='line_21321'>  Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,</a>
<a id='line_21322'>  And trail those graceful honours on the sand!</a>

<a id='line_21324'>  Who trust the courser and the flying car."</a>
<a id='line_21325'></a>
<a id='line_21326'>  Fired at his word the rival racers rise;</a>
<a id='line_21327'>  But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,</a>

<a id='line_21336'>  Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),</a>
<a id='line_21337'>  To 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,</a>

<a id='line_21339'>  Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.</a>
<a id='line_21340'>  Next him Antilochus demands the course</a>
<a id='line_21341'>  With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.</a>
<a id='line_21342'>  Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,</a>
<a id='line_21343'>  Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;</a>
<a id='line_21344'>  Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears</a>

<a id='line_21346'></a>
<a id='line_21347'>  "My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,</a>

<a id='line_21354'>  Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own:</a>
<a id='line_21355'>  It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,</a>

<a id='line_21377'>  (Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;</a>
<a id='line_21378'>  Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)</a>
<a id='line_21379'>  Bear close to this, and warily proceed,</a>

<a id='line_21384'>  The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.</a>
<a id='line_21385'>  Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)</a>
<a id='line_21386'>  Clear of the stony heap direct the course;</a>
<a id='line_21387'>  Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be</a>
<a id='line_21388'>  A joy to others, a reproach to me.</a>
<a id='line_21389'>  So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,</a>
<a id='line_21390'>  And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:</a>
<a id='line_21391'>  Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed</a>
<a id='line_21392'>  Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;</a>
<a id='line_21393'>  Or the famed race, through all the regions known,</a>
<a id='line_21394'>  That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon."</a>
<a id='line_21395'></a>
<a id='line_21396'>  Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage</a>
<a id='line_21397'>  Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.</a>
<a id='line_21398'>  Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,</a>
<a id='line_21399'>  The last, but not least ardent for the prize.</a>
<a id='line_21400'>  They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose</a>
<a id='line_21401'>  (Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).</a>
<a id='line_21402'>  Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;</a>
<a id='line_21403'>  And next the brother of the king of men:</a>
<a id='line_21404'>  Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;</a>
<a id='line_21405'>  And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.</a>
<a id='line_21406'>  They stand in order, an impatient train:</a>
<a id='line_21407'>  Pelides points the barrier on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_21408'>  And sends before old Phoenix to the place,</a>
<a id='line_21409'>  To mark the racers, and to judge the race.</a>
<a id='line_21410'>  At once the coursers from the barrier bound;</a>
<a id='line_21411'>  The lifted scourges all at once resound;</a>
<a id='line_21412'>  Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;</a>
<a id='line_21413'>  And up the champaign thunder from the shore:</a>
<a id='line_21414'>  Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,</a>
<a id='line_21415'>  And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;</a>
<a id='line_21416'>  Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,</a>
<a id='line_21417'>  Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:</a>
<a id='line_21418'>  The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,</a>
<a id='line_21419'>  Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.</a>
<a id='line_21420'>  While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,</a>
<a id='line_21421'>  (Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)</a>
<a id='line_21422'>  Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,</a>
<a id='line_21423'>  They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.</a>
<a id='line_21424'>  Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)</a>
<a id='line_21425'>  At the near prize each gathers all his soul,</a>
<a id='line_21426'>  Each burns with double hope, with double pain,</a>
<a id='line_21427'>  Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.</a>
<a id='line_21428'>  First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;</a>
<a id='line_21429'>  With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:</a>
<a id='line_21430'>  Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,</a>
<a id='line_21431'>  And seem just mounting on his car behind;</a>
<a id='line_21432'>  Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,</a>
<a id='line_21433'>  And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.</a>
<a id='line_21434'>  Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;</a>
<a id='line_21435'>  But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,</a>
<a id='line_21436'>  Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain</a>
<a id='line_21437'>  His matchless horses' labour on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_21438'>  Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey</a>
<a id='line_21439'>  Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.</a>
<a id='line_21440'>  The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,</a>
<a id='line_21441'>  Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,</a>
<a id='line_21442'>  And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke</a>
<a id='line_21443'>  She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:</a>
<a id='line_21444'>  No more their way the startled horses held;</a>
<a id='line_21445'>  The car reversed came rattling on the field;</a>
<a id='line_21446'>  Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,</a>
<a id='line_21447'>  Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;</a>
<a id='line_21448'>  His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;</a>
<a id='line_21449'>  Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:</a>
<a id='line_21450'>  Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_21451'>  Before him far the glad Tydides flies;</a>
<a id='line_21452'>  Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,</a>
<a id='line_21453'>  And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.</a>
<a id='line_21454'></a>
<a id='line_21455'>  The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;</a>
<a id='line_21456'>  While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:</a>
<a id='line_21457'>  "Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;</a>
<a id='line_21458'>  Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,</a>
<a id='line_21459'>  Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,</a>
<a id='line_21460'>  And gives their lord the honours of the day;</a>
<a id='line_21461'>  But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo</a>
<a id='line_21462'>  Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?</a>
<a id='line_21463'>  Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain</a>
<a id='line_21464'>  The last ignoble gift be all we gain,</a>
<a id='line_21465'>  No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,</a>
<a id='line_21466'>  The old man's fury rises, and ye die.</a>
<a id='line_21467'>  Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,</a>
<a id='line_21468'>  Presents the occasion, could we use it right."</a>
<a id='line_21469'></a>
<a id='line_21470'>  Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat</a>
<a id='line_21471'>  With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.</a>
<a id='line_21472'>  And now Antilochus with nice survey</a>
<a id='line_21473'>  Observes the compass of the hollow way.</a>
<a id='line_21474'>  'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,</a>
<a id='line_21475'>  Fast by the road a precipice was worn:</a>
<a id='line_21476'>  Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng</a>
<a id='line_21477'>  The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.</a>
<a id='line_21478'>  Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,</a>
<a id='line_21479'>  Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.</a>
<a id='line_21480'>  Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,</a>
<a id='line_21481'>  And wonders at the rashness of his foe.</a>
<a id='line_21482'>  "Hold, stay your steeds--What madness thus to ride</a>
<a id='line_21483'>  This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),</a>
<a id='line_21484'>  Or both must fall."--Atrides cried in vain;</a>
<a id='line_21485'>  He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.</a>
<a id='line_21486'>  Far as an able arm the disk can send,</a>
<a id='line_21487'>  When youthful rivals their full force extend,</a>
<a id='line_21488'>  So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew</a>
<a id='line_21489'>  Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew</a>
<a id='line_21490'>  His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears</a>
<a id='line_21491'>  The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,</a>
<a id='line_21492'>  The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_21493'>  And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.</a>
<a id='line_21494'>  But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:</a>
<a id='line_21495'>  "Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!</a>
<a id='line_21496'>  Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;</a>
<a id='line_21497'>  Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine--"</a>
<a id='line_21498'>  Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,</a>
<a id='line_21499'>  "Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!</a>
<a id='line_21500'>  Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,</a>
<a id='line_21501'>  With fainting knees shall labour in the course,</a>
<a id='line_21502'>  And yield the glory yours."--The steeds obey;</a>
<a id='line_21503'>  Already at their heels they wing their way,</a>
<a id='line_21504'>  And seem already to retrieve the day.</a>
<a id='line_21505'></a>
<a id='line_21506'>  Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld</a>
<a id='line_21507'>  The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.</a>
<a id='line_21508'>  The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;</a>
<a id='line_21509'>  High on a rising ground, above the ring,</a>
<a id='line_21510'>  The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey</a>
<a id='line_21511'>  He well observed the chief who led the way,</a>
<a id='line_21512'>  And heard from far his animating cries,</a>
<a id='line_21513'>  And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;</a>
<a id='line_21514'>  On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,</a>
<a id='line_21515'>  Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.</a>
<a id='line_21516'>  He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:</a>
<a id='line_21517'>  "Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?</a>
<a id='line_21518'>  Or can ye, all, another chief survey,</a>
<a id='line_21519'>  And other steeds than lately led the way?</a>
<a id='line_21520'>  Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,</a>
<a id='line_21521'>  Lie sure disabled in the middle field:</a>
<a id='line_21522'>  For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain</a>
<a id='line_21523'>  I search to find them, but I search in vain.</a>
<a id='line_21524'>  Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,</a>
<a id='line_21525'>  And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,</a>
<a id='line_21526'>  Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray</a>
<a id='line_21527'>  With frantic fury from the destined way.</a>
<a id='line_21528'>  Rise then some other, and inform my sight,</a>
<a id='line_21529'>  For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;</a>
<a id='line_21530'>  Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,</a>
<a id='line_21531'>  The great AEtolian chief, renown'd in war."</a>
<a id='line_21532'></a>
<a id='line_21533'>  "Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)</a>
<a id='line_21534'>  Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;</a>
<a id='line_21535'>  Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,</a>
<a id='line_21536'>  Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.</a>
<a id='line_21537'>  Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,</a>
<a id='line_21538'>  Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:</a>
<a id='line_21539'>  I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,</a>
<a id='line_21540'>  And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain."</a>
<a id='line_21541'></a>
<a id='line_21542'>  Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:</a>
<a id='line_21543'>  "Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!</a>
<a id='line_21544'>  Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside</a>
<a id='line_21545'>  The last in merit, as the first in pride!</a>
<a id='line_21546'>  To vile reproach what answer can we make?</a>
<a id='line_21547'>  A goblet or a tripod let us stake,</a>
<a id='line_21548'>  And be the king the judge. The most unwise</a>
<a id='line_21549'>  Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price."</a>
<a id='line_21550'></a>
<a id='line_21551'>  He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,</a>
<a id='line_21552'>  Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn</a>
<a id='line_21553'>  To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son</a>
<a id='line_21554'>  Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:</a>
<a id='line_21555'></a>
<a id='line_21556'>  "Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;</a>
<a id='line_21557'>  Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:</a>
<a id='line_21558'>  And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end."</a>
<a id='line_21559'>  No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,</a>
<a id='line_21560'>  Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.</a>
<a id='line_21561'>  High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:</a>
<a id='line_21562'>  His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:</a>
<a id='line_21563'>  His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_21564'>  Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,</a>
<a id='line_21565'>  Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find</a>
<a id='line_21566'>  The track his flying wheels had left behind:</a>
<a id='line_21567'>  And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace</a>
<a id='line_21568'>  So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.</a>
<a id='line_21569'>  Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,</a>
<a id='line_21570'>  Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;</a>
<a id='line_21571'>  From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;</a>
<a id='line_21572'>  The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:</a>
<a id='line_21573'>  With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,</a>

<a id='line_21575'>  These to the ships his train triumphant leads,</a>
<a id='line_21576'>  The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.</a>
<a id='line_21577'></a>
<a id='line_21578'>  Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,</a>
<a id='line_21579'>  O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.</a>
<a id='line_21580'>  Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near</a>

<a id='line_21582'>  The following car, just touching with his heel</a>
<a id='line_21583'>  And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:</a>

<a id='line_21586'>  So soon swift AEthe her lost ground regain'd,</a>
<a id='line_21587'>  One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.</a>
<a id='line_21588'></a>
<a id='line_21589'>  Merion pursued, at greater distance still,</a>
<a id='line_21590'>  With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.</a>
<a id='line_21591'>  Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;</a>
<a id='line_21592'>  Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:</a>

<a id='line_21600'></a>
<a id='line_21601'>  The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,</a>

<a id='line_21603'>  But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,</a>
<a id='line_21604'>  The award opposes, and asserts his claim.</a>
<a id='line_21605'>  "Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,</a>
<a id='line_21606'>  O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.</a>
<a id='line_21607'>  What if the gods, the skilful to confound,</a>
<a id='line_21608'>  Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?</a>
<a id='line_21609'>  Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,</a>
<a id='line_21610'>  And vows omitted forfeited the prize.</a>
<a id='line_21611'>  If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,</a>
<a id='line_21612'>  And please a soul desirous to bestow)</a>
<a id='line_21613'>  Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store</a>
<a id='line_21614'>  Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;</a>
<a id='line_21615'>  An ample present let him thence receive,</a>
<a id='line_21616'>  And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.</a>
<a id='line_21617'>  But this my prize I never shall forego;</a>
<a id='line_21618'>  This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe."</a>
<a id='line_21619'></a>
<a id='line_21620'>  Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;</a>
<a id='line_21621'>  Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,</a>
<a id='line_21622'>  Achilles smiled: "The gift proposed (he cried),</a>
<a id='line_21623'>  Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.</a>
<a id='line_21624'>  With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_21625'>  (The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)</a>
<a id='line_21626'>  Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,</a>
<a id='line_21627'>  (No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine."</a>
<a id='line_21628'></a>
<a id='line_21629'>  He said: Automedon at his command</a>
<a id='line_21630'>  The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.</a>
<a id='line_21631'>  Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows</a>
<a id='line_21632'>  With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;</a>
<a id='line_21633'>  The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,</a>
<a id='line_21634'>  And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.</a>
<a id='line_21635'>  Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,</a>
<a id='line_21636'>  And inly grieving, thus the king begun:</a>
<a id='line_21637'></a>
<a id='line_21638'>  "The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,</a>
<a id='line_21639'>  An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.</a>
<a id='line_21640'>  Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,</a>
<a id='line_21641'>  To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:</a>
<a id='line_21642'>  So not a leader shall our conduct blame,</a>
<a id='line_21643'>  Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.</a>
<a id='line_21644'>  But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?</a>
<a id='line_21645'>  What needs appealing in a fact so plain?</a>
<a id='line_21646'>  What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,</a>
<a id='line_21647'>  And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?</a>
<a id='line_21648'>  Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,</a>
<a id='line_21649'>  The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;</a>
<a id='line_21650'>  And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent</a>
<a id='line_21651'>  Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.</a>
<a id='line_21652'>  Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround</a>
<a id='line_21653'>  The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!"</a>
<a id='line_21654'></a>
<a id='line_21655'>  The prudent chief with calm attention heard;</a>
<a id='line_21656'>  Then mildly thus: "Excuse, if youth have err'd;</a>
<a id='line_21657'>  Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,</a>
<a id='line_21658'>  Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.</a>
<a id='line_21659'>  Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,</a>
<a id='line_21660'>  Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.</a>
<a id='line_21661'>  The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;</a>
<a id='line_21662'>  The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine</a>
<a id='line_21663'>  Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)</a>
<a id='line_21664'>  Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn."</a>
<a id='line_21665'></a>
<a id='line_21666'>  So spoke Antilochus; and at the word</a>
<a id='line_21667'>  The mare contested to the king restored.</a>
<a id='line_21668'>  Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain</a>
<a id='line_21669'>  Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,</a>
<a id='line_21670'>  The fields their vegetable life renew,</a>
<a id='line_21671'>  And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;</a>
<a id='line_21672'>  Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,</a>
<a id='line_21673'>  And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:</a>
<a id='line_21674'></a>
<a id='line_21675'>  "Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree</a>
<a id='line_21676'>  'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.</a>
<a id='line_21677'>  Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,</a>
<a id='line_21678'>  Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.</a>
<a id='line_21679'>  Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way</a>
<a id='line_21680'>  To waive contention with superior sway;</a>
<a id='line_21681'>  For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,</a>
<a id='line_21682'>  Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!</a>
<a id='line_21683'>  To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,</a>
<a id='line_21684'>  Suffice thy father's merit and thy own:</a>
<a id='line_21685'>  Generous alike, for me, the sire and son</a>
<a id='line_21686'>  Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.</a>
<a id='line_21687'>  I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,</a>
<a id='line_21688'>  Nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend."</a>
<a id='line_21689'></a>
<a id='line_21690'>  He said; and pleased his passion to command,</a>
<a id='line_21691'>  Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,</a>
<a id='line_21692'>  Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,</a>
<a id='line_21693'>  The shining charger to his vessel sent.</a>
<a id='line_21694'>  The golden talents Merion next obtain'd;</a>
<a id='line_21695'>  The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.</a>
<a id='line_21696'>  Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.</a>
<a id='line_21697'>  And thus the purpose of his gift declares:</a>
<a id='line_21698'>  "Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)</a>
<a id='line_21699'>  In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;</a>
<a id='line_21700'>  Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,</a>
<a id='line_21701'>  For ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes!</a>
<a id='line_21702'>  Take thou this token of a grateful heart,</a>
<a id='line_21703'>  Though 'tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,</a>
<a id='line_21704'>  The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,</a>
<a id='line_21705'>  Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:</a>
<a id='line_21706'>  Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_21707'>  But left the glory of the past thy own."</a>
<a id='line_21708'></a>
<a id='line_21709'>  He said, and placed the goblet at his side;</a>
<a id='line_21710'>  With joy the venerable king replied:</a>
<a id='line_21711'></a>
<a id='line_21712'>  "Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved</a>
<a id='line_21713'>  A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!</a>
<a id='line_21714'>  Too true it is, deserted of my strength,</a>
<a id='line_21715'>  These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.</a>
<a id='line_21716'>  Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,</a>
<a id='line_21717'>  Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!</a>
<a id='line_21718'>  Victorious then in every solemn game,</a>
<a id='line_21719'>  Ordain'd to Amarynces' mighty name;</a>
<a id='line_21720'>  The brave Epeians gave my glory way,</a>
<a id='line_21721'>  AEtolians, Pylians, all resign'd the day.</a>
<a id='line_21722'>  I quell'd Clytomedes in fights of hand,</a>
<a id='line_21723'>  And backward hurl'd Ancaeus on the sand,</a>
<a id='line_21724'>  Surpass'd Iphyclus in the swift career,</a>
<a id='line_21725'>  Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.</a>
<a id='line_21726'>  The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,</a>
<a id='line_21727'>  But won by numbers, not by art or force:</a>
<a id='line_21728'>  For the famed twins, impatient to survey</a>
<a id='line_21729'>  Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,</a>
<a id='line_21730'>  Sprung to their car; and with united pains</a>
<a id='line_21731'>  One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.</a>
<a id='line_21732'>  Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds</a>
<a id='line_21733'>  A younger race, that emulate our deeds:</a>
<a id='line_21734'>  I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)</a>
<a id='line_21735'>  Though once the foremost hero of the field.</a>
<a id='line_21736'>  Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,</a>
<a id='line_21737'>  With martial honours decorate the dead:</a>
<a id='line_21738'>  While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,</a>
<a id='line_21739'>  (Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)</a>
<a id='line_21740'>  Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see</a>
<a id='line_21741'>  Not one but honours sacred age and me:</a>
<a id='line_21742'>  Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,</a>
<a id='line_21743'>  May the just gods return another day!"</a>
<a id='line_21744'></a>
<a id='line_21745'>  Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:</a>
<a id='line_21746'>  Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.</a>
<a id='line_21747'></a>
<a id='line_21748'>  The prizes next are order'd to the field,</a>
<a id='line_21749'>  For the bold champions who the caestus wield.</a>
<a id='line_21750'>  A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,</a>
<a id='line_21751'>  Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,</a>
<a id='line_21752'>  Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;</a>
<a id='line_21753'>  Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.</a>
<a id='line_21754'>  Achilles rising, thus: "Let Greece excite</a>
<a id='line_21755'>  Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;</a>
<a id='line_21756'>  Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,</a>
<a id='line_21757'>  And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.</a>
<a id='line_21758'>  On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,</a>
<a id='line_21759'>  And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,</a>
<a id='line_21760'>  This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,</a>
<a id='line_21761'>  The vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away."</a>
<a id='line_21762'></a>
<a id='line_21763'>  This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;(291)</a>
<a id='line_21764'>  High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,</a>
<a id='line_21765'>  And seized the beast, and thus began to say:</a>
<a id='line_21766'>  "Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!</a>
<a id='line_21767'>  (Price of his ruin: for who dares deny</a>
<a id='line_21768'>  This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)</a>
<a id='line_21769'>  Others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,</a>
<a id='line_21770'>  But the first honours of this fight are mine;</a>
<a id='line_21771'>  For who excels in all? Then let my foe</a>
<a id='line_21772'>  Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;</a>
<a id='line_21773'>  Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,</a>
<a id='line_21774'>  Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:</a>
<a id='line_21775'>  So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,</a>
<a id='line_21776'>  To heave the batter'd carcase off the plain."</a>
<a id='line_21777'></a>
<a id='line_21778'>  The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze</a>
<a id='line_21779'>  The host beheld him, silent with amaze!</a>
<a id='line_21780'>  'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire</a>
<a id='line_21781'>  To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,</a>
<a id='line_21782'>  The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore</a>
<a id='line_21783'>  In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,</a>
<a id='line_21784'>  (The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)</a>
<a id='line_21785'>  And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.</a>
<a id='line_21786'>  Him great Tydides urges to contend,</a>
<a id='line_21787'>  Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;</a>
<a id='line_21788'>  Officious with the cincture girds him round;</a>
<a id='line_21789'>  And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.</a>
<a id='line_21790'>  Amid the circle now each champion stands,</a>
<a id='line_21791'>  And poises high in air his iron hands;</a>
<a id='line_21792'>  With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,</a>
<a id='line_21793'>  Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,</a>
<a id='line_21794'>  And painful sweat from all their members flows.</a>
<a id='line_21795'>  At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow</a>
<a id='line_21796'>  Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;</a>
<a id='line_21797'>  Beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway</a>
<a id='line_21798'>  Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.</a>
<a id='line_21799'>  As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,</a>
<a id='line_21800'>  By some huge billow dash'd against the shore,</a>
<a id='line_21801'>  Lies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,</a>
<a id='line_21802'>  The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_21803'>  To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,</a>
<a id='line_21804'>  Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;</a>
<a id='line_21805'>  Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,</a>
<a id='line_21806'>  And dragging his disabled legs along;</a>
<a id='line_21807'>  Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;</a>
<a id='line_21808'>  His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;(292)</a>
<a id='line_21809'>  Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;</a>
<a id='line_21810'>  His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.</a>
<a id='line_21811'></a>
<a id='line_21812'>  The third bold game Achilles next demands,</a>
<a id='line_21813'>  And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:</a>
<a id='line_21814'>  A massy tripod for the victor lies,</a>
<a id='line_21815'>  Of twice six oxen its reputed price;</a>
<a id='line_21816'>  And next, the loser's spirits to restore,</a>
<a id='line_21817'>  A female captive, valued but at four.</a>
<a id='line_21818'>  Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop</a>
<a id='line_21819'>  When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.</a>
<a id='line_21820'>  Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,</a>
<a id='line_21821'>  Embracing rigid with implicit hands.</a>
<a id='line_21822'>  Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:</a>
<a id='line_21823'>  Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;</a>
<a id='line_21824'>  Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,</a>
<a id='line_21825'>  Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,</a>
<a id='line_21826'>  Their tops connected, but at wider space</a>
<a id='line_21827'>  Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.</a>
<a id='line_21828'>  Now to the grasp each manly body bends;</a>
<a id='line_21829'>  The humid sweat from every pore descends;</a>
<a id='line_21830'>  Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs</a>
<a id='line_21831'>  Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.</a>
<a id='line_21832'>  Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_21833'>  O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;</a>
<a id='line_21834'>  Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow</a>
<a id='line_21835'>  The watchful caution of his artful foe.</a>
<a id='line_21836'>  While the long strife even tired the lookers on,</a>
<a id='line_21837'>  Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:</a>
<a id='line_21838'>  "Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:</a>
<a id='line_21839'>  Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree."</a>
<a id='line_21840'></a>
<a id='line_21841'>  He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground</a>
<a id='line_21842'>  With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found</a>
<a id='line_21843'>  The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine</a>
<a id='line_21844'>  His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;</a>
<a id='line_21845'>  Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;</a>
<a id='line_21846'>  Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.</a>
<a id='line_21847'>  Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;</a>
<a id='line_21848'>  He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:</a>
<a id='line_21849'>  His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;</a>
<a id='line_21850'>  And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.</a>
<a id='line_21851'>  Defiled with honourable dust they roll,</a>
<a id='line_21852'>  Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:</a>
<a id='line_21853'>  Again they rage, again to combat rise;</a>
<a id='line_21854'>  When great Achilles thus divides the prize:</a>
<a id='line_21855'></a>
<a id='line_21856'>  "Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;</a>
<a id='line_21857'>  Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.</a>
<a id='line_21858'>  Ye both have won: let others who excel,</a>
<a id='line_21859'>  Now prove that prowess you have proved so well."</a>
<a id='line_21860'></a>
<a id='line_21861'>  The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,</a>
<a id='line_21862'>  From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,</a>
<a id='line_21863'>  And, clothed anew, the following games survey.</a>
<a id='line_21864'></a>
<a id='line_21865'>  And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace</a>
<a id='line_21866'>  The youths contending in the rapid race:</a>
<a id='line_21867'>  A silver urn that full six measures held,</a>
<a id='line_21868'>  By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:</a>
<a id='line_21869'>  Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,</a>
<a id='line_21870'>  Elaborate, with artifice divine;</a>
<a id='line_21871'>  Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,</a>
<a id='line_21872'>  And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:</a>
<a id='line_21873'>  From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd</a>
<a id='line_21874'>  The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,</a>
<a id='line_21875'>  To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:</a>
<a id='line_21876'>  Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,</a>
<a id='line_21877'>  It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.</a>
<a id='line_21878'>  A well-fed ox was for the second placed;</a>
<a id='line_21879'>  And half a talent must content the last.</a>
<a id='line_21880'>  Achilles rising then bespoke the train:</a>
<a id='line_21881'>  "Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,</a>
<a id='line_21882'>  Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain."</a>
<a id='line_21883'></a>
<a id='line_21884'>  The hero said, and starting from his place,</a>
<a id='line_21885'>  Oilean Ajax rises to the race;</a>
<a id='line_21886'>  Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd</a>
<a id='line_21887'>  His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.</a>
<a id='line_21888'>  Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;</a>
<a id='line_21889'>  Pelides points the barrier with his hand;</a>
<a id='line_21890'>  All start at once; Oileus led the race;</a>
<a id='line_21891'>  The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;</a>
<a id='line_21892'>  Behind him, diligently close, he sped,</a>
<a id='line_21893'>  As closely following as the running thread</a>
<a id='line_21894'>  The spindle follows, and displays the charms</a>
<a id='line_21895'>  Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:</a>
<a id='line_21896'>  Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,</a>
<a id='line_21897'>  And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;</a>
<a id='line_21898'>  His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:</a>
<a id='line_21899'>  The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:</a>
<a id='line_21900'>  To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,</a>
<a id='line_21901'>  And send their souls before him as he flies.</a>
<a id='line_21902'>  Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,</a>
<a id='line_21903'>  The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:</a>
<a id='line_21904'>  "Assist, O goddess!" thus in thought he pray'd!</a>
<a id='line_21905'>  And present at his thought descends the maid.</a>

<a id='line_21909'>  Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain</a>
<a id='line_21910'>  (O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore</a>
<a id='line_21911'>  Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.</a>
<a id='line_21912'>  (The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,</a>
<a id='line_21913'>  Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)</a>
<a id='line_21914'>  Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,</a>
<a id='line_21915'>  Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;</a>
<a id='line_21916'>  The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,</a>
<a id='line_21917'>  And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.</a>
<a id='line_21918'>  Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,</a>
<a id='line_21919'>  The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:</a>
<a id='line_21920'></a>
<a id='line_21921'>  "Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;</a>
<a id='line_21922'>  A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;</a>
<a id='line_21923'>  She urged her favourite on the rapid way,</a>
<a id='line_21924'>  And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day."</a>
<a id='line_21925'></a>
<a id='line_21926'>  Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;</a>
<a id='line_21927'>  A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.</a>
<a id='line_21928'>  Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,</a>
<a id='line_21929'>  Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:</a>
<a id='line_21930'></a>
<a id='line_21931'>  "Why with our wiser elders should we strive?</a>
<a id='line_21932'>  The gods still love them, and they always thrive.</a>
<a id='line_21933'>  Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:</a>
<a id='line_21934'>  He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;</a>
<a id='line_21935'>  (A green old age unconscious of decays,</a>
<a id='line_21936'>  That proves the hero born in better days!)</a>
<a id='line_21937'>  Behold his vigour in this active race!</a>
<a id='line_21938'>  Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:</a>
<a id='line_21939'>  For who can match Achilles? He who can,</a>
<a id='line_21940'>  Must yet be more than hero, more than man."</a>
<a id='line_21941'></a>
<a id='line_21942'>  The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,</a>
<a id='line_21943'>  "Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.</a>
<a id='line_21944'>  Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;</a>
<a id='line_21945'>  Receive a talent of the purest gold."</a>
<a id='line_21946'>  The youth departs content. The host admire</a>
<a id='line_21947'>  The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.</a>

<a id='line_21972'>  Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,</a>
<a id='line_21973'>  But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.</a>
<a id='line_21974'>  A furious pass the spear of Ajax made</a>
<a id='line_21975'>  Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.</a>
<a id='line_21976'>  Not thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above</a>
<a id='line_21977'>  The buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.</a>
<a id='line_21978'>  But Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,</a>
<a id='line_21979'>  Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.</a>
<a id='line_21980'>  Yet still the victor's due Tydides gains,</a>
<a id='line_21981'>  With him the sword and studded belt remains.</a>
<a id='line_21982'></a>

<a id='line_22094'>THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.</a>
<a id='line_22095'></a>
<a id='line_22096'>The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter sends</a>
<a id='line_22097'>Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris to</a>
<a id='line_22098'>Priam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old king,</a>
<a id='line_22099'>notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for the</a>
<a id='line_22100'>journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets forth</a>
<a id='line_22101'>in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the charge of</a>
<a id='line_22102'>Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young man, and</a>
<a id='line_22103'>conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation on the way.</a>
<a id='line_22104'>Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his feet, and begs for</a>
<a id='line_22105'>the body of his son: Achilles, moved with compassion, grants his request,</a>
<a id='line_22106'>detains him one night in his tent, and the next morning sends him home</a>
<a id='line_22107'>with the body: the Trojans run out to meet him. The lamentations of</a>
<a id='line_22108'>Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the solemnities of the funeral.</a>
<a id='line_22109'></a>
<a id='line_22110'>The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of Hector</a>
<a id='line_22111'>lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the truce</a>
<a id='line_22112'>allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp, and</a>
<a id='line_22113'>partly in Troy.</a>
<a id='line_22114'></a>
<a id='line_22115'>  Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band</a>
<a id='line_22116'>  Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,</a>
<a id='line_22117'>  All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,</a>
<a id='line_22118'>  And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.</a>
<a id='line_22119'>  Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_22120'>  His friend's dear image present to his mind,</a>
<a id='line_22121'>  Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;</a>

<a id='line_22123'>  Restless he roll'd around his weary bed,</a>
<a id='line_22124'>  And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:</a>
<a id='line_22125'>  The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,</a>
<a id='line_22126'>  That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,</a>
<a id='line_22127'>  What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,</a>
<a id='line_22128'>  What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;</a>
<a id='line_22129'>  All pass'd before him in remembrance dear,</a>
<a id='line_22130'>  Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.</a>
<a id='line_22131'>  And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,</a>
<a id='line_22132'>  Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:</a>
<a id='line_22133'>  Then starting up, disconsolate he goes</a>
<a id='line_22134'>  Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.</a>
<a id='line_22135'>  There as the solitary mourner raves,</a>
<a id='line_22136'>  The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves:</a>
<a id='line_22137'>  Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!</a>
<a id='line_22138'>  The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.</a>
<a id='line_22139'>  And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument</a>
<a id='line_22140'>  Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.</a>
<a id='line_22141'>  There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes;</a>
<a id='line_22142'>  While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,</a>
<a id='line_22143'>  But not deserted by the pitying skies:</a>
<a id='line_22144'>  For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care,</a>
<a id='line_22145'>  Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;</a>
<a id='line_22146'>  And, ignominious as it swept the field,</a>
<a id='line_22147'>  Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.</a>
<a id='line_22148'>  All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go</a>
<a id='line_22149'>  By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:</a>
<a id='line_22150'>  But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,</a>
<a id='line_22151'>  And th' unrelenting empress of the skies,</a>

<a id='line_22651'>  To serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.</a>
<a id='line_22652'>  To watch this quarter, my adventure falls:</a>
<a id='line_22653'>  For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;</a>
<a id='line_22654'>  Sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,</a>
<a id='line_22655'>  And scarce their rulers check their martial rage."</a>
<a id='line_22656'></a>
<a id='line_22657'>  "If then thou art of stern Pelides' train,</a>
<a id='line_22658'>  (The mournful monarch thus rejoin'd again,)</a>
<a id='line_22659'>  Ah tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid</a>
<a id='line_22660'>  My son's dear relics? what befals him dead?</a>
<a id='line_22661'>  Have dogs dismember'd (on the naked plains),</a>

<a id='line_22663'></a>
<a id='line_22664'>  "O favour'd of the skies! (thus answered then</a>

<a id='line_22666'>  Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent,</a>
<a id='line_22667'>  But whole he lies, neglected in the tent:</a>
<a id='line_22668'>  This the twelfth evening since he rested there,</a>
<a id='line_22669'>  Untouch'd by worms, untainted by the air.</a>
<a id='line_22670'>  Still as Aurora's ruddy beam is spread,</a>
<a id='line_22671'>  Round his friend's tomb Achilles drags the dead:</a>
<a id='line_22672'>  Yet undisfigured, or in limb or face,</a>

<a id='line_22678'>  Or all the host of heaven, to whom he led</a>
<a id='line_22679'>  A life so grateful, still regard him dead."</a>
<a id='line_22680'></a>
<a id='line_22681'>  Thus spoke to Priam the celestial guide,</a>
<a id='line_22682'>  And joyful thus the royal sire replied:</a>

<a id='line_22692'>  Safe to Pelides' tent conduct my way."</a>
<a id='line_22693'></a>
<a id='line_22694'>  To whom the latent god: "O king, forbear</a>

<a id='line_22696'>  But can I, absent from my prince's sight,</a>

<a id='line_22702'>  Thee, far as Argos, pleased I could convey;</a>
<a id='line_22703'>  Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way:</a>
<a id='line_22704'>  On thee attend, thy safety to maintain,</a>
<a id='line_22705'>  O'er pathless forests, or the roaring main."</a>
<a id='line_22706'></a>
<a id='line_22707'>  He said, then took the chariot at a bound,</a>
<a id='line_22708'>  And snatch'd the reins, and whirl'd the lash around:</a>
<a id='line_22709'>  Before the inspiring god that urged them on,</a>
<a id='line_22710'>  The coursers fly with spirit not their own.</a>
<a id='line_22711'>  And now they reach'd the naval walls, and found</a>
<a id='line_22712'>  The guards repasting, while the bowls go round;</a>
<a id='line_22713'>  On these the virtue of his wand he tries,</a>
<a id='line_22714'>  And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:</a>
<a id='line_22715'>  Then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,</a>
<a id='line_22716'>  And o'er the trenches led the rolling cars.</a>
<a id='line_22717'>  Unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,</a>
<a id='line_22718'>  And now approach'd Pelides' lofty tent.</a>
<a id='line_22719'>  On firs the roof was raised, and cover'd o'er</a>
<a id='line_22720'>  With reeds collected from the marshy shore;</a>
<a id='line_22721'>  And, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,</a>
<a id='line_22722'>  (The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat.</a>
<a id='line_22723'>  Large was the door, whose well-compacted strength</a>
<a id='line_22724'>  A solid pine-tree barr'd of wondrous length:</a>
<a id='line_22725'>  Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight,</a>
<a id='line_22726'>  But great Achilles singly closed the gate.</a>
<a id='line_22727'>  This Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;</a>
<a id='line_22728'>  Then swift alighted the celestial guide,</a>
<a id='line_22729'>  And thus reveal'd--"Hear, prince! and understand</a>

<a id='line_22740'></a>
<a id='line_22741'>  Thus having said, he vanish'd from his eyes,</a>

<a id='line_22747'>  There sat the hero: Alcimus the brave,</a>
<a id='line_22748'>  And great Automedon, attendance gave:</a>
<a id='line_22749'>  These served his person at the royal feast;</a>
<a id='line_22750'>  Around, at awful distance, stood the rest.</a>
<a id='line_22751'></a>
<a id='line_22752'>  Unseen by these, the king his entry made:</a>

<a id='line_22754'>  Sudden (a venerable sight!) appears;</a>
<a id='line_22755'>  Embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;</a>

<a id='line_22757'>  Even with the best, the dearest of his blood!</a>
<a id='line_22758'></a>
<a id='line_22759'>  As when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,</a>

<a id='line_22761'>  Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,</a>
<a id='line_22762'>  All gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:</a>

<a id='line_22764'>  All mute, yet seem'd to question with their eyes:</a>
<a id='line_22765'>  Each look'd on other, none the silence broke,</a>
<a id='line_22766'>  Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:</a>

<a id='line_22774'>  Yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate</a>

<a id='line_22790'>  Him too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,</a>

<a id='line_23117'>  Condemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord:</a>
<a id='line_23118'>  Or else some Greek whose father press'd the plain,</a>
<a id='line_23119'>  Or son, or brother, by great Hector slain,</a>
<a id='line_23120'>  In Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,</a>
<a id='line_23121'>  And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.(297)</a>
<a id='line_23122'>  For thy stern father never spared a foe:</a>
<a id='line_23123'>  Thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!</a>
<a id='line_23124'>  Thence many evils his sad parents bore,</a>
<a id='line_23125'>  His parents many, but his consort more.</a>
<a id='line_23126'>  Why gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?</a>
<a id='line_23127'>  And why received not I thy last command?</a>
<a id='line_23128'>  Some word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,</a>
<a id='line_23129'>  My soul might keep, or utter with a tear;</a>
<a id='line_23130'>  Which never, never could be lost in air,</a>
<a id='line_23131'>  Fix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!"</a>
<a id='line_23132'></a>
<a id='line_23133'>  Thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,</a>
<a id='line_23134'>  Her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.</a>
<a id='line_23135'></a>
<a id='line_23136'>  The mournful mother next sustains her part:</a>
<a id='line_23137'>  "O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!</a>
<a id='line_23138'>  Of all my race thou most by heaven approved,</a>
<a id='line_23139'>  And by the immortals even in death beloved!</a>
<a id='line_23140'>  While all my other sons in barbarous bands</a>
<a id='line_23141'>  Achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,</a>
<a id='line_23142'>  This felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,</a>
<a id='line_23143'>  Free, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.</a>
<a id='line_23144'>  Sentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,</a>
<a id='line_23145'>  Thy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb;</a>
<a id='line_23146'>  (The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)</a>
<a id='line_23147'>  Ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!</a>
<a id='line_23148'>  Yet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace;</a>
<a id='line_23149'>  No mark of pain, or violence of face:</a>
<a id='line_23150'>  Rosy and fair! as Phoebus' silver bow</a>
<a id='line_23151'>  Dismiss'd thee gently to the shades below."</a>
<a id='line_23152'></a>
<a id='line_23153'>  Thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.</a>
<a id='line_23154'>  Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;</a>
<a id='line_23155'>  Fast from the shining sluices of her eyes</a>
<a id='line_23156'>  Fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.</a>
<a id='line_23157'></a>
<a id='line_23158'>  "Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd(298)</a>
<a id='line_23159'>  Tne mildest manners with the bravest mind,</a>
<a id='line_23160'>  Now twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er</a>
<a id='line_23161'>  Since Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,</a>
<a id='line_23162'>  (O had I perish'd, ere that form divine</a>
<a id='line_23163'>  Seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)</a>
<a id='line_23164'>  Yet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find</a>
<a id='line_23165'>  A deed ungentle, or a word unkind.</a>
<a id='line_23166'>  When others cursed the authoress of their woe,</a>
<a id='line_23167'>  Thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.</a>
<a id='line_23168'>  If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,</a>
<a id='line_23169'>  Or scornful sister with her sweeping train,</a>
<a id='line_23170'>  Thy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.</a>
<a id='line_23171'>  For thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,</a>
<a id='line_23172'>  The wretched source of all this misery.</a>
<a id='line_23173'>  The fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;</a>
<a id='line_23174'>  Sad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!</a>
<a id='line_23175'>  Through Troy's wide streets abandon'd shall I roam!</a>
<a id='line_23176'>  In Troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!"</a>
<a id='line_23177'></a>
<a id='line_23178'>  So spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.</a>
<a id='line_23179'>  Distressful beauty melts each stander-by.</a>
<a id='line_23180'>  On all around the infectious sorrow grows;</a>
<a id='line_23181'>  But Priam check'd the torrent as it rose:</a>
<a id='line_23182'>  "Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,</a>

<a id='line_23184'>  Twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;</a>
<a id='line_23185'>  Achilles grants these honours to the dead."(299)</a>

<a id='line_23187'>                    [Illustration: FUNERAL OF HECTOR.]</a>

<a id='line_23192'>  He spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train</a>
<a id='line_23193'>  Their mules and oxen harness to the wain,</a>

<a id='line_23199'>  Forth to the pile was borne the man divine,</a>
<a id='line_23200'>  And placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,</a>
<a id='line_23201'>  Beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.</a>
<a id='line_23202'>  Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,</a>

<a id='line_23206'>  The snowy bones his friends and brothers place</a>
<a id='line_23207'>  (With tears collected) in a golden vase;</a>
<a id='line_23208'>  The golden vase in purple palls they roll'd,</a>

<a id='line_23212'>  (Strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,</a>

<a id='line_23224'></a>
<a id='line_23225'>CONCLUDING NOTE.</a>
<a id='line_23226'></a>
<a id='line_23227'></a>
<a id='line_23228'>We have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles, and</a>
<a id='line_23229'>the terrible effects of it, at an end, as that only was the subject of the</a>
<a id='line_23230'>poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed</a>
<a id='line_23231'>to the event of the war, it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader</a>
<a id='line_23232'>to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in</a>
<a id='line_23233'>this poem after the conclusion of it.</a>
<a id='line_23234'></a>
<a id='line_23235'>I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector by</a>
<a id='line_23236'>the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are described</a>
<a id='line_23237'>by Virgil in the second book of the AEneid.</a>
<a id='line_23238'></a>
<a id='line_23239'>Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an arrow</a>
<a id='line_23240'>in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, lib. xxii.</a>
<a id='line_23241'></a>
<a id='line_23242'>The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.</a>
<a id='line_23243'></a>
<a id='line_23244'>Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the</a>
<a id='line_23245'>armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself through</a>
<a id='line_23246'>indignation.</a>
<a id='line_23247'></a>
<a id='line_23248'>Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his brother, and at the</a>
<a id='line_23249'>taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to Menelaus her</a>
<a id='line_23250'>first husband, who received her again into favour.</a>
<a id='line_23251'></a>
<a id='line_23252'>Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by AEgysthus, at the</a>
<a id='line_23253'>instigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who in his absence had dishonoured</a>
<a id='line_23254'>his bed with AEgysthus.</a>
<a id='line_23255'></a>
<a id='line_23256'>Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and scarce</a>
<a id='line_23257'>escaped with his life from his adulterous wife AEgiale; but at last was</a>
<a id='line_23258'>received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is uncertain how</a>
<a id='line_23259'>he died.</a>
<a id='line_23260'></a>
<a id='line_23261'>Nestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.</a>
<a id='line_23262'></a>
<a id='line_23263'>Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last returned</a>
<a id='line_23264'>in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's Odyssey.</a>
<a id='line_23265'></a>
<a id='line_23266'>For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave</a>
<a id='line_23267'>at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others, with any</a>
<a id='line_23268'>defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to raise a</a>
<a id='line_23269'>vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it (which must</a>
<a id='line_23270'>be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me leave behind me</a>
<a id='line_23271'>a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men, as well</a>
<a id='line_23272'>as finest writers, of my age and country, one who has tried, and knows by</a>
<a id='line_23273'>his own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer,</a>
<a id='line_23274'>and one whom (I am sure) sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my</a>
<a id='line_23275'>labours. To him, therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion,</a>
<a id='line_23276'>I desire to dedicate it, and to have the honour and satisfaction of</a>
<a id='line_23277'>placing together, in this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of</a>
