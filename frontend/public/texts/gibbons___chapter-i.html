<a id='line_3'>      Introduction.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>     The Extent And Military Force Of The Empire In The Age Of The</a>
<a id='line_6'>     Antonines.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      In the second century of the Christian Æra, the empire of Rome</a>
<a id='line_9'>      comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most</a>
<a id='line_10'>      civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive</a>
<a id='line_11'>      monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valor.</a>
<a id='line_12'>      The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had</a>
<a id='line_13'>      gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful</a>
<a id='line_14'>      inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and</a>
<a id='line_15'>      luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with</a>
<a id='line_16'>      decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      executive powers of government. During a happy period of more</a>
<a id='line_19'>      than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by</a>
<a id='line_20'>      the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Antonines. It is the design of this, and of the two succeeding</a>
<a id='line_22'>      chapters, to describe the prosperous condition of their empire;</a>
<a id='line_23'>      and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a</a>
<a id='line_25'>      revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the nations of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>      The principal conquests of the Romans were achieved under the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      republic; and the emperors, for the most part, were satisfied</a>
<a id='line_30'>      with preserving those dominions which had been acquired by the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      policy of the senate, the active emulations of the consuls, and</a>
<a id='line_32'>      the martial enthusiasm of the people. The seven first centuries</a>
<a id='line_33'>      were filled with a rapid succession of triumphs; but it was</a>
<a id='line_34'>      reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of</a>
<a id='line_35'>      subduing the whole earth, and to introduce a spirit of moderation</a>
<a id='line_36'>      into the public councils. Inclined to peace by his temper and</a>
<a id='line_37'>      situation, it was easy for him to discover that Rome, in her</a>
<a id='line_38'>      present exalted situation, had much less to hope than to fear</a>
<a id='line_39'>      from the chance of arms; and that, in the prosecution of remote</a>
<a id='line_40'>      wars, the undertaking became every day more difficult, the event</a>
<a id='line_41'>      more doubtful, and the possession more precarious, and less</a>
<a id='line_42'>      beneficial. The experience of Augustus added weight to these</a>
<a id='line_43'>      salutary reflections, and effectually convinced him that, by the</a>
<a id='line_44'>      prudent vigor of his counsels, it would be easy to secure every</a>
<a id='line_45'>      concession which the safety or the dignity of Rome might require</a>
<a id='line_46'>      from the most formidable barbarians. Instead of exposing his</a>
<a id='line_47'>      person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians, he</a>
<a id='line_48'>      obtained, by an honorable treaty, the restitution of the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      standards and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of</a>
<a id='line_50'>      Crassus. 1a</a>

<a id='line_55'>      own exploits, asserted that _he compelled_ the Parthians to</a>
<a id='line_56'>      restore the ensigns of Crassus.]</a>

<a id='line_58'>      His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      reduction of Ethiopia and Arabia Felix. They marched near a</a>
<a id='line_60'>      thousand miles to the south of the tropic; but the heat of the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      climate soon repelled the invaders, and protected the un-warlike</a>
<a id='line_62'>      natives of those sequestered regions. 2c The northern countries</a>
<a id='line_63'>      of Europe scarcely deserved the expense and labor of conquest.</a>
<a id='line_64'>      The forests and morasses of Germany were filled with a hardy race</a>
<a id='line_65'>      of barbarians, who despised life when it was separated from</a>
<a id='line_66'>      freedom; and though, on the first attack, they seemed to yield to</a>
<a id='line_67'>      the weight of the Roman power, they soon, by a signal act of</a>
<a id='line_68'>      despair, regained their independence, and reminded Augustus of</a>
<a id='line_69'>      the vicissitude of fortune. 3a On the death of that emperor, his</a>
<a id='line_70'>      testament was publicly read in the senate. He bequeathed, as a</a>
<a id='line_71'>      valuable legacy to his successors, the advice of confining the</a>
<a id='line_72'>      empire within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as</a>
<a id='line_73'>      its permanent bulwarks and boundaries: on the west, the Atlantic</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the Euphrates on the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      east; and towards the south, the sandy deserts of Arabia and</a>
<a id='line_76'>      Africa. 4a</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>      2c (return) [ Strabo, (l. xvi. p. 780,) Pliny the elder, (Hist.</a>

<a id='line_80'>      p. 723, and l. liv. p. 734,) have left us very curious details</a>
<a id='line_81'>      concerning these wars. The Romans made themselves masters of</a>
<a id='line_82'>      Mariaba, or Merab, a city of Arabia Felix, well known to the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      Orientals. (See Abulfeda and the Nubian geography, p. 52) They</a>
<a id='line_84'>      were arrived within three days’ journey of the spice country, the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      rich object of their invasion.</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>      Note: It is this city of Merab that the Arabs say was the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      residence of Belkis, queen of Saba, who desired to see Solomon. A</a>
<a id='line_89'>      dam, by which the waters collected in its neighborhood were kept</a>
<a id='line_90'>      back, having been swept away, the sudden inundation destroyed</a>
<a id='line_91'>      this city, of which, nevertheless, vestiges remain. It bordered</a>
<a id='line_92'>      on a country called Adramout, where a particular aromatic plant</a>
<a id='line_93'>      grows: it is for this reason that we real in the history of the</a>
<a id='line_94'>      Roman expedition, that they were arrived within three days’</a>

<a id='line_96'>      Eng. trans. vol. ii. p. 215. The period of this flood has been</a>
<a id='line_97'>      copiously discussed by Reiske, (_Program. de vetustâ Epochâ</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Arabum, rupturâ cataractæ Merabensis_.) Add. Johannsen, _Hist.</a>

<a id='line_102'>      Note: Two, according to Strabo. The detailed account of Strabo</a>
<a id='line_103'>      makes the invaders fail before Marsuabæ this cannot be the same</a>
<a id='line_104'>      place as Mariaba. Ukert observes, that Ælius Gallus would not</a>
<a id='line_105'>      have failed for want of water before Mariaba. (See M. Guizot’s</a>
<a id='line_106'>      note above.) “Either, therefore, they were different places, or</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Strabo is mistaken.” (Ukert, _Geographie der Griechen und Römer_,</a>
<a id='line_108'>      vol. i. p. 181.) Strabo, indeed, mentions Mariaba distinct from</a>
<a id='line_109'>      Marsuabæ. Gibbon has followed Pliny in reckoning Mariaba among</a>
<a id='line_110'>      the conquests of Gallus. There can be little doubt that he is</a>
<a id='line_111'>      wrong, as Gallus did not approach the capital of Sabæa. Compare</a>

<a id='line_125'>      Happily for the repose of mankind, the moderate system</a>
<a id='line_126'>      recommended by the wisdom of Augustus, was adopted by the fears</a>
<a id='line_127'>      and vices of his immediate successors. Engaged in the pursuit of</a>
<a id='line_128'>      pleasure, or in the exercise of tyranny, the first Cæsars seldom</a>
<a id='line_129'>      showed themselves to the armies, or to the provinces; nor were</a>
<a id='line_130'>      they disposed to suffer, that those triumphs which _their_</a>
<a id='line_131'>      indolence neglected, should be usurped by the conduct and valor</a>
<a id='line_132'>      of their lieutenants. The military fame of a subject was</a>
<a id='line_133'>      considered as an insolent invasion of the Imperial prerogative;</a>
<a id='line_134'>      and it became the duty, as well as interest, of every Roman</a>
<a id='line_135'>      general, to guard the frontiers intrusted to his care, without</a>
<a id='line_136'>      aspiring to conquests which might have proved no less fatal to</a>

<a id='line_142'>      Tacitus, was, in the strictest sense of the word, _imperatoria</a>
<a id='line_143'>      virtus_.]</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>      The only accession which the Roman empire received, during the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      first century of the Christian Æra, was the province of Britain.</a>
<a id='line_147'>      In this single instance, the successors of Cæsar and Augustus</a>
<a id='line_148'>      were persuaded to follow the example of the former, rather than</a>
<a id='line_149'>      the precept of the latter. The proximity of its situation to the</a>
<a id='line_150'>      coast of Gaul seemed to invite their arms; the pleasing though</a>
<a id='line_151'>      doubtful intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice;</a>
<a id='line_152'>      6 and as Britain was viewed in the light of a distinct and</a>
<a id='line_153'>      insulated world, the conquest scarcely formed any exception to</a>
<a id='line_154'>      the general system of continental measures. After a war of about</a>
<a id='line_155'>      forty years, undertaken by the most stupid, 7 maintained by the</a>
<a id='line_156'>      most dissolute, and terminated by the most timid of all the</a>
<a id='line_157'>      emperors, the far greater part of the island submitted to the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      Roman yoke. 8 The various tribes of Britain possessed valor</a>
<a id='line_159'>      without conduct, and the love of freedom without the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_160'>      union. They took up arms with savage fierceness; they laid them</a>
<a id='line_161'>      down, or turned them against each other, with wild inconsistency;</a>
<a id='line_162'>      and while they fought singly, they were successively subdued.</a>
<a id='line_163'>      Neither the fortitude of Caractacus, nor the despair of Boadicea,</a>
<a id='line_164'>      nor the fanaticism of the Druids, could avert the slavery of</a>
<a id='line_165'>      their country, or resist the steady progress of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_166'>      generals, who maintained the national glory, when the throne was</a>
<a id='line_167'>      disgraced by the weakest, or the most vicious of mankind. At the</a>
<a id='line_168'>      very time when Domitian, confined to his palace, felt the terrors</a>
<a id='line_169'>      which he inspired, his legions, under the command of the virtuous</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Agricola, defeated the collected force of the Caledonians, at the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      foot of the Grampian Hills; and his fleets, venturing to explore</a>
<a id='line_172'>      an unknown and dangerous navigation, displayed the Roman arms</a>
<a id='line_173'>      round every part of the island. The conquest of Britain was</a>
<a id='line_174'>      considered as already achieved; and it was the design of Agricola</a>
<a id='line_175'>      to complete and insure his success, by the easy reduction of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Ireland, for which, in his opinion, one legion and a few</a>
<a id='line_177'>      auxiliaries were sufficient. 9 The western isle might be improved</a>
<a id='line_178'>      into a valuable possession, and the Britons would wear their</a>
<a id='line_179'>      chains with the less reluctance, if the prospect and example of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      freedom were on every side removed from before their eyes.</a>

<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>      But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his removal</a>
<a id='line_205'>      from the government of Britain; and forever disappointed this</a>
<a id='line_206'>      rational, though extensive scheme of conquest. Before his</a>
<a id='line_207'>      departure, the prudent general had provided for security as well</a>
<a id='line_208'>      as for dominion. He had observed, that the island is almost</a>
<a id='line_209'>      divided into two unequal parts by the opposite gulfs, or, as they</a>
<a id='line_210'>      are now called, the Friths of Scotland. Across the narrow</a>
<a id='line_211'>      interval of about forty miles, he had drawn a line of military</a>
<a id='line_212'>      stations, which was afterwards fortified, in the reign of</a>
<a id='line_213'>      Antoninus Pius, by a turf rampart, erected on foundations of</a>
<a id='line_214'>      stone. 10 This wall of Antoninus, at a small distance beyond the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      modern cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, was fixed as the limit of</a>
<a id='line_216'>      the Roman province. The native Caledonians preserved, in the</a>
<a id='line_217'>      northern extremity of the island, their wild independence, for</a>
<a id='line_218'>      which they were not less indebted to their poverty than to their</a>
<a id='line_219'>      valor. Their incursions were frequently repelled and chastised;</a>
<a id='line_220'>      but their country was never subdued. 11 The masters of the</a>

<a id='line_258'>      scenes of war and conquest; and the legions, after a long</a>
<a id='line_259'>      interval, beheld a military emperor at their head. The first</a>
<a id='line_260'>      exploits of Trajan were against the Dacians, the most warlike of</a>
<a id='line_261'>      men, who dwelt beyond the Danube, and who, during the reign of</a>
<a id='line_262'>      Domitian, had insulted, with impunity, the Majesty of Rome. 14 To</a>
<a id='line_263'>      the strength and fierceness of barbarians they added a contempt</a>
<a id='line_264'>      for life, which was derived from a warm persuasion of the</a>
<a id='line_265'>      immortality and transmigration of the soul. 15 Decebalus, the</a>
<a id='line_266'>      Dacian king, approved himself a rival not unworthy of Trajan; nor</a>
<a id='line_267'>      did he despair of his own and the public fortune, till, by the</a>
<a id='line_268'>      confession of his enemies, he had exhausted every resource both</a>
<a id='line_269'>      of valor and policy. 16 This memorable war, with a very short</a>
<a id='line_270'>      suspension of hostilities, lasted five years; and as the emperor</a>
<a id='line_271'>      could exert, without control, the whole force of the state, it</a>
<a id='line_272'>      was terminated by an absolute submission of the barbarians. 17</a>
<a id='line_273'>      The new province of Dacia, which formed a second exception to the</a>

<a id='line_276'>      or Tibiscus, the Lower Danube, and the Euxine Sea. The vestiges</a>
<a id='line_277'>      of a military road may still be traced from the banks of the</a>

<a id='line_303'>      Alexander, transmitted by a succession of poets and historians,</a>
<a id='line_304'>      had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of Trajan. Like</a>
<a id='line_305'>      him, the Roman emperor undertook an expedition against the</a>
<a id='line_306'>      nations of the East; but he lamented with a sigh, that his</a>
<a id='line_307'>      advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown</a>
<a id='line_308'>      of the son of Philip. 19 Yet the success of Trajan, however</a>
<a id='line_309'>      transient, was rapid and specious. The degenerate Parthians,</a>
<a id='line_310'>      broken by intestine discord, fled before his arms. He descended</a>

<a id='line_314'>      sea. His fleets ravaged the coast of Arabia; and Trajan vainly</a>

<a id='line_316'>      India. 20 Every day the astonished senate received the</a>

<a id='line_319'>      Iberia, Albania, Osrhoene, and even the Parthian monarch himself,</a>
<a id='line_320'>      had accepted their diadems from the hands of the emperor; that</a>

<a id='line_323'>      Mesopotamia, and Assyria, were reduced into the state of</a>
<a id='line_324'>      provinces. 21 But the death of Trajan soon clouded the splendid</a>

<a id='line_344'>      It was an ancient tradition, that when the Capitol was founded by</a>
<a id='line_345'>      one of the Roman kings, the god Terminus (who presided over</a>
<a id='line_346'>      boundaries, and was represented, according to the fashion of that</a>
<a id='line_347'>      age, by a large stone) alone, among all the inferior deities,</a>
<a id='line_348'>      refused to yield his place to Jupiter himself. A favorable</a>
<a id='line_349'>      inference was drawn from his obstinacy, which was interpreted by</a>
<a id='line_350'>      the augurs as a sure presage that the boundaries of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_351'>      power would never recede. 22 During many ages, the prediction, as</a>
<a id='line_352'>      it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment. But though</a>
<a id='line_353'>      Terminus had resisted the Majesty of Jupiter, he submitted to the</a>
<a id='line_354'>      authority of the emperor Hadrian. 23 The resignation of all the</a>
<a id='line_355'>      eastern conquests of Trajan was the first measure of his reign.</a>
<a id='line_356'>      He restored to the Parthians the election of an independent</a>
<a id='line_357'>      sovereign; withdrew the Roman garrisons from the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_358'>      Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria; and, in compliance with the</a>
<a id='line_359'>      precept of Augustus, once more established the Euphrates as the</a>
<a id='line_360'>      frontier of the empire. 24 Censure, which arraigns the public</a>

<a id='line_362'>      a conduct which might be attributed to the prudence and</a>
<a id='line_363'>      moderation of Hadrian. The various character of that emperor,</a>

<a id='line_365'>      sentiments, may afford some color to the suspicion. It was,</a>
<a id='line_366'>      however, scarcely in his power to place the superiority of his</a>

<a id='line_524'>      disgrace on the company, the legion, or even the army, to whose</a>
<a id='line_525'>      honors he was associated. On his first entrance into the service,</a>
<a id='line_526'>      an oath was administered to him with every circumstance of</a>
<a id='line_527'>      solemnity. He promised never to desert his standard, to submit</a>
<a id='line_528'>      his own will to the commands of his leaders, and to sacrifice his</a>
<a id='line_529'>      life for the safety of the emperor and the empire. 33 The</a>
<a id='line_530'>      attachment of the Roman troops to their standards was inspired by</a>
<a id='line_531'>      the united influence of religion and of honor. The golden eagle,</a>
<a id='line_532'>      which glittered in the front of the legion, was the object of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      their fondest devotion; nor was it esteemed less impious than it</a>
<a id='line_534'>      was ignominious, to abandon that sacred ensign in the hour of</a>
<a id='line_535'>      danger. 34 These motives, which derived their strength from the</a>
<a id='line_536'>      imagination, were enforced by fears and hopes of a more</a>
<a id='line_537'>      substantial kind. Regular pay, occasional donatives, and a stated</a>
<a id='line_538'>      recompense, after the appointed time of service, alleviated the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      hardships of the military life, 35 whilst, on the other hand, it</a>
<a id='line_540'>      was impossible for cowardice or disobedience to escape the</a>
<a id='line_541'>      severest punishment. The centurions were authorized to chastise</a>
<a id='line_542'>      with blows, the generals had a right to punish with death; and it</a>
<a id='line_543'>      was an inflexible maxim of Roman discipline, that a good soldier</a>

<a id='line_630'></a>
<a id='line_631'>      Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced into the service</a>
<a id='line_632'>      many alterations and improvements. The legions, as they are</a>
<a id='line_633'>      described by Polybius, 41 in the time of the Punic wars, differed</a>
<a id='line_634'>      very materially from those which achieved the victories of Cæsar,</a>
<a id='line_635'>      or defended the monarchy of Hadrian and the Antonines. The</a>
<a id='line_636'>      constitution of the Imperial legion may be described in a few</a>
<a id='line_637'>      words. 42 The heavy-armed infantry, which composed its principal</a>
<a id='line_638'>      strength, 43 was divided into ten cohorts, and fifty-five</a>
<a id='line_639'>      companies, under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes</a>
<a id='line_640'>      and centurions. The first cohort, which always claimed the post</a>
<a id='line_641'>      of honor and the custody of the eagle, was formed of eleven</a>
<a id='line_642'>      hundred and five soldiers, the most approved for valor and</a>
<a id='line_643'>      fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts consisted each of five</a>
<a id='line_644'>      hundred and fifty-five; and the whole body of legionary infantry</a>
<a id='line_645'>      amounted to six thousand one hundred men. Their arms were</a>
<a id='line_646'>      uniform, and admirably adapted to the nature of their service: an</a>
<a id='line_647'>      open helmet, with a lofty crest; a breastplate, or coat of mail;</a>
<a id='line_648'>      greaves on their legs, and an ample buckler on their left arm.</a>
<a id='line_649'>      The buckler was of an oblong and concave figure, four feet in</a>
<a id='line_650'>      length, and two and a half in breadth, framed of a light wood,</a>
<a id='line_651'>      covered with a bull’s hide, and strongly guarded with plates of</a>
<a id='line_652'>      brass. Besides a lighter spear, the legionary soldier grasped in</a>
<a id='line_653'>      his right hand the formidable _pilum_, a ponderous javelin, whose</a>
<a id='line_654'>      utmost length was about six feet, and which was terminated by a</a>
<a id='line_655'>      massy triangular point of steel of eighteen inches. 44 This</a>
<a id='line_656'>      instrument was indeed much inferior to our modern fire-arms;</a>
<a id='line_657'>      since it was exhausted by a single discharge, at the distance of</a>
<a id='line_658'>      only ten or twelve paces. Yet when it was launched by a firm and</a>
<a id='line_659'>      skilful hand, there was not any cavalry that durst venture within</a>
<a id='line_660'>      its reach, nor any shield or corselet that could sustain the</a>
<a id='line_661'>      impetuosity of its weight. As soon as the Roman had darted his</a>
<a id='line_662'>      _pilum_, he drew his sword, and rushed forwards to close with the</a>
<a id='line_663'>      enemy. His sword was a short well-tempered Spanish blade, that</a>
<a id='line_664'>      carried a double edge, and was alike suited to the purpose of</a>
<a id='line_665'>      striking or of pushing; but the soldier was always instructed to</a>
<a id='line_666'>      prefer the latter use of his weapon, as his own body remained</a>
<a id='line_667'>      less exposed, whilst he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his</a>
<a id='line_668'>      adversary. 45 The legion was usually drawn up eight deep; and the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      regular distance of three feet was left between the files as well</a>
<a id='line_670'>      as ranks. 46 A body of troops, habituated to preserve this open</a>
<a id='line_671'>      order, in a long front and a rapid charge, found themselves</a>
<a id='line_672'>      prepared to execute every disposition which the circumstances of</a>
<a id='line_673'>      war, or the skill of their leader, might suggest. The soldier</a>
<a id='line_674'>      possessed a free space for his arms and motions, and sufficient</a>
<a id='line_675'>      intervals were allowed, through which seasonable reinforcements</a>
<a id='line_676'>      might be introduced to the relief of the exhausted combatants. 47</a>
<a id='line_677'>      The tactics of the Greeks and Macedonians were formed on very</a>
<a id='line_678'>      different principles. The strength of the phalanx depended on</a>
<a id='line_679'>      sixteen ranks of long pikes, wedged together in the closest</a>
<a id='line_680'>      array. 48 But it was soon discovered by reflection, as well as by</a>

<a id='line_776'>      that young knights were made tribunes immediately on entering the</a>
<a id='line_777'>      service, proves nothing. In the first place, Horace was not a</a>
<a id='line_778'>      knight; he was the son of a freedman of Venusia, in Apulia, who</a>
<a id='line_779'>      exercised the humble office of coactor exauctionum, (collector of</a>
<a id='line_780'>      payments at auctions.) (Sat. i. vi. 45, or 86.) Moreover, when</a>
<a id='line_781'>      the poet was made tribune, Brutus, whose army was nearly entirely</a>
<a id='line_782'>      composed of Orientals, gave this title to all the Romans of</a>
<a id='line_783'>      consideration who joined him. The emperors were still less</a>
<a id='line_784'>      difficult in their choice; the number of tribunes was augmented;</a>
<a id='line_785'>      the title and honors were conferred on persons whom they wished</a>
<a id='line_786'>      to attack to the court. Augustus conferred on the sons of</a>
<a id='line_787'>      senators, sometimes the tribunate, sometimes the command of a</a>
<a id='line_788'>      squadron. Claudius gave to the knights who entered into the</a>
<a id='line_789'>      service, first the command of a cohort of auxiliaries, later that</a>
<a id='line_790'>      of a squadron, and at length, for the first time, the tribunate.</a>

<a id='line_805'>      The safety and honor of the empire was principally intrusted to</a>
<a id='line_806'>      the legions, but the policy of Rome condescended to adopt every</a>
<a id='line_807'>      useful instrument of war. Considerable levies were regularly made</a>
<a id='line_808'>      among the provincials, who had not yet deserved the honorable</a>
<a id='line_809'>      distinction of Romans. Many dependent princes and communities,</a>
<a id='line_810'>      dispersed round the frontiers, were permitted, for a while, to</a>
<a id='line_811'>      hold their freedom and security by the tenure of military</a>
<a id='line_812'>      service. 55 Even select troops of hostile barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_813'>      frequently compelled or persuaded to consume their dangerous</a>

<a id='line_815'>      All these were included under the general name of auxiliaries;</a>
<a id='line_816'>      and howsoever they might vary according to the difference of</a>

<a id='line_864'>      The camp of a Roman legion presented the appearance of a</a>

<a id='line_874'>      the auxiliaries occupied their respective stations; the streets</a>
<a id='line_875'>      were broad and perfectly straight, and a vacant space of two</a>
<a id='line_876'>      hundred feet was left on all sides between the tents and the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      rampart. The rampart itself was usually twelve feet high, armed</a>

<a id='line_922'>      Such were the arts of war, by which the Roman emperors defended</a>
<a id='line_923'>      their extensive conquests, and preserved a military spirit, at a</a>
<a id='line_924'>      time when every other virtue was oppressed by luxury and</a>
<a id='line_925'>      despotism. If, in the consideration of their armies, we pass from</a>
<a id='line_926'>      their discipline to their numbers, we shall not find it easy to</a>
<a id='line_927'>      define them with any tolerable accuracy. We may compute, however,</a>
<a id='line_928'>      that the legion, which was itself a body of six thousand eight</a>
<a id='line_929'>      hundred and thirty-one Romans, might, with its attendant</a>
<a id='line_930'>      auxiliaries, amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men.</a>
<a id='line_931'>      The peace establishment of Hadrian and his successors was</a>
<a id='line_932'>      composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades; and</a>
<a id='line_933'>      most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_934'>      seventy-five thousand men. Instead of being confined within the</a>
<a id='line_935'>      walls of fortified cities, which the Romans considered as the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      refuge of weakness or pusillanimity, the legions were encamped on</a>
<a id='line_937'>      the banks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the</a>
<a id='line_938'>      barbarians. As their stations, for the most part, remained fixed</a>
<a id='line_939'>      and permanent, we may venture to describe the distribution of the</a>
<a id='line_940'>      troops. Three legions were sufficient for Britain. The principal</a>
<a id='line_941'>      strength lay upon the Rhine and Danube, and consisted of sixteen</a>
<a id='line_942'>      legions, in the following proportions: two in the Lower, and</a>
<a id='line_943'>      three in the Upper Germany; one in Rhætia, one in Noricum, four</a>
<a id='line_944'>      in Pannonia, three in Mæsia, and two in Dacia. The defence of the</a>
<a id='line_945'>      Euphrates was intrusted to eight legions, six of whom were</a>
<a id='line_946'>      planted in Syria, and the other two in Cappadocia. With regard to</a>
<a id='line_947'>      Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed from any</a>
<a id='line_948'>      important scene of war, a single legion maintained the domestic</a>
<a id='line_949'>      tranquillity of each of those great provinces. Even Italy was not</a>
<a id='line_950'>      left destitute of a military force. Above twenty thousand chosen</a>
<a id='line_951'>      soldiers, distinguished by the titles of City Cohorts and</a>
<a id='line_952'>      Prætorian Guards, watched over the safety of the monarch and the</a>
<a id='line_953'>      capital. As the authors of almost every revolution that</a>
<a id='line_954'>      distracted the empire, the Prætorians will, very soon, and very</a>
<a id='line_955'>      loudly, demand our attention; but, in their arms and</a>
<a id='line_956'>      institutions, we cannot find any circumstance which discriminated</a>
<a id='line_957'>      them from the legions, unless it were a more splendid appearance,</a>
<a id='line_958'>      and a less rigid discipline. 65</a>

<a id='line_967'>      their greatness; but it was fully sufficient for every useful</a>
<a id='line_968'>      purpose of government. The ambition of the Romans was confined to</a>
<a id='line_969'>      the land; nor was that warlike people ever actuated by the</a>
<a id='line_970'>      enterprising spirit which had prompted the navigators of Tyre, of</a>
<a id='line_971'>      Carthage, and even of Marseilles, to enlarge the bounds of the</a>
<a id='line_972'>      world, and to explore the most remote coasts of the ocean. To the</a>
<a id='line_973'>      Romans the ocean remained an object of terror rather than of</a>
<a id='line_974'>      curiosity; 66 the whole extent of the Mediterranean, after the</a>
<a id='line_975'>      destruction of Carthage, and the extirpation of the pirates, was</a>
<a id='line_976'>      included within their provinces. The policy of the emperors was</a>
<a id='line_977'>      directed only to preserve the peaceful dominion of that sea, and</a>
<a id='line_978'>      to protect the commerce of their subjects. With these moderate</a>
<a id='line_979'>      views, Augustus stationed two permanent fleets in the most</a>

<a id='line_981'>      the other at Misenum, in the Bay of Naples. Experience seems at</a>
<a id='line_982'>      length to have convinced the ancients, that as soon as their</a>
<a id='line_983'>      galleys exceeded two, or at the most three ranks of oars, they</a>
<a id='line_984'>      were suited rather for vain pomp than for real service. Augustus</a>
<a id='line_985'>      himself, in the victory of Actium, had seen the superiority of</a>
<a id='line_986'>      his own light frigates (they were called Liburnians) over the</a>
<a id='line_987'>      lofty but unwieldy castles of his rival. 67 Of these Liburnians</a>
<a id='line_988'>      he composed the two fleets of Ravenna and Misenum, destined to</a>
<a id='line_989'>      command, the one the eastern, the other the western division of</a>
<a id='line_990'>      the Mediterranean; and to each of the squadrons he attached a</a>
<a id='line_991'>      body of several thousand marines. Besides these two ports, which</a>
<a id='line_992'>      may be considered as the principal seats of the Roman navy, a</a>
<a id='line_993'>      very considerable force was stationed at Frejus, on the coast of</a>
<a id='line_994'>      Provence, and the Euxine was guarded by forty ships, and three</a>
<a id='line_995'>      thousand soldiers. To all these we add the fleet which preserved</a>
<a id='line_996'>      the communication between Gaul and Britain, and a great number of</a>
<a id='line_997'>      vessels constantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube, to harass</a>

<a id='line_1337'>      The importance attached by the Romans to the conquest of</a>

<a id='line_1353'>      The Abbé Guénée, in his _Lettres de quelques Juifs à Mons. de</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      Voltaire_, has exhausted the subject of the fertility of</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      Palestine; for Voltaire had likewise indulged in sarcasm on this</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      subject. Gibbon was assailed on this point, not, indeed, by Mr.</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      Davis, who, he slyly insinuates, was prevented by his patriotism</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      as a Welshman from resenting the comparison with Wales, but by</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      other writers. In his Vindication, he first established the</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      correctness of his measurement of Palestine, which he estimates</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      as 7600 square English miles, while Wales is about 7011. As to</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      fertility, he proceeds in the following dexterously composed and</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      splendid passage: “The emperor Frederick II., the enemy and the</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      victim of the clergy, is accused of saying, after his return from</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      his crusade, that the God of the Jews would have despised his</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      promised land, if he had once seen the fruitful realms of Sicily</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      and Naples.” (See Giannone, Istor. Civ. del R. di Napoli, ii.</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      245.) This raillery, which malice has, perhaps, falsely imputed</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      to Frederick, is inconsistent with truth and piety; yet it must</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      be confessed that the soil of Palestine does not contain that</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      inexhaustible, and, as it were, spontaneous principle of</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      fertility, which, under the most unfavorable circumstances, has</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      covered with rich harvests the banks of the Nile, the fields of</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      Sicily, or the plains of Poland. The Jordan is the only navigable</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      river of Palestine: a considerable part of the narrow space is</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      occupied, or rather lost, in the _Dead Sea_ whose horrid aspect</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      inspires every sensation of disgust, and countenances every tale</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      of horror. The districts which border on Arabia partake of the</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      sandy quality of the adjacent desert. The face of the country,</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      except the sea-coast, and the valley of the Jordan, is covered</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      with mountains, which appear, for the most part, as naked and</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      barren rocks; and in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, there is a</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      real scarcity of the two elements of earth and water. (See</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      Maundrel’s Travels, p. 65, and Reland’s Palestin. i. 238, 395.)</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      These disadvantages, which now operate in their fullest extent,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      were formerly corrected by the labors of a numerous people, and</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      the active protection of a wise government. The hills were</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      clothed with rich beds of artificial mould, the rain was</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      collected in vast cisterns, a supply of fresh water was conveyed</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      by pipes and aqueducts to the dry lands. The breed of cattle was</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      encouraged in those parts which were not adapted for tillage, and</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      almost every spot was compelled to yield some production for the</a>

<a id='line_1399'>      But Gibbon has here eluded the question about the land “flowing</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      with milk and honey.” He is describing Judæa only, without</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      comprehending Galilee, or the rich pastures beyond the Jordan,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      even now proverbial for their flocks and herds. (See Burckhardt’s</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      Travels, and Hist of Jews, i. 178.) The following is believed to</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      be a fair statement: “The extraordinary fertility of the whole</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      country must be taken into the account. No part was waste; very</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      little was occupied by unprofitable wood; the more fertile hills</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      were cultivated in artificial terraces, others were hung with</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      orchards of fruit trees the more rocky and barren districts were</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      covered with vineyards.” Even in the present day, the wars and</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      misgovernment of ages have not exhausted the natural richness of</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      the soil. “Galilee,” says Malte Brun, “would be a paradise were</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      it inhabited by an industrious people under an enlightened</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      government. No land could be less dependent on foreign</a>

<a id='line_1415'>      necessary for the subsistence and comfort of a simple</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      agricultural people. The climate was healthy, the seasons</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      regular; the former rains, which fell about October, after the</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      vintage, prepared the ground for the seed; that latter, which</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      prevailed during March and the beginning of April, made it grow</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      rapidly. Directly the rains ceased, the grain ripened with still</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      greater rapidity, and was gathered in before the end of May. The</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      summer months were dry and very hot, but the nights cool and</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      refreshed by copious dews. In September, the vintage was</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      gathered. Grain of all kinds, wheat, barley, millet, zea, and</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      other sorts, grew in abundance; the wheat commonly yielded thirty</a>
