<a id='line_4'>          RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY,</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>        EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, AND BARON OF TITCHFIELD.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>THE love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end; whereof this</a>
<a id='line_9'>pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety.  The warrant</a>
<a id='line_10'>I have of your honourable disposition, not the worth of my untutored</a>
<a id='line_11'>lines, makes it assured of acceptance.  What I have done is yours; what</a>
<a id='line_12'>I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours.  Were</a>
<a id='line_13'>my worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is</a>
<a id='line_14'>bound to your Lordship, to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with</a>
<a id='line_15'>all happiness.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>                         Your Lordship's in all duty,</a>
<a id='line_18'>                              WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>                        THE ARGUMENT.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>LUCIUS TARQUINIUS (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he</a>
<a id='line_23'>had caused his own father-in-law, Servius Tullius, to be cruelly</a>
<a id='line_24'>murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or</a>
<a id='line_25'>staying for the people's suffrages, had possessed himself of the</a>
<a id='line_26'>kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to</a>
<a id='line_27'>besiege Ardea.  During which siege the principal men of the army</a>
<a id='line_28'>meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son,</a>
<a id='line_29'>in their discourses after supper, every one commended the virtues of</a>
<a id='line_30'>his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity</a>
<a id='line_31'>of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome;</a>
<a id='line_32'>and intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of</a>
<a id='line_33'>that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his</a>
<a id='line_34'>wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the</a>
<a id='line_35'>other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several</a>
<a id='line_36'>disports.  Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and</a>
<a id='line_37'>his wife the fame.  At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with</a>
<a id='line_38'>Lucrece's beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed</a>
<a id='line_39'>with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily</a>
<a id='line_40'>withdrew himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained</a>
<a id='line_41'>and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium.  The same night he treacherously</a>
<a id='line_42'>stealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the</a>
<a id='line_43'>morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily</a>
<a id='line_44'>dispatched messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp</a>
<a id='line_45'>for Collatine.  They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the</a>
<a id='line_46'>other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning</a>
<a id='line_47'>habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow.  She, first taking an oath of</a>
<a id='line_48'>them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his</a>
<a id='line_49'>dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself.  Which done, with one</a>
<a id='line_50'>consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the</a>
<a id='line_51'>Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the</a>
<a id='line_52'>people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter</a>
<a id='line_53'>invective against the tyranny of the king; wherewith the people were so</a>
<a id='line_54'>moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins</a>
<a id='line_55'>were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to</a>
<a id='line_56'>consuls.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>_______________________________________________________________</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>From the besieged Ardea all in post,</a>
<a id='line_61'>Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,</a>
<a id='line_62'>Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,</a>
<a id='line_63'>And to Collatium bears the lightless fire</a>
<a id='line_64'>Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire</a>
<a id='line_65'>  And girdle with embracing flames the waist</a>
<a id='line_66'>  Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>Haply that name of chaste unhapp'ly set</a>
<a id='line_69'>This bateless edge on his keen appetite;</a>
<a id='line_70'>When Collatine unwisely did not let</a>
<a id='line_71'>To praise the clear unmatched red and white</a>
<a id='line_72'>Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,</a>
<a id='line_73'>  Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,</a>
<a id='line_74'>  With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,</a>
<a id='line_77'>Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;</a>
<a id='line_78'>What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent</a>
<a id='line_79'>In the possession of his beauteous mate;</a>
<a id='line_80'>Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,</a>
<a id='line_81'>  That kings might be espoused to more fame,</a>
<a id='line_82'>  But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!</a>
<a id='line_85'>And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done</a>
<a id='line_86'>As is the morning's silver-melting dew</a>
<a id='line_87'>Against the golden splendour of the sun!</a>
<a id='line_88'>An expir'd date, cancell'd ere well begun:</a>
<a id='line_89'>  Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,</a>
<a id='line_90'>  Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>Beauty itself doth of itself persuade</a>
<a id='line_93'>The eyes of men without an orator;</a>
<a id='line_94'>What needeth then apologies be made,</a>
<a id='line_95'>To set forth that which is so singular?</a>
<a id='line_96'>Or why is Collatine the publisher</a>
<a id='line_97'>  Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown</a>
<a id='line_98'>  From thievish ears, because it is his own?</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty</a>
<a id='line_101'>Suggested this proud issue of a king;</a>
<a id='line_102'>For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:</a>
<a id='line_103'>Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,</a>
<a id='line_104'>Braving compare, disdainfully did sting</a>
<a id='line_105'>  His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt</a>
<a id='line_106'>  That golden hap which their superiors want.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>But some untimely thought did instigate</a>
<a id='line_109'>His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those;</a>
<a id='line_110'>His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,</a>
<a id='line_111'>Neglected all, with swift intent he goes</a>
<a id='line_112'>To quench the coal which in his liver glows.</a>
<a id='line_113'>  O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,</a>
<a id='line_114'>  Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>When at Collatium this false lord arriv'd,</a>
<a id='line_117'>Well was he welcom'd by the Roman dame,</a>
<a id='line_118'>Within whose face beauty and virtue striv'd</a>
<a id='line_119'>Which of them both should underprop her fame:</a>
<a id='line_120'>When virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame;</a>
<a id='line_121'>  When beauty boasted blushes, in despite</a>
<a id='line_122'>  Virtue would stain that or with silver white.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>But beauty, in that white intituled,</a>
<a id='line_125'>From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:</a>
<a id='line_126'>Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red,</a>
<a id='line_127'>Which virtue gave the golden age, to gild</a>
<a id='line_128'>Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;</a>
<a id='line_129'>  Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,—</a>
<a id='line_130'>  When shame assail'd, the red should fence the white.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen,</a>
<a id='line_133'>Argued by beauty's red, and virtue's white:</a>
<a id='line_134'>Of either's colour was the other queen,</a>
<a id='line_135'>Proving from world's minority their right:</a>
<a id='line_136'>Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;</a>
<a id='line_137'>  The sovereignty of either being so great,</a>
<a id='line_138'>  That oft they interchange each other's seat.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>Their silent war of lilies and of roses,</a>
<a id='line_141'>Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,</a>
<a id='line_142'>In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;</a>
<a id='line_143'>Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,</a>
<a id='line_144'>The coward captive vanquish'd doth yield</a>
<a id='line_145'>  To those two armies that would let him go,</a>
<a id='line_146'>  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,</a>
<a id='line_149'>(The niggard prodigal that prais'd her so)</a>
<a id='line_150'>In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,</a>
<a id='line_151'>Which far exceeds his barren skill to show:</a>
<a id='line_152'>Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe</a>
<a id='line_153'>  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,</a>
<a id='line_154'>  In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>This earthly saint, adored by this devil,</a>
<a id='line_157'>Little suspecteth the false worshipper;</a>
<a id='line_158'>For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;</a>
<a id='line_159'>Birds never lim'd no secret bushes fear:</a>
<a id='line_160'>So guiltless she securely gives good cheer</a>
<a id='line_161'>  And reverend welcome to her princely guest,</a>
<a id='line_162'>  Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>For that he colour'd with his high estate,</a>
<a id='line_165'>Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;</a>
<a id='line_166'>That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,</a>
<a id='line_167'>Save sometime too much wonder of his eye,</a>
<a id='line_168'>Which, having all, all could not satisfy;</a>
<a id='line_169'>  But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,</a>
<a id='line_170'>  That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>But she, that never cop'd with stranger eyes,</a>
<a id='line_173'>Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,</a>
<a id='line_174'>Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies</a>
<a id='line_175'>Writ in the glassy margents of such books;</a>
<a id='line_176'>She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;</a>
<a id='line_177'>  Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,</a>
<a id='line_178'>  More than his eyes were open'd to the light.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>He stories to her ears her husband's fame,</a>
<a id='line_181'>Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;</a>
<a id='line_182'>And decks with praises Collatine's high name,</a>
<a id='line_183'>Made glorious by his manly chivalry</a>
<a id='line_184'>With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:</a>
<a id='line_185'>  Her joy with heav'd-up hand she doth express,</a>
<a id='line_186'>  And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>Far from the purpose of his coming hither,</a>
<a id='line_189'>He makes excuses for his being there.</a>
<a id='line_190'>No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather</a>
<a id='line_191'>Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;</a>
<a id='line_192'>Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,</a>
<a id='line_193'>  Upon the world dim darkness doth display,</a>
<a id='line_194'>  And in her vaulty prison stows the day.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,</a>
<a id='line_197'>Intending weariness with heavy spright;</a>
<a id='line_198'>For, after supper, long he questioned</a>
<a id='line_199'>With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:</a>
<a id='line_200'>Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;</a>
<a id='line_201'>  And every one to rest themselves betake,</a>
<a id='line_202'>  Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving</a>
<a id='line_205'>The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;</a>
<a id='line_206'>Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,</a>
<a id='line_207'>Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:</a>
<a id='line_208'>Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;</a>
<a id='line_209'>  And when great treasure is the meed propos'd,</a>
<a id='line_210'>  Though death be adjunct, there's no death suppos'd.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>Those that much covet are with gain so fond,</a>
<a id='line_213'>For what they have not, that which they possess</a>
<a id='line_214'>They scatter and unloose it from their bond,</a>
<a id='line_215'>And so, by hoping more, they have but less;</a>
<a id='line_216'>Or, gaining more, the profit of excess</a>
<a id='line_217'>  Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,</a>
<a id='line_218'>  That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>The aim of all is but to nurse the life</a>
<a id='line_221'>With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;</a>
<a id='line_222'>And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,</a>
<a id='line_223'>That one for all, or all for one we gage;</a>
<a id='line_224'>As life for honour in fell battles' rage;</a>
<a id='line_225'>  Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost</a>
<a id='line_226'>  The death of all, and all together lost.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>So that in vent'ring ill we leave to be</a>
<a id='line_229'>The things we are, for that which we expect;</a>
<a id='line_230'>And this ambitious foul infirmity,</a>
<a id='line_231'>In having much, torments us with defect</a>
<a id='line_232'>Of that we have: so then we do neglect</a>
<a id='line_233'>  The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,</a>
<a id='line_234'>  Make something nothing, by augmenting it.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,</a>
<a id='line_237'>Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;</a>
<a id='line_238'>And for himself himself he must forsake:</a>
<a id='line_239'>Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?</a>
<a id='line_240'>When shall he think to find a stranger just,</a>
<a id='line_241'>  When he himself himself confounds, betrays</a>
<a id='line_242'>  To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>Now stole upon the time the dead of night,</a>
<a id='line_245'>When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:</a>
<a id='line_246'>No comfortable star did lend his light,</a>
<a id='line_247'>No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;</a>
<a id='line_248'>Now serves the season that they may surprise</a>
<a id='line_249'>  The silly lambs; pure thoughts are dead and still,</a>
<a id='line_250'>  While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,</a>
<a id='line_253'>Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;</a>
<a id='line_254'>Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;</a>
<a id='line_255'>Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;</a>
<a id='line_256'>But honest Fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,</a>
<a id='line_257'>  Doth too too oft betake him to retire,</a>
<a id='line_258'>  Beaten away by brain-sick rude Desire.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,</a>
<a id='line_261'>That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;</a>
<a id='line_262'>Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,</a>
<a id='line_263'>Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;</a>
<a id='line_264'>And to the flame thus speaks advisedly:</a>
<a id='line_265'>  'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,</a>
<a id='line_266'>  So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>Here pale with fear he doth premeditate</a>
<a id='line_269'>The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,</a>
<a id='line_270'>And in his inward mind he doth debate</a>
<a id='line_271'>What following sorrow may on this arise;</a>
<a id='line_272'>Then looking scornfully, he doth despise</a>
<a id='line_273'>  His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,</a>
<a id='line_274'>  And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not</a>
<a id='line_277'>To darken her whose light excelleth thine:</a>
<a id='line_278'>And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot</a>
<a id='line_279'>With your uncleanness that which is divine!</a>
<a id='line_280'>Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:</a>
<a id='line_281'>  Let fair humanity abhor the deed</a>
<a id='line_282'>  That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!</a>
<a id='line_285'>O foul dishonour to my household's grave!</a>
<a id='line_286'>O impious act, including all foul harms!</a>
<a id='line_287'>A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!</a>
<a id='line_288'>True valour still a true respect should have;</a>
<a id='line_289'>  Then my digression is so vile, so base,</a>
<a id='line_290'>  That it will live engraven in my face.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,</a>
<a id='line_293'>And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;</a>
<a id='line_294'>Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,</a>
<a id='line_295'>To cipher me how fondly I did dote;</a>
<a id='line_296'>That my posterity, sham'd with the note,</a>
<a id='line_297'>  Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin</a>
<a id='line_298'>  To wish that I their father had not been.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>'What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?</a>
<a id='line_301'>A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy:</a>
<a id='line_302'>Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?</a>
<a id='line_303'>Or sells eternity to get a toy?</a>
<a id='line_304'>For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?</a>
<a id='line_305'>  Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,</a>
<a id='line_306'>  Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>'If Collatinus dream of my intent,</a>
<a id='line_309'>Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage</a>
<a id='line_310'>Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?</a>
<a id='line_311'>This siege that hath engirt his marriage,</a>
<a id='line_312'>This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,</a>
<a id='line_313'>  This dying virtue, this surviving shame,</a>
<a id='line_314'>  Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>'O, what excuse can my invention make</a>
<a id='line_317'>When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?</a>
<a id='line_318'>Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake?</a>
<a id='line_319'>Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?</a>
<a id='line_320'>The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;</a>
<a id='line_321'>  And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,</a>
<a id='line_322'>  But, coward-like, with trembling terror die.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>'Had Collatinus kill'd my son or sire,</a>

<a id='line_414'>The wind wars with his torch, to make him stay,</a>
<a id='line_415'>And blows the smoke of it into his face,</a>
<a id='line_416'>Extinguishing his conduct in this case;</a>
<a id='line_417'>  But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,</a>
<a id='line_418'>  Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>And being lighted, by the light he spies</a>
<a id='line_421'>Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks;</a>

<a id='line_429'>He in the worst sense construes their denial:</a>
<a id='line_430'>The doors, the wind, the glove that did delay him,</a>
<a id='line_431'>He takes for accidental things of trial;</a>
<a id='line_432'>Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,</a>

<a id='line_471'>Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.</a>
<a id='line_472'>Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;</a>
<a id='line_473'>  But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,</a>
<a id='line_474'>  Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,</a>
<a id='line_477'>And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.</a>
<a id='line_478'>The curtains being close, about he walks,</a>
<a id='line_479'>Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:</a>
<a id='line_480'>By their high treason is his heart misled;</a>
<a id='line_481'>  Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon</a>
<a id='line_482'>  To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,</a>
<a id='line_485'>Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;</a>
<a id='line_486'>Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun</a>
<a id='line_487'>To wink, being blinded with a greater light:</a>
<a id='line_488'>Whether it is that she reflects so bright,</a>
<a id='line_489'>  That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;</a>

<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>O, had they in that darksome prison died,</a>
<a id='line_493'>Then had they seen the period of their ill!</a>
<a id='line_494'>Then Collatine again by Lucrece' side</a>
<a id='line_495'>In his clear bed might have reposed still:</a>
<a id='line_496'>But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;</a>
<a id='line_497'>  And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight</a>
<a id='line_498'>  Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.</a>

<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>Without the bed her other fair hand was,</a>

<a id='line_510'>Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,</a>
<a id='line_511'>With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night,</a>
<a id='line_512'>Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheath'd their light,</a>

<a id='line_537'>  Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,</a>
<a id='line_538'>  Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.</a>

<a id='line_549'>Obdurate vassals. fell exploits effecting,</a>
<a id='line_550'>In bloody death and ravishment delighting,</a>

<a id='line_552'>Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting:</a>
<a id='line_553'>  Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,</a>
<a id='line_554'>  Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,</a>
<a id='line_557'>His eye commends the leading to his hand;</a>
<a id='line_558'>His hand, as proud of such a dignity,</a>
<a id='line_559'>Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand</a>
<a id='line_560'>On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;</a>
<a id='line_561'>  Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,</a>
<a id='line_562'>  Left their round turrets destitute and pale.</a>

<a id='line_564'>They, mustering to the quiet cabinet</a>
<a id='line_565'>Where their dear governess and lady lies,</a>
<a id='line_566'>Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,</a>

<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,</a>

<a id='line_583'>Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:</a>
<a id='line_584'>Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries:</a>
<a id='line_585'>  Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,</a>

<a id='line_591'>Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,</a>
<a id='line_592'>Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.</a>
<a id='line_593'>  This moves in him more rage, and lesser pity,</a>

<a id='line_904'>He faintly flies, sweating with guilty fear;</a>
<a id='line_905'>  She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;</a>
<a id='line_906'>  He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loath'd delight.</a>

<a id='line_1487'>Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:</a>
<a id='line_1488'>Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:</a>
<a id='line_1489'>  Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,</a>
<a id='line_1490'>  Poor women's faces are their own faults' books.</a>
<a id='line_1491'></a>
<a id='line_1492'>No man inveigb against the wither'd flower,</a>

<a id='line_1494'>Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,</a>
<a id='line_1495'>Is worthy blame.  O, let it not be hild</a>
<a id='line_1496'>Poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  With men's abuses! those proud lords, to blame,</a>
<a id='line_1498'>  Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>Assail'd by night with circumstances strong</a>
<a id='line_1502'>Of present death, and shame that might ensue</a>
<a id='line_1503'>By that her death, to do her husband wrong:</a>
<a id='line_1504'>Such danger to resistance did belong;</a>
<a id='line_1505'>  The dying fear through all her body spread;</a>
<a id='line_1506'>  And who cannot abuse a body dead?</a>
<a id='line_1507'></a>
<a id='line_1508'>By this, mild Patience bid fair Lucrece speak</a>
<a id='line_1509'>To the poor counterfeit of her complaining:</a>
<a id='line_1510'>'My girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break</a>
<a id='line_1511'>Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are raining?</a>
<a id='line_1512'>If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,</a>
<a id='line_1513'>  Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:</a>
<a id='line_1514'>  If tears could help, mine own would do me good.</a>
<a id='line_1515'></a>
<a id='line_1516'>'But tell me, girl, when went'—(and there she stay'd</a>
<a id='line_1517'>Till after a deep groan) 'Tarquin from, hence?'</a>
<a id='line_1518'>'Madam, ere I was up,' replied the maid,</a>
<a id='line_1519'>'The more to blame my sluggard negligence:</a>
<a id='line_1520'>Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;</a>
<a id='line_1521'>  Myself was stirring ere the break of day,</a>
<a id='line_1522'>  And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>'But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,</a>
<a id='line_1525'>She would request to know your heaviness.'</a>
<a id='line_1526'>'O peace!' quoth Lucrece: 'if it should be told,</a>
<a id='line_1527'>The repetition cannot make it less;</a>
<a id='line_1528'>For more it is than I can well express:</a>
<a id='line_1529'>  And that deep torture may be call'd a hell,</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  When more is felt than one hath power to tell.</a>
<a id='line_1531'></a>
<a id='line_1532'>'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen—</a>
<a id='line_1533'>Yet save that labour, for I have them here.</a>
<a id='line_1534'>What should I say?—One of my husband's men</a>
<a id='line_1535'>Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear</a>
<a id='line_1536'>A letter to my lord, my love, my dear;</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;</a>
<a id='line_1538'>  The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.'</a>
<a id='line_1539'></a>
<a id='line_1540'>Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,</a>
<a id='line_1541'>First hovering o'er the paper with her quill:</a>
<a id='line_1542'>Conceit and grief an eager combat fight;</a>
<a id='line_1543'>What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;</a>
<a id='line_1544'>This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill:</a>
<a id='line_1545'>  Much like a press of people at a door,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>  Throng her inventions, which shall go before.</a>
<a id='line_1547'></a>
<a id='line_1548'>At last she thus begins:—'Thou worthy lord</a>
<a id='line_1549'>Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>Health to thy person! next vouchsafe to afford</a>
<a id='line_1551'>(If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see)</a>
<a id='line_1552'>Some present speed to come and visit me:</a>
<a id='line_1553'>  So, I commend me from our house in grief:</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'</a>
<a id='line_1555'></a>
<a id='line_1556'>Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,</a>
<a id='line_1557'>Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.</a>
<a id='line_1558'>By this short schedule Collatine may know</a>
<a id='line_1559'>Her grief, but not her grief's true quality;</a>
<a id='line_1560'>She dares not thereof make discovery,</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.</a>
<a id='line_1563'></a>
<a id='line_1564'>Besides, the life and feeling of her passion</a>
<a id='line_1565'>She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her;</a>
<a id='line_1566'>When sighs, and groans, and tears may grace the fashion</a>
<a id='line_1567'>Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her</a>
<a id='line_1568'>From that suspicion which the world my might bear her.</a>
<a id='line_1569'>  To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter</a>
<a id='line_1570'>  With words, till action might become them better.</a>
<a id='line_1571'></a>
<a id='line_1572'>To see sad sights moves more than hear them told;</a>
<a id='line_1573'>For then the eye interprets to the ear</a>
<a id='line_1574'>The heavy motion that it doth behold,</a>
<a id='line_1575'>When every part a part of woe doth bear.</a>
<a id='line_1576'>'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear:</a>
<a id='line_1577'>  Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ</a>
<a id='line_1581'>'At Ardea to my lord with more than haste;'</a>
<a id='line_1582'>The post attends, and she delivers it,</a>
<a id='line_1583'>Charging the sour-fac'd groom to hie as fast</a>
<a id='line_1584'>As lagging fowls before the northern blast.</a>
<a id='line_1585'>  Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:</a>
<a id='line_1586'>  Extremely still urgeth such extremes.</a>
<a id='line_1587'></a>
<a id='line_1588'>The homely villain court'sies to her low;</a>
<a id='line_1589'>And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye</a>
<a id='line_1590'>Receives the scroll, without or yea or no,</a>
<a id='line_1591'>And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.</a>
<a id='line_1592'>But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie</a>
<a id='line_1593'>  Imagine every eye beholds their blame;</a>
<a id='line_1594'>  For Lucrece thought he blush'd to see her shame:</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect</a>
<a id='line_1597'>Of spirit, life, and bold audacity.</a>
<a id='line_1598'>Such harmless creatures have a true respect</a>
<a id='line_1599'>To talk in deeds, while others saucily</a>
<a id='line_1600'>Promise more speed, but do it leisurely:</a>
<a id='line_1601'>  Even so this pattern of the worn-out age</a>
<a id='line_1602'>  Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.</a>
<a id='line_1603'></a>
<a id='line_1604'>His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>That two red fires in both their faces blaz'd;</a>
<a id='line_1606'>She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,</a>
<a id='line_1607'>And, blushing with him, wistly on him gaz'd;</a>
<a id='line_1608'>Her earnest eye did make him more amaz'd:</a>
<a id='line_1609'>  The more saw the blood his cheeks replenish,</a>
<a id='line_1610'>  The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.</a>
<a id='line_1611'></a>
<a id='line_1612'>But long she thinks till he return again,</a>
<a id='line_1613'>And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.</a>
<a id='line_1614'>The weary time she cannot entertain,</a>
<a id='line_1615'>For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, to groan:</a>
<a id='line_1616'>So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,</a>
<a id='line_1617'>  That she her plaints a little while doth stay,</a>
<a id='line_1618'>  Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.</a>
<a id='line_1619'></a>
<a id='line_1620'>At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece</a>
<a id='line_1621'>Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy;</a>
<a id='line_1622'>Before the which is drawn the power of Greece,</a>
<a id='line_1623'>For Helen's rape the city to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>Threat'ning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;</a>
<a id='line_1625'>  Which the conceited painter drew so proud,</a>
<a id='line_1626'>  As heaven (it seem'd) to kiss the turrets bow'd.</a>
<a id='line_1627'></a>
<a id='line_1628'>A thousand lamentable objects there,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>In scorn of Nature, Art gave lifeless life:</a>
<a id='line_1630'>Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,</a>
<a id='line_1631'>Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:</a>
<a id='line_1632'>The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;</a>
<a id='line_1633'>  The dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights,</a>
<a id='line_1634'>  Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.</a>
<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>There might you see the labouring pioner</a>
<a id='line_1637'>Begrim'd with sweat, and smeared all with dust;</a>
<a id='line_1638'>And from the towers of Troy there would appear</a>
<a id='line_1639'>The very eyes of men through loopholes thrust,</a>
<a id='line_1640'>Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:</a>
<a id='line_1641'>  Such sweet observance in this work was had,</a>
<a id='line_1642'>  That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>In great commanders grace and majesty</a>
<a id='line_1645'>You might behold, triumphing in their faces;</a>
<a id='line_1646'>In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;</a>
<a id='line_1647'>And here and there the painter interlaces</a>
<a id='line_1648'>Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces;</a>
<a id='line_1649'>  Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,</a>
<a id='line_1650'>  That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.</a>
<a id='line_1651'></a>
<a id='line_1652'>In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art</a>
<a id='line_1653'>Of physiognomy might one behold!</a>
<a id='line_1654'>The face of either 'cipher'd either's heart;</a>
<a id='line_1655'>Their face their manners most expressly told:</a>
<a id='line_1656'>In Ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigour roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_1657'>  But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent</a>
<a id='line_1658'>  Show'd deep regard and smiling government.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>As't were encouraging the Greeks to fight;</a>
<a id='line_1662'>Making such sober action with his hand</a>
<a id='line_1663'>That it beguiled attention, charm'd the sight:</a>
<a id='line_1664'>In speech, it seem'd, his beard, all silver white,</a>
<a id='line_1665'>  Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly</a>
<a id='line_1666'>  Thin winding breath, which purl'd up to the sky.</a>
<a id='line_1667'></a>
<a id='line_1668'>About him were a press of gaping faces,</a>
<a id='line_1669'>Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice;</a>
<a id='line_1670'>All jointly listening, but with several graces,</a>
<a id='line_1671'>As if some mermaid did their ears entice;</a>
<a id='line_1672'>Some high, some low, the painter was so nice:</a>
<a id='line_1673'>  The scalps of many, almost hid behind,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  To jump up higher seem'd to mock the mind.</a>
<a id='line_1675'></a>
<a id='line_1676'>Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,</a>
<a id='line_1677'>His nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear;</a>
<a id='line_1678'>Here one being throng'd bears back, all boll'n and red;</a>
<a id='line_1679'>Another smother'd seems to pelt and swear;</a>
<a id='line_1680'>And in their rage such signs of rage they bear,</a>
<a id='line_1681'>  As, but for loss of Nestor's golden words,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>  It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.</a>
<a id='line_1683'></a>
<a id='line_1684'>For much imaginary work was there;</a>
<a id='line_1685'>Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>That for Achilles' image stood his spear,</a>
<a id='line_1687'>Grip'd in an armed hand; himself, behind,</a>
<a id='line_1688'>Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:</a>
<a id='line_1689'>  A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,</a>
<a id='line_1690'>  Stood for the whole to be imagined,</a>
<a id='line_1691'></a>
<a id='line_1692'>And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy</a>
<a id='line_1693'>When their brave hope, bold Hector, march'd to field,</a>
<a id='line_1694'>Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy</a>
<a id='line_1695'>To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;</a>
<a id='line_1696'>And to their hope they such odd action yield,</a>
<a id='line_1697'>  That through their light joy seemed to appear,</a>
<a id='line_1698'>  (Like bright things stain'd) a kind of heavy fear,</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>And, from the strond of Dardan, where they fought,</a>
<a id='line_1701'>To Simois' reedy banks, the red blood ran,</a>
<a id='line_1702'>Whose waves to imitate the battle sought</a>
<a id='line_1703'>With swelling ridges; and their ranks began</a>
<a id='line_1704'>To break upon the galled shore, and than</a>
<a id='line_1705'>  Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>  They join, and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.</a>
<a id='line_1707'></a>
<a id='line_1708'>To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,</a>
<a id='line_1709'>To find a face where all distress is stell'd.</a>
<a id='line_1710'>Many she sees where cares have carved some,</a>
<a id='line_1711'>But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,</a>
<a id='line_1712'>Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,</a>
<a id='line_1713'>  Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>  Which bleeding under Pyrrhus' proud foot lies.</a>
<a id='line_1715'></a>
<a id='line_1716'>In her the painter had anatomiz'd</a>
<a id='line_1717'>Time's ruin, beauty's wrack, and grim care's reign:</a>
<a id='line_1718'>Her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguis'd;</a>
<a id='line_1719'>Of what she was no semblance did remain:</a>
<a id='line_1720'>Her blue blood, chang'd to black in every vein,</a>
<a id='line_1721'>  Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,</a>
<a id='line_1722'>  Show'd life imprison'd in a body dead.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1725'>And shapes her sorrow to the beldame's woes,</a>
<a id='line_1726'>Who nothing wants to answer her but cries,</a>
<a id='line_1727'>And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:</a>
<a id='line_1728'>The painter was no god to lend her those;</a>
<a id='line_1729'>  And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,</a>
<a id='line_1730'>  To give her so much grief, and not a tongue.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>'Poor instrument,' quoth she, 'without a sound,</a>
<a id='line_1733'>I'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue;</a>
<a id='line_1734'>And drop sweet balm in Priam's painted wound,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong,</a>
<a id='line_1736'>And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long;</a>
<a id='line_1737'>  And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes</a>
<a id='line_1738'>  Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1739'></a>
<a id='line_1740'>'Show me the strumpet that began this stir,</a>
<a id='line_1741'>That with my nails her beauty I may tear.</a>
<a id='line_1742'>Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur</a>
<a id='line_1743'>This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear;</a>
<a id='line_1744'>Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here:</a>
<a id='line_1745'>  And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.</a>
<a id='line_1747'></a>
<a id='line_1748'>'Why should the private pleasure of some one</a>
<a id='line_1749'>Become the public plague of many mo?</a>
<a id='line_1750'>Let sin, alone committed, light alone</a>
<a id='line_1751'>Upon his head that hath transgressed so.</a>
<a id='line_1752'>Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:</a>
<a id='line_1753'>  For one's offence why should so many fall,</a>
<a id='line_1754'>  To plague a private sin in general?</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>'Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,</a>
<a id='line_1757'>Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds;</a>
<a id='line_1758'>Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,</a>
<a id='line_1759'>And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>And one man's lust these many lives confounds:</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  Had doting Priam check'd his son's desire,</a>
<a id='line_1762'>  Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:</a>
<a id='line_1765'>For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,</a>
<a id='line_1766'>Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;</a>
<a id='line_1767'>Then little strength rings out the doleful knell:</a>
<a id='line_1768'>So Lucrece set a-work sad tales doth tell</a>
<a id='line_1769'>  To pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow;</a>
<a id='line_1770'>  She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>She throws her eyes about the painting round,</a>
<a id='line_1773'>And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament:</a>
<a id='line_1774'>At last she sees a wretched image bound,</a>
<a id='line_1775'>That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:</a>
<a id='line_1776'>His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;</a>
<a id='line_1777'>  Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,</a>
<a id='line_1778'>  So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>In him the painter labour'd with his skill</a>
<a id='line_1781'>To hide deceit, and give the harmless show</a>
<a id='line_1782'>An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,</a>
<a id='line_1783'>A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe;</a>
<a id='line_1784'>Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so</a>
<a id='line_1785'>  That blushing red no guilty instance gave,</a>
<a id='line_1786'>  Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>But, like a constant and confirmed devil,</a>
<a id='line_1789'>He entertain'd a show so seeming just,</a>
<a id='line_1790'>And therein so ensconc'd his secret evil,</a>
<a id='line_1791'>That jealousy itself cold not mistrust</a>
<a id='line_1792'>False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust</a>
<a id='line_1793'>  Into so bright a day such black-fac'd storms,</a>
<a id='line_1794'>  Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.</a>
<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>The well-skill'd workman this mild image drew</a>
<a id='line_1797'>For perjur'd Sinon, whose enchanting story</a>
<a id='line_1798'>The credulous Old Priam after slew;</a>
<a id='line_1799'>Whose words, like wildfire, burnt the shining glory</a>
<a id='line_1800'>Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,</a>
<a id='line_1801'>  And little stars shot from their fixed places,</a>
<a id='line_1802'>  When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>This picture she advisedly perus'd,</a>
<a id='line_1805'>And chid the painter for his wondrous skill;</a>
<a id='line_1806'>Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abus'd;</a>
<a id='line_1807'>So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill:</a>
<a id='line_1808'>And still on him she gaz'd; and gazing still,</a>
<a id='line_1809'>  Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,</a>
<a id='line_1810'>  That she concludes the picture was belied.</a>
<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>'It cannot be,' quoth she, 'that so much guile'—</a>
<a id='line_1813'>(She would have said) 'can lurk in such a look;'</a>
<a id='line_1814'>But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took;</a>
<a id='line_1816'>'It cannot be' she in that sense forsook,</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  And turn'd it thus: 'It cannot be, I find,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>  But such a face should bear a wicked mind:</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>'For even as subtle Sinon here is painted,</a>
<a id='line_1821'>So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,</a>
<a id='line_1822'>(As if with grief or travail he had fainted,)</a>
<a id='line_1823'>To me came Tarquin armed; so beguil'd</a>
<a id='line_1824'>With outward honesty, but yet defil'd</a>
<a id='line_1825'>  With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish,</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.</a>
<a id='line_1827'></a>
<a id='line_1828'>'Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds.</a>
<a id='line_1830'>Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?</a>
<a id='line_1831'>For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds;</a>
<a id='line_1832'>His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;</a>
<a id='line_1833'>  Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>  Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>'Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;</a>
<a id='line_1837'>For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,</a>
<a id='line_1838'>And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell;</a>
<a id='line_1839'>These contraries such unity do hold,</a>
<a id='line_1840'>Only to flatter fools, and make them bold;</a>
<a id='line_1841'>  So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,</a>
<a id='line_1842'>  That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.'</a>
<a id='line_1843'></a>
<a id='line_1844'>Here, all enrag'd, such passion her assails,</a>
<a id='line_1845'>That patience is quite beaten from her breast.</a>
<a id='line_1846'>She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,</a>
<a id='line_1847'>Comparing him to that unhappy guest</a>
<a id='line_1848'>Whose deed hath made herself herself detest;</a>
<a id='line_1849'>  At last she smilingly with this gives o'er;</a>
<a id='line_1850'>  'Fool, fool!' quoth she, 'his wounds will not be sore.'</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_1853'>And time doth weary time with her complaining.</a>
<a id='line_1854'>She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,</a>
<a id='line_1855'>And both she thinks too long with her remaining:</a>
<a id='line_1856'>Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining.</a>
<a id='line_1857'>  Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps;</a>
<a id='line_1858'>  And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>Which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>That she with painted images hath spent;</a>
<a id='line_1862'>Being from the feeling of her own grief brought</a>
<a id='line_1863'>By deep surmise of others' detriment:</a>
<a id='line_1864'>Losing her woes in shows of discontent.</a>
<a id='line_1865'>  It easeth some, though none it ever cur'd,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>  To think their dolour others have endur'd.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>But now the mindful messenger, come back,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>Brings home his lord and other company;</a>
<a id='line_1870'>Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:</a>
<a id='line_1871'>And round about her tear-distained eye</a>
<a id='line_1872'>Blue circles stream'd, like rainbows in the sky.</a>
<a id='line_1873'>  These water-galls in her dim element</a>
<a id='line_1874'>  Foretell new storms to those already spent.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,</a>
<a id='line_1877'>Amazedly in her sad face he stares:</a>
<a id='line_1878'>Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.</a>
<a id='line_1880'>He hath no power to ask her how she fares,</a>
<a id='line_1881'>  Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>  Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.</a>
<a id='line_1883'></a>
<a id='line_1884'>At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,</a>
<a id='line_1885'>And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event</a>
<a id='line_1886'>Hath thee befall'n, that thou dost trembling stand?</a>
<a id='line_1887'>Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?</a>
<a id='line_1888'>Why art thou thus attir'd in discontent?</a>
<a id='line_1889'>  Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>  And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.'</a>
<a id='line_1891'></a>
<a id='line_1892'>Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,</a>
<a id='line_1893'>Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:</a>
<a id='line_1894'>At length address'd to answer his desire,</a>
<a id='line_1895'>She modestly prepares to let them know</a>
<a id='line_1896'>Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  While Collatine and his consorted lords</a>
<a id='line_1898'>  With sad attention long to hear her words.</a>
<a id='line_1899'></a>
<a id='line_1900'>And now this pale swan in her watery nest</a>
<a id='line_1901'>Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending:</a>
<a id='line_1902'>'Few words,' quoth she, 'shall fit the trespass best,</a>
<a id='line_1903'>Where no excuse can give the fault amending:</a>
<a id='line_1904'>In me more woes than words are now depending;</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  And my laments would be drawn out too long,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.</a>
<a id='line_1907'></a>
<a id='line_1908'>'Then be this all the task it hath to say:—</a>
<a id='line_1909'>Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed</a>
<a id='line_1910'>A stranger came, and on that pillow lay</a>
<a id='line_1911'>Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head;</a>

<a id='line_1916'>'For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,</a>

<a id='line_2013'>Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;</a>
<a id='line_2014'>While with a joyless smile she turns away</a>
<a id='line_2015'>The face, that map which deep impression bears</a>
<a id='line_2016'>Of hard misfortune, carv'd in it with tears.</a>
<a id='line_2017'>  'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living,</a>
<a id='line_2018'>  By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.</a>
<a id='line_2019'></a>
<a id='line_2020'>Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,</a>
<a id='line_2021'>She throws forth Tarquin's name: 'He, he,' she says,</a>
<a id='line_2022'>But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;</a>
<a id='line_2023'>Till after many accents and delays,</a>
<a id='line_2024'>Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>  She utters this: 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'</a>
<a id='line_2027'></a>
<a id='line_2028'>Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast</a>
<a id='line_2029'>A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheath'd:</a>
<a id='line_2030'>That blow did bail it from the deep unrest</a>
<a id='line_2031'>Of that polluted prison where it breath'd:</a>
<a id='line_2032'>Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd</a>
<a id='line_2033'>  Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly</a>
<a id='line_2034'>  Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny.</a>
<a id='line_2035'></a>
<a id='line_2036'>Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;</a>
<a id='line_2038'>Till Lucrece' father that beholds her bleed,</a>
<a id='line_2039'>Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;</a>
<a id='line_2040'>And from the purple fountain Brutus drew</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;</a>
<a id='line_2043'></a>
<a id='line_2044'>And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide</a>
<a id='line_2045'>In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood</a>
<a id='line_2046'>Circles her body in on every side,</a>
<a id='line_2047'>Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood</a>
<a id='line_2048'>Bare and unpeopled, in this fearful flood.</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>  And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.</a>
<a id='line_2051'></a>
<a id='line_2052'>About the mourning and congealed face</a>
<a id='line_2053'>Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,</a>
<a id='line_2054'>Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:</a>
<a id='line_2055'>And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,</a>
<a id='line_2056'>Corrupted blood some watery token shows;</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  And blood untainted still doth red abide,</a>
<a id='line_2058'>  Blushing at that which is so putrified.</a>
<a id='line_2059'></a>
<a id='line_2060'>'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>'That life was mine which thou hast here depriv'd.</a>
<a id='line_2062'>If in the child the father's image lies,</a>
<a id='line_2063'>Where shall I live now Lucrece is unliv'd?</a>
<a id='line_2064'>Thou wast not to this end from me deriv'd</a>
<a id='line_2065'>  If children pre-decease progenitors,</a>
<a id='line_2066'>  We are their offspring, and they none of ours.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>'Poor broken glass, I often did behold</a>
<a id='line_2069'>In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;</a>
<a id='line_2070'>But now that fair fresh mirror, dim and old,</a>
<a id='line_2071'>Shows me a bare-bon'd death by time outworn;</a>
<a id='line_2072'>O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn!</a>
<a id='line_2073'>  And shiver'd all the beauty of my glass,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>  That I no more can see what once I was!</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>'O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,</a>
<a id='line_2077'>If they surcease to be that should survive.</a>
<a id='line_2078'>Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger,</a>
<a id='line_2079'>And leave the faltering feeble souls alive?</a>
<a id='line_2080'>The old bees die, the young possess their hive:</a>
<a id='line_2081'>  Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again, and see</a>
<a id='line_2082'>  Thy father die, and not thy father thee!'</a>
<a id='line_2083'></a>
<a id='line_2084'>By this starts Collatine as from a dream,</a>
<a id='line_2085'>And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;</a>
<a id='line_2086'>And then in key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream</a>
<a id='line_2087'>He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>And counterfeits to die with her a space;</a>
<a id='line_2089'>  Till manly shame bids him possess his breath,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>  And live, to be revenged on her death.</a>
<a id='line_2091'></a>
<a id='line_2092'>The deep vexation of his inward soul</a>
<a id='line_2093'>Hath serv'd a dumb arrest upon his tongue;</a>
<a id='line_2094'>Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,</a>
<a id='line_2095'>Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng</a>
<a id='line_2097'>  Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart's aid,</a>
<a id='line_2098'>  That no man could distinguish what he said.</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>Yet sometime 'Tarquin' was pronounced plain,</a>
<a id='line_2101'>But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.</a>
<a id='line_2102'>This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,</a>
<a id='line_2103'>Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more;</a>
<a id='line_2104'>At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:</a>
<a id='line_2105'>  Then son and father weep with equal strife,</a>
<a id='line_2106'>  Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.</a>
<a id='line_2107'></a>
<a id='line_2108'>The one doth call her his, the other his,</a>
<a id='line_2109'>Yet neither may possess the claim they lay,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>The father says 'She's mine,' 'O, mine she is,'</a>
<a id='line_2111'>Replies her husband: 'do not take away</a>
<a id='line_2112'>My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say</a>
<a id='line_2113'>  He weeps for her, for she was only mine,</a>
<a id='line_2114'>  And only must be wail'd by Collatine.'</a>
<a id='line_2115'></a>
<a id='line_2116'>'O,' quoth Lucretius, 'I did give that life</a>
<a id='line_2117'>Which she too early and too late hath spill'd.'</a>
<a id='line_2118'>'Woe, woe,' quoth Collatine, 'she was my wife,</a>
<a id='line_2119'>I owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath kill'd.'</a>
<a id='line_2120'>'My daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours fill'd</a>
<a id='line_2121'>  The dispers'd air, who, holding Lucrece' life,</a>
<a id='line_2122'>  Answer'd their cries, 'My daughter!' and 'My wife!'</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,</a>
<a id='line_2125'>Seeing such emulation in their woe,</a>
<a id='line_2126'>Began to clothe his wit in state and pride,</a>
<a id='line_2127'>Burying in Lucrece' wound his folly's show.</a>
<a id='line_2128'>He with the Romans was esteemed so</a>
<a id='line_2129'>  As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,</a>
<a id='line_2130'>  For sportive words, and uttering foolish things:</a>
<a id='line_2131'></a>
<a id='line_2132'>But now he throws that shallow habit by,</a>
<a id='line_2133'>Wherein deep policy did him disguise;</a>
<a id='line_2134'>And arm'd his long-hid wits advisedly,</a>
<a id='line_2135'>To check the tears in Collatinus' eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2136'>'Thou wronged lord of Rome,' quoth he, 'arise;</a>
<a id='line_2137'>  Let my unsounded self, suppos'd a fool,</a>
<a id='line_2138'>  Now set thy long-experienc'd wit to school.</a>
<a id='line_2139'></a>
<a id='line_2140'>'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?</a>
<a id='line_2141'>Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?</a>
<a id='line_2142'>Is it revenge to give thyself a blow,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?</a>
<a id='line_2144'>Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:</a>
<a id='line_2145'>  Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,</a>
<a id='line_2146'>  To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.</a>
<a id='line_2147'></a>
<a id='line_2148'>'Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart</a>
<a id='line_2149'>In such relenting dew of lamentations,</a>
<a id='line_2150'>But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part,</a>
<a id='line_2151'>To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,</a>
<a id='line_2152'>That they will suffer these abominations,</a>
<a id='line_2153'> (Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgrac'd,)</a>
<a id='line_2154'>  By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chas'd.</a>
<a id='line_2155'></a>
<a id='line_2156'>'Now, by the Capitol that we adore,</a>
<a id='line_2157'>And by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd,</a>
<a id='line_2158'>By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's store,</a>
<a id='line_2159'>By all our country rights in Rome maintain'd,</a>
<a id='line_2160'>And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complain'd</a>
<a id='line_2161'>  Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,</a>
<a id='line_2162'>  We will revenge the death of this true wife.'</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,</a>
<a id='line_2165'>And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;</a>
<a id='line_2166'>And to his protestation urg'd the rest,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>Who, wondering at him, did his words allow;</a>
<a id='line_2168'>Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow;</a>
<a id='line_2169'>  And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,</a>
<a id='line_2170'>  He doth again repeat, and that they swore.</a>
<a id='line_2171'></a>
<a id='line_2172'>When they had sworn to this advised doom,</a>
<a id='line_2173'>They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;</a>
<a id='line_2174'>To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,</a>
<a id='line_2175'>And so to publish Tarquin's foul offence:</a>
<a id='line_2176'>Which being done with speedy diligence,</a>
<a id='line_2177'>  The Romans plausibly did give consent</a>
<a id='line_2178'>  To Tarquin's everlasting banishment.</a>
