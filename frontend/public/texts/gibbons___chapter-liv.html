<a id='line_5'>     Consequences Of The Reformation.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      In the profession of Christianity, the variety of national</a>
<a id='line_8'>      characters may be clearly distinguished. The natives of Syria and</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Egypt abandoned their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion:</a>
<a id='line_10'>      Rome again aspired to the dominion of the world; and the wit of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      the lively and loquacious Greeks was consumed in the disputes of</a>
<a id='line_12'>      metaphysical theology. The incomprehensible mysteries of the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Trinity and Incarnation, instead of commanding their silent</a>
<a id='line_14'>      submission, were agitated in vehement and subtile controversies,</a>
<a id='line_15'>      which enlarged their faith at the expense, perhaps, of their</a>
<a id='line_16'>      charity and reason. From the council of Nice to the end of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was invaded by</a>
<a id='line_18'>      these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the decline</a>
<a id='line_19'>      and fall of the empire, that the historian has too often been</a>
<a id='line_20'>      compelled to attend the synods, to explore the creeds, and to</a>
<a id='line_21'>      enumerate the sects, of this busy period of ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_22'>      annals. From the beginning of the eighth century to the last ages</a>
<a id='line_23'>      of the Byzantine empire, the sound of controversy was seldom</a>
<a id='line_24'>      heard: curiosity was exhausted, zeal was fatigued, and, in the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      decrees of six councils, the articles of the Catholic faith had</a>
<a id='line_26'>      been irrevocably defined. The spirit of dispute, however vain and</a>
<a id='line_27'>      pernicious, requires some energy and exercise of the mental</a>
<a id='line_28'>      faculties; and the prostrate Greeks were content to fast, to</a>
<a id='line_29'>      pray, and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his</a>
<a id='line_30'>      clergy. During a long dream of superstition, the Virgin and the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Saints, their visions and miracles, their relics and images, were</a>
<a id='line_32'>      preached by the monks, and worshipped by the people; and the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      appellation of people might be extended, without injustice, to</a>
<a id='line_34'>      the first ranks of civil society. At an unseasonable moment, the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their</a>
<a id='line_36'>      subjects: under their influence reason might obtain some</a>
<a id='line_37'>      proselytes, a far greater number was swayed by interest or fear;</a>
<a id='line_38'>      but the Eastern world embraced or deplored their visible deities,</a>
<a id='line_39'>      and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of</a>
<a id='line_40'>      orthodoxy. In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_41'>      rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the pleasure,</a>
<a id='line_42'>      of persecution. The Pagans had disappeared; the Jews were silent</a>
<a id='line_43'>      and obscure; the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote</a>
<a id='line_44'>      hostilities against a national enemy; and the sects of Egypt and</a>
<a id='line_45'>      Syria enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian</a>
<a id='line_46'>      caliphs. About the middle of the seventh century, a branch of</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Manichaeans was selected as the victims of spiritual tyranny;</a>
<a id='line_48'>      their patience was at length exasperated to despair and</a>
<a id='line_49'>      rebellion; and their exile has scattered over the West the seeds</a>
<a id='line_50'>      of reformation. These important events will justify some inquiry</a>
<a id='line_51'>      into the doctrine and story of the Paulicians; 1 and, as they</a>
<a id='line_52'>      cannot plead for themselves, our candid criticism will magnify</a>
<a id='line_53'>      the good, and abate or suspect the evil, that is reported by</a>
<a id='line_54'>      their adversaries.</a>

<a id='line_57'>      weighed, with his usual judgment and candor, by the learned</a>
<a id='line_58'>      Mosheim, (Hist. Ecclesiast. seculum ix. p. 311, &c.) He draws his</a>
<a id='line_59'>      original intelligence from Photius (contra Manichaeos, l. i.) and</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Peter Siculus, (Hist. Manichaeorum.) The first of these accounts</a>
<a id='line_61'>      has not fallen into my hands; the second, which Mosheim prefers,</a>
<a id='line_62'>      I have read in a Latin version inserted in the Maxima Bibliotheca</a>
<a id='line_63'>      Patrum, (tom. xvi. p. 754-764,) from the edition of the Jesuit</a>
<a id='line_64'>      Raderus, (Ingolstadii, 1604, in 4to.) * Note: Compare Hallam’s</a>
<a id='line_65'>      Middle Ages, p. 461-471. Mr. Hallam justly observes that this</a>
<a id='line_66'>      chapter “appears to be accurate as well as luminous, and is at</a>
<a id='line_67'>      least far superior to any modern work on the subject.”—M.]</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>      The Gnostics, who had distracted the infancy, were oppressed by</a>
<a id='line_70'>      the greatness and authority, of the church. Instead of emulating</a>
<a id='line_71'>      or surpassing the wealth, learning, and numbers of the Catholics,</a>
<a id='line_72'>      their obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East</a>
<a id='line_73'>      and West, and confined to the villages and mountains along the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      borders of the Euphrates. Some vestige of the Marcionites may be</a>
<a id='line_75'>      detected in the fifth century; 2 but the numerous sects were</a>
<a id='line_76'>      finally lost in the odious name of the Manichaeans; and these</a>
<a id='line_77'>      heretics, who presumed to reconcile the doctrines of Zoroaster</a>
<a id='line_78'>      and Christ, were pursued by the two religions with equal and</a>
<a id='line_79'>      unrelenting hatred. Under the grandson of Heraclius, in the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      neighborhood of Samosata, more famous for the birth of Lucian</a>
<a id='line_81'>      than for the title of a Syrian kingdom, a reformer arose,</a>
<a id='line_82'>      esteemed by the Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth. In</a>
<a id='line_83'>      his humble dwelling of Mananalis, Constantine entertained a</a>
<a id='line_84'>      deacon, who returned from Syrian captivity, and received the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      inestimable gift of the New Testament, which was already</a>
<a id='line_86'>      concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek, and</a>
<a id='line_87'>      perhaps of the Gnostic, clergy. 3 These books became the measure</a>
<a id='line_88'>      of his studies and the rule of his faith; and the Catholics, who</a>
<a id='line_89'>      dispute his interpretation, acknowledge that his text was genuine</a>
<a id='line_90'>      and sincere. But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to</a>
<a id='line_91'>      the writings and character of St. Paul: the name of the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      Paulicians is derived by their enemies from some unknown and</a>
<a id='line_93'>      domestic teacher; but I am confident that they gloried in their</a>
<a id='line_94'>      affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles. His disciples, Titus,</a>
<a id='line_95'>      Timothy, Sylvanus, Tychicus, were represented by Constantine and</a>
<a id='line_96'>      his fellow-laborers: the names of the apostolic churches were</a>
<a id='line_97'>      applied to the congregations which they assembled in Armenia and</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Cappadocia; and this innocent allegory revived the example and</a>
<a id='line_99'>      memory of the first ages. In the Gospel, and the Epistles of St.</a>
<a id='line_100'>      Paul, his faithful follower investigated the Creed of primitive</a>
<a id='line_101'>      Christianity; and, whatever might be the success, a Protestant</a>
<a id='line_102'>      reader will applaud the spirit, of the inquiry. But if the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      Scriptures of the Paulicians were pure, they were not perfect.</a>
<a id='line_104'>      Their founders rejected the two Epistles of St. Peter, 4 the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      apostle of the circumcision, whose dispute with their favorite</a>
<a id='line_106'>      for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven. 5</a>
<a id='line_107'>      They agreed with their Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt</a>
<a id='line_108'>      for the Old Testament, the books of Moses and the prophets, which</a>
<a id='line_109'>      have been consecrated by the decrees of the Catholic church. With</a>
<a id='line_110'>      equal boldness, and doubtless with more reason, Constantine, the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      new Sylvanus, disclaimed the visions, which, in so many bulky and</a>
<a id='line_112'>      splendid volumes, had been published by the Oriental sects; 6 the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      fabulous productions of the Hebrew patriarchs and the sages of</a>
<a id='line_114'>      the East; the spurious gospels, epistles, and acts, which in the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      first age had overwhelmed the orthodox code; the theology of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      Manes, and the authors of the kindred heresies; and the thirty</a>
<a id='line_117'>      generations, or aeons, which had been created by the fruitful</a>
<a id='line_118'>      fancy of Valentine. The Paulicians sincerely condemned the memory</a>
<a id='line_119'>      and opinions of the Manichaean sect, and complained of the</a>
<a id='line_120'>      injustice which impressed that invidious name on the simple</a>
<a id='line_121'>      votaries of St. Paul and of Christ.</a>

<a id='line_138'>      the Apocalypse, (Petr. Sicul. p. 756;) but as such neglect is not</a>
<a id='line_139'>      imputed as a crime, the Greeks of the ixth century must have been</a>

<a id='line_154'>      pity, Incendite omnes illas membranas: and his advice had been</a>
<a id='line_155'>      rigorously followed.]</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>      Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links had been broken by the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      Paulician reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they</a>
<a id='line_159'>      reduced the number of masters, at whose voice profane reason must</a>
<a id='line_160'>      bow to mystery and miracle. The early separation of the Gnostics</a>
<a id='line_161'>      had preceded the establishment of the Catholic worship; and</a>
<a id='line_162'>      against the gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they</a>
<a id='line_163'>      were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion, as by the silence</a>
<a id='line_164'>      of St. Paul and the evangelists. The objects which had been</a>
<a id='line_165'>      transformed by the magic of superstition, appeared to the eyes of</a>
<a id='line_166'>      the Paulicians in their genuine and naked colors. An image made</a>
<a id='line_167'>      without hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist, to</a>
<a id='line_168'>      whose skill alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their</a>
<a id='line_169'>      merit or value. The miraculous relics were a heap of bones and</a>
<a id='line_170'>      ashes, destitute of life or virtue, or of any relation, perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_171'>      with the person to whom they were ascribed. The true and</a>
<a id='line_172'>      vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber, the body</a>
<a id='line_173'>      and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine, the gifts</a>
<a id='line_174'>      of nature and the symbols of grace. The mother of God was</a>
<a id='line_175'>      degraded from her celestial honors and immaculate virginity; and</a>
<a id='line_176'>      the saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the</a>
<a id='line_177'>      laborious office of mediation in heaven, and ministry upon earth.</a>
<a id='line_178'>      In the practice, or at least in the theory, of the sacraments,</a>
<a id='line_179'>      the Paulicians were inclined to abolish all visible objects of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      worship, and the words of the gospel were, in their judgment, the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      baptism and communion of the faithful. They indulged a convenient</a>
<a id='line_182'>      latitude for the interpretation of Scripture: and as often as</a>
<a id='line_183'>      they were pressed by the literal sense, they could escape to the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      intricate mazes of figure and allegory. Their utmost diligence</a>
<a id='line_185'>      must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the</a>
<a id='line_186'>      Old and the New Testament; since they adored the latter as the</a>
<a id='line_187'>      oracles of God, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and</a>
<a id='line_188'>      absurd invention of men or daemons. We cannot be surprised, that</a>
<a id='line_189'>      they should have found in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the</a>
<a id='line_190'>      Trinity: but, instead of confessing the human nature and</a>
<a id='line_191'>      substantial sufferings of Christ, they amused their fancy with a</a>
<a id='line_192'>      celestial body that passed through the virgin like water through</a>
<a id='line_193'>      a pipe; with a fantastic crucifixion, that eluded the vain and</a>
<a id='line_194'>      important malice of the Jews. A creed thus simple and spiritual</a>
<a id='line_195'>      was not adapted to the genius of the times; 7 and the rational</a>
<a id='line_196'>      Christian, who might have been contented with the light yoke and</a>
<a id='line_197'>      easy burden of Jesus and his apostles, was justly offended, that</a>
<a id='line_198'>      the Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God, the first</a>
<a id='line_199'>      article of natural and revealed religion. Their belief and their</a>
<a id='line_200'>      trust was in the Father, of Christ, of the human soul, and of the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      invisible world.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>      But they likewise held the eternity of matter; a stubborn and</a>
<a id='line_204'>      rebellious substance, the origin of a second principle of an</a>
<a id='line_205'>      active being, who has created this visible world, and exercises</a>
<a id='line_206'>      his temporal reign till the final consummation of death and sin.</a>
<a id='line_207'>      8 The appearances of moral and physical evil had established the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      two principles in the ancient philosophy and religion of the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      East; from whence this doctrine was transfused to the various</a>
<a id='line_210'>      swarms of the Gnostics. A thousand shades may be devised in the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      nature and character of Ahriman, from a rival god to a</a>
<a id='line_212'>      subordinate daemon, from passion and frailty to pure and perfect</a>
<a id='line_213'>      malevolence: but, in spite of our efforts, the goodness, and the</a>
<a id='line_214'>      power, of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      line; and every step that approaches the one must recede in equal</a>

<a id='line_231'>      The apostolic labors of Constantine Sylvanus soon multiplied the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      number of his disciples, the secret recompense of spiritual</a>
<a id='line_233'>      ambition. The remnant of the Gnostic sects, and especially the</a>
<a id='line_234'>      Manichaeans of Armenia, were united under his standard; many</a>
<a id='line_235'>      Catholics were converted or seduced by his arguments; and he</a>
<a id='line_236'>      preached with success in the regions of Pontus 10 and Cappadocia,</a>
<a id='line_237'>      which had long since imbibed the religion of Zoroaster. The</a>
<a id='line_238'>      Paulician teachers were distinguished only by their Scriptural</a>
<a id='line_239'>      names, by the modest title of Fellow-pilgrims, by the austerity</a>
<a id='line_240'>      of their lives, their zeal or knowledge, and the credit of some</a>
<a id='line_241'>      extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit. But they were incapable</a>
<a id='line_242'>      of desiring, or at least of obtaining, the wealth and honors of</a>
<a id='line_243'>      the Catholic prelacy; such anti-Christian pride they bitterly</a>
<a id='line_244'>      censured; and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned</a>
<a id='line_245'>      as an institution of the Jewish synagogue. The new sect was</a>
<a id='line_246'>      loosely spread over the provinces of Asia Minor to the westward</a>
<a id='line_247'>      of the Euphrates; six of their principal congregations</a>

<a id='line_249'>      epistles; and their founder chose his residence in the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      neighborhood of Colonia, 11 in the same district of Pontus which</a>
<a id='line_251'>      had been celebrated by the altars of Bellona 12 and the miracles</a>
<a id='line_252'>      of Gregory. 13 After a mission of twenty-seven years, Sylvanus,</a>
<a id='line_253'>      who had retired from the tolerating government of the Arabs, fell</a>
<a id='line_254'>      a sacrifice to Roman persecution. The laws of the pious emperors,</a>
<a id='line_255'>      which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics,</a>
<a id='line_256'>      proscribed without mercy or disguise the tenets, the books, and</a>
<a id='line_257'>      the persons of the Montanists and Manichaeans: the books were</a>
<a id='line_258'>      delivered to the flames; and all who should presume to secrete</a>
<a id='line_259'>      such writings, or to profess such opinions, were devoted to an</a>
<a id='line_260'>      ignominious death. 14 A Greek minister, armed with legal and</a>
<a id='line_261'>      military powers, appeared at Colonia to strike the shepherd, and</a>
<a id='line_262'>      to reclaim, if possible, the lost sheep. By a refinement of</a>
<a id='line_263'>      cruelty, Simeon placed the unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of</a>
<a id='line_264'>      his disciples, who were commanded, as the price of their pardon</a>
<a id='line_265'>      and the proof of their repentance, to massacre their spiritual</a>
<a id='line_266'>      father. They turned aside from the impious office; the stones</a>
<a id='line_267'>      dropped from their filial hands, and of the whole number, only</a>
<a id='line_268'>      one executioner could be found, a new David, as he is styled by</a>
<a id='line_269'>      the Catholics, who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy. This</a>
<a id='line_270'>      apostate (Justin was his name) again deceived and betrayed his</a>
<a id='line_271'>      unsuspecting brethren, and a new conformity to the acts of St.</a>
<a id='line_272'>      Paul may be found in the conversion of Simeon: like the apostle,</a>
<a id='line_273'>      he embraced the doctrine which he had been sent to persecute,</a>
<a id='line_274'>      renounced his honors and fortunes, and required among the</a>
<a id='line_275'>      Paulicians the fame of a missionary and a martyr. They were not</a>
<a id='line_276'>      ambitious of martyrdom, 15 but in a calamitous period of one</a>
<a id='line_277'>      hundred and fifty years, their patience sustained whatever zeal</a>
<a id='line_278'>      could inflict; and power was insufficient to eradicate the</a>
<a id='line_279'>      obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason. From the blood and</a>
<a id='line_280'>      ashes of the first victims, a succession of teachers and</a>
<a id='line_281'>      congregations repeatedly arose: amidst their foreign hostilities,</a>
<a id='line_282'>      they found leisure for domestic quarrels: they preached, they</a>
<a id='line_283'>      disputed, they suffered; and the virtues, the apparent virtues,</a>
<a id='line_284'>      of Sergius, in a pilgrimage of thirty-three years, are</a>
<a id='line_285'>      reluctantly confessed by the orthodox historians. 16 The native</a>
<a id='line_286'>      cruelty of Justinian the Second was stimulated by a pious cause;</a>
<a id='line_287'>      and he vainly hoped to extinguish, in a single conflagration, the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      name and memory of the Paulicians. By their primitive simplicity,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      their abhorrence of popular superstition, the Iconoclast princes</a>
<a id='line_290'>      might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines; but they</a>
<a id='line_291'>      themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks, and they</a>
<a id='line_292'>      chose to be the tyrants, lest they should be accused as the</a>
<a id='line_293'>      accomplices, of the Manichaeans. Such a reproach has sullied the</a>
<a id='line_294'>      clemency of Nicephorus, who relaxed in their favor the severity</a>
<a id='line_295'>      of the penal statutes, nor will his character sustain the honor</a>
<a id='line_296'>      of a more liberal motive. The feeble Michael the First, the rigid</a>
<a id='line_297'>      Leo the Armenian, were foremost in the race of persecution; but</a>
<a id='line_298'>      the prize must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion</a>
<a id='line_299'>      of Theodora, who restored the images to the Oriental church. Her</a>
<a id='line_300'>      inquisitors explored the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia,</a>
<a id='line_301'>      and the flatterers of the empress have affirmed that, in a short</a>
<a id='line_302'>      reign, one hundred thousand Paulicians were extirpated by the</a>
<a id='line_303'>      sword, the gibbet, or the flames. Her guilt or merit has perhaps</a>
<a id='line_304'>      been stretched beyond the measure of truth: but if the account be</a>
<a id='line_305'>      allowed, it must be presumed that many simple Iconoclasts were</a>
<a id='line_306'>      punished under a more odious name; and that some who were driven</a>

<a id='line_360'>      Calvinists of France, and such, in the ninth century, were the</a>
<a id='line_361'>      Paulicians of Armenia and the adjacent provinces. 17 They were</a>
<a id='line_362'>      first awakened to the massacre of a governor and bishop, who</a>
<a id='line_363'>      exercised the Imperial mandate of converting or destroying the</a>
<a id='line_364'>      heretics; and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus protected</a>
<a id='line_365'>      their independence and revenge. A more dangerous and consuming</a>
<a id='line_366'>      flame was kindled by the persecution of Theodora, and the revolt</a>
<a id='line_367'>      of Carbeas, a valiant Paulician, who commanded the guards of the</a>
<a id='line_368'>      general of the East. His father had been impaled by the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_369'>      inquisitors; and religion, or at least nature, might justify his</a>
<a id='line_370'>      desertion and revenge. Five thousand of his brethren were united</a>
<a id='line_371'>      by the same motives; they renounced the allegiance of</a>
<a id='line_372'>      anti-Christian Rome; a Saracen emir introduced Carbeas to the</a>
<a id='line_373'>      caliph; and the commander of the faithful extended his sceptre to</a>
<a id='line_374'>      the implacable enemy of the Greeks. In the mountains between</a>
<a id='line_375'>      Siwas and Trebizond he founded or fortified the city of Tephrice,</a>
<a id='line_376'>      18 which is still occupied by a fierce or licentious people, and</a>
<a id='line_377'>      the neighboring hills were covered with the Paulician fugitives,</a>
<a id='line_378'>      who now reconciled the use of the Bible and the sword. During</a>
<a id='line_379'>      more than thirty years, Asia was afflicted by the calamities of</a>
<a id='line_380'>      foreign and domestic war; in their hostile inroads, the disciples</a>
<a id='line_381'>      of St. Paul were joined with those of Mahomet; and the peaceful</a>
<a id='line_382'>      Christians, the aged parent and tender virgin, who were delivered</a>
<a id='line_383'>      into barbarous servitude, might justly accuse the intolerant</a>
<a id='line_384'>      spirit of their sovereign. So urgent was the mischief, so</a>
<a id='line_385'>      intolerable the shame, that even the dissolute Michael, the son</a>
<a id='line_386'>      of Theodora, was compelled to march in person against the</a>
<a id='line_387'>      Paulicians: he was defeated under the walls of Samosata; and the</a>
<a id='line_388'>      Roman emperor fled before the heretics whom his mother had</a>
<a id='line_389'>      condemned to the flames. The Saracens fought under the same</a>
<a id='line_390'>      banners, but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas; and the captive</a>
<a id='line_391'>      generals, with more than a hundred tribunes, were either released</a>
<a id='line_392'>      by his avarice, or tortured by his fanaticism. The valor and</a>
<a id='line_393'>      ambition of Chrysocheir, 19 his successor, embraced a wider</a>
<a id='line_394'>      circle of rapine and revenge. In alliance with his faithful</a>
<a id='line_395'>      Moslems, he boldly penetrated into the heart of Asia; the troops</a>
<a id='line_396'>      of the frontier and the palace were repeatedly overthrown; the</a>
<a id='line_397'>      edicts of persecution were answered by the pillage of Nice and</a>
<a id='line_398'>      Nicomedia, of Ancyra and Ephesus; nor could the apostle St. John</a>
<a id='line_399'>      protect from violation his city and sepulchre. The cathedral of</a>
<a id='line_400'>      Ephesus was turned into a stable for mules and horses; and the</a>
<a id='line_401'>      Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their contempt and</a>
<a id='line_402'>      abhorrence of images and relics. It is not unpleasing to observe</a>
<a id='line_403'>      the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which had</a>
<a id='line_404'>      disdained the prayers of an injured people. The emperor Basil,</a>
<a id='line_405'>      the Macedonian, was reduced to sue for peace, to offer a ransom</a>
<a id='line_406'>      for the captives, and to request, in the language of moderation</a>
<a id='line_407'>      and charity, that Chrysocheir would spare his fellow-Christians,</a>
<a id='line_408'>      and content himself with a royal donative of gold and silver and</a>
<a id='line_409'>      silk garments. “If the emperor,” replied the insolent fanatic,</a>
<a id='line_410'>      “be desirous of peace, let him abdicate the East, and reign</a>
<a id='line_411'>      without molestation in the West. If he refuse, the servants of</a>
<a id='line_412'>      the Lord will precipitate him from the throne.” The reluctant</a>
<a id='line_413'>      Basil suspended the treaty, accepted the defiance, and led his</a>
<a id='line_414'>      army into the land of heresy, which he wasted with fire and</a>
<a id='line_415'>      sword. The open country of the Paulicians was exposed to the same</a>
<a id='line_416'>      calamities which they had inflicted; but when he had explored the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      strength of Tephrice, the multitude of the Barbarians, and the</a>
<a id='line_418'>      ample magazines of arms and provisions, he desisted with a sigh</a>
<a id='line_419'>      from the hopeless siege. On his return to Constantinople, he</a>
<a id='line_420'>      labored, by the foundation of convents and churches, to secure</a>
<a id='line_421'>      the aid of his celestial patrons, of Michael the archangel and</a>
<a id='line_422'>      the prophet Elijah; and it was his daily prayer that he might</a>
<a id='line_423'>      live to transpierce, with three arrows, the head of his impious</a>
<a id='line_424'>      adversary. Beyond his expectations, the wish was accomplished:</a>
<a id='line_425'>      after a successful inroad, Chrysocheir was surprised and slain in</a>
<a id='line_426'>      his retreat; and the rebel’s head was triumphantly presented at</a>
<a id='line_427'>      the foot of the throne. On the reception of this welcome trophy,</a>
<a id='line_428'>      Basil instantly called for his bow, discharged three arrows with</a>
<a id='line_429'>      unerring aim, and accepted the applause of the court, who hailed</a>
<a id='line_430'>      the victory of the royal archer. With Chrysocheir, the glory of</a>
<a id='line_431'>      the Paulicians faded and withered: 20 on the second expedition of</a>
<a id='line_432'>      the emperor, the impregnable Tephrice, was deserted by the</a>
<a id='line_433'>      heretics, who sued for mercy or escaped to the borders. The city</a>
<a id='line_434'>      was ruined, but the spirit of independence survived in the</a>
<a id='line_435'>      mountains: the Paulicians defended, above a century, their</a>
<a id='line_436'>      religion and liberty, infested the Roman limits, and maintained</a>
<a id='line_437'>      their perpetual alliance with the enemies of the empire and the</a>

<a id='line_462'>      Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.—Part II.</a>
<a id='line_463'></a>
<a id='line_464'>      About the middle of the eight century, Constantine, surnamed</a>
<a id='line_465'>      Copronymus by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition</a>
<a id='line_466'>      into Armenia, and found, in the cities of Melitene and</a>
<a id='line_467'>      Theodosiopolis, a great number of Paulicians, his kindred</a>
<a id='line_468'>      heretics. As a favor, or punishment, he transplanted them from</a>
<a id='line_469'>      the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople and Thrace; and by</a>
<a id='line_470'>      this emigration their doctrine was introduced and diffused in</a>
<a id='line_471'>      Europe. 21 If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled</a>
<a id='line_472'>      with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep</a>
<a id='line_473'>      root in a foreign soil. The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the</a>
<a id='line_474'>      storms of persecution, maintained a secret correspondence with</a>
<a id='line_475'>      their Armenian brethren, and gave aid and comfort to their</a>
<a id='line_476'>      preachers, who solicited, not without success, the infant faith</a>
<a id='line_477'>      of the Bulgarians. 22 In the tenth century, they were restored</a>
<a id='line_478'>      and multiplied by a more powerful colony, which John Zimisces 23</a>
<a id='line_479'>      transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of Mount</a>
<a id='line_480'>      Haemus. The Oriental clergy who would have preferred the</a>
<a id='line_481'>      destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the</a>
<a id='line_482'>      Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their</a>
<a id='line_483'>      valor: their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with</a>
<a id='line_484'>      mischief; but, on the side of the Danube, against the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_485'>      of Scythia, their service might be useful, and their loss would</a>
<a id='line_486'>      be desirable. Their exile in a distant land was softened by a</a>
<a id='line_487'>      free toleration: the Paulicians held the city of Philippopolis</a>
<a id='line_488'>      and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were their subjects; the</a>
<a id='line_489'>      Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a line of</a>
<a id='line_490'>      villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native</a>
<a id='line_491'>      Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy.</a>
<a id='line_492'>      As long as they were awed by power and treated with moderation,</a>
<a id='line_493'>      their voluntary bands were distinguished in the armies of the</a>
<a id='line_494'>      empire; and the courage of these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever</a>
<a id='line_495'>      thirsty of human blood, is noticed with astonishment, and almost</a>
<a id='line_496'>      with reproach, by the pusillanimous Greeks. The same spirit</a>
<a id='line_497'>      rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they were easily</a>
<a id='line_498'>      provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were often</a>
<a id='line_499'>      violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy.</a>
<a id='line_500'>      In the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred</a>
<a id='line_501'>      Manichaeans deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus, 24 and</a>
<a id='line_502'>      retired to their native homes. He dissembled till the moment of</a>

<a id='line_504'>      punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment, confiscation,</a>
<a id='line_505'>      and baptism. In an interval of peace, the emperor undertook the</a>
<a id='line_506'>      pious office of reconciling them to the church and state: his</a>
<a id='line_507'>      winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the thirteenth</a>
<a id='line_508'>      apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed whole</a>
<a id='line_509'>      days and nights in theological controversy. His arguments were</a>
<a id='line_510'>      fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honors and rewards</a>
<a id='line_511'>      which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new city,</a>
<a id='line_512'>      surrounded with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified</a>
<a id='line_513'>      with his own name, was founded by Alexius for the residence of</a>
<a id='line_514'>      his vulgar converts. The important station of Philippopolis was</a>
<a id='line_515'>      wrested from their hands; the contumacious leaders were secured</a>
<a id='line_516'>      in a dungeon, or banished from their country; and their lives</a>
<a id='line_517'>      were spared by the prudence, rather than the mercy, of an</a>
<a id='line_518'>      emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt</a>
<a id='line_519'>      alive before the church of St. Sophia. 25 But the proud hope of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by</a>
<a id='line_521'>      the invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased to dissemble or</a>
<a id='line_522'>      refused to obey. After the departure and death of Alexius, they</a>
<a id='line_523'>      soon resumed their civil and religious laws. In the beginning of</a>
<a id='line_524'>      the thirteenth century, their pope or primate (a manifest</a>

<a id='line_526'>      Dalmatia, and governed, by his vicars, the filial congregations</a>
<a id='line_527'>      of Italy and France. 26 From that aera, a minute scrutiny might</a>
<a id='line_528'>      prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition. At the end of the</a>

<a id='line_589'>      and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of</a>
<a id='line_590'>      every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard, the</a>
<a id='line_591'>      Paulicians were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy</a>
<a id='line_592'>      and Sicily: in peace and war, they freely conversed with</a>
<a id='line_593'>      strangers and natives, and their opinions were silently</a>
<a id='line_594'>      propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms beyond the Alps. 28</a>
<a id='line_595'>      It was soon discovered, that many thousand Catholics of every</a>
<a id='line_596'>      rank, and of either sex, had embraced the Manichaean heresy; and</a>
<a id='line_597'>      the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the first</a>

<a id='line_599'>      innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread</a>
<a id='line_600'>      their branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred</a>
<a id='line_601'>      of idolatry and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal</a>
<a id='line_602'>      and presbyterian government; their various sects were</a>
<a id='line_603'>      discriminated by some fainter or darker shades of theology; but</a>
<a id='line_604'>      they generally agreed in the two principles, the contempt of the</a>
<a id='line_605'>      Old Testament and the denial of the body of Christ, either on the</a>
<a id='line_606'>      cross or in the eucharist. A confession of simple worship and</a>
<a id='line_607'>      blameless manners is extorted from their enemies; and so high was</a>
<a id='line_608'>      their standard of perfection, that the increasing congregations</a>
<a id='line_609'>      were divided into two classes of disciples, of those who</a>
<a id='line_610'>      practised, and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the</a>
<a id='line_611'>      Albigeois, 30 in the southern provinces of France, that the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      Paulicians were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes</a>
<a id='line_613'>      of martyrdom and revenge which had been displayed in the</a>
<a id='line_614'>      neighborhood of the Euphrates, were repeated in the thirteenth</a>
<a id='line_615'>      century on the banks of the Rhone. The laws of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_616'>      emperors were revived by Frederic the Second. The insurgents of</a>
<a id='line_617'>      Tephrice were represented by the barons and cities of Languedoc:</a>
<a id='line_618'>      Pope Innocent III. surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora. It</a>
<a id='line_619'>      was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of</a>

<a id='line_704'>      senses, of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first</a>

<a id='line_753'>      indifference. II. The chain of authority was broken, which</a>
<a id='line_754'>      restrains the bigot from thinking as he pleases, and the slave</a>
<a id='line_755'>      from speaking as he thinks: the popes, fathers, and councils,</a>
<a id='line_756'>      were no longer the supreme and infallible judges of the world;</a>
<a id='line_757'>      and each Christian was taught to acknowledge no law but the</a>
<a id='line_758'>      Scriptures, no interpreter but his own conscience. This freedom,</a>
<a id='line_759'>      however, was the consequence, rather than the design, of the</a>
<a id='line_760'>      Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding</a>
<a id='line_761'>      the tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal</a>
<a id='line_762'>      rigor their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of</a>
<a id='line_763'>      the magistrate to punish heretics with death. The pious or</a>
<a id='line_764'>      personal animosity of Calvin proscribed in Servetus 35 the guilt</a>
<a id='line_765'>      of his own rebellion; 36 and the flames of Smithfield, in which</a>
<a id='line_766'>      he was afterwards consumed, had been kindled for the Anabaptists</a>
<a id='line_767'>      by the zeal of Cranmer. 37 The nature of the tiger wa s the same,</a>
<a id='line_768'>      but he was gradually deprived of his teeth and fangs. A spiritual</a>
<a id='line_769'>      and temporal kingdom was possessed by the Roman pontiff; the</a>
<a id='line_770'>      Protestant doctors were subjects of an humble rank, without</a>
<a id='line_771'>      revenue or jurisdiction. His decrees were consecrated by the</a>
<a id='line_772'>      antiquity of the Catholic church: their arguments and disputes</a>
<a id='line_773'>      were submitted to the people; and their appeal to private</a>
<a id='line_774'>      judgment was accepted beyond their wishes, by curiosity and</a>
<a id='line_775'>      enthusiasm. Since the days of Luther and Calvin, a secret</a>
<a id='line_776'>      reformation has been silently working in the bosom of the</a>
<a id='line_777'>      reformed churches; many weeds of prejudice were eradicated; and</a>
<a id='line_778'>      the disciples of Erasmus 38 diffused a spirit of freedom and</a>
<a id='line_779'>      moderation. The liberty of conscience has been claimed as a</a>
<a id='line_780'>      common benefit, an inalienable right: 39 the free governments of</a>
<a id='line_781'>      Holland 40 and England 41 introduced the practice of toleration;</a>
<a id='line_782'>      and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by the</a>
<a id='line_783'>      prudence and humanity of the times. In the exercise, the mind has</a>
<a id='line_784'>      understood the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows</a>
<a id='line_785'>      that might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly</a>
<a id='line_786'>      reason. The volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs:</a>
<a id='line_787'>      the doctrine of a Protestant church is far removed from the</a>
<a id='line_788'>      knowledge or belief of its private members; and the forms of</a>
<a id='line_789'>      orthodoxy, the articles of faith, are subscribed with a sigh, or</a>
<a id='line_790'>      a smile, by the modern clergy. Yet the friends of Christianity</a>
<a id='line_791'>      are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scepticism.</a>
<a id='line_792'>      The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the web of</a>
