<a id='line_852'></a>
<a id='line_853'></a>
<a id='line_854'>And if so be ye can descrive what ye bear, ye are worthy to bear the</a>
<a id='line_855'>arms. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I will answer you; this shield</a>
<a id='line_856'>was given me, not desired, of Queen Morgan le Fay; and as for me, I can</a>
<a id='line_857'>not descrive these arms, for it is no point of my charge, and yet I</a>
<a id='line_858'>trust to God to bear them with worship. Truly, said King Arthur, ye</a>
<a id='line_859'>ought not to bear none arms but if ye wist what ye bear: but I pray you</a>
<a id='line_860'>tell me your name. To what intent? said Sir Tristram. For I would wit,</a>
<a id='line_861'>said Arthur. Sir, ye shall not wit as at this time. Then shall ye and I</a>
<a id='line_862'>do battle together, said King Arthur. Why, said Sir Tristram, will ye</a>
<a id='line_863'>do battle with me but if I tell you my name? and that little needeth</a>
<a id='line_864'>you an ye were a man of worship, for ye have seen me this day have had</a>
<a id='line_865'>great travail, and therefore ye are a villainous knight to ask battle</a>
<a id='line_866'>of me, considering my great travail; howbeit I will not fail you, and</a>
<a id='line_867'>have ye no doubt that I fear not you; though you think you have me at a</a>
<a id='line_868'>great advantage yet shall I right well endure you. And there withal</a>
<a id='line_869'>King Arthur dressed his shield and his spear, and Sir Tristram against</a>
<a id='line_870'>him, and they came so eagerly together. And there King Arthur brake his</a>
<a id='line_871'>spear all to pieces upon Sir Tristram’s shield. But Sir Tristram hit</a>
<a id='line_872'>Arthur again, that horse and man fell to the earth. And there was King</a>
<a id='line_873'>Arthur wounded on the left side, a great wound and a perilous.</a>
<a id='line_874'></a>
<a id='line_875'>Then when Sir Uwaine saw his lord Arthur lie on the ground sore</a>
<a id='line_876'>wounded, he was passing heavy. And then he dressed his shield and his</a>
<a id='line_877'>spear, and cried aloud unto Sir Tristram and said: Knight, defend thee.</a>
<a id='line_878'>So they came together as thunder, and Sir Uwaine brised his spear all</a>
<a id='line_879'>to pieces upon Sir Tristram’s shield, and Sir Tristram smote him harder</a>
<a id='line_880'>and sorer, with such a might that he bare him clean out of his saddle</a>
<a id='line_881'>to the earth. With that Sir Tristram turned about and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_882'>knights, I had no need to joust with you, for I have had enough to do</a>
<a id='line_883'>this day. Then arose Arthur and went to Sir Uwaine, and said to Sir</a>
<a id='line_884'>Tristram: We have as we have deserved, for through our orgulyté we</a>
<a id='line_885'>demanded battle of you, and yet we knew not your name. Nevertheless, by</a>
<a id='line_886'>Saint Cross, said Sir Uwaine, he is a strong knight at mine advice as</a>
<a id='line_887'>any is now living.</a>
<a id='line_888'></a>
<a id='line_889'>Then Sir Tristram departed, and in every place he asked and demanded</a>
<a id='line_890'>after Sir Launcelot, but in no place he could not hear of him whether</a>
<a id='line_891'>he were dead or alive; wherefore Sir Tristram made great dole and</a>
<a id='line_892'>sorrow. So Sir Tristram rode by a forest, and then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_893'>fair tower by a marsh on that one side, and on that other side a fair</a>
<a id='line_894'>meadow. And there he saw ten knights fighting together. And ever the</a>
<a id='line_895'>nearer he came he saw how there was but one knight did battle against</a>
<a id='line_896'>nine knights, and that one did so marvellously that Sir Tristram had</a>
<a id='line_897'>great wonder that ever one knight might do so great deeds of arms. And</a>
<a id='line_898'>then within a little while he had slain half their horses and unhorsed</a>
<a id='line_899'>them, and their horses ran in the fields and forest. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_900'>had so great pity of that one knight that endured so great pain, and</a>
<a id='line_901'>ever he thought it should be Sir Palomides, by his shield. And so he</a>
<a id='line_902'>rode unto the knights and cried unto them, and bade them cease of their</a>
<a id='line_903'>battle, for they did themselves great shame so many knights to fight</a>
<a id='line_904'>with one. Then answered the master of those knights, his name was</a>
<a id='line_905'>called Breuse Saunce Pité, that was at that time the most mischievoust</a>
<a id='line_906'>knight living, and said thus: Sir knight, what have ye ado with us to</a>
<a id='line_907'>meddle? and therefore, an ye be wise, depart on your way as ye came,</a>
<a id='line_908'>for this knight shall not escape us. That were pity, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_909'>that so good a knight as he is should be slain so cowardly; and</a>
<a id='line_910'>therefore I warn you I will succour him with all my puissance.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>

<a id='line_915'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Tristram saved Sir Palomides’ life, and how they</a>
<a id='line_916'>promised to fight together within a fortnight.</a>
<a id='line_917'></a>
<a id='line_918'></a>
<a id='line_919'>So Sir Tristram alighted off his horse because they were on foot, that</a>
<a id='line_920'>they should not slay his horse, and then dressed his shield, with his</a>
<a id='line_921'>sword in his hand, and he smote on the right hand and on the left hand</a>
<a id='line_922'>passing sore, that well-nigh at every stroke he struck down a knight.</a>
<a id='line_923'>And when they espied his strokes they fled all with Breuse Saunce Pité</a>
<a id='line_924'>unto the tower, and Sir Tristram followed fast after with his sword in</a>
<a id='line_925'>his hand, but they escaped into the tower, and shut Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_926'>without the gate. And when Sir Tristram saw this he returned aback unto</a>
<a id='line_927'>Sir Palomides, and found him sitting under a tree sore wounded. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_928'>fair knight, said Sir Tristram, well be ye found. Gramercy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_929'>Palomides, of your great goodness, for ye have rescued me of my life,</a>
<a id='line_930'>and saved me from my death. What is your name? said Sir Tristram. He</a>
<a id='line_931'>said: My name is Sir Palomides. O Jesu, said Sir Tristram, thou hast a</a>
<a id='line_932'>fair grace of me this day that I should rescue thee, and thou art the</a>
<a id='line_933'>man in the world that I most hate; but now make thee ready, for I will</a>
<a id='line_934'>do battle with thee. What is your name? said Sir Palomides. My name is</a>
<a id='line_935'>Sir Tristram, your mortal enemy. It may be so, said Sir Palomides; but</a>
<a id='line_936'>ye have done over much for me this day that I should fight with you;</a>
<a id='line_937'>for inasmuch as ye have saved my life it will be no worship for you to</a>
<a id='line_938'>have ado with me, for ye are fresh and I am wounded sore, and</a>
<a id='line_939'>therefore, an ye will needs have ado with me, assign me a day and then</a>
<a id='line_940'>I shall meet with you without fail. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, now</a>
<a id='line_941'>I assign you to meet me in the meadow by the river of Camelot, where</a>
<a id='line_942'>Merlin set the peron. So they were agreed.</a>
<a id='line_943'></a>
<a id='line_944'>Then Sir Tristram asked Sir Palomides why the ten knights did battle</a>
<a id='line_945'>with him. For this cause, said Sir Palomides; as I rode upon mine</a>
<a id='line_946'>adventures in a forest here beside I espied where lay a dead knight,</a>
<a id='line_947'>and a lady weeping beside him. And when I saw her making such dole, I</a>
<a id='line_948'>asked her who slew her lord. Sir, she said, the falsest knight of the</a>
<a id='line_949'>world now living, and he is the most villain that ever man heard speak</a>
<a id='line_950'>of and his name is Sir Breuse Saunce Pité. Then for pity I made the</a>
<a id='line_951'>damosel to leap on her palfrey, and I promised her to be her warrant,</a>
<a id='line_952'>and to help her to inter her lord. And so, suddenly, as I came riding</a>
<a id='line_953'>by this tower, there came out Sir Breuse Saunce Pité, and suddenly he</a>
<a id='line_954'>struck me from my horse. And then or I might recover my horse this Sir</a>
<a id='line_955'>Breuse slew the damosel. And so I took my horse again, and I was sore</a>
<a id='line_956'>ashamed, and so began the medley betwixt us: and this is the cause</a>
<a id='line_957'>wherefore we did this battle. Well, said Sir Tristram, now I understand</a>
<a id='line_958'>the manner of your battle, but in any wise have remembrance of your</a>
<a id='line_959'>promise that ye have made with me to do battle with me this day</a>
<a id='line_960'>fortnight. I shall not fail you, said Sir Palomides. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_961'>Tristram, as at this time I will not fail you till that ye be out of</a>
<a id='line_962'>the danger of your enemies.</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>So they mounted upon their horses, and rode together unto that forest,</a>
<a id='line_965'>and there they found a fair well, with clear water bubbling. Fair sir,</a>
<a id='line_966'>said Sir Tristram, to drink of that water have I courage; and then they</a>
<a id='line_967'>alighted off their horses. And then were they ware by them where stood</a>
<a id='line_968'>a great horse tied to a tree, and ever he neighed. And then were they</a>
<a id='line_969'>ware of a fair knight armed, under a tree, lacking no piece of harness,</a>
<a id='line_970'>save his helm lay under his head. By the good lord, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_971'>yonder lieth a well-faring knight; what is best to do? Awake him, said</a>
<a id='line_972'>Sir Palomides. So Sir Tristram awaked him with the butt of his spear.</a>
<a id='line_973'>And so the knight rose up hastily and put his helm upon his head, and</a>
<a id='line_974'>gat a great spear in his hand; and without any more words he hurled</a>
<a id='line_975'>unto Sir Tristram, and smote him clean from his saddle to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_976'>and hurt him on the left side, that Sir Tristram lay in great peril.</a>
<a id='line_977'>Then he walloped farther, and fetched his course, and came hurling upon</a>
<a id='line_978'>Sir Palomides, and there he struck him a part through the body, that he</a>
<a id='line_979'>fell from his horse to the earth. And then this strange knight left</a>
<a id='line_980'>them there, and took his way through the forest. With this Sir</a>
<a id='line_981'>Palomides and Sir Tristram were on foot, and gat their horses again,</a>
<a id='line_982'>and either asked counsel of other, what was best to do. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_983'>said Sir Tristram, I will follow this strong knight that thus hath</a>
<a id='line_984'>shamed us. Well, said Sir Palomides, and I will repose me hereby with a</a>
<a id='line_985'>friend of mine. Beware, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, that ye fail</a>
<a id='line_986'>not that day that ye have set with me to do battle, for, as I deem, ye</a>
<a id='line_987'>will not hold your day, for I am much bigger than ye. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_988'>Sir Palomides, be it as it be may, for I fear you not, for an I be not</a>
<a id='line_989'>sick nor prisoner, I will not fail you; but I have cause to have more</a>
<a id='line_990'>doubt of you that ye will not meet with me, for ye ride after yonder</a>
<a id='line_991'>strong knight. And if ye meet with him it is an hard adventure an ever</a>
<a id='line_992'>ye escape his hands. Right so Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides departed,</a>
<a id='line_993'>and either took their ways diverse.</a>
<a id='line_994'></a>

<a id='line_1000'></a>
<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>And so Sir Tristram rode long after this strong knight. And at the last</a>
<a id='line_1003'>he saw where lay a lady overthwart a dead knight. Fair lady, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1004'>Tristram, who hath slain your lord? Sir, she said, here came a knight</a>
<a id='line_1005'>riding, as my lord and I rested us here, and asked him of whence he</a>
<a id='line_1006'>was, and my lord said of Arthur’s court. Therefore, said the strong</a>
<a id='line_1007'>knight, I will joust with thee, for I hate all these that be of</a>
<a id='line_1008'>Arthur’s court. And my lord that lieth here dead amounted upon his</a>
<a id='line_1009'>horse, and the strong knight and my lord encountered together, and</a>
<a id='line_1010'>there he smote my lord throughout with his spear, and thus he hath</a>
<a id='line_1011'>brought me in great woe and damage. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1012'>Tristram, of your great anger; an it please you tell me your husband’s</a>
<a id='line_1013'>name. Sir, said she, his name was Galardoun, that would have proved a</a>
<a id='line_1014'>good knight. So departed Sir Tristram from that dolorous lady, and had</a>
<a id='line_1015'>much evil lodging. Then on the third day Sir Tristram met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_1016'>Gawaine and with Sir Bleoberis in a forest at a lodge, and either were</a>
<a id='line_1017'>sore wounded. Then Sir Tristram asked Sir Gawaine and Sir Bleoberis if</a>
<a id='line_1018'>they met with such a knight, with such a cognisance, with a covered</a>
<a id='line_1019'>shield. Fair sir, said these knights, such a knight met with us to our</a>
<a id='line_1020'>great damage. And first he smote down my fellow, Sir Bleoberis, and</a>
<a id='line_1021'>sore wounded him because he bade me I should not have ado with him, for</a>
<a id='line_1022'>why he was overstrong for me. That strong knight took his words at</a>
<a id='line_1023'>scorn, and said he said it for mockery. And then they rode together,</a>
<a id='line_1024'>and so he hurt my fellow. And when he had done so I might not for shame</a>
<a id='line_1025'>but I must joust with him. And at the first course he smote me down and</a>
<a id='line_1026'>my horse to the earth. And there he had almost slain me, and from us he</a>
<a id='line_1027'>took his horse and departed, and in an evil time we met with him. Fair</a>
<a id='line_1028'>knights, said Sir Tristram, so he met with me, and with another knight</a>
<a id='line_1029'>that hight Palomides, and he smote us both down with one spear, and</a>
<a id='line_1030'>hurt us right sore. By my faith, said Sir Gawaine, by my counsel ye</a>
<a id='line_1031'>shall let him pass and seek him no further; for at the next feast of</a>
<a id='line_1032'>the Round Table, upon pain of my head ye shall find him there. By my</a>
<a id='line_1033'>faith, said Sir Tristram, I shall never rest till that I find him. And</a>
<a id='line_1034'>then Sir Gawaine asked him his name. Then he said: My name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_1035'>Tristram. And so either told other their names, and then departed Sir</a>
<a id='line_1036'>Tristram and rode his way.</a>
<a id='line_1037'></a>
<a id='line_1038'>And by fortune in a meadow Sir Tristram met with Sir Kay, the</a>
<a id='line_1039'>Seneschal, and Sir Dinadan. What tidings with you, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_1040'>with you knights? Not good, said these knights. Why so? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1041'>Tristram; I pray you tell me, for I ride to seek a knight. What</a>
<a id='line_1042'>cognisance beareth he? said Sir Kay. He beareth, said Sir Tristram, a</a>
<a id='line_1043'>covered shield close with cloth. By my head, said Sir Kay, that is the</a>
<a id='line_1044'>same knight that met with us, for this night we were lodged within a</a>
<a id='line_1045'>widow’s house, and there was that knight lodged; and when he wist we</a>
<a id='line_1046'>were of Arthur’s court he spoke great villainy by the king, and</a>
<a id='line_1047'>specially by the Queen Guenever, and then on the morn was waged battle</a>
<a id='line_1048'>with him for that cause. And at the first recounter, said Sir Kay, he</a>
<a id='line_1049'>smote me down from my horse and hurt me passing sore; and when my</a>
<a id='line_1050'>fellow, Sir Dinadan, saw me smitten down and hurt he would not revenge</a>
<a id='line_1051'>me, but fled from me; and thus he departed. And then Sir Tristram asked</a>
<a id='line_1052'>them their names, and so either told other their names. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_1053'>Tristram departed from Sir Kay, and from Sir Dinadan, and so he passed</a>
<a id='line_1054'>through a great forest into a plain, till he was ware of a priory, and</a>
<a id='line_1055'>there he reposed him with a good man six days.</a>
<a id='line_1056'></a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'></a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le Desirous and</a>
<a id='line_1061'>Sir Dodinas le Savage.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'></a>
<a id='line_1064'>And then he sent his man that hight Gouvernail, and commanded him to go</a>
<a id='line_1065'>to a city thereby to fetch him new harness; for it was long time afore</a>
<a id='line_1066'>that that Sir Tristram had been refreshed, his harness was brised and</a>
<a id='line_1067'>broken. And when Gouvernail, his servant, was come with his apparel, he</a>
<a id='line_1068'>took his leave at the widow, and mounted upon his horse, and rode his</a>
<a id='line_1069'>way early on the morn. And by sudden adventure Sir Tristram met with</a>
<a id='line_1070'>Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and with Sir Dodinas le Savage. And these</a>
<a id='line_1071'>two knights met with Sir Tristram and questioned with him, and asked</a>
<a id='line_1072'>him if he would joust with them. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, with</a>
<a id='line_1073'>a good will I would joust with you, but I have promised at a day set,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>near hand, to do battle with a strong knight; and therefore I am loath</a>
<a id='line_1075'>to have ado with you, for an it misfortuned me here to be hurt I should</a>
<a id='line_1076'>not be able to do my battle which I promised. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_1077'>Sagramore, maugre your head, ye shall joust with us or ye pass from us.</a>
<a id='line_1078'>Well, said Sir Tristram, if ye enforce me thereto I must do what I may.</a>
<a id='line_1079'>And then they dressed their shields, and came running together with</a>
<a id='line_1080'>great ire. But through Sir Tristram’s great force he struck Sir</a>
<a id='line_1081'>Sagramore from his horse. Then he hurled his horse farther, and said to</a>
<a id='line_1082'>Sir Dodinas: Knight, make thee ready; and so through fine force Sir</a>
<a id='line_1083'>Tristram struck Dodinas from his horse. And when he saw them lie on the</a>
<a id='line_1084'>earth he took his bridle, and rode forth on his way, and his man</a>
<a id='line_1085'>Gouvernail with him.</a>
<a id='line_1086'></a>
<a id='line_1087'>Anon as Sir Tristram was passed, Sir Sagramore and Sir Dodinas gat</a>
<a id='line_1088'>again their horses, and mounted up lightly and followed after Sir</a>
<a id='line_1089'>Tristram. And when Sir Tristram saw them come so fast after him he</a>
<a id='line_1090'>returned with his horse to them, and asked them what they would. It is</a>
<a id='line_1091'>not long ago sithen I smote you to the earth at your own request and</a>
<a id='line_1092'>desire: I would have ridden by you, but ye would not suffer me, and now</a>
<a id='line_1093'>meseemeth ye would do more battle with me. That is truth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1094'>Sagramore and Sir Dodinas, for we will be revenged of the despite ye</a>
<a id='line_1095'>have done to us. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, that shall little</a>
<a id='line_1096'>need you, for all that I did to you ye caused it; wherefore I require</a>
<a id='line_1097'>you of your knighthood leave me as at this time, for I am sure an I do</a>
<a id='line_1098'>battle with you I shall not escape without great hurts, and as I</a>
<a id='line_1099'>suppose ye shall not escape all lotless. And this is the cause why I am</a>
<a id='line_1100'>so loath to have ado with you; for I must fight within these three days</a>
<a id='line_1101'>with a good knight, and as valiant as any is now living, and if I be</a>
<a id='line_1102'>hurt I shall not be able to do battle with him. What knight is that,</a>
<a id='line_1103'>said Sir Sagramore, that ye shall fight withal? Sirs, said he, it is a</a>
<a id='line_1104'>good knight called Sir Palomides. By my head, said Sir Sagramore and</a>
<a id='line_1105'>Sir Dodinas, ye have cause to dread him, for ye shall find him a</a>
<a id='line_1106'>passing good knight, and a valiant. And because ye shall have ado with</a>
<a id='line_1107'>him we will forbear you as at this time, and else ye should not escape</a>
<a id='line_1108'>us lightly. But, fair knight, said Sir Sagramore, tell us your name.</a>
<a id='line_1109'>Sir, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Sagramore and</a>
<a id='line_1110'>Sir Dodinas, well be ye found, for much worship have we heard of you.</a>
<a id='line_1111'>And then either took leave of other, and departed on their way.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>

<a id='line_1115'></a>
<a id='line_1116'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Tristram met at the peron with Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_1117'>how they fought together unknown.</a>
<a id='line_1118'></a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>Then departed Sir Tristram and rode straight unto Camelot, to the peron</a>
<a id='line_1121'>that Merlin had made to-fore, where Sir Lanceor, that was the king’s</a>
<a id='line_1122'>son of Ireland, was slain by the hands of Balin. And in that same place</a>
<a id='line_1123'>was the fair lady Colombe slain, that was love unto Sir Lanceor; for</a>
<a id='line_1124'>after he was dead she took his sword and thrust it through her body.</a>
<a id='line_1125'>And by the craft of Merlin he made to inter this knight, Lanceor, and</a>
<a id='line_1126'>his lady, Colombe, under one stone. And at that time Merlin prophesied</a>
<a id='line_1127'>that in that same place should fight two the best knights that ever</a>
<a id='line_1128'>were in Arthur’s days, and the best lovers. So when Sir Tristram came</a>
<a id='line_1129'>to the tomb where Lanceor and his lady were buried he looked about him</a>
<a id='line_1130'>after Sir Palomides. Then was he ware of a seemly knight came riding</a>
<a id='line_1131'>against him all in white, with a covered shield. When he came nigh Sir</a>
<a id='line_1132'>Tristram he said on high: Ye be welcome, sir knight, and well and truly</a>
<a id='line_1133'>have ye holden your promise. And then they dressed their shields and</a>
<a id='line_1134'>spears, and came together with all their might of their horses; and</a>
<a id='line_1135'>they met so fiercely that both their horses and knights fell to the</a>
<a id='line_1136'>earth, and as fast as they might avoided their horses, and put their</a>
<a id='line_1137'>shields afore them; and they struck together with bright swords, as men</a>
<a id='line_1138'>that were of might, and either wounded other wonderly sore, that the</a>
<a id='line_1139'>blood ran out upon the grass. And thus they fought the space of four</a>
<a id='line_1140'>hours, that never one would speak to other one word, and of their</a>
<a id='line_1141'>harness they had hewn off many pieces. O Lord Jesu, said Gouvernail, I</a>
<a id='line_1142'>marvel greatly of the strokes my master hath given to your master. By</a>
<a id='line_1143'>my head, said Sir Launcelot’s servant, your master hath not given so</a>
<a id='line_1144'>many but your master has received as many or more. O Jesu, said</a>
<a id='line_1145'>Gouvernail, it is too much for Sir Palomides to suffer or Sir</a>
<a id='line_1146'>Launcelot, and yet pity it were that either of these good knights</a>
<a id='line_1147'>should destroy other’s blood. So they stood and wept both, and made</a>
<a id='line_1148'>great dole when they saw the bright swords over-covered with blood of</a>
<a id='line_1149'>their bodies.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>Then at the last spake Sir Launcelot and said: Knight, thou fightest</a>
<a id='line_1152'>wonderly well as ever I saw knight, therefore, an it please you, tell</a>
<a id='line_1153'>me your name. Sir, said Sir Tristram, that is me loath to tell any man</a>
<a id='line_1154'>my name. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, an I were required I was never</a>
<a id='line_1155'>loath to tell my name. It is well said, said Sir Tristram, then I</a>
<a id='line_1156'>require you to tell me your name? Fair knight, he said, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_1157'>Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Tristram, what have I done! for ye</a>
<a id='line_1158'>are the man in the world that I love best. Fair knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1159'>Launcelot, tell me your name? Truly, said he, my name is Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1160'>de Liones. O Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, what adventure is befallen me!</a>
<a id='line_1161'>And therewith Sir Launcelot kneeled down and yielded him up his sword.</a>
<a id='line_1162'>And therewith Sir Tristram kneeled adown, and yielded him up his sword.</a>
<a id='line_1163'>And so either gave other the degree. And then they both forthwithal</a>
<a id='line_1164'>went to the stone, and set them down upon it, and took off their helms</a>
<a id='line_1165'>to cool them, and either kissed other an hundred times. And then anon</a>
<a id='line_1166'>after they took off their helms and rode to Camelot. And there they met</a>
<a id='line_1167'>with Sir Gawaine and with Sir Gaheris that had made promise to Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1168'>never to come again to the court till they had brought Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1169'>with them.</a>

<a id='line_1174'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram to the court, and of</a>
<a id='line_1175'>the great joy that the king and other made for the coming of Sir</a>
<a id='line_1176'>Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_1177'></a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>Return again, said Sir Launcelot, for your quest is done, for I have</a>
<a id='line_1180'>met with Sir Tristram: lo, here is his own person! Then was Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_1181'>glad, and said to Sir Tristram: Ye are welcome, for now have ye eased</a>
<a id='line_1182'>me greatly of my labour. For what cause, said Sir Gawaine, came ye into</a>
<a id='line_1183'>this court? Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, I came into this country</a>
<a id='line_1184'>because of Sir Palomides; for he and I had assigned at this day to have</a>
<a id='line_1185'>done battle together at the peron, and I marvel I hear not of him. And</a>
<a id='line_1186'>thus by adventure my lord, Sir Launcelot, and I met together. With this</a>
<a id='line_1187'>came King Arthur, and when he wist that there was Sir Tristram, then he</a>
<a id='line_1188'>ran unto him and took him by the hand and said: Sir Tristram, ye are as</a>
<a id='line_1189'>welcome as any knight that ever came to this court. And when the king</a>
<a id='line_1190'>had heard how Sir Launcelot and he had foughten, and either had wounded</a>
<a id='line_1191'>other wonderly sore, then the king made great dole. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1192'>told the king how he came thither for to have had ado with Sir</a>
<a id='line_1193'>Palomides. And then he told the king how he had rescued him from the</a>
<a id='line_1194'>nine knights and Breuse Saunce Pité; and how he found a knight lying by</a>
<a id='line_1195'>a well, and that knight smote down Sir Palomides and me, but his shield</a>
<a id='line_1196'>was covered with a cloth. So Sir Palomides left me, and I followed</a>
<a id='line_1197'>after that knight; and in many places I found where he had slain</a>
<a id='line_1198'>knights, and forjousted many. By my head, said Sir Gawaine, that same</a>
<a id='line_1199'>knight smote me down and Sir Bleoberis, and hurt us sore both, he with</a>
<a id='line_1200'>the covered shield. Ah, said Sir Kay, that knight smote me adown and</a>
<a id='line_1201'>hurt me passing sore, and fain would I have known him, but I might not.</a>
<a id='line_1202'>Jesu, mercy, said Arthur, what knight was that with the covered shield?</a>
<a id='line_1203'>I know not, said Sir Tristram; and so said they all. Now, said King</a>
<a id='line_1204'>Arthur, then wot I, for it is Sir Launcelot. Then they all looked upon</a>
<a id='line_1205'>Sir Launcelot and said: Ye have beguiled us with your covered shield.</a>
<a id='line_1206'>It is not the first time, said Arthur, he hath done so. My lord, said</a>
<a id='line_1207'>Sir Launcelot, truly wit ye well I was the same knight that bare the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>covered shield; and because I would not be known that I was of your</a>
<a id='line_1209'>court I said no worship of your house. That is truth, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_1210'>Sir Kay, and Sir Bleoberis.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>Then King Arthur took Sir Tristram by the hand and went to the Table</a>
<a id='line_1213'>Round. Then came Queen Guenever and many ladies with her, and all the</a>
<a id='line_1214'>ladies said at one voice: Welcome, Sir Tristram! Welcome, said the</a>
<a id='line_1215'>damosels. Welcome, said knights. Welcome, said Arthur, for one of the</a>
<a id='line_1216'>best knights, and the gentlest of the world, and the man of most</a>
<a id='line_1217'>worship; for of all manner of hunting thou bearest the prize, and of</a>
<a id='line_1218'>all measures of blowing thou art the beginning, and of all the terms of</a>
<a id='line_1219'>hunting and hawking ye are the beginner, of all instruments of music ye</a>
<a id='line_1220'>are the best; therefore, gentle knight, said Arthur, ye are welcome to</a>
<a id='line_1221'>this court. And also, I pray you, said Arthur, grant me a boon. It</a>
<a id='line_1222'>shall be at your commandment, said Tristram. Well, said Arthur, I will</a>
<a id='line_1223'>desire of you that ye will abide in my court. Sir, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_1224'>thereto is me loath, for I have ado in many countries. Not so, said</a>
<a id='line_1225'>Arthur, ye have promised it me, ye may not say nay. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1226'>Tristram, I will as ye will. Then went Arthur unto the sieges about the</a>
<a id='line_1227'>Round Table, and looked in every siege the which were void that lacked</a>
<a id='line_1228'>knights. And then the king saw in the siege of Marhaus letters that</a>
<a id='line_1229'>said: This is the siege of the noble knight, Sir Tristram. And then</a>
<a id='line_1230'>Arthur made Sir Tristram Knight of the Table Round, with great nobley</a>
<a id='line_1231'>and great feast as might be thought. For Sir Marhaus was slain afore by</a>
<a id='line_1232'>the hands of Sir Tristram in an island; and that was well known at that</a>
<a id='line_1233'>time in the court of Arthur, for this Marhaus was a worthy knight. And</a>
<a id='line_1234'>for evil deeds that he did unto the country of Cornwall Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1235'>and he fought. And they fought so long, tracing and traversing, till</a>
<a id='line_1236'>they fell bleeding to the earth; for they were so sore wounded that</a>
<a id='line_1237'>they might not stand for bleeding. And Sir Tristram by fortune</a>
<a id='line_1238'>recovered, and Sir Marhaus died through the stroke on the head. So</a>
<a id='line_1239'>leave we of Sir Tristram and speak we of King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>

<a id='line_1243'></a>
<a id='line_1244'>CHAPTER VII. How for the despite of Sir Tristram King Mark came with</a>
<a id='line_1245'>two knights into England, and how he slew one of the knights.</a>
<a id='line_1246'></a>
<a id='line_1247'></a>
<a id='line_1248'>Then King Mark had great despite of the renown of Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_1249'>then he chased him out of Cornwall: yet was he nephew unto King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_1250'>but he had great suspicion unto Sir Tristram because of his queen, La</a>
<a id='line_1251'>Beale Isoud; for him seemed that there was too much love between them</a>
<a id='line_1252'>both. So when Sir Tristram departed out of Cornwall into England King</a>
<a id='line_1253'>Mark heard of the great prowess that Sir Tristram did there, the which</a>
<a id='line_1254'>grieved him sore. So he sent on his part men to espy what deeds he did.</a>
<a id='line_1255'>And the queen sent privily on her part spies to know what deeds he had</a>
<a id='line_1256'>done, for great love was between them twain. So when the messengers</a>
<a id='line_1257'>were come home they told the truth as they had heard, that he passed</a>
<a id='line_1258'>all other knights but if it were Sir Launcelot. Then King Mark was</a>
<a id='line_1259'>right heavy of these tidings, and as glad was La Beale Isoud. Then in</a>
<a id='line_1260'>great despite he took with him two good knights and two squires, and</a>
<a id='line_1261'>disguised himself, and took his way into England, to the intent for to</a>
<a id='line_1262'>slay Sir Tristram. And one of these two knights hight Bersules, and the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>other knight was called Amant. So as they rode King Mark asked a knight</a>
<a id='line_1264'>that he met, where he should find King Arthur. He said: At Camelot.</a>
<a id='line_1265'>Also he asked that knight after Sir Tristram, whether he heard of him</a>
<a id='line_1266'>in the court of King Arthur. Wit you well, said that knight, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1267'>find Sir Tristram there for a man of as great worship as is now living;</a>
<a id='line_1268'>for through his prowess he won the tournament of the Castle of Maidens</a>
<a id='line_1269'>that standeth by the Hard Rock. And sithen he hath won with his own</a>
<a id='line_1270'>hands thirty knights that were men of great honour. And the last battle</a>
<a id='line_1271'>that ever he did he fought with Sir Launcelot; and that was a</a>
<a id='line_1272'>marvellous battle. And not by force Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1273'>to the court, and of him King Arthur made passing great joy, and so</a>
<a id='line_1274'>made him Knight of the Table Round; and his seat was where the good</a>
<a id='line_1275'>knight’s, Sir Marhaus, seat was. Then was King Mark passing sorry when</a>
<a id='line_1276'>he heard of the honour of Sir Tristram; and so they departed.</a>
<a id='line_1277'></a>
<a id='line_1278'>Then said King Mark unto his two knights: Now will I tell you my</a>
<a id='line_1279'>counsel: ye are the men that I trust most to alive, and I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_1280'>wit my coming hither is to this intent, for to destroy Sir Tristram by</a>
<a id='line_1281'>wiles or by treason; and it shall be hard if ever he escape our hands.</a>
<a id='line_1282'>Alas, said Sir Bersules, what mean you? for ye be set in such a way ye</a>
<a id='line_1283'>are disposed shamefully; for Sir Tristram is the knight of most worship</a>
<a id='line_1284'>that we know living, and therefore I warn you plainly I will never</a>
<a id='line_1285'>consent to do him to the death; and therefore I will yield my service,</a>
<a id='line_1286'>and forsake you. When King Mark heard him say so, suddenly he drew his</a>
<a id='line_1287'>sword and said: Ah, traitor; and smote Sir Bersules on the head, that</a>
<a id='line_1288'>the sword went to his teeth. When Amant, the knight, saw him do that</a>
<a id='line_1289'>villainous deed, and his squires, they said it was foul done, and</a>
<a id='line_1290'>mischievously: Wherefore we will do thee no more service, and wit ye</a>
<a id='line_1291'>well, we will appeach thee of treason afore Arthur. Then was King Mark</a>
<a id='line_1292'>wonderly wroth and would have slain Amant; but he and the two squires</a>
<a id='line_1293'>held them together, and set nought by his malice. When King Mark saw he</a>
<a id='line_1294'>might not be revenged on them, he said thus unto the knight, Amant: Wit</a>
<a id='line_1295'>thou well, an thou appeach me of treason I shall thereof defend me</a>
<a id='line_1296'>afore King Arthur; but I require thee that thou tell not my name, that</a>
<a id='line_1297'>I am King Mark, whatsomever come of me. As for that, said Sir Amant, I</a>
<a id='line_1298'>will not discover your name; and so they departed, and Amant and his</a>
<a id='line_1299'>fellows took the body of Bersules and buried it.</a>
<a id='line_1300'></a>
<a id='line_1301'></a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>CHAPTER VIII. How King Mark came to a fountain where he found Sir</a>
<a id='line_1305'>Lamorak complaining for the love of King Lot’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_1306'></a>
<a id='line_1307'></a>
<a id='line_1308'>Then King Mark rode till he came to a fountain, and there he rested</a>
<a id='line_1309'>him, and stood in a doubt whether he would ride to Arthur’s court or</a>
<a id='line_1310'>none, or return again to his country. And as he thus rested him by that</a>
<a id='line_1311'>fountain there came by him a knight well armed on horseback; and he</a>
<a id='line_1312'>alighted, and tied his horse until a tree, and set him down by the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>brink of the fountain; and there he made great languor and dole, and</a>
<a id='line_1314'>made the dolefullest complaint of love that ever man heard; and all</a>
<a id='line_1315'>this while was he not ware of King Mark. And this was a great part of</a>
<a id='line_1316'>his complaint: he cried and wept, saying: O fair Queen of Orkney, King</a>
<a id='line_1317'>Lot’s wife, and mother of Sir Gawaine, and to Sir Gaheris, and mother</a>
<a id='line_1318'>to many other, for thy love I am in great pains. Then King Mark arose</a>
<a id='line_1319'>and went near him and said: Fair knight, ye have made a piteous</a>
<a id='line_1320'>complaint. Truly, said the knight, it is an hundred part more ruefuller</a>
<a id='line_1321'>than my heart can utter. I require you, said King Mark, tell me your</a>
<a id='line_1322'>name. Sir, said he, as for my name I will not hide it from no knight</a>
<a id='line_1323'>that beareth a shield, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. But when</a>
<a id='line_1324'>Sir Lamorak heard King Mark speak, then wist he well by his speech that</a>
<a id='line_1325'>he was a Cornish knight. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I understand by your</a>
<a id='line_1326'>tongue ye be of Cornwall, wherein there dwelleth the shamefullest king</a>
<a id='line_1327'>that is now living, for he is a great enemy to all good knights; and</a>
<a id='line_1328'>that proveth well, for he hath chased out of that country Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_1329'>that is the worshipfullest knight that now is living, and all knights</a>
<a id='line_1330'>speak of him worship; and for jealousness of his queen he hath chased</a>
<a id='line_1331'>him out of his country. It is pity, said Sir Lamorak, that ever any</a>
<a id='line_1332'>such false knight-coward as King Mark is, should be matched with such a</a>
<a id='line_1333'>fair lady and good as La Beale Isoud is, for all the world of him</a>
<a id='line_1334'>speaketh shame, and of her worship that any queen may have. I have not</a>
<a id='line_1335'>ado in this matter, said King Mark, neither nought will I speak</a>
<a id='line_1336'>thereof. Well said, said Sir Lamorak. Sir, can ye tell me any tidings?</a>
<a id='line_1337'>I can tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that there shall be a great</a>
<a id='line_1338'>tournament in haste beside Camelot, at the Castle of Jagent; and the</a>
<a id='line_1339'>King with the Hundred Knights and the King of Ireland, as I suppose,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>make that tournament.</a>
<a id='line_1341'></a>
<a id='line_1342'>Then there came a knight that was called Sir Dinadan, and saluted them</a>
<a id='line_1343'>both. And when he wist that King Mark was a knight of Cornwall he</a>
<a id='line_1344'>reproved him for the love of King Mark a thousand fold more than did</a>
<a id='line_1345'>Sir Lamorak. Then he proffered to joust with King Mark. And he was full</a>
<a id='line_1346'>loath thereto, but Sir Dinadan edged him so, that he jousted with Sir</a>
<a id='line_1347'>Lamorak. And Sir Lamorak smote King Mark so sore that he bare him on</a>
<a id='line_1348'>his spear end over his horse’s tail. And then King Mark arose again,</a>
<a id='line_1349'>and followed after Sir Lamorak. But Sir Dinadan would not joust with</a>
<a id='line_1350'>Sir Lamorak, but he told King Mark that Sir Lamorak was Sir Kay, the</a>
<a id='line_1351'>Seneschal. That is not so, said King Mark, for he is much bigger than</a>
<a id='line_1352'>Sir Kay; and so he followed and overtook him, and bade him abide. What</a>
<a id='line_1353'>will you do? said Sir Lamorak. Sir, he said, I will fight with a sword,</a>
<a id='line_1354'>for ye have shamed me with a spear; and therewith they dashed together</a>
<a id='line_1355'>with swords, and Sir Lamorak suffered him and forbare him. And King</a>
<a id='line_1356'>Mark was passing hasty, and smote thick strokes. Sir Lamorak saw he</a>
<a id='line_1357'>would not stint, and waxed somewhat wroth, and doubled his strokes, for</a>
<a id='line_1358'>he was one of the noblest knights of the world; and he beat him so on</a>
<a id='line_1359'>the helm that his head hung nigh on the saddle bow. When Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_1360'>saw him fare so, he said: Sir knight, what cheer? meseemeth you have</a>
<a id='line_1361'>nigh your fill of fighting, it were pity to do you any more harm, for</a>
<a id='line_1362'>ye are but a mean knight, therefore I give you leave to go where ye</a>
<a id='line_1363'>list. Gramercy, said King Mark, for ye and I be not matches.</a>
<a id='line_1364'></a>
<a id='line_1365'>Then Sir Dinadan mocked King Mark and said: Ye are not able to match a</a>
<a id='line_1366'>good knight. As for that, said King Mark, at the first time I jousted</a>
<a id='line_1367'>with this knight ye refused him. Think ye that it is a shame to me?</a>
<a id='line_1368'>said Sir Dinadan: nay, sir, it is ever worship to a knight to refuse</a>
<a id='line_1369'>that thing that he may not attain, there fore your worship had been</a>
<a id='line_1370'>much more to have refused him as I did; for I warn you plainly he is</a>
<a id='line_1371'>able to beat such five as ye and I be; for ye knights of Cornwall are</a>
<a id='line_1372'>no men of worship as other knights are. And because ye are no men of</a>
<a id='line_1373'>worship ye hate all men of worship, for never was bred in your country</a>
<a id='line_1374'>such a knight as is Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'></a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>CHAPTER IX. How King Mark, Sir Lamorak, and Sir Dinadan came to a</a>
<a id='line_1380'>castle, and how King Mark was known there.</a>
<a id='line_1381'></a>
<a id='line_1382'></a>
<a id='line_1383'>Then they rode forth all together, King Mark, Sir Lamorak, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1384'>Dinadan, till that they came to a bridge, and at the end thereof stood</a>
<a id='line_1385'>a fair tower. Then saw they a knight on horseback well armed,</a>
<a id='line_1386'>brandishing a spear, crying and proffering himself to joust. Now, said</a>
<a id='line_1387'>Sir Dinadan unto King Mark, yonder are two brethren, that one hight</a>
<a id='line_1388'>Alein, and the other hight Trian, that will joust with any that passeth</a>
<a id='line_1389'>this passage. Now proffer yourself, said Dinadan to King Mark, for ever</a>
<a id='line_1390'>ye be laid to the earth. Then King Mark was ashamed, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_1391'>feutred his spear, and hurtled to Sir Trian, and either brake their</a>
<a id='line_1392'>spears all to pieces, and passed through anon. Then Sir Trian sent King</a>
<a id='line_1393'>Mark another spear to joust more; but in no wise he would not joust no</a>
<a id='line_1394'>more. Then they came to the castle all three knights, and prayed the</a>
<a id='line_1395'>lord of the castle of harbour. Ye are right welcome, said the knights</a>
<a id='line_1396'>of the castle, for the love of the lord of this castle, the which hight</a>
<a id='line_1397'>Sir Tor le Fise Aries. And then they came into a fair court well</a>
<a id='line_1398'>repaired, and they had passing good cheer, till the lieutenant of this</a>
<a id='line_1399'>castle, that hight Berluse, espied King Mark of Cornwall. Then said</a>
<a id='line_1400'>Berluse: Sir knight, I know you better than you ween, for ye are King</a>
<a id='line_1401'>Mark that slew my father afore mine own eyen; and me had ye slain had I</a>
<a id='line_1402'>not escaped into a wood; but wit ye well, for the love of my lord of</a>
<a id='line_1403'>this castle I will neither hurt you nor harm you, nor none of your</a>
<a id='line_1404'>fellowship. But wit ye well, when ye are past this lodging I shall hurt</a>
<a id='line_1405'>you an I may, for ye slew my father traitorly. But first for the love</a>
<a id='line_1406'>of my lord, Sir Tor, and for the love of Sir Lamorak, the honourable</a>
<a id='line_1407'>knight that here is lodged, ye shall have none ill lodging; for it is</a>
<a id='line_1408'>pity that ever ye should be in the company of good knights; for ye are</a>
<a id='line_1409'>the most villainous knight or king that is now known alive, for ye are</a>
<a id='line_1410'>a destroyer of good knights, and all that ye do is but treason.</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'></a>
<a id='line_1413'></a>
<a id='line_1414'></a>
<a id='line_1415'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Berluse met with King Mark, and how Sir Dinadan took</a>
<a id='line_1416'>his part.</a>
<a id='line_1417'></a>
<a id='line_1418'></a>
<a id='line_1419'>Then was King Mark sore ashamed, and said but little again. But when</a>
<a id='line_1420'>Sir Lamorak and Sir Dinadan wist that he was King Mark they were sorry</a>
<a id='line_1421'>of his fellowship. So after supper they went to lodging. So on the morn</a>
<a id='line_1422'>they arose early, and King Mark and Sir Dinadan rode together; and</a>
<a id='line_1423'>three mile from their lodging there met with them three knights, and</a>
<a id='line_1424'>Sir Berluse was one, and that other his two cousins. Sir Berluse saw</a>
<a id='line_1425'>King Mark, and then he cried on high: Traitor, keep thee from me for</a>
<a id='line_1426'>wit thou well that I am Berluse. Sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, I</a>
<a id='line_1427'>counsel you to leave off at this time, for he is riding to King Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_1428'>and because I have promised to conduct him to my lord King Arthur needs</a>
<a id='line_1429'>must I take a part with him; howbeit I love not his condition, and fain</a>
<a id='line_1430'>I would be from him. Well, Dinadan, said Sir Berluse, me repenteth that</a>
<a id='line_1431'>ye will take part with him, but now do your best. And then he hurtled</a>
<a id='line_1432'>to King Mark, and smote him sore upon the shield, that he bare him</a>
<a id='line_1433'>clean out of his saddle to the earth. That saw Sir Dinadan, and he</a>
<a id='line_1434'>feutred his spear, and ran to one of Berluse’s fellows, and smote him</a>
<a id='line_1435'>down off his saddle. Then Dinadan turned his horse, and smote the third</a>
<a id='line_1436'>knight in the same wise to the earth, for Sir Dinadan was a good knight</a>
<a id='line_1437'>on horseback; and there began a great battle, for Berluse and his</a>
<a id='line_1438'>fellows held them together strongly on foot. And so through the great</a>
<a id='line_1439'>force of Sir Dinadan King Mark had Berluse to the earth, and his two</a>
<a id='line_1440'>fellows fled; and had not been Sir Dinadan King Mark would have slain</a>
<a id='line_1441'>him. And so Sir Dinadan rescued him of his life, for King Mark was but</a>
<a id='line_1442'>a murderer. And then they took their horses and departed and left Sir</a>
<a id='line_1443'>Berluse there sore wounded.</a>
<a id='line_1444'></a>
<a id='line_1445'>Then King Mark and Sir Dinadan rode forth a four leagues English, till</a>
<a id='line_1446'>that they came to a bridge where hoved a knight on horseback, armed and</a>
<a id='line_1447'>ready to joust. Lo, said Sir Dinadan unto King Mark, yonder hoveth a</a>
<a id='line_1448'>knight that will joust, for there shall none pass this bridge but he</a>
<a id='line_1449'>must joust with that knight. It is well, said King Mark, for this</a>
<a id='line_1450'>jousts falleth with thee. Sir Dinadan knew the knight well that he was</a>
<a id='line_1451'>a noble knight, and fain he would have jousted, but he had had liefer</a>
<a id='line_1452'>King Mark had jousted with him, but by no mean King Mark would not</a>
<a id='line_1453'>joust. Then Sir Dinadan might not refuse him in no manner. And then</a>
<a id='line_1454'>either dressed their spears and their shields, and smote together, so</a>
<a id='line_1455'>that through fine force Sir Dinadan was smitten to the earth; and</a>
<a id='line_1456'>lightly he rose up and gat his horse, and required that knight to do</a>
<a id='line_1457'>battle with swords. And he answered and said: Fair knight, as at this</a>
<a id='line_1458'>time I may not have ado with you no more, for the custom of this</a>
<a id='line_1459'>passage is such. Then was Sir Dinadan passing wroth that he might not</a>
<a id='line_1460'>be revenged of that knight; and so he departed, and in no wise would</a>
<a id='line_1461'>that knight tell his name. But ever Sir Dinadan thought he should know</a>
<a id='line_1462'>him by his shield that it should be Sir Tor.</a>
<a id='line_1463'></a>
<a id='line_1464'></a>

<a id='line_1466'></a>
<a id='line_1467'>CHAPTER XI. How King Mark mocked Sir Dinadan, and how they met with six</a>
<a id='line_1468'>knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_1469'></a>
<a id='line_1470'></a>
<a id='line_1471'>So as they rode by the way King Mark then began to mock Sir Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_1472'>and said: I weened you knights of the Table Round might not in no wise</a>
<a id='line_1473'>find their matches. Ye say well, said Sir Dinadan; as for you, on my</a>
<a id='line_1474'>life I call you none of the best knights; but sith ye have such a</a>
<a id='line_1475'>despite at me I require you to joust with me to prove my strength. Not</a>
<a id='line_1476'>so, said King Mark, for I will not have ado with you in no manner; but</a>
<a id='line_1477'>I require you of one thing, that when ye come to Arthur’s court</a>
<a id='line_1478'>discover not my name, for I am there so hated. It is shame to you, said</a>
<a id='line_1479'>Sir Dinadan, that ye govern you so shamefully; for I see by you ye are</a>
<a id='line_1480'>full of cowardice, and ye are a murderer, and that is the greatest</a>
<a id='line_1481'>shame that a knight may have; for never a knight being a murderer hath</a>
<a id='line_1482'>worship, nor never shall have; for I saw but late through my force ye</a>
<a id='line_1483'>would have slain Sir Berluse, a better knight than ye, or ever ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1484'>be, and more of prowess. Thus they rode forth talking till they came to</a>
<a id='line_1485'>a fair place, where stood a knight, and prayed them to take their</a>
<a id='line_1486'>lodging with him. So at the request of that knight they reposed them</a>
<a id='line_1487'>there, and made them well at ease, and had great cheer. For all</a>
<a id='line_1488'>errant-knights were welcome to him, and specially all those of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_1489'>court. Then Sir Dinadan demanded his host what was the knight’s name</a>
<a id='line_1490'>that kept the bridge. For what cause ask you it? said the host. For it</a>
<a id='line_1491'>is not long ago, said Sir Dinadan, sithen he gave me a fall. Ah, fair</a>
<a id='line_1492'>knight, said his host, thereof have ye no marvel, for he is a passing</a>
<a id='line_1493'>good knight, and his name is Sir Tor, the son of Aries le Vaysher. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_1494'>said Sir Dinadan, was that Sir Tor? for truly so ever me thought.</a>
<a id='line_1495'></a>
<a id='line_1496'>Right as they stood thus talking together they saw come riding to them</a>
<a id='line_1497'>over a plain six knights of the court of King Arthur, well armed at all</a>
<a id='line_1498'>points. And there by their shields Sir Dinadan knew them well. The</a>
<a id='line_1499'>first was the good knight Sir Uwaine, the son of King Uriens, the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>second was the noble knight Sir Brandiles, the third was Ozana le Cure</a>
<a id='line_1501'>Hardy, the fourth was Uwaine les Aventurous, the fifth was Sir</a>
<a id='line_1502'>Agravaine, the sixth Sir Mordred, brother to Sir Gawaine. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_1503'>Dinadan had seen these six knights he thought in himself he would bring</a>
<a id='line_1504'>King Mark by some wile to joust with one of them. And anon they took</a>
<a id='line_1505'>their horses and ran after these knights well a three mile English.</a>
<a id='line_1506'>Then was King Mark ware where they sat all six about a well, and ate</a>
<a id='line_1507'>and drank such meats as they had, and their horses walking and some</a>
<a id='line_1508'>tied, and their shields hung in divers places about them. Lo, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1509'>Dinadan, yonder are knights-errant that will joust with us. God forbid,</a>
<a id='line_1510'>said King Mark, for they be six and we but two. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1511'>Dinadan, let us not spare, for I will assay the foremost; and therewith</a>
<a id='line_1512'>he made him ready. When King Mark saw him do so, as fast as Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_1513'>rode toward them, King Mark rode froward them with all his menial</a>
<a id='line_1514'>meiny. So when Sir Dinadan saw King Mark was gone, he set the spear out</a>
<a id='line_1515'>of the rest, and threw his shield upon his back, and came, riding to</a>
<a id='line_1516'>the fellowship of the Table Round. And anon Sir Uwaine knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_1517'>Dinadan, and welcomed him, and so did all his fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_1518'></a>

<a id='line_1523'>Mark, and how King Mark refused him.</a>
<a id='line_1524'></a>
<a id='line_1525'></a>
<a id='line_1526'>And then they asked him of his adventures, and whether he had seen Sir</a>
<a id='line_1527'>Tristram or Sir Launcelot. So God me help, said Sir Dinadan, I saw none</a>
<a id='line_1528'>of them sithen I departed from Camelot. What knight is that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1529'>Brandiles, that so suddenly departed from you, and rode over yonder</a>
<a id='line_1530'>field? Sir, said he, it was a knight of Cornwall, and the most horrible</a>
<a id='line_1531'>coward that ever bestrode horse. What is his name? said all these</a>
<a id='line_1532'>knights. I wot not, said Sir Dinadan. So when they had reposed them,</a>
<a id='line_1533'>and spoken together, they took their horses and rode to a castle where</a>
<a id='line_1534'>dwelt an old knight that made all knights-errant good cheer. Then in</a>
<a id='line_1535'>the meanwhile that they were talking came into the castle Sir Griflet</a>
<a id='line_1536'>le Fise de Dieu, and there was he welcome; and they all asked him</a>
<a id='line_1537'>whether he had seen Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram. Sirs, he answered, I</a>
<a id='line_1538'>saw him not sithen he departed from Camelot. So as Sir Dinadan walked</a>
<a id='line_1539'>and beheld the castle, thereby in a chamber he espied King Mark, and</a>
<a id='line_1540'>then he rebuked him, and asked him why he departed so. Sir, said he,</a>
<a id='line_1541'>for I durst not abide because they were so many. But how escaped ye?</a>
<a id='line_1542'>said King Mark. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, they were better friends than I</a>
<a id='line_1543'>weened they had been. Who is captain of that fellowship? said the king.</a>
<a id='line_1544'>Then for to fear him Sir Dinadan said that it was Sir Launcelot. O</a>
<a id='line_1545'>Jesu, said the king, might I know Sir Launcelot by his shield? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>said Dinadan, for he beareth a shield of silver and black bends. All</a>
<a id='line_1547'>this he said to fear the king, for Sir Launcelot was not in his</a>
<a id='line_1548'>fellowship. Now I pray you, said King Mark, that ye will ride in my</a>
<a id='line_1549'>fellowship. That is me loath to do, said Sir Dinadan, because ye</a>
<a id='line_1550'>forsook my fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_1551'></a>
<a id='line_1552'>Right so Sir Dinadan went from King Mark, and went to his own</a>
<a id='line_1553'>fellowship; and so they mounted upon their horses, and rode on their</a>
<a id='line_1554'>ways, and talked of the Cornish knight, for Dinadan told them that he</a>
<a id='line_1555'>was in the castle where they were lodged. It is well said, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1556'>Griflet, for here have I brought Sir Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, that</a>
<a id='line_1557'>is the best fellow and the merriest in the world. Will ye do well? said</a>
<a id='line_1558'>Sir Dinadan: I have told the Cornish knight that here is Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_1559'>and the Cornish knight asked me what shield he bare. Truly, I told him</a>
<a id='line_1560'>that he bare the same shield that Sir Mordred beareth. Will ye do well?</a>
<a id='line_1561'>said Sir Mordred; I am hurt and may not well bear my shield nor</a>
<a id='line_1562'>harness, and therefore put my shield and my harness upon Sir Dagonet,</a>
<a id='line_1563'>and let him set upon the Cornish knight. That shall be done, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1564'>Dagonet, by my faith. Then anon was Dagonet armed him in Mordred’s</a>
<a id='line_1565'>harness and his shield, and he was set on a great horse, and a spear in</a>
<a id='line_1566'>his hand. Now, said Dagonet, shew me the knight, and I trow I shall</a>
<a id='line_1567'>bear him down. So all these knights rode to a woodside, and abode till</a>
<a id='line_1568'>King Mark came by the way. Then they put forth Sir Dagonet, and he came</a>
<a id='line_1569'>on all the while his horse might run, straight upon King Mark. And when</a>
<a id='line_1570'>he came nigh King Mark, he cried as he were wood, and said: Keep thee,</a>
<a id='line_1571'>knight of Cornwall, for I will slay thee. Anon, as King Mark beheld his</a>
<a id='line_1572'>shield, he said to himself: Yonder is Sir Launcelot; alas, now am I</a>
<a id='line_1573'>destroyed; and therewithal he made his horse to run as fast as it might</a>
<a id='line_1574'>through thick and thin. And ever Sir Dagonet followed after King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_1575'>crying and rating him as a wood man, through a great forest. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_1576'>Uwaine and Sir Brandiles saw Dagonet so chase King Mark, they laughed</a>
<a id='line_1577'>all as they were wood. And then they took their horses, and rode after</a>
<a id='line_1578'>to see how Sir Dagonet sped, for they would not for no good that Sir</a>
<a id='line_1579'>Dagonet were shent, for King Arthur loved him passing well, and made</a>
<a id='line_1580'>him knight with his own hands. And at every tournament he began to make</a>
<a id='line_1581'>King Arthur to laugh. Then the knights rode here and there, crying and</a>
<a id='line_1582'>chasing after King Mark, that all the forest rang of the noise.</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'></a>
<a id='line_1585'></a>
<a id='line_1586'></a>
<a id='line_1587'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Palomides by adventure met King Mark flying, and</a>
<a id='line_1588'>how he overthrew Dagonet and other knights.</a>
<a id='line_1589'></a>
<a id='line_1590'></a>
<a id='line_1591'>So King Mark rode by fortune by a well, in the way where stood a</a>
<a id='line_1592'>knight-errant on horseback, armed at all points, with a great spear in</a>
<a id='line_1593'>his hand. And when he saw King Mark coming flying he said: Knight,</a>
<a id='line_1594'>return again for shame and stand with me, and I shall be thy warrant.</a>
<a id='line_1595'>Ah, fair knight, said King Mark, let me pass, for yonder cometh after</a>
<a id='line_1596'>me the best knight of the world, with the black bended shield. Fie, for</a>
<a id='line_1597'>shame, said the knight, he is none of the worthy knights, and if he</a>
<a id='line_1598'>were Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram I should not doubt to meet the</a>
<a id='line_1599'>better of them both. When King Mark heard him say that word, he turned</a>
<a id='line_1600'>his horse and abode by him. And then that strong knight bare a spear to</a>
<a id='line_1601'>Dagonet, and smote him so sore that he bare him over his horse’s tail,</a>
<a id='line_1602'>and nigh he had broken his neck. And anon after him came Sir Brandiles,</a>
<a id='line_1603'>and when he saw Dagonet have that fall he was passing wroth, and cried:</a>
<a id='line_1604'>Keep thee, knight, and so they hurtled together wonder sore. But the</a>
<a id='line_1605'>knight smote Sir Brandiles so sore that he went to the earth, horse and</a>
<a id='line_1606'>man. Sir Uwaine came after and saw all this. Jesu, said he, yonder is a</a>
<a id='line_1607'>strong knight. And then they feutred their spears, and this knight came</a>
<a id='line_1608'>so eagerly that he smote down Sir Uwaine. Then came Ozana with the</a>
<a id='line_1609'>hardy heart, and he was smitten down. Now, said Sir Griflet, by my</a>
<a id='line_1610'>counsel let us send to yonder errant-knight, and wit whether he be of</a>
<a id='line_1611'>Arthur’s court, for as I deem it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. So they sent</a>
<a id='line_1612'>unto him, and prayed the strange knight to tell his name, and whether</a>
<a id='line_1613'>he were of Arthur’s court or not. As for my name they shall not wit,</a>
<a id='line_1614'>but tell them I am a knight-errant as they are, and let them wit that I</a>
<a id='line_1615'>am no knight of King Arthur’s court; and so the squire rode again unto</a>
<a id='line_1616'>them and told them his answer of him. By my head, said Sir Agravaine,</a>
<a id='line_1617'>he is one of the strongest knights that ever I saw, for he hath</a>
<a id='line_1618'>overthrown three noble knights, and needs we must encounter with him</a>
<a id='line_1619'>for shame. So Sir Agravaine feutred his spear, and that other was</a>
<a id='line_1620'>ready, and smote him down over his horse to the earth. And in the same</a>
<a id='line_1621'>wise he smote Sir Uwaine les Avoutres and also Sir Griflet. Then had he</a>
<a id='line_1622'>served them all but Sir Dinadan, for he was behind, and Sir Mordred was</a>
<a id='line_1623'>unarmed, and Dagonet had his harness.</a>
<a id='line_1624'></a>
<a id='line_1625'>So when this was done, this strong knight rode on his way a soft pace,</a>
<a id='line_1626'>and King Mark rode after him, praising him mickle; but he would answer</a>
<a id='line_1627'>no words, but sighed wonderly sore, hanging down his head, taking no</a>
<a id='line_1628'>heed to his words. Thus they rode well a three mile English, and then</a>
<a id='line_1629'>this knight called to him a varlet, and bade him ride until yonder fair</a>
<a id='line_1630'>manor, and recommend me to the lady of that castle and place, and pray</a>
<a id='line_1631'>her to send me refreshing of good meats and drinks. And if she ask thee</a>
<a id='line_1632'>what I am, tell her that I am the knight that followeth the glatisant</a>
<a id='line_1633'>beast: that is in English to say the questing beast; for that beast</a>
<a id='line_1634'>wheresomever he yede he quested in the belly with such a noise as it</a>
<a id='line_1635'>had been a thirty couple of hounds. Then the varlet went his way and</a>
<a id='line_1636'>came to the manor, and saluted the lady, and told her from whence he</a>
<a id='line_1637'>came. And when she understood that he came from the knight that</a>
<a id='line_1638'>followed the questing beast: O sweet Lord Jesu, she said, when shall I</a>
<a id='line_1639'>see that noble knight, my dear son Palomides? Alas, will he not abide</a>
<a id='line_1640'>with me? and therewith she swooned and wept, and made passing great</a>
<a id='line_1641'>dole. And then also soon as she might she gave the varlet all that he</a>
<a id='line_1642'>asked. And the varlet returned unto Sir Palomides, for he was a varlet</a>
<a id='line_1643'>of King Mark. And as soon as he came, he told the knight’s name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_1644'>Palomides. I am well pleased, said King Mark, but hold thee still and</a>
<a id='line_1645'>say nothing. Then they alighted and set them down and reposed them a</a>
<a id='line_1646'>while. Anon withal King Mark fell asleep. When Sir Palomides saw him</a>
<a id='line_1647'>sound asleep he took his horse and rode his way, and said to them: I</a>
<a id='line_1648'>will not be in the company of a sleeping knight. And so he rode forth a</a>
<a id='line_1649'>great pace.</a>
<a id='line_1650'></a>
<a id='line_1651'></a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'></a>
<a id='line_1654'>CHAPTER XIV. How King Mark and Sir Dinadan heard Sir Palomides making</a>
<a id='line_1655'>great sorrow and mourning for La Beale Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_1656'></a>
<a id='line_1657'></a>
<a id='line_1658'>Now turn we unto Sir Dinadan, that found these seven knights passing</a>
<a id='line_1659'>heavy. And when he wist how that they sped, as heavy was he. My lord</a>
<a id='line_1660'>Uwaine, said Dinadan, I dare lay my head it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. I</a>
<a id='line_1661'>promise you all I shall find him an he may be found in this country.</a>
<a id='line_1662'>And so Sir Dinadan rode after this knight; and so did King Mark, that</a>
<a id='line_1663'>sought him through the forest. So as King Mark rode after Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_1664'>he heard the noise of a man that made great dole. Then King Mark rode</a>
<a id='line_1665'>as nigh that noise as he might and as he durst. Then was he ware of a</a>
<a id='line_1666'>knight that was descended off his horse, and had put off his helm, and</a>
<a id='line_1667'>there he made a piteous complaint and a dolorous, of love.</a>
<a id='line_1668'></a>
<a id='line_1669'>Now leave we that, and talk we of Sir Dinadan, that rode to seek Sir</a>
<a id='line_1670'>Palomides. And as he came within a forest he met with a knight, a</a>
<a id='line_1671'>chaser of a deer. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, met ye with a knight with a</a>
<a id='line_1672'>shield of silver and lions’ heads? Yea, fair knight, said the other,</a>
<a id='line_1673'>with such a knight met I with but a while agone, and straight yonder</a>
<a id='line_1674'>way he yede. Gramercy, said Sir Dinadan, for might I find the track of</a>
<a id='line_1675'>his horse I should not fail to find that knight. Right so as Sir</a>
<a id='line_1676'>Dinadan rode in the even late he heard a doleful noise as it were of a</a>
<a id='line_1677'>man. Then Sir Dinadan rode toward that noise; and when he came nigh</a>
<a id='line_1678'>that noise he alighted off his horse, and went near him on foot. Then</a>
<a id='line_1679'>was he ware of a knight that stood under a tree, and his horse tied by</a>
<a id='line_1680'>him, and the helm off his head; and ever that knight made a doleful</a>
<a id='line_1681'>complaint as ever made knight. And always he made his complaint of La</a>
<a id='line_1682'>Beale Isoud, the Queen of Cornwall, and said: Ah, fair lady, why love I</a>
<a id='line_1683'>thee! for thou art fairest of all other, and yet showest thou never</a>
<a id='line_1684'>love to me, nor bounty. Alas, yet must I love thee. And I may not blame</a>
<a id='line_1685'>thee, fair lady, for mine eyes be cause of this sorrow. And yet to love</a>
<a id='line_1686'>thee I am but a fool, for the best knight of the world loveth thee, and</a>
<a id='line_1687'>ye him again, that is Sir Tristram de Liones. And the falsest king and</a>
<a id='line_1688'>knight is your husband, and the most coward and full of treason, is</a>
<a id='line_1689'>your lord, King Mark. Alas, that ever so fair a lady and peerless of</a>
<a id='line_1690'>all other should be matched with the most villainous knight of the</a>
<a id='line_1691'>world. All this language heard King Mark, what Sir Palomides said by</a>
<a id='line_1692'>him; wherefore he was adread when he saw Sir Dinadan, lest he espied</a>
<a id='line_1693'>him, that he would tell Sir Palomides that he was King Mark; and</a>
<a id='line_1694'>therefore he withdrew him, and took his horse and rode to his men,</a>
<a id='line_1695'>where he commanded them to abide. And so he rode as fast as he might</a>
<a id='line_1696'>unto Camelot; and the same day he found there Amant, the knight, ready</a>
<a id='line_1697'>that afore Arthur had appealed him of treason; and so, lightly the king</a>
<a id='line_1698'>commanded them to do battle. And by misadventure King Mark smote Amant</a>
<a id='line_1699'>through the body. And yet was Amant in the righteous quarrel. And right</a>
<a id='line_1700'>so he took his horse and departed from the court for dread of Sir</a>
<a id='line_1701'>Dinadan, that he would tell Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides what he was.</a>
<a id='line_1702'>Then were there maidens that La Beale Isoud had sent to Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_1703'>that knew Sir Amant well.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'></a>
<a id='line_1706'></a>
<a id='line_1707'></a>
<a id='line_1708'>CHAPTER XV. How King Mark had slain Sir Amant wrongfully to-fore King</a>
<a id='line_1709'>Arthur, and Sir Launcelot fetched King Mark to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'></a>
<a id='line_1712'>Then by the license of King Arthur they went to him and spake with him;</a>
<a id='line_1713'>for while the truncheon of the spear stuck in his body he spake: Ah,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>fair damosels, said Amant, recommend me unto La Beale Isoud, and tell</a>
<a id='line_1715'>her that I am slain for the love of her and of Sir Tristram. And there</a>
<a id='line_1716'>he told the damosels how cowardly King Mark had slain him, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1717'>Bersules, his fellow. And for that deed I appealed him of treason, and</a>
<a id='line_1718'>here am I slain in a righteous quarrel; and all was because Sir</a>
<a id='line_1719'>Bersules and I would not consent by treason to slay the noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_1720'>Sir Tristram. Then the two maidens cried aloud that all the court might</a>
<a id='line_1721'>hear it, and said: O sweet Lord Jesu, that knowest all hid things, why</a>
<a id='line_1722'>sufferest Thou so false a traitor to vanquish and slay a true knight</a>
<a id='line_1723'>that fought in a righteous quarrel? Then anon it was sprung to the</a>
<a id='line_1724'>king, and the queen, and to all the lords, that it was King Mark that</a>
<a id='line_1725'>had slain Sir Amant, and Sir Bersules afore hand; wherefore they did</a>
<a id='line_1726'>their battle. Then was King Arthur wroth out of measure, and so were</a>
<a id='line_1727'>all the other knights. But when Sir Tristram knew all the matter he</a>
<a id='line_1728'>made great dole and sorrow out of measure, and wept for sorrow for the</a>
<a id='line_1729'>loss of the noble knights, Sir Bersules and of Sir Amant.</a>
<a id='line_1730'></a>
<a id='line_1731'>When Sir Launcelot espied Sir Tristram weep he went hastily to King</a>
<a id='line_1732'>Arthur, and said: Sir, I pray you give me leave to return again to</a>
<a id='line_1733'>yonder false king and knight. I pray you, said King Arthur, fetch him</a>
<a id='line_1734'>again, but I would not that ye slew him, for my worship. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_1735'>Launcelot armed him in all haste, and mounted upon a great horse, and</a>
<a id='line_1736'>took a spear in his hand and rode after King Mark. And from thence a</a>
<a id='line_1737'>three mile English Sir Launcelot over took him, and bade him: Turn</a>
<a id='line_1738'>recreant king and knight, for whether thou wilt or not thou shalt go</a>
<a id='line_1739'>with me to King Arthur’s court. King Mark returned and looked upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_1740'>Launcelot, and said: Fair sir, what is your name? Wit thou well, said</a>
<a id='line_1741'>he, my name is Sir Launcelot, and therefore defend thee. And when King</a>
<a id='line_1742'>Mark wist that it was Sir Launcelot, and came so fast upon him with a</a>
<a id='line_1743'>spear, he cried then aloud: I yield me to thee, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_1744'>honourable knight. But Sir Launcelot would not hear him, but came fast</a>
<a id='line_1745'>upon him. King Mark saw that, and made no defence, but tumbled adown</a>
<a id='line_1746'>out of his saddle to the earth as a sack, and there he lay still, and</a>
<a id='line_1747'>cried Sir Launcelot mercy. Arise, recreant knight and king. I will not</a>
<a id='line_1748'>fight, said King Mark, but whither that ye will I will go with you.</a>
<a id='line_1749'>Alas, alas, said Sir Launcelot, that I may not give thee one buffet for</a>
<a id='line_1750'>the love of Sir Tristram and of La Beale Isoud, and for the two knights</a>
<a id='line_1751'>that thou hast slain traitorly. And so he mounted upon his horse and</a>
<a id='line_1752'>brought him to King Arthur; and there King Mark alighted in that same</a>
<a id='line_1753'>place, and threw his helm from him upon the earth, and his sword, and</a>
<a id='line_1754'>fell flat to the earth of King Arthur’s feet, and put him in his grace</a>
<a id='line_1755'>and mercy. So God me help, said Arthur, ye are welcome in a manner, and</a>
<a id='line_1756'>in a manner ye are not welcome. In this manner ye are welcome, that ye</a>
<a id='line_1757'>come hither maugre thy head, as I suppose. That is truth, said King</a>
<a id='line_1758'>Mark, and else I had not been here, for my lord, Sir Launcelot, brought</a>
<a id='line_1759'>me hither through his fine force, and to him am I yolden to as</a>
<a id='line_1760'>recreant. Well, said Arthur, ye understand ye ought to do me service,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>homage, and fealty. And never would ye do me none, but ever ye have</a>
<a id='line_1762'>been against me, and a destroyer of my knights; now, how will ye acquit</a>
<a id='line_1763'>you? Sir, said King Mark, right as your lordship will require me, unto</a>
<a id='line_1764'>my power, I will make a large amends. For he was a fair speaker, and</a>
<a id='line_1765'>false thereunder. Then for great pleasure of Sir Tristram, to make them</a>
<a id='line_1766'>twain accorded, the king withheld King Mark as at that time, and made a</a>
<a id='line_1767'>broken love-day between them.</a>

<a id='line_1772'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Dinadan told Sir Palomides of the battle between</a>
<a id='line_1773'>Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristam.</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'></a>
<a id='line_1776'>Now turn we again unto Sir Palomides, how Sir Dinadan comforted him in</a>
<a id='line_1777'>all that he might, from his great sorrow. What knight are ye? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1778'>Palomides. Sir, I am a knight-errant as ye be, that hath sought you</a>
<a id='line_1779'>long by your shield. Here is my shield, said Sir Palomides, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_1780'>well, an ye will ought, therewith I will defend it. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_1781'>Dinadan, I will not have ado with you but in good manner. And if ye</a>
<a id='line_1782'>will, ye shall find me soon ready. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, whitherward</a>
<a id='line_1783'>ride you this way? By my head, said Sir Palomides, I wot not, but as</a>
<a id='line_1784'>fortune leadeth me. Heard ye or saw ye ought of Sir Tristram? So God me</a>
<a id='line_1785'>help, of Sir Tristram I both heard and saw, and not for then we loved</a>
<a id='line_1786'>not inwardly well together, yet at my mischief Sir Tristram rescued me</a>
<a id='line_1787'>from my death; and yet, or he and I departed, by both our assents we</a>
<a id='line_1788'>assigned a day that we should have met at the stony grave that Merlin</a>
<a id='line_1789'>set beside Camelot, and there to have done battle together; howbeit I</a>
<a id='line_1790'>was letted, said Sir Palomides, that I might not hold my day, the which</a>
<a id='line_1791'>grieveth me sore; but I have a large excuse. For I was prisoner with a</a>
<a id='line_1792'>lord, and many other more, and that shall Sir Tristram right well</a>
<a id='line_1793'>understand, that I brake it not of fear of cowardice. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_1794'>Palomides told Sir Dinadan the same day that they should have met. So</a>
<a id='line_1795'>God me help, said Sir Dinadan, that same day met Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_1796'>Tristram at the same grave of stone. And there was the most mightiest</a>
<a id='line_1797'>battle that ever was seen in this land betwixt two knights, for they</a>
<a id='line_1798'>fought more than two hours. And there they both bled so much blood that</a>
<a id='line_1799'>all men marvelled that ever they might endure it. And so at the last,</a>
<a id='line_1800'>by both their assents, they were made friends and sworn-brethren for</a>
<a id='line_1801'>ever, and no man can judge the better knight. And now is Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1802'>made a knight of the Round Table, and he sitteth in the siege of the</a>
<a id='line_1803'>noble knight, Sir Marhaus. By my head, said Sir Palomides, Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_1804'>is far bigger than Sir Launcelot, and the hardier knight. Have ye</a>
<a id='line_1805'>assayed them both? said Sir Dinadan. I have seen Sir Tristram fight,</a>
<a id='line_1806'>said Sir Palomides, but never Sir Launcelot to my witting. But at the</a>
<a id='line_1807'>fountain where Sir Launcelot lay asleep, there with one spear he smote</a>
<a id='line_1808'>down Sir Tristram and me, said Palomides, but at that time they knew</a>
<a id='line_1809'>not either other. Fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, as for Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_1810'>and Sir Tristram let them be, for the worst of them will not be lightly</a>
<a id='line_1811'>matched of no knights that I know living. No, said Sir Palomides, God</a>
<a id='line_1812'>defend, but an I had a quarrel to the better of them both I would with</a>
<a id='line_1813'>as good a will fight with him as with you. Sir, I require you tell me</a>
<a id='line_1814'>your name, and in good faith I shall hold you company till that we come</a>
<a id='line_1815'>to Camelot; and there shall ye have great worship now at this great</a>
<a id='line_1816'>tournament; for there shall be the Queen Guenever, and La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_1817'>of Cornwall. Wit you well, sir knight, for the love of La Beale Isoud I</a>
<a id='line_1818'>will be there, and else not, but I will not have ado in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_1819'>court. Sir, said Dinadan, I shall ride with you and do you service, so</a>
<a id='line_1820'>you will tell me your name. Sir, ye shall understand my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_1821'>Palomides, brother to Safere, the good and noble knight. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_1822'>Segwarides and I, we be Saracens born, of father and mother. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_1823'>Sir Dinadan, I thank you much for the telling of your name. For I am</a>
<a id='line_1824'>glad of that I know your name, and I promise you by the faith of my</a>
<a id='line_1825'>body, ye shall not be hurt by me by my will, but rather be advanced.</a>
<a id='line_1826'>And thereto will I help you with all my power, I promise you, doubt ye</a>
<a id='line_1827'>not. And certainly on my life ye shall win great worship in the court</a>
<a id='line_1828'>of King Arthur, and be right welcome. So then they dressed on their</a>
<a id='line_1829'>helms and put on their shields, and mounted upon their horses, and took</a>
<a id='line_1830'>the broad way towards Camelot. And then were they ware of a castle that</a>
<a id='line_1831'>was fair and rich, and also passing strong as any was within this</a>
<a id='line_1832'>realm.</a>
<a id='line_1833'></a>

<a id='line_1837'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with divers knights of the castle</a>
<a id='line_1838'>wherein was Morgan le Fay.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'></a>
<a id='line_1841'>Sir Palomides, said Dinadan, here is a castle that I know well, and</a>
<a id='line_1842'>therein dwelleth Queen Morgan le Fay, King Arthur’s sister; and King</a>
<a id='line_1843'>Arthur gave her this castle, the which he hath repented him sithen a</a>
<a id='line_1844'>thousand times, for sithen King Arthur and she have been at debate and</a>
<a id='line_1845'>strife; but this castle could he never get nor win of her by no manner</a>
<a id='line_1846'>of engine; and ever as she might she made war on King Arthur. And all</a>
<a id='line_1847'>dangerous knights she withholdeth with her, for to destroy all these</a>
<a id='line_1848'>knights that King Arthur loveth. And there shall no knight pass this</a>
<a id='line_1849'>way but he must joust with one knight, or with two, or with three. And</a>
<a id='line_1850'>if it hap that King Arthur’s knight be beaten, he shall lose his horse</a>
<a id='line_1851'>and his harness and all that he hath, and hard, if that he escape, but</a>
<a id='line_1852'>that he shall be prisoner. So God me help, said Palomides, this is a</a>
<a id='line_1853'>shameful custom, and a villainous usance for a queen to use, and namely</a>
<a id='line_1854'>to make such war upon her own lord, that is called the Flower of</a>
<a id='line_1855'>Chivalry that is christian or heathen; and with all my heart I would</a>
<a id='line_1856'>destroy that shameful custom. And I will that all the world wit she</a>
<a id='line_1857'>shall have no service of me. And if she send out any knights, as I</a>
<a id='line_1858'>suppose she will, for to joust, they shall have both their hands full.</a>
<a id='line_1859'>And I shall not fail you, said Sir Dinadan, unto my puissance, upon my</a>
<a id='line_1860'>life.</a>
<a id='line_1861'></a>
<a id='line_1862'>So as they stood on horseback afore the castle, there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_1863'>with a red shield, and two squires after him; and he came straight unto</a>
<a id='line_1864'>Sir Palomides, the good knight, and said to him: Fair and gentle</a>
<a id='line_1865'>knight-errant, I require thee for the love thou owest unto knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>that ye will not have ado here with these men of this castle; for this</a>
<a id='line_1867'>was Sir Lamorak that thus said. For I came hither to seek this deed,</a>
<a id='line_1868'>and it is my request; and therefore I beseech you, knight, let me deal,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>and if I be beaten revenge me. In the name of God, said Palomides, let</a>
<a id='line_1870'>see how ye will speed, and we shall behold you. Then anon came forth a</a>
<a id='line_1871'>knight of the castle, and proffered to joust with the Knight with the</a>
<a id='line_1872'>Red Shield. Anon they encountered together, and he with the red shield</a>
<a id='line_1873'>smote him so hard that he bare him over to the earth. Therewith anon</a>
<a id='line_1874'>came another knight of the castle, and he was smitten so sore that he</a>
<a id='line_1875'>avoided his saddle. And forthwithal came the third knight, and the</a>
<a id='line_1876'>Knight with the Red Shield smote him to the earth. Then came Sir</a>
<a id='line_1877'>Palomides, and besought him that he might help him to joust. Fair</a>
<a id='line_1878'>knight, said he unto him, suffer me as at this time to have my will,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>for an they were twenty knights I shall not doubt them. And ever there</a>
<a id='line_1880'>were upon the walls of the castle many lords and ladies that cried and</a>
<a id='line_1881'>said: Well have ye jousted, Knight with the Red Shield. But as soon as</a>
<a id='line_1882'>the knight had smitten them down, his squire took their horses, and</a>
<a id='line_1883'>avoided their saddles and bridles of the horses, and turned them into</a>
<a id='line_1884'>the forest, and made the knights to be kept to the end of the jousts.</a>
<a id='line_1885'>Right so came out of the castle the fourth knight, and freshly</a>
<a id='line_1886'>proffered to joust with the Knight with the Red Shield: and he was</a>
<a id='line_1887'>ready, and he smote him so hard that horse and man fell to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_1888'>and the knight’s back brake with the fall, and his neck also. O Jesu,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>said Sir Palomides, that yonder is a passing good knight, and the best</a>
<a id='line_1890'>jouster that ever I saw. By my head, said Sir Dinadan, he is as good as</a>
<a id='line_1891'>ever was Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, what knight somever he be.</a>
<a id='line_1892'></a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>

<a id='line_1895'></a>
<a id='line_1896'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Palomides would have jousted for Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_1897'>with the knights of the castle.</a>
<a id='line_1898'></a>
<a id='line_1899'></a>
<a id='line_1900'>Then forthwithal came a knight out of the castle, with a shield bended</a>
<a id='line_1901'>with black and with white. And anon the Knight with the Red Shield and</a>
<a id='line_1902'>he encountered so hard that he smote the knight of the castle through</a>
<a id='line_1903'>the bended shield and through the body, and brake the horse’s back.</a>
<a id='line_1904'>Fair knight, said Sir Palomides, ye have overmuch on hand, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_1905'>pray you let me joust, for ye had need to be reposed. Why sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_1906'>knight, seem ye that I am weak and feeble? and sir, methinketh ye</a>
<a id='line_1907'>proffer me wrong, and to me shame, when I do well enough. I tell you</a>
<a id='line_1908'>now as I told you erst; for an they were twenty knights I shall beat</a>
<a id='line_1909'>them, and if I be beaten or slain then may ye revenge me. And if ye</a>
<a id='line_1910'>think that I be weary, and ye have an appetite to joust with me, I</a>
<a id='line_1911'>shall find you jousting enough. Sir, said Palomides, I said it not</a>
<a id='line_1912'>because I would joust with you, but meseemeth that ye have overmuch on</a>
<a id='line_1913'>hand. And therefore, an ye were gentle, said the Knight with the Red</a>
<a id='line_1914'>Shield, ye should not proffer me shame; therefore I require you to</a>
<a id='line_1915'>joust with me, and ye shall find that I am not weary. Sith ye require</a>
<a id='line_1916'>me, said Sir Palomides, take keep to yourself. Then they two knights</a>
<a id='line_1917'>came together as fast as their horses might run, and the knight smote</a>
<a id='line_1918'>Sir Palomides sore on the shield that the spear went into his side a</a>
<a id='line_1919'>great wound, and a perilous. And therewithal Sir Palomides avoided his</a>
<a id='line_1920'>saddle. And that knight turned unto Sir Dinadan; and when he saw him</a>
<a id='line_1921'>coming he cried aloud, and said: Sir, I will not have ado with you; but</a>
<a id='line_1922'>for that he let it not, but came straight upon him. So Sir Dinadan for</a>
<a id='line_1923'>shame put forth his spear and all to-shivered it upon the knight. But</a>
<a id='line_1924'>he smote Sir Dinadan again so hard that he smote him clean from his</a>
<a id='line_1925'>saddle; but their horses he would not suffer his squires to meddle</a>
<a id='line_1926'>with, and because they were knights-errant.</a>
<a id='line_1927'></a>
<a id='line_1928'>Then he dressed him again to the castle, and jousted with seven knights</a>
<a id='line_1929'>more, and there was none of them might withstand him, but he bare him</a>
<a id='line_1930'>to the earth. And of these twelve knights he slew in plain jousts four.</a>
<a id='line_1931'>And the eight knights he made them to swear on the cross of a sword</a>
<a id='line_1932'>that they should never use the evil customs of the castle. And when he</a>
<a id='line_1933'>had made them to swear that oath he let them pass. And ever stood the</a>
<a id='line_1934'>lords and the ladies on the castle walls crying and saying: Knight with</a>
<a id='line_1935'>the Red Shield, ye have marvellously well done as ever we saw knight</a>
<a id='line_1936'>do. And therewith came a knight out of the castle unarmed, and said:</a>
<a id='line_1937'>Knight with the Red Shield, overmuch damage hast thou done to us this</a>
<a id='line_1938'>day, therefore return whither thou wilt, for here are no more will have</a>
<a id='line_1939'>ado with thee; for we repent sore that ever thou camest here, for by</a>
<a id='line_1940'>thee is fordone the old custom of this castle. And with that word he</a>
<a id='line_1941'>turned again into the castle, and shut the gates. Then the Knight with</a>
<a id='line_1942'>the Red Shield turned and called his squires, and so passed forth on</a>
<a id='line_1943'>his way, and rode a great pace.</a>
<a id='line_1944'></a>
<a id='line_1945'>And when he was past Sir Palomides went to Sir Dinadan, and said: I had</a>
<a id='line_1946'>never such a shame of one knight that ever I met; and therefore I cast</a>
<a id='line_1947'>me to ride after him, and to be revenged with my sword, for a-horseback</a>
<a id='line_1948'>I deem I shall get no worship of him. Sir Palomides, said Dinadan, ye</a>
<a id='line_1949'>shall not meddle with him by my counsel, for ye shall get no worship of</a>
<a id='line_1950'>him; and for this cause, ye have seen him this day have had overmuch to</a>
<a id='line_1951'>do, and overmuch travailed. By almighty Jesu, said Palomides, I shall</a>
<a id='line_1952'>never be at ease till that I have had ado with him. Sir, said Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_1953'>I shall give you my beholding. Well, said Palomides, then shall ye see</a>
<a id='line_1954'>how we shall redress our mights. So they took their horses of their</a>
<a id='line_1955'>varlets, and rode after the Knight with the Red Shield; and down in a</a>
<a id='line_1956'>valley beside a fountain they were ware where he was alighted to repose</a>
<a id='line_1957'>him, and had done off his helm for to drink at the well.</a>
<a id='line_1958'></a>

<a id='line_1962'>CHAPTER XIX. How Sir Lamorak jousted with Sir Palomides, and hurt him</a>
<a id='line_1963'>grievously.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'></a>
<a id='line_1966'>Then Palomides rode fast till he came nigh him. And then he said:</a>
<a id='line_1967'>Knight, remember ye of the shame ye did to me right now at the castle,</a>
<a id='line_1968'>therefore dress thee, for I will have ado with thee. Fair knight, said</a>
<a id='line_1969'>he to Palomides, of me ye win no worship, for ye have seen this day</a>
<a id='line_1970'>that I have been travailed sore. As for that, said Palomides, I will</a>
<a id='line_1971'>not let, for wit ye well I will be revenged. Well, said the knight, I</a>
<a id='line_1972'>may happen to endure you. And therewithal he mounted upon his horse,</a>
<a id='line_1973'>and took a great spear in his hand ready for to joust. Nay, said</a>
<a id='line_1974'>Palomides, I will not joust, for I am sure at jousting I get no prize.</a>
<a id='line_1975'>Fair knight, said that knight, it would beseem a knight to joust and to</a>
<a id='line_1976'>fight on horseback. Ye shall see what I will do, said Palomides. And</a>
<a id='line_1977'>therewith he alighted down upon foot, and dressed his shield afore him</a>
<a id='line_1978'>and pulled out his sword. Then the Knight with the Red Shield descended</a>
<a id='line_1979'>down from his horse, and dressed his shield afore him, and so he drew</a>
<a id='line_1980'>out his sword. And then they came together a soft pace, and wonderly</a>
<a id='line_1981'>they lashed together passing thick the mountenance of an hour or ever</a>
<a id='line_1982'>they breathed. Then they traced and traversed, and waxed wonderly</a>
<a id='line_1983'>wroth, and either behight other death; they hewed so fast with their</a>
<a id='line_1984'>swords that they cut in down half their swords and mails, that the bare</a>
<a id='line_1985'>flesh in some place stood above their harness. And when Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_1986'>beheld his fellow’s sword over-hylled with his blood it grieved him</a>
<a id='line_1987'>sore: some while they foined, some while they struck as wild men. But</a>
<a id='line_1988'>at the last Sir Palomides waxed faint, because of his first wound that</a>
<a id='line_1989'>he had at the castle with a spear, for that wound grieved him wonderly</a>
<a id='line_1990'>sore. Fair knight, said Palomides, meseemeth we have assayed either</a>
<a id='line_1991'>other passing sore, and if it may please thee, I require thee of thy</a>
<a id='line_1992'>knighthood tell me thy name. Sir, said the knight to Palomides, that is</a>
<a id='line_1993'>me loath to do, for thou hast done me wrong and no knighthood to</a>
<a id='line_1994'>proffer me battle, considering my great travail, but an thou wilt tell</a>
<a id='line_1995'>me thy name I will tell thee mine. Sir, said he, wit thou well my name</a>
<a id='line_1996'>is Palomides. Ah, sir, ye shall understand my name is Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_1997'>Galis, son and heir unto the good knight and king, King Pellinore, and</a>
<a id='line_1998'>Sir Tor, the good knight, is my half brother. When Sir Palomides heard</a>
<a id='line_1999'>him say so he kneeled down and asked mercy, For outrageously have I</a>
<a id='line_2000'>done to you this day; considering the great deeds of arms I have seen</a>
<a id='line_2001'>you do, shamefully and unknightly I have required you to do battle. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_2002'>Sir Palomides, said Sir Lamorak, overmuch have ye done and said to me.</a>
<a id='line_2003'>And therewith he embraced him with his both hands, and said: Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_2004'>the worthy knight, in all this land is no better than ye, nor more of</a>
<a id='line_2005'>prowess, and me repenteth sore that we should fight together. So it</a>
<a id='line_2006'>doth not me, said Sir Palomides, and yet am I sorer wounded than ye be;</a>
<a id='line_2007'>but as for that I shall soon thereof be whole. But certainly I would</a>
<a id='line_2008'>not for the fairest castle in this land, but if thou and I had met, for</a>
<a id='line_2009'>I shall love you the days of my life afore all other knights except my</a>
<a id='line_2010'>brother, Sir Safere. I say the same, said Sir Lamorak, except my</a>
<a id='line_2011'>brother, Sir Tor. Then came Sir Dinadan, and he made great joy of Sir</a>
<a id='line_2012'>Lamorak. Then their squires dressed both their shields and their</a>
<a id='line_2013'>harness, and stopped their wounds. And thereby at a priory they rested</a>
<a id='line_2014'>them all night.</a>

<a id='line_2021'></a>
<a id='line_2022'></a>
<a id='line_2023'>Now turn we again. When Sir Ganis and Sir Brandiles with his fellows</a>
<a id='line_2024'>came to the court of King Arthur they told the king, Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_2025'>Sir Tristram, how Sir Dagonet, the fool, chased King Mark through the</a>
<a id='line_2026'>forest, and how the strong knight smote them down all seven with one</a>
<a id='line_2027'>spear. There was great laughing and japing at King Mark and at Sir</a>
<a id='line_2028'>Dagonet. But all these knights could not tell what knight it was that</a>
<a id='line_2029'>rescued King Mark. Then they asked King Mark if that he knew him, and</a>
<a id='line_2030'>he answered and said: He named himself the Knight that followed the</a>
<a id='line_2031'>Questing Beast, and on that name he sent one of my varlets to a place</a>
<a id='line_2032'>where was his mother; and when she heard from whence he came she made</a>
<a id='line_2033'>passing great dole, and discovered to my varlet his name, and said: Oh,</a>
<a id='line_2034'>my dear son, Sir Palomides, why wilt thou not see me? And therefore,</a>
<a id='line_2035'>sir, said King Mark, it is to understand his name is Sir Palomides, a</a>
<a id='line_2036'>noble knight. Then were all these seven knights glad that they knew his</a>
<a id='line_2037'>name.</a>
<a id='line_2038'></a>
<a id='line_2039'>Now turn we again, for on the morn they took their horses, both Sir</a>
<a id='line_2040'>Lamorak, Palomides, and Dinadan, with their squires and varlets, till</a>
<a id='line_2041'>they saw a fair castle that stood on a mountain well closed, and</a>
<a id='line_2042'>thither they rode, and there they found a knight that hight Galahalt,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>that was lord of that castle, and there they had great cheer and were</a>
<a id='line_2044'>well eased. Sir Dinadan, said Sir Lamorak, what will ye do? Oh sir,</a>
<a id='line_2045'>said Dinadan, I will to-morrow to the court of King Arthur. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>said Sir Palomides, I will not ride these three days, for I am sore</a>
<a id='line_2047'>hurt, and much have I bled, and therefore I will repose me here. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_2048'>said Sir Lamorak, and I will abide here with you; and when ye ride,</a>
<a id='line_2049'>then will I ride, unless that ye tarry over long; then will I take my</a>
<a id='line_2050'>horse. Therefore I pray you, Sir Dinadan, abide and ride with us.</a>
<a id='line_2051'>Faithfully, said Dinadan, I will not abide, for I have such a talent to</a>
<a id='line_2052'>see Sir Tristram that I may not abide long from him. Ah, Dinadan, said</a>
<a id='line_2053'>Sir Palomides, now do I understand that ye love my mortal enemy, and</a>
<a id='line_2054'>therefore how should I trust you. Well, said Dinadan, I love my lord</a>
<a id='line_2055'>Sir Tristram, above all other, and him will I serve and do honour. So</a>
<a id='line_2056'>shall I, said Sir Lamorak, in all that may lie in my power.</a>
<a id='line_2057'></a>
<a id='line_2058'>So on the morn Sir Dinadan rode unto the court of King Arthur; and by</a>
<a id='line_2059'>the way as he rode he saw where stood an errant knight, and made him</a>
<a id='line_2060'>ready for to joust. Not so, said Dinadan, for I have no will to joust.</a>
<a id='line_2061'>With me shall ye joust, said the knight, or that ye pass this way.</a>
<a id='line_2062'>Whether ask ye jousts, by love or by hate? The knight answered: Wit ye</a>
<a id='line_2063'>well I ask it for love, and not for hate. It may well be so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_2064'>Dinadan, but ye proffer me hard love when ye will joust with me with a</a>
<a id='line_2065'>sharp spear. But, fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, sith ye will joust</a>
<a id='line_2066'>with me, meet with me in the court of King Arthur, and there shall I</a>
<a id='line_2067'>joust with you. Well, said the knight, sith ye will not joust with me,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>I pray you tell me your name. Sir knight, said he, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_2069'>Dinadan. Ah, said the knight, full well know I you for a good knight</a>
<a id='line_2070'>and a gentle, and wit you well I love you heartily. Then shall there be</a>
<a id='line_2071'>no jousts, said Dinadan, betwixt us. So they departed. And the same day</a>
<a id='line_2072'>he came to Camelot, where lay King Arthur. And there he saluted the</a>
<a id='line_2073'>king and the queen, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram; and all the court</a>
<a id='line_2074'>was glad of Sir Dinadan, for he was gentle, wise, and courteous, and a</a>
<a id='line_2075'>good knight. And in especial, the valiant knight Sir Tristram loved Sir</a>
<a id='line_2076'>Dinadan passing well above all other knights save Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_2077'></a>
<a id='line_2078'>Then the king asked Sir Dinadan what adventures he had seen. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_2079'>Dinadan, I have seen many adventures, and of some King Mark knoweth,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>but not all. Then the king hearkened Sir Dinadan, how he told that Sir</a>
<a id='line_2081'>Palomides and he were afore the castle of Morgan le Fay, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_2082'>Lamorak took the jousts afore them, and how he forjousted twelve</a>
<a id='line_2083'>knights, and of them four he slew, and how after he smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_2084'>Palomides and me both. t I may not believe that, said the king, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_2085'>Palomides is a passing good knight. That is very truth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_2086'>Dinadan, but yet I saw him better proved, hand for hand. And then he</a>
<a id='line_2087'>told the king all that battle, and how Sir Palomides was more weaker,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>and more hurt, and more lost of his blood. And without doubt, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_2089'>Dinadan, had the battle longer lasted, Palomides had been slain. O</a>
<a id='line_2090'>Jesu, said King Arthur, this is to me a great marvel. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_2091'>Tristram, marvel ye nothing thereof, for at mine advice there is not a</a>
<a id='line_2092'>valianter knight in the world living, for I know his might. And now I</a>
<a id='line_2093'>will say you, I was never so weary of knight but if it were Sir</a>
<a id='line_2094'>Launcelot. And there is no knight in the world except Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_2095'>that did so well as Sir Lamorak. So God me help, said the king, I would</a>
<a id='line_2096'>that knight, Sir Lamorak, came to this Court. Sir, said Dinadan, he</a>
<a id='line_2097'>will be here in short space, and Sir Palomides both, but I fear that</a>
<a id='line_2098'>Palomides may not yet travel.</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>

<a id='line_2102'></a>
<a id='line_2103'>CHAPTER XXI. How King Arthur let do cry a jousts, and how Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_2104'>came in, and overthrew Sir Gawaine and many other.</a>
<a id='line_2105'></a>
<a id='line_2106'></a>
<a id='line_2107'>Then within three days after the king let make a jousting at a priory.</a>
<a id='line_2108'>And there made them ready many knights of the Round Table, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_2109'>Gawaine and his brethren made them ready to joust; but Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_2110'>Launcelot, nor Dinadan, would not joust, but suffered Sir Gawaine, for</a>
<a id='line_2111'>the love of King Arthur, with his brethren, to win the gree if they</a>
<a id='line_2112'>might. Then on the morn they apparelled them to joust, Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_2113'>his four brethren, and did there great deeds of arms. And Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_2114'>Maris did marvellously well, but Sir Gawaine passed all that</a>
<a id='line_2115'>fellowship; wherefore King Arthur and all the knights gave Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_2116'>the honour at the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_2117'></a>
<a id='line_2118'>Right so King Arthur was ware of a knight and two squires, the which</a>
<a id='line_2119'>came out of a forest side, with a shield covered with leather, and then</a>
<a id='line_2120'>he came slyly and hurtled here and there, and anon with one spear he</a>
<a id='line_2121'>had smitten down two knights of the Round Table. Then with his hurtling</a>
<a id='line_2122'>he lost the covering of his shield, then was the king and all other</a>
<a id='line_2123'>ware that he bare a red shield. O Jesu, said King Arthur, see where</a>
<a id='line_2124'>rideth a stout knight, he with the red shield. And there was noise and</a>
<a id='line_2125'>crying: Beware the Knight with the Red Shield. So within a little while</a>
<a id='line_2126'>he had overthrown three brethren of Sir Gawaine’s. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_2127'>King Arthur, meseemeth yonder is the best jouster that ever I saw. With</a>
<a id='line_2128'>that he saw him encounter with Sir Gawaine, and he smote him down with</a>
<a id='line_2129'>so great force that he made his horse to avoid his saddle. How now,</a>
<a id='line_2130'>said the king, Sir Gawaine hath a fall; well were me an I knew what</a>
<a id='line_2131'>knight he were with the red shield. I know him well, said Dinadan, but</a>
<a id='line_2132'>as at this time ye shall not know his name. By my head, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_2133'>Tristram, he jousted better than Sir Palomides, and if ye list to know</a>
<a id='line_2134'>his name, wit ye well his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis.</a>
<a id='line_2135'></a>
<a id='line_2136'>As they stood thus talking, Sir Gawaine and he encountered together</a>
<a id='line_2137'>again, and there he smote Sir Gawaine from his horse, and bruised him</a>
<a id='line_2138'>sore. And in the sight of King Arthur he smote down twenty knights,</a>
<a id='line_2139'>beside Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And so clearly was the prize given</a>
<a id='line_2140'>him as a knight peerless. Then slyly and marvellously Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_2141'>withdrew him from all the fellowship into the forest side. All this</a>
<a id='line_2142'>espied King Arthur, for his eye went never from him. Then the king, Sir</a>
<a id='line_2143'>Launcelot, Sir Tristram, and Sir Dinadan, took their hackneys, and rode</a>
<a id='line_2144'>straight after the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and there found</a>
<a id='line_2145'>him. And thus said the king: Ah, fair knight, well be ye found. When he</a>
<a id='line_2146'>saw the king he put off his helm and saluted him, and when he saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_2147'>Tristram he alighted down off his horse and ran to him to take him by</a>
<a id='line_2148'>the thighs, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him, but he alighted or</a>
<a id='line_2149'>that he came, and either took other in arms, and made great joy of</a>
<a id='line_2150'>other. The king was glad, and also was all the fellowship of the Round</a>
<a id='line_2151'>Table, except Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And when they wist that he</a>
<a id='line_2152'>was Sir Lamorak, they had great despite at him, and were wonderly wroth</a>
<a id='line_2153'>with him that he had put him to dishonour that day.</a>
<a id='line_2154'></a>
<a id='line_2155'>Then Gawaine called privily in council all his brethren, and to them</a>
<a id='line_2156'>said thus: Fair brethren, here may ye see, whom that we hate King</a>
<a id='line_2157'>Arthur loveth, and whom that we love he hateth. And wit ye well, my</a>
<a id='line_2158'>fair brethren, that this Sir Lamorak will never love us, because we</a>
<a id='line_2159'>slew his father, King Pellinore, for we deemed that he slew our father,</a>
<a id='line_2160'>King of Orkney. And for the despite of Pellinore, Sir Lamorak did us a</a>
<a id='line_2161'>shame to our mother, therefore I will be revenged. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_2162'>Gawaine’s brethren, let see how ye will or may be revenged, and ye</a>
<a id='line_2163'>shall find us ready. Well, said Gawaine, hold you still and we shall</a>
<a id='line_2164'>espy our time.</a>

<a id='line_2171'></a>
<a id='line_2172'></a>
<a id='line_2173'>Now pass we our matter, and leave we Sir Gawaine, and speak of King</a>
<a id='line_2174'>Arthur, that on a day said unto King Mark: Sir, I pray you give me a</a>
<a id='line_2175'>gift that I shall ask you. Sir, said King Mark, I will give you</a>
<a id='line_2176'>whatsomever ye desire an it be in my power. Sir, gramercy, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2177'>This I will ask you, that ye will be good lord unto Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_2178'>he is a man of great honour; and that ye will take him with you into</a>
<a id='line_2179'>Cornwall, and let him see his friends, and there cherish him for my</a>
<a id='line_2180'>sake. Sir, said King Mark, I promise you by the faith of my body, and</a>
<a id='line_2181'>by the faith that I owe to God and to you, I shall worship him for your</a>
<a id='line_2182'>sake in all that I can or may. Sir, said Arthur, and I will forgive you</a>
<a id='line_2183'>all the evil will that ever I ought you, an so be that you swear that</a>
<a id='line_2184'>upon a book before me. With a good will, said King Mark; and so he</a>
<a id='line_2185'>there sware upon a book afore him and all his knights, and therewith</a>
<a id='line_2186'>King Mark and Sir Tristram took either other by the hands hard knit</a>
<a id='line_2187'>together. But for all this King Mark thought falsely, as it proved</a>
<a id='line_2188'>after, for he put Sir Tristram in prison, and cowardly would have slain</a>
<a id='line_2189'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2190'></a>
<a id='line_2191'>Then soon after King Mark took his leave to ride into Cornwall, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_2192'>Tristram made him ready to ride with him, whereof the most part of the</a>
<a id='line_2193'>Round Table were wroth and heavy, and in especial Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_2194'>Sir Lamorak, and Sir Dinadan, were wroth out of measure. For well they</a>
<a id='line_2195'>wist King Mark would slay or destroy Sir Tristram. Alas, said Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_2196'>that my lord, Sir Tristram, shall depart. And Sir Tristram took such</a>
<a id='line_2197'>sorrow that he was amazed like a fool. Alas, said Sir Launcelot unto</a>
<a id='line_2198'>King Arthur, what have ye done, for ye shall lose the most man of</a>
<a id='line_2199'>worship that ever came into your court. It was his own desire, said</a>
<a id='line_2200'>Arthur, and therefore I might not do withal, for I have done all that I</a>
<a id='line_2201'>can and made them at accord. Accord, said Sir Launcelot, fie upon that</a>
<a id='line_2202'>accord, for ye shall hear that he shall slay Sir Tristram, or put him</a>
<a id='line_2203'>in a prison, for he is the most coward and the villainest king and</a>
<a id='line_2204'>knight that is now living.</a>
<a id='line_2205'></a>
<a id='line_2206'>And therewith Sir Launcelot departed, and came to King Mark, and said</a>
<a id='line_2207'>to him thus: Sir king, wit thou well the good knight Sir Tristram shall</a>
<a id='line_2208'>go with thee. Beware, I rede thee, of treason, for an thou mischief</a>
<a id='line_2209'>that knight by any manner of falsehood or treason, by the faith I owe</a>
<a id='line_2210'>to God and to the order of knighthood, I shall slay thee with mine own</a>
<a id='line_2211'>hands. Sir Launcelot, said the king, overmuch have ye said to me, and I</a>
<a id='line_2212'>have sworn and said over largely afore King Arthur in hearing of all</a>
<a id='line_2213'>his knights, that I shall not slay nor betray him. It were to me</a>
<a id='line_2214'>overmuch shame to break my promise. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_2215'>but ye are called so false and full of treason that no man may believe</a>
<a id='line_2216'>you. Forsooth it is known well wherefore ye came into this country, and</a>
<a id='line_2217'>for none other cause but for to slay Sir Tristram. So with great dole</a>
<a id='line_2218'>King Mark and Sir Tristram rode together, for it was by Sir Tristram’s</a>
<a id='line_2219'>will and his means to go with King Mark, and all was for the intent to</a>
<a id='line_2220'>see La Beale Isoud, for without the sight of her Sir Tristram might not</a>
<a id='line_2221'>endure.</a>

<a id='line_2227'>how a dumb maid spake, and brought him to the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_2228'></a>
<a id='line_2229'></a>
<a id='line_2230'>Now turn we again unto Sir Lamorak, and speak we of his brethren, Sir</a>
<a id='line_2231'>Tor, which was King Pellinore’s first son and begotten of Aryes, wife</a>
<a id='line_2232'>of the cowherd, for he was a bastard; and Sir Aglovale was his first</a>
<a id='line_2233'>son begotten in wedlock; Sir Lamorak, Dornar, Percivale, these were his</a>
<a id='line_2234'>sons too in wedlock. So when King Mark and Sir Tristram were departed</a>
<a id='line_2235'>from the court there was made great dole and sorrow for the departing</a>
<a id='line_2236'>of Sir Tristram. Then the king and his knights made no manner of joys</a>
<a id='line_2237'>eight days after. And at the eight days’ end there came to the court a</a>
<a id='line_2238'>knight with a young squire with him. And when this knight was unarmed,</a>
<a id='line_2239'>he went to the king and required him to make the young squire a knight.</a>
<a id='line_2240'>Of what lineage is he come? said King Arthur. Sir, said the knight, he</a>
<a id='line_2241'>is the son of King Pellinore, that did you some time good service, and</a>
<a id='line_2242'>he is a brother unto Sir Lamorak de Galis, the good knight. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_2243'>the king, for what cause desire ye that of me that I should make him</a>
<a id='line_2244'>knight? Wit you well, my lord the king, that this young squire is</a>
<a id='line_2245'>brother to me as well as to Sir Lamorak, and my name is Aglavale. Sir</a>
<a id='line_2246'>Aglavale, said Arthur, for the love of Sir Lamorak, and for his</a>
<a id='line_2247'>father’s love, he shall be made knight to-morrow. Now tell me, said</a>
<a id='line_2248'>Arthur, what is his name? Sir, said the knight, his name is Percivale</a>
<a id='line_2249'>de Galis. So on the morn the king made him knight in Camelot. But the</a>
<a id='line_2250'>king and all the knights thought it would be long or that he proved a</a>
<a id='line_2251'>good knight.</a>
<a id='line_2252'></a>
<a id='line_2253'>Then at the dinner, when the king was set at the table, and every</a>
<a id='line_2254'>knight after he was of prowess, the king commanded him to be set among</a>
<a id='line_2255'>mean knights; and so was Sir Percivale set as the king commanded. Then</a>
<a id='line_2256'>was there a maiden in the queen’s court that was come of high blood,</a>
<a id='line_2257'>and she was dumb and never spake word. Right so she came straight into</a>
<a id='line_2258'>the hall, and went unto Sir Percivale, and took him by the hand and</a>
<a id='line_2259'>said aloud, that the king and all the knights might hear it: Arise, Sir</a>
<a id='line_2260'>Percivale, the noble knight and God’s knight, and go with me; and so he</a>
<a id='line_2261'>did. And there she brought him to the right side of the Siege Perilous,</a>
<a id='line_2262'>and said, Fair knight, take here thy siege, for that siege appertaineth</a>
<a id='line_2263'>to thee and to none other. Right so she departed and asked a priest.</a>
<a id='line_2264'>And as she was confessed and houselled then she died. Then the king and</a>
<a id='line_2265'>all the court made great joy of Sir Percivale.</a>

<a id='line_2272'></a>
<a id='line_2273'></a>
<a id='line_2274'>Now turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that much was there praised. Then, by the</a>
<a id='line_2275'>mean of Sir Gawaine and his brethren, they sent for their mother there</a>
<a id='line_2276'>besides, fast by a castle beside Camelot; and all was to that intent to</a>
<a id='line_2277'>slay Sir Lamorak. The Queen of Orkney was there but a while, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_2278'>Lamorak wist of their being, and was full fain; and for to make an end</a>
<a id='line_2279'>of this matter, he sent unto her, and there betwixt them was a night</a>
<a id='line_2280'>assigned that Sir Lamorak should come to her. Thereof was ware Sir</a>
<a id='line_2281'>Gaheris, and there he rode afore the same night, and waited upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_2282'>Lamorak, and then he saw where he came all armed. And where Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_2283'>alighted he tied his horse to a privy postern, and so he went into a</a>
<a id='line_2284'>parlour and unarmed him; and then he went unto the queen’s bed, and she</a>
<a id='line_2285'>made of him passing great joy, and he of her again, for either loved</a>
<a id='line_2286'>other passing sore. So when the knight, Sir Gaheris, saw his time, he</a>
<a id='line_2287'>came to their bedside all armed, with his sword naked, and suddenly gat</a>
<a id='line_2288'>his mother by the hair and struck off her head.</a>
<a id='line_2289'></a>
<a id='line_2290'>When Sir Lamorak saw the blood dash upon him all hot, the which he</a>
<a id='line_2291'>loved passing well, wit you well he was sore abashed and dismayed of</a>
<a id='line_2292'>that dolorous knight. And therewithal, Sir Lamorak leapt out of the bed</a>
<a id='line_2293'>in his shirt as a knight dismayed, saying thus: Ah, Sir Gaheris, knight</a>
<a id='line_2294'>of the Table Round, foul and evil have ye done, and to you great shame.</a>
<a id='line_2295'>Alas, why have ye slain your mother that bare you? with more right ye</a>
<a id='line_2296'>should have slain me. The offence hast thou done, said Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_2297'>notwithstanding a man is born to offer his service; but yet shouldst</a>
<a id='line_2298'>thou beware with whom thou meddlest, for thou hast put me and my</a>
<a id='line_2299'>brethren to a shame, and thy father slew our father; and thou to lie by</a>
<a id='line_2300'>our mother is too much shame for us to suffer. And as for thy father,</a>
<a id='line_2301'>King Pellinore, my brother Sir Gawaine and I slew him. Ye did him the</a>
<a id='line_2302'>more wrong, said Sir Lamorak, for my father slew not your father, it</a>
<a id='line_2303'>was Balin le Savage: and as yet my father’s death is not revenged.</a>
<a id='line_2304'>Leave those words, said Sir Gaheris, for an thou speak feloniously I</a>
<a id='line_2305'>will slay thee. But because thou art naked I am ashamed to slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_2306'>But wit thou well, in what place I may get thee I shall slay thee; and</a>
<a id='line_2307'>now my mother is quit of thee; and withdraw thee and take thine armour,</a>
<a id='line_2308'>that thou were gone. Sir Lamorak saw there was none other bote, but</a>
<a id='line_2309'>fast armed him, and took his horse and rode his way making great</a>
<a id='line_2310'>sorrow. But for the shame and dolour he would not ride to King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_2311'>court, but rode another way.</a>
<a id='line_2312'></a>
<a id='line_2313'>But when it was known that Gaheris had slain his mother the king was</a>
<a id='line_2314'>passing wroth, and commanded him to go out of his court. Wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_2315'>Sir Gawaine was wroth that Gaheris had slain his mother and let Sir</a>
<a id='line_2316'>Lamorak escape. And for this matter was the king passing wroth, and so</a>
<a id='line_2317'>was Sir Launcelot, and many other knights. Sir, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_2318'>here is a great mischief befallen by felony, and by forecast treason,</a>
<a id='line_2319'>that your sister is thus shamefully slain. And I dare say that it was</a>
<a id='line_2320'>wrought by treason, and I dare say ye shall lose that good knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_2321'>Lamorak, the which is great pity. I wot well and am sure, an Sir</a>
<a id='line_2322'>Tristram wist it, he would never more come within your court, the which</a>
<a id='line_2323'>should grieve you much more and all your knights. God defend, said the</a>
<a id='line_2324'>noble King Arthur, that I should lose Sir Lamorak or Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_2325'>then twain of my chief knights of the Table Round were gone. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_2326'>Sir Launcelot, I am sure ye shall lose Sir Lamorak, for Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_2327'>his brethren will slay him by one mean or other; for they among them</a>
<a id='line_2328'>have concluded and sworn to slay him an ever they may see their time.</a>
<a id='line_2329'>That shall I let, said Arthur.</a>

<a id='line_2338'>Now leave we of Sir Lamorak, and speak of Sir Gawaine’s brethren, and</a>

<a id='line_2340'>adventures they met with a knight fleeing, sore wounded; and they asked</a>
<a id='line_2341'>him what tidings. Fair knights, said he, here cometh a knight after me</a>
<a id='line_2342'>that will slay me. With that came Sir Dinadan riding to them by</a>
<a id='line_2343'>adventure, but he would promise them no help. But Sir Agravaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_2344'>Mordred promised him to rescue him. Therewithal came that knight</a>
<a id='line_2345'>straight unto them, and anon he proffered to joust. That saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_2346'>Mordred and rode to him, but he struck Mordred over his horse’s tail.</a>
<a id='line_2347'>That saw Sir Agravaine, and straight he rode toward that knight, and</a>
<a id='line_2348'>right so as he served Mordred so he served Agravaine, and said to them:</a>
<a id='line_2349'>Sirs, wit ye well both that I am Breuse Saunce Pité, that hath done</a>
<a id='line_2350'>this to you. And yet he rode over Agravaine five or six times. When</a>
<a id='line_2351'>Dinadan saw this, he must needs joust with him for shame. And so</a>
<a id='line_2352'>Dinadan and he encountered together, that with pure strength Sir</a>
<a id='line_2353'>Dinadan smote him over his horse’s tail. Then he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_2354'>fled, for he was on foot one of the valiantest knights in Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_2355'>days, and a great destroyer of all good knights.</a>
<a id='line_2356'></a>
<a id='line_2357'>Then rode Sir Dinadan unto Sir Mordred and unto Sir Agravaine. Sir</a>
<a id='line_2358'>knight, said they all, well have ye done, and well have ye revenged us,</a>
<a id='line_2359'>wherefore we pray you tell us your name. Fair sirs, ye ought to know my</a>
<a id='line_2360'>name, the which is called Sir Dinadan. When they understood that it was</a>
<a id='line_2361'>Dinadan they were more wroth than they were before, for they hated him</a>
<a id='line_2362'>out of measure because of Sir Lamorak. For Dinadan had such a custom</a>
<a id='line_2363'>that he loved all good knights that were valiant, and he hated all</a>
<a id='line_2364'>those that were destroyers of good knights. And there were none that</a>
<a id='line_2365'>hated Dinadan but those that ever were called murderers. Then spake the</a>
<a id='line_2366'>hurt knight that Breuse Saunce Pité had chased, his name was Dalan, and</a>
<a id='line_2367'>said: If thou be Dinadan thou slewest my father. It may well be so,</a>
<a id='line_2368'>said Dinadan, but then it was in my defence and at his request. By my</a>
<a id='line_2369'>head, said Dalan, thou shalt die therefore, and therewith he dressed</a>
<a id='line_2370'>his spear and his shield. And to make the shorter tale, Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_2371'>smote him down off his horse, that his neck was nigh broken. And in the</a>
<a id='line_2372'>same wise he smote Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine. And after, in the</a>
<a id='line_2373'>quest of the Sangreal, cowardly and feloniously they slew Dinadan, the</a>
<a id='line_2374'>which was great damage, for he was a great bourder and a passing good</a>
<a id='line_2375'>knight.</a>
<a id='line_2376'></a>
<a id='line_2377'>And so Sir Dinadan rode to a castle that hight Beale-Valet. And there</a>
<a id='line_2378'>he found Sir Palomides that was not yet whole of the wound that Sir</a>
<a id='line_2379'>Lamorak gave him. And there Dinadan told Palomides all the tidings that</a>
<a id='line_2380'>he heard and saw of Sir Tristram, and how he was gone with King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>and with him he hath all his will and desire. Therewith Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_2382'>waxed wroth, for he loved La Beale Isoud. And then he wist well that</a>
<a id='line_2383'>Sir Tristram enjoyed her.</a>
<a id='line_2384'></a>
<a id='line_2385'></a>
<a id='line_2386'></a>
<a id='line_2387'></a>
<a id='line_2388'>CHAPTER XXVI. How King Arthur, the Queen, and Launcelot received</a>
<a id='line_2389'>letters out of Cornwall, and of the answer again.</a>
<a id='line_2390'></a>
<a id='line_2391'></a>
<a id='line_2392'>Now leave we Sir Palomides and Sir Dinadan in the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_2393'>Beale-Valet, and turn we again unto King Arthur. There came a knight</a>
<a id='line_2394'>out of Cornwall, his name was Fergus, a fellow of the Round Table. And</a>
<a id='line_2395'>there he told the king and Sir Launcelot good tidings of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_2396'>and there were brought goodly letters, and how he left him in the</a>
<a id='line_2397'>castle of Tintagil. Then came the damosel that brought goodly letters</a>
<a id='line_2398'>unto King Arthur and unto Sir Launcelot, and there she had passing good</a>
<a id='line_2399'>cheer of the king, and of the Queen Guenever, and of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_2400'>Then they wrote goodly letters again. But Sir Launcelot bade ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_2401'>Tristram beware of King Mark, for ever he called him in his letters</a>
<a id='line_2402'>King Fox, as who saith, he fareth all with wiles and treason. Whereof</a>
<a id='line_2403'>Sir Tristram in his heart thanked Sir Launcelot. Then the damosel went</a>
<a id='line_2404'>unto La Beale Isoud, and bare her letters from the king and from Sir</a>
<a id='line_2405'>Launcelot, whereof she was in passing great joy. Fair damosel, said La</a>
<a id='line_2406'>Beale Isoud, how fareth my Lord Arthur, and the Queen Guenever, and the</a>
<a id='line_2407'>noble knight, Sir Launcelot? She answered, and to make short tale: Much</a>
<a id='line_2408'>the better that ye and Sir Tristram be in joy. God reward them, said La</a>
<a id='line_2409'>Beale Isoud, for Sir Tristram suffereth great pain for me, and I for</a>
<a id='line_2410'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2411'></a>
<a id='line_2412'>So the damosel departed, and brought letters to King Mark. And when he</a>
<a id='line_2413'>had read them, and understood them, he was wroth with Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_2414'>he deemed that he had sent the damosel unto King Arthur. For Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_2415'>Launcelot in a manner threated King Mark. And as King Mark read these</a>
<a id='line_2416'>letters he deemed treason by Sir Tristram. Damosel, said King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_2417'>will ye ride again and bear letters from me unto King Arthur? Sir, she</a>
<a id='line_2418'>said, I will be at your commandment to ride when ye will. Ye say well,</a>
<a id='line_2419'>said the king; come again, said the king, to-morn, and fetch your</a>
<a id='line_2420'>letters. Then she departed and told them how she should ride again with</a>
<a id='line_2421'>letters unto Arthur. Then we pray you, said La Beale Isoud and Sir</a>
<a id='line_2422'>Tristram, that when ye have received your letters, that ye would come</a>
<a id='line_2423'>by us that we may see the privity of your letters. All that I may do,</a>
<a id='line_2424'>madam, ye wot well I must do for Sir Tristram, for I have been long his</a>
<a id='line_2425'>own maiden.</a>
<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>So on the morn the damosel went to King Mark to have had his letters</a>
<a id='line_2428'>and to depart. I am not avised, said King Mark, as at this time to send</a>
<a id='line_2429'>my letters. Then privily and secretly he sent letters unto King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2430'>and unto Queen Guenever, and unto Sir Launcelot. So the varlet</a>
<a id='line_2431'>departed, and found the king and the queen in Wales, at Carlion. And as</a>
<a id='line_2432'>the king and the queen were at mass the varlet came with the letters.</a>
<a id='line_2433'>And when mass was done the king and the queen opened the letters</a>
<a id='line_2434'>privily by themself. And the beginning of the king’s letters spake</a>
<a id='line_2435'>wonderly short unto King Arthur, and bade him entermete with himself</a>
<a id='line_2436'>and with his wife, and of his knights; for he was able enough to rule</a>
<a id='line_2437'>and keep his wife.</a>
<a id='line_2438'></a>
<a id='line_2439'></a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'></a>
<a id='line_2442'>CHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Launcelot was wroth with the letter that he</a>
<a id='line_2443'>received from King Mark, and of Dinadan which made a lay of King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_2444'></a>
<a id='line_2445'></a>
<a id='line_2446'>When King Arthur understood the letter, he mused of many things, and</a>
<a id='line_2447'>thought on his sister’s words, Queen Morgan le Fay, that she had said</a>
<a id='line_2448'>betwixt Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot. And in this thought he</a>
<a id='line_2449'>studied a great while. Then he bethought him again how his sister was</a>
<a id='line_2450'>his own enemy, and that she hated the queen and Sir Launcelot, and so</a>
<a id='line_2451'>he put all that out of his thought. Then King Arthur read the letter</a>
<a id='line_2452'>again, and the latter clause said that King Mark took Sir Tristram for</a>
<a id='line_2453'>his mortal enemy; wherefore he put Arthur out of doubt he would be</a>
<a id='line_2454'>revenged of Sir Tristram. Then was King Arthur wroth with King Mark.</a>
<a id='line_2455'>And when Queen Guenever read her letter and understood it, she was</a>
<a id='line_2456'>wroth out of measure, for the letter spake shame by her and by Sir</a>
<a id='line_2457'>Launcelot. And so privily she sent the letter unto Sir Launcelot. And</a>
<a id='line_2458'>when he wist the intent of the letter he was so wroth that he laid him</a>
<a id='line_2459'>down on his bed to sleep, whereof Sir Dinadan was ware, for it was his</a>
<a id='line_2460'>manner to be privy with all good knights. And as Sir Launcelot slept he</a>
<a id='line_2461'>stole the letter out of his hand, and read it word by word. And then he</a>
<a id='line_2462'>made great sorrow for anger. And so Sir Launcelot awaked, and went to a</a>
<a id='line_2463'>window, and read the letter again, the which made him angry.</a>
<a id='line_2464'></a>
<a id='line_2465'>Sir, said Dinadan, wherefore be ye angry? discover your heart to me:</a>
<a id='line_2466'>forsooth ye wot well I owe you good will, howbeit I am a poor knight</a>
<a id='line_2467'>and a servitor unto you and to all good knights. For though I be not of</a>
<a id='line_2468'>worship myself I love all those that be of worship. It is truth, said</a>
<a id='line_2469'>Sir Launcelot, ye are a trusty knight, and for great trust I will shew</a>
<a id='line_2470'>you my counsel. And when Dinadan understood all, he said: This is my</a>
<a id='line_2471'>counsel: set you right nought by these threats, for King Mark is so</a>
<a id='line_2472'>villainous, that by fair speech shall never man get of him. But ye</a>
<a id='line_2473'>shall see what I shall do; I will make a lay for him, and when it is</a>
<a id='line_2474'>made I shall make an harper to sing it afore him. So anon he went and</a>
<a id='line_2475'>made it, and taught it an harper that hight Eliot. And when he could</a>
<a id='line_2476'>it, he taught it to many harpers. And so by the will of Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_2477'>and of Arthur, the harpers went straight into Wales, and into Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_2478'>to sing the lay that Sir Dinadan made by King Mark, the which was the</a>
<a id='line_2479'>worst lay that ever harper sang with harp or with any other</a>
<a id='line_2480'>instruments.</a>
<a id='line_2481'></a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'></a>
<a id='line_2484'></a>
<a id='line_2485'>CHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Tristram was hurt, and of a war made to King</a>
<a id='line_2486'>Mark; and of Sir Tristram how he promised to rescue him.</a>
<a id='line_2487'></a>
<a id='line_2488'></a>
<a id='line_2489'>Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram and to King Mark. As Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_2490'>was at jousts and at tournament it fortuned he was sore hurt both with</a>
<a id='line_2491'>a spear and with a sword, but yet he won always the degree. And for to</a>
<a id='line_2492'>repose him he went to a good knight that dwelled in Cornwall, in a</a>
<a id='line_2493'>castle, whose name was Sir Dinas le Seneschal. Then by misfortune there</a>
<a id='line_2494'>came out of Sessoin a great number of men of arms, and an hideous host,</a>
<a id='line_2495'>and they entered nigh the Castle of Tintagil; and their captain’s name</a>
<a id='line_2496'>was Elias, a good man of arms. When King Mark understood his enemies</a>
<a id='line_2497'>were entered into his land he made great dole and sorrow, for in no</a>
<a id='line_2498'>wise by his will King Mark would not send for Sir Tristram, for he</a>
<a id='line_2499'>hated him deadly.</a>
<a id='line_2500'></a>
<a id='line_2501'>So when his council was come they devised and cast many perils of the</a>
<a id='line_2502'>strength of their enemies. And then they concluded all at once, and</a>
<a id='line_2503'>said thus unto King Mark: Sir, wit ye well ye must send for Sir</a>
<a id='line_2504'>Tristram, the good knight, or else they will never be overcome. For by</a>
<a id='line_2505'>Sir Tristram they must be foughten withal, or else we row against the</a>
<a id='line_2506'>stream. Well, said King Mark, I will do by your counsel; but yet he was</a>
<a id='line_2507'>full loath thereto, but need constrained him to send for him. Then was</a>
<a id='line_2508'>he sent for in all haste that might be, that he should come to King</a>
<a id='line_2509'>Mark. And when he understood that King Mark had sent for him, he</a>
<a id='line_2510'>mounted upon a soft ambler and rode to King Mark. And when he was come</a>
<a id='line_2511'>the king said thus: Fair nephew Sir Tristram, this is all. Here be come</a>
<a id='line_2512'>our enemies of Sessoin, that are here nigh hand, and without tarrying</a>
<a id='line_2513'>they must be met with shortly, or else they will destroy this country.</a>
<a id='line_2514'>Sir, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well all my power is at your</a>
<a id='line_2515'>commandment. And wit ye well, sir, these eight days I may bear none</a>
<a id='line_2516'>arms, for my wounds be not yet whole. And by that day I shall do what I</a>
<a id='line_2517'>may. Ye say well, said King Mark; then go ye again and repose you and</a>
<a id='line_2518'>make you fresh, and I shall go and meet the Sessoins with all my power.</a>
<a id='line_2519'></a>
<a id='line_2520'>So the king departed unto Tintagil, and Sir Tristram went to repose</a>
<a id='line_2521'>him. And the king made a great host and departed them in three; the</a>
<a id='line_2522'>first part led Sir Dinas the Seneschal, and Sir Andred led the second</a>
<a id='line_2523'>part, and Sir Argius led the third part; and he was of the blood of</a>
<a id='line_2524'>King Mark. And the Sessoins had three great battles, and many good men</a>
<a id='line_2525'>of arms. And so King Mark by the advice of his knights issued out of</a>
<a id='line_2526'>the Castle of Tintagil upon his enemies. And Dinas, the good knight,</a>
<a id='line_2527'>rode out afore, and slew two knights with his own hands, and then began</a>
<a id='line_2528'>the battles. And there was marvellous breaking of spears and smiting of</a>
<a id='line_2529'>swords, and slew down many good knights. And ever was Sir Dinas the</a>
<a id='line_2530'>Seneschal the best of King Mark’s party. And thus the battle endured</a>
<a id='line_2531'>long with great mortality. But at the last King Mark and Sir Dinas,</a>
<a id='line_2532'>were they never so loath, they withdrew them to the Castle of Tintagil</a>
<a id='line_2533'>with great slaughter of people; and the Sessoins followed on fast, that</a>
<a id='line_2534'>ten of them were put within the gates and four slain with the</a>
<a id='line_2535'>portcullis.</a>
<a id='line_2536'></a>
<a id='line_2537'>Then King Mark sent for Sir Tristram by a varlet, that told him all the</a>
<a id='line_2538'>mortality. Then he sent the varlet again, and bade him: Tell King Mark</a>
<a id='line_2539'>that I will come as soon as I am whole, for erst I may do him no good.</a>
<a id='line_2540'>Then King Mark had his answer. Therewith came Elias and bade the king</a>
<a id='line_2541'>yield up the castle: For ye may not hold it no while. Sir Elias, said</a>
<a id='line_2542'>the king, so will I yield up the castle if I be not soon rescued. Anon</a>
<a id='line_2543'>King Mark sent again for rescue to Sir Tristram. By then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_2544'>was whole, and he had gotten him ten good knights of Arthur’s; and with</a>
<a id='line_2545'>them he rode unto Tintagil. And when he saw the great host of Sessoins</a>
<a id='line_2546'>he marvelled wonder greatly. And then Sir Tristram rode by the woods</a>
<a id='line_2547'>and by the ditches as secretly as he might, till he came nigh the</a>
<a id='line_2548'>gates. And there dressed a knight to him when he saw that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_2549'>would enter; and Sir Tristram smote him down dead, and so he served</a>
<a id='line_2550'>three more. And everych of these ten knights slew a man of arms. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_2551'>Tristram entered into the Castle of Tintagil. And when King Mark wist</a>
<a id='line_2552'>that Sir Tristram was come he was glad of his coming, and so was all</a>
<a id='line_2553'>the fellowship, and of him they made great joy.</a>
<a id='line_2554'></a>
<a id='line_2555'></a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'></a>
<a id='line_2558'>CHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Tristram overcame the battle, and how Elias</a>
<a id='line_2559'>desired a man to fight body for body.</a>
<a id='line_2560'></a>
<a id='line_2561'></a>
<a id='line_2562'>So on the morn Elias the captain came, and bade King Mark: Come out and</a>
<a id='line_2563'>do battle; for now the good knight Sir Tristram is entered it will be</a>
<a id='line_2564'>shame to thee, said Elias, for to keep thy walls. When King Mark</a>
<a id='line_2565'>understood this he was wroth and said no word, but went unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_2566'>Tristram and asked him his counsel. Sir, said Sir Tristram, will ye</a>
<a id='line_2567'>that I give him his answer? I will well, said King Mark. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_2568'>Tristram said thus to the messenger: Bear thy lord word from the king</a>
<a id='line_2569'>and me, that we will do battle with him to-morn in the plain field.</a>
<a id='line_2570'>What is your name? said the messenger. Wit thou well my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_2571'>Tristram de Liones. Therewithal the messenger departed and told his</a>
<a id='line_2572'>lord Elias all that he had heard. Sir, said Sir Tristram unto King</a>
<a id='line_2573'>Mark, I pray you give me leave to have the rule of the battle. I pray</a>
<a id='line_2574'>you take the rule, said King Mark. Then Sir Tristram let devise the</a>
<a id='line_2575'>battle in what manner that it should be. He let depart his host in six</a>
<a id='line_2576'>parties, and ordained Sir Dinas the Seneschal to have the foreward, and</a>
<a id='line_2577'>other knights to rule the remnant. And the same night Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_2578'>burnt all the Sessoins’ ships unto the cold water. Anon, as Elias wist</a>
<a id='line_2579'>that, he said it was of Sir Tristram’s doing: For he casteth that we</a>
<a id='line_2580'>shall never escape, mother son of us. Therefore, fair fellows, fight</a>
<a id='line_2581'>freely to-morrow, and miscomfort you nought; for any knight, though he</a>
<a id='line_2582'>be the best knight in the world, he may not have ado with us all.</a>
<a id='line_2583'></a>
<a id='line_2584'>Then they ordained their battle in four parties, wonderly well</a>
<a id='line_2585'>apparelled and garnished with men of arms. Thus they within issued, and</a>
<a id='line_2586'>they without set freely upon them; and there Sir Dinas did great deeds</a>
<a id='line_2587'>of arms. Not for then Sir Dinas and his fellowship were put to the</a>
<a id='line_2588'>worse. With that came Sir Tristram and slew two knights with one spear;</a>
<a id='line_2589'>then he slew on the right hand and on the left hand, that men marvelled</a>
<a id='line_2590'>that ever he might do such deeds of arms. And then he might see</a>
<a id='line_2591'>sometime the battle was driven a bow-draught from the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_2592'>sometime it was at the gates of the castle. Then came Elias the captain</a>
<a id='line_2593'>rushing here and there, and hit King Mark so sore upon the helm that he</a>
<a id='line_2594'>made him to avoid the saddle. And then Sir Dinas gat King Mark again to</a>
<a id='line_2595'>horseback. Therewithal came in Sir Tristram like a lion, and there he</a>
<a id='line_2596'>met with Elias, and he smote him so sore upon the helm that he avoided</a>
<a id='line_2597'>his saddle. And thus they fought till it was night, and for great</a>
<a id='line_2598'>slaughter and for wounded people everych party drew to their rest.</a>
<a id='line_2599'></a>
<a id='line_2600'>And when King Mark was come within the Castle of Tintagil he lacked of</a>
<a id='line_2601'>his knights an hundred, and they without lacked two hundred; and they</a>
<a id='line_2602'>searched the wounded men on both parties. And then they went to</a>
<a id='line_2603'>council; and wit you well either party were loath to fight more, so</a>
<a id='line_2604'>that either might escape with their worship. When Elias the captain</a>
<a id='line_2605'>understood the death of his men he made great dole; and when he wist</a>
<a id='line_2606'>that they were loath to go to battle again he was wroth out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_2607'>Then Elias sent word unto King Mark, in great despite, whether he would</a>
<a id='line_2608'>find a knight that would fight for him body for body. And if that he</a>
<a id='line_2609'>might slay King Mark’s knight, he to have the truage of Cornwall</a>
<a id='line_2610'>yearly. And if that his knight slay mine, I fully release my claim</a>
<a id='line_2611'>forever. Then the messenger departed unto King Mark, and told him how</a>
<a id='line_2612'>that his lord Elias had sent him word to find a knight to do battle</a>
<a id='line_2613'>with him body for body. When King Mark understood the messenger, he</a>
<a id='line_2614'>bade him abide and he should have his answer. Then called he all the</a>
<a id='line_2615'>baronage together to wit what was the best counsel. They said all at</a>
<a id='line_2616'>once: To fight in a field we have no lust, for had not been Sir</a>
<a id='line_2617'>Tristram’s prowess it had been likely that we never should have</a>
<a id='line_2618'>escaped; and therefore, sir, as we deem, it were well done to find a</a>
<a id='line_2619'>knight that would do battle with him, for he knightly proffereth.</a>

<a id='line_2624'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Elias and Sir Tristram fought together for the</a>
<a id='line_2625'>truage, and how Sir Tristram slew Elias in the field.</a>
<a id='line_2626'></a>
<a id='line_2627'></a>
<a id='line_2628'>Not for then when all this was said, they could find no knight that</a>
<a id='line_2629'>would do battle with him. Sir king, said they all, here is no knight</a>
<a id='line_2630'>that dare fight with Elias. Alas, said King Mark, then am I utterly</a>
<a id='line_2631'>ashamed and utterly destroyed, unless that my nephew Sir Tristram will</a>
<a id='line_2632'>take the battle upon him. Wit you well, they said all, he had yesterday</a>
<a id='line_2633'>overmuch on hand, and he is weary for travail, and sore wounded. Where</a>
<a id='line_2634'>is he? said King Mark. Sir, said they, he is in his bed to repose him.</a>
<a id='line_2635'>Alas, said King Mark, but I have the succour of my nephew Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_2636'>I am utterly destroyed for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2637'></a>
<a id='line_2638'>Therewith one went to Sir Tristram where he lay, and told him what King</a>
<a id='line_2639'>Mark had said. And therewith Sir Tristram arose lightly, and put on him</a>
<a id='line_2640'>a long gown, and came afore the king and all the lords. And when he saw</a>
<a id='line_2641'>them all so dismayed he asked the king and the lords what tidings were</a>
<a id='line_2642'>with them. Never worse, said the king. And therewith he told him all,</a>
<a id='line_2643'>how he had word of Elias to find a knight to fight for the truage of</a>
<a id='line_2644'>Cornwall, and none can I find. And as for you, said the king and all</a>
<a id='line_2645'>the lords, we may ask no more of you for shame; for through your</a>
<a id='line_2646'>hardiness yesterday ye saved all our lives. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now</a>
<a id='line_2647'>I understand ye would have my succour, reason would that I should do</a>
<a id='line_2648'>all that lieth in my power to do, saving my worship and my life,</a>
<a id='line_2649'>howbeit I am sore bruised and hurt. And sithen Sir Elias proffereth so</a>
<a id='line_2650'>largely, I shall fight with him, or else I will be slain in the field,</a>
<a id='line_2651'>or else I will deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And therefore</a>
<a id='line_2652'>lightly call his messenger and he shall be answered, for as yet my</a>
<a id='line_2653'>wounds be green, and they will be sorer a seven night after than they</a>
<a id='line_2654'>be now; and therefore he shall have his answer that I will do battle</a>
<a id='line_2655'>to-morn with him.</a>
<a id='line_2656'></a>
<a id='line_2657'>Then was the messenger departed brought before King Mark. Hark, my</a>
<a id='line_2658'>fellow, said Sir Tristram, go fast unto thy lord, and bid him make true</a>
<a id='line_2659'>assurance on his part for the truage, as the king here shall make on</a>
<a id='line_2660'>his part; and then tell thy lord, Sir Elias, that I, Sir Tristram, King</a>
<a id='line_2661'>Arthur’s knight, and knight of the Table Round, will as to-morn meet</a>
<a id='line_2662'>with thy lord on horseback, to do battle as long as my horse may</a>
<a id='line_2663'>endure, and after that to do battle with him on foot to the utterance.</a>
<a id='line_2664'>The messenger beheld Sir Tristram from the top to the toe; and</a>
<a id='line_2665'>therewithal he departed and came to his lord, and told him how he was</a>
<a id='line_2666'>answered of Sir Tristram. And therewithal was made hostage on both</a>
<a id='line_2667'>parties, and made it as sure as it might be, that whether party had the</a>
<a id='line_2668'>victory, so to end. And then were both hosts assembled on both parts of</a>
<a id='line_2669'>the field, without the Castle of Tintagil, and there was none but Sir</a>
<a id='line_2670'>Tristram and Sir Elias armed.</a>
<a id='line_2671'></a>
<a id='line_2672'>So when the appointment was made, they departed in-sunder, and they</a>
<a id='line_2673'>came together with all the might that their horses might run. And</a>
<a id='line_2674'>either knight smote other so hard that both horses and knights went to</a>
<a id='line_2675'>the earth. Not for then they both lightly arose and dressed their</a>
<a id='line_2676'>shields on their shoulders, with naked swords in their hands, and they</a>
<a id='line_2677'>dashed together that it seemed a flaming fire about them. Thus they</a>
<a id='line_2678'>traced, and traversed, and hewed on helms and hauberks, and cut away</a>
<a id='line_2679'>many cantels of their shields, and either wounded other passing sore,</a>
<a id='line_2680'>so that the hot blood fell freshly upon the earth. And by then they had</a>
<a id='line_2681'>foughten the mountenance of an hour Sir Tristram waxed faint and</a>
<a id='line_2682'>for-bled, and gave sore aback. That saw Sir Elias, and followed</a>
<a id='line_2683'>fiercely upon him, and wounded him in many places. And ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_2684'>Tristram traced and traversed, and went froward him here and there, and</a>
<a id='line_2685'>covered him with his shield as he might all weakly, that all men said</a>
<a id='line_2686'>he was overcome; for Sir Elias had given him twenty strokes against</a>
<a id='line_2687'>one.</a>
<a id='line_2688'></a>
<a id='line_2689'>Then was there laughing of the Sessoins’ party, and great dole on King</a>
<a id='line_2690'>Mark’s party. Alas, said the king, we are ashamed and destroyed all for</a>
<a id='line_2691'>ever: for as the book saith, Sir Tristram was never so matched, but if</a>
<a id='line_2692'>it were Sir Launcelot. Thus as they stood and beheld both parties, that</a>
<a id='line_2693'>one party laughing and the other party weeping, Sir Tristram remembered</a>
<a id='line_2694'>him of his lady, La Beale Isoud, that looked upon him, and how he was</a>
<a id='line_2695'>likely never to come in her presence. Then he pulled up his shield that</a>
<a id='line_2696'>erst hung full low. And then he dressed up his shield unto Elias, and</a>
<a id='line_2697'>gave him many sad strokes, twenty against one, and all to-brake his</a>
<a id='line_2698'>shield and his hauberk, that the hot blood ran down to the earth. Then</a>
<a id='line_2699'>began King Mark to laugh, and all Cornish men, and that other party to</a>
<a id='line_2700'>weep. And ever Sir Tristram said to Sir Elias: Yield thee.</a>
<a id='line_2701'></a>
<a id='line_2702'>Then when Sir Tristram saw him so staggering on the ground, he said:</a>
<a id='line_2703'>Sir Elias, I am right sorry for thee, for thou art a passing good</a>
<a id='line_2704'>knight as ever I met withal, except Sir Launcelot. Therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_2705'>Elias fell to the earth, and there died. What shall I do, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_2706'>Tristram unto King Mark, for this battle is at an end? Then they of</a>
<a id='line_2707'>Elias’ party departed, and King Mark took of them many prisoners, to</a>
<a id='line_2708'>redress the harms and the scathes that he had of them; and the remnant</a>
<a id='line_2709'>he sent into their country to borrow out their fellows. Then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_2710'>Tristram searched and well healed. Yet for all this King Mark would</a>
<a id='line_2711'>fain have slain Sir Tristram. But for all that ever Sir Tristram saw or</a>
<a id='line_2712'>heard by King Mark, yet would he never beware of his treason, but ever</a>
<a id='line_2713'>he would be thereas La Beale Isoud was.</a>
<a id='line_2714'></a>
<a id='line_2715'></a>

<a id='line_2717'></a>
<a id='line_2718'>CHAPTER XXXI. How at a great feast that King Mark made an harper came</a>
<a id='line_2719'>and sang the lay that Dinadan had made.</a>
<a id='line_2720'></a>
<a id='line_2721'></a>
<a id='line_2722'>Now will we pass of this matter, and speak we of the harpers that Sir</a>
<a id='line_2723'>Launcelot and Sir Dinadan had sent into Cornwall. And at the great</a>
<a id='line_2724'>feast that King Mark made for joy that the Sessoins were put out of his</a>
<a id='line_2725'>country, then came Eliot the harper with the lay that Dinadan had made</a>
<a id='line_2726'>and secretly brought it unto Sir Tristram, and told him the lay that</a>
<a id='line_2727'>Dinadan had made by King Mark. And when Sir Tristram heard it, he said:</a>
<a id='line_2728'>O Lord Jesu, that Dinadan can make wonderly well and ill, thereas it</a>
<a id='line_2729'>shall be. Sir, said Eliot, dare I sing this song afore King Mark? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_2730'>on my peril, said Sir Tristram, for I shall be thy warrant. Then at the</a>
<a id='line_2731'>meat came in Eliot the harper, and because he was a curious harper men</a>
<a id='line_2732'>heard him sing the same lay that Dinadan had made, the which spake the</a>
<a id='line_2733'>most villainy by King Mark of his treason that ever man heard.</a>
<a id='line_2734'></a>
<a id='line_2735'>When the harper had sung his song to the end King Mark was wonderly</a>
<a id='line_2736'>wroth, and said: Thou harper, how durst thou be so bold on thy head to</a>
<a id='line_2737'>sing this song afore me. Sir, said Eliot, wit you well I am a minstrel,</a>
<a id='line_2738'>and I must do as I am commanded of these lords that I bear the arms of.</a>
<a id='line_2739'>And sir, wit ye well that Sir Dinadan, a knight of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_2740'>made this song, and made me to sing it afore you. Thou sayest well,</a>
<a id='line_2741'>said King Mark, and because thou art a minstrel thou shalt go quit, but</a>
<a id='line_2742'>I charge thee hie thee fast out of my sight. So the harper departed and</a>
<a id='line_2743'>went to Sir Tristram, and told him how he had sped. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_2744'>let make letters as goodly as he could to Launcelot and to Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_2745'>And so he let conduct the harper out of the country. But to say that</a>
<a id='line_2746'>King Mark was wonderly wroth, he was, for he deemed that the lay that</a>
<a id='line_2747'>was sung afore him was made by Sir Tristram’s counsel, wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_2748'>thought to slay him and all his well-willers in that country.</a>

<a id='line_2753'>CHAPTER XXXII. How King Mark slew by treason his brother Boudwin, for</a>
<a id='line_2754'>good service that he had done to him.</a>
<a id='line_2755'></a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>Now turn we to another matter that fell between King Mark and his</a>
<a id='line_2758'>brother, that was called the good Prince Boudwin, that all the people</a>
<a id='line_2759'>of the country loved passing well. So it befell on a time that the</a>
<a id='line_2760'>miscreant Saracens landed in the country of Cornwall soon after these</a>
<a id='line_2761'>Sessoins were gone. And then the good Prince Boudwin, at the landing,</a>
<a id='line_2762'>he raised the country privily and hastily. And or it were day he let</a>
<a id='line_2763'>put wildfire in three of his own ships, and suddenly he pulled up the</a>
<a id='line_2764'>sail, and with the wind he made those ships to be driven among the navy</a>
<a id='line_2765'>of the Saracens. And to make short tale, those three ships set on fire</a>
<a id='line_2766'>all the ships, that none were saved. And at point of the day the good</a>
<a id='line_2767'>Prince Boudwin with all his fellowship set on the miscreants with</a>
<a id='line_2768'>shouts and cries, and slew to the number of forty thousand, and left</a>
<a id='line_2769'>none alive.</a>
<a id='line_2770'></a>
<a id='line_2771'>When King Mark wist this he was wonderly wroth that his brother should</a>
<a id='line_2772'>win such worship. And because this prince was better beloved than he in</a>
<a id='line_2773'>all that country, and that also Boudwin loved well Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>therefore he thought to slay him. And thus, hastily, as a man out of</a>
<a id='line_2775'>his wit, he sent for Prince Boudwin and Anglides his wife, and bade</a>
<a id='line_2776'>them bring their young son with them, that he might see him. All this</a>
<a id='line_2777'>he did to the intent to slay the child as well as his father, for he</a>
<a id='line_2778'>was the falsest traitor that ever was born. Alas, for his goodness and</a>
<a id='line_2779'>for his good deeds this gentle Prince Boudwin was slain. So when he</a>
<a id='line_2780'>came with his wife Anglides, the king made them fair semblant till they</a>
<a id='line_2781'>had dined. And when they had dined King Mark sent for his brother and</a>
<a id='line_2782'>said thus: Brother, how sped you when the miscreants arrived by you?</a>
<a id='line_2783'>meseemeth it had been your part to have sent me word, that I might have</a>
<a id='line_2784'>been at that journey, for it had been reason that I had had the honour</a>
<a id='line_2785'>and not you. Sir, said the Prince Boudwin, it was so that an I had</a>
<a id='line_2786'>tarried till that I had sent for you those miscreants had destroyed my</a>
<a id='line_2787'>country. Thou liest, false traitor, said King Mark, for thou art ever</a>
<a id='line_2788'>about for to win worship from me, and put me to dishonour, and thou</a>
<a id='line_2789'>cherishest that I hate. And therewith he struck him to the heart with a</a>
<a id='line_2790'>dagger, that he never after spake word. Then the Lady Anglides made</a>
<a id='line_2791'>great dole, and swooned, for she saw her lord slain afore her face.</a>
<a id='line_2792'>Then was there no more to do but Prince Boudwin was despoiled and</a>
<a id='line_2793'>brought to burial. But Anglides privily gat her husband’s doublet and</a>
<a id='line_2794'>his shirt, and that she kept secretly.</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>Then was there much sorrow and crying, and great dole made Sir</a>
<a id='line_2797'>Tristram, Sir Dinas, Sir Fergus, and so did all knights that were</a>
<a id='line_2798'>there; for that prince was passingly well beloved. So La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_2799'>sent unto Anglides, the Prince Boudwin’s wife, and bade her avoid</a>
<a id='line_2800'>lightly or else her young son, Alisander le Orphelin, should be slain.</a>
<a id='line_2801'>When she heard this, she took her horse and her child; and rode with</a>
<a id='line_2802'>such poor men as durst ride with her.</a>
<a id='line_2803'></a>
<a id='line_2804'></a>
<a id='line_2805'></a>
<a id='line_2806'></a>
<a id='line_2807'>CHAPTER XXXIII. How Anglides, Boudwin’s wife, escaped with her young</a>
<a id='line_2808'>son, Alisander le Orphelin, and came to the Castle of Arundel.</a>
<a id='line_2809'></a>
<a id='line_2810'></a>
<a id='line_2811'>Notwithstanding, when King Mark had done this deed, yet he thought to</a>
<a id='line_2812'>do more vengeance; and with his sword in his hand, he sought from</a>
<a id='line_2813'>chamber to chamber, to seek Anglides and her young son. And when she</a>
<a id='line_2814'>was missed he called a good knight that hight Sadok, and charged him by</a>
<a id='line_2815'>pain of death to fetch Anglides again and her young son. So Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_2816'>departed and rode after Anglides. And within ten mile he overtook her,</a>
<a id='line_2817'>and bade her turn again and ride with him to King Mark. Alas, fair</a>
<a id='line_2818'>knight, she said, what shall ye win by my son’s death or by mine? I</a>
<a id='line_2819'>have had overmuch harm and too great a loss. Madam, said Sadok, of your</a>
<a id='line_2820'>loss is dole and pity; but madam, said Sadok, would ye depart out of</a>
<a id='line_2821'>this country with your son, and keep him till he be of age, that he may</a>
<a id='line_2822'>revenge his father’s death, then would I suffer you to depart from me,</a>
<a id='line_2823'>so you promise me to revenge the death of Prince Boudwin. Ah, gentle</a>
<a id='line_2824'>knight, Jesu thank thee, and if ever my son, Alisander le Orphelin,</a>
<a id='line_2825'>live to be a knight, he shall have his father’s doublet and his shirt</a>
<a id='line_2826'>with the bloody marks, and I shall give him such a charge that he shall</a>
<a id='line_2827'>remember it while he liveth. And therewithal Sadok departed from her,</a>
<a id='line_2828'>and either betook other to God. And when Sadok came to King Mark he</a>
<a id='line_2829'>told him faithfully that he had drowned young Alisander her son; and</a>
<a id='line_2830'>thereof King Mark was full glad.</a>
<a id='line_2831'></a>
<a id='line_2832'>Now turn we unto Anglides, that rode both night and day by adventure</a>
<a id='line_2833'>out of Cornwall, and little and in few places she rested; but ever she</a>
<a id='line_2834'>drew southward to the seaside, till by fortune she came to a castle</a>
<a id='line_2835'>that is called Magouns, and now it is called Arundel, in Sussex. And</a>
<a id='line_2836'>the Constable of the castle welcomed her, and said she was welcome to</a>
<a id='line_2837'>her own castle; and there was Anglides worshipfully received, for the</a>
<a id='line_2838'>Constable’s wife was nigh her cousin, and the Constable’s name was</a>
<a id='line_2839'>Bellangere; and that same Constable told Anglides that the same castle</a>
<a id='line_2840'>was hers by right inheritance. Thus Anglides endured years and winters,</a>
<a id='line_2841'>till Alisander was big and strong; there was none so wight in all that</a>
<a id='line_2842'>country, neither there was none that might do no manner of mastery</a>
<a id='line_2843'>afore him.</a>
<a id='line_2844'></a>
<a id='line_2845'></a>

<a id='line_2847'></a>
<a id='line_2848'>CHAPTER XXXIV. How Anglides gave the bloody doublet to Alisander, her</a>
<a id='line_2849'>son, the same day that he was made knight, and the charge withal.</a>
<a id='line_2850'></a>
<a id='line_2851'></a>
<a id='line_2852'>Then upon a day Bellangere the Constable came to Anglides and said:</a>
<a id='line_2853'>Madam, it were time my lord Alisander were made knight, for he is a</a>
<a id='line_2854'>passing strong young man. Sir, said she, I would he were made knight;</a>
<a id='line_2855'>but then must I give him the most charge that ever sinful mother gave</a>
<a id='line_2856'>to her child. Do as ye list, said Bellangere, and I shall give him</a>
<a id='line_2857'>warning that he shall be made knight. Now it will be well done that he</a>
<a id='line_2858'>may be made knight at our Lady Day in Lent. Be it so, said Anglides,</a>
<a id='line_2859'>and I pray you make ready therefore. So came the Constable to</a>
<a id='line_2860'>Alisander, and told him that he should at our Lady Day in Lent be made</a>
<a id='line_2861'>knight. I thank God, said Alisander; these are the best tidings that</a>
<a id='line_2862'>ever came to me. Then the Constable ordained twenty of the greatest</a>
<a id='line_2863'>gentlemen’s sons, and the best born men of the country, that should be</a>
<a id='line_2864'>made knights that same day that Alisander was made knight. So on the</a>
<a id='line_2865'>same day that Alisander and his twenty fellows were made knights, at</a>
<a id='line_2866'>the offering of the mass there came Anglides unto her son and said</a>
<a id='line_2867'>thus: O fair sweet son, I charge thee upon my blessing, and of the high</a>
<a id='line_2868'>order of chivalry that thou takest here this day, that thou understand</a>
<a id='line_2869'>what I shall say and charge thee withal. Therewithal she pulled out a</a>
<a id='line_2870'>bloody doublet and a bloody shirt, that were be-bled with old blood.</a>
<a id='line_2871'>When Alisander saw this he stert aback and waxed pale, and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_2872'>mother, what may this mean? I shall tell thee, fair son: this was thine</a>
<a id='line_2873'>own father’s doublet and shirt, that he wore upon him that same day</a>
<a id='line_2874'>that he was slain. And there she told him why and wherefore, and how</a>
<a id='line_2875'>for his goodness King Mark slew him with his dagger afore mine own</a>
<a id='line_2876'>eyen. And therefore this shall be your charge that I shall give thee.</a>
<a id='line_2877'></a>

<a id='line_2880'></a>
<a id='line_2881'>CHAPTER XXXV. How it was told to King Mark of Sir Alisander, and how he</a>
<a id='line_2882'>would have slain Sir Sadok for saving his life.</a>
<a id='line_2883'></a>
<a id='line_2884'></a>
<a id='line_2885'>Now I require thee, and charge thee upon my blessing, and upon the high</a>
<a id='line_2886'>order of knighthood, that thou be revenged upon King Mark for the death</a>
<a id='line_2887'>of thy father. And therewithal she swooned. Then Alisander leapt to his</a>
<a id='line_2888'>mother, and took her up in his arms, and said: Fair mother, ye have</a>
<a id='line_2889'>given me a great charge, and here I promise you I shall be avenged upon</a>
<a id='line_2890'>King Mark when that I may; and that I promise to God and to you. So</a>
<a id='line_2891'>this feast was ended, and the Constable, by the advice of Anglides, let</a>
<a id='line_2892'>purvey that Alisander was well horsed and harnessed. Then he jousted</a>
<a id='line_2893'>with his twenty fellows that were made knights with him, but for to</a>
<a id='line_2894'>make a short tale, he overthrew all those twenty, that none might</a>
<a id='line_2895'>withstand him a buffet.</a>
<a id='line_2896'></a>
<a id='line_2897'>Then one of those knights departed unto King Mark, and told him all,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>how Alisander was made knight, and all the charge that his mother gave</a>
<a id='line_2899'>him, as ye have heard afore time. Alas, false treason, said King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_2900'>I weened that young traitor had been dead. Alas, whom may I trust? And</a>
<a id='line_2901'>therewithal King Mark took a sword in his hand; and sought Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_2902'>from chamber to chamber to slay him. When Sir Sadok saw King Mark come</a>
<a id='line_2903'>with his sword in his hand he said thus: Beware, King Mark, and come</a>
<a id='line_2904'>not nigh me; for wit thou well that I saved Alisander his life, of</a>
<a id='line_2905'>which I never repent me, for thou falsely and cowardly slew his father</a>
<a id='line_2906'>Boudwin, traitorly for his good deeds; wherefore I pray Almighty Jesu</a>
<a id='line_2907'>send Alisander might and strength to be revenged upon thee. And now</a>
<a id='line_2908'>beware King Mark of young Alisander, for he is made a knight. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_2909'>said King Mark, that ever I should hear a traitor say so afore me. And</a>
<a id='line_2910'>therewith four knights of King Mark’s drew their swords to slay Sir</a>
<a id='line_2911'>Sadok, but anon Sir Sadok slew them all in King Mark’s presence. And</a>
<a id='line_2912'>then Sir Sadok passed forth into his chamber, and took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_2913'>his harness, and rode on his way a good pace. For there was neither Sir</a>
<a id='line_2914'>Tristram, neither Sir Dinas, nor Sir Fergus, that would Sir Sadok any</a>
<a id='line_2915'>evil will. Then was King Mark wroth, and thought to destroy Sir</a>
<a id='line_2916'>Alisander and Sir Sadok that had saved him; for King Mark dreaded and</a>
<a id='line_2917'>hated Alisander most of any man living.</a>
<a id='line_2918'></a>
<a id='line_2919'>When Sir Tristram understood that Alisander was made knight, anon</a>
<a id='line_2920'>forthwithal he sent him a letter, praying him and charging him that he</a>
<a id='line_2921'>would draw him to the court of King Arthur, and that he put him in the</a>
<a id='line_2922'>rule and in the hands of Sir Launcelot. So this letter was sent to</a>
<a id='line_2923'>Alisander from his cousin, Sir Tristram. And at that time he thought to</a>
<a id='line_2924'>do after his commandment. Then King Mark called a knight that brought</a>
<a id='line_2925'>him the tidings from Alisander, and bade him abide still in that</a>
<a id='line_2926'>country. Sir, said that knight, so must I do, for in my own country I</a>
<a id='line_2927'>dare not come. No force, said King Mark, I shall give thee here double</a>
<a id='line_2928'>as much lands as ever thou hadst of thine own. But within short space</a>
<a id='line_2929'>Sir Sadok met with that false knight, and slew him. Then was King Mark</a>
<a id='line_2930'>wood wroth out of measure. Then he sent unto Queen Morgan le Fay, and</a>
<a id='line_2931'>to the Queen of Northgalis, praying them in his letters that they two</a>
<a id='line_2932'>sorceresses would set all the country in fire with ladies that were</a>
<a id='line_2933'>enchantresses, and by such that were dangerous knights, as Malgrin,</a>
<a id='line_2934'>Breuse Saunce Pité, that by no mean Alisander le Orphelin should</a>
<a id='line_2935'>escape, but either he should be taken or slain. This ordinance made</a>
<a id='line_2936'>King Mark for to destroy Alisander.</a>
<a id='line_2937'></a>
<a id='line_2938'></a>
<a id='line_2939'></a>
<a id='line_2940'></a>
<a id='line_2941'>CHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Alisander won the prize at a tournament, and of</a>
<a id='line_2942'>Morgan le Fay: and how he fought with Sir Malgrin, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_2943'></a>
<a id='line_2944'></a>
<a id='line_2945'>Now turn we again unto Sir Alisander, that at his departing his mother</a>
<a id='line_2946'>took with him his father’s bloody shirt. So that he bare with him</a>
<a id='line_2947'>always till his death day, in tokening to think of his father’s death.</a>
<a id='line_2948'>So was Alisander purposed to ride to London, by the counsel of Sir</a>
<a id='line_2949'>Tristram, to Sir Launcelot. And by fortune he went by the seaside, and</a>
<a id='line_2950'>rode wrong. And there he won at a tournament the gree that King Carados</a>
<a id='line_2951'>made. And there he smote down King Carados and twenty of his knights,</a>
<a id='line_2952'>and also Sir Safere, a good knight that was Sir Palomides’ brother, the</a>
<a id='line_2953'>good knight. All this saw a damosel, and saw the best knight joust that</a>
<a id='line_2954'>ever she saw. And ever as he smote down knights he made them to swear</a>
<a id='line_2955'>to wear none harness in a twelvemonth and a day. This is well said,</a>
<a id='line_2956'>said Morgan le Fay, this is the knight that I would fain see. And so</a>
<a id='line_2957'>she took her palfrey, and rode a great while, and then she rested her</a>
<a id='line_2958'>in her pavilion. So there came four knights, two were armed, and two</a>
<a id='line_2959'>were unarmed, and they told Morgan le Fay their names: the first was</a>
<a id='line_2960'>Elias de Gomeret, the second was Cari de Gomeret, those were armed;</a>
<a id='line_2961'>that other twain were of Camiliard, cousins unto Queen Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_2962'>that one hight Guy, and that other hight Garaunt, those were unarmed.</a>
<a id='line_2963'>There these four knights told Morgan le Fay how a young knight had</a>
<a id='line_2964'>smitten them down before a castle. For the maiden of that castle said</a>
<a id='line_2965'>that he was but late made knight, and young. But as we suppose, but if</a>
<a id='line_2966'>it were Sir Tristram, or Sir Launcelot, or Sir Lamorak, the good</a>
<a id='line_2967'>knight, there is none that might sit him a buffet with a spear. Well,</a>
<a id='line_2968'>said Morgan le Fay, I shall meet that knight or it be long time, an he</a>
<a id='line_2969'>dwell in that country.</a>
<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>So turn we to the damosel of the castle, that when Alisander le</a>
<a id='line_2972'>Orphelin had forjousted the four knights, she called him to her, and</a>
<a id='line_2973'>said thus: Sir knight, wilt thou for my sake joust and fight with a</a>
<a id='line_2974'>knight, for my sake, of this country, that is and hath been long time</a>
<a id='line_2975'>an evil neighbour to me? His name is Malgrin, and he will not suffer me</a>
<a id='line_2976'>to be married in no manner wise for all that I can do, or any knight</a>
<a id='line_2977'>for my sake. Damosel, said Alisander, an he come whiles I am here I</a>
<a id='line_2978'>will fight with him, and my poor body for your sake I will jeopard. And</a>
<a id='line_2979'>therewithal she sent for him, for he was at her commandment. And when</a>
<a id='line_2980'>either had a sight of other, they made them ready for to joust, and</a>
<a id='line_2981'>they came together eagerly, and Malgrin brised his spear upon</a>
<a id='line_2982'>Alisander, and Alisander smote him again so hard that he bare him quite</a>
<a id='line_2983'>from his saddle to the earth. But this Malgrin arose lightly, and</a>
<a id='line_2984'>dressed his shield and drew his sword, and bade him alight, saying:</a>
<a id='line_2985'>Though thou have the better of me on horseback, thou shalt find that I</a>
<a id='line_2986'>shall endure like a knight on foot. It is well said, said Alisander;</a>
<a id='line_2987'>and so lightly he avoided his horse and betook him to his varlet. And</a>
<a id='line_2988'>then they rushed together like two boars, and laid on their helms and</a>
<a id='line_2989'>shields long time, by the space of three hours, that never man could</a>
<a id='line_2990'>say which was the better knight.</a>
<a id='line_2991'></a>
<a id='line_2992'>And in the meanwhile came Morgan le Fay to the damosel of the castle,</a>
<a id='line_2993'>and they beheld the battle. But this Malgrin was an old roted knight,</a>
<a id='line_2994'>and he was called one of the dangerous knights of the world to do</a>
<a id='line_2995'>battle on foot, but on horseback there were many better. And ever this</a>
<a id='line_2996'>Malgrin awaited to slay Alisander, and so wounded him wonderly sore,</a>
<a id='line_2997'>that it was marvel that ever he might stand, for he had bled so much</a>
<a id='line_2998'>blood; for Alisander fought wildly, and not wittily. And that other was</a>
<a id='line_2999'>a felonious knight, and awaited him, and smote him sore. And sometime</a>
<a id='line_3000'>they rushed together with their shields, like two boars or rams, and</a>
<a id='line_3001'>fell grovelling both to the earth. Now knight, said Malgrin, hold thy</a>
<a id='line_3002'>hand a while, and tell me what thou art. I will not, said Alisander,</a>
<a id='line_3003'>but if me list: but tell me thy name, and why thou keepest this</a>
<a id='line_3004'>country, or else thou shalt die of my hands. Wit thou well, said</a>
<a id='line_3005'>Malgrin, that for this maiden’s love, of this castle, I have slain ten</a>
<a id='line_3006'>good knights by mishap; and by outrage and orgulité of myself I have</a>
<a id='line_3007'>slain ten other knights. So God me help, said Alisander, this is the</a>
<a id='line_3008'>foulest confession that ever I heard knight make, nor never heard I</a>
<a id='line_3009'>speak of other men of such a shameful confession; wherefore it were</a>
<a id='line_3010'>great pity and great shame unto me that I should let thee live any</a>
<a id='line_3011'>longer; therefore keep thee as well as ever thou mayest, for as I am</a>
<a id='line_3012'>true knight, either thou shalt slay me or else I shall slay thee, I</a>
<a id='line_3013'>promise thee faithfully.</a>
<a id='line_3014'></a>
<a id='line_3015'>Then they lashed together fiercely, and at the last Alisander smote</a>
<a id='line_3016'>Malgrin to the earth. And then he raced off his helm, and smote off his</a>
<a id='line_3017'>head lightly. And when he had done and ended this battle, anon he</a>
<a id='line_3018'>called to him his varlet, the which brought him his horse. And then he,</a>
<a id='line_3019'>weening to be strong enough, would have mounted. And so she laid Sir</a>
<a id='line_3020'>Alisander in an horse litter, and led him into the castle, for he had</a>
<a id='line_3021'>no foot nor might to stand upon the earth; for he had sixteen great</a>
<a id='line_3022'>wounds, and in especial one of them was like to be his death.</a>
<a id='line_3023'></a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'></a>
<a id='line_3026'></a>
<a id='line_3027'>CHAPTER XXXVII. How Queen Morgan le Fay had Alisander in her castle,</a>
<a id='line_3028'>and how she healed his wounds.</a>
<a id='line_3029'></a>
<a id='line_3030'></a>
<a id='line_3031'>Then Queen Morgan le Fay searched his wounds, and gave such an ointment</a>
<a id='line_3032'>unto him that he should have died. And on the morn when she came to him</a>
<a id='line_3033'>he complained him sore; and then she put other ointments upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_3034'>then he was out of his pain. Then came the damosel of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_3035'>said unto Morgan le Fay: I pray you help me that this knight might wed</a>
<a id='line_3036'>me, for he hath won me with his hands. Ye shall see, said Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_3037'>Fay, what I shall say. Then Morgan le Fay went unto Alisander, and bade</a>
<a id='line_3038'>in anywise that he should refuse this lady, an she desire to wed you,</a>
<a id='line_3039'>for she is not for you. So the damosel came and desired of him</a>
<a id='line_3040'>marriage. Damosel, said Orphelin, I thank you, but as yet I cast me not</a>
<a id='line_3041'>to marry in this country. Sir, she said, sithen ye will not marry me, I</a>
<a id='line_3042'>pray you insomuch as ye have won me, that ye will give me to a knight</a>
<a id='line_3043'>of this country that hath been my friend, and loved me many years. With</a>
<a id='line_3044'>all my heart, said Alisander, I will assent thereto. Then was the</a>
<a id='line_3045'>knight sent for, his name was Gerine le Grose. And anon he made them</a>
<a id='line_3046'>handfast, and wedded them.</a>
<a id='line_3047'></a>
<a id='line_3048'>Then came Queen Morgan le Fay to Alisander, and bade him arise, and put</a>
<a id='line_3049'>him in an horse litter, and gave him such a drink that in three days</a>
<a id='line_3050'>and three nights he waked never, but slept; and so she brought him to</a>
<a id='line_3051'>her own castle that at that time was called La Beale Regard. Then</a>
<a id='line_3052'>Morgan le Fay came to Alisander, and asked him if he would fain be</a>
<a id='line_3053'>whole. Who would be sick, said Alisander, an he might be whole? Well,</a>
<a id='line_3054'>said Morgan le Fay, then shall ye promise me by your knighthood that</a>
<a id='line_3055'>this day twelvemonth and a day ye shall not pass the compass of this</a>
<a id='line_3056'>castle, and without doubt ye shall lightly be whole. I assent, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_3057'>Alisander. And there he made her a promise: then was he soon whole. And</a>
<a id='line_3058'>when Alisander was whole, then he repented him of his oath, for he</a>
<a id='line_3059'>might not be revenged upon King Mark. Right so there came a damosel</a>
<a id='line_3060'>that was cousin to the Earl of Pase, and she was cousin to Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_3061'>Fay. And by right that castle of La Beale Regard should have been hers</a>
<a id='line_3062'>by true inheritance. So this damosel entered into this castle where lay</a>
<a id='line_3063'>Alisander, and there she found him upon his bed, passing heavy and all</a>
<a id='line_3064'>sad.</a>
<a id='line_3065'></a>

<a id='line_3069'>CHAPTER XXXVIII. How Alisander was delivered from Queen Morgan le Fay</a>
<a id='line_3070'>by the means of a damosel.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'></a>
<a id='line_3073'>Sir knight, said the damosel, an ye would be merry I could tell you</a>
<a id='line_3074'>good tidings. Well were me, said Alisander, an I might hear of good</a>
<a id='line_3075'>tidings, for now I stand as a prisoner by my promise. Sir, she said,</a>
<a id='line_3076'>wit you well that ye be a prisoner, and worse than ye ween; for my</a>
<a id='line_3077'>lady, my cousin Queen Morgan le Fay, keepeth you here for none other</a>
<a id='line_3078'>intent but for to do her pleasure with you when it liketh her. O Jesu</a>
<a id='line_3079'>defend me, said Alisander, from such pleasure; for I had liefer cut</a>
<a id='line_3080'>away my hangers than I would do her such pleasure. As Jesu help me,</a>
<a id='line_3081'>said the damosel, an ye would love me and be ruled by me, I shall make</a>
<a id='line_3082'>your deliverance with your worship. Tell me, said Alisander, by what</a>
<a id='line_3083'>means, and ye shall have my love. Fair knight, said she, this castle of</a>
<a id='line_3084'>right ought to be mine, and I have an uncle the which is a mighty earl,</a>
<a id='line_3085'>he is Earl of Pase, and of all folks he hateth most Morgan le Fay; and</a>
<a id='line_3086'>I shall send unto him and pray him for my sake to destroy this castle</a>
<a id='line_3087'>for the evil customs that be used therein; and then will he come and</a>
<a id='line_3088'>set wild-fire on every part of the castle, and I shall get you out at a</a>
<a id='line_3089'>privy postern, and there shall ye have your horse and your harness. Ye</a>
<a id='line_3090'>say well, damosel, said Alisander. And then she said: Ye may keep the</a>
<a id='line_3091'>room of this castle this twelvemonth and a day, then break ye not your</a>
<a id='line_3092'>oath. Truly, fair damosel, said Alisander, ye say sooth. And then he</a>
<a id='line_3093'>kissed her, and did to her pleasaunce as it pleased them both at times</a>
<a id='line_3094'>and leisures.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>So anon she sent unto her uncle and bade him come and destroy that</a>
<a id='line_3097'>castle, for as the book saith, he would have destroyed that castle</a>
<a id='line_3098'>afore time had not that damosel been. When the earl understood her</a>
<a id='line_3099'>letters he sent her word again that on such a day he would come and</a>
<a id='line_3100'>destroy that castle. So when that day came she showed Alisander a</a>
<a id='line_3101'>postern wherethrough he should flee into a garden, and there he should</a>
<a id='line_3102'>find his armour and his horse. When the day came that was set, thither</a>
<a id='line_3103'>came the Earl of Pase with four hundred knights, and set on fire all</a>
<a id='line_3104'>the parts of the castle, that or they ceased they left not a stone</a>
<a id='line_3105'>standing. And all this while that the fire was in the castle he abode</a>
<a id='line_3106'>in the garden. And when the fire was done he let make a cry that he</a>
<a id='line_3107'>would keep that piece of earth thereas the castle of La Beale Regard</a>
<a id='line_3108'>was a twelvemonth and a day, from all manner knights that would come.</a>
<a id='line_3109'></a>
<a id='line_3110'>So it happed there was a duke that hight Ansirus, and he was of the kin</a>
<a id='line_3111'>of Sir Launcelot. And this knight was a great pilgrim, for every third</a>
<a id='line_3112'>year he would be at Jerusalem. And because he used all his life to go</a>
<a id='line_3113'>in pilgrimage men called him Duke Ansirus the Pilgrim. And this duke</a>
<a id='line_3114'>had a daughter that hight Alice, that was a passing fair woman, and</a>
<a id='line_3115'>because of her father she was called Alice la Beale Pilgrim. And anon</a>
<a id='line_3116'>as she heard of this cry she went unto Arthur’s court, and said openly</a>
<a id='line_3117'>in hearing of many knights, that what knight may overcome that knight</a>
<a id='line_3118'>that keepeth that piece of earth shall have me and all my lands.</a>
<a id='line_3119'></a>
<a id='line_3120'>When the knights of the Round Table heard her say thus many were glad,</a>
<a id='line_3121'>for she was passing fair and of great rents. Right so she let cry in</a>
<a id='line_3122'>castles and towns as fast on her side as Alisander did on his side.</a>
<a id='line_3123'>Then she dressed her pavilion straight by the piece of the earth that</a>
<a id='line_3124'>Alisander kept. So she was not so soon there but there came a knight of</a>
<a id='line_3125'>Arthur’s court that hight Sagramore le Desirous, and he proffered to</a>
<a id='line_3126'>joust with Alisander; and they encountered, and Sagramore le Desirous</a>
<a id='line_3127'>brised his spear upon Sir Alisander, but Sir Alisander smote him so</a>
<a id='line_3128'>hard that he avoided his saddle. And when La Beale Alice saw him joust</a>
<a id='line_3129'>so well, she thought him a passing goodly knight on horseback. And then</a>
<a id='line_3130'>she leapt out of her pavilion, and took Sir Alisander by the bridle,</a>
<a id='line_3131'>and thus she said: Fair knight, I require thee of thy knighthood show</a>
<a id='line_3132'>me thy visage. I dare well, said Alisander, show my visage. And then he</a>
<a id='line_3133'>put off his helm; and she saw his visage, she said: O sweet Jesu, thee</a>
<a id='line_3134'>I must love, and never other. Then show me your visage, said he.</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>

<a id='line_3139'>CHAPTER XXXIX. How Alisander met with Alice la Beale Pilgrim, and how</a>
<a id='line_3140'>he jousted with two knights; and after of him and of Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_3141'></a>
<a id='line_3142'></a>
<a id='line_3143'>Then she unwimpled her visage. And when he saw her he said: Here have I</a>
<a id='line_3144'>found my love and my lady. Truly, fair lady, said he, I promise you to</a>
<a id='line_3145'>be your knight, and none other that beareth the life. Now, gentle</a>
<a id='line_3146'>knight, said she, tell me your name. My name is, said he, Alisander le</a>
<a id='line_3147'>Orphelin. Now, damosel, tell me your name, said he. My name is, said</a>
<a id='line_3148'>she, Alice la Beale Pilgrim. And when we be more at our heart’s ease,</a>
<a id='line_3149'>both ye and I shall tell other of what blood we be come. So there was</a>
<a id='line_3150'>great love betwixt them. And as they thus talked there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_3151'>that hight Harsouse le Berbuse, and asked part of Sir Alisander’s</a>
<a id='line_3152'>spears. Then Sir Alisander encountered with him, and at the first Sir</a>
<a id='line_3153'>Alisander smote him over his horse’s croup. And then there came another</a>
<a id='line_3154'>knight that hight Sir Hewgon, and Sir Alisander smote him down as he</a>
<a id='line_3155'>did that other. Then Sir Hewgon proffered to do battle on foot. Sir</a>
<a id='line_3156'>Alisander overcame him with three strokes, and there would have slain</a>
<a id='line_3157'>him had he not yielded him. So then Alisander made both those knights</a>
<a id='line_3158'>to swear to wear none armour in a twelvemonth and a day.</a>
<a id='line_3159'></a>
<a id='line_3160'>Then Sir Alisander alighted down, and went to rest him and repose him.</a>
<a id='line_3161'>Then the damosel that helped Sir Alisander out of the castle, in her</a>
<a id='line_3162'>play told Alice all together how he was prisoner in the castle of La</a>
<a id='line_3163'>Beale Regard, and there she told her how she got him out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_3164'>Sir, said Alice la Beale Pilgrim, meseemeth ye are much beholding to</a>
<a id='line_3165'>this maiden. That is truth, said Sir Alisander. And there Alice told</a>
<a id='line_3166'>him of what blood she was come. Sir, wit ye well, she said, that I am</a>
<a id='line_3167'>of the blood of King Ban, that was father unto Sir Launcelot. Y-wis,</a>
<a id='line_3168'>fair lady, said Alisander, my mother told me that my father was brother</a>
<a id='line_3169'>unto a king, and I nigh cousin unto Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_3170'></a>
<a id='line_3171'>Then this while came there three knights, that one hight Vains, and the</a>
<a id='line_3172'>other hight Harvis de les Marches, and the third hight Perin de la</a>
<a id='line_3173'>Montaine. And with one spear Sir Alisander smote them down all three,</a>
<a id='line_3174'>and gave them such falls that they had no list to fight upon foot. So</a>
<a id='line_3175'>he made them to swear to wear none arms in a twelvemonth. So when they</a>
<a id='line_3176'>were departed Sir Alisander beheld his lady Alice on horseback as he</a>
<a id='line_3177'>stood in her pavilion. And then was he so enamoured upon her that he</a>
<a id='line_3178'>wist not whether he were on horseback or on foot.</a>
<a id='line_3179'></a>
<a id='line_3180'>Right so came the false knight Sir Mordred, and saw Sir Alisander was</a>
<a id='line_3181'>assotted upon his lady; and therewithal he took his horse by the</a>
<a id='line_3182'>bridle, and led him here and there, and had cast to have led him out of</a>
<a id='line_3183'>that place to have shamed him. When the damosel that helped him out of</a>
<a id='line_3184'>that castle saw how shamefully he was led, anon she let arm her, and</a>
<a id='line_3185'>set a shield upon her shoulder; and therewith she mounted upon his</a>
<a id='line_3186'>horse, and gat a naked sword in her hand, and she thrust unto Alisander</a>
<a id='line_3187'>with all her might, and she gave him such a buffet that he thought the</a>
<a id='line_3188'>fire flew out of his eyen. And when Alisander felt that stroke he</a>
<a id='line_3189'>looked about him, and drew his sword. And when she saw that, she fled,</a>
<a id='line_3190'>and so did Mordred into the forest, and the damosel fled into the</a>
<a id='line_3191'>pavilion. So when Alisander understood himself how the false knight</a>
<a id='line_3192'>would have shamed him had not the damosel been then was he wroth with</a>
<a id='line_3193'>himself that Sir Mordred was so escaped his hands. But then Sir</a>
<a id='line_3194'>Alisander and Alice had good game at the damosel, how sadly she hit him</a>
<a id='line_3195'>upon the helm.</a>
<a id='line_3196'></a>
<a id='line_3197'>Then Sir Alisander jousted thus day by day, and on foot he did many</a>
<a id='line_3198'>battles with many knights of King Arthur’s court, and with many knights</a>
<a id='line_3199'>strangers. Therefore to tell all the battles that he did it were</a>
<a id='line_3200'>overmuch to rehearse, for every day within that twelvemonth he had ado</a>
<a id='line_3201'>with one knight or with other, and some day he had ado with three or</a>
<a id='line_3202'>with four; and there was never knight that put him to the worse. And at</a>
<a id='line_3203'>the twelvemonth’s end he departed with his lady, Alice la Beale</a>
<a id='line_3204'>Pilgrim. And the damosel would never go from him, and so they went into</a>
<a id='line_3205'>their country of Benoye, and lived there in great joy.</a>
<a id='line_3206'></a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'></a>
<a id='line_3209'></a>
<a id='line_3210'>CHAPTER XL. How Sir Galahalt did do cry a jousts in Surluse, and Queen</a>
<a id='line_3211'>Guenever’s knights should joust against all that would come.</a>
<a id='line_3212'></a>
<a id='line_3213'></a>
<a id='line_3214'>But as the book saith, King Mark would never stint till he had slain</a>
<a id='line_3215'>him by treason. And by Alice he gat a child that hight Bellengerus le</a>
<a id='line_3216'>Beuse. And by good fortune he came to the court of King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_3217'>proved a passing good knight; and he revenged his father’s death, for</a>
<a id='line_3218'>the false King Mark slew both Sir Tristram and Alisander falsely and</a>
<a id='line_3219'>feloniously. And it happed so that Alisander had never grace nor</a>
<a id='line_3220'>fortune to come to King Arthur’s court. For an he had come to Sir</a>
<a id='line_3221'>Launcelot, all knights said that knew him, he was one of the strongest</a>
<a id='line_3222'>knights that was in Arthur’s days, and great dole was made for him. So</a>
<a id='line_3223'>let we of him pass, and turn we to another tale.</a>
<a id='line_3224'></a>
<a id='line_3225'>So it befell that Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was lord of the</a>
<a id='line_3226'>country of Surluse, whereof came many good knights. And this noble</a>
<a id='line_3227'>prince was a passing good man of arms, and ever he held a noble</a>
<a id='line_3228'>fellowship together. And then he came to Arthur’s court and told him</a>
<a id='line_3229'>his intent, how this was his will, how he would let cry a jousts in the</a>
<a id='line_3230'>country of Surluse, the which country was within the lands of King</a>
<a id='line_3231'>Arthur, and there he asked leave to let cry a jousts. I will give you</a>
<a id='line_3232'>leave, said King Arthur; but wit thou well, said King Arthur, I may not</a>
<a id='line_3233'>be there. Sir, said Queen Guenever, please it you to give me leave to</a>
<a id='line_3234'>be at that jousts. With right good will, said Arthur; for Sir Galahalt,</a>
<a id='line_3235'>the haut prince, shall have you in governance. Sir, said Galahalt, I</a>
<a id='line_3236'>will as ye will. Sir, then the queen, I will take with me [Sir</a>
<a id='line_3237'>Launcelot] and such knights as please me best. Do as ye list, said King</a>
<a id='line_3238'>Arthur. So anon she commanded Sir Launcelot to make him ready with such</a>
<a id='line_3239'>knights as he thought best.</a>
<a id='line_3240'></a>
<a id='line_3241'>So in every good town and castle of this land was made a cry, that in</a>
<a id='line_3242'>the country of Surluse Sir Galahalt should make a joust that should</a>
<a id='line_3243'>last eight days, and how the haut prince, with the help of Queen</a>
<a id='line_3244'>Guenever’s knights, should joust against all manner of men that would</a>
<a id='line_3245'>come. When this cry was known, kings and princes, dukes and earls,</a>
<a id='line_3246'>barons and noble knights, made them ready to be at that jousts. And at</a>
<a id='line_3247'>the day of jousting there came in Sir Dinadan disguised, and did many</a>
<a id='line_3248'>great deeds of arms.</a>
<a id='line_3249'></a>
<a id='line_3250'></a>
<a id='line_3251'></a>
<a id='line_3252'></a>
<a id='line_3253'>CHAPTER XLI. How Sir Launcelot fought in the tournament, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_3254'>Palomides did arms there for a damosel.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'></a>
<a id='line_3257'>Then at the request of Queen Guenever and of King Bagdemagus Sir</a>
<a id='line_3258'>Launcelot came into the range, but he was disguised, and that was the</a>
<a id='line_3259'>cause that few folk knew him; and there met with him Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_3260'>Maris, his own brother, and either brake their spears upon other to</a>
<a id='line_3261'>their hands. And then either gat another spear. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_3262'>smote down Sir Ector de Maris, his own brother. That saw Sir Bleoberis,</a>
<a id='line_3263'>and he smote Sir Launcelot such a buffet upon the helm that he wist not</a>
<a id='line_3264'>well where he was. Then Sir Launcelot was wrothy and smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_3265'>Bleoberis so sore upon the helm that his head bowed down backward. And</a>
<a id='line_3266'>he smote eft another buffet, that he avoided his saddle; and so he rode</a>
<a id='line_3267'>by, and thrust forth to the thickest. When the King of Northgalis saw</a>
<a id='line_3268'>Sir Ector and Bleoberis lie on the ground then was he wroth, for they</a>
<a id='line_3269'>came on his party against them of Surluse. So the King of Northgalis</a>
<a id='line_3270'>ran to Sir Launcelot, and brake a spear upon him all to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_3271'>Therewith Sir Launcelot overtook the King of Northgalis, and smote him</a>
<a id='line_3272'>such a buffet on the helm with his sword that he made him to avoid his</a>
<a id='line_3273'>horse; and anon the king was horsed again. So both the King Bagdemagus’</a>
<a id='line_3274'>and the King of Northgalis’ party hurled to other; and then began a</a>
<a id='line_3275'>strong medley, but they of Northgalis were far bigger.</a>
<a id='line_3276'></a>
<a id='line_3277'>When Sir Launcelot saw his party go to the worst he thrang into the</a>
<a id='line_3278'>thickest press with a sword in his hand; and there he smote down on the</a>
<a id='line_3279'>right hand and on the left hand, and pulled down knights and raced off</a>
<a id='line_3280'>their helms, that all men had wonder that ever one knight might do such</a>
<a id='line_3281'>deeds of arms. When Sir Meliagaunce, that was son unto King Bagdemagus,</a>
<a id='line_3282'>saw how Sir Launcelot fared he marvelled greatly. And when he</a>
<a id='line_3283'>understood that it was he, he wist well that he was disguised for his</a>
<a id='line_3284'>sake. Then Sir Meliagaunce prayed a knight to slay Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_3285'>horse, either with sword or with spear. At that time King Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_3286'>met with a knight that hight Sauseise, a good knight, to whom he said:</a>
<a id='line_3287'>Now fair Sauseise, encounter with my son Meliagaunce and give him large</a>
<a id='line_3288'>payment, for I would he were well beaten of thy hands, that he might</a>
<a id='line_3289'>depart out of this field. And then Sir Sauseise encountered with Sir</a>
<a id='line_3290'>Meliagaunce, and either smote other down. And then they fought on foot,</a>
<a id='line_3291'>and there Sauseise had won Sir Meliagaunce, had there not come rescues.</a>
<a id='line_3292'>So then the haut prince blew to lodging, and every knight unarmed him</a>
<a id='line_3293'>and went to the great feast.</a>
<a id='line_3294'></a>
<a id='line_3295'>Then in the meanwhile there came a damosel to the haut prince, and</a>
<a id='line_3296'>complained that there was a knight that hight Goneries that withheld</a>
<a id='line_3297'>her all her lands. Then the knight was there present, and cast his</a>
<a id='line_3298'>glove to her or to any that would fight in her name. So the damosel</a>
<a id='line_3299'>took up the glove all heavily for default of a champion. Then there</a>
<a id='line_3300'>came a varlet to her and said: Damosel, will ye do after me? Full fain,</a>
<a id='line_3301'>said the damosel. Then go you unto such a knight that lieth here beside</a>
<a id='line_3302'>in an hermitage, and that followeth the Questing Beast, and pray him to</a>
<a id='line_3303'>take the battle upon him, and anon I wot well he will grant you.</a>
<a id='line_3304'></a>
<a id='line_3305'>So anon she took her palfrey, and within a while she found that knight,</a>
<a id='line_3306'>that was Sir Palomides. And when she required him he armed him and rode</a>
<a id='line_3307'>with her, and made her to go to the haut prince, and to ask leave for</a>
<a id='line_3308'>her knight to do battle. I will well, said the haut prince. Then the</a>
<a id='line_3309'>knights were ready in the field to joust on horseback; and either gat a</a>
<a id='line_3310'>spear in their hands, and met so fiercely together that their spears</a>
<a id='line_3311'>all to-shivered. Then they flang out swords, and Sir Palomides smote</a>
<a id='line_3312'>Sir Goneries down to the earth. And then he raced off his helm and</a>
<a id='line_3313'>smote off his head. Then they went to supper, and the damosel loved</a>
<a id='line_3314'>Palomides as paramour, but the book saith she was of his kin. So then</a>
<a id='line_3315'>Palomides disguised himself in this manner, in his shield he bare the</a>
<a id='line_3316'>Questing Beast, and in all his trappings. And when he was thus ready,</a>
<a id='line_3317'>he sent to the haut prince to give him leave to joust with other</a>
<a id='line_3318'>knights, but he was adoubted of Sir Launcelot. The haut prince sent him</a>
<a id='line_3319'>word again that he should be welcome, and that Sir Launcelot should not</a>
<a id='line_3320'>joust with him. Then Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, let cry what knight</a>
<a id='line_3321'>somever he were that smote down Sir Palomides should have his damosel</a>
<a id='line_3322'>to himself.</a>
<a id='line_3323'></a>
<a id='line_3324'></a>
<a id='line_3325'></a>
<a id='line_3326'></a>
<a id='line_3327'>CHAPTER XLII. How Sir Galahalt and Palomides fought together, and of</a>
<a id='line_3328'>Sir Dinadan and Sir Galahalt.</a>
<a id='line_3329'></a>
<a id='line_3330'></a>
<a id='line_3331'>Here beginneth the second day. Anon as Sir Palomides came into the</a>
<a id='line_3332'>field, Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was at the range end, and met</a>
<a id='line_3333'>with Sir Palomides, and he with him, with great spears. And then they</a>
<a id='line_3334'>came so hard together that their spears all to-shivered, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_3335'>Galahalt smote him so hard that he bare him backward over his horse,</a>
<a id='line_3336'>but yet he lost not his stirrups. Then they drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_3337'>lashed together many sad strokes, that many worshipful knights left</a>
<a id='line_3338'>their business to behold them. But at the last Sir Galahalt, the haut</a>
<a id='line_3339'>prince, smote a stroke of might unto Palomides, sore upon the helm; but</a>
<a id='line_3340'>the helm was so hard that the sword might not bite, but slipped and</a>
<a id='line_3341'>smote off the head of the horse of Sir Palomides. When the haut prince</a>
<a id='line_3342'>wist and saw the good knight fall unto the earth he was ashamed of that</a>
<a id='line_3343'>stroke. And therewith he alighted down off his own horse, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_3344'>the good knight, Palomides, to take that horse of his gift, and to</a>
<a id='line_3345'>forgive him that deed. Sir, said Palomides, I thank you of your great</a>
<a id='line_3346'>goodness, for ever of a man of worship a knight shall never have</a>
<a id='line_3347'>disworship; and so he mounted upon that horse, and the haut prince had</a>
<a id='line_3348'>another anon. Now, said the haut prince, I release to you that maiden,</a>
<a id='line_3349'>for ye have won her. Ah, said Palomides, the damosel and I be at your</a>
<a id='line_3350'>commandment.</a>
<a id='line_3351'></a>
<a id='line_3352'>So they departed, and Sir Galahalt did great deeds of arms. And right</a>
<a id='line_3353'>so came Dinadan and encountered with Sir Galahalt, and either came to</a>
<a id='line_3354'>other so fast with their spears that their spears brake to their hands.</a>
<a id='line_3355'>But Dinadan had weened the haut prince had been more weary than he was.</a>
<a id='line_3356'>And then he smote many sad strokes at the haut prince; but when Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_3357'>saw he might not get him to the earth he said: My lord, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_3358'>leave me, and take another. The haut prince knew not Dinadan, and left</a>
<a id='line_3359'>goodly for his fair words. And so they departed; but soon there came</a>
<a id='line_3360'>another and told the haut prince that it was Dinadan. Forsooth, said</a>
<a id='line_3361'>the prince, therefore am I heavy that he is so escaped from me, for</a>
<a id='line_3362'>with his mocks and japes now shall I never have done with him. And then</a>
<a id='line_3363'>Galahalt rode fast after him, and bade him: Abide, Dinadan, for King</a>
<a id='line_3364'>Arthur’s sake. Nay, said Dinadan, so God me help, we meet no more</a>
<a id='line_3365'>together this day. Then in that wrath the haut prince met with</a>
<a id='line_3366'>Meliagaunce, and he smote him in the throat that an he had fallen his</a>
<a id='line_3367'>neck had broken; and with the same spear he smote down another knight.</a>
<a id='line_3368'>Then came in they of Northgalis and many strangers, and were like to</a>
<a id='line_3369'>have put them of Surluse to the worse, for Sir Galahalt, the haut</a>
<a id='line_3370'>prince, had ever much in hand. So there came the good knight, Semound</a>
<a id='line_3371'>the Valiant, with forty knights, and he beat them all aback. Then the</a>
<a id='line_3372'>Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot let blow to lodging, and every knight</a>
<a id='line_3373'>unarmed him, and dressed him to the feast.</a>
<a id='line_3374'></a>

<a id='line_3378'>CHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Archade appealed Sir Palomides of treason, and</a>
<a id='line_3379'>how Sir Palomides slew him.</a>
<a id='line_3380'></a>
<a id='line_3381'></a>
<a id='line_3382'>When Palomides was unarmed he asked lodging for himself and the</a>
<a id='line_3383'>damosel. Anon the haut prince commanded them to lodging. And he was not</a>
<a id='line_3384'>so soon in his lodging but there came a knight that hight Archade, he</a>
<a id='line_3385'>was brother unto Goneries that Palomides slew afore in the damosel’s</a>
<a id='line_3386'>quarrel. And this knight, Archade, called Sir Palomides traitor, and</a>
<a id='line_3387'>appealed him for the death of his brother. By the leave of the haut</a>
<a id='line_3388'>prince, said Palomides, I shall answer thee. When Sir Galahalt</a>
<a id='line_3389'>understood their quarrel he bade them go to dinner: And as soon as ye</a>
<a id='line_3390'>have dined look that either knight be ready in the field. So when they</a>
<a id='line_3391'>had dined they were armed both, and took their horses, and the queen,</a>
<a id='line_3392'>and the prince, and Sir Launcelot, were set to behold them; and so they</a>
<a id='line_3393'>let run their horses, and there Sir Palomides bare Archade on his spear</a>
<a id='line_3394'>over his horse’s tail. And then Palomides alighted and drew his sword,</a>
<a id='line_3395'>but Sir Archade might not arise; and there Sir Palomides raced off his</a>
<a id='line_3396'>helm, and smote off his head. Then the haut prince and Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_3397'>went unto supper. Then King Bagdemagus sent away his son Meliagaunce</a>
<a id='line_3398'>because Sir Launcelot should not meet with him, for he hated Sir</a>
<a id='line_3399'>Launcelot, and that knew he not.</a>

<a id='line_3405'>Lamorak, and other things.</a>
<a id='line_3406'></a>
<a id='line_3407'></a>
<a id='line_3408'>Now beginneth the third day of jousting; and at that day King</a>
<a id='line_3409'>Bagdemagus made him ready; and there came against him King Marsil, that</a>
<a id='line_3410'>had in gift an island of Sir Galahalt the haut prince; and this island</a>
<a id='line_3411'>had the name Pomitain. Then it befell that King Bagdemagus and King</a>
<a id='line_3412'>Marsil of Pomitain met together with spears, and King Marsil had such a</a>
<a id='line_3413'>buffet that he fell over his horse’s croup. Then came there in a knight</a>
<a id='line_3414'>of King Marsil to revenge his lord, and King Bagdemagus smote him down,</a>
<a id='line_3415'>horse and man, to the earth. So there came an earl that hight Arrouse,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>and Sir Breuse, and an hundred knights with them of Pomitain, and the</a>
<a id='line_3417'>King of Northgalis was with them; and all these were against them of</a>
<a id='line_3418'>Surluse. And then there began great battle, and many knights were cast</a>
<a id='line_3419'>under horses’ feet. And ever King Bagdemagus did best, for he first</a>
<a id='line_3420'>began, and ever he held on. Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, smote ever at</a>
<a id='line_3421'>the face of King Bagdemagus; and at the last King Bagdemagus hurtled</a>
<a id='line_3422'>down Gaheris, horse and man.</a>
<a id='line_3423'></a>
<a id='line_3424'>Then by adventure Sir Palomides, the good knight, met with Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_3425'>de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis’ brother. And either smote other with great</a>
<a id='line_3426'>spears, that both their horses and knights fell to the earth. But Sir</a>
<a id='line_3427'>Blamore had such a fall that he had almost broken his neck, for the</a>
<a id='line_3428'>blood brast out at nose, mouth, and his ears, but at the last he</a>
<a id='line_3429'>recovered well by good surgeons. Then there came in the Duke Chaleins</a>
<a id='line_3430'>of Clarance; and in his governance there came a knight that hight Elis</a>
<a id='line_3431'>la Noire; and there encountered with him King Bagdemagus, and he smote</a>
<a id='line_3432'>Elis that he made him to avoid his saddle. So the Duke Chaleins of</a>
<a id='line_3433'>Clarance did there great deeds of arms, and of so late as he came in</a>
<a id='line_3434'>the third day there was no man did so well except King Bagdemagus and</a>
<a id='line_3435'>Sir Palomides, that the prize was given that day to King Bagdemagus.</a>
<a id='line_3436'>And then they blew unto lodging, and unarmed them, and went to the</a>
<a id='line_3437'>feast. Right so came Dinadan, and mocked and japed with King Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_3438'>that all knights laughed at him, for he was a fine japer, and well</a>
<a id='line_3439'>loving all good knights.</a>
<a id='line_3440'></a>
<a id='line_3441'>So anon as they had dined there came a varlet bearing four spears on</a>
<a id='line_3442'>his back; and he came to Palomides, and said thus: Here is a knight by</a>
<a id='line_3443'>hath sent you the choice of four spears, and requireth you for your</a>
<a id='line_3444'>lady’s sake to take that one half of these spears, and joust with him</a>
<a id='line_3445'>in the field. Tell him, said Palomides, I will not fail him. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_3446'>Galahalt wist of this, he bade Palomides make him ready. So the Queen</a>
<a id='line_3447'>Guenever, the haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, they were set upon</a>
<a id='line_3448'>scaffolds to give the judgment of these two knights. Then Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_3449'>and the strange knight ran so eagerly together that their spears brake</a>
<a id='line_3450'>to their hands. Anon withal either of them took a great spear in his</a>
<a id='line_3451'>hand and all to-shivered them in pieces. And then either took a greater</a>
<a id='line_3452'>spear, and then the knight smote down Sir Palomides, horse and man, to</a>
<a id='line_3453'>the earth. And as he would have passed over him the strange knight’s</a>
<a id='line_3454'>horse stumbled and fell down upon Palomides. Then they drew their</a>
<a id='line_3455'>swords and lashed together wonderly sore a great while.</a>
<a id='line_3456'></a>
<a id='line_3457'>Then the haut prince and Sir Launcelot said they saw never two knights</a>
<a id='line_3458'>fight better than they did; but ever the strange knight doubled his</a>
<a id='line_3459'>strokes, and put Palomides aback; therewithal the haut prince cried:</a>
<a id='line_3460'>Ho: and then they went to lodging. And when they were unarmed they knew</a>
<a id='line_3461'>it was the noble knight Sir Lamorak. When Sir Launcelot knew that it</a>
<a id='line_3462'>was Sir Lamorak he made much of him, for above all earthly men he loved</a>
<a id='line_3463'>him best except Sir Tristram. Then Queen Guenever commended him, and so</a>
<a id='line_3464'>did all other good knights make much of him, except Sir Gawaine’s</a>
<a id='line_3465'>brethren. Then Queen Guenever said unto Sir Launcelot: Sir, I require</a>
<a id='line_3466'>you that an ye joust any more, that ye joust with none of the blood of</a>
<a id='line_3467'>my lord Arthur. So he promised he would not as at that time.</a>
<a id='line_3468'></a>
<a id='line_3469'></a>
<a id='line_3470'></a>
<a id='line_3471'></a>
<a id='line_3472'>CHAPTER XLV. Of the fourth day, and of many great feats of arms.</a>
<a id='line_3473'></a>
<a id='line_3474'></a>
<a id='line_3475'>Here beginneth the fourth day. Then came into the field the King with</a>
<a id='line_3476'>the Hundred Knights, and all they of Northgalis, and the Duke Chaleins</a>
<a id='line_3477'>of Clarance, and King Marsil of Pomitain, and there came Safere,</a>
<a id='line_3478'>Palomides’ brother, and there he told him tidings of his mother. And</a>
<a id='line_3479'>his name was called the Earl, and so he appealed him afore King Arthur:</a>
<a id='line_3480'>For he made war upon our father and mother, and there I slew him in</a>
<a id='line_3481'>plain battle. So they went into the field, and the damosel with them;</a>
<a id='line_3482'>and there came to encounter again them Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_3483'>Ector de Maris. Sir Palomides encountered with Sir Bleoberis, and</a>
<a id='line_3484'>either smote other down. And in the same wise did Sir Safere and Sir</a>
<a id='line_3485'>Ector, and the two couples did battle on foot. Then came in Sir</a>
<a id='line_3486'>Lamorak, and he encountered with the King with the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_3487'>smote him quite over his horse’s tail. And in the same wise he served</a>
<a id='line_3488'>the King of Northgalis, and also he smote down King Marsil. And so or</a>
<a id='line_3489'>ever he stint he smote down with his spear and with his sword thirty</a>
<a id='line_3490'>knights. When Duke Chaleins saw Lamorak do so great prowess he would</a>
<a id='line_3491'>not meddle with him for shame; and then he charged all his knights in</a>
<a id='line_3492'>pain of death that none of you touch him; for it were shame to all good</a>
<a id='line_3493'>knights an that knight were shamed.</a>
<a id='line_3494'></a>
<a id='line_3495'>Then the two kings gathered them together, and all they set upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_3496'>Lamorak; and he failed them not, but rushed here and there, smiting on</a>
<a id='line_3497'>the right hand and on the left, and raced off many helms, so that the</a>
<a id='line_3498'>haut prince and Queen Guenever said they saw never knight do such deeds</a>
<a id='line_3499'>of arms on horseback. Alas, said Launcelot to King Bagdemagus, I will</a>
<a id='line_3500'>arm me and help Sir Lamorak. And I will ride with you, said King</a>
<a id='line_3501'>Bagdemagus. And when they two were horsed they came to Sir Lamorak that</a>
<a id='line_3502'>stood among thirty knights; and well was him that might reach him a</a>
<a id='line_3503'>buffet, and ever he smote again mightily. Then came there into the</a>
<a id='line_3504'>press Sir Launcelot, and he threw down Sir Mador de la Porte. And with</a>
<a id='line_3505'>the truncheon of that spear he threw down many knights. And King</a>
<a id='line_3506'>Bagdemagus smote on the left hand and on the right hand marvellously</a>
<a id='line_3507'>well. And then the three kings fled aback. Therewithal then Sir</a>
<a id='line_3508'>Galahalt let blow to lodging, and all the heralds gave Sir Lamorak the</a>
<a id='line_3509'>prize. And all this while fought Palomides, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Safere,</a>
<a id='line_3510'>Sir Ector on foot; never were there four knights evener matched. And</a>
<a id='line_3511'>then they were departed, and had unto their lodging, and unarmed them,</a>
<a id='line_3512'>and so they went to the great feast.</a>
<a id='line_3513'></a>
<a id='line_3514'>But when Sir Lamorak was come into the court Queen Guenever took him in</a>
<a id='line_3515'>her arms and said: Sir, well have ye done this day. Then came the haut</a>
<a id='line_3516'>prince, and he made of him great joy, and so did Dinadan, for he wept</a>
<a id='line_3517'>for joy; but the joy that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Lamorak there might</a>
<a id='line_3518'>no man tell. Then they went unto rest, and on the morn the haut prince</a>
<a id='line_3519'>let blow unto the field.</a>
<a id='line_3520'></a>
<a id='line_3521'></a>
<a id='line_3522'></a>
<a id='line_3523'></a>
<a id='line_3524'>CHAPTER XLVI. Of the Fifth day, and how Sir Lamorak behaved him.</a>
<a id='line_3525'></a>
<a id='line_3526'></a>
<a id='line_3527'>Here beginneth the fifth day. So it befell that Sir Palomides came in</a>
<a id='line_3528'>the morntide, and proffered to joust thereas King Arthur was in a</a>
<a id='line_3529'>castle there besides Surluse; and there encountered with him a</a>
<a id='line_3530'>worshipful duke, and there Sir Palomides smote him over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_3531'>croup. And this duke was uncle unto King Arthur. Then Sir Elise’s son</a>
<a id='line_3532'>rode unto Palomides, and Palomides served Elise in the same wise. When</a>
<a id='line_3533'>Sir Uwaine saw this he was wroth. Then he took his horse and</a>
<a id='line_3534'>encountered with Sir Palomides, and Palomides smote him so hard that he</a>
<a id='line_3535'>went to the earth, horse and man. And for to make a short tale, he</a>
<a id='line_3536'>smote down three brethren of Sir Gawaine, that is for to say Mordred,</a>
<a id='line_3537'>Gaheris, and Agravaine. O Jesu, said Arthur, this is a great despite of</a>
<a id='line_3538'>a Saracen that he shall smite down my blood. And therewithal King</a>
<a id='line_3539'>Arthur was wood wroth, and thought to have made him ready to joust.</a>
<a id='line_3540'></a>
<a id='line_3541'>That espied Sir Lamorak, that Arthur and his blood were discomfit; and</a>
<a id='line_3542'>anon he was ready, and asked Palomides if he would any more joust. Why</a>
<a id='line_3543'>should I not? said Palomides. Then they hurtled together, and brake</a>
<a id='line_3544'>their spears, and all to-shivered them, that all the castle rang of</a>
<a id='line_3545'>their dints. Then either gat a greater spear in his hand, and they came</a>
<a id='line_3546'>so fiercely together; but Sir Palomides’ spear all to-brast and Sir</a>
<a id='line_3547'>Lamorak’s did hold. Therewithal Sir Palomides lost his stirrups and lay</a>
<a id='line_3548'>upright on his horse’s back. And then Sir Palomides returned again and</a>
<a id='line_3549'>took his damosel, and Sir Safere returned his way.</a>
<a id='line_3550'></a>
<a id='line_3551'>So, when he was departed, King Arthur came to Sir Lamorak and thanked</a>
<a id='line_3552'>him of his goodness, and prayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_3553'>Lamorak, wit thou well, I owe you my service, but as at this time I</a>
<a id='line_3554'>will not abide here, for I see of mine enemies many about me. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_3555'>said Arthur, now wot I well it is Sir Lamorak de Galis. O Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_3556'>abide with me, and by my crown I shall never fail thee: and not so</a>
<a id='line_3557'>hardy in Gawaine’s head, nor none of his brethren, to do thee any</a>
<a id='line_3558'>wrong. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, wrong have they done me, and to you both.</a>
<a id='line_3559'>That is truth, said the king, for they slew their own mother and my</a>
<a id='line_3560'>sister, the which me sore grieveth: it had been much fairer and better</a>
<a id='line_3561'>that ye had wedded her, for ye are a king’s son as well as they. O</a>
<a id='line_3562'>Jesu, said the noble knight Sir Lamorak unto Arthur, her death shall I</a>
<a id='line_3563'>never forget. I promise you, and make mine avow unto God, I shall</a>
<a id='line_3564'>revenge her death as soon as I see time convenable. And if it were not</a>
<a id='line_3565'>at the reverence of your highness I should now have been revenged upon</a>
<a id='line_3566'>Sir Gawaine and his brethren. Truly, said Arthur, I will make you at</a>
<a id='line_3567'>accord. Sir, said Lamorak, as at this time I may not abide with you,</a>
<a id='line_3568'>for I must to the jousts, where is Sir Launcelot, and the haut prince</a>
<a id='line_3569'>Sir Galahalt.</a>
<a id='line_3570'></a>
<a id='line_3571'>Then there was a damosel that was daughter to King Bandes. And there</a>
<a id='line_3572'>was a Saracen knight that hight Corsabrin, and he loved the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_3573'>and in no wise he would suffer her to be married; for ever this</a>
<a id='line_3574'>Corsabrin noised her, and named her that she was out of her mind; and</a>
<a id='line_3575'>thus he let her that she might not be married.</a>
<a id='line_3576'></a>
<a id='line_3577'></a>
<a id='line_3578'></a>
<a id='line_3579'></a>
<a id='line_3580'>CHAPTER XLVII. How Sir Palomides fought with Corsabrin for a lady, and</a>
<a id='line_3581'>how Palomides slew Corsabrin.</a>
<a id='line_3582'></a>
<a id='line_3583'></a>
<a id='line_3584'>So by fortune this damosel heard tell that Palomides did much for</a>
<a id='line_3585'>damosels’ sake; so she sent to him a pensel, and prayed him to fight</a>
<a id='line_3586'>with Sir Corsabrin for her love, and he should have her and her lands</a>
<a id='line_3587'>of her father’s that should fall to her. Then the damosel sent unto</a>
<a id='line_3588'>Corsabrin, and bade him go unto Sir Palomides that was a paynim as well</a>
<a id='line_3589'>as he, and she gave him warning that she had sent him her pensel, and</a>
<a id='line_3590'>if he might overcome Palomides she would wed him. When Corsabrin wist</a>
<a id='line_3591'>of her deeds then was he wood wroth and angry, and rode unto Surluse</a>
<a id='line_3592'>where the haut prince was, and there he found Sir Palomides ready, the</a>
<a id='line_3593'>which had the pensel. So there they waged battle either with other</a>
<a id='line_3594'>afore Galahalt. Well, said the haut prince, this day must noble knights</a>
<a id='line_3595'>joust, and at-after dinner we shall see how ye can speed.</a>
<a id='line_3596'></a>
<a id='line_3597'>Then they blew to jousts; and in came Dinadan, and met with Sir Gerin,</a>
<a id='line_3598'>a good knight, and he threw him down over his horse’s croup; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_3599'>Dinadan overthrew four knights more; and there he did great deeds of</a>
<a id='line_3600'>arms, for he was a good knight, but he was a scoffer and a japer, and</a>
<a id='line_3601'>the merriest knight among fellowship that was that time living. And he</a>
<a id='line_3602'>had such a custom that he loved every good knight, and every good</a>
<a id='line_3603'>knight loved him again. So then when the haut prince saw Dinadan do so</a>
<a id='line_3604'>well, he sent unto Sir Launcelot and bade him strike down Sir Dinadan:</a>
<a id='line_3605'>And when that ye have done so bring him afore me and the noble Queen</a>
<a id='line_3606'>Guenever. Then Sir Launcelot did as he was required. Then Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_3607'>and he smote down many knights, and raced off helms, and drove all the</a>
<a id='line_3608'>knights afore them. And so Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Dinadan, and</a>
<a id='line_3609'>made his men to unarm him, and so brought him to the queen and the haut</a>
<a id='line_3610'>prince, and they laughed at Dinadan so sore that they might not stand.</a>
<a id='line_3611'>Well, said Sir Dinadan, yet have I no shame, for the old shrew, Sir</a>
<a id='line_3612'>Launcelot, smote me down. So they went to dinner, [and] all the court</a>
<a id='line_3613'>had good sport at Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_3614'></a>
<a id='line_3615'>Then when the dinner was done they blew to the field to behold Sir</a>
<a id='line_3616'>Palomides and Corsabrin. Sir Palomides pight his pensel in midst of the</a>
<a id='line_3617'>field; and then they hurtled together with their spears as it were</a>
<a id='line_3618'>thunder, and either smote other to the earth. And then they pulled out</a>
<a id='line_3619'>their swords, and dressed their shields, and lashed together mightily</a>
<a id='line_3620'>as mighty knights, that well-nigh there was no piece of harness would</a>
<a id='line_3621'>hold them, for this Corsabrin was a passing felonious knight.</a>
<a id='line_3622'>Corsabrin, said Palomides, wilt thou release me yonder damosel and the</a>
<a id='line_3623'>pensel? Then was Corsabrin wroth out of measure, and gave Palomides</a>
<a id='line_3624'>such a buffet that he kneeled on his knee. Then Palomides arose</a>
<a id='line_3625'>lightly, and smote him upon the helm that he fell down right to the</a>
<a id='line_3626'>earth. And therewith he raced off his helm and said: Corsabrin, yield</a>
<a id='line_3627'>thee or else thou shalt die of my hands. Fie on thee, said Corsabrin,</a>
<a id='line_3628'>do thy worst. Then he smote off his head. And therewithal came a stink</a>
<a id='line_3629'>of his body when the soul departed, that there might nobody abide the</a>
<a id='line_3630'>savour. So was the corpse had away and buried in a wood, because he was</a>
<a id='line_3631'>a paynim. Then they blew unto lodging, and Palomides was unarmed.</a>
<a id='line_3632'></a>
<a id='line_3633'>Then he went unto Queen Guenever, to the haut prince, and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_3634'>Launcelot. Sir, said the haut prince, here have ye seen this day a</a>
<a id='line_3635'>great miracle by Corsabrin, what savour there was when the soul</a>
<a id='line_3636'>departed from the body. Therefore, sir, we will require you to take the</a>
<a id='line_3637'>baptism upon you, and I promise you all knights will set the more by</a>
<a id='line_3638'>you, and say more worship by you. Sir, said Palomides, I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_3639'>all know that into this land I came to be christened, and in my heart I</a>
<a id='line_3640'>am christened and christened will I be. But I have made such an avow</a>
<a id='line_3641'>that I may not be christened till I have done seven true battles for</a>
<a id='line_3642'>Jesu’s sake, and then will I be christened; and I trust God will take</a>
<a id='line_3643'>mine intent, for I mean truly. Then Sir Palomides prayed Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_3644'>and the haut prince to sup with him. And so they did, both Sir</a>
<a id='line_3645'>Launcelot and Sir Lamorak, and many other good knights. So on the morn</a>
<a id='line_3646'>they heard their mass, and blew the field, and then knights made them</a>
<a id='line_3647'>ready.</a>
<a id='line_3648'></a>
<a id='line_3649'></a>
<a id='line_3650'></a>
<a id='line_3651'></a>
<a id='line_3652'>CHAPTER XLVIII. Of the sixth day, and what then was done.</a>
<a id='line_3653'></a>
<a id='line_3654'></a>
<a id='line_3655'>Here beginneth the sixth day. Then came therein Sir Gaheris, and there</a>
<a id='line_3656'>encountered with him Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and Sir Gaheris smote him</a>
<a id='line_3657'>over his horse’s croup. And then either party encountered with other,</a>
<a id='line_3658'>and there were many spears broken, and many knights cast under feet. So</a>
<a id='line_3659'>there came in Sir Dornard and Sir Aglovale, that were brethren unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_3660'>Lamorak, and they met with other two knights, and either smote other so</a>
<a id='line_3661'>hard that all four knights and horses fell to the earth. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_3662'>Lamorak saw his two brethren down he was wroth out of measure, and then</a>
<a id='line_3663'>he gat a great spear in his hand, and therewithal he smote down four</a>
<a id='line_3664'>good knights, and then his spear brake. Then he pulled out his sword,</a>
<a id='line_3665'>and smote about him on the right hand and on the left hand, and raced</a>
<a id='line_3666'>off helms and pulled down knights, that all men marvelled of such deeds</a>
<a id='line_3667'>of arms as he did, for he fared so that many knights fled. Then he</a>
<a id='line_3668'>horsed his brethren again, and said: Brethren, ye ought to be ashamed</a>
<a id='line_3669'>to fall so off your horses! what is a knight but when he is on</a>
<a id='line_3670'>horseback? I set not by a knight when he is on foot, for all battles on</a>
<a id='line_3671'>foot are but pillers’ battles. For there should no knight fight on foot</a>
<a id='line_3672'>but if it were for treason, or else he were driven thereto by force;</a>
<a id='line_3673'>therefore, brethren, sit fast on your horses, or else fight never more</a>
<a id='line_3674'>afore me.</a>
<a id='line_3675'></a>
<a id='line_3676'>With that came in the Duke Chaleins of Clarance, and there encountered</a>
<a id='line_3677'>with him the Earl Ulbawes of Surluse, and either of them smote other</a>
<a id='line_3678'>down. Then the knights of both parties horsed their lords again, for</a>
<a id='line_3679'>Sir Ector and Bleoberis were on foot, waiting on the Duke Chaleins. And</a>
<a id='line_3680'>the King with the Hundred Knights was with the Earl of Ulbawes. With</a>
<a id='line_3681'>that came Gaheris and lashed to the King with the Hundred Knights, and</a>
<a id='line_3682'>he to him again. Then came the Duke Chaleins and departed them.</a>
<a id='line_3683'></a>
<a id='line_3684'>Then they blew to lodging, and the knights unarmed them and drew them</a>
<a id='line_3685'>to their dinner; and at the midst of their dinner in came Dinadan and</a>
<a id='line_3686'>began to rail. Then he beheld the haut prince, that seemed wroth with</a>
<a id='line_3687'>some fault that he saw; for he had a custom he loved no fish, and</a>
<a id='line_3688'>because he was served with fish, the which he hated, therefore he was</a>
<a id='line_3689'>not merry. When Sir Dinadan had espied the haut prince, he espied where</a>
<a id='line_3690'>was a fish with a great head, and that he gat betwixt two dishes, and</a>
<a id='line_3691'>served the haut prince with that fish. And then he said thus: Sir</a>
<a id='line_3692'>Galahalt, well may I liken you to a wolf, for he will never eat fish,</a>
<a id='line_3693'>but flesh; then the haut prince laughed at his words. Well, well, said</a>
<a id='line_3694'>Dinadan to Launcelot, what devil do ye in this country, for here may no</a>
<a id='line_3695'>mean knights win no worship for thee. Sir Dinadan, said Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_3696'>ensure thee I shall no more meet with thee nor with thy great spear,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>for I may not sit in my saddle when that spear hitteth me. And if I be</a>
<a id='line_3698'>happy I shall beware of that boistous body that thou bearest. Well,</a>
<a id='line_3699'>said Launcelot, make good watch ever: God forbid that ever we meet but</a>
<a id='line_3700'>if it be at a dish of meat. Then laughed the queen and the haut prince,</a>
<a id='line_3701'>that they might not sit at their table; thus they made great joy till</a>
<a id='line_3702'>on the morn, and then they heard mass, and blew to field. And Queen</a>
<a id='line_3703'>Guenever and all the estates were set, and judges armed clean with</a>
<a id='line_3704'>their shields to keep the right.</a>
<a id='line_3705'></a>
<a id='line_3706'></a>
<a id='line_3707'></a>
<a id='line_3708'></a>
<a id='line_3709'>CHAPTER XLIX. Of the seventh battle, and how Sir Launcelot, being</a>
<a id='line_3710'>disguised like a maid, smote down Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_3711'></a>
<a id='line_3712'></a>
<a id='line_3713'>Now beginneth the seventh battle. There came in the Duke Cambines, and</a>
<a id='line_3714'>there encountered with him Sir Aristance, that was counted a good</a>
<a id='line_3715'>knight, and they met so hard that either bare other down, horse and</a>
<a id='line_3716'>man. Then came there the Earl of Lambaile and helped the duke again to</a>
<a id='line_3717'>horse. Then came there Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and he smote the Earl</a>
<a id='line_3718'>Lambaile down from his horse. Then began they to do great deeds of</a>
<a id='line_3719'>arms, and many spears were broken, and many knights were cast to the</a>
<a id='line_3720'>earth. Then the King of Northgalis and the Earl Ulbawes smote together</a>
<a id='line_3721'>that all the judges thought it was like mortal death. This meanwhile</a>
<a id='line_3722'>Queen Guenever, and the haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, made there Sir</a>
<a id='line_3723'>Dinadan make him ready to joust. I would, said Dinadan, ride into the</a>
<a id='line_3724'>field, but then one of you twain will meet with me. Per dieu, said the</a>
<a id='line_3725'>haut prince, ye may see how we sit here as judges with our shields, and</a>
<a id='line_3726'>always mayest thou behold whether we sit here or not.</a>
<a id='line_3727'></a>
<a id='line_3728'>So Sir Dinadan departed and took his horse, and met with many knights,</a>
<a id='line_3729'>and did passing well. And as he was departed, Sir Launcelot disguised</a>
<a id='line_3730'>himself, and put upon his armour a maiden’s garment freshly attired.</a>
<a id='line_3731'>Then Sir Launcelot made Sir Galihodin to lead him through the range,</a>
<a id='line_3732'>and all men had wonder what damosel it was. And so as Sir Dinadan came</a>
<a id='line_3733'>into the range, Sir Launcelot, that was in the damosel’s array, gat</a>
<a id='line_3734'>Galihodin’s spear, and ran unto Sir Dinadan. And always Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_3735'>looked up thereas Sir Launcelot was, and then he saw one sit in the</a>
<a id='line_3736'>stead of Sir Launcelot, armed. But when Dinadan saw a manner of a</a>
<a id='line_3737'>damosel he dread perils that it was Sir Launcelot disguised, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_3738'>Launcelot came on him so fast that he smote him over his horse’s croup;</a>
<a id='line_3739'>and then with great scorns they gat Sir Dinadan into the forest there</a>
<a id='line_3740'>beside, and there they dispoiled him unto his shirt, and put upon him a</a>
<a id='line_3741'>woman’s garment, and so brought him into the field: and so they blew</a>
<a id='line_3742'>unto lodging. And every knight went and unarmed them. Then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_3743'>Dinadan brought in among them all. And when Queen Guenever saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_3744'>Dinadan brought so among them all, then she laughed that she fell down,</a>
<a id='line_3745'>and so did all that there were. Well, said Dinadan to Launcelot, thou</a>
<a id='line_3746'>art so false that I can never beware of thee. Then by all the assent</a>
<a id='line_3747'>they gave Sir Launcelot the prize, the next was Sir Lamorak de Galis,</a>
<a id='line_3748'>the third was Sir Palomides, the fourth was King Bagdemagus; so these</a>
<a id='line_3749'>four knights had the prize, and there was great joy, and great nobley</a>
<a id='line_3750'>in all the court.</a>
<a id='line_3751'></a>
<a id='line_3752'>And on the morn Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot departed unto King</a>
<a id='line_3753'>Arthur, but in no wise Sir Lamorak would not go with them. I shall</a>
<a id='line_3754'>undertake, said Sir Launcelot, that an ye will go with us King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3755'>shall charge Sir Gawaine and his brethren never to do you hurt. As for</a>
<a id='line_3756'>that, said Sir Lamorak, I will not trust Sir Gawaine nor none of his</a>
<a id='line_3757'>brethren; and wit ye well, Sir Launcelot, an it were not for my lord</a>
<a id='line_3758'>King Arthur’s sake, I should match Sir Gawaine and his brethren well</a>
<a id='line_3759'>enough. But to say that I should trust them, that shall I never, and</a>
<a id='line_3760'>therefore I pray you recommend me unto my lord Arthur, and unto all my</a>
<a id='line_3761'>lords of the Round Table. And in what place that ever I come I shall do</a>
<a id='line_3762'>you service to my power: and sir, it is but late that I revenged that,</a>
<a id='line_3763'>when my lord Arthur’s kin were put to the worse by Sir Palomides. Then</a>
<a id='line_3764'>Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Launcelot, and either wept at their</a>
<a id='line_3765'>departing.</a>
<a id='line_3766'></a>
<a id='line_3767'></a>
<a id='line_3768'></a>
<a id='line_3769'></a>
<a id='line_3770'>CHAPTER L. How by treason Sir Tristram was brought to a tournament for</a>
<a id='line_3771'>to have been slain, and how he was put in prison.</a>
<a id='line_3772'></a>
<a id='line_3773'></a>
<a id='line_3774'>Now turn we from this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram, of whom</a>
<a id='line_3775'>this book is principally of, and leave we the king and the queen, Sir</a>
<a id='line_3776'>Launcelot, and Sir Lamorak, and here beginneth the treason of King</a>
<a id='line_3777'>Mark, that he ordained against Sir Tristram. There was cried by the</a>
<a id='line_3778'>coasts of Cornwall a great tournament and jousts, and all was done by</a>
<a id='line_3779'>Sir Galahalt the haut prince and King Bagdemagus, to the intent to slay</a>
<a id='line_3780'>Launcelot, or else utterly destroy him and shame him, because Sir</a>
<a id='line_3781'>Launcelot had always the higher degree, therefore this prince and this</a>
<a id='line_3782'>king made this jousts against Sir Launcelot. And thus their counsel was</a>
<a id='line_3783'>discovered unto King Mark, whereof he was full glad.</a>
<a id='line_3784'></a>
<a id='line_3785'>Then King Mark bethought him that he would have Sir Tristram unto that</a>
<a id='line_3786'>tournament disguised that no man should know him, to that intent that</a>
<a id='line_3787'>the haut prince should ween that Sir Tristram were Sir Launcelot. So at</a>
<a id='line_3788'>these jousts came in Sir Tristram. And at that time Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_3789'>not there, but when they saw a knight disguised do such deeds of arms,</a>
<a id='line_3790'>they weened it had been Sir Launcelot. And in especial King Mark said</a>
<a id='line_3791'>it was Sir Launcelot plainly. Then they set upon him, both King</a>
<a id='line_3792'>Bagdemagus, and the haut prince, and their knights, that it was wonder</a>
<a id='line_3793'>that ever Sir Tristram might endure that pain. Notwithstanding for all</a>
<a id='line_3794'>the pain that he had, Sir Tristram won the degree at that tournament,</a>
<a id='line_3795'>and there he hurt many knights and bruised them, and they hurt him and</a>
<a id='line_3796'>bruised him wonderly sore. So when the jousts were all done they knew</a>
<a id='line_3797'>well that it was Sir Tristram de Liones; and all that were on King</a>
<a id='line_3798'>Mark’s party were glad that Sir Tristram was hurt, and the remnant were</a>
<a id='line_3799'>sorry of his hurt; for Sir Tristram was not so behated as was Sir</a>
<a id='line_3800'>Launcelot within the realm of England.</a>
<a id='line_3801'></a>
<a id='line_3802'>Then came King Mark unto Sir Tristram and said: Fair nephew, I am sorry</a>
<a id='line_3803'>of your hurts. Gramercy my lord, said Sir Tristram. Then King Mark made</a>
<a id='line_3804'>Sir Tristram to be put in an horse bier in great sign of love, and</a>
<a id='line_3805'>said: Fair cousin, I shall be your leech myself. And so he rode forth</a>
<a id='line_3806'>with Sir Tristram, and brought him to a castle by daylight. And then</a>
<a id='line_3807'>King Mark made Sir Tristram to eat. And then after he gave him a drink,</a>
<a id='line_3808'>the which as soon as he had drunk he fell asleep. And when it was night</a>
<a id='line_3809'>he made him to be carried to another castle, and there he put him in a</a>
<a id='line_3810'>strong prison, and there he ordained a man and a woman to give him his</a>
<a id='line_3811'>meat and drink. So there he was a great while.</a>
<a id='line_3812'></a>
<a id='line_3813'>Then was Sir Tristram missed, and no creature wist where he was become.</a>
<a id='line_3814'>When La Beale Isoud heard how he was missed, privily she went unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_3815'>Sadok, and prayed him to espy where was Sir Tristram. Then when Sadok</a>
<a id='line_3816'>wist how Sir Tristram was missed, and anon espied that he was put in</a>
<a id='line_3817'>prison by King Mark and the traitors of Magouns, then Sadok and two of</a>
<a id='line_3818'>his cousins laid them in an ambushment, fast by the Castle of Tintagil,</a>
<a id='line_3819'>in arms. And as by fortune, there came riding King Mark and four of his</a>
<a id='line_3820'>nephews, and a certain of the traitors of Magouns. When Sir Sadok</a>
<a id='line_3821'>espied them he brake out of the bushment, and set there upon them. And</a>
<a id='line_3822'>when King Mark espied Sir Sadok he fled as fast as he might, and there</a>
<a id='line_3823'>Sir Sadok slew all the four nephews unto King Mark. But these traitors</a>
<a id='line_3824'>of Magouns slew one of Sadok’s cousins with a great wound in the neck,</a>
<a id='line_3825'>but Sadok smote the other to the death. Then Sir Sadok rode upon his</a>
<a id='line_3826'>way unto a castle that was called Liones, and there he espied of the</a>
<a id='line_3827'>treason and felony of King Mark. So they of that castle rode with Sir</a>
<a id='line_3828'>Sadok till that they came to a castle that hight Arbray, and there in</a>
<a id='line_3829'>the town they found Sir Dinas the Seneschal, that was a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_3830'>But when Sir Sadok had told Sir Dinas of all the treason of King Mark</a>
<a id='line_3831'>he defied such a king, and said he would give up his lands that he held</a>
<a id='line_3832'>of him. And when he said these words all manner knights said as Sir</a>
<a id='line_3833'>Dinas said. Then by his advice and of Sir Sadok’s, he let stuff all the</a>
<a id='line_3834'>towns and castles within the country of Liones, and assembled all the</a>
<a id='line_3835'>people that they might make.</a>
<a id='line_3836'></a>
<a id='line_3837'></a>
<a id='line_3838'></a>
<a id='line_3839'></a>
<a id='line_3840'>CHAPTER LI. How King Mark let do counterfeit letters from the Pope, and</a>
<a id='line_3841'>how Sir Percivale delivered Sir Tristram out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_3842'></a>
<a id='line_3843'></a>
<a id='line_3844'>Now turn we unto King Mark, that when he was escaped from Sir Sadok he</a>
<a id='line_3845'>rode unto the Castle of Tintagil, and there he made great cry and</a>
<a id='line_3846'>noise, and cried unto harness all that might bear arms. Then they</a>
<a id='line_3847'>sought and found where were dead four cousins of King Mark’s, and the</a>
<a id='line_3848'>traitor of Magouns. Then the king let inter them in a chapel. Then the</a>
<a id='line_3849'>king let cry in all the country that held of him, to go unto arms, for</a>
<a id='line_3850'>he understood to the war he must needs. When King Mark heard and</a>
<a id='line_3851'>understood how Sir Sadok and Sir Dinas were arisen in the country of</a>
<a id='line_3852'>Liones he remembered of wiles and treason. Lo thus he did: he let make</a>
<a id='line_3853'>and counterfeit letters from the Pope, and did make a strange clerk to</a>
<a id='line_3854'>bear them unto King Mark; the which letters specified that King Mark</a>
<a id='line_3855'>should make him ready, upon pain of cursing, with his host to come to</a>
<a id='line_3856'>the Pope, to help to go to Jerusalem, for to make war upon the</a>
<a id='line_3857'>Saracens.</a>
<a id='line_3858'></a>
<a id='line_3859'>When this clerk was come by the mean of the king, anon withal King Mark</a>
<a id='line_3860'>sent these letters unto Sir Tristram and bade him say thus: that an he</a>
<a id='line_3861'>would go war upon the miscreants, he should be had out of prison, and</a>
<a id='line_3862'>to have all his power. When Sir Tristram understood this letter, then</a>
<a id='line_3863'>he said thus to the clerk: Ah, King Mark, ever hast thou been a</a>
<a id='line_3864'>traitor, and ever will be; but, Clerk, said Sir Tristram, say thou thus</a>
<a id='line_3865'>unto King Mark: Since the Apostle Pope hath sent for him, bid him go</a>
<a id='line_3866'>thither himself; for tell him, traitor king as he is, I will not go at</a>
<a id='line_3867'>his commandment, get I out of prison as I may, for I see I am well</a>
<a id='line_3868'>rewarded for my true service. Then the clerk returned unto King Mark,</a>
<a id='line_3869'>and told him of the answer of Sir Tristram. Well, said King Mark, yet</a>
<a id='line_3870'>shall he be beguiled. So he went into his chamber, and counterfeit</a>
<a id='line_3871'>letters; and the letters specified that the Pope desired Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_3872'>to come himself, to make war upon the miscreants. When the clerk was</a>
<a id='line_3873'>come again to Sir Tristram and took him these letters, then Sir</a>
<a id='line_3874'>Tristram beheld these letters, and anon espied they were of King Mark’s</a>
<a id='line_3875'>counterfeiting. Ah, said Sir Tristram, false hast thou been ever, King</a>
<a id='line_3876'>Mark, and so wilt thou end. Then the clerk departed from Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_3877'>and came to King Mark again.</a>
<a id='line_3878'></a>
<a id='line_3879'>By then there were come four wounded knights within the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_3880'>Tintagil, and one of them his neck was nigh broken in twain. Another</a>
<a id='line_3881'>had his arm stricken away, the third was borne through with a spear,</a>
<a id='line_3882'>the fourth had his teeth stricken in twain. And when they came afore</a>
<a id='line_3883'>King Mark they cried and said: King, why fleest thou not, for all this</a>
<a id='line_3884'>country is arisen clearly against thee? Then was King Mark wroth out of</a>
<a id='line_3885'>measure.</a>
<a id='line_3886'></a>
<a id='line_3887'>And in the meanwhile there came into the country Sir Percivale de Galis</a>
<a id='line_3888'>to seek Sir Tristram. And when he heard that Sir Tristram was in</a>
<a id='line_3889'>prison, Sir Percivale made clearly the deliverance of Sir Tristram by</a>
<a id='line_3890'>his knightly means. And when he was so delivered he made great joy of</a>
<a id='line_3891'>Sir Percivale, and so each one of other. Sir Tristram said unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_3892'>Percivale: An ye will abide in these marches I will ride with you. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_3893'>said Percivale, in this country I may not tarry, for I must needs into</a>
<a id='line_3894'>Wales. So Sir Percivale departed from Sir Tristram, and rode straight</a>
<a id='line_3895'>unto King Mark, and told him how he had delivered Sir Tristram; and</a>
<a id='line_3896'>also he told the king that he had done himself great shame for to put</a>
<a id='line_3897'>Sir Tristram in prison, for he is now the knight of most renown in this</a>
<a id='line_3898'>world living. And wit thou well the noblest knights of the world love</a>
<a id='line_3899'>Sir Tristram, and if he will make war upon you ye may not abide it.</a>
<a id='line_3900'>That is truth, said King Mark, but I may not love Sir Tristram because</a>
<a id='line_3901'>he loveth my queen and my wife, La Beale Isoud. Ah, fie for shame, said</a>
<a id='line_3902'>Sir Percivale, say ye never so more. Are ye not uncle unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_3903'>Tristram, and he your nephew? Ye should never think that so noble a</a>
<a id='line_3904'>knight as Sir Tristram is, that he would do himself so great a villainy</a>
<a id='line_3905'>to hold his uncle’s wife; howbeit, said Sir Percivale, he may love your</a>
<a id='line_3906'>queen sinless, because she is called one of the fairest ladies of the</a>
<a id='line_3907'>world.</a>
<a id='line_3908'></a>
<a id='line_3909'>Then Sir Percivale departed from King Mark. So when he was departed</a>
<a id='line_3910'>King Mark bethought him of more treason: notwithstanding King Mark</a>
<a id='line_3911'>granted Sir Percivale never by no manner of means to hurt Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_3912'>So anon King Mark sent unto Sir Dinas the Seneschal that he should put</a>
<a id='line_3913'>down all the people that he had raised, for he sent him an oath that he</a>
<a id='line_3914'>would go himself unto the Pope of Rome to war upon the miscreants; and</a>
<a id='line_3915'>this is a fairer war than thus to arise the people against your king.</a>
<a id='line_3916'>When Sir Dinas understood that King Mark would go upon the miscreants,</a>
<a id='line_3917'>then Sir Dinas in all the haste put down all the people; and when the</a>
<a id='line_3918'>people were departed every man to his home, then King Mark espied where</a>
<a id='line_3919'>was Sir Tristram with La Beale Isoud; and there by treason King Mark</a>
<a id='line_3920'>let take him and put him in prison, contrary to his promise that he</a>
<a id='line_3921'>made unto Sir Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_3922'></a>
<a id='line_3923'>When Queen Isoud understood that Sir Tristram was in prison she made as</a>
<a id='line_3924'>great sorrow as ever made lady or gentlewoman. Then Sir Tristram sent a</a>
<a id='line_3925'>letter unto La Beale Isoud, and prayed her to be his good lady; and if</a>
<a id='line_3926'>it pleased her to make a vessel ready for her and him, he would go with</a>
<a id='line_3927'>her unto the realm of Logris, that is this land. When La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_3928'>understood Sir Tristram’s letters and his intent, she sent him another,</a>
<a id='line_3929'>and bade him be of good comfort, for she would do make the vessel</a>
<a id='line_3930'>ready, and all thing to purpose.</a>
<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>Then La Beale Isoud sent unto Sir Dinas, and to Sadok, and prayed them</a>
<a id='line_3933'>in anywise to take King Mark, and put him in prison, unto the time that</a>
<a id='line_3934'>she and Sir Tristram were departed unto the realm of Logris. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_3935'>Dinas the Seneschal understood the treason of King Mark he promised her</a>
<a id='line_3936'>again, and sent her word that King Mark should be put in prison. And as</a>
<a id='line_3937'>they devised it so it was done. And then Sir Tristram was delivered out</a>
<a id='line_3938'>of prison; and anon in all the haste Queen Isoud and Sir Tristram went</a>
<a id='line_3939'>and took their counsel with that they would have with them when they</a>
<a id='line_3940'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_3941'></a>
<a id='line_3942'></a>
<a id='line_3943'></a>
<a id='line_3944'></a>
<a id='line_3945'>CHAPTER LII. How Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud came unto England, and</a>
<a id='line_3946'>how Sir Launcelot brought them to Joyous Gard.</a>
<a id='line_3947'></a>
<a id='line_3948'></a>
<a id='line_3949'>Then La Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram took their vessel, and came by</a>
<a id='line_3950'>water into this land. And so they were not in this land four days but</a>
<a id='line_3951'>there came a cry of a jousts and tournament that King Arthur let make.</a>
<a id='line_3952'>When Sir Tristram heard tell of that tournament he disguised himself,</a>
<a id='line_3953'>and La Beale Isoud, and rode unto that tournament. And when he came</a>
<a id='line_3954'>there he saw many knights joust and tourney; and so Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_3955'>dressed him to the range, and to make short conclusion, he overthrew</a>
<a id='line_3956'>fourteen knights of the Round Table. When Sir Launcelot saw these</a>
<a id='line_3957'>knights thus overthrown, Sir Launcelot dressed him to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_3958'>That saw La Beale Isoud how Sir Launcelot was come into the field. Then</a>
<a id='line_3959'>La Beale Isoud sent unto Sir Launcelot a ring, and bade him wit that it</a>
<a id='line_3960'>was Sir Tristram de Liones. When Sir Launcelot under stood that there</a>
<a id='line_3961'>was Sir Tristram he was full glad, and would not joust. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_3962'>Launcelot espied whither Sir Tristram yede, and after him he rode; and</a>
<a id='line_3963'>then either made of other great joy. And so Sir Launcelot brought Sir</a>
<a id='line_3964'>Tristram and La Beale Isoud unto Joyous Gard, that was his own castle,</a>
<a id='line_3965'>that he had won with his own hands. And there Sir Launcelot put them in</a>
<a id='line_3966'>to wield for their own. And wit ye well that castle was garnished and</a>
<a id='line_3967'>furnished for a king and a queen royal there to have sojourned. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_3968'>Launcelot charged all his people to honour them and love them as they</a>
<a id='line_3969'>would do himself.</a>
<a id='line_3970'></a>
<a id='line_3971'>So Sir Launcelot departed unto King Arthur; and then he told Queen</a>
<a id='line_3972'>Guenever how he that jousted so well at the last tournament was Sir</a>
<a id='line_3973'>Tristram. And there he told her how he had with him La Beale Isoud</a>
<a id='line_3974'>maugre King Mark, and so Queen Guenever told all this unto King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_3975'>When King Arthur wist that Sir Tristram was escaped and come from King</a>
<a id='line_3976'>Mark, and had brought La Beale Isoud with him, then was he passing</a>
<a id='line_3977'>glad. So because of Sir Tristram King Arthur let make a cry, that on</a>
<a id='line_3978'>May Day should be a jousts before the castle of Lonazep; and that</a>
<a id='line_3979'>castle was fast by Joyous Gard. And thus Arthur devised, that all the</a>
<a id='line_3980'>knights of this land, and of Cornwall, and of North Wales, should joust</a>
<a id='line_3981'>against all these countries, Ireland, Scotland, and the remnant of</a>
<a id='line_3982'>Wales, and the country of Gore, and Surluse, and of Listinoise, and</a>
<a id='line_3983'>they of Northumberland, and all they that held lands of Arthur on this</a>
<a id='line_3984'>half the sea. When this cry was made many knights were glad and many</a>
<a id='line_3985'>were unglad. Sir, said Launcelot unto Arthur, by this cry that ye have</a>
<a id='line_3986'>made ye will put us that be about you in great jeopardy, for there be</a>
<a id='line_3987'>many knights that have great envy to us; therefore when we shall meet</a>
<a id='line_3988'>at the day of jousts there will be hard shift among us. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_3989'>said Arthur, I care not; there shall we prove who shall be best of his</a>
<a id='line_3990'>hands. So when Sir Launcelot understood wherefore King Arthur made this</a>
<a id='line_3991'>jousting, then he made such purveyance that La Beale Isoud should</a>
<a id='line_3992'>behold the jousts in a secret place that was honest for her estate.</a>
<a id='line_3993'></a>
<a id='line_3994'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram and to La Beale Isoud, how they made</a>
<a id='line_3995'>great joy daily together with all manner of mirths that they could</a>
<a id='line_3996'>devise; and every day Sir Tristram would go ride a-hunting, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_3997'>Tristram was that time called the best chaser of the world, and the</a>
<a id='line_3998'>noblest blower of an horn of all manner of measures; for as books</a>
<a id='line_3999'>report, of Sir Tristram came all the good terms of venery and hunting,</a>
<a id='line_4000'>and all the sizes and measures of blowing of an horn; and of him we had</a>
<a id='line_4001'>first all the terms of hawking, and which were beasts of chase and</a>
<a id='line_4002'>beasts of venery, and which were vermins, and all the blasts that long</a>
<a id='line_4003'>to all manner of games. First to the uncoupling, to the seeking, to the</a>
<a id='line_4004'>rechate, to the flight, to the death, and to strake, and many other</a>
<a id='line_4005'>blasts and terms, that all manner of gentlemen have cause to the</a>
<a id='line_4006'>world’s end to praise Sir Tristram, and to pray for his soul.</a>
<a id='line_4007'></a>
<a id='line_4008'></a>
<a id='line_4009'></a>
<a id='line_4010'></a>
<a id='line_4011'>CHAPTER LIII. How by the counsel of La Beale Isoud Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_4012'>armed, and how he met with Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_4013'></a>
<a id='line_4014'></a>
<a id='line_4015'>So on a day La Beale Isoud said unto Sir Tristram: I marvel me much,</a>
<a id='line_4016'>said she, that ye remember not yourself, how ye be here in a strange</a>
<a id='line_4017'>country, and here be many perilous knights; and well ye wot that King</a>
<a id='line_4018'>Mark is full of treason; and that ye will ride thus to chase and to</a>
<a id='line_4019'>hunt unarmed ye might be destroyed. My fair lady and my love, I cry you</a>
<a id='line_4020'>mercy, I will no more do so. So then Sir Tristram rode daily a-hunting</a>
<a id='line_4021'>armed, and his men bearing his shield and his spear. So on a day a</a>
<a id='line_4022'>little afore the month of May, Sir Tristram chased an hart passing</a>
<a id='line_4023'>eagerly, and so the hart passed by a fair well. And then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_4024'>alighted and put off his helm to drink of that bubbly water. Right so</a>
<a id='line_4025'>he heard and saw the Questing Beast come to the well. When Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_4026'>saw that beast he put on his helm, for he deemed he should hear of Sir</a>
<a id='line_4027'>Palomides, for that beast was his quest. Right so Sir Tristram saw</a>
<a id='line_4028'>where came a knight armed, upon a noble courser, and he saluted him,</a>
<a id='line_4029'>and they spake of many things; and this knight’s name was Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_4030'>Pité. And right so withal there came unto them the noble knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_4031'>Palomides, and either saluted other, and spake fair to other.</a>
<a id='line_4032'></a>
<a id='line_4033'>Fair knights, said Sir Palomides, I can tell you tidings. What is that?</a>
<a id='line_4034'>said those knights. Sirs, wit ye well that King Mark is put in prison</a>
<a id='line_4035'>by his own knights, and all was for love of Sir Tristram; for King Mark</a>
<a id='line_4036'>had put Sir Tristram twice in prison, and once Sir Percivale delivered</a>
<a id='line_4037'>the noble knight Sir Tristram out of prison. And at the last time Queen</a>
<a id='line_4038'>La Beale Isoud delivered him, and went clearly away with him into this</a>
<a id='line_4039'>realm; and all this while King Mark, the false traitor, is in prison.</a>
<a id='line_4040'>Is this truth? said Palomides; then shall we hastily hear of Sir</a>
<a id='line_4041'>Tristram. And as for to say that I love La Beale Isoud paramours, I</a>
<a id='line_4042'>dare make good that I do, and that she hath my service above all other</a>
<a id='line_4043'>ladies, and shall have the term of my life.</a>
<a id='line_4044'></a>
<a id='line_4045'>And right so as they stood talking they saw afore them where came a</a>
<a id='line_4046'>knight all armed, on a great horse, and one of his men bare his shield,</a>
<a id='line_4047'>and the other his spear. And anon as that knight espied them he gat his</a>
<a id='line_4048'>shield and his spear and dressed him to joust. Fair fellows, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4049'>Tristram, yonder is a knight will joust with us, let see which of us</a>
<a id='line_4050'>shall encounter with him, for I see well he is of the court of King</a>
<a id='line_4051'>Arthur. It shall not be long or he be met withal, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_4052'>for I found never no knight in my quest of this glasting beast, but an</a>
<a id='line_4053'>he would joust I never refused him. As well may I, said Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_4054'>Pité, follow that beast as ye. Then shall ye do battle with me, said</a>
<a id='line_4055'>Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_4056'></a>
<a id='line_4057'>So Sir Palomides dressed him unto that other knight, Sir Bleoberis,</a>
<a id='line_4058'>that was a full noble knight, nigh kin unto Sir Launcelot. And so they</a>
<a id='line_4059'>met so hard that Sir Palomides fell to the earth, horse and all. Then</a>
<a id='line_4060'>Sir Bleoberis cried aloud and said thus: Make thee ready thou false</a>
<a id='line_4061'>traitor knight, Breuse Saunce Pité, for wit thou certainly I will have</a>
<a id='line_4062'>ado with thee to the utterance for the noble knights and ladies that</a>
<a id='line_4063'>thou hast falsely betrayed. When this false knight and traitor, Breuse</a>
<a id='line_4064'>Saunce Pité, heard him say so, he took his horse by the bridle and fled</a>
<a id='line_4065'>his way as fast as ever his horse might run, for sore he was of him</a>
<a id='line_4066'>afeard. When Sir Bleoberis saw him flee he followed fast after, through</a>
<a id='line_4067'>thick and through thin. And by fortune as Sir Breuse fled, he saw even</a>
<a id='line_4068'>afore him three knights of the Table Round, of the which the one hight</a>
<a id='line_4069'>Sir Ector de Maris, the other hight Sir Percivale de Galis, the third</a>
<a id='line_4070'>hight Sir Harry le Fise Lake, a good knight and an hardy. And as for</a>
<a id='line_4071'>Sir Percivale, he was called that time of his time one of the best</a>
<a id='line_4072'>knights of the world, and the best assured. When Breuse saw these</a>
<a id='line_4073'>knights he rode straight unto them, and cried unto them and prayed them</a>
<a id='line_4074'>of rescues. What need have ye? said Sir Ector. Ah, fair knights, said</a>
<a id='line_4075'>Sir Breuse, here followeth me the most traitor knight, and most coward,</a>
<a id='line_4076'>and most of villainy; his name is Breuse Saunce Pité, and if he may get</a>
<a id='line_4077'>me he will slay me without mercy and pity. Abide with us, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4078'>Percivale, and we shall warrant you.</a>
<a id='line_4079'></a>
<a id='line_4080'>Then were they ware of Sir Bleoberis that came riding all that he</a>
<a id='line_4081'>might. Then Sir Ector put himself forth to joust afore them all. When</a>
<a id='line_4082'>Sir Bleoberis saw that they were four knights and he but himself, he</a>
<a id='line_4083'>stood in a doubt whether he would turn or hold his way. Then he said to</a>
<a id='line_4084'>himself: I am a knight of the Table Round, and rather than I should</a>
<a id='line_4085'>shame mine oath and my blood I will hold my way whatsoever fall</a>
<a id='line_4086'>thereof. And then Sir Ector dressed his spear, and smote either other</a>
<a id='line_4087'>passing sore, but Sir Ector fell to the earth. That saw Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_4088'>and he dressed his horse toward him all that he might drive, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_4089'>Percivale had such a stroke that horse and man fell to the earth. When</a>
<a id='line_4090'>Sir Harry saw that they were both to the earth then he said to himself:</a>
<a id='line_4091'>Never was Breuse of such prowess. So Sir Harry dressed his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_4092'>they met together so strongly that both the horses and knights fell to</a>
<a id='line_4093'>the earth, but Sir Bleoberis’ horse began to recover again. That saw</a>
<a id='line_4094'>Breuse and he came hurtling, and smote him over and over, and would</a>
<a id='line_4095'>have slain him as he lay on the ground. Then Sir Harry le Fise Lake</a>
<a id='line_4096'>arose lightly, and took the bridle of Sir Breuse’s horse, and said: Fie</a>
<a id='line_4097'>for shame! strike never a knight when he is at the earth, for this</a>
<a id='line_4098'>knight may be called no shameful knight of his deeds, for yet as men</a>
<a id='line_4099'>may see thereas he lieth on the ground he hath done worshipfully, and</a>
<a id='line_4100'>put to the worse passing good knights. Therefore will I not let, said</a>
<a id='line_4101'>Sir Breuse. Thou shalt not choose, said Sir Harry, as at this time.</a>
<a id='line_4102'>Then when Sir Breuse saw that he might not choose nor have his will he</a>
<a id='line_4103'>spake fair. Then Sir Harry let him go. And then anon he made his horse</a>
<a id='line_4104'>to run over Sir Bleoberis, and rashed him to the earth like if he would</a>
<a id='line_4105'>have slain him. When Sir Harry saw him do so villainously he cried:</a>
<a id='line_4106'>Traitor knight, leave off for shame. And as Sir Harry would have taken</a>
<a id='line_4107'>his horse to fight with Sir Breuse, then Sir Breuse ran upon him as he</a>
<a id='line_4108'>was half upon his horse, and smote him down, horse and man, to the</a>
<a id='line_4109'>earth, and had near slain Sir Harry, the good knight. That saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_4110'>Percivale, and then he cried: Traitor knight what dost thou? And when</a>
<a id='line_4111'>Sir Percivale was upon his horse Sir Breuse took his horse and fled all</a>
<a id='line_4112'>that ever he might, and Sir Percivale and Sir Harry followed after him</a>
<a id='line_4113'>fast, but ever the longer they chased the farther were they behind.</a>
<a id='line_4114'></a>
<a id='line_4115'>Then they turned again and came to Sir Ector de Maris and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_4116'>Bleoberis. Ah, fair knights, said Bleoberis, why have ye succoured that</a>
<a id='line_4117'>false knight and traitor? Why said Sir Harry, what knight is he? for</a>
<a id='line_4118'>well I wot it is a false knight, said Sir Harry, and a coward and a</a>
<a id='line_4119'>felonious knight. Sir, said Bleoberis, he is the most coward knight,</a>
<a id='line_4120'>and a devourer of ladies and a destroyer of good knights and especially</a>
<a id='line_4121'>of Arthur’s. What is your name? said Sir Ector. My name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_4122'>Bleoberis de Ganis. Alas, fair cousin, said Ector, forgive it me, for I</a>
<a id='line_4123'>am Sir Ector de Maris. Then Sir Percivale and Sir Harry made great joy</a>
<a id='line_4124'>that they met with Bleoberis, but all they were heavy that Sir Breuse</a>
<a id='line_4125'>was escaped them, whereof they made great dole.</a>
<a id='line_4126'></a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'></a>
<a id='line_4129'></a>
<a id='line_4130'>CHAPTER LIV. Of Sir Palomides, and how he met with Sir Bleoberis and</a>
<a id='line_4131'>with Sir Ector, and of Sir Pervivale.</a>
<a id='line_4132'></a>
<a id='line_4133'></a>
<a id='line_4134'>Right so as they stood thus there came Sir Palomides, and when he saw</a>
<a id='line_4135'>the shield of Bleoberis lie on the earth, then said Palomides: He that</a>
<a id='line_4136'>oweth that shield let him dress him to me, for he smote me down here</a>
<a id='line_4137'>fast by at a fountain, and therefore I will fight for him on foot. I am</a>
<a id='line_4138'>ready, said Bleoberis, here to answer thee, for wit thou well, sir</a>
<a id='line_4139'>knight, it was I, and my name is Bleoberis de Ganis. Well art thou met,</a>
<a id='line_4140'>said Palomides, and wit thou well my name is Palomides the Saracen; and</a>
<a id='line_4141'>either of them hated other to the death. Sir Palomides, said Ector, wit</a>
<a id='line_4142'>thou well there is neither thou nor none knight that beareth the life</a>
<a id='line_4143'>that slayeth any of our blood but he shall die for it; therefore an</a>
<a id='line_4144'>thou list to fight go seek Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram, and there</a>
<a id='line_4145'>shall ye find your match. With them have I met, said Palomides, but I</a>
<a id='line_4146'>had never no worship of them. Was there never no manner of knight, said</a>
<a id='line_4147'>Sir Ector, but they that ever matched with you? Yes, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_4148'>there was the third, a good knight as any of them, and of his age he</a>
<a id='line_4149'>was the best that ever I found; for an he might have lived till he had</a>
<a id='line_4150'>been an hardier man there liveth no knight now such, and his name was</a>
<a id='line_4151'>Sir Lamorak de Galis. And as he had jousted at a tournament there he</a>
<a id='line_4152'>overthrew me and thirty knights more, and there he won the degree. And</a>
<a id='line_4153'>at his departing there met him Sir Gawaine and his brethren, and with</a>
<a id='line_4154'>great pain they slew him feloniously, unto all good knights’ great</a>
<a id='line_4155'>damage. Anon as Sir Percivale heard that his brother was dead, Sir</a>
<a id='line_4156'>Lamorak, he fell over his horse’s mane swooning, and there he made the</a>
<a id='line_4157'>greatest dole that ever made knight. And when Sir Percivale arose he</a>
<a id='line_4158'>said: Alas, my good and noble brother Sir Lamorak, now shall we never</a>
<a id='line_4159'>meet, and I trow in all the wide world a man may not find such a knight</a>
<a id='line_4160'>as he was of his age; and it is too much to suffer the death of our</a>
<a id='line_4161'>father King Pellinore, and now the death of our good brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_4162'>Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_4163'></a>
<a id='line_4164'>Then in the meanwhile there came a varlet from the court of King</a>
<a id='line_4165'>Arthur, and told them of the great tournament that should be at</a>
<a id='line_4166'>Lonazep, and how these lands, Cornwall and Northgalis, should be</a>
<a id='line_4167'>against all them that would come.</a>
<a id='line_4168'></a>
<a id='line_4169'></a>
<a id='line_4170'></a>
<a id='line_4171'></a>
<a id='line_4172'>CHAPTER LV. How Sir Tristram met with Sir Dinadan, and of their</a>
<a id='line_4173'>devices, and what he said to Sir Gawaine’s brethren.</a>
<a id='line_4174'></a>
<a id='line_4175'></a>
<a id='line_4176'>Now turn we unto Sir Tristram, that as he rode a-hunting he met with</a>
<a id='line_4177'>Sir Dinadan, that was come into that country to seek Sir Tristram. Then</a>
<a id='line_4178'>Sir Dinadan told Sir Tristram his name, but Sir Tristram would not tell</a>
<a id='line_4179'>him his name, wherefore Sir Dinadan was wroth. For such a foolish</a>
<a id='line_4180'>knight as ye are, said Sir Dinadan, I saw but late this day lying by a</a>
<a id='line_4181'>well, and he fared as he slept; and there he lay like a fool grinning,</a>
<a id='line_4182'>and would not speak, and his shield lay by him, and his horse stood by</a>
<a id='line_4183'>him; and well I wot he was a lover. Ah, fair sir, said Sir Tristram are</a>
<a id='line_4184'>ye not a lover? Mary, fie on that craft! said Sir Dinadan. That is evil</a>
<a id='line_4185'>said, said Sir Tristram, for a knight may never be of prowess but if he</a>
<a id='line_4186'>be a lover. It is well said, said Sir Dinadan; now tell me your name,</a>
<a id='line_4187'>sith ye be a lover, or else I shall do battle with you. As for that,</a>
<a id='line_4188'>said Sir Tristram, it is no reason to fight with me but I tell you my</a>
<a id='line_4189'>name; and as for that my name shall ye not wit as at this time. Fie for</a>
<a id='line_4190'>shame, said Dinadan, art thou a knight and durst not tell thy name to</a>
<a id='line_4191'>me? therefore I will fight with thee. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_4192'>will be advised, for I will not do battle but if me list. And if I do</a>
<a id='line_4193'>battle, said Sir Tristram, ye are not able to withstand me. Fie on</a>
<a id='line_4194'>thee, coward, said Sir Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_4195'></a>
<a id='line_4196'>And thus as they hoved still, they saw a knight come riding against</a>
<a id='line_4197'>them. Lo, said Sir Tristram, see where cometh a knight riding will</a>
<a id='line_4198'>joust with you. Anon, as Sir Dinadan beheld him he said: That is the</a>
<a id='line_4199'>same doted knight that I saw lie by the well, neither sleeping nor</a>
<a id='line_4200'>waking. Well, said Sir Tristram, I know that knight well with the</a>
<a id='line_4201'>covered shield of azure, he is the king’s son of Northumberland, his</a>
<a id='line_4202'>name is Epinegris; and he is as great a lover as I know, and he loveth</a>
<a id='line_4203'>the king’s daughter of Wales, a full fair lady. And now I suppose, said</a>
<a id='line_4204'>Sir Tristram, an ye require him he will joust with you, and then shall</a>
<a id='line_4205'>ye prove whether a lover be a better knight, or ye that will not love</a>
<a id='line_4206'>no lady. Well, said Dinadan, now shalt thou see what I shall do.</a>
<a id='line_4207'>Therewithal Sir Dinadan spake on high and said: Sir knight, make thee</a>
<a id='line_4208'>ready to joust with me, for it is the custom of errant knights one to</a>
<a id='line_4209'>joust with other. Sir, said Epinegris, is that the rule of you errant</a>
<a id='line_4210'>knights for to make a knight to joust, will he or nill? As for that,</a>
<a id='line_4211'>said Dinadan, make thee ready, for here is for me. And therewithal they</a>
<a id='line_4212'>spurred their horses and met together so hard that Epinegris smote down</a>
<a id='line_4213'>Sir Dinadan. Then Sir Tristram rode to Sir Dinadan and said: How now,</a>
<a id='line_4214'>meseemeth the lover hath well sped. Fie on thee, coward, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4215'>Dinadan, and if thou be a good knight revenge me. Nay, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4216'>Tristram, I will not joust as at this time, but take your horse and let</a>
<a id='line_4217'>us go hence. God defend me, said Sir Dinadan, from thy fellowship, for</a>
<a id='line_4218'>I never sped well since I met with thee: and so they departed. Well,</a>
<a id='line_4219'>said Sir Tristram, peradventure I could tell you tidings of Sir</a>
<a id='line_4220'>Tristram. God defend me, said Dinadan, from thy fellowship, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_4221'>Tristram were mickle the worse an he were in thy company; and then they</a>
<a id='line_4222'>departed. Sir, said Sir Tristram, yet it may happen I shall meet with</a>
<a id='line_4223'>you in other places.</a>
<a id='line_4224'></a>
<a id='line_4225'>So rode Sir Tristram unto Joyous Gard, and there he heard in that town</a>
<a id='line_4226'>great noise and cry. What is this noise? said Sir Tristram. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_4227'>they, here is a knight of this castle that hath been long among us, and</a>
<a id='line_4228'>right now he is slain with two knights, and for none other cause but</a>
<a id='line_4229'>that our knight said that Sir Launcelot were a better knight than Sir</a>
<a id='line_4230'>Gawaine. That was a simple cause, said Sir Tristram, for to slay a good</a>
<a id='line_4231'>knight for to say well by his master. That is little remedy to us, said</a>
<a id='line_4232'>the men of the town. For an Sir Launcelot had been here soon we should</a>
<a id='line_4233'>have been revenged upon the false knights.</a>
<a id='line_4234'></a>
<a id='line_4235'>When Sir Tristram heard them say so he sent for his shield and for his</a>
<a id='line_4236'>spear, and lightly within a while he had overtaken them, and bade them</a>
<a id='line_4237'>turn and amend that they had misdone. What amends wouldst thou have?</a>
<a id='line_4238'>said the one knight. And therewith they took their course, and either</a>
<a id='line_4239'>met other so hard that Sir Tristram smote down that knight over his</a>
<a id='line_4240'>horse’s tail. Then the other knight dressed him to Sir Tristram, and in</a>
<a id='line_4241'>the same wise he served the other knight. And then they gat off their</a>
<a id='line_4242'>horses as well as they might, and dressed their shields and swords to</a>
<a id='line_4243'>do their battle to the utterance. Knights, said Sir Tristram, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4244'>tell me of whence ye are, and what be your names, for such men ye might</a>
<a id='line_4245'>be ye should hard escape my hands; and ye might be such men of such a</a>
<a id='line_4246'>country that for all your evil deeds ye should pass quit. Wit thou</a>
<a id='line_4247'>well, sir knight, said they, we fear not to tell thee our names, for my</a>
<a id='line_4248'>name is Sir Agravaine, and my name is Gaheris, brethren unto the good</a>
<a id='line_4249'>knight Sir Gawaine, and we be nephews unto King Arthur. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4250'>Tristram, for King Arthur’s sake I shall let you pass as at this time.</a>
<a id='line_4251'>But it is shame, said Sir Tristram, that Sir Gawaine and ye be come of</a>
<a id='line_4252'>so great a blood that ye four brethren are so named as ye be, for ye be</a>
<a id='line_4253'>called the greatest destroyers and murderers of good knights that be</a>
<a id='line_4254'>now in this realm; for it is but as I heard say that Sir Gawaine and ye</a>
<a id='line_4255'>slew among you a better knight than ever ye were, that was the noble</a>
<a id='line_4256'>knight Sir Lamorak de Galis. An it had pleased God, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_4257'>I would I had been by Sir Lamorak at his death. Then shouldst thou have</a>
<a id='line_4258'>gone the same way, said Sir Gaheris. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_4259'>there must have been many more knights than ye are. And therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_4260'>Tristram departed from them toward Joyous Gard. And when he was</a>
<a id='line_4261'>departed they took their horses, and the one said to the other: We will</a>
<a id='line_4262'>overtake him and be revenged upon him in the despite of Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_4263'></a>
<a id='line_4264'></a>
<a id='line_4265'></a>
<a id='line_4266'></a>
<a id='line_4267'>CHAPTER LVI. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_4268'>and how Sir Dinadan was sent for by La Beale Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_4269'></a>
<a id='line_4270'></a>
<a id='line_4271'>So when they had overtaken Sir Tristram, Sir Agravaine bade him: Turn,</a>
<a id='line_4272'>traitor knight. That is evil said, said Sir Tristram; and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_4273'>pulled out his sword, and smote Sir Agravaine such a buffet upon the</a>
<a id='line_4274'>helm that he tumbled down off his horse in a swoon, and he had a</a>
<a id='line_4275'>grievous wound. And then he turned to Gaheris, and Sir Tristram smote</a>
<a id='line_4276'>his sword and his helm together with such a might that Gaheris fell out</a>
<a id='line_4277'>of his saddle: and so Sir Tristram rode unto Joyous Gard, and there he</a>
<a id='line_4278'>alighted and unarmed him. So Sir Tristram told La Beale Isoud of all</a>
<a id='line_4279'>his adventure, as ye have heard to-fore. And when she heard him tell of</a>
<a id='line_4280'>Sir Dinadan: Sir, said she, is not that he that made the song by King</a>
<a id='line_4281'>Mark? That same is he, said Sir Tristram, for he is the best bourder</a>
<a id='line_4282'>and japer, and a noble knight of his hands, and the best fellow that I</a>
<a id='line_4283'>know, and all good knights love his fellowship. Alas, sir, said she,</a>
<a id='line_4284'>why brought ye not him with you? Have ye no care, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_4285'>for he rideth to seek me in this country; and therefore he will not</a>
<a id='line_4286'>away till he have met with me. And there Sir Tristram told La Beale</a>
<a id='line_4287'>Isoud how Sir Dinadan held against all lovers. Right so there came in a</a>
<a id='line_4288'>varlet and told Sir Tristram how there was come an errant knight into</a>
<a id='line_4289'>the town, with such colours upon his shield. That is Sir Dinadan, said</a>
<a id='line_4290'>Sir Tristram; wit ye what ye shall do, said Sir Tristram: send ye for</a>
<a id='line_4291'>him, my Lady Isoud, and I will not be seen, and ye shall hear the</a>
<a id='line_4292'>merriest knight that ever ye spake withal, and the maddest talker; and</a>
<a id='line_4293'>I pray you heartily that ye make him good cheer.</a>
<a id='line_4294'></a>
<a id='line_4295'>Then anon La Beale Isoud sent into the town, and prayed Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_4296'>that he would come into the castle and repose him there with a lady.</a>
<a id='line_4297'>With a good will, said Sir Dinadan; and so he mounted upon his horse</a>
<a id='line_4298'>and rode into the castle; and there he alighted, and was unarmed, and</a>
<a id='line_4299'>brought into the castle. Anon La Beale Isoud came unto him, and either</a>
<a id='line_4300'>saluted other; then she asked him of whence that he was. Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_4301'>Dinadan, I am of the court of King Arthur, and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_4302'>Round, and my name is Sir Dinadan. What do ye in this country? said La</a>
<a id='line_4303'>Beale Isoud. Madam, said he, I seek Sir Tristram the good knight, for</a>
<a id='line_4304'>it was told me that he was in this country. It may well be, said La</a>
<a id='line_4305'>Beale Isoud, but I am not ware of him. Madam, said Dinadan, I marvel of</a>
<a id='line_4306'>Sir Tristram and mo other lovers, what aileth them to be so mad and so</a>
<a id='line_4307'>sotted upon women. Why, said La Beale Isoud, are ye a knight and be no</a>
<a id='line_4308'>lover? it is shame to you: wherefore ye may not be called a good knight</a>
<a id='line_4309'>[but] if ye make a quarrel for a lady. God defend me, said Dinadan, for</a>
<a id='line_4310'>the joy of love is too short, and the sorrow thereof, and what cometh</a>
<a id='line_4311'>thereof, dureth over long. Ah, said La Beale Isoud, say ye not so, for</a>
<a id='line_4312'>here fast by was the good knight Sir Bleoberis, that fought with three</a>
<a id='line_4313'>knights at once for a damosel’s sake, and he won her afore the King of</a>
<a id='line_4314'>Northumberland. It was so, said Sir Dinadan, for I know him well for a</a>
<a id='line_4315'>good knight and a noble, and come of noble blood; for all be noble</a>
<a id='line_4316'>knights of whom he is come of, that is Sir Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_4317'></a>
<a id='line_4318'>Now I pray you, said La Beale Isoud, tell me will you fight for my love</a>
<a id='line_4319'>with three knights that do me great wrong? and insomuch as ye be a</a>
<a id='line_4320'>knight of King Arthur’s I require you to do battle for me. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_4321'>Dinadan said: I shall say you ye be as fair a lady as ever I saw any,</a>
<a id='line_4322'>and much fairer than is my lady Queen Guenever, but wit ye well at one</a>
<a id='line_4323'>word, I will not fight for you with three knights, Jesu defend me. Then</a>
<a id='line_4324'>Isoud laughed, and had good game at him. So he had all the cheer that</a>
<a id='line_4325'>she might make him, and there he lay all that night. And on the morn</a>
<a id='line_4326'>early Sir Tristram armed him, and La Beale Isoud gave him a good helm;</a>
<a id='line_4327'>and then he promised her that he would meet with Sir Dinadan, and they</a>
<a id='line_4328'>two would ride together into Lonazep, where the tournament should be:</a>
<a id='line_4329'>And there shall I make ready for you where ye shall see the tournament.</a>
<a id='line_4330'>Then departed Sir Tristram with two squires that bare his shield and</a>
<a id='line_4331'>his spears that were great and long.</a>
<a id='line_4332'></a>
<a id='line_4333'></a>
<a id='line_4334'></a>
<a id='line_4335'></a>
<a id='line_4336'>CHAPTER LVII. How Sir Dinadan met with Sir Tristram, and with jousting</a>
<a id='line_4337'>with Sir Palomides, Sir Dinadan knew him.</a>
<a id='line_4338'></a>
<a id='line_4339'></a>
<a id='line_4340'>Then after that Sir Dinadan departed, and rode his way a great pace</a>
<a id='line_4341'>until he had overtaken Sir Tristram. And when Sir Dinadan had overtaken</a>
<a id='line_4342'>him he knew him anon, and he hated the fellowship of him above all</a>
<a id='line_4343'>other knights. Ah, said Sir Dinadan, art thou that coward knight that I</a>
<a id='line_4344'>met with yesterday? keep thee, for thou shalt joust with me maugre thy</a>
<a id='line_4345'>head. Well, said Sir Tristram, and I am loath to joust. And so they let</a>
<a id='line_4346'>their horses run, and Sir Tristram missed of him a-purpose, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_4347'>Dinadan brake a spear upon Sir Tristram, and therewith Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_4348'>dressed him to draw out his sword. Not so, said Sir Tristram, why are</a>
<a id='line_4349'>ye so wroth? I will not fight. Fie on thee, coward, said Dinadan, thou</a>
<a id='line_4350'>shamest all knights. As for that, said Sir Tristram, I care not, for I</a>
<a id='line_4351'>will wait upon you and be under your protection; for because ye are so</a>
<a id='line_4352'>good a knight ye may save me. The devil deliver me of thee, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4353'>Dinadan, for thou art as goodly a man of arms and of thy person as ever</a>
<a id='line_4354'>I saw, and the most coward that ever I saw. What wilt thou do with</a>
<a id='line_4355'>those great spears that thou carriest with thee? I shall give them,</a>
<a id='line_4356'>said Sir Tristram, to some good knight when I come to the tournament;</a>
<a id='line_4357'>and if I see you do best, I shall give them to you.</a>
<a id='line_4358'></a>
<a id='line_4359'>So thus as they rode talking they saw where came an errant knight afore</a>
<a id='line_4360'>them, that dressed him to joust. Lo, said Sir Tristram, yonder is one</a>
<a id='line_4361'>will joust; now dress thee to him. Ah, shame betide thee, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4362'>Dinadan. Nay, not so, said Tristram, for that knight beseemeth a shrew.</a>
<a id='line_4363'>Then shall I, said Sir Dinadan. And so they dressed their shields and</a>
<a id='line_4364'>their spears, and they met together so hard that the other knight smote</a>
<a id='line_4365'>down Sir Dinadan from his horse. Lo, said Sir Tristram, it had been</a>
<a id='line_4366'>better ye had left. Fie on thee, coward, said Sir Dinadan. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_4367'>Dinadan started up and gat his sword in his hand, and proffered to do</a>
<a id='line_4368'>battle on foot. Whether in love or in wrath? said the other knight. Let</a>
<a id='line_4369'>us do battle in love, said Sir Dinadan. What is your name, said that</a>
<a id='line_4370'>knight, I pray you tell me. Wit ye well my name is Sir Dinadan. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_4371'>Dinadan, said that knight, and my name is Gareth, the youngest brother</a>
<a id='line_4372'>unto Sir Gawaine. Then either made of other great cheer, for this</a>
<a id='line_4373'>Gareth was the best knight of all the brethren, and he proved a good</a>
<a id='line_4374'>knight. Then they took their horses, and there they spake of Sir</a>
<a id='line_4375'>Tristram, how such a coward he was; and every word Sir Tristram heard</a>
<a id='line_4376'>and laughed them to scorn.</a>
<a id='line_4377'></a>
<a id='line_4378'>Then were they ware where came a knight afore them well horsed and well</a>
<a id='line_4379'>armed, and he made him ready to joust. Fair knights, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_4380'>look betwixt you who shall joust with yonder knight, for I warn you I</a>
<a id='line_4381'>will not have ado with him. Then shall I, said Sir Gareth. And so they</a>
<a id='line_4382'>encountered together, and there that knight smote down Sir Gareth over</a>
<a id='line_4383'>his horse’s croup. How now, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Dinadan, dress</a>
<a id='line_4384'>thee now and revenge the good knight Gareth. That shall I not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4385'>Dinadan, for he hath stricken down a much bigger knight than I am. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_4386'>said Sir Tristram, now Sir Dinadan, I see and feel well your heart</a>
<a id='line_4387'>faileth you, therefore now shall ye see what I shall do. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_4388'>Tristram hurtled unto that knight, and smote him quite from his horse.</a>
<a id='line_4389'>And when Sir Dinadan saw that, he marvelled greatly; and then he deemed</a>
<a id='line_4390'>that it was Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>Then this knight that was on foot pulled out his sword to do battle.</a>
<a id='line_4393'>What is your name? said Sir Tristram. Wit ye well, said that knight, my</a>
<a id='line_4394'>name is Sir Palomides. What knight hate ye most? said Sir Tristram. Sir</a>
<a id='line_4395'>knight, said he, I hate Sir Tristram to the death, for an I may meet</a>
<a id='line_4396'>with him the one of us shall die. Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_4397'>wit ye well that I am Sir Tristram de Liones, and now do your worst.</a>
<a id='line_4398'>When Sir Palomides heard him say so he was astonied. And then he said</a>
<a id='line_4399'>thus: I pray you, Sir Tristram, forgive me all mine evil will, and if I</a>
<a id='line_4400'>live I shall do you service above all other knights that be living; and</a>
<a id='line_4401'>whereas I have owed you evil will me sore repenteth. I wot not what</a>
<a id='line_4402'>aileth me, for meseemeth that ye are a good knight, and none other</a>
<a id='line_4403'>knight that named himself a good knight should not hate you; therefore</a>
<a id='line_4404'>I require you, Sir Tristram, take no displeasure at mine unkind words.</a>
<a id='line_4405'>Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, ye say well, and well I wot ye are a</a>
<a id='line_4406'>good knight, for I have seen ye proved; and many great enterprises have</a>
<a id='line_4407'>ye taken upon you, and well achieved them; therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4408'>Tristram, an ye have any evil will to me, now may ye right it, for I am</a>
<a id='line_4409'>ready at your hand. Not so, my lord Sir Tristram, I will do you</a>
<a id='line_4410'>knightly service in all thing as ye will command. And right so I will</a>
<a id='line_4411'>take you, said Sir Tristram. And so they rode forth on their ways</a>
<a id='line_4412'>talking of many things. O my lord Sir Tristram, said Dinadan, foul have</a>
<a id='line_4413'>ye mocked me, for God knoweth I came into this country for your sake,</a>
<a id='line_4414'>and by the advice of my lord Sir Launcelot; and yet would not Sir</a>
<a id='line_4415'>Launcelot tell me the certainty of you, where I should find you. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_4416'>said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot wist well where I was, for I abode</a>
<a id='line_4417'>within his own castle.</a>
<a id='line_4418'></a>
<a id='line_4419'></a>
<a id='line_4420'></a>
<a id='line_4421'></a>
<a id='line_4422'>CHAPTER LVIII. How they approached the Castle Lonazep, and of other</a>
<a id='line_4423'>devices of the death of Sir Lamorak.</a>
<a id='line_4424'></a>
<a id='line_4425'></a>
<a id='line_4426'>Thus they rode until they were ware of the Castle Lonazep. And then</a>
<a id='line_4427'>were they ware of four hundred tents and pavilions, and marvellous</a>
<a id='line_4428'>great ordinance. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, yonder I see the</a>
<a id='line_4429'>greatest ordinance that ever I saw. Sir, said Palomides, meseemeth that</a>
<a id='line_4430'>there was as great an ordinance at the Castle of Maidens upon the rock,</a>
<a id='line_4431'>where ye won the prize, for I saw myself where ye forjousted thirty</a>
<a id='line_4432'>knights. Sir, said Dinadan, and in Surluse, at that tournament that</a>
<a id='line_4433'>Galahalt of the Long Isles made, the which there dured seven days, was</a>
<a id='line_4434'>as great a gathering as is here, for there were many nations. Who was</a>
<a id='line_4435'>the best? said Sir Tristram. Sir, it was Sir Launcelot du Lake and the</a>
<a id='line_4436'>noble knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, and Sir Launcelot won the degree. I</a>
<a id='line_4437'>doubt not, said Sir Tristram, but he won the degree, so he had not been</a>
<a id='line_4438'>overmatched with many knights; and of the death of Sir Lamorak, said</a>
<a id='line_4439'>Sir Tristram, it was over great pity, for I dare say he was the</a>
<a id='line_4440'>cleanest mighted man and the best winded of his age that was alive; for</a>
<a id='line_4441'>I knew him that he was the biggest knight that ever I met withal, but</a>
<a id='line_4442'>if it were Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir Tristram, full woe is me for</a>
<a id='line_4443'>his death. And if they were not the cousins of my lord Arthur that slew</a>
<a id='line_4444'>him, they should die for it, and all those that were consenting to his</a>
<a id='line_4445'>death. And for such things, said Sir Tristram, I fear to draw unto the</a>
<a id='line_4446'>court of my lord Arthur; I will that ye wit it, said Sir Tristram unto</a>
<a id='line_4447'>Gareth.</a>
<a id='line_4448'></a>
<a id='line_4449'>Sir, I blame you not, said Gareth, for well I understand the vengeance</a>
<a id='line_4450'>of my brethren Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Mordred. But as for</a>
<a id='line_4451'>me, said Sir Gareth, I meddle not of their matters, therefore there is</a>
<a id='line_4452'>none of them that loveth me. And for I understand they be murderers of</a>
<a id='line_4453'>good knights I left their company; and God would I had been by, said</a>
<a id='line_4454'>Gareth, when the noble knight, Sir Lamorak, was slain.</a>
<a id='line_4455'></a>
<a id='line_4456'>Now as Jesu be my help, said Sir Tristram, it is well said of you, for</a>
<a id='line_4457'>I had liefer than all the gold betwixt this and Rome I had been there.</a>
<a id='line_4458'></a>
<a id='line_4459'>Iwis, said Palomides, and so would I had been there, and yet had I</a>
<a id='line_4460'>never the degree at no jousts nor tournament thereas he was, but he put</a>
<a id='line_4461'>me to the worse, or on foot or on horseback; and that day that he was</a>
<a id='line_4462'>slain he did the most deeds of arms that ever I saw knight do in all my</a>
<a id='line_4463'>life days. And when him was given the degree by my lord Arthur, Sir</a>
<a id='line_4464'>Gawaine and his three brethren, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Sir Mordred,</a>
<a id='line_4465'>set upon Sir Lamorak in a privy place, and there they slew his horse.</a>
<a id='line_4466'>And so they fought with him on foot more than three hours, both before</a>
<a id='line_4467'>him and behind him; and Sir Mordred gave him his death wound behind him</a>
<a id='line_4468'>at his back, and all to-hew him: for one of his squires told me that</a>
<a id='line_4469'>saw it. Fie upon treason, said Sir Tristram, for it killeth my heart to</a>
<a id='line_4470'>hear this tale. So it doth mine, said Gareth; brethren as they be mine</a>
<a id='line_4471'>I shall never love them, nor draw in their fellowship for that deed.</a>
<a id='line_4472'></a>
<a id='line_4473'>Now speak we of other deeds, said Palomides, and let him be, for his</a>
<a id='line_4474'>life ye may not get again. That is the more pity, said Dinadan, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_4475'>Gawaine and his brethren, except you Sir Gareth, hate all the good</a>
<a id='line_4476'>knights of the Round Table for the most part; for well I wot an they</a>
<a id='line_4477'>might privily, they hate my lord Sir Launcelot and all his kin, and</a>
<a id='line_4478'>great privy despite they have at him; and that is my lord Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_4479'>well ware of, and that causeth him to have the good knights of his kin</a>
<a id='line_4480'>about him.</a>
<a id='line_4481'></a>
<a id='line_4482'></a>
<a id='line_4483'></a>
<a id='line_4484'></a>
<a id='line_4485'>CHAPTER LIX. How they came to Humber bank, and how they found a ship</a>
<a id='line_4486'>there, wherein lay the body of King Hermance.</a>
<a id='line_4487'></a>
<a id='line_4488'></a>
<a id='line_4489'>Sir, said Palomides, let us leave of this matter, and let us see how we</a>
<a id='line_4490'>shall do at this tournament. By mine advice, said Palomides, let us</a>
<a id='line_4491'>four hold together against all that will come. Not by my counsel, said</a>
<a id='line_4492'>Sir Tristram, for I see by their pavilions there will be four hundred</a>
<a id='line_4493'>knights, and doubt ye not, said Sir Tristram, but there will be many</a>
<a id='line_4494'>good knights; and be a man never so valiant nor so big, yet he may be</a>
<a id='line_4495'>overmatched. And so have I seen knights done many times; and when they</a>
<a id='line_4496'>weened best to have won worship they lost it, for manhood is not worth</a>
<a id='line_4497'>but if it be medled with wisdom. And as for me, said Sir Tristram, it</a>
<a id='line_4498'>may happen I shall keep mine own head as well as another.</a>
<a id='line_4499'></a>
<a id='line_4500'>So thus they rode until that they came to Humber bank, where they heard</a>
<a id='line_4501'>a cry and a doleful noise. Then were they ware in the wind where came a</a>
<a id='line_4502'>rich vessel hilled over with red silk, and the vessel landed fast by</a>
<a id='line_4503'>them. Therewith Sir Tristram alighted and his knights. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_4504'>Tristram went afore and entered into that vessel. And when he came</a>
<a id='line_4505'>within he saw a fair bed richly covered, and thereupon lay a dead</a>
<a id='line_4506'>seemly knight, all armed save the head, was all be-bled with deadly</a>
<a id='line_4507'>wounds upon him, the which seemed to be a passing good knight. How may</a>
<a id='line_4508'>this be, said Sir Tristram, that this knight is thus slain? Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_4509'>Tristram was ware of a letter in the dead knight’s hand. Master</a>
<a id='line_4510'>mariners, said Sir Tristram, what meaneth that letter? Sir, said they,</a>
<a id='line_4511'>in that letter ye shall hear and know how he was slain, and for what</a>
<a id='line_4512'>cause, and what was his name. But sir, said the mariners, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_4513'>that no man shall take that letter and read it but if he be a good</a>
<a id='line_4514'>knight, and that he will faithfully promise to revenge his death, else</a>
<a id='line_4515'>shall there be no knight see that letter open. Wit ye well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4516'>Tristram, that some of us may revenge his death as well as other, and</a>
<a id='line_4517'>if it be so as ye mariners say his death shall be revenged. And</a>
<a id='line_4518'>therewith Sir Tristram took the letter out of the knight’s hand, and it</a>
<a id='line_4519'>said thus: Hermance, king and lord of the Red City, I send unto all</a>
<a id='line_4520'>knights errant, recommending unto you noble knights of Arthur’s court.</a>
<a id='line_4521'>I beseech them all among them to find one knight that will fight for my</a>
<a id='line_4522'>sake with two brethren that I brought up of nought, and feloniously and</a>
<a id='line_4523'>traitorly they have slain me; wherefore I beseech one good knight to</a>
<a id='line_4524'>revenge my death. And he that revengeth my death I will that he have my</a>
<a id='line_4525'>Red City and all my castles.</a>
<a id='line_4526'></a>
<a id='line_4527'>Sir, said the mariners, wit ye well this king and knight that here</a>
<a id='line_4528'>lieth was a full worshipful man and of full great prowess, and full</a>
<a id='line_4529'>well he loved all manner knights errants. So God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4530'>Tristram, here is a piteous case, and full fain would I take this</a>
<a id='line_4531'>enterprise upon me; but I have made such a promise that needs I must be</a>
<a id='line_4532'>at this great tournament, or else I am shamed. For well I wot for my</a>
<a id='line_4533'>sake in especial my lord Arthur let make this jousts and tournament in</a>
<a id='line_4534'>this country; and well I wot that many worshipful people will be there</a>
<a id='line_4535'>at that tournament for to see me; therefore I fear me to take this</a>
<a id='line_4536'>enterprise upon me that I shall not come again by time to this jousts.</a>
<a id='line_4537'>Sir, said Palomides, I pray you give me this enterprise, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_4538'>see me achieve it worshipfully, other else I shall die in this quarrel.</a>
<a id='line_4539'>Well, said Sir Tristram, and this enterprise I give you, with this,</a>
<a id='line_4540'>that ye be with me at this tournament that shall be as this day seven</a>
<a id='line_4541'>night. Sir, said Palomides, I promise you that I shall be with you by</a>
<a id='line_4542'>that day if I be unslain or unmaimed.</a>
<a id='line_4543'></a>
<a id='line_4544'></a>
<a id='line_4545'></a>
<a id='line_4546'></a>
<a id='line_4547'>CHAPTER LX. How Sir Tristram with his fellowship came and were with an</a>
<a id='line_4548'>host which after fought with Sir Tristram; and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_4549'></a>
<a id='line_4550'></a>
<a id='line_4551'>Then departed Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Sir Dinadan, and left Sir</a>
<a id='line_4552'>Palomides in the vessel; and so Sir Tristram beheld the mariners how</a>
<a id='line_4553'>they sailed overlong Humber. And when Sir Palomides was out of their</a>
<a id='line_4554'>sight they took their horses and beheld about them. And then were they</a>
<a id='line_4555'>ware of a knight that came riding against them unarmed, and nothing</a>
<a id='line_4556'>about him but a sword. And when this knight came nigh them he saluted</a>
<a id='line_4557'>them, and they him again. Fair knights, said that knight, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_4558'>insomuch as ye be knights errant, that ye will come and see my castle,</a>
<a id='line_4559'>and take such as ye find there; I pray you heartily. And so they rode</a>
<a id='line_4560'>with him until his castle, and there they were brought into the hall,</a>
<a id='line_4561'>that was well apparelled; and so they were there unarmed, and set at a</a>
<a id='line_4562'>board; and when this knight saw Sir Tristram, anon he knew him. And</a>
<a id='line_4563'>then this knight waxed pale and wroth at Sir Tristram. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_4564'>Tristram saw his host make such cheer he marvelled and said: Sir, mine</a>
<a id='line_4565'>host, what cheer make you? Wit thou well, said he, I fare the worse for</a>
<a id='line_4566'>thee, for I know thee, Sir Tristram de Liones, thou slewest my brother;</a>
<a id='line_4567'>and therefore I give thee summons I will slay thee an ever I may get</a>
<a id='line_4568'>thee at large. Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I am never advised that</a>
<a id='line_4569'>ever I slew any brother of yours; and if ye say that I did I will make</a>
<a id='line_4570'>amends unto my power. I will none amends, said the knight, but keep</a>
<a id='line_4571'>thee from me.</a>
<a id='line_4572'></a>
<a id='line_4573'>So when he had dined Sir Tristram asked his arms, and departed. And so</a>
<a id='line_4574'>they rode on their ways, and within a while Sir Dinadan saw where came</a>
<a id='line_4575'>a knight well armed and well horsed, without shield. Sir Tristram, said</a>
<a id='line_4576'>Sir Dinadan, take keep to yourself, for I dare undertake yonder cometh</a>
<a id='line_4577'>your host that will have ado with you. Let him come, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_4578'>I shall abide him as well as I may. Anon the knight, when he came nigh</a>
<a id='line_4579'>Sir Tristram, he cried and bade him abide and keep him. So they hurtled</a>
<a id='line_4580'>together, but Sir Tristram smote the other knight so sore that he bare</a>
<a id='line_4581'>him over his horse’s croup. That knight arose lightly and took his</a>
<a id='line_4582'>horse again, and so rode fiercely to Sir Tristram, and smote him twice</a>
<a id='line_4583'>hard upon the helm. Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I pray you leave off</a>
<a id='line_4584'>and smite me no more, for I would be loath to deal with you an I might</a>
<a id='line_4585'>choose, for I have your meat and your drink within my body. For all</a>
<a id='line_4586'>that he would not leave; and then Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet</a>
<a id='line_4587'>upon the helm that he fell up-so-down from his horse, that the blood</a>
<a id='line_4588'>brast out at the ventails of his helm, and so he lay still likely to be</a>
<a id='line_4589'>dead. Then Sir Tristram said: Me repenteth of this buffet that I smote</a>
<a id='line_4590'>so sore, for as I suppose he is dead. And so they left him and rode on</a>
<a id='line_4591'>their ways.</a>
<a id='line_4592'></a>
<a id='line_4593'>So they had not ridden but a while, but they saw riding against them</a>
<a id='line_4594'>two full likely knights, well armed and well horsed, and goodly</a>
<a id='line_4595'>servants about them. The one was Berrant le Apres, and he was called</a>
<a id='line_4596'>the King with the Hundred Knights; and the other was Sir Segwarides,</a>
<a id='line_4597'>which were renowned two noble knights. So as they came either by other</a>
<a id='line_4598'>the king looked upon Sir Dinadan, that at that time he had Sir</a>
<a id='line_4599'>Tristram’s helm upon his shoulder, the which helm the king had seen</a>
<a id='line_4600'>to-fore with the Queen of Northgalis, and that queen the king loved as</a>
<a id='line_4601'>paramour; and that helm the Queen of Northgalis had given to La Beale</a>
<a id='line_4602'>Isoud, and the queen La Beale Isoud gave it to Sir Tristram. Sir</a>
<a id='line_4603'>knight, said Berrant, where had ye that helm? What would ye? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4604'>Dinadan. For I will have ado with thee, said the king, for the love of</a>
<a id='line_4605'>her that owed that helm, and therefore keep you. So they departed and</a>
<a id='line_4606'>came together with all their mights of their horses, and there the King</a>
<a id='line_4607'>with the Hundred Knights smote Sir Dinadan, horse and all, to the</a>
<a id='line_4608'>earth; and then he commanded his servant: Go and take thou his helm</a>
<a id='line_4609'>off, and keep it. So the varlet went to unbuckle his helm. What helm,</a>
<a id='line_4610'>what wilt thou do? said Sir Tristram, leave that helm. To what intent,</a>
<a id='line_4611'>said the king, will ye, sir knight, meddle with that helm? Wit you</a>
<a id='line_4612'>well, said Sir Tristram, that helm shall not depart from me or it be</a>
<a id='line_4613'>dearer bought. Then make you ready, said Sir Berrant unto Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_4614'>So they hurtled together, and there Sir Tristram smote him down over</a>
<a id='line_4615'>his horse’s tail; and then the king arose lightly, and gat his horse</a>
<a id='line_4616'>lightly again. And then he struck fiercely at Sir Tristram many great</a>
<a id='line_4617'>strokes. And then Sir Tristram gave Sir Berrant such a buffet upon the</a>
<a id='line_4618'>helm that he fell down over his horse sore stonied. Lo, said Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_4619'>that helm is unhappy to us twain, for I had a fall for it, and now, sir</a>
<a id='line_4620'>king, have ye another fall.</a>
<a id='line_4621'></a>
<a id='line_4622'>Then Segwarides asked: Who shall joust with me? I pray thee, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4623'>Gareth unto Dinadan, let me have this jousts. Sir, said Dinadan, I pray</a>
<a id='line_4624'>you take it as for me. That is no reason, said Tristram, for this</a>
<a id='line_4625'>jousts should be yours. At a word, said Dinadan, I will not thereof.</a>
<a id='line_4626'>Then Gareth dressed him to Sir Segwarides, and there Sir Segwarides</a>
<a id='line_4627'>smote Gareth and his horse to the earth. Now, said Sir Tristram to</a>
<a id='line_4628'>Dinadan, joust with yonder knight. I will not thereof, said Dinadan.</a>
<a id='line_4629'>Then will I, said Sir Tristram. And then Sir Tristram ran to him, and</a>
<a id='line_4630'>gave him a fall; and so they left them on foot, and Sir Tristram rode</a>
<a id='line_4631'>unto Joyous Gard, and there Sir Gareth would not of his courtesy have</a>
<a id='line_4632'>gone into this castle, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him to depart.</a>
<a id='line_4633'>And so they alighted and unarmed them, and had great cheer. But when</a>
<a id='line_4634'>Dinadan came afore La Beale Isoud he cursed the time that ever he bare</a>
<a id='line_4635'>Sir Tristram’s helm, and there he told her how Sir Tristram had mocked</a>
<a id='line_4636'>him. Then was there laughing and japing at Sir Dinadan, that they wist</a>
<a id='line_4637'>not what to do with him.</a>
<a id='line_4638'></a>
<a id='line_4639'></a>
<a id='line_4640'></a>
<a id='line_4641'></a>
<a id='line_4642'>CHAPTER LXI. How Palomides went for to fight with two brethren for the</a>
<a id='line_4643'>death of King Hermance.</a>
<a id='line_4644'></a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>
<a id='line_4646'>Now will we leave them merry within Joyous Gard, and speak we of Sir</a>
<a id='line_4647'>Palomides. Then Sir Palomides sailed evenlong Humber to the coasts of</a>
<a id='line_4648'>the sea, where was a fair castle. And at that time it was early in the</a>
<a id='line_4649'>morning, afore day. Then the mariners went unto Sir Palomides that</a>
<a id='line_4650'>slept fast. Sir knight, said the mariners, ye must arise, for here is a</a>
<a id='line_4651'>castle there ye must go into. I assent me, said Sir Palomides; and</a>
<a id='line_4652'>therewithal he arrived. And then he blew his horn that the mariners had</a>
<a id='line_4653'>given him. And when they within the castle heard that horn they put</a>
<a id='line_4654'>forth many knights; and there they stood upon the walls, and said with</a>
<a id='line_4655'>one voice: Welcome be ye to this castle. And then it waxed clear day,</a>
<a id='line_4656'>and Sir Palomides entered into the castle. And within a while he was</a>
<a id='line_4657'>served with many divers meats. Then Sir Palomides heard about him much</a>
<a id='line_4658'>weeping and great dole. What may this mean? said Sir Palomides; I love</a>
<a id='line_4659'>not to hear such a sorrow, and fain I would know what it meaneth. Then</a>
<a id='line_4660'>there came afore him one whose name was Sir Ebel, that said thus: Wit</a>
<a id='line_4661'>ye well, sir knight, this dole and sorrow is here made every day, and</a>
<a id='line_4662'>for this cause: we had a king that hight Hermance, and he was King of</a>
<a id='line_4663'>the Red City, and this king that was lord was a noble knight, large and</a>
<a id='line_4664'>liberal of his expense; and in the world he loved nothing so much as he</a>
<a id='line_4665'>did errant knights of King Arthur’s court, and all jousting, hunting,</a>
<a id='line_4666'>and all manner of knightly games; for so kind a king and knight had</a>
<a id='line_4667'>never the rule of poor people as he was; and because of his goodness</a>
<a id='line_4668'>and gentleness we bemoan him, and ever shall. And all kings and</a>
<a id='line_4669'>estates may beware by our lord, for he was destroyed in his own</a>
<a id='line_4670'>default; for had he cherished them of his blood he had yet lived with</a>
<a id='line_4671'>great riches and rest: but all estates may beware by our king. But</a>
<a id='line_4672'>alas, said Ebel, that we shall give all other warning by his death.</a>
<a id='line_4673'></a>
<a id='line_4674'>Tell me, said Palomides, and in what manner was your lord slain, and by</a>
<a id='line_4675'>whom. Sir, said Sir Ebel, our king brought up of children two men that</a>
<a id='line_4676'>now are perilous knights; and these two knights our king had so in</a>
<a id='line_4677'>charity, that he loved no man nor trusted no man of his blood, nor none</a>
<a id='line_4678'>other that was about him. And by these two knights our king was</a>
<a id='line_4679'>governed, and so they ruled him peaceably and his lands, and never</a>
<a id='line_4680'>would they suffer none of his blood to have no rule with our king. And</a>
<a id='line_4681'>also he was so free and so gentle, and they so false and deceivable,</a>
<a id='line_4682'>that they ruled him peaceably; and that espied the lords of our king’s</a>
<a id='line_4683'>blood, and departed from him unto their own livelihood. Then when these</a>
<a id='line_4684'>two traitors understood that they had driven all the lords of his blood</a>
<a id='line_4685'>from him, they were not pleased with that rule, but then they thought</a>
<a id='line_4686'>to have more, as ever it is an old saw: Give a churl rule and thereby</a>
<a id='line_4687'>he will not be sufficed; for whatsomever he be that is ruled by a</a>
<a id='line_4688'>villain born, and the lord of the soil to be a gentleman born, the same</a>
<a id='line_4689'>villain shall destroy all the gentlemen about him: therefore all</a>
<a id='line_4690'>estates and lords, beware whom ye take about you. And if ye be a knight</a>
<a id='line_4691'>of King Arthur’s court remember this tale, for this is the end and</a>
<a id='line_4692'>conclusion. My lord and king rode unto the forest hereby by the advice</a>
<a id='line_4693'>of these traitors, and there he chased at the red deer, armed at all</a>
<a id='line_4694'>pieces full like a good knight; and so for labour he waxed dry, and</a>
<a id='line_4695'>then he alighted, and drank at a well. And when he was alighted, by the</a>
<a id='line_4696'>assent of these two traitors, that one that hight Helius he suddenly</a>
<a id='line_4697'>smote our king through the body with a spear, and so they left him</a>
<a id='line_4698'>there. And when they were departed, then by fortune I came to the well,</a>
<a id='line_4699'>and found my lord and king wounded to the death. And when I heard his</a>
<a id='line_4700'>complaint, I let bring him to the water side, and in that same ship I</a>
<a id='line_4701'>put him alive; and when my lord King Hermance was in that vessel, he</a>
<a id='line_4702'>required me for the true faith I owed unto him for to write a letter in</a>
<a id='line_4703'>this manner.</a>
<a id='line_4704'></a>
<a id='line_4705'></a>
<a id='line_4706'></a>
<a id='line_4707'></a>
<a id='line_4708'>CHAPTER LXII. The copy of the letter written for to revenge the king’s</a>
<a id='line_4709'>death, and how Sir Palomides fought for to have the battle.</a>
<a id='line_4710'></a>
<a id='line_4711'></a>
<a id='line_4712'>Recommending unto King Arthur and to all his knights errant, beseeching</a>
<a id='line_4713'>them all that insomuch as I, King Hermance, King of the Red City, thus</a>
<a id='line_4714'>am slain by felony and treason, through two knights of mine own, and of</a>
<a id='line_4715'>mine own bringing up and of mine own making, that some worshipful</a>
<a id='line_4716'>knight will revenge my death, insomuch I have been ever to my power</a>
<a id='line_4717'>well willing unto Arthur’s court. And who that will adventure his life</a>
<a id='line_4718'>with these two traitors for my sake in one battle, I, King Hermance,</a>
<a id='line_4719'>King of the Red City, freely give him all my lands and rents that ever</a>
<a id='line_4720'>I wielded in my life. This letter, said Ebel, I wrote by my lord’s</a>
<a id='line_4721'>commandment, and then he received his Creator; and when he was dead, he</a>
<a id='line_4722'>commanded me or ever he were cold to put that letter fast in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_4723'>And then he commanded me to put forth that same vessel down Humber, and</a>
<a id='line_4724'>I should give these mariners in commandment never to stint until that</a>
<a id='line_4725'>they came unto Logris, where all the noble knights shall assemble at</a>
<a id='line_4726'>this time. And there shall some good knight have pity on me to revenge</a>
<a id='line_4727'>my death, for there was never king nor lord falslier nor traitorlier</a>
<a id='line_4728'>slain than I am here to my death. Thus was the complaint of our King</a>
<a id='line_4729'>Hermance. Now, said Sir Ebel, ye know all how our lord was betrayed, we</a>
<a id='line_4730'>require you for God’s sake have pity upon his death, and worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_4731'>revenge his death, and then may ye wield all these lands. For we all</a>
<a id='line_4732'>wit well that an ye may slay these two traitors, the Red City and all</a>
<a id='line_4733'>those that be therein will take you for their lord.</a>
<a id='line_4734'></a>
<a id='line_4735'>Truly, said Sir Palomides, it grieveth my heart for to hear you tell</a>
<a id='line_4736'>this doleful tale; and to say the truth I saw the same letter that ye</a>
<a id='line_4737'>speak of, and one of the best knights on the earth read that letter to</a>
<a id='line_4738'>me, and by his commandment I came hither to revenge your king’s death;</a>
<a id='line_4739'>and therefore have done, and let me wit where I shall find those</a>
<a id='line_4740'>traitors, for I shall never be at ease in my heart till I be in hands</a>
<a id='line_4741'>with them. Sir, said Sir Ebel, then take your ship again, and that ship</a>
<a id='line_4742'>must bring you unto the Delectable Isle, fast by the Red City, and we</a>
<a id='line_4743'>in this castle shall pray for you, and abide your again-coming. For</a>
<a id='line_4744'>this same castle, an ye speed well, must needs be yours; for our King</a>
<a id='line_4745'>Hermance let make this castle for the love of the two traitors, and so</a>
<a id='line_4746'>we kept it with strong hand, and therefore full sore are we threated.</a>
<a id='line_4747'>Wot ye what ye shall do, said Sir Palomides; whatsomever come of me,</a>
<a id='line_4748'>look ye keep well this castle. For an it misfortune me so to be slain</a>
<a id='line_4749'>in this quest I am sure there will come one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_4750'>world for to revenge my death, and that is Sir Tristram de Liones, or</a>
<a id='line_4751'>else Sir Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_4752'></a>
<a id='line_4753'>Then Sir Palomides departed from that castle. And as he came nigh the</a>
<a id='line_4754'>city, there came out of a ship a goodly knight armed against him, with</a>
<a id='line_4755'>his shield on his shoulder, and his hand upon his sword. And anon as he</a>
<a id='line_4756'>came nigh Sir Palomides he said: Sir knight, what seek ye here? leave</a>
<a id='line_4757'>this quest for it is mine, and mine it was or ever it was yours, and</a>
<a id='line_4758'>therefore I will have it. Sir knight, said Palomides, it may well be</a>
<a id='line_4759'>that this quest was yours or it was mine, but when the letter was taken</a>
<a id='line_4760'>out of the dead king’s hand, at that time by likelihood there was no</a>
<a id='line_4761'>knight had undertaken to revenge the death of the king. And so at that</a>
<a id='line_4762'>time I promised to revenge his death, and so I shall or else I am</a>
<a id='line_4763'>ashamed. Ye say well, said the knight, but wit ye well then will I</a>
<a id='line_4764'>fight with you, and who be the better knight of us both, let him take</a>
<a id='line_4765'>the battle upon hand. I assent me, said Sir Palomides. And then they</a>
<a id='line_4766'>dressed their shields, and pulled out their swords, and lashed together</a>
<a id='line_4767'>many sad strokes as men of might; and this fighting was more than an</a>
<a id='line_4768'>hour, but at the last Sir Palomides waxed big and better winded, so</a>
<a id='line_4769'>that then he smote that knight such a stroke that he made him to kneel</a>
<a id='line_4770'>upon his knees. Then that knight spake on high and said: Gentle knight,</a>
<a id='line_4771'>hold thy hand. Sir Palomides was goodly and withdrew his hand. Then</a>
<a id='line_4772'>this knight said: Wit ye well, knight, that thou art better worthy to</a>
<a id='line_4773'>have this battle than I, and require thee of knighthood tell me thy</a>
<a id='line_4774'>name. Sir, my name is Palomides, a knight of King Arthur’s, and of the</a>
<a id='line_4775'>Table Round, that hither I came to revenge the death of this dead king.</a>

<a id='line_4782'></a>
<a id='line_4783'></a>
<a id='line_4784'>Well be ye found, said the knight to Palomides, for of all knights that</a>
<a id='line_4785'>be alive, except three, I had liefest have you. The first is Sir</a>
<a id='line_4786'>Launcelot du Lake, and Sir Tristram de Liones, the third is my nigh</a>

<a id='line_4789'>and ye shall see how I shall speed; and if I be there slain go ye to my</a>
<a id='line_4790'>lord Sir Launcelot, or else to my lord Sir Tristram, and pray them to</a>
<a id='line_4791'>revenge my death, for as for Sir Lamorak him shall ye never see in this</a>
<a id='line_4792'>world. Alas, said Sir Hermind, how may that be? He is slain, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4793'>Palomides, by Sir Gawaine and his brethren. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_4794'>Hermind, there was not one for one that slew him. That is truth, said</a>
<a id='line_4795'>Sir Palomides, for they were four dangerous knights that slew him, as</a>
<a id='line_4796'>Sir Gawaine, Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_4797'>Gareth, the fifth brother was away, the best knight of them all. And so</a>
<a id='line_4798'>Sir Palomides told Hermind all the manner, and how they slew Sir</a>
<a id='line_4799'>Lamorak all only by treason.</a>
<a id='line_4800'></a>
<a id='line_4801'>So Sir Palomides took his ship, and arrived up at the Delectable Isle.</a>
<a id='line_4802'>And in the meanwhile Sir Hermind that was the king’s brother, he</a>
<a id='line_4803'>arrived up at the Red City, and there he told them how there was come a</a>
<a id='line_4804'>knight of King Arthur’s to avenge King Hermance’s death: And his name</a>
<a id='line_4805'>is Sir Palomides, the good knight, that for the most part he followeth</a>
<a id='line_4806'>the beast Glatisant. Then all the city made great joy, for mickle had</a>
<a id='line_4807'>they heard of Sir Palomides, and of his noble prowess. So let they</a>
<a id='line_4808'>ordain a messenger, and sent unto the two brethren, and bade them to</a>
<a id='line_4809'>make them ready, for there was a knight come that would fight with them</a>
<a id='line_4810'>both. So the messenger went unto them where they were at a castle there</a>
<a id='line_4811'>beside; and there he told them how there was a knight come of King</a>
<a id='line_4812'>Arthur’s court to fight with them both at once. He is welcome, said</a>
<a id='line_4813'>they; but tell us, we pray you, if it be Sir Launcelot or any of his</a>
<a id='line_4814'>blood? He is none of that blood, said the messenger. Then we care the</a>
<a id='line_4815'>less, said the two brethren, for with none of the blood of Sir</a>
<a id='line_4816'>Launcelot we keep not to have ado withal. Wit ye well, said the</a>
<a id='line_4817'>messenger, that his name is Sir Palomides, that yet is unchristened, a</a>
<a id='line_4818'>noble knight. Well, said they, an he be now unchristened he shall never</a>
<a id='line_4819'>be christened. So they appointed to be at the city within two days.</a>
<a id='line_4820'></a>
<a id='line_4821'>And when Sir Palomides was come to the city they made passing great joy</a>
<a id='line_4822'>of him, and then they beheld him, and saw that he was well made,</a>
<a id='line_4823'>cleanly and bigly, and unmaimed of his limbs, and neither too young nor</a>
<a id='line_4824'>too old. And so all the people praised him; and though he was not</a>
<a id='line_4825'>christened yet he believed in the best manner, and was full faithful</a>
<a id='line_4826'>and true of his promise, and well conditioned; and because he made his</a>
<a id='line_4827'>avow that he would never be christened unto the time that he had</a>
<a id='line_4828'>achieved the beast Glatisant, the which was a full wonderful beast, and</a>
<a id='line_4829'>a great signification; for Merlin prophesied much of that beast. And</a>
<a id='line_4830'>also Sir Palomides avowed never to take full christendom unto the time</a>
<a id='line_4831'>that he had done seven battles within the lists.</a>
<a id='line_4832'></a>
<a id='line_4833'>So within the third day there came to the city these two brethren, the</a>
<a id='line_4834'>one hight Helius, the other hight Helake, the which were men of great</a>
<a id='line_4835'>prowess; howbeit that they were false and full of treason, and but poor</a>
<a id='line_4836'>men born, yet were they noble knights of their hands. And with them</a>
<a id='line_4837'>they brought forty knights, to that intent that they should be big</a>
<a id='line_4838'>enough for the Red City. Thus came the two brethren with great bobaunce</a>
<a id='line_4839'>and pride, for they had put the Red City in fear and damage. Then they</a>
<a id='line_4840'>were brought to the lists, and Sir Palomides came into the place and</a>
<a id='line_4841'>said thus: Be ye the two brethren, Helius and Helake, that slew your</a>
<a id='line_4842'>king and lord, Sir Hermance, by felony and treason, for whom that I am</a>
<a id='line_4843'>come hither to revenge his death? Wit thou well, said Sir Helius and</a>
<a id='line_4844'>Sir Helake, that we are the same knights that slew King Hermance; and</a>
<a id='line_4845'>wit thou well, Sir Palomides Saracen, that we shall handle thee so or</a>
<a id='line_4846'>thou depart that thou shalt wish that thou wert christened. It may well</a>
<a id='line_4847'>be, said Sir Palomides, for yet I would not die or I were christened;</a>
<a id='line_4848'>and yet so am I not afeard of you both, but I trust to God that I shall</a>
<a id='line_4849'>die a better christian man than any of you both; and doubt ye not, said</a>
<a id='line_4850'>Sir Palomides, either ye or I shall be left dead in this place.</a>
<a id='line_4851'></a>
<a id='line_4852'></a>
<a id='line_4853'></a>
<a id='line_4854'></a>
<a id='line_4855'>CHAPTER LXIV. Of the battle between Sir Palomides and the two brethren,</a>
<a id='line_4856'>and how the two brethren were slain.</a>
<a id='line_4857'></a>
<a id='line_4858'></a>
<a id='line_4859'>Then they departed, and the two brethren came against Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_4860'>and he against them, as fast as their horses might run. And by fortune</a>
<a id='line_4861'>Sir Palomides smote Helake through his shield and through the breast</a>
<a id='line_4862'>more than a fathom. All this while Sir Helius held up his spear, and</a>
<a id='line_4863'>for pride and orgulité he would not smite Sir Palomides with his spear;</a>
<a id='line_4864'>but when he saw his brother lie on the earth, and saw he might not help</a>
<a id='line_4865'>himself, then he said unto Sir Palomides: Help thyself. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_4866'>he came hurtling unto Sir Palomides with his spear, and smote him quite</a>
<a id='line_4867'>from his saddle. Then Sir Helius rode over Sir Palomides twice or</a>
<a id='line_4868'>thrice. And therewith Sir Palomides was ashamed, and gat the horse of</a>
<a id='line_4869'>Sir Helius by the bridle, and therewithal the horse areared, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_4870'>Palomides halp after, and so they fell both to the earth; but anon Sir</a>
<a id='line_4871'>Helius stert up lightly, and there he smote Sir Palomides a great</a>
<a id='line_4872'>stroke upon the helm, that he kneeled upon his own knee. Then they</a>
<a id='line_4873'>lashed together many sad strokes, and traced and traversed now</a>
<a id='line_4874'>backward, now sideling, hurtling together like two boars, and that same</a>
<a id='line_4875'>time they fell both grovelling to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_4876'></a>
<a id='line_4877'>Thus they fought still without any reposing two hours, and never</a>
<a id='line_4878'>breathed; and then Sir Palomides waxed faint and weary, and Sir Helius</a>
<a id='line_4879'>waxed passing strong, and doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_4880'>overthwart and endlong all the field, that they of the city when they</a>
<a id='line_4881'>saw Sir Palomides in this case they wept and cried, and made great</a>
<a id='line_4882'>dole, and the other party made as great joy. Alas, said the men of the</a>
<a id='line_4883'>city, that this noble knight should thus be slain for our king’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_4884'>And as they were thus weeping and crying, Sir Palomides that had</a>
<a id='line_4885'>suffered an hundred strokes, that it was wonder that he stood on his</a>
<a id='line_4886'>feet, at the last Sir Palomides beheld as he might the common people,</a>
<a id='line_4887'>how they wept for him; and then he said to himself: Ah, fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_4888'>Sir Palomides, why hangest thou thy head so low; and therewith he bare</a>
<a id='line_4889'>up his shield, and looked Sir Helius in the visage, and he smote him a</a>
<a id='line_4890'>great stroke upon the helm, and after that another and another. And</a>
<a id='line_4891'>then he smote Sir Helius with such a might that he fell to the earth</a>
<a id='line_4892'>grovelling; and then he raced off his helm from his head, and there he</a>
<a id='line_4893'>smote him such a buffet that he departed his head from the body. And</a>
<a id='line_4894'>then were the people of the city the joyfullest people that might be.</a>
<a id='line_4895'>So they brought him to his lodging with great solemnity, and there all</a>
<a id='line_4896'>the people became his men. And then Sir Palomides prayed them all to</a>
<a id='line_4897'>take keep unto all the lordship of King Hermance: For, fair sirs, wit</a>
<a id='line_4898'>ye well I may not as at this time abide with you, for I must in all</a>
<a id='line_4899'>haste be with my lord King Arthur at the Castle of Lonazep, the which I</a>
<a id='line_4900'>have promised. Then was the people full heavy at his departing, for all</a>
<a id='line_4901'>that city proffered Sir Palomides the third part of their goods so that</a>
<a id='line_4902'>he would abide with them; but in no wise as at that time he would not</a>
<a id='line_4903'>abide.</a>
<a id='line_4904'></a>
<a id='line_4905'>And so Sir Palomides departed, and so he came unto the castle thereas</a>
<a id='line_4906'>Sir Ebel was lieutenant. And when they in the castle wist how Sir</a>
<a id='line_4907'>Palomides had sped, there was a joyful meiny; and so Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_4908'>departed, and came to the castle of Lonazep. And when he wist that Sir</a>
<a id='line_4909'>Tristram was not there he took his way over Humber, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_4910'>Joyous Gard, whereas Sir Tristram was and La Beale Isoud. Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_4911'>had commanded that what knight errant came within the Joyous Gard, as</a>
<a id='line_4912'>in the town, that they should warn Sir Tristram. So there came a man of</a>
<a id='line_4913'>the town, and told Sir Tristram how there was a knight in the town, a</a>
<a id='line_4914'>passing goodly man. What manner of man is he, said Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_4915'>what sign beareth he? So the man told Sir Tristram all the tokens of</a>
<a id='line_4916'>him. That is Palomides, said Dinadan. It may well be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4917'>Tristram. Go ye to him, said Sir Tristram unto Dinadan. So Dinadan went</a>
<a id='line_4918'>unto Sir Palomides, and there either made other great joy, and so they</a>
<a id='line_4919'>lay together that night. And on the morn early came Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_4920'>Sir Gareth, and took them in their beds, and so they arose and brake</a>
<a id='line_4921'>their fast.</a>
<a id='line_4922'></a>
<a id='line_4923'></a>
<a id='line_4924'></a>
<a id='line_4925'></a>
<a id='line_4926'>CHAPTER LXV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides met Breuse Saunce Pité,</a>
<a id='line_4927'>and how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud went unto Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_4928'></a>
<a id='line_4929'></a>
<a id='line_4930'>And then Sir Tristram desired Sir Palomides to ride into the fields and</a>
<a id='line_4931'>woods. So they were accorded to repose them in the forest. And when</a>
<a id='line_4932'>they had played them a great while they rode unto a fair well; and anon</a>
<a id='line_4933'>they were ware of an armed knight that came riding against them, and</a>
<a id='line_4934'>there either saluted other. Then this armed knight spake to Sir</a>
<a id='line_4935'>Tristram, and asked what were these knights that were lodged in Joyous</a>
<a id='line_4936'>Gard. I wot not what they are, said Sir Tristram. What knights be ye?</a>
<a id='line_4937'>said that knight, for meseemeth ye be no knights errant, because ye</a>
<a id='line_4938'>ride unarmed. Whether we be knights or not we list not to tell thee our</a>
<a id='line_4939'>name. Wilt thou not tell me thy name? said that knight; then keep thee,</a>
<a id='line_4940'>for thou shalt die of my hands. And therewith he got his spear in his</a>
<a id='line_4941'>hands, and would have run Sir Tristram through. That saw Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_4942'>and smote his horse traverse in midst of the side, that man and horse</a>
<a id='line_4943'>fell to the earth. And therewith Sir Palomides alighted and pulled out</a>
<a id='line_4944'>his sword to have slain him. Let be, said Sir Tristram, slay him not,</a>
<a id='line_4945'>the knight is but a fool, it were shame to slay him. But take away his</a>
<a id='line_4946'>spear, said Sir Tristram, and let him take his horse and go where that</a>
<a id='line_4947'>he will.</a>
<a id='line_4948'></a>
<a id='line_4949'>So when this knight arose he groaned sore of the fall, and so he took</a>
<a id='line_4950'>his horse, and when he was up he turned then his horse, and required</a>
<a id='line_4951'>Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides to tell him what knights they were. Now</a>
<a id='line_4952'>wit ye well, said Sir Tristram, that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones,</a>
<a id='line_4953'>and this knight’s name is Sir Palomides. When he wist what they were he</a>
<a id='line_4954'>took his horse with the spurs, because they should not ask him his</a>
<a id='line_4955'>name, and so rode fast away through thick and thin. Then came there by</a>
<a id='line_4956'>them a knight with a bended shield of azure, whose name was Epinogris,</a>
<a id='line_4957'>and he came toward them a great wallop. Whither are ye riding? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4958'>Tristram. My fair lords, said Epinogris, I follow the falsest knight</a>
<a id='line_4959'>that beareth the life; wherefore I require you tell me whether ye saw</a>
<a id='line_4960'>him, for he beareth a shield with a case of red over it. So God me</a>
<a id='line_4961'>help, said Tristram, such a knight departed from us not a quarter of an</a>
<a id='line_4962'>hour agone; we pray you tell us his name. Alas, said Epinogris, why let</a>
<a id='line_4963'>ye him escape from you? and he is so great a foe unto all errant</a>
<a id='line_4964'>knights: his name is Breuse Saunce Pité. Ah, fie for shame, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4965'>Palomides, alas that ever he escaped mine hands, for he is the man in</a>
<a id='line_4966'>the world that I hate most. Then every knight made great sorrow to</a>
<a id='line_4967'>other; and so Epinogris departed and followed the chase after him.</a>
<a id='line_4968'></a>
<a id='line_4969'>Then Sir Tristram and his three fellows rode unto Joyous Gard; and</a>
<a id='line_4970'>there Sir Tristram talked unto Sir Palomides of his battle, how he sped</a>
<a id='line_4971'>at the Red City, and as ye have heard afore so was it ended. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_4972'>said Sir Tristram, I am glad ye have well sped, for ye have done</a>
<a id='line_4973'>worshipfully. Well, said Sir Tristram, we must forward to-morn. And</a>
<a id='line_4974'>then he devised how it should be; and Sir Tristram devised to send his</a>
<a id='line_4975'>two pavilions to set them fast by the well of Lonazep, and therein</a>
<a id='line_4976'>shall be the queen La Beale Isoud. It is well said, said Sir Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_4977'>but when Sir Palomides heard of that his heart was ravished out of</a>
<a id='line_4978'>measure: notwithstanding he said but little. So when they came to</a>
<a id='line_4979'>Joyous Gard Sir Palomides would not have gone into the castle, but as</a>
<a id='line_4980'>Sir Tristram took him by the finger, and led him into the castle. And</a>
<a id='line_4981'>when Sir Palomides saw La Beale Isoud he was ravished so that he might</a>
<a id='line_4982'>unnethe speak. So they went unto meat, but Palomides might not eat, and</a>
<a id='line_4983'>there was all the cheer that might be had. And on the morn they were</a>
<a id='line_4984'>apparelled to ride toward Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_4985'></a>
<a id='line_4986'>So Sir Tristram had three squires, and La Beale Isoud had three</a>
<a id='line_4987'>gentlewomen, and both the queen and they were richly apparelled; and</a>
<a id='line_4988'>other people had they none with them, but varlets to bear their shields</a>
<a id='line_4989'>and their spears. And thus they rode forth. So as they rode they saw</a>
<a id='line_4990'>afore them a rout of knights; it was the knight Galihodin with twenty</a>
<a id='line_4991'>knights with him. Fair fellows, said Galihodin, yonder come four</a>
<a id='line_4992'>knights, and a rich and a well fair lady: I am in will to take that</a>
<a id='line_4993'>lady from them. That is not of the best counsel, said one of</a>
<a id='line_4994'>Galihodin’s men, but send ye to them and wit what they will say; and so</a>
<a id='line_4995'>it was done. There came a squire unto Sir Tristram, and asked them</a>
<a id='line_4996'>whether they would joust or else to lose their lady. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_4997'>Tristram, tell your lord I bid him come as many as we be, and win her</a>
<a id='line_4998'>and take her. Sir, said Palomides, an it please you let me have this</a>
<a id='line_4999'>deed, and I shall undertake them all four. I will that ye have it, said</a>
<a id='line_5000'>Sir Tristram, at your pleasure. Now go and tell your lord Galihodin,</a>
<a id='line_5001'>that this same knight will encounter with him and his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_5002'></a>
<a id='line_5003'></a>
<a id='line_5004'></a>
<a id='line_5005'></a>
<a id='line_5006'>CHAPTER LXVI. How Sir Palomides jousted with Sir Galihodin, and after</a>
<a id='line_5007'>with Sir Gawaine, and smote them down.</a>
<a id='line_5008'></a>
<a id='line_5009'></a>
<a id='line_5010'>Then this squire departed and told Galihodin; and then he dressed his</a>
<a id='line_5011'>shield, and put forth a spear, and Sir Palomides another; and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_5012'>Palomides smote Galihodin so hard that he smote both horse and man to</a>
<a id='line_5013'>the earth. And there he had an horrible fall. And then came there</a>
<a id='line_5014'>another knight, and in the same wise he served him; and so he served</a>
<a id='line_5015'>the third and the fourth, that he smote them over their horses’ croups,</a>
<a id='line_5016'>and always Sir Palomides’ spear was whole. Then came six knights more</a>
<a id='line_5017'>of Galihodin’s men, and would have been avenged upon Sir Palomides. Let</a>
<a id='line_5018'>be, said Sir Galihodin, not so hardy, none of you all meddle with this</a>
<a id='line_5019'>knight, for he is a man of great bounté and honour, and if he would ye</a>
<a id='line_5020'>were not able to meddle with him. And right so they held them still.</a>
<a id='line_5021'>And ever Sir Palomides was ready to joust; and when he saw they would</a>
<a id='line_5022'>no more he rode unto Sir Tristram. Right well have ye done, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5023'>Tristram, and worshipfully have ye done as a good knight should. This</a>
<a id='line_5024'>Galihodin was nigh cousin unto Galahalt, the haut prince; and this</a>
<a id='line_5025'>Galihodin was a king within the country of Surluse.</a>
<a id='line_5026'></a>
<a id='line_5027'>So as Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and La Beale Isoud rode together</a>
<a id='line_5028'>they saw afore them four knights, and every man had his spear in his</a>
<a id='line_5029'>hand: the first was Sir Gawaine, the second Sir Uwaine, the third Sir</a>
<a id='line_5030'>Sagramore le Desirous, and the fourth was Dodinas le Savage. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_5031'>Palomides beheld them, that the four knights were ready to joust, he</a>
<a id='line_5032'>prayed Sir Tristram to give him leave to have ado with them all so long</a>
<a id='line_5033'>as he might hold him on horseback. And if that I be smitten down I pray</a>
<a id='line_5034'>you revenge me. Well, said Sir Tristram, I will as ye will, and ye are</a>
<a id='line_5035'>not so fain to have worship but I would as fain increase your worship.</a>
<a id='line_5036'>And therewithal Sir Gawaine put forth his spear, and Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5037'>another; and so they came so eagerly together that Sir Palomides smote</a>
<a id='line_5038'>Sir Gawaine to the earth, horse and all; and in the same wise he served</a>
<a id='line_5039'>Uwaine, Sir Dodinas, and Sagramore. All these four knights Sir</a>
<a id='line_5040'>Palomides smote down with divers spears. And then Sir Tristram departed</a>
<a id='line_5041'>toward Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_5042'></a>
<a id='line_5043'>And when they were departed then came thither Galihodin with his ten</a>
<a id='line_5044'>knights unto Sir Gawaine, and there he told him all how he had sped. I</a>
<a id='line_5045'>marvel, said Sir Gawaine, what knights they be, that are so arrayed in</a>
<a id='line_5046'>green. And that knight upon the white horse smote me down, said</a>
<a id='line_5047'>Galihodin, and my three fellows. And so he did to me, said Gawaine; and</a>
<a id='line_5048'>well I wot, said Sir Gawaine, that either he upon the white horse is</a>
<a id='line_5049'>Sir Tristram or else Sir Palomides, and that gay beseen lady is Queen</a>
<a id='line_5050'>Isoud. Thus they talked of one thing and of other.</a>
<a id='line_5051'></a>
<a id='line_5052'>And in the meanwhile Sir Tristram passed on till that he came to the</a>
<a id='line_5053'>well where his two pavilions were set; and there they alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_5054'>there they saw many pavilions and great array. Then Sir Tristram left</a>
<a id='line_5055'>there Sir Palomides and Sir Gareth with La Beale Isoud, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5056'>Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to Lonazep to hearken tidings; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5057'>Tristram rode upon Sir Palomides’ white horse. And when he came into</a>
<a id='line_5058'>the castle Sir Dinadan heard a great horn blow, and to the horn drew</a>
<a id='line_5059'>many knights. Then Sir Tristram asked a knight: What meaneth the blast</a>
<a id='line_5060'>of that horn? Sir, said that knight, it is all those that shall hold</a>
<a id='line_5061'>against King Arthur at this tournament. The first is the King of</a>
<a id='line_5062'>Ireland, and the King of Surluse, the King of Listinoise, the King of</a>
<a id='line_5063'>Northumberland, and the King of the best part of Wales, with many other</a>
<a id='line_5064'>countries. And these draw them to a council, to understand what</a>
<a id='line_5065'>governance they shall be of; but the King of Ireland, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_5066'>Marhalt, and father to the good knight Sir Marhaus that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5067'>slew, had all the speech that Sir Tristram might hear it. He said:</a>
<a id='line_5068'>Lords and fellows, let us look to ourself, for wit ye well King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5069'>is sure of many good knights, or else he would not with so few knights</a>
<a id='line_5070'>have ado with us; therefore by my counsel let every king have a</a>
<a id='line_5071'>standard and a cognisance by himself, that every knight draw to their</a>
<a id='line_5072'>natural lord, and then may every king and captain help his knights if</a>
<a id='line_5073'>they have need. When Sir Tristram had heard all their counsel he rode</a>
<a id='line_5074'>unto King Arthur for to hear of his counsel.</a>
<a id='line_5075'></a>
<a id='line_5076'></a>
<a id='line_5077'></a>
<a id='line_5078'></a>
<a id='line_5079'>CHAPTER LXVII. How Sir Tristram and his fellowship came into the</a>
<a id='line_5080'>tournament of Lonazep; and of divers jousts and matters.</a>
<a id='line_5081'></a>
<a id='line_5082'></a>
<a id='line_5083'>But Sir Tristram was not so soon come into the place, but Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_5084'>and Sir Galihodin went to King Arthur, and told him: That same green</a>
<a id='line_5085'>knight in the green harness with the white horse smote us two down, and</a>
<a id='line_5086'>six of our fellows this same day. Well, said Arthur. And then he called</a>
<a id='line_5087'>Sir Tristram and asked him what was his name. Sir, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5088'>ye shall hold me excused as at this time, for ye shall not wit my name.</a>
<a id='line_5089'>And there Sir Tristram returned and rode his way. I have marvel, said</a>
<a id='line_5090'>Arthur, that yonder knight will not tell me his name, but go thou,</a>
<a id='line_5091'>Griflet le Fise de Dieu, and pray him to speak with me betwixt us. Then</a>
<a id='line_5092'>Sir Griflet rode after him and overtook him, and said him that King</a>
<a id='line_5093'>Arthur prayed him for to speak with him secretly apart. Upon this</a>
<a id='line_5094'>covenant, said Sir Tristram, I will speak with him; that I will turn</a>
<a id='line_5095'>again so that ye will ensure me not to desire to hear my name. I shall</a>
<a id='line_5096'>undertake, said Sir Griflet, that he will not greatly desire it of you.</a>
<a id='line_5097'>So they rode together until they came to King Arthur. Fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_5098'>King Arthur, what is the cause ye will not tell me your name? Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_5099'>Sir Tristram, without a cause I will not hide my name. Upon what party</a>
<a id='line_5100'>will ye hold? said King Arthur. Truly, my lord, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_5101'>wot not yet on what party I will be on, until I come to the field, and</a>
<a id='line_5102'>there as my heart giveth me, there will I hold; but to-morrow ye shall</a>
<a id='line_5103'>see and prove on what party I shall come. And therewithal he returned</a>
<a id='line_5104'>and went to his pavilions.</a>
<a id='line_5105'></a>
<a id='line_5106'>And upon the morn they armed them all in green, and came into the</a>
<a id='line_5107'>field; and there young knights began to joust, and did many worshipful</a>
<a id='line_5108'>deeds. Then spake Gareth unto Sir Tristram, and prayed him to give him</a>
<a id='line_5109'>leave to break his spear, for him thought shame to bear his spear whole</a>
<a id='line_5110'>again. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he laughed, and said: I pray</a>
<a id='line_5111'>you do your best. Then Sir Gareth gat a spear and proffered to joust.</a>
<a id='line_5112'>That saw a knight that was nephew unto the King of the Hundred Knights;</a>
<a id='line_5113'>his name was Selises, and a good man of arms. So this knight Selises</a>
<a id='line_5114'>then dressed him unto Sir Gareth, and they two met together so hard</a>
<a id='line_5115'>that either smote other down, his horse and all, to the earth, so they</a>
<a id='line_5116'>were both bruised and hurt; and there they lay till the King with the</a>
<a id='line_5117'>Hundred Knights halp Selises up, and Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5118'>halp up Gareth again. And so they rode with Sir Gareth unto their</a>
<a id='line_5119'>pavilions, and then they pulled off his helm.</a>
<a id='line_5120'></a>
<a id='line_5121'>And when La Beale Isoud saw Sir Gareth bruised in the face she asked</a>
<a id='line_5122'>him what ailed him. Madam, said Sir Gareth, I had a great buffet, and</a>
<a id='line_5123'>as I suppose I gave another, but none of my fellows, God thank them,</a>
<a id='line_5124'>would not rescue me. Forsooth, said Palomides, it longed not to none of</a>
<a id='line_5125'>us as this day to joust, for there have not this day jousted no proved</a>
<a id='line_5126'>knights, and needly ye would joust. And when the other party saw ye</a>
<a id='line_5127'>proffered yourself to joust they sent one to you, a passing good knight</a>
<a id='line_5128'>of his age, for I know him well, his name is Selises; and worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_5129'>ye met with him, and neither of you are dishonoured, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_5130'>refresh yourself that ye may be ready and whole to joust to-morrow. As</a>
<a id='line_5131'>for that, said Gareth, I shall not fail you an I may bestride mine</a>
<a id='line_5132'>horse.</a>
<a id='line_5133'></a>

<a id='line_5136'></a>
<a id='line_5137'>CHAPTER LXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his fellowship jousted, and of the</a>
<a id='line_5138'>noble feats that they did in that tourneying.</a>
<a id='line_5139'></a>
<a id='line_5140'></a>
<a id='line_5141'>Now upon what party, said Tristram, is it best we be withal as to-morn?</a>
<a id='line_5142'>Sir, said Palomides, ye shall have mine advice to be against King</a>
<a id='line_5143'>Arthur as to-morn, for on his party will be Sir Launcelot and many good</a>
<a id='line_5144'>knights of his blood with him. And the more men of worship that they</a>
<a id='line_5145'>be, the more worship we shall win. That is full knightly spoken, said</a>
<a id='line_5146'>Sir Tristram; and right so as ye counsel me, so will we do. In the name</a>
<a id='line_5147'>of God, said they all. So that night they were lodged with the best.</a>
<a id='line_5148'>And on the morn when it was day they were arrayed all in green</a>
<a id='line_5149'>trappings, shields and spears, and La Beale Isoud in the same colour,</a>
<a id='line_5150'>and her three damosels. And right so these four knights came into the</a>
<a id='line_5151'>field endlong and through. And so they led La Beale Isoud thither as</a>
<a id='line_5152'>she should stand and behold all the jousts in a bay window; but always</a>
<a id='line_5153'>she was wimpled that no man might see her visage. And then these three</a>
<a id='line_5154'>knights rode straight unto the party of the King of Scots.</a>
<a id='line_5155'></a>
<a id='line_5156'>When King Arthur had seen them do all this he asked Sir Launcelot what</a>
<a id='line_5157'>were these knights and that queen. Sir, said Launcelot, I cannot say</a>
<a id='line_5158'>you in certain, but if Sir Tristram be in this country, or Sir</a>
<a id='line_5159'>Palomides, wit ye well it be they m certain, and La Beale Isoud. Then</a>
<a id='line_5160'>Arthur called to him Sir Kay and said: Go lightly and wit how many</a>
<a id='line_5161'>knights there be here lacking of the Table Round, for by the sieges</a>
<a id='line_5162'>thou mayst know. So went Sir Kay and saw by the writings in the sieges</a>
<a id='line_5163'>that there lacked ten knights. And these be their names that be not</a>
<a id='line_5164'>here. Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, Sir Percivale, Sir Gaheris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5165'>Epinogris, Sir Mordred, Sir Dinadan, Sir La Cote Male Taile, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5166'>Pelleas the noble knight. Well, said Arthur, some of these I dare</a>
<a id='line_5167'>undertake are here this day against us.</a>
<a id='line_5168'></a>
<a id='line_5169'>Then came therein two brethren, cousins unto Sir Gawaine, the one hight</a>
<a id='line_5170'>Sir Edward, that other hight Sir Sadok, the which were two good</a>
<a id='line_5171'>knights; and they asked of King Arthur that they might have the first</a>
<a id='line_5172'>jousts, for they were of Orkney. I am pleased, said King Arthur. Then</a>
<a id='line_5173'>Sir Edward encountered with the King of Scots, in whose party was Sir</a>
<a id='line_5174'>Tristram and Sir Palomides; and Sir Edward smote the King of Scots</a>
<a id='line_5175'>quite from his horse, and Sir Sadok smote down the King of North Wales,</a>
<a id='line_5176'>and gave him a wonder great fall, that there was a great cry on King</a>
<a id='line_5177'>Arthur’s party, and that made Sir Palomides passing wroth. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_5178'>Palomides dressed his shield and his spear, and with all his might he</a>
<a id='line_5179'>met with Sir Edward of Orkney, that he smote him so hard that his horse</a>
<a id='line_5180'>might not stand on his feet, and so they hurtled to the earth; and then</a>
<a id='line_5181'>with the same spear Sir Palomides smote down Sir Sadok over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_5182'>croup. O Jesu, said Arthur, what knight is that arrayed all in green?</a>
<a id='line_5183'>he jousteth mightily. Wit you well, said Sir Gawaine, he is a good</a>
<a id='line_5184'>knight, and yet shall ye see him joust better or he depart. And yet</a>
<a id='line_5185'>shall ye see, said Sir Gawaine, another bigger knight, in the same</a>
<a id='line_5186'>colour, than he is; for that same knight, said Sir Gawaine, that smote</a>
<a id='line_5187'>down right now my four cousins, he smote me down within these two days,</a>
<a id='line_5188'>and seven fellows more.</a>
<a id='line_5189'></a>
<a id='line_5190'>This meanwhile as they stood thus talking there came into the place Sir</a>
<a id='line_5191'>Tristram upon a black horse, and or ever he stint he smote down with</a>
<a id='line_5192'>one spear four good knights of Orkney that were of the kin of Sir</a>
<a id='line_5193'>Gawaine; and Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan everych of them smote down a</a>
<a id='line_5194'>good knight. Jesu, said Arthur, yonder knight upon the black horse doth</a>
<a id='line_5195'>mightily and marvellously well. Abide you, said Sir Gawaine; that</a>
<a id='line_5196'>knight with the black horse began not yet. Then Sir Tristram made to</a>
<a id='line_5197'>horse again the two kings that Edward and Sadok had unhorsed at the</a>
<a id='line_5198'>beginning. And then Sir Tristram drew his sword and rode into the</a>
<a id='line_5199'>thickest of the press against them of Orkney; and there he smote down</a>
<a id='line_5200'>knights, and rashed off helms, and pulled away their shields, and</a>
<a id='line_5201'>hurtled down many knights: he fared so that Sir Arthur and all knights</a>
<a id='line_5202'>had great marvel when they saw one knight do so great deeds of arms.</a>
<a id='line_5203'>And Sir Palomides failed not upon the other side, but did so</a>
<a id='line_5204'>marvellously well that all men had wonder. For there King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5205'>likened Sir Tristram that was on the black horse like to a wood lion,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>and likened Sir Palomides upon the white horse unto a wood leopard, and</a>
<a id='line_5207'>Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan unto eager wolves. But the custom was such</a>
<a id='line_5208'>among them that none of the kings would help other, but all the</a>
<a id='line_5209'>fellowship of every standard to help other as they might; but ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_5210'>Tristram did so much deeds of arms that they of Orkney waxed weary of</a>
<a id='line_5211'>him, and so withdrew them unto Lonazep.</a>
<a id='line_5212'></a>
<a id='line_5213'></a>
<a id='line_5214'></a>
<a id='line_5215'></a>
<a id='line_5216'>CHAPTER LXIX. How Sir Tristram was unhorsed and smitten down by Sir</a>
<a id='line_5217'>Launcelot, and after that Sir Tristram smote down King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_5218'></a>
<a id='line_5219'></a>
<a id='line_5220'>Then was the cry of heralds and all manner of common people: The Green</a>
<a id='line_5221'>Knight hath done marvellously, and beaten all them of Orkney. And there</a>
<a id='line_5222'>the heralds numbered that Sir Tristram that sat upon the black horse</a>
<a id='line_5223'>had smitten down with spears and swords thirty knights; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5224'>Palomides had smitten down twenty knights, and the most part of these</a>
<a id='line_5225'>fifty knights were of the house of King Arthur, and proved knights. So</a>
<a id='line_5226'>God me help, said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot, this is a great shame to</a>
<a id='line_5227'>us to see four knights beat so many knights of mine; and therefore make</a>
<a id='line_5228'>you ready, for we will have ado with them. Sir, said Launcelot, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_5229'>well that there are two passing good knights, and great worship were it</a>
<a id='line_5230'>not to us now to have ado with them, for they have this day sore</a>
<a id='line_5231'>travailed. As for that, said Arthur, I will be avenged; and therefore</a>
<a id='line_5232'>take with you Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector, and I will be the fourth,</a>
<a id='line_5233'>said Arthur. Sir, said Launcelot, ye shall find me ready, and my</a>
<a id='line_5234'>brother Sir Ector, and my cousin Sir Bleoberis. And so when they were</a>
<a id='line_5235'>ready and on horseback: Now choose, said Sir Arthur unto Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_5236'>with whom that ye will encounter withal. Sir, said Launcelot, I will</a>
<a id='line_5237'>meet with the green knight upon the black horse, that was Sir Tristram;</a>
<a id='line_5238'>and my cousin Sir Bleoberis shall match the green knight upon the white</a>
<a id='line_5239'>horse, that was Sir Palomides; and my brother Sir Ector shall match</a>
<a id='line_5240'>with the green knight upon the white horse, that was Sir Gareth. Then</a>
<a id='line_5241'>must I, said Sir Arthur, have ado with the green knight upon the</a>
<a id='line_5242'>grisled horse, and that was Sir Dinadan. Now every man take heed to his</a>
<a id='line_5243'>fellow, said Sir Launcelot. And so they trotted on together, and there</a>
<a id='line_5244'>encountered Sir Launcelot against Sir Tristram. So Sir Launcelot smote</a>
<a id='line_5245'>Sir Tristram so sore upon the shield that he bare horse and man to the</a>
<a id='line_5246'>earth; but Sir Launcelot weened that it had been Sir Palomides, and so</a>
<a id='line_5247'>he passed forth. And then Sir Bleoberis encountered with Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_5248'>and he smote him so hard upon the shield that Sir Palomides and his</a>
<a id='line_5249'>white horse rustled to the earth. Then Sir Ector de Maris smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_5250'>Gareth so hard that down he fell off his horse. And the noble King</a>
<a id='line_5251'>Arthur encountered with Sir Dinadan, and he smote him quite from his</a>
<a id='line_5252'>saddle. And then the noise turned awhile how the green knights were</a>
<a id='line_5253'>slain down.</a>
<a id='line_5254'></a>
<a id='line_5255'>When the King of Northgalis saw that Sir Tristram had a fall, then he</a>
<a id='line_5256'>remembered him how great deeds of arms Sir Tristram had done. Then he</a>
<a id='line_5257'>made ready many knights, for the custom and cry was such, that what</a>
<a id='line_5258'>knight were smitten down, and might not be horsed again by his fellows,</a>
<a id='line_5259'>outher by his own strength, that as that day he should be prisoner unto</a>
<a id='line_5260'>the party that had smitten him down. So came in the King of Northgalis,</a>
<a id='line_5261'>and he rode straight unto Sir Tristram; and when he came nigh him he</a>
<a id='line_5262'>alighted down suddenly and betook Sir Tristram his horse, and said</a>
<a id='line_5263'>thus: Noble knight, I know thee not of what country that thou art, but</a>
<a id='line_5264'>for the noble deeds that thou hast done this day take there my horse,</a>
<a id='line_5265'>and let me do as well I may; for, as Jesu me help, thou art better</a>
<a id='line_5266'>worthy to have mine horse than I myself. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5267'>and if I may I shall quite you: look that ye go not far from us, and as</a>
<a id='line_5268'>I suppose, I shall win you another horse. And therewith Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5269'>mounted upon his horse, and there he met with King Arthur, and he gave</a>
<a id='line_5270'>him such a buffet upon the helm with his sword that King Arthur had no</a>
<a id='line_5271'>power to keep his saddle. And then Sir Tristram gave the King of</a>
<a id='line_5272'>Northgalis King Arthur’s horse: then was there great press about King</a>
<a id='line_5273'>Arthur for to horse him again; but Sir Palomides would not suffer King</a>
<a id='line_5274'>Arthur to be horsed again, but ever Sir Palomides smote on the right</a>
<a id='line_5275'>hand and on the left hand mightily as a noble knight. And this</a>
<a id='line_5276'>meanwhile Sir Tristram rode through the thickest of the press, and</a>
<a id='line_5277'>smote down knights on the right hand and on the left hand, and raced</a>
<a id='line_5278'>off helms, and so passed forth unto his pavilions, and left Sir</a>
<a id='line_5279'>Palomides on foot; and Sir Tristram changed his horse and disguised</a>
<a id='line_5280'>himself all in red, horse and harness.</a>
<a id='line_5281'></a>
<a id='line_5282'></a>
<a id='line_5283'></a>
<a id='line_5284'></a>
<a id='line_5285'>CHAPTER LXX. How Sir Tristram changed his harness and it was all red,</a>
<a id='line_5286'>and how he demeaned him, and how Sir Palomides slew Launcelot’s horse.</a>
<a id='line_5287'></a>
<a id='line_5288'></a>
<a id='line_5289'>And when the queen La Beale Isoud saw that Sir Tristram was unhorsed,</a>
<a id='line_5290'>and she wist not where he was, then she wept greatly. But Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5291'>when he was ready, came dashing lightly into the field, and then La</a>
<a id='line_5292'>Beale Isoud espied him. And so he did great deeds of arms; with one</a>
<a id='line_5293'>spear, that was great, Sir Tristram smote down five knights or ever he</a>
<a id='line_5294'>stint. Then Sir Launcelot espied him readily, that it was Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5295'>and then he repented him that he had smitten him down; and so Sir</a>
<a id='line_5296'>Launcelot went out of the press to repose him and lightly he came</a>
<a id='line_5297'>again. And now when Sir Tristram came into the press, through his great</a>
<a id='line_5298'>force he put Sir Palomides upon his horse, and Sir Gareth, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5299'>Dinadan, and then they began to do marvellously; but Sir Palomides nor</a>
<a id='line_5300'>none of his two fellows knew not who had holpen them on horseback</a>
<a id='line_5301'>again. But ever Sir Tristram was nigh them and succoured them, and they</a>
<a id='line_5302'>[knew] not him, because he was changed into red armour: and all this</a>
<a id='line_5303'>while Sir Launcelot was away.</a>
<a id='line_5304'></a>
<a id='line_5305'>So when La Beale Isoud knew Sir Tristram again upon his horse-back she</a>
<a id='line_5306'>was passing glad, and then she laughed and made good cheer. And as it</a>
<a id='line_5307'>happened, Sir Palomides looked up toward her where she lay in the</a>
<a id='line_5308'>window, and he espied how she laughed; and therewith he took such a</a>
<a id='line_5309'>rejoicing that he smote down, what with his spear and with his sword,</a>
<a id='line_5310'>all that ever he met; for through the sight of her he was so enamoured</a>
<a id='line_5311'>in her love that he seemed at that time, that an both Sir Tristram and</a>
<a id='line_5312'>Sir Launcelot had been both against him they should have won no worship</a>
<a id='line_5313'>of him; and in his heart, as the book saith, Sir Palomides wished that</a>
<a id='line_5314'>with his worship he might have ado with Sir Tristram before all men,</a>
<a id='line_5315'>because of La Beale Isoud. Then Sir Palomides began to double his</a>
<a id='line_5316'>strength, and he did so marvellously that all men had wonder of him,</a>
<a id='line_5317'>and ever he cast up his eye unto La Beale Isoud. And when he saw her</a>
<a id='line_5318'>make such cheer he fared like a lion, that there might no man withstand</a>
<a id='line_5319'>him; and then Sir Tristram beheld him, how that Sir Palomides bestirred</a>
<a id='line_5320'>him; and then he said unto Sir Dinadan: So God me help, Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5321'>is a passing good knight and a well enduring, but such deeds saw I him</a>
<a id='line_5322'>never do, nor never heard I tell that ever he did so much in one day.</a>
<a id='line_5323'>It is his day, said Dinadan; and he would say no more unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_5324'>Tristram; but to himself he said: An if ye knew for whose love he doth</a>
<a id='line_5325'>all those deeds of arms, soon would Sir Tristram abate his courage.</a>
<a id='line_5326'>Alas, said Sir Tristram, that Sir Palomides is not christened. So said</a>
<a id='line_5327'>King Arthur, and so said all those that beheld him. Then all people</a>
<a id='line_5328'>gave him the prize, as for the best knight that day, that he passed Sir</a>
<a id='line_5329'>Launcelot outher Sir Tristram. Well, said Dinadan to himself, all this</a>
<a id='line_5330'>worship that Sir Palomides hath here this day he may thank the Queen</a>
<a id='line_5331'>Isoud, for had she been away this day Sir Palomides had not gotten the</a>
<a id='line_5332'>prize this day.</a>
<a id='line_5333'></a>
<a id='line_5334'>Right so came into the field Sir Launcelot du Lake, and saw and heard</a>
<a id='line_5335'>the noise and cry and the great worship that Sir Palomides had. He</a>
<a id='line_5336'>dressed him against Sir Palomides, with a great mighty spear and a</a>
<a id='line_5337'>long, and thought to smite him down. And when Sir Palomides saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_5338'>Launcelot come upon him so fast, he ran upon Sir Launcelot as fast with</a>
<a id='line_5339'>his sword as he might; and as Sir Launcelot should have stricken him he</a>
<a id='line_5340'>smote his spear aside, and smote it a-two with his sword. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_5341'>Palomides rushed unto Sir Launcelot, and thought to have put him to a</a>
<a id='line_5342'>shame; and with his sword he smote his horse’s neck that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_5343'>rode upon, and then Sir Launcelot fell to the earth. Then was the cry</a>
<a id='line_5344'>huge and great: See how Sir Palomides the Saracen hath smitten down Sir</a>
<a id='line_5345'>Launcelot’s horse. Right then were there many knights wroth with Sir</a>
<a id='line_5346'>Palomides because he had done that deed; therefore many knights held</a>
<a id='line_5347'>there against that it was unknightly done in a tournament to kill an</a>
<a id='line_5348'>horse wilfully, but that it had been done in plain battle, life for</a>
<a id='line_5349'>life.</a>
<a id='line_5350'></a>
<a id='line_5351'></a>
<a id='line_5352'></a>
<a id='line_5353'></a>
<a id='line_5354'>CHAPTER LXXI. How Sir Launcelot said to Sir Palomides, and how the</a>
<a id='line_5355'>prize of that day was given unto Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_5356'></a>
<a id='line_5357'></a>
<a id='line_5358'>When Sir Ector de Maris saw Sir Launcelot his brother have such a</a>
<a id='line_5359'>despite, and so set on foot, then he gat a spear eagerly, and ran</a>
<a id='line_5360'>against Sir Palomides, and he smote him so hard that he bare him quite</a>
<a id='line_5361'>from his horse. That saw Sir Tristram, that was in red harness, and he</a>
<a id='line_5362'>smote down Sir Ector de Maris quite from his horse. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_5363'>dressed his shield upon his shoulder, and with his sword naked in his</a>
<a id='line_5364'>hand, and so came straight upon Sir Palomides fiercely and said: Wit</a>
<a id='line_5365'>thou well thou hast done me this day the greatest despite that ever any</a>
<a id='line_5366'>worshipful knight did to me in tournament or in jousts, and therefore I</a>
<a id='line_5367'>will be avenged upon thee, therefore take keep to yourself. Ah, mercy,</a>
<a id='line_5368'>noble knight, said Palomides, and forgive me mine unkindly deeds, for I</a>
<a id='line_5369'>have no power nor might to withstand you, and I have done so much this</a>
<a id='line_5370'>day that well I wot I did never so much, nor never shall in my</a>
<a id='line_5371'>life-days; and therefore, most noble knight, I require thee spare me as</a>
<a id='line_5372'>at this day, and I promise you I shall ever be your knight while I</a>
<a id='line_5373'>live: an ye put me from my worship now, ye put me from the greatest</a>
<a id='line_5374'>worship that ever I had or ever shall have in my life-days. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_5375'>Sir Launcelot, I see, for to say thee sooth, ye have done marvellously</a>
<a id='line_5376'>well this day; and I understand a part for whose love ye do it, and</a>
<a id='line_5377'>well I wot that love is a great mistress. And if my lady were here as</a>
<a id='line_5378'>she nis not, wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, ye should not bear away</a>
<a id='line_5379'>the worship. But beware your love be not discovered, for an Sir</a>
<a id='line_5380'>Tristram may know it ye will repent it; and sithen my quarrel is not</a>
<a id='line_5381'>here, ye shall have this day the worship as for me; considering the</a>
<a id='line_5382'>great travail and pain that ye have had this day, it were no worship</a>
<a id='line_5383'>for me to put you from it. And therewithal Sir Launcelot suffered Sir</a>
<a id='line_5384'>Palomides to depart.</a>
<a id='line_5385'></a>
<a id='line_5386'>Then Sir Launcelot by great force and might gat his own horse maugre</a>
<a id='line_5387'>twenty knights. So when Sir Launcelot was horsed he did many marvels,</a>
<a id='line_5388'>and so did Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides in like wise. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5389'>Launcelot smote down with a spear Sir Dinadan, and the King of</a>
<a id='line_5390'>Scotland, and the King of Wales, and the King of Northumberland, and</a>
<a id='line_5391'>the King of Listinoise. So then Sir Launcelot and his fellows smote</a>
<a id='line_5392'>down well a forty knights. Then came the King of Ireland and the King</a>
<a id='line_5393'>of the Straight Marches to rescue Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides. There</a>
<a id='line_5394'>began a great medley, and many knights were smitten down on both</a>
<a id='line_5395'>parties; and always Sir Launcelot spared Sir Tristram, and he spared</a>
<a id='line_5396'>him. And Sir Palomides would not meddle with Sir Launcelot, and so</a>
<a id='line_5397'>there was hurtling here and there. And then King Arthur sent out many</a>
<a id='line_5398'>knights of the Table Round; and Sir Palomides was ever in the foremost</a>
<a id='line_5399'>front, and Sir Tristram did so strongly well that the king and all</a>
<a id='line_5400'>other had marvel. And then the king let blow to lodging; and because</a>
<a id='line_5401'>Sir Palomides began first, and never he went nor rode out of the field</a>
<a id='line_5402'>to repose, but ever he was doing marvellously well either on foot or on</a>
<a id='line_5403'>horseback, and longest during, King Arthur and all the kings gave Sir</a>
<a id='line_5404'>Palomides the honour and the gree as for that day.</a>
<a id='line_5405'></a>
<a id='line_5406'>Then Sir Tristram commanded Sir Dinadan to fetch the queen La Beale</a>
<a id='line_5407'>Isoud, and bring her to his two pavilions that stood by the well. And</a>
<a id='line_5408'>so Dinadan did as he was commanded. But when Sir Palomides understood</a>
<a id='line_5409'>and wist that Sir Tristram was in the red armour, and on a red horse,</a>
<a id='line_5410'>wit ye well that he was glad, and so was Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_5411'>for they all weened that Sir Tristram had been taken prisoner. And then</a>
<a id='line_5412'>every knight drew to his inn. And then King Arthur and every knight</a>
<a id='line_5413'>spake of those knights; but above all men they gave Sir Palomides the</a>
<a id='line_5414'>prize, and all knights that knew Sir Palomides had wonder of his deeds.</a>
<a id='line_5415'>Sir, said Sir Launcelot unto Arthur, as for Sir Palomides an he be the</a>
<a id='line_5416'>green knight I dare say as for this day he is best worthy to have the</a>
<a id='line_5417'>degree, for he reposed him never, nor never changed his weeds, and he</a>
<a id='line_5418'>began first and longest held on. And yet, well I wot, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5419'>Launcelot, that there was a better knight than he, and that shall be</a>
<a id='line_5420'>proved or we depart, upon pain of my life. Thus they talked on either</a>
<a id='line_5421'>party; and so Sir Dinadan railed with Sir Tristram and said: What the</a>
<a id='line_5422'>devil is upon thee this day? for Sir Palomides’ strength feebled never</a>
<a id='line_5423'>this day, but ever he doubled his strength.</a>
<a id='line_5424'></a>

<a id='line_5427'></a>
<a id='line_5428'>CHAPTER LXXII. How Sir Dinadan provoked Sir Tristram to do well.</a>
<a id='line_5429'></a>
<a id='line_5430'></a>
<a id='line_5431'>And thou, Sir Tristram, farest all this day as though thou hadst been</a>
<a id='line_5432'>asleep, and therefore I call thee coward. Well, Dinadan, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5433'>Tristram, I was never called coward or now of no earthly knight in my</a>
<a id='line_5434'>life; and wit thou well, sir, I call myself never the more coward</a>
<a id='line_5435'>though Sir Launcelot gave me a fall, for I outcept him of all knights.</a>
<a id='line_5436'>And doubt ye not Sir Dinadan, an Sir Launcelot have a quarrel good, he</a>
<a id='line_5437'>is too over good for any knight that now is living; and yet of his</a>
<a id='line_5438'>sufferance, largess, bounty, and courtesy, I call him knight peerless:</a>
<a id='line_5439'>and so Sir Tristram was in manner wroth with Sir Dinadan. But all this</a>
<a id='line_5440'>language Sir Dinadan said because he would anger Sir Tristram, for to</a>
<a id='line_5441'>cause him to awake his spirits and to be wroth; for well knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_5442'>Dinadan that an Sir Tristram were thoroughly wroth Sir Palomides should</a>
<a id='line_5443'>not get the prize upon the morn. And for this intent Sir Dinadan said</a>
<a id='line_5444'>all this railing and language against Sir Tristram. Truly, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5445'>Palomides, as for Sir Launcelot, of his noble knighthood, courtesy, and</a>
<a id='line_5446'>prowess, and gentleness, I know not his peer; for this day, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5447'>Palomides, I did full uncourteously unto Sir Launcelot, and full</a>
<a id='line_5448'>unknightly, and full knightly and courteously he did to me again; for</a>
<a id='line_5449'>an he had been as ungentle to me as I was to him, this day I had won no</a>
<a id='line_5450'>worship. And therefore, said Palomides, I shall be Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_5451'>knight while my life lasteth. This talking was in the houses of kings.</a>
<a id='line_5452'>But all kings, lords, and knights, said, of clear knighthood, and of</a>
<a id='line_5453'>pure strength, of bounty, of courtesy, Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5454'>bare the prize above all knights that ever were in Arthur’s days. And</a>
<a id='line_5455'>there were never knights in Arthur’s days did half so many deeds as</a>
<a id='line_5456'>they did; as the book saith, no ten knights did not half the deeds that</a>
<a id='line_5457'>they did, and there was never knight in their days that required Sir</a>
<a id='line_5458'>Launcelot or Sir Tristram of any quest, so it were not to their shame,</a>
<a id='line_5459'>but they performed their desire.</a>
<a id='line_5460'></a>
<a id='line_5461'></a>
<a id='line_5462'></a>
<a id='line_5463'></a>
<a id='line_5464'>CHAPTER LXXIII. How King Arthur and Sir Lancelot came to see La Beale</a>
<a id='line_5465'>Isoud, and how Palomides smote down King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_5466'></a>
<a id='line_5467'></a>
<a id='line_5468'>So on the morn Sir Launcelot departed, and Sir Tristram was ready, and</a>
<a id='line_5469'>La Beale Isoud with Sir Palomides and Sir Gareth. And so they rode all</a>
<a id='line_5470'>in green full freshly beseen unto the forest. And Sir Tristram left Sir</a>
<a id='line_5471'>Dinadan sleeping in his bed. And so as they rode it happed the king and</a>
<a id='line_5472'>Launcelot stood in a window, and saw Sir Tristram ride and Isoud. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_5473'>said Launcelot, yonder rideth the fairest lady of the world except your</a>
<a id='line_5474'>queen, Dame Guenever. Who is that? said Sir Arthur. Sir, said he, it is</a>
<a id='line_5475'>Queen Isoud that, out-taken my lady your queen, she is makeless. Take</a>
<a id='line_5476'>your horse, said Arthur, and array you at all rights as I will do, and</a>
<a id='line_5477'>I promise you, said the king, I will see her. Then anon they were armed</a>
<a id='line_5478'>and horsed, and either took a spear and rode unto the forest. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_5479'>Launcelot, it is not good that ye go too nigh them, for wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_5480'>there are two as good knights as now are living, and therefore, sir, I</a>
<a id='line_5481'>pray you be not too hasty. For peradventure there will be some knights</a>
<a id='line_5482'>be displeased an we come suddenly upon them. As for that, said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_5483'>I will see her, for I take no force whom I grieve. Sir, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_5484'>ye put yourself in great jeopardy. As for that, said the king, we will</a>
<a id='line_5485'>take the adventure. Right so anon the king rode even to her, and</a>
<a id='line_5486'>saluted her, and said: God you save. Sir, said she, ye are welcome.</a>
<a id='line_5487'>Then the king beheld her, and liked her wonderly well.</a>
<a id='line_5488'></a>
<a id='line_5489'>With that came Sir Palomides unto Arthur, and said: Uncourteous knight,</a>
<a id='line_5490'>what seekest thou here? thou art uncourteous to come upon a lady thus</a>
<a id='line_5491'>suddenly, therefore withdraw thee. Sir Arthur took none heed of Sir</a>
<a id='line_5492'>Palomides’ words, but ever he looked still upon Queen Isoud. Then was</a>
<a id='line_5493'>Sir Palomides wroth, and therewith he took a spear, and came hurtling</a>
<a id='line_5494'>upon King Arthur, and smote him down with a spear. When Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_5495'>saw that despite of Sir Palomides, he said to himself: I am loath to</a>
<a id='line_5496'>have ado with yonder knight, and not for his own sake but for Sir</a>
<a id='line_5497'>Tristram. And one thing I am sure of, if I smite down Sir Palomides I</a>
<a id='line_5498'>must have ado with Sir Tristram, and that were overmuch for me to match</a>
<a id='line_5499'>them both, for they are two noble knights; notwithstanding, whether I</a>
<a id='line_5500'>live or I die, needs must I revenge my lord, and so will I, whatsomever</a>
<a id='line_5501'>befall of me. And therewith Sir Launcelot cried to Sir Palomides: Keep</a>
<a id='line_5502'>thee from me. And then Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides rushed together</a>
<a id='line_5503'>with two spears strongly, but Sir Launcelot smote Sir Palomides so hard</a>
<a id='line_5504'>that he went quite out of his saddle, and had a great fall. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_5505'>Tristram saw Sir Palomides have that fall, he said to Sir Launcelot:</a>
<a id='line_5506'>Sir knight, keep thee, for I must joust with thee. As for to joust with</a>
<a id='line_5507'>me, said Sir Launcelot, I will not fail you, for no dread I have of</a>
<a id='line_5508'>you; but I am loath to have ado with you an I might choose, for I will</a>
<a id='line_5509'>that ye wit that I must revenge my special lord that was unhorsed</a>
<a id='line_5510'>unwarly and unknightly. And therefore, though I revenged that fall,</a>
<a id='line_5511'>take ye no displeasure therein, for he is to me such a friend that I</a>
<a id='line_5512'>may not see him shamed.</a>
<a id='line_5513'></a>
<a id='line_5514'>Anon Sir Tristram understood by his person and by his knightly words</a>
<a id='line_5515'>that it was Sir Launcelot du Lake, and verily Sir Tristram deemed that</a>
<a id='line_5516'>it was King Arthur, he that Sir Palomides had smitten down. And then</a>
<a id='line_5517'>Sir Tristram put his spear from him, and put Sir Palomides again on</a>
<a id='line_5518'>horseback, and Sir Launcelot put King Arthur on horseback and so</a>
<a id='line_5519'>departed. So God me help, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, ye did not</a>
<a id='line_5520'>worshipfully when ye smote down that knight so suddenly as ye did. And</a>
<a id='line_5521'>wit ye well ye did yourself great shame, for the knights came hither of</a>
<a id='line_5522'>their gentleness to see a fair lady; and that is every good knight’s</a>
<a id='line_5523'>part, to behold a fair lady; and ye had not ado to play such masteries</a>
<a id='line_5524'>afore my lady. Wit thou well it will turn to anger, for he that ye</a>
<a id='line_5525'>smote down was King Arthur, and that other was the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_5526'>Launcelot. But I shall not forget the words of Sir Launcelot when that</a>
<a id='line_5527'>he called him a man of great worship, thereby I wist that it was King</a>
<a id='line_5528'>Arthur. And as for Sir Launcelot, an there had been five hundred</a>
<a id='line_5529'>knights in the meadow, he would not have refused them, and yet he said</a>
<a id='line_5530'>he would refuse me. By that again I wist that it was Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_5531'>ever he forbeareth me in every place, and showeth me great kindness;</a>
<a id='line_5532'>and of all knights, I out-take none, say what men will say, he beareth</a>
<a id='line_5533'>the flower of all chivalry, say it him whosomever will. An he be well</a>
<a id='line_5534'>angered, and that him list to do his utterance without any favour, I</a>
<a id='line_5535'>know him not alive but Sir Launcelot is over hard for him, be it on</a>
<a id='line_5536'>horseback or on foot. I may never believe, said Palomides, that King</a>
<a id='line_5537'>Arthur will ride so privily as a poor errant knight. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5538'>Tristram, ye know not my lord Arthur, for all knights may learn to be a</a>
<a id='line_5539'>knight of him. And therefore ye may be sorry, said Sir Tristram, of</a>
<a id='line_5540'>your unkindly deeds to so noble a king. And a thing that is done may</a>
<a id='line_5541'>not be undone, said Palomides. Then Sir Tristram sent Queen Isoud unto</a>
<a id='line_5542'>her lodging in the priory, there to behold all the tournament.</a>
<a id='line_5543'></a>
<a id='line_5544'></a>
<a id='line_5545'></a>
<a id='line_5546'></a>
<a id='line_5547'>CHAPTER LXXIV. How the second day Palomides forsook Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_5548'>went to the contrary part against him.</a>
<a id='line_5549'></a>
<a id='line_5550'></a>
<a id='line_5551'>Then there was a cry unto all knights, that when they heard an horn</a>
<a id='line_5552'>blow they should make jousts as they did the first day. And like as the</a>
<a id='line_5553'>brethren Sir Edward and Sir Sadok began the jousts the first day, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5554'>Uwaine the king’s son Urien and Sir Lucanere de Buttelere began the</a>
<a id='line_5555'>jousts the second day. And at the first encounter</a>
<a id='line_5556'></a>
<a id='line_5557'>Sir Uwaine smote down the King’s son of Scots; and Sir Lucanere ran</a>
<a id='line_5558'>against the King of Wales, and they brake their spears all to pieces;</a>
<a id='line_5559'>and they were so fierce both, that they hurtled together that both fell</a>
<a id='line_5560'>to the earth. Then they of Orkney horsed again Sir Lucanere. And then</a>
<a id='line_5561'>came in Sir Tristram de Liones; and then Sir Tristram smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_5562'>Uwaine and Sir Lucanere; and Sir Palomides smote down other two knights</a>
<a id='line_5563'>and Sir Gareth smote down other two knights. Then said Sir Arthur unto</a>
<a id='line_5564'>Sir Launcelot: See yonder three knights do passingly well, and namely</a>
<a id='line_5565'>the first that jousted. Sir, said Launcelot, that knight began not yet</a>
<a id='line_5566'>but ye shall see him this day do marvellously. And then came into the</a>
<a id='line_5567'>place the duke’s son of Orkney, and then they began to do many deeds of</a>
<a id='line_5568'>arms.</a>
<a id='line_5569'></a>
<a id='line_5570'>When Sir Tristram saw them so begin, he said to Palomides: How feel ye</a>
<a id='line_5571'>yourself? may ye do this day as ye did yesterday? Nay, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_5572'>I feel myself so weary, and so sore bruised of the deeds of yesterday,</a>
<a id='line_5573'>that I may not endure as I did yesterday. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5574'>Tristram, for I shall lack you this day. Sir Palomides said: Trust not</a>
<a id='line_5575'>to me, for I may not do as I did. All these words said Palomides for to</a>
<a id='line_5576'>beguile Sir Tristram. Sir, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Gareth, then must</a>
<a id='line_5577'>I trust upon you; wherefore I pray you be not far from me to rescue me.</a>
<a id='line_5578'>An need be, said Sir Gareth, I shall not fail you in all that I may do.</a>
<a id='line_5579'>Then Sir Palomides rode by himself; and then in despite of Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5580'>he put himself in the thickest press among them of Orkney, and there he</a>
<a id='line_5581'>did so marvellously deeds of arms that all men had wonder of him, for</a>
<a id='line_5582'>there might none stand him a stroke.</a>
<a id='line_5583'></a>
<a id='line_5584'>When Sir Tristram saw Sir Palomides do such deeds, he marvelled and</a>
<a id='line_5585'>said to himself: He is weary of my company. So Sir Tristram beheld him</a>
<a id='line_5586'>a great while and did but little else, for the noise and cry was so</a>
<a id='line_5587'>huge and great that Sir Tristram marvelled from whence came the</a>
<a id='line_5588'>strength that Sir Palomides had there in the field. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5589'>Gareth unto Sir Tristram, remember ye not of the words that Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_5590'>said to you yesterday, when he called you a coward; forsooth, sir, he</a>
<a id='line_5591'>said it for none ill, for ye are the man in the world that he most</a>
<a id='line_5592'>loveth, and all that he said was for your worship. And therefore, said</a>
<a id='line_5593'>Sir Gareth to Sir Tristram, let me know this day what ye be; and wonder</a>
<a id='line_5594'>ye not so upon Sir Palomides, for he enforceth himself to win all the</a>
<a id='line_5595'>worship and honour from you. I may well believe it, said Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_5596'>And sithen I understand his evil will and his envy, ye shall see, if</a>
<a id='line_5597'>that I enforce myself, that the noise shall be left that now is upon</a>
<a id='line_5598'>him.</a>
<a id='line_5599'></a>
<a id='line_5600'>Then Sir Tristram rode into the thickest of the press, and then he did</a>
<a id='line_5601'>so marvellously well, and did so great deeds of arms, that all men said</a>
<a id='line_5602'>that Sir Tristram did double so much deeds of arms as Sir Palomides had</a>
<a id='line_5603'>done aforehand. And then the noise went plain from Sir Palomides, and</a>
<a id='line_5604'>all the people cried upon Sir Tristram. O Jesu, said the people, see</a>
<a id='line_5605'>how Sir Tristram smiteth down with his spear so many knights. And see,</a>
<a id='line_5606'>said they all, how many knights he smiteth down with his sword, and of</a>
<a id='line_5607'>how many knights he rashed off their helms and their shields; and so he</a>
<a id='line_5608'>beat them all of Orkney afore him. How now, said Sir Launcelot unto</a>
<a id='line_5609'>King Arthur, I told you that this day there would a knight play his</a>
<a id='line_5610'>pageant. Yonder rideth a knight ye may see he doth knightly, for he</a>
<a id='line_5611'>hath strength and wind. So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_5612'>say sooth, for I saw never a better knight, for he passeth far Sir</a>
<a id='line_5613'>Palomides. Sir, wit ye well, said Launcelot, it must be so of right,</a>
<a id='line_5614'>for it is himself, that noble knight Sir Tristram. I may right well</a>
<a id='line_5615'>believe it, said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_5616'></a>
<a id='line_5617'>But when Sir Palomides heard the noise and the cry was turned from him,</a>
<a id='line_5618'>he rode out on a part and beheld Sir Tristram. And when Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5619'>saw Sir Tristram do so marvellously well he wept passingly sore for</a>
<a id='line_5620'>despite, for he wist well he should no worship win that day; for well</a>
<a id='line_5621'>knew Sir Palomides, when Sir Tristram would put forth his strength and</a>
<a id='line_5622'>his manhood, be should get but little worship that day.</a>
<a id='line_5623'></a>
<a id='line_5624'></a>
<a id='line_5625'></a>
<a id='line_5626'></a>
<a id='line_5627'>CHAPTER LXXV. How Sir Tristram departed of the field, and awaked Sir</a>
<a id='line_5628'>Dinadan, and changed his array into black.</a>
<a id='line_5629'></a>
<a id='line_5630'></a>
<a id='line_5631'>Then came King Arthur, and the King of Northgalis, and Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_5632'>Lake; and Sir Bleoberis, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, these</a>
<a id='line_5633'>three knights came into the field with Sir Launcelot. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5634'>Launcelot with the three knights of his kin did so great deeds of arms</a>
<a id='line_5635'>that all the noise began upon Sir Launcelot. And so they beat the King</a>
<a id='line_5636'>of Wales and the King of Scots far aback, and made them to avoid the</a>
<a id='line_5637'>field; but Sir Tristram and Sir Gareth abode still in the field and</a>
<a id='line_5638'>endured all that ever there came, that all men had wonder that any</a>
<a id='line_5639'>knight might endure so many strokes. But ever Sir Launcelot, and his</a>
<a id='line_5640'>three kinsmen by the commandment of Sir Launcelot, forbare Sir</a>
<a id='line_5641'>Tristram. Then said Sir Arthur: Is that Sir Palomides that endureth so</a>
<a id='line_5642'>well? Nay, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well it is the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_5643'>Tristram, for yonder ye may see Sir Palomides beholdeth and hoveth, and</a>
<a id='line_5644'>doth little or nought. And sir, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5645'>weeneth this day to beat us all out of the field. And as for me, said</a>
<a id='line_5646'>Sir Launcelot, I shall not beat him, beat him whoso will. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_5647'>Launcelot unto Arthur, ye may see how Sir Palomides hoveth yonder, as</a>
<a id='line_5648'>though he were in a dream; wit ye well he is full heavy that Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5649'>doth such deeds of arms. Then is he but a fool, said Arthur, for never</a>
<a id='line_5650'>was Sir Palomides, nor never shall be, of such prowess as Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_5651'>And if he have any envy at Sir Tristram, and cometh in with him upon</a>
<a id='line_5652'>his side he is a false knight.</a>
<a id='line_5653'></a>
<a id='line_5654'>As the king and Sir Launcelot thus spake, Sir Tristram rode privily out</a>
<a id='line_5655'>of the press, that none espied him but La Beale Isoud and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5656'>Palomides, for they two would not let off their eyes upon Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_5657'>And when Sir Tristram came to his pavilions he found Sir Dinadan in his</a>
<a id='line_5658'>bed asleep. Awake, said Tristram, ye ought to be ashamed so to sleep</a>
<a id='line_5659'>when knights have ado in the field. Then Sir Dinadan arose lightly and</a>
<a id='line_5660'>said: What will ye that I shall do? Make you ready, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5661'>to ride with me into the field. So when Sir Dinadan was armed he looked</a>
<a id='line_5662'>upon Sir Tristram’s helm and on his shield, and when he saw so many</a>
<a id='line_5663'>strokes upon his helm and upon his shield he said: In good time was I</a>
<a id='line_5664'>thus asleep, for had I been with you I must needs for shame there have</a>
<a id='line_5665'>followed you; more for shame than any prowess that is in me; that I see</a>
<a id='line_5666'>well now by those strokes that I should have been truly beaten as I was</a>
<a id='line_5667'>yesterday. Leave your japes, said Sir Tristram, and come off, that [we]</a>
<a id='line_5668'>were in the field again. What, said Sir Dinadan, is your heart up?</a>
<a id='line_5669'>yesterday ye fared as though ye had dreamed. So then Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_5670'>arrayed in black harness. O Jesu, said Dinadan, what aileth you this</a>
<a id='line_5671'>day? meseemeth ye be wilder than ye were yesterday. Then smiled Sir</a>
<a id='line_5672'>Tristram and said to Dinadan: Await well upon me; if ye see me</a>
<a id='line_5673'>overmatched look that ye be ever behind me, and I shall make you ready</a>
<a id='line_5674'>way by God’s grace. So Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan took their horses.</a>
<a id='line_5675'>All this espied Sir Palomides, both their going and their coming, and</a>
<a id='line_5676'>so did La Beale Isoud, for she knew Sir Tristram above all other.</a>
<a id='line_5677'></a>
<a id='line_5678'></a>
<a id='line_5679'></a>
<a id='line_5680'></a>
<a id='line_5681'>CHAPTER LXXVI. How Sir Palomides changed his shield and his armour for</a>
<a id='line_5682'>to hurt Sir Tristram, and how Sir Launcelot did to Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_5683'></a>
<a id='line_5684'></a>
<a id='line_5685'>Then when Sir Palomides saw that Sir Tristram was disguised, then he</a>
<a id='line_5686'>thought to do him a shame. So Sir Palomides rode to a knight that was</a>
<a id='line_5687'>sore wounded, that sat under a fair well from the field. Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_5688'>said Sir Palomides, I pray you to lend me your armour and your shield,</a>
<a id='line_5689'>for mine is over-well known in this field, and that hath done me great</a>
<a id='line_5690'>damage; and ye shall have mine armour and my shield that is as sure as</a>
<a id='line_5691'>yours. I will well, said the knight, that ye have mine armour and my</a>
<a id='line_5692'>shield, if they may do you any avail. So Sir Palomides armed him</a>
<a id='line_5693'>hastily in that knight’s armour and his shield that shone as any</a>
<a id='line_5694'>crystal or silver, and so he came riding into the field. And then there</a>
<a id='line_5695'>was neither Sir Tristram nor none of King Arthur’s party that knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_5696'>Palomides. And right so as Sir Palomides was come into the field Sir</a>
<a id='line_5697'>Tristram smote down three knights, even in the sight of Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_5698'>And then Sir Palomides rode against Sir Tristram, and either met other</a>
<a id='line_5699'>with great spears, that they brast to their hands. And then they dashed</a>
<a id='line_5700'>together with swords eagerly. Then Sir Tristram had marvel what knight</a>
<a id='line_5701'>he was that did battle so knightly with him. Then was Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5702'>wroth, for he felt him passing strong, so that he deemed he might not</a>
<a id='line_5703'>have ado with the remnant of the knights, because of the strength of</a>
<a id='line_5704'>Sir Palomides. So they lashed together and gave many sad strokes</a>
<a id='line_5705'>together, and many knights marvelled what knight he might be that so</a>
<a id='line_5706'>encountered with the black knight, Sir Tristram. Full well knew La</a>
<a id='line_5707'>Beale Isoud that there was Sir Palomides that fought with Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5708'>for she espied all in her window where that she stood, as Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5709'>changed his harness with the wounded knight. And then she began to weep</a>
<a id='line_5710'>so heartily for the despite of Sir Palomides that there she swooned.</a>
<a id='line_5711'></a>
<a id='line_5712'>Then came in Sir Launcelot with the knights of Orkney. And when the</a>
<a id='line_5713'>other party had espied Sir Launcelot, they cried: Return, return, here</a>
<a id='line_5714'>cometh Sir Launcelot du Lake. So there came knights and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_5715'>Launcelot, ye must needs fight with yonder knight in the black harness,</a>
<a id='line_5716'>that was Sir Tristram, for he hath almost overcome that good knight</a>
<a id='line_5717'>that fighteth with him with the silver shield, that was Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_5718'>Then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5719'>Launcelot said to Palomides: Sir knight, let me have the battle, for ye</a>
<a id='line_5720'>have need to be reposed. Sir Palomides knew Sir Launcelot well, and so</a>
<a id='line_5721'>did Sir Tristram, but because Sir Launcelot was far hardier knight than</a>
<a id='line_5722'>himself therefore he was glad, and suffered Sir Launcelot to fight with</a>
<a id='line_5723'>Sir Tristram. For well wist he that Sir Launcelot knew not Sir</a>
<a id='line_5724'>Tristram, and there he hoped that Sir Launcelot should beat or shame</a>
<a id='line_5725'>Sir Tristram, whereof Sir Palomides was full fain. And so Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_5726'>gave Sir Tristram many sad strokes, but Sir Launcelot knew not Sir</a>
<a id='line_5727'>Tristram, but Sir Tristram knew well Sir Launcelot. And thus they</a>
<a id='line_5728'>fought long together, that La Beale Isoud was well-nigh out of her mind</a>
<a id='line_5729'>for sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_5730'></a>
<a id='line_5731'>Then Sir Dinadan told Sir Gareth how that knight in the black harness</a>
<a id='line_5732'>was Sir Tristram: And this is Launcelot that fighteth with him, that</a>
<a id='line_5733'>must needs have the better of him, for Sir Tristram hath had too much</a>
<a id='line_5734'>travail this day. Then let us smite him down, said Sir Gareth. So it is</a>
<a id='line_5735'>better that we do, said Sir Dinadan, than Sir Tristram be shamed, for</a>
<a id='line_5736'>yonder hoveth the strong knight with the silver shield to fall upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_5737'>Tristram if need be. Then forthwithal Gareth rushed upon Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_5738'>and gave him a great stroke upon his helm so hard that he was astonied.</a>
<a id='line_5739'>And then came Sir Dinadan with a spear, and he smote Sir Launcelot such</a>
<a id='line_5740'>a buffet that horse and all fell to the earth. O Jesu, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5741'>Tristram to Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan, fie for shame, why did ye smite</a>
<a id='line_5742'>down so good a knight as he is, and namely when I had ado with him? now</a>
<a id='line_5743'>ye do yourself great shame, and him no disworship; for I held him</a>
<a id='line_5744'>reasonable hot, though ye had not holpen me.</a>
<a id='line_5745'></a>
<a id='line_5746'>Then came Sir Palomides that was disguised, and smote down Sir Dinadan</a>
<a id='line_5747'>from his horse. Then Sir Launcelot, because Sir Dinadan had smitten him</a>
<a id='line_5748'>aforehand, then Sir Launcelot assailed Sir Dinadan passing sore, and</a>
<a id='line_5749'>Sir Dinadan defended him mightily. But well understood Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5750'>that Sir Dinadan might not endure Sir Launcelot, wherefore Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5751'>was sorry. Then came Sir Palomides fresh upon Sir Tristram. And when</a>
<a id='line_5752'>Sir Tristram saw him come, he thought to deliver him at once, because</a>
<a id='line_5753'>that he would help Sir Dinadan, because he stood in great peril with</a>
<a id='line_5754'>Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Tristram hurtled unto Sir Palomides and gave</a>
<a id='line_5755'>him a great buffet, and then Sir Tristram gat Sir Palomides and pulled</a>
<a id='line_5756'>him down underneath him. And so fell Sir Tristram with him; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5757'>Tristram leapt up lightly and left Sir Palomides, and went betwixt Sir</a>
<a id='line_5758'>Launcelot and Dinadan, and then they began to do battle together.</a>
<a id='line_5759'></a>
<a id='line_5760'>Right so Sir Dinadan gat Sir Tristram’s horse, and said on high that</a>
<a id='line_5761'>Sir Launcelot might hear it: My lord Sir Tristram, take your horse. And</a>
<a id='line_5762'>when Sir Launcelot heard him name Sir Tristram: O Jesu, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_5763'>what have I done? I am dishonoured. Ah, my lord Sir Tristram, said</a>
<a id='line_5764'>Launcelot, why were ye disguised? ye have put yourself in great peril</a>
<a id='line_5765'>this day; but I pray you noble knight to pardon me, for an I had known</a>
<a id='line_5766'>you we had not done this battle. Sir, said Sir Tristram, this is not</a>
<a id='line_5767'>the first kindness ye showed me. So they were both horsed again.</a>
<a id='line_5768'></a>
<a id='line_5769'>Then all the people on the one side gave Sir Launcelot the honour and</a>
<a id='line_5770'>the degree, and on the other side all the people gave to the noble</a>
<a id='line_5771'>knight Sir Tristram the honour and the degree; but Launcelot said nay</a>
<a id='line_5772'>thereto: For I am not worthy to have this honour, for I will report me</a>
<a id='line_5773'>unto all knights that Sir Tristram hath been longer in the field than</a>
<a id='line_5774'>I, and he hath smitten down many more knights this day than I have</a>
<a id='line_5775'>done. And therefore I will give Sir Tristram my voice and my name, and</a>
<a id='line_5776'>so I pray all my lords and fellows so to do. Then there was the whole</a>
<a id='line_5777'>voice of dukes and earls, barons and knights, that Sir Tristram this</a>
<a id='line_5778'>day is proved the best knight.</a>
<a id='line_5779'></a>

<a id='line_5783'>CHAPTER LXXVII. How Sir Tristram departed with La Beale Isoud, and how</a>
<a id='line_5784'>Palomides followed and excused him.</a>
<a id='line_5785'></a>
<a id='line_5786'></a>
<a id='line_5787'>Then they blew unto lodging, and Queen Isoud was led unto her</a>
<a id='line_5788'>pavilions. But wit you well she was wroth out of measure with Sir</a>
<a id='line_5789'>Palomides, for she saw all his treason from the beginning to the</a>
<a id='line_5790'>ending. And all this while neither Sir Tristram, neither Sir Gareth nor</a>
<a id='line_5791'>Dinadan, knew not of the treason of Sir Palomides; but afterward ye</a>
<a id='line_5792'>shall hear that there befell the greatest debate betwixt Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_5793'>and Sir Palomides that might be.</a>
<a id='line_5794'></a>
<a id='line_5795'>So when the tournament was done, Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan,</a>
<a id='line_5796'>rode with La Beale Isoud to these pavilions. And ever Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5797'>rode with them in their company disguised as he was. But when Sir</a>
<a id='line_5798'>Tristram had espied him that he was the same knight with the shield of</a>
<a id='line_5799'>silver that held him so hot that day: Sir knight, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5800'>wit ye well here is none that hath need of your fellowship, and</a>
<a id='line_5801'>therefore I pray you depart from us. Sir Palomides answered again as</a>
<a id='line_5802'>though he had not known Sir Tristram: Wit you well, sir knight, from</a>
<a id='line_5803'>this fellowship will I never depart, for one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_5804'>world commanded me to be in this company, and till he discharge me of</a>
<a id='line_5805'>my service I will not be discharged. By that Sir Tristram knew that it</a>
<a id='line_5806'>was Sir Palomides. Ah, Sir Palomides, said the noble knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_5807'>Tristram, are ye such a knight? Ye have been named wrong, for ye have</a>
<a id='line_5808'>long been called a gentle knight, and as this day ye have showed me</a>
<a id='line_5809'>great ungentleness, for ye had almost brought me unto my death. But, as</a>
<a id='line_5810'>for you, I suppose I should have done well enough, but Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_5811'>with you was overmuch; for I know no knight living but Sir Launcelot is</a>
<a id='line_5812'>over good for him, an he will do his uttermost. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5813'>Palomides, are ye my lord Sir Tristram? Yea, sir, and that ye know well</a>
<a id='line_5814'>enough. By my knighthood, said Palomides, until now I knew you not; I</a>
<a id='line_5815'>weened that ye had been the King of Ireland, for well I wot ye bare his</a>
<a id='line_5816'>arms. His arms I bare, said Sir Tristram, and that will I stand by, for</a>
<a id='line_5817'>I won them once in a field of a full noble knight, his name was Sir</a>
<a id='line_5818'>Marhaus; and with great pain I won that knight, for there was none</a>
<a id='line_5819'>other recover, but Sir Marhaus died through false leeches; and yet was</a>
<a id='line_5820'>he never yolden to me. Sir, said Palomides, I weened ye had been turned</a>
<a id='line_5821'>upon Sir Launcelot’s party, and that caused me to turn. Ye say well,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>said Sir Tristram, and so I take you, and I forgive you.</a>
<a id='line_5823'></a>
<a id='line_5824'>So then they rode into their pavilions; and when they were alighted</a>
<a id='line_5825'>they unarmed them and washed their faces and hands, and so yode unto</a>
<a id='line_5826'>meat, and were set at their table. But when Isoud saw Sir Palomides she</a>
<a id='line_5827'>changed then her colours, and for wrath she might not speak. Anon Sir</a>
<a id='line_5828'>Tristram espied her countenance and said: Madam, for what cause make ye</a>
<a id='line_5829'>us such cheer? we have been sore travailed this day. Mine own lord,</a>
<a id='line_5830'>said La Beale Isoud, for God’s sake be ye not displeased with me, for I</a>
<a id='line_5831'>may none otherwise do; for I saw this day how ye were betrayed and nigh</a>
<a id='line_5832'>brought to your death. Truly, sir, I saw every deal, how and in what</a>
<a id='line_5833'>wise, and therefore, sir, how should I suffer in your presence such a</a>
<a id='line_5834'>felon and traitor as Sir Palomides; for I saw him with mine eyes, how</a>
<a id='line_5835'>he beheld you when ye went out of the field. For ever he hoved still</a>
<a id='line_5836'>upon his horse till he saw you come in againward. And then forthwithal</a>
<a id='line_5837'>I saw him ride to the hurt knight, and changed harness with him, and</a>
<a id='line_5838'>then straight I saw him how he rode into the field. And anon as he had</a>
<a id='line_5839'>found you he encountered with you, and thus wilfully Sir Palomides did</a>
<a id='line_5840'>battle with you; and as for him, sir, I was not greatly afraid, but I</a>
<a id='line_5841'>dread sore Launcelot, that knew you not. Madam, said Palomides, ye may</a>
<a id='line_5842'>say whatso ye will, I may not contrary you, but by my knighthood I knew</a>
<a id='line_5843'>not Sir Tristram. Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I will take your</a>
<a id='line_5844'>excuse, but well I wot ye spared me but little, but all is pardoned on</a>
<a id='line_5845'>my part. Then La Beale Isoud held down her head and said no more at</a>
<a id='line_5846'>that time.</a>

<a id='line_5853'></a>
<a id='line_5854'></a>
<a id='line_5855'>And therewithal two knights armed came unto the pavilion, and there</a>
<a id='line_5856'>they alighted both, and came in armed at all pieces. Fair knights, said</a>
<a id='line_5857'>Sir Tristram, ye are to blame to come thus armed at all pieces upon me</a>
<a id='line_5858'>while we are at our meat; if ye would anything when we were in the</a>

<a id='line_5862'>the one, for to see you, and this knight is come for to see La Beale</a>
<a id='line_5863'>Isoud. Then said Sir Tristram: I require you do off your helms that I</a>
<a id='line_5864'>may see you. That will we do at your desire, said the knights. And when</a>
<a id='line_5865'>their helms were off, Sir Tristram thought that he should know them.</a>
<a id='line_5866'></a>
<a id='line_5867'>Then said Sir Dinadan privily unto Sir Tristram: Sir, that is Sir</a>
<a id='line_5868'>Launcelot du Lake that spake unto you first, and the other is my lord</a>
<a id='line_5869'>King Arthur. Then, said Sir Tristram unto La Beale Isoud, Madam arise,</a>
<a id='line_5870'>for here is my lord, King Arthur. Then the king and the queen kissed,</a>
<a id='line_5871'>and Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram braced either other in arms, and</a>
<a id='line_5872'>then there was joy without measure; and at the request of La Beale</a>
<a id='line_5873'>Isoud, King Arthur and Launcelot were unarmed, and then there was merry</a>
<a id='line_5874'>talking. Madam, said Sir Arthur, it is many a day sithen that I have</a>
<a id='line_5875'>desired to see you, for ye have been praised so far; and now I dare say</a>
<a id='line_5876'>ye are the fairest that ever I saw, and Sir Tristram is as fair and as</a>
<a id='line_5877'>good a knight as any that I know; therefore me beseemeth ye are well</a>
<a id='line_5878'>beset together. Sir, God thank you, said the noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_5879'>Tristram, and Isoud; of your great goodness and largess ye are</a>
<a id='line_5880'>peerless. Thus they talked of many things and of all the whole jousts.</a>
<a id='line_5881'>But for what cause, said King Arthur, were ye, Sir Tristram, against</a>
<a id='line_5882'>us? Ye are a knight of the Table Round; of right ye should have been</a>
<a id='line_5883'>with us. Sir, said Sir Tristram, here is Dinadan, and Sir Gareth your</a>
<a id='line_5884'>own nephew, caused me to be against you. My lord Arthur, said Gareth, I</a>
<a id='line_5885'>may well bear the blame, but it were Sir Tristram’s own deeds. That may</a>
<a id='line_5886'>I repent, said Dinadan, for this unhappy Sir Tristram brought us to</a>
<a id='line_5887'>this tournament, and many great buffets he caused us to have. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5888'>king and Launcelot laughed that they might not sit.</a>
<a id='line_5889'></a>
<a id='line_5890'>What knight was that, said Arthur, that held you so short, this with</a>
<a id='line_5891'>the shield of silver? Sir, said Sir Tristram, here he sitteth at this</a>
<a id='line_5892'>board. What, said Arthur, was it Sir Palomides? Wit ye well it was he,</a>
<a id='line_5893'>said La Beale Isoud. So God me help, said Arthur, that was unknightly</a>
<a id='line_5894'>done of you of so good a knight, for I have heard many people call you</a>
<a id='line_5895'>a courteous knight. Sir, said Palomides, I knew not Sir Tristram, for</a>
<a id='line_5896'>he was so disguised. So God me help, said Launcelot, it may well be,</a>
<a id='line_5897'>for I knew not Sir Tristram; but I marvel why ye turned on our party.</a>
<a id='line_5898'>That was done for the same cause, said Launcelot. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_5899'>Tristram, I have pardoned him, and I would be right loath to leave his</a>
<a id='line_5900'>fellowship, for I love right well his company: so they left off and</a>
<a id='line_5901'>talked of other things.</a>
<a id='line_5902'></a>
<a id='line_5903'>And in the evening King Arthur and Sir Launcelot departed unto their</a>
<a id='line_5904'>lodging; but wit ye well Sir Palomides had envy heartily, for all that</a>
<a id='line_5905'>night he had never rest in his bed, but wailed and wept out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_5906'>So on the morn Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan arose early, and then</a>
<a id='line_5907'>they went unto Sir Palomides’ chamber, and there they found him fast</a>
<a id='line_5908'>asleep, for he had all night watched, and it was seen upon his cheeks</a>
<a id='line_5909'>that he had wept full sore. Say nothing, said Sir Tristram, for I am</a>
<a id='line_5910'>sure he hath taken anger and sorrow for the rebuke that I gave to him,</a>
<a id='line_5911'>and La Beale Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_5912'></a>
<a id='line_5913'></a>
<a id='line_5914'></a>
<a id='line_5915'></a>
<a id='line_5916'>CHAPTER LXXIX. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides did the next day, and</a>
<a id='line_5917'>how King Arthur was unhorsed.</a>
<a id='line_5918'></a>
<a id='line_5919'></a>
<a id='line_5920'>Then Sir Tristram let call Sir Palomides, and bade him make him ready,</a>
<a id='line_5921'>for it was time to go to the field. When they were ready they were</a>
<a id='line_5922'>armed, and clothed all in red, both Isoud and all they; and so they led</a>
<a id='line_5923'>her passing freshly through the field, into the priory where was her</a>
<a id='line_5924'>lodging. And then they heard three blasts blow, and every king and</a>
<a id='line_5925'>knight dressed him unto the field. And the first that was ready to</a>
<a id='line_5926'>joust was Sir Palomides and Sir Kainus le Strange, a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_5927'>Table Round. And so they two encountered together, but Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5928'>smote Sir Kainus so hard that he smote him quite over his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_5929'>croup. And forthwithal Sir Palomides smote down another knight, and</a>
<a id='line_5930'>brake then his spear, and pulled out his sword and did wonderly well.</a>
<a id='line_5931'>And then the noise began greatly upon Sir Palomides. Lo, said King</a>
<a id='line_5932'>Arthur, yonder Palomides beginneth to play his pageant. So God me help,</a>
<a id='line_5933'>said Arthur, he is a passing good knight. And right as they stood</a>
<a id='line_5934'>talking thus, in came Sir Tristram as thunder, and he encountered with</a>
<a id='line_5935'>Sir Kay the Seneschal, and there he smote him down quite from his</a>
<a id='line_5936'>horse; and with that same spear Sir Tristram smote down three knights</a>
<a id='line_5937'>more, and then he pulled out his sword and did marvellously. Then the</a>
<a id='line_5938'>noise and cry changed from Sir Palomides and turned to Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_5939'>and all the people cried: O Tristram, O Tristram. And then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_5940'>Palomides clean forgotten.</a>
<a id='line_5941'></a>
<a id='line_5942'>How now, said Launcelot unto Arthur, yonder rideth a knight that</a>
<a id='line_5943'>playeth his pageants. So God me help, said Arthur to Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_5944'>shall see this day that yonder two knights shall here do this day</a>
<a id='line_5945'>wonders. Sir, said Launcelot, the one knight waiteth upon the other,</a>
<a id='line_5946'>and enforceth himself through envy to pass the noble knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_5947'>Tristram, and he knoweth not of the privy envy the which Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_5948'>hath to him; for all that the noble Sir Tristram doth is through clean</a>
<a id='line_5949'>knighthood. And then Sir Gareth and Dinadan did wonderly great deeds of</a>
<a id='line_5950'>arms, as two noble knights, so that King Arthur spake of them great</a>
<a id='line_5951'>honour and worship; and the kings and knights of Sir Tristram’s side</a>
<a id='line_5952'>did passingly well, and held them truly together. Then Sir Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_5953'>Sir Launcelot took their horses and dressed them, and gat into the</a>
<a id='line_5954'>thickest of the press. And there Sir Tristram unknowing smote down King</a>
<a id='line_5955'>Arthur, and then Sir Launcelot would have rescued him, but there were</a>
<a id='line_5956'>so many upon Sir Launcelot that they pulled him down from his horse.</a>
<a id='line_5957'>And then the King of Ireland and the King of Scots with their knights</a>
<a id='line_5958'>did their pain to take King Arthur and Sir Launcelot prisoner. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_5959'>Launcelot heard them say so, he fared as it had been an hungry lion,</a>
<a id='line_5960'>for he fared so that no knight durst nigh him.</a>
<a id='line_5961'></a>
<a id='line_5962'>Then came Sir Ector de Maris, and he bare a spear against Sir</a>
<a id='line_5963'>Palomides, and brast it upon him all to shivers. And then Sir Ector</a>
<a id='line_5964'>came again and gave Sir Palomides such a dash with a sword that he</a>
<a id='line_5965'>stooped down upon his saddle bow. And forthwithal Sir Ector pulled down</a>
<a id='line_5966'>Sir Palomides under his feet; and then Sir Ector de Maris gat Sir</a>
<a id='line_5967'>Launcelot du Lake an horse, and brought it to him, and bade him mount</a>
<a id='line_5968'>upon him; but Sir Palomides leapt afore and gat the horse by the</a>
<a id='line_5969'>bridle, and leapt into the saddle. So God me help, said Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_5970'>are better worthy to have that horse than I. Then Sir Ector brought Sir</a>
<a id='line_5971'>Launcelot another horse. Gramercy, said Launcelot unto his brother. And</a>
<a id='line_5972'>so when he was horsed again, with one spear he smote down four knights.</a>
<a id='line_5973'>And then Sir Launcelot brought to King Arthur one of the best of the</a>
<a id='line_5974'>four horses. Then Sir Launcelot with King Arthur and a few of his</a>
<a id='line_5975'>knights of Sir Launcelot’s kin did marvellous deeds; for that time, as</a>
<a id='line_5976'>the book recordeth, Sir Launcelot smote down and pulled down thirty</a>
<a id='line_5977'>knights. Notwithstanding the other party held them so fast together</a>
<a id='line_5978'>that King Arthur and his knights were overmatched. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_5979'>Tristram saw that, what labour King Arthur and his knights, and in</a>
<a id='line_5980'>especial the noble deeds that Sir Launcelot did with his own hands, he</a>
<a id='line_5981'>marvelled greatly.</a>
<a id='line_5982'></a>
<a id='line_5983'></a>
<a id='line_5984'></a>
<a id='line_5985'></a>
<a id='line_5986'>CHAPTER LXXX. How Sir Tristram turned to King Arthur’s side, and how</a>
<a id='line_5987'>Palomides would not.</a>
<a id='line_5988'></a>
<a id='line_5989'></a>
<a id='line_5990'>Then Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Palomides, Sir Gareth, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_5991'>Dinadan, and said thus to them: My fair fellows, wit ye well that I</a>
<a id='line_5992'>will turn unto King Arthur’s party, for I saw never so few men do so</a>
<a id='line_5993'>well, and it will be shame unto us knights that be of the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_5994'>to see our lord King Arthur, and that noble knight Sir Launcelot, to be</a>
<a id='line_5995'>dishonoured. It will be well done, said Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan. Do</a>
<a id='line_5996'>your best, said Palomides, for I will not change my party that I came</a>
<a id='line_5997'>in withal. That is for my sake, said Sir Tristram; God speed you in</a>
<a id='line_5998'>your journey. And so departed Sir Palomides from them. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_5999'>Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan, turned with Sir Launcelot. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6000'>Launcelot smote down the King of Ireland quite from his horse; and so</a>
<a id='line_6001'>Sir Launcelot smote down the King of Scots, and the King of Wales; and</a>
<a id='line_6002'>then Sir Arthur ran unto Sir Palomides and smote him quite from his</a>
<a id='line_6003'>horse; and then Sir Tristram bare down all that he met. Sir Gareth and</a>
<a id='line_6004'>Sir Dinadan did there as noble knights; then all the parties began to</a>
<a id='line_6005'>flee. Alas, said Palomides, that ever I should see this day, for now</a>
<a id='line_6006'>have I lost all the worship that I won; and then Sir Palomides went his</a>
<a id='line_6007'>way wailing, and so withdrew him till he came to a well, and there he</a>
<a id='line_6008'>put his horse from him, and did off his armour, and wailed and wept</a>
<a id='line_6009'>like as he had been a wood man. Then many knights gave the prize to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6010'>Tristram, and there were many that gave the prize unto Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6011'>Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, I thank you of the honour ye would give</a>
<a id='line_6012'>me, but I pray you heartily that ye would give your voice to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6013'>Launcelot, for by my faith said Sir Tristram, I will give Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6014'>my voice. But Sir Launcelot would not have it, and so the prize was</a>
<a id='line_6015'>given betwixt them both.</a>
<a id='line_6016'></a>
<a id='line_6017'>Then every man rode to his lodging, and Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector</a>
<a id='line_6018'>rode with Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud unto their pavilions. Then as</a>
<a id='line_6019'>Sir Palomides was at the well wailing and weeping, there came by him</a>
<a id='line_6020'>flying the kings of Wales and of Scotland, and they saw Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6021'>in that arage. Alas, said they, that so noble a man as ye be should be</a>
<a id='line_6022'>in this array. And then those kings gat Sir Palomides’ horse again, and</a>
<a id='line_6023'>made him to arm him and mount upon his horse, and so he rode with them,</a>
<a id='line_6024'>making great dole. So when Sir Palomides came nigh the pavilions</a>
<a id='line_6025'>thereas Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud was in, then Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6026'>prayed the two kings to abide him there the while that he spake with</a>
<a id='line_6027'>Sir Tristram. And when he came to the port of the pavilions, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6028'>Palomides said on high: Where art thou, Sir Tristram de Liones? Sir,</a>
<a id='line_6029'>said Dinadan, that is Palomides. What, Sir Palomides, will ye not come</a>
<a id='line_6030'>in here among us? Fie on thee traitor, said Palomides, for wit you well</a>
<a id='line_6031'>an it were daylight as it is night I should slay thee, mine own hands.</a>
<a id='line_6032'>And if ever I may get thee, said Palomides, thou shalt die for this</a>
<a id='line_6033'>day’s deed. Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, ye wite me with wrong,</a>
<a id='line_6034'>for had ye done as I did ye had won worship. But sithen ye give me so</a>
<a id='line_6035'>large warning I shall be well ware of you. Fie on thee, traitor, said</a>
<a id='line_6036'>Palomides, and therewith departed.</a>
<a id='line_6037'></a>
<a id='line_6038'>Then on the morn Sir Tristram, Bleoberis, and Sir Ector de Maris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6039'>Gareth, Sir Dinadan, what by water and what by land, they brought La</a>
<a id='line_6040'>Beale Isoud unto Joyous Gard, and there reposed them a seven night, and</a>
<a id='line_6041'>made all the mirths and disports that they could devise. And King</a>
<a id='line_6042'>Arthur and his knights drew unto Camelot, and Sir Palomides rode with</a>
<a id='line_6043'>the two kings; and ever he made the greatest dole that any man could</a>
<a id='line_6044'>think, for he was not all only so dolorous for the departing from La</a>
<a id='line_6045'>Beale Isoud, but he was a part as sorrowful to depart from the</a>
<a id='line_6046'>fellowship of Sir Tristram; for Sir Tristram was so kind and so gentle</a>
<a id='line_6047'>that when Sir Palomides remembered him thereof he might never be merry.</a>
<a id='line_6048'></a>
<a id='line_6049'></a>

<a id='line_6052'>CHAPTER LXXXI. How Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector reported to Queen</a>
<a id='line_6053'>Guenever of the beauty of La Beale Isoud.</a>
<a id='line_6054'></a>
<a id='line_6055'></a>
<a id='line_6056'>So at the seven nights’ end Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector departed from</a>
<a id='line_6057'>Sir Tristram and from the queen; and these two good knights had great</a>
<a id='line_6058'>gifts; and Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan abode with Sir Tristram. And when</a>
<a id='line_6059'>Sir Bleoberis and Sir Ector were come there as the Queen Guenever was</a>
<a id='line_6060'>lodged, in a castle by the seaside, and through the grace of God the</a>
<a id='line_6061'>queen was recovered of her malady, then she asked the two knights from</a>
<a id='line_6062'>whence they came. They said that they came from Sir Tristram and from</a>
<a id='line_6063'>La Beale Isoud. How doth Sir Tristram, said the queen, and La Beale</a>
<a id='line_6064'>Isoud? Truly, said those two knights, he doth as a noble knight should</a>
<a id='line_6065'>do; and as for the Queen Isoud, she is peerless of all ladies; for to</a>
<a id='line_6066'>speak of her beauty, bounté, and mirth, and of her goodness, we saw</a>
<a id='line_6067'>never her match as far as we have ridden and gone. O mercy Jesu, said</a>
<a id='line_6068'>Queen Guenever, so saith all the people that have seen her and spoken</a>
<a id='line_6069'>with her. God would that I had part of her conditions; and it is</a>
<a id='line_6070'>misfortuned me of my sickness while that tournament endured. And as I</a>
<a id='line_6071'>suppose I shall never see in all my life such an assembly of knights</a>
<a id='line_6072'>and ladies as ye have done.</a>
<a id='line_6073'></a>
<a id='line_6074'>Then the knights told her how Palomides won the degree at the first day</a>
<a id='line_6075'>with great noblesse; and the second day Sir Tristram won the degree;</a>
<a id='line_6076'>and the third day Sir Launcelot won the degree. Well, said Queen</a>
<a id='line_6077'>Guenever, who did best all these three days? So God me help, said these</a>
<a id='line_6078'>knights, Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram had least dishonour. And wit ye</a>
<a id='line_6079'>well Sir Palomides did passing well and mightily; but he turned against</a>
<a id='line_6080'>the party that he came in withal, and that caused him to lose a great</a>
<a id='line_6081'>part of his worship, for it seemed that Sir Palomides is passing</a>
<a id='line_6082'>envious. Then shall he never win worship, said Queen Guenever, for an</a>
<a id='line_6083'>it happeth an envious man once to win worship he shall be dishonoured</a>
<a id='line_6084'>twice therefore; and for this cause all men of worship hate an envious</a>
<a id='line_6085'>man, and will shew him no favour, and he that is courteous, and kind,</a>
<a id='line_6086'>and gentle, hath favour in every place.</a>

<a id='line_6091'>CHAPTER LXXXII. How Epinogris complained by a well, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_6092'>Palomides came and found him, and of their both sorrowing.</a>
<a id='line_6093'></a>
<a id='line_6094'></a>
<a id='line_6095'>Now leave we of this matter and speak we of Sir Palomides, that rode</a>
<a id='line_6096'>and lodged him with the two kings, whereof the kings were heavy. Then</a>
<a id='line_6097'>the King of Ireland sent a man of his to Sir Palomides, and gave him a</a>
<a id='line_6098'>great courser, and the King of Scotland gave him great gifts; and fain</a>
<a id='line_6099'>they would have had Sir Palomides to have abiden with them, but in no</a>
<a id='line_6100'>wise he would abide; and so he departed, and rode as adventures would</a>
<a id='line_6101'>guide him, till it was nigh noon. And then in a forest by a well Sir</a>
<a id='line_6102'>Palomides saw where lay a fair wounded knight and his horse bounden by</a>
<a id='line_6103'>him; and that knight made the greatest dole that ever he heard man</a>
<a id='line_6104'>make, for ever he wept, and therewith he sighed as though he would die.</a>
<a id='line_6105'>Then Sir Palomides rode near him and saluted him mildly and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_6106'>knight, why wail ye so? let me lie down and wail with you, for doubt</a>
<a id='line_6107'>not I am much more heavier than ye are; for I dare say, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_6108'>that my sorrow is an hundred fold more than yours is, and therefore let</a>
<a id='line_6109'>us complain either to other. First, said the wounded knight, I require</a>
<a id='line_6110'>you tell me your name, for an thou be none of the noble knights of the</a>
<a id='line_6111'>Round Table thou shalt never know my name, whatsomever come of me. Fair</a>
<a id='line_6112'>knight, said Palomides, such as I am, be it better or be it worse, wit</a>
<a id='line_6113'>thou well that my name is Sir Palomides, son and heir unto King</a>
<a id='line_6114'>Astlabor, and Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides are my two brethren; and</a>
<a id='line_6115'>wit thou well as for myself I was never christened, but my two brethren</a>
<a id='line_6116'>are truly christened. O noble knight, said that knight, well is me that</a>
<a id='line_6117'>I have met with you; and wit ye well my name is Epinogris, the king’s</a>
<a id='line_6118'>son of Northumberland. Now sit down, said Epinogris, and let us either</a>
<a id='line_6119'>complain to other.</a>
<a id='line_6120'></a>
<a id='line_6121'>Then Sir Palomides began his complaint. Now shall I tell you, said</a>
<a id='line_6122'>Palomides, what woe I endure. I love the fairest queen and lady that</a>
<a id='line_6123'>ever bare life, and wit ye well her name is La Beale Isoud, King Mark’s</a>
<a id='line_6124'>wife of Cornwall. That is great folly, said Epinogris, for to love</a>
<a id='line_6125'>Queen Isoud, for one of the best knights of the world loveth her, that</a>
<a id='line_6126'>is Sir Tristram de Liones. That is truth, said Palomides, for no man</a>
<a id='line_6127'>knoweth that matter better than I do, for I have been in Sir Tristram’s</a>
<a id='line_6128'>fellowship this month, and with La Beale Isoud together; and alas, said</a>
<a id='line_6129'>Palomides, unhappy man that I am, now have I lost the fellowship of Sir</a>
<a id='line_6130'>Tristram for ever, and the love of La Beale Isoud for ever, and I am</a>
<a id='line_6131'>never like to see her more, and Sir Tristram and I be either to other</a>
<a id='line_6132'>mortal enemies. Well, said Epinogris, sith that ye loved La Beale</a>
<a id='line_6133'>Isoud, loved she you ever again by anything that ye could think or wit,</a>
<a id='line_6134'>or else did ye rejoice her ever in any pleasure? Nay, by my knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_6135'>said Palomides, I never espied that ever she loved me more than all the</a>
<a id='line_6136'>world, nor never had I pleasure with her, but the last day she gave me</a>
<a id='line_6137'>the greatest rebuke that ever I had, the which shall never go from my</a>
<a id='line_6138'>heart. And yet I well deserved that rebuke, for I did not knightly, and</a>
<a id='line_6139'>therefore I have lost the love of her and of Sir Tristram for ever; and</a>
<a id='line_6140'>I have many times enforced myself to do many deeds for La Beale Isoud’s</a>
<a id='line_6141'>sake, and she was the causer of my worship-winning. Alas, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6142'>Palomides, now have I lost all the worship that ever I won, for never</a>
<a id='line_6143'>shall me befall such prowess as I had in the fellowship of Sir</a>
<a id='line_6144'>Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_6145'></a>
<a id='line_6146'></a>
<a id='line_6147'></a>
<a id='line_6148'></a>
<a id='line_6149'>CHAPTER LXXXIII. How Sir Palomides brought Sir Epinogris his lady; and</a>
<a id='line_6150'>how Sir Palomides and Sir Safere were assailed.</a>
<a id='line_6151'></a>
<a id='line_6152'></a>
<a id='line_6153'>Nay, nay, said Epinogris, your sorrow is but japes to my sorrow; for I</a>
<a id='line_6154'>rejoiced my lady and won her with my hands, and lost her again: alas</a>
<a id='line_6155'>that day! Thus first I won her, said Epinogris; my lady was an earl’s</a>
<a id='line_6156'>daughter, and as the earl and two knights came from the tournament of</a>
<a id='line_6157'>Lonazep, for her sake I set upon this earl and on his two knights, my</a>
<a id='line_6158'>lady there being present; and so by fortune there I slew the earl and</a>
<a id='line_6159'>one of the knights, and the other knight fled, and so that night I had</a>
<a id='line_6160'>my lady. And on the morn as she and I reposed us at this well-side</a>
<a id='line_6161'>there came there to me an errant knight, his name was Sir Helior le</a>
<a id='line_6162'>Preuse, an hardy knight, and this Sir Helior challenged me to fight for</a>
<a id='line_6163'>my lady. And then we went to battle first upon horse and after on foot,</a>
<a id='line_6164'>but at the last Sir Helior wounded me so that he left me for dead, and</a>
<a id='line_6165'>so he took my lady with him; and thus my sorrow is more than yours, for</a>
<a id='line_6166'>I have rejoiced and ye rejoiced never. That is truth, said Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_6167'>but sith I can never recover myself I shall promise you if I can meet</a>
<a id='line_6168'>with Sir Helior I shall get you your lady again, or else he shall beat</a>
<a id='line_6169'>me.</a>
<a id='line_6170'></a>
<a id='line_6171'>Then Sir Palomides made Sir Epinogris to take his horse, and so they</a>
<a id='line_6172'>rode to an hermitage, and there Sir Epinogris rested him. And in the</a>
<a id='line_6173'>meanwhile Sir Palomides walked privily out to rest him under the</a>
<a id='line_6174'>leaves, and there beside he saw a knight come riding with a shield that</a>
<a id='line_6175'>he had seen Sir Ector de Maris bear beforehand; and there came after</a>
<a id='line_6176'>him a ten knights, and so these ten knights hoved under the leaves for</a>
<a id='line_6177'>heat. And anon after there came a knight with a green shield and</a>
<a id='line_6178'>therein a white lion, leading a lady upon a palfrey. Then this knight</a>
<a id='line_6179'>with the green shield that seemed to be master of the ten knights, he</a>
<a id='line_6180'>rode fiercely after Sir Helior, for it was he that hurt Sir Epinogris.</a>
<a id='line_6181'>And when he came nigh Sir Helior he bade him defend his lady. I will</a>
<a id='line_6182'>defend her, said Helior, unto my power. And so they ran together so</a>
<a id='line_6183'>mightily that either of these knights smote other down, horse and all,</a>
<a id='line_6184'>to the earth; and then they won up lightly and drew their swords and</a>
<a id='line_6185'>their shields, and lashed together mightily more than an hour. All this</a>
<a id='line_6186'>Sir Palomides saw and beheld, but ever at the last the knight with Sir</a>
<a id='line_6187'>Ector’s shield was bigger, and at the last this knight smote Sir Helior</a>
<a id='line_6188'>down, and then that knight unlaced his helm to have stricken off his</a>
<a id='line_6189'>head. And then he cried mercy, and prayed him to save his life, and</a>
<a id='line_6190'>bade him take his lady. Then Sir Palomides dressed him up, because he</a>
<a id='line_6191'>wist well that that same lady was Epinogris’ lady, and he promised him</a>
<a id='line_6192'>to help him.</a>
<a id='line_6193'></a>
<a id='line_6194'>Then Sir Palomides went straight to that lady, and took her by the</a>
<a id='line_6195'>hand, and asked her whether she knew a knight that hight Epinogris.</a>
<a id='line_6196'>Alas, she said, that ever he knew me or I him, for I have for his sake</a>
<a id='line_6197'>lost my worship, and also his life grieveth me most of all. Not so,</a>
<a id='line_6198'>lady, said Palomides, come on with me, for here is Epinogris in this</a>
<a id='line_6199'>hermitage. Ah! well is me, said the lady, an he be alive. Whither wilt</a>
<a id='line_6200'>thou with that lady? said the knight with Sir Ector’s shield. I will do</a>
<a id='line_6201'>with her what me list, said Palomides. Wit you well, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_6202'>thou speakest over large, though thou seemest me to have at advantage,</a>
<a id='line_6203'>because thou sawest me do battle but late. Thou weenest, sir knight, to</a>
<a id='line_6204'>have that lady away from me so lightly? nay, think it never not; an</a>
<a id='line_6205'>thou were as good a knight as is Sir Launcelot, or as is Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_6206'>or Sir Palomides, but thou shalt win her dearer than ever did I. And so</a>
<a id='line_6207'>they went unto battle upon foot, and there they gave many sad strokes,</a>
<a id='line_6208'>and either wounded other passing sore, and thus they fought still more</a>
<a id='line_6209'>than an hour.</a>
<a id='line_6210'></a>
<a id='line_6211'>Then Sir Palomides had marvel what knight he might be that was so</a>
<a id='line_6212'>strong and so well breathed during, and thus said Palomides: Knight, I</a>
<a id='line_6213'>require thee tell me thy name. Wit thou well, said that knight, I dare</a>
<a id='line_6214'>tell thee my name, so that thou wilt tell me thy name. I will, said</a>
<a id='line_6215'>Palomides. Truly, said that knight, my name is Safere, son of King</a>
<a id='line_6216'>Astlabor, and Sir Palomides and Sir Segwarides are my brethren. Now,</a>
<a id='line_6217'>and wit thou well, my name is Sir Palomides. Then Sir Safere kneeled</a>
<a id='line_6218'>down upon his knees, and prayed him of mercy; and then they unlaced</a>
<a id='line_6219'>their helms and either kissed other weeping. And in the meanwhile Sir</a>
<a id='line_6220'>Epinogris arose out of his bed, and heard them by the strokes, and so</a>
<a id='line_6221'>he armed him to help Sir Palomides if need were.</a>
<a id='line_6222'></a>
<a id='line_6223'></a>
<a id='line_6224'></a>
<a id='line_6225'></a>
<a id='line_6226'>CHAPTER LXXXIV. How Sir Palomides and Sir Safere conducted Sir</a>
<a id='line_6227'>Epinogris to his castle, and of other adventures.</a>
<a id='line_6228'></a>
<a id='line_6229'></a>
<a id='line_6230'>Then Sir Palomides took the lady by the hand and brought her to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6231'>Epinogris, and there was great joy betwixt them, for either swooned for</a>
<a id='line_6232'>joy. When they were met: Fair knight and lady, said Sir Safere, it were</a>
<a id='line_6233'>pity to depart you; Jesu send you joy either of other. Gramercy, gentle</a>
<a id='line_6234'>knight, said Epinogris; and much more thanks be to my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_6235'>Palomides, that thus hath through his prowess made me to get my lady.</a>
<a id='line_6236'>Then Sir Epinogris required Sir Palomides and Sir Safere, his brother,</a>
<a id='line_6237'>to ride with them unto his castle, for the safeguard of his person.</a>
<a id='line_6238'>Sir, said Palomides, we will be ready to conduct you because that ye</a>
<a id='line_6239'>are sore wounded; and so was Epinogris and his lady horsed, and his</a>
<a id='line_6240'>lady behind him upon a soft ambler. And then they rode unto his castle,</a>
<a id='line_6241'>where they had great cheer and joy, as great as ever Sir Palomides and</a>
<a id='line_6242'>Sir Safere had in their life-days.</a>
<a id='line_6243'></a>
<a id='line_6244'>So on the morn Sir Safere and Sir Palomides departed, day until after</a>
<a id='line_6245'>noon. And at the last they heard a great weeping and a great noise down</a>
<a id='line_6246'>in a manor. Sir, said then Sir Safere, let us wit what noise this is. I</a>
<a id='line_6247'>will well, said Sir Palomides. And so they rode forth till that they</a>
<a id='line_6248'>came to a fair gate of a manor, and there sat an old man saying his</a>
<a id='line_6249'>prayers and beads. Then Sir Palomides and Sir Safere alighted and left</a>
<a id='line_6250'>their horses, and went within the gates, and there they saw full many</a>
<a id='line_6251'>goodly men weeping. Fair sirs, said Palomides, wherefore weep ye and</a>
<a id='line_6252'>make this sorrow? Anon one of the knights of the castle beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_6253'>Palomides and knew him, and then went to his fellows and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_6254'>fellows, wit ye well all, we have in this castle the same knight that</a>
<a id='line_6255'>slew our lord at Lonazep, for I know him well; it is Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_6256'>Then they went unto harness, all that might bear harness, some on</a>
<a id='line_6257'>horseback and some on foot, to the number of three score. And when they</a>
<a id='line_6258'>were ready they came freshly upon Sir Palomides and upon Sir Safere</a>
<a id='line_6259'>with a great noise, and said thus: Keep thee, Sir Palomides, for thou</a>
<a id='line_6260'>art known, and by right thou must be dead, for thou hast slain our</a>
<a id='line_6261'>lord; and therefore wit ye well we will slay thee, therefore defend</a>
<a id='line_6262'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_6263'></a>
<a id='line_6264'>Then Sir Palomides and Sir Safere, the one set his back to the other,</a>
<a id='line_6265'>and gave many great strokes, and took many great strokes; and thus they</a>
<a id='line_6266'>fought with a twenty knights and forty gentlemen and yeomen nigh two</a>
<a id='line_6267'>hours. But at the last though they were loath, Sir Palomides and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6268'>Safere were taken and yolden, and put in a strong prison; and within</a>
<a id='line_6269'>three days twelve knights passed upon them, and they found Sir</a>
<a id='line_6270'>Palomides guilty, and Sir Safere not guilty, of their lord’s death. And</a>
<a id='line_6271'>when Sir Safere should be delivered there was great dole betwixt Sir</a>
<a id='line_6272'>Palomides and him, and many piteous complaints that Sir Safere made at</a>
<a id='line_6273'>his departing, there is no maker can rehearse the tenth part. Fair</a>
<a id='line_6274'>brother, said Palomides, let be thy dolour and thy sorrow. And if I be</a>
<a id='line_6275'>ordained to die a shameful death, welcome be it; but an I had wist of</a>
<a id='line_6276'>this death that I am deemed unto, I should never have been yolden. So</a>
<a id='line_6277'>Sir Safere departed from his brother with the greatest dolour and</a>
<a id='line_6278'>sorrow that ever made knight.</a>
<a id='line_6279'></a>
<a id='line_6280'>And on the morn they of the castle ordained twelve knights to ride with</a>
<a id='line_6281'>Sir Palomides unto the father of the same knight that Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6282'>slew; and so they bound his legs under an old steed’s belly. And then</a>
<a id='line_6283'>they rode with Sir Palomides unto a castle by the seaside, that hight</a>
<a id='line_6284'>Pelownes, and there Sir Palomides should have justice. Thus was their</a>
<a id='line_6285'>ordinance; and so they rode with Sir Palomides fast by the castle of</a>
<a id='line_6286'>Joyous Gard. And as they passed by that castle there came riding out of</a>
<a id='line_6287'>that castle by them one that knew Sir Palomides. And when that knight</a>
<a id='line_6288'>saw Sir Palomides bounden upon a crooked courser, the knight asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_6289'>Palomides for what cause he was led so. Ah, my fair fellow and knight,</a>
<a id='line_6290'>said Palomides, I ride toward my death for the slaying of a knight at a</a>
<a id='line_6291'>tournament of Lonazep; and if I had not departed from my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_6292'>Tristram, as I ought not to have done, now might I have been sure to</a>
<a id='line_6293'>have had my life saved; but I pray you, sir knight, recommend me unto</a>
<a id='line_6294'>my lord, Sir Tristram, and unto my lady, Queen Isoud, and say to them</a>
<a id='line_6295'>if ever I trespassed to them I ask them forgiveness. And also I beseech</a>
<a id='line_6296'>you recommend me unto my lord, King Arthur, and to all the fellowship</a>
<a id='line_6297'>of the Round Table, unto my power. Then that knight wept for pity of</a>
<a id='line_6298'>Sir Palomides; and therewithal he rode unto Joyous Gard as fast as his</a>
<a id='line_6299'>horse might run, and lightly that knight descended down off his horse</a>
<a id='line_6300'>and went unto Sir Tristram, and there he told him all as ye have heard,</a>
<a id='line_6301'>and ever the knight wept as he had been mad.</a>
<a id='line_6302'></a>
<a id='line_6303'></a>
<a id='line_6304'></a>
<a id='line_6305'></a>
<a id='line_6306'>CHAPTER LXXXV. How Sir Tristram made him ready to rescue Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_6307'>but Sir Launcelot rescued him or he came.</a>
<a id='line_6308'></a>
<a id='line_6309'></a>
<a id='line_6310'>When Sir Tristram heard how Sir Palomides went to his death, he was</a>
<a id='line_6311'>heavy to hear that, and said: Howbeit that I am wroth with Sir</a>
<a id='line_6312'>Palomides, yet will not I suffer him to die so shameful a death, for he</a>
<a id='line_6313'>is a full noble knight. And then anon Sir Tristram was armed and took</a>
<a id='line_6314'>his horse and two squires with him, and rode a great pace toward the</a>
<a id='line_6315'>castle of Pelownes where Sir Palomides was judged to death. And these</a>
<a id='line_6316'>twelve knights that led Sir Palomides passed by a well whereas Sir</a>
<a id='line_6317'>Launcelot was, which was alighted there, and had tied his horse to a</a>
<a id='line_6318'>tree, and taken off his helm to drink of that well; and when he saw</a>
<a id='line_6319'>these knights, Sir Launcelot put on his helm and suffered them to pass</a>
<a id='line_6320'>by him. And then was he ware of Sir Palomides bounden, and led</a>
<a id='line_6321'>shamefully to his death. O Jesu, said Launcelot, what misadventure is</a>
<a id='line_6322'>befallen him that he is thus led toward his death? Forsooth, said</a>
<a id='line_6323'>Launcelot, it were shame to me to suffer this noble knight so to die an</a>
<a id='line_6324'>I might help him, therefore I will help him whatsomever come of it, or</a>
<a id='line_6325'>else I shall die for Sir Palomides’ sake. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6326'>mounted upon his horse, and gat his spear in his hand, and rode after</a>
<a id='line_6327'>the twelve knights that led Sir Palomides. Fair knights, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6328'>Launcelot, whither lead ye that knight? it beseemeth him full ill to</a>
<a id='line_6329'>ride bounden. Then these twelve knights suddenly turned their horses</a>
<a id='line_6330'>and said to Sir Launcelot: Sir knight, we counsel thee not to meddle</a>
<a id='line_6331'>with this knight, for he hath deserved death, and unto death he is</a>
<a id='line_6332'>judged. That me repenteth, said Launcelot, that I may not borrow him</a>
<a id='line_6333'>with fairness, for he is over good a knight to die such a shameful</a>
<a id='line_6334'>death. And therefore, fair knights, said Sir Launcelot, keep you as</a>
<a id='line_6335'>well as ye can, for I will rescue that knight or die for it.</a>
<a id='line_6336'></a>
<a id='line_6337'>Then they began to dress their spears, and Sir Launcelot smote the</a>
<a id='line_6338'>foremost down, horse and man, and so he served three more with one</a>
<a id='line_6339'>spear; and then that spear brast, and therewithal Sir Launcelot drew</a>
<a id='line_6340'>his sword, and then he smote on the right hand and on the left hand.</a>
<a id='line_6341'>Then within a while he left none of those twelve knights, but he had</a>
<a id='line_6342'>laid them to the earth, and the most part of them were sore wounded.</a>
<a id='line_6343'>And then Sir Launcelot took the best horse that he found, and loosed</a>
<a id='line_6344'>Sir Palomides and set him upon that horse; and so they returned again</a>
<a id='line_6345'>unto Joyous Gard, and then was Sir Palomides ware of Sir Tristram how</a>
<a id='line_6346'>he came riding. And when Sir Launcelot saw him he knew him well, but</a>
<a id='line_6347'>Sir Tristram knew him not because Sir Launcelot had on his shoulder a</a>
<a id='line_6348'>golden shield. So Sir Launcelot made him ready to joust with Sir</a>
<a id='line_6349'>Tristram, that Sir Tristram should not ween that he were Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6350'>Then Sir Palomides cried aloud to Sir Tristram: O my lord, I require</a>
<a id='line_6351'>you joust not with this knight, for this good knight hath saved me from</a>
<a id='line_6352'>my death. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he came a soft trotting</a>
<a id='line_6353'>pace toward them. And then Sir Palomides said: My lord, Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_6354'>much am I beholding unto you of your great goodness, that would proffer</a>
<a id='line_6355'>your noble body to rescue me undeserved, for I have greatly offended</a>
<a id='line_6356'>you. Notwithstanding, said Sir Palomides, here met we with this noble</a>
<a id='line_6357'>knight that worshipfully and manly rescued me from twelve knights, and</a>
<a id='line_6358'>smote them down all and wounded them sore.</a>
<a id='line_6359'></a>

<a id='line_6362'></a>
<a id='line_6363'>CHAPTER LXXXVI. How Sir Tristram and Launcelot, with Palomides, came to</a>
<a id='line_6364'>joyous Gard; and of Palomides and Sir Tristram.</a>
<a id='line_6365'></a>
<a id='line_6366'></a>
<a id='line_6367'>Fair knight, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Launcelot, of whence be ye? I</a>
<a id='line_6368'>am a knight errant, said Sir Launcelot, that rideth to seek many</a>
<a id='line_6369'>adventures. What is your name? said Sir Tristram. Sir, at this time I</a>
<a id='line_6370'>will not tell you. Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Tristram and to</a>
<a id='line_6371'>Palomides: Now either of you are met together I will depart from you.</a>
<a id='line_6372'>Not so, said Sir Tristram; I pray you of knighthood to ride with me</a>
<a id='line_6373'>unto my castle. Wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride with</a>
<a id='line_6374'>you, for I have many deeds to do in other places, that at this time I</a>
<a id='line_6375'>may not abide with you. Ah, mercy Jesu, said Sir Tristram, I require</a>
<a id='line_6376'>you as ye be a true knight to the order of knighthood, play you with me</a>
<a id='line_6377'>this night. Then Sir Tristram had a grant of Sir Launcelot: howbeit</a>
<a id='line_6378'>though he had not desired him he would have ridden with them, outher</a>
<a id='line_6379'>soon have come after them; for Sir Launcelot came for none other cause</a>
<a id='line_6380'>into that country but for to see Sir Tristram. And when they were come</a>
<a id='line_6381'>within Joyous Gard they alighted, and their horses were led into a</a>
<a id='line_6382'>stable; and then they unarmed them. And when Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_6383'>unhelmed, Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides knew him. Then Sir Tristram</a>
<a id='line_6384'>took Sir Launcelot in arms, and so did La Beale Isoud; and Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6385'>kneeled down upon his knees and thanked Sir Launcelot. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_6386'>Launcelot saw Sir Palomides kneel he lightly took him up and said thus:</a>
<a id='line_6387'>Wit thou well, Sir Palomides, I and any knight in this land, of worship</a>
<a id='line_6388'>ought of very right succour and rescue so noble a knight as ye are</a>
<a id='line_6389'>proved and renowned, throughout all this realm endlong and overthwart.</a>
<a id='line_6390'>And then was there joy among them, and the oftener that Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6391'>saw La Beale Isoud the heavier he waxed day by day.</a>
<a id='line_6392'></a>
<a id='line_6393'>Then Sir Launcelot within three or four days departed, and with him</a>
<a id='line_6394'>rode Sir Ector de Maris; and Dinadan and Sir Palomides were there left</a>
<a id='line_6395'>with Sir Tristram a two months and more. But ever Sir Palomides faded</a>
<a id='line_6396'>and mourned, that all men had marvel wherefore he faded so away. So</a>
<a id='line_6397'>upon a day, in the dawning, Sir Palomides went into the forest by</a>
<a id='line_6398'>himself alone; and there he found a well, and then he looked into the</a>
<a id='line_6399'>well, and in the water he saw his own visage, how he was disturbed and</a>
<a id='line_6400'>defaded, nothing like that he was. What may this mean? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6401'>Palomides, and thus he said to himself: Ah, Palomides, Palomides, why</a>
<a id='line_6402'>art thou defaded, thou that was wont to be called one of the fairest</a>
<a id='line_6403'>knights of the world? I will no more lead this life, for I love that I</a>
<a id='line_6404'>may never get nor recover. And therewithal he laid him down by the</a>
<a id='line_6405'>well. And then he began to make a rhyme of La Beale Isoud and him.</a>
<a id='line_6406'></a>
<a id='line_6407'>And in the meanwhile Sir Tristram was that same day ridden into the</a>
<a id='line_6408'>forest to chase the hart of greese; but Sir Tristram would not ride</a>
<a id='line_6409'>a-hunting never more unarmed, because of Sir Breuse Saunce Pité. And so</a>
<a id='line_6410'>as Sir Tristram rode into that forest up and down, he heard one sing</a>
<a id='line_6411'>marvellously loud, and that was Sir Palomides that lay by the well. And</a>
<a id='line_6412'>then Sir Tristram rode softly thither, for he deemed there was some</a>
<a id='line_6413'>knight errant that was at the well. And when Sir Tristram came nigh him</a>
<a id='line_6414'>he descended down from his horse and tied his horse fast till a tree,</a>
<a id='line_6415'>and then he came near him on foot; and anon he was ware where lay Sir</a>
<a id='line_6416'>Palomides by the well and sang loud and merrily; and ever the</a>
<a id='line_6417'>complaints were of that noble queen, La Beale Isoud, the which was</a>
<a id='line_6418'>marvellously and wonderfully well said, and full dolefully and</a>
<a id='line_6419'>piteously made. And all the whole song the noble knight, Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_6420'>heard from the beginning to the ending, the which grieved and troubled</a>
<a id='line_6421'>him sore.</a>
<a id='line_6422'></a>
<a id='line_6423'>But then at the last, when Sir Tristram had heard all Sir Palomides’</a>
<a id='line_6424'>complaints, he was wroth out of measure, and thought for to slay him</a>
<a id='line_6425'>thereas he lay. Then Sir Tristram remembered himself that Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6426'>was unarmed, and of the noble name that Sir Palomides had, and the</a>
<a id='line_6427'>noble name that himself had, and then he made a restraint of his anger;</a>
<a id='line_6428'>and so he went unto Sir Palomides a soft pace and said: Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_6429'>I have heard your complaint, and of thy treason that thou hast owed me</a>
<a id='line_6430'>so long, and wit thou well therefore thou shalt die; and if it were not</a>
<a id='line_6431'>for shame of knighthood thou shouldest not escape my hands, for now I</a>
<a id='line_6432'>know well thou hast awaited me with treason. Tell me, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6433'>Tristram, how thou wilt acquit thee? Sir, said Palomides, thus I will</a>
<a id='line_6434'>acquit me: as for Queen La Beale Isoud, ye shall wit well that I love</a>
<a id='line_6435'>her above all other ladies in this world; and well I wot it shall</a>
<a id='line_6436'>befall me as for her love as befell to the noble knight Sir Kehydius,</a>
<a id='line_6437'>that died for the love of La Beale Isoud. And now, Sir Tristram, I will</a>
<a id='line_6438'>that ye wit that I have loved La Beale Isoud many a day, and she hath</a>
<a id='line_6439'>been the causer of my worship, and else I had been the most simplest</a>
<a id='line_6440'>knight in the world. For by her, and because of her, I have won the</a>
<a id='line_6441'>worship that I have; for when I remembered me of La Beale Isoud I won</a>
<a id='line_6442'>the worship wheresomever I came for the most part; and yet had I never</a>
<a id='line_6443'>reward nor bounté of her the days of my life, and yet have I been her</a>
<a id='line_6444'>knight guerdonless. And therefore, Sir Tristram, as for any death I</a>
<a id='line_6445'>dread not, for I had as lief die as to live. And if I were armed as</a>
<a id='line_6446'>thou art, I should lightly do battle with thee. Well have ye uttered</a>
<a id='line_6447'>your treason, said Tristram. I have done to you no treason, said</a>
<a id='line_6448'>Palomides, for love is free for all men, and though I have loved your</a>
<a id='line_6449'>lady, she is my lady as well as yours; howbeit I have wrong if any</a>
<a id='line_6450'>wrong be, for ye rejoice her, and have your desire of her, and so had I</a>
<a id='line_6451'>never nor never am like to have, and yet shall I love her to the</a>
<a id='line_6452'>uttermost days of my life as well as ye.</a>
<a id='line_6453'></a>

<a id='line_6457'>CHAPTER LXXXVII. How there was a day set between Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6458'>Palomides for to fight, and how Sir Tristram was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_6459'></a>
<a id='line_6460'></a>
<a id='line_6461'>Then said Sir Tristram: I will fight with you to the uttermost. I</a>
<a id='line_6462'>grant, said Palomides, for in a better quarrel keep I never to fight,</a>
<a id='line_6463'>for an I die of your hands, of a better knight’s hands may I not be</a>
<a id='line_6464'>slain. And sithen I understand that I shall never rejoice La Beale</a>
<a id='line_6465'>Isoud, I have as good will to die as to live. Then set ye a day, said</a>
<a id='line_6466'>Sir Tristram, that we shall do battle. This day fifteen days, said</a>
<a id='line_6467'>Palomides, will I meet with you hereby, in the meadow under Joyous</a>
<a id='line_6468'>Gard. Fie for shame, said Sir Tristram, will ye set so long day? let us</a>
<a id='line_6469'>fight to-morn. Not so, said Palomides, for I am meagre, and have been</a>
<a id='line_6470'>long sick for the love of La Beale Isoud, and therefore I will repose</a>
<a id='line_6471'>me till I have my strength again. So then Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6472'>Palomides promised faith fully to meet at the well that day fifteen</a>
<a id='line_6473'>days. I am remembered, said Sir Tristram to Palomides, that ye brake me</a>
<a id='line_6474'>once a promise when that I rescued you from Breuse Saunce Pité and nine</a>
<a id='line_6475'>knights; and then ye promised me to meet me at the peron and the grave</a>
<a id='line_6476'>beside Camelot, whereas at that time ye failed of your promise. Wit you</a>
<a id='line_6477'>well, said Palomides unto Sir Tristram, I was at that day in prison, so</a>
<a id='line_6478'>that I might not hold my promise. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, an</a>
<a id='line_6479'>ye had holden your promise this work had not been here now at this</a>
<a id='line_6480'>time.</a>
<a id='line_6481'></a>
<a id='line_6482'>Right so departed Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides. And so Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_6483'>took his horse and his harness, and he rode unto King Arthur’s court;</a>
<a id='line_6484'>and there Sir Palomides gat him four knights and four</a>
<a id='line_6485'>sergeants-of-arms, and so he returned againward unto Joyous Gard. And</a>
<a id='line_6486'>in the meanwhile Sir Tristram chased and hunted at all manner of</a>
<a id='line_6487'>venery; and about three days afore the battle should be, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_6488'>Tristram chased an hart, there was an archer shot at the hart, and by</a>
<a id='line_6489'>misfortune he smote Sir Tristram in the thick of the thigh, and the</a>
<a id='line_6490'>arrow slew Sir Tristram’s horse and hurt him. When Sir Tristram was so</a>
<a id='line_6491'>hurt he was passing heavy, and wit ye well he bled sore; and then he</a>
<a id='line_6492'>took another horse, and rode unto Joyous Gard with great heaviness,</a>
<a id='line_6493'>more for the promise that he had made with Sir Palomides, as to do</a>
<a id='line_6494'>battle with him within three days after, than for any hurt of his</a>
<a id='line_6495'>thigh. Wherefore there was neither man nor woman that could cheer him</a>
<a id='line_6496'>with anything that they could make to him, neither Queen La Beale</a>
<a id='line_6497'>Isoud; for ever he deemed that Sir Palomides had smitten him so that he</a>
<a id='line_6498'>should not be able to do battle with him at the day set.</a>
<a id='line_6499'></a>

<a id='line_6503'>CHAPTER LXXXVIII. How Sir Palomides kept his day to have foughten, but</a>
<a id='line_6504'>Sir Tristram might not come; and other things.</a>
<a id='line_6505'></a>
<a id='line_6506'></a>
<a id='line_6507'>But in no wise there was no knight about Sir Tristram that would</a>
<a id='line_6508'>believe that ever Sir Palomides would hurt Sir Tristram, neither by his</a>
<a id='line_6509'>own hands nor by none other consenting. Then when the fifteenth day was</a>
<a id='line_6510'>come, Sir Palomides came to the well with four knights with him of</a>
<a id='line_6511'>Arthur’s court, and three sergeants-of-arms. And for this intent Sir</a>
<a id='line_6512'>Palomides brought the knights with him and the sergeants-of-arms, for</a>
<a id='line_6513'>they should bear record of the battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_6514'>Palomides. And the one sergeant brought in his helm, the other his</a>
<a id='line_6515'>spear, the third his sword. So thus Palomides came into the field, and</a>
<a id='line_6516'>there he abode nigh two hours; and then he sent a squire unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_6517'>Tristram, and desired him to come into the field to hold his promise.</a>
<a id='line_6518'></a>
<a id='line_6519'>When the squire was come to Joyous Gard, anon as Sir Tristram heard of</a>
<a id='line_6520'>his coming he let command that the squire should come to his presence</a>
<a id='line_6521'>thereas he lay in his bed. My lord Sir Tristram, said Palomides’</a>
<a id='line_6522'>squire, wit you well my lord, Palomides, abideth you in the field, and</a>
<a id='line_6523'>he would wit whether ye would do battle or not. Ah, my fair brother,</a>
<a id='line_6524'>said Sir Tristram, wit thou well that I am right heavy for these</a>
<a id='line_6525'>tidings; therefore tell Sir Palomides an I were well at ease I would</a>
<a id='line_6526'>not lie here, nor he should have no need to send for me an I might</a>
<a id='line_6527'>either ride or go; and for thou shalt say that I am no liar—Sir</a>
<a id='line_6528'>Tristram showed him his thigh that the wound was six inches deep. And</a>
<a id='line_6529'>now thou hast seen my hurt, tell thy lord that this is no feigned</a>
<a id='line_6530'>matter, and tell him that I had liefer than all the gold of King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_6531'>that I were whole; and tell Palomides as soon as I am whole I shall</a>
<a id='line_6532'>seek him endlong and overthwart, and that I promise you as I am true</a>
<a id='line_6533'>knight; and if ever I may meet with him, he shall have battle of me his</a>
<a id='line_6534'>fill. And with this the squire departed; and when Palomides wist that</a>
<a id='line_6535'>Tristram was hurt he was glad and said: Now I am sure I shall have no</a>
<a id='line_6536'>shame, for I wot well I should have had hard handling of him, and by</a>
<a id='line_6537'>likely I must needs have had the worse, for he is the hardest knight in</a>
<a id='line_6538'>battle that now is living except Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6539'></a>
<a id='line_6540'>And then departed Sir Palomides whereas fortune led him, and within a</a>
<a id='line_6541'>month Sir Tristram was whole of his hurt. And then he took his horse,</a>
<a id='line_6542'>and rode from country to country, and all strange adventures he</a>
<a id='line_6543'>achieved wheresomever he rode; and always he enquired for Sir</a>
<a id='line_6544'>Palomides, but of all that quarter of summer Sir Tristram could never</a>
<a id='line_6545'>meet with Sir Palomides. But thus as Sir Tristram sought and enquired</a>
<a id='line_6546'>after Sir Palomides Sir Tristram achieved many great battles,</a>
<a id='line_6547'>wherethrough all the noise fell to Sir Tristram, and it ceased of Sir</a>
<a id='line_6548'>Launcelot; and therefore Sir Launcelot’s brethren and his kinsmen would</a>
<a id='line_6549'>have slain Sir Tristram because of his fame. But when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6550'>wist how his kinsmen were set, he said to them openly: Wit you well,</a>
<a id='line_6551'>that an the envy of you all be so hardy to wait upon my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6552'>Tristram, with any hurt, shame, or villainy, as I am true knight I</a>
<a id='line_6553'>shall slay the best of you with mine own hands. Alas, fie for shame,</a>
<a id='line_6554'>should ye for his noble deeds await upon him to slay him. Jesu defend,</a>
<a id='line_6555'>said Launcelot, that ever any noble knight as Sir Tristram is should be</a>
<a id='line_6556'>destroyed with treason. Of this noise and fame sprang into Cornwall,</a>
<a id='line_6557'>and among them of Liones, whereof they were passing glad, and made</a>
<a id='line_6558'>great joy. And then they of Liones sent letters unto Sir Tristram of</a>
<a id='line_6559'>recommendation, and many great gifts to maintain Sir Tristram’s estate;</a>
<a id='line_6560'>and ever, between, Sir Tristram resorted unto Joyous Gard whereas La</a>
<a id='line_6561'>Beale Isoud was, that loved him as her life.</a>

<a id='line_6576'></a>
<a id='line_6577'></a>
<a id='line_6578'>Now leave we Sir Tristram de Liones, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6579'>Lake, and of Sir Galahad, Sir Launcelot’s son, how he was gotten, and</a>
<a id='line_6580'>in what manner, as the book of French rehearseth. Afore the time that</a>
<a id='line_6581'>Sir Galahad was gotten or born, there came in an hermit unto King</a>
<a id='line_6582'>Arthur upon Whitsunday, as the knights sat at the Table Round. And when</a>
<a id='line_6583'>the hermit saw the Siege Perilous, he asked the king and all the</a>
<a id='line_6584'>knights why that siege was void. Sir Arthur and all the knights</a>
<a id='line_6585'>answered: There shall never none sit in that siege but one, but if he</a>
<a id='line_6586'>be destroyed. Then said the hermit: Wot ye what is he? Nay, said Arthur</a>
<a id='line_6587'>and all the knights, we wot not who is he that shall sit therein. Then</a>
<a id='line_6588'>wot I, said the hermit, for he that shall sit there is unborn and</a>
<a id='line_6589'>ungotten, and this same year he shall be gotten that shall sit there in</a>
<a id='line_6590'>that Siege Perilous, and he shall win the Sangreal. When this hermit</a>
<a id='line_6591'>had made this mention he departed from the court of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_6592'></a>
<a id='line_6593'>And then after this feast Sir Launcelot rode on his adventure, till on</a>
<a id='line_6594'>a time by adventure he passed over the pont of Corbin; and there he saw</a>
<a id='line_6595'>the fairest tower that ever he saw, and there-under was a fair town</a>
<a id='line_6596'>full of people; and all the people, men and women, cried at once:</a>
<a id='line_6597'>Welcome, Sir Launcelot du Lake, the flower of all knighthood, for by</a>
<a id='line_6598'>thee all we shall be holpen out of danger. What mean ye, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6599'>Launcelot, that ye cry so upon me? Ah, fair knight, said they all, here</a>
<a id='line_6600'>is within this tower a dolorous lady that hath been there in pains many</a>
<a id='line_6601'>winters and days, for ever she boileth in scalding water; and but late,</a>
<a id='line_6602'>said all the people, Sir Gawaine was here and he might not help her,</a>
<a id='line_6603'>and so he left her in pain. So may I, said Sir Launcelot, leave her in</a>
<a id='line_6604'>pain as well as Sir Gawaine did. Nay, said the people, we know well</a>
<a id='line_6605'>that it is Sir Launcelot that shall deliver her. Well, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6606'>then shew me what I shall do.</a>
<a id='line_6607'></a>
<a id='line_6608'>Then they brought Sir Launcelot into the tower; and when he came to the</a>
<a id='line_6609'>chamber thereas this lady was, the doors of iron unlocked and unbolted.</a>
<a id='line_6610'>And so Sir Launcelot went into the chamber that was as hot as any stew.</a>
<a id='line_6611'>And there Sir Launcelot took the fairest lady by the hand that ever he</a>
<a id='line_6612'>saw, and she was naked as a needle; and by enchantment Queen Morgan le</a>
<a id='line_6613'>Fay and the Queen of Northgalis had put her there in that pains,</a>
<a id='line_6614'>because she was called the fairest lady of that country; and there she</a>
<a id='line_6615'>had been five years, and never might she be delivered out of her great</a>
<a id='line_6616'>pains unto the time the best knight of the world had taken her by the</a>
<a id='line_6617'>hand. Then the people brought her clothes. And when she was arrayed,</a>
<a id='line_6618'>Sir Launcelot thought she was the fairest lady of the world, but if it</a>
<a id='line_6619'>were Queen Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_6620'></a>
<a id='line_6621'>Then this lady said to Sir Launcelot: Sir, if it please you will ye go</a>
<a id='line_6622'>with me hereby into a chapel that we may give loving and thanking unto</a>
<a id='line_6623'>God? Madam, said Sir Launcelot, come on with me, I will go with you. So</a>
<a id='line_6624'>when they came there and gave thankings to God all the people, both</a>
<a id='line_6625'>learned and lewd, gave thankings unto God and him, and said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_6626'>knight, since ye have delivered this lady, ye shall deliver us from a</a>
<a id='line_6627'>serpent there is here in a tomb. Then Sir Launcelot took his shield and</a>
<a id='line_6628'>said: Bring me thither, and what I may do unto the pleasure of God and</a>
<a id='line_6629'>you I will do. So when Sir Launcelot came thither he saw written upon</a>
<a id='line_6630'>the tomb letters of gold that said thus: Here shall come a leopard of</a>
<a id='line_6631'>king’s blood, and he shall slay this serpent, and this leopard shall</a>
<a id='line_6632'>engender a lion in this foreign country, the which lion shall pass all</a>
<a id='line_6633'>other knights. So then Sir Launcelot lift up the tomb, and there came</a>
<a id='line_6634'>out an horrible and a fiendly dragon, spitting fire out of his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_6635'>Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and fought with the dragon long, and</a>
<a id='line_6636'>at the last with great pain Sir Launcelot slew that dragon. Therewithal</a>
<a id='line_6637'>came King Pelles, the good and noble knight, and saluted Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6638'>and he him again. Fair knight, said the king, what is your name? I</a>
<a id='line_6639'>require you of your knighthood tell me!</a>

<a id='line_6645'>of Elaine, King Pelles’ daughter.</a>
<a id='line_6646'></a>
<a id='line_6647'></a>
<a id='line_6648'>Sir, said Launcelot, wit you well my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. And</a>
<a id='line_6649'>my name is, said the king, Pelles, king of the foreign country, and</a>
<a id='line_6650'>cousin nigh unto Joseph of Armathie. And then either of them made much</a>
<a id='line_6651'>of other, and so they went into the castle to take their repast. And</a>
<a id='line_6652'>anon there came in a dove at a window, and in her mouth there seemed a</a>
<a id='line_6653'>little censer of gold. And herewithal there was such a savour as all</a>
<a id='line_6654'>the spicery of the world had been there. And forthwithal there was upon</a>
<a id='line_6655'>the table all manner of meats and drinks that they could think upon. So</a>
<a id='line_6656'>came in a damosel passing fair and young, and she bare a vessel of gold</a>
<a id='line_6657'>betwixt her hands; and thereto the king kneeled devoutly, and said his</a>
<a id='line_6658'>prayers, and so did all that were there. O Jesu, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6659'>what may this mean? This is, said the king, the richest thing that any</a>
<a id='line_6660'>man hath living. And when this thing goeth about, the Round Table shall</a>
<a id='line_6661'>be broken; and wit thou well, said the king, this is the holy Sangreal</a>
<a id='line_6662'>that ye have here seen. So the king and Sir Launcelot led their life</a>
<a id='line_6663'>the most part of that day. And fain would King Pelles have found the</a>
<a id='line_6664'>mean to have had Sir Launcelot to have lain by his daughter, fair</a>
<a id='line_6665'>Elaine. And for this intent: the king knew well that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6666'>should get a child upon his daughter, the which should be named Sir</a>
<a id='line_6667'>Galahad the good knight, by whom all the foreign country should be</a>
<a id='line_6668'>brought out of danger, and by him the Holy Greal should be achieved.</a>
<a id='line_6669'></a>
<a id='line_6670'>Then came forth a lady that hight Dame Brisen, and she said unto the</a>
<a id='line_6671'>king: Sir, wit ye well Sir Launcelot loveth no lady in the world but</a>
<a id='line_6672'>all only Queen Guenever; and therefore work ye by counsel, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_6673'>make him to lie with your daughter, and he shall not wit but that he</a>
<a id='line_6674'>lieth with Queen Guenever. O fair lady, Dame Brisen, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_6675'>hope ye to bring this about? Sir, said she, upon pain of my life let me</a>
<a id='line_6676'>deal; for this Brisen was one of the greatest enchantresses that was at</a>
<a id='line_6677'>that time in the world living. Then anon by Dame Brisen’s wit she made</a>
<a id='line_6678'>one to come to Sir Launcelot that he knew well. And this man brought</a>
<a id='line_6679'>him a ring from Queen Guenever like as it had come from her, and such</a>
<a id='line_6680'>one as she was wont for the most part to wear; and when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6681'>saw that token wit ye well he was never so fain. Where is my lady? said</a>
<a id='line_6682'>Sir Launcelot. In the Castle of Case, said the messenger, but five mile</a>
<a id='line_6683'>hence. Then Sir Launcelot thought to be there the same might. And then</a>
<a id='line_6684'>this Brisen by the commandment of King Pelles let send Elaine to this</a>
<a id='line_6685'>castle with twenty-five knights unto the Castle of Case. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6686'>Launcelot against night rode unto that castle, and there anon he was</a>
<a id='line_6687'>received worshipfully with such people, to his seeming, as were about</a>
<a id='line_6688'>Queen Guenever secret.</a>
<a id='line_6689'></a>
<a id='line_6690'>So when Sir Launcelot was alighted, he asked where the queen was. So</a>
<a id='line_6691'>Dame Brisen said she was in her bed; and then the people were avoided,</a>
<a id='line_6692'>and Sir Launcelot was led unto his chamber. And then Dame Brisen</a>
<a id='line_6693'>brought Sir Launcelot a cup full of wine; and anon as he had drunken</a>
<a id='line_6694'>that wine he was so assotted and mad that he might make no delay, but</a>
<a id='line_6695'>withouten any let he went to bed; and he weened that maiden Elaine had</a>
<a id='line_6696'>been Queen Guenever. Wit you well that Sir Launcelot was glad, and so</a>
<a id='line_6697'>was that lady Elaine that she had gotten Sir Launcelot in her arms. For</a>
<a id='line_6698'>well she knew that same night should be gotten upon her Galahad that</a>
<a id='line_6699'>should prove the best knight of the world; and so they lay together</a>
<a id='line_6700'>until underne of the morn; and all the windows and holes of that</a>
<a id='line_6701'>chamber were stopped that no manner of day might be seen. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_6702'>Launcelot remembered him, and he arose up and went to the window.</a>
<a id='line_6703'></a>
<a id='line_6704'></a>
<a id='line_6705'></a>
<a id='line_6706'></a>
<a id='line_6707'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot was displeased when he knew that he had</a>
<a id='line_6708'>lain by Dame Elaine, and how she was delivered of Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_6709'></a>
<a id='line_6710'></a>
<a id='line_6711'>And anon as he had unshut the window the enchantment was gone; then he</a>
<a id='line_6712'>knew himself that he had done amiss. Alas, he said, that I have lived</a>
<a id='line_6713'>so long; now I am shamed. So then he gat his sword in his hand and</a>
<a id='line_6714'>said: Thou traitress, what art thou that I have lain by all this night?</a>
<a id='line_6715'>thou shalt die right here of my hands. Then this fair lady Elaine</a>
<a id='line_6716'>skipped out of her bed all naked, and kneeled down afore Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6717'>and said: Fair courteous knight, come of king’s blood, I require you</a>
<a id='line_6718'>have mercy upon me, and as thou art renowned the most noble knight of</a>
<a id='line_6719'>the world, slay me not, for I have in my womb him by thee that shall be</a>
<a id='line_6720'>the most noblest knight of the world. Ah, false traitress, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6721'>Launcelot, why hast thou betrayed me? anon tell me what thou art. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_6722'>she said, I am Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles. Well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6723'>Launcelot, I will forgive you this deed; and therewith he took her up</a>
<a id='line_6724'>in his arms, and kissed her, for she was as fair a lady, and thereto</a>
<a id='line_6725'>lusty and young, and as wise, as any was that time living. So God me</a>
<a id='line_6726'>help, said Sir Launcelot, I may not wite this to you; but her that made</a>
<a id='line_6727'>this enchantment upon me as between you and me, an I may find her, that</a>
<a id='line_6728'>same Lady Brisen, she shall lose her head for witchcrafts, for there</a>
<a id='line_6729'>was never knight deceived so as I am this night. And so Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_6730'>arrayed him, and armed him, and took his leave mildly at that lady</a>
<a id='line_6731'>young Elaine, and so he departed. Then she said: My lord Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_6732'>I beseech you see me as soon as ye may, for I have obeyed me unto the</a>
<a id='line_6733'>prophecy that my father told me. And by his commandment to fulfil this</a>
<a id='line_6734'>prophecy I have given the greatest riches and the fairest flower that</a>
<a id='line_6735'>ever I had, and that is my maidenhood that I shall never have again;</a>
<a id='line_6736'>and therefore, gentle knight, owe me your good will.</a>
<a id='line_6737'></a>
<a id='line_6738'>And so Sir Launcelot arrayed him and was armed, and took his leave</a>
<a id='line_6739'>mildly at that young lady Elaine; and so he departed, and rode till he</a>
<a id='line_6740'>came to the Castle of Corbin, where her father was. And as fast as her</a>
<a id='line_6741'>time came she was delivered of a fair child, and they christened him</a>
<a id='line_6742'>Galahad; and wit ye well that child was well kept and well nourished,</a>
<a id='line_6743'>and he was named Galahad because Sir Launcelot was so named at the</a>
<a id='line_6744'>fountain stone; and after that the Lady of the Lake confirmed him Sir</a>
<a id='line_6745'>Launcelot du Lake.</a>
<a id='line_6746'></a>
<a id='line_6747'>Then after this lady was delivered and churched, there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_6748'>unto her, his name was Sir Bromel la Pleche, the which was a great</a>
<a id='line_6749'>lord; and he had loved that lady long, and he evermore desired her to</a>
<a id='line_6750'>wed her; and so by no mean she could put him off, till on a day she</a>
<a id='line_6751'>said to Sir Bromel: Wit thou well, sir knight, I will not love you, for</a>
<a id='line_6752'>my love is set upon the best knight of the world. Who is he? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6753'>Bromel. Sir, she said, it is Sir Launcelot du Lake that I love and none</a>
<a id='line_6754'>other, and therefore woo me no longer. Ye say well, said Sir Bromel,</a>
<a id='line_6755'>and sithen ye have told me so much, ye shall have but little joy of Sir</a>
<a id='line_6756'>Launcelot, for I shall slay him wheresomever I meet him. Sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_6757'>Lady Elaine, do to him no treason. Wit ye well, my lady, said Bromel,</a>
<a id='line_6758'>and I promise you this twelvemonth I shall keep the pont of Corbin for</a>
<a id='line_6759'>Sir Launcelot’s sake, that he shall neither come nor go unto you, but I</a>
<a id='line_6760'>shall meet with him.</a>
<a id='line_6761'></a>
<a id='line_6762'></a>
<a id='line_6763'></a>
<a id='line_6764'></a>
<a id='line_6765'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Bors came to Dame Elaine and saw Galahad, and how</a>
<a id='line_6766'>he was fed with the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_6767'></a>
<a id='line_6768'></a>
<a id='line_6769'>Then as it fell by fortune and adventure, Sir Bors de Ganis, that was</a>
<a id='line_6770'>nephew unto Sir Launcelot, came over that bridge; and there Sir Bromel</a>
<a id='line_6771'>and Sir Bors jousted, and Sir Bors smote Sir Bromel such a buffet that</a>
<a id='line_6772'>he bare him over his horse’s croup. And then Sir Bromel, as an hardy</a>
<a id='line_6773'>knight, pulled out his sword, and dressed his shield to do battle with</a>
<a id='line_6774'>Sir Bors. And then Sir Bors alighted and avoided his horse, and there</a>
<a id='line_6775'>they dashed together many sad strokes; and long thus they fought, till</a>
<a id='line_6776'>at the last Sir Bromel was laid to the earth, and there Sir Bors began</a>
<a id='line_6777'>to unlace his helm to slay him. Then Sir Bromel cried Sir Bors mercy,</a>
<a id='line_6778'>and yielded him. Upon this covenant thou shalt have thy life, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6779'>Bors, so thou go unto Sir Launcelot upon Whitsunday that next cometh,</a>
<a id='line_6780'>and yield thee unto him as knight recreant. I will do it, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_6781'>Bromel, and that he sware upon the cross of the sword. And so he let</a>
<a id='line_6782'>him depart, and Sir Bors rode unto King Pelles, that was within Corbin.</a>
<a id='line_6783'></a>
<a id='line_6784'>And when the king and Elaine his daughter wist that Sir Bors was nephew</a>
<a id='line_6785'>unto Sir Launcelot, they made him great cheer. Then said Dame Elaine:</a>
<a id='line_6786'>We marvel where Sir Launcelot is, for he came never here but once.</a>
<a id='line_6787'>Marvel not, said Sir Bors, for this half year he hath been in prison</a>
<a id='line_6788'>with Queen Morgan le Fay, King Arthur’s sister. Alas, said Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_6789'>that me repenteth. And ever Sir Bors beheld that child in her arms, and</a>
<a id='line_6790'>ever him seemed it was passing like Sir Launcelot. Truly, said Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_6791'>wit ye well this child he gat upon me. Then Sir Bors wept for joy, and</a>
<a id='line_6792'>he prayed to God it might prove as good a knight as his father was. And</a>
<a id='line_6793'>so came in a white dove, and she bare a little censer of gold in her</a>
<a id='line_6794'>mouth, and there was all manner of meats and drinks; and a maiden bare</a>
<a id='line_6795'>that Sangreal, and she said openly: Wit you well, Sir Bors, that this</a>
<a id='line_6796'>child is Galahad, that shall sit in the Siege Perilous, and achieve the</a>
<a id='line_6797'>Sangreal, and he shall be much better than ever was Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_6798'>Lake, that is his own father. And then they kneeled down and made their</a>
<a id='line_6799'>devotions, and there was such a savour as all the spicery in the world</a>
<a id='line_6800'>had been there. And when the dove took her flight, the maiden vanished</a>
<a id='line_6801'>with the Sangreal as she came.</a>
<a id='line_6802'></a>
<a id='line_6803'>Sir, said Sir Bors unto King Pelles, this castle may be named the</a>
<a id='line_6804'>Castle Adventurous, for here be many strange adventures. That is sooth,</a>
<a id='line_6805'>said the king, for well may this place be called the adventures place,</a>
<a id='line_6806'>for there come but few knights here that go away with any worship; be</a>
<a id='line_6807'>he never so strong, here he may be proved; and but late Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_6808'>the good knight, gat but little worship here. For I let you wit, said</a>
<a id='line_6809'>King Pelles, here shall no knight win no worship but if he be of</a>
<a id='line_6810'>worship himself and of good living, and that loveth God and dreadeth</a>
<a id='line_6811'>God, and else he getteth no worship here, be he never so hardy. That is</a>
<a id='line_6812'>wonderful thing, said Sir Bors. What ye mean in this country I wot not,</a>
<a id='line_6813'>for ye have many strange adventures, and therefore I will lie in this</a>
<a id='line_6814'>castle this night. Ye shall not do so, said King Pelles, by my counsel,</a>
<a id='line_6815'>for it is hard an ye escape without a shame. I shall take the adventure</a>
<a id='line_6816'>that will befall me, said Sir Bors. Then I counsel you, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_6817'>to be confessed clean. As for that, said Sir Bors, I will be shriven</a>
<a id='line_6818'>with a good will. So Sir Bors was confessed, and for all women Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_6819'>was a virgin, save for one, that was the daughter of King Brangoris,</a>
<a id='line_6820'>and on her he gat a child that hight Elaine, and save for her Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_6821'>was a clean maiden.</a>
<a id='line_6822'></a>
<a id='line_6823'>And so Sir Bors was led unto bed in a fair large chamber, and many</a>
<a id='line_6824'>doors were shut about the chamber. When Sir Bors espied all those</a>
<a id='line_6825'>doors, he avoided all the people, for he might have nobody with him;</a>
<a id='line_6826'>but in no wise Sir Bors would unarm him, but so he laid him down upon</a>
<a id='line_6827'>the bed. And right so he saw come in a light, that he might well see a</a>
<a id='line_6828'>spear great and long that came straight upon him pointling, and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6829'>Bors seemed that the head of the spear brent like a taper. And anon, or</a>
<a id='line_6830'>Sir Bors wist, the spear head smote him into the shoulder an</a>
<a id='line_6831'>hand-breadth in deepness, and that wound grieved Sir Bors passing sore.</a>
<a id='line_6832'>And then he laid him down again for pain; and anon therewithal there</a>
<a id='line_6833'>came a knight armed with his shield on his shoulder and his sword in</a>
<a id='line_6834'>his hand, and he bade Sir Bors: Arise, sir knight, and fight with me. I</a>
<a id='line_6835'>am sore hurt, he said, but yet I shall not fail thee. And then Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_6836'>started up and dressed his shield; and then they lashed together</a>
<a id='line_6837'>mightily a great while; and at the last Sir Bors bare him backward</a>
<a id='line_6838'>until that he came unto a chamber door, and there that knight yede into</a>
<a id='line_6839'>that chamber and rested him a great while. And when he had reposed him</a>
<a id='line_6840'>he came out freshly again, and began new battle with Sir Bors mightily</a>
<a id='line_6841'>and strongly.</a>
<a id='line_6842'></a>

<a id='line_6846'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Bors made Sir Pedivere to yield him, and of</a>
<a id='line_6847'>marvellous adventures that he had, and how he achieved them.</a>
<a id='line_6848'></a>
<a id='line_6849'></a>
<a id='line_6850'>Then Sir Bors thought he should no more go into that chamber to rest</a>
<a id='line_6851'>him, and so Sir Bors dressed him betwixt the knight and that chamber</a>
<a id='line_6852'>door, and there Sir Bors smote him down, and then that knight yielded</a>
<a id='line_6853'>him. What is your name? said Sir Bors. Sir, said he, my name is</a>
<a id='line_6854'>Pedivere of the Straight Marches. So Sir Bors made him to swear at</a>
<a id='line_6855'>Whitsunday next coming to be at the court of King Arthur, and yield him</a>
<a id='line_6856'>there as a prisoner as an overcome knight by the hands of Sir Bors. So</a>
<a id='line_6857'>thus departed Sir Pedivere of the Straight Marches. And then Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_6858'>laid him down to rest, and then he heard and felt much noise in that</a>
<a id='line_6859'>chamber; and then Sir Bors espied that there came in, he wist not</a>
<a id='line_6860'>whether at the doors nor windows, shot of arrows and of quarrels so</a>
<a id='line_6861'>thick that he marvelled, and many fell upon him and hurt him in the</a>
<a id='line_6862'>bare places.</a>
<a id='line_6863'></a>
<a id='line_6864'>And then Sir Bors was ware where came in an hideous lion; so Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_6865'>dressed him unto the lion, and anon the lion bereft him his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_6866'>with his sword Sir Bors smote off the lion’s head. Right so Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_6867'>forthwithal saw a dragon in the court passing horrible, and there</a>
<a id='line_6868'>seemed letters of gold written in his forehead; and Sir Bors thought</a>
<a id='line_6869'>that the letters made a signification of King Arthur. Right so there</a>
<a id='line_6870'>came an horrible leopard and an old, and there they fought long, and</a>
<a id='line_6871'>did great battle together. And at the last the dragon spit out of his</a>
<a id='line_6872'>mouth as it had been an hundred dragons; and lightly all the small</a>
<a id='line_6873'>dragons slew the old dragon and tare him all to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_6874'></a>
<a id='line_6875'>Anon withal there came an old man into the hall, and he sat him down in</a>
<a id='line_6876'>a fair chair, and there seemed to be two adders about his neck; and</a>
<a id='line_6877'>then the old man had an harp, and there he sang an old song how Joseph</a>
<a id='line_6878'>of Armathie came into this land. Then when he had sung, the old man</a>
<a id='line_6879'>bade Sir Bors go from thence. For here shall ye have no more</a>
<a id='line_6880'>adventures; and full worshipfully have ye done, and better shall ye do</a>
<a id='line_6881'>hereafter. And then Sir Bors seemed that there came the whitest dove</a>
<a id='line_6882'>with a little golden censer in her mouth. And anon therewithal the</a>
<a id='line_6883'>tempest ceased and passed, that afore was marvellous to hear. So was</a>
<a id='line_6884'>all that court full of good savours. Then Sir Bors saw four children</a>
<a id='line_6885'>bearing four fair tapers, and an old man in the midst of the children</a>
<a id='line_6886'>with a censer in his own hand, and a spear in his other hand, and that</a>
<a id='line_6887'>spear was called the Spear of Vengeance.</a>
<a id='line_6888'></a>
<a id='line_6889'></a>
<a id='line_6890'></a>
<a id='line_6891'></a>
<a id='line_6892'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Bors departed; and how Sir Launcelot was rebuked of</a>
<a id='line_6893'>Queen Guenever, and of his excuse.</a>
<a id='line_6894'></a>
<a id='line_6895'></a>
<a id='line_6896'>Now, said that old man to Sir Bors, go ye to your cousin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_6897'>Launcelot, and tell him of this adventure the which had been most</a>
<a id='line_6898'>convenient for him of all earthly knights; but sin is so foul in him he</a>
<a id='line_6899'>may not achieve such holy deeds, for had not been his sin he had passed</a>
<a id='line_6900'>all the knights that ever were in his days; and tell thou Sir</a>
<a id='line_6901'>Launcelot, of all worldly adventures he passeth in manhood and prowess</a>
<a id='line_6902'>all other, but in this spiritual matters he shall have many his better.</a>
<a id='line_6903'>And then Sir Bors saw four gentlewomen come by him, purely beseen: and</a>
<a id='line_6904'>he saw where that they entered into a chamber where was great light as</a>
<a id='line_6905'>it were a summer light; and the women kneeled down afore an altar of</a>
<a id='line_6906'>silver with four pillars, and as it had been a bishop kneeled down</a>
<a id='line_6907'>afore that table of silver. And as Sir Bors looked over his head he saw</a>
<a id='line_6908'>a sword like silver, naked, hoving over his head, and the clearness</a>
<a id='line_6909'>thereof smote so in his eyes that as at that time Sir Bors was blind;</a>
<a id='line_6910'>and there he heard a voice that said: Go hence, thou Sir Bors, for as</a>
<a id='line_6911'>yet thou art not worthy for to be in this place. And then he yede</a>
<a id='line_6912'>backward to his bed till on the morn. And on the morn King Pelles made</a>
<a id='line_6913'>great joy of Sir Bors; and then he departed and rode to Camelot, and</a>
<a id='line_6914'>there he found Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told him of the adventures</a>
<a id='line_6915'>that he had seen with King Pelles at Corbin.</a>
<a id='line_6916'></a>
<a id='line_6917'>So the noise sprang in Arthur’s court that Launcelot had gotten a child</a>
<a id='line_6918'>upon Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, wherefore Queen Guenever was</a>
<a id='line_6919'>wroth, and gave many rebukes to Sir Launcelot, and called him false</a>
<a id='line_6920'>knight. And then Sir Launcelot told the queen all, and how he was made</a>
<a id='line_6921'>to lie by her by enchantment in likeness of the queen. So the queen</a>
<a id='line_6922'>held Sir Launcelot excused. And as the book saith, King Arthur had been</a>
<a id='line_6923'>in France, and had made war upon the mighty King Claudas, and had won</a>
<a id='line_6924'>much of his lands. And when the king was come again he let cry a great</a>
<a id='line_6925'>feast, that all lords and ladies of all England should be there, but if</a>
<a id='line_6926'>it were such as were rebellious against him.</a>
<a id='line_6927'></a>
<a id='line_6928'></a>

<a id='line_6930'></a>
<a id='line_6931'>CHAPTER VII. How Dame Elaine, Galahad’s mother, came in great estate</a>
<a id='line_6932'>unto Camelot, and how Sir Launcelot behaved him there.</a>
<a id='line_6933'></a>
<a id='line_6934'></a>
<a id='line_6935'>And when Dame Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, heard of this feast</a>
<a id='line_6936'>she went to her father and required him that he would give her leave to</a>
<a id='line_6937'>ride to that feast. The king answered: I will well ye go thither, but</a>
<a id='line_6938'>in any wise as ye love me and will have my blessing, that ye be well</a>
<a id='line_6939'>beseen in the richest wise; and look that ye spare not for no cost; ask</a>
<a id='line_6940'>and ye shall have all that you needeth. Then by the advice of Dame</a>
<a id='line_6941'>Brisen, her maiden, all thing was apparelled unto the purpose, that</a>
<a id='line_6942'>there was never no lady more richlier beseen. So she rode with twenty</a>
<a id='line_6943'>knights, and ten ladies, and gentlewomen, to the number of an hundred</a>
<a id='line_6944'>horses. And when she came to Camelot, King Arthur and Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_6945'>said, and all the knights, that Dame Elaine was the fairest and the</a>
<a id='line_6946'>best beseen lady that ever was seen in that court. And anon as King</a>
<a id='line_6947'>Arthur wist that she was come he met her and saluted her, and so did</a>
<a id='line_6948'>the most part of all the knights of the Round Table, both Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_6949'>Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Gawaine, and many more that I will not rehearse.</a>
<a id='line_6950'>But when Sir Launcelot saw her he was so ashamed, and that because he</a>
<a id='line_6951'>drew his sword on the morn when he had lain by her, that he would not</a>
<a id='line_6952'>salute her nor speak to her; and yet Sir Launcelot thought she was the</a>
<a id='line_6953'>fairest woman that ever he saw in his life-days.</a>
<a id='line_6954'></a>
<a id='line_6955'>But when Dame Elaine saw Sir Launcelot that would not speak unto her</a>
<a id='line_6956'>she was so heavy that she weened her heart would have to-brast; for wit</a>
<a id='line_6957'>you well, out of measure she loved him. And then Elaine said unto her</a>
<a id='line_6958'>woman, Dame Brisen: the unkindness of Sir Launcelot slayeth me near.</a>
<a id='line_6959'>Ah, peace, madam, said Dame Brisen, I will undertake that this night he</a>
<a id='line_6960'>shall lie with you, an ye would hold you still. That were me liefer,</a>
<a id='line_6961'>said Dame Elaine, than all the gold that is above the earth. Let me</a>
<a id='line_6962'>deal, said Dame Brisen. So when Elaine was brought unto Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_6963'>either made other good cheer by countenance, but nothing with hearts.</a>
<a id='line_6964'>But all men and women spake of the beauty of Dame Elaine, and of her</a>
<a id='line_6965'>great riches.</a>
<a id='line_6966'></a>
<a id='line_6967'>Then, at night, the queen commanded that Dame Elaine should sleep in a</a>
<a id='line_6968'>chamber nigh her chamber, and all under one roof; and so it was done as</a>
<a id='line_6969'>the queen commanded. Then the queen sent for Sir Launcelot and bade him</a>
<a id='line_6970'>come to her chamber that night: Or else I am sure, said the queen, that</a>
<a id='line_6971'>ye will go to your lady’s bed, Dame Elaine, by whom ye gat Galahad. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_6972'>madam, said Sir Launcelot, never say ye so, for that I did was against</a>
<a id='line_6973'>my will. Then, said the queen, look that ye come to me when I send for</a>
<a id='line_6974'>you. Madam, said Launcelot, I shall not fail you, but I shall be ready</a>
<a id='line_6975'>at your commandment. This bargain was soon done and made between them,</a>
<a id='line_6976'>but Dame Brisen knew it by her crafts, and told it to her lady, Dame</a>
<a id='line_6977'>Elaine. Alas, said she, how shall I do? Let me deal, said Dame Brisen,</a>
<a id='line_6978'>for I shall bring him by the hand even to your bed, and he shall ween</a>
<a id='line_6979'>that I am Queen Guenever’s messenger. Now well is me, said Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_6980'>for all the world I love not so much as I do Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_6981'></a>
<a id='line_6982'></a>
<a id='line_6983'></a>
<a id='line_6984'></a>
<a id='line_6985'>CHAPTER VIII. How Dame Brisen by enchantment brought Sir Launcelot to</a>
<a id='line_6986'>Dame Elaine’s bed, and how Queen Guenever rebuked him.</a>
<a id='line_6987'></a>
<a id='line_6988'></a>
<a id='line_6989'>So when time came that all folks were abed, Dame Brisen came to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6990'>Launcelot’s bed’s side and said: Sir Launcelot du Lake, sleep you? My</a>
<a id='line_6991'>lady, Queen Guenever, lieth and awaiteth upon you. O my fair lady, said</a>
<a id='line_6992'>Sir Launcelot, I am ready to go with you where ye will have me. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_6993'>Launcelot threw upon him a long gown, and his sword in his hand; and</a>
<a id='line_6994'>then Dame Brisen took him by the finger and led him to her lady’s bed,</a>
<a id='line_6995'>Dame Elaine; and then she departed and left them in bed together. Wit</a>
<a id='line_6996'>you well the lady was glad, and so was Sir Launcelot, for he weened</a>
<a id='line_6997'>that he had had another in his arms.</a>
<a id='line_6998'></a>
<a id='line_6999'>Now leave we them kissing and clipping, as was kindly thing; and now</a>
<a id='line_7000'>speak we of Queen Guenever that sent one of her women unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_7001'>Launcelot’s bed; and when she came there she found the bed cold, and he</a>
<a id='line_7002'>was away; so she came to the queen and told her all. Alas, said the</a>
<a id='line_7003'>queen, where is that false knight become? Then the queen was nigh out</a>
<a id='line_7004'>of her wit, and then she writhed and weltered as a mad woman, and might</a>
<a id='line_7005'>not sleep a four or five hours. Then Sir Launcelot had a condition that</a>
<a id='line_7006'>he used of custom, he would clatter in his sleep, and speak oft of his</a>
<a id='line_7007'>lady, Queen Guenever. So as Sir Launcelot had waked as long as it had</a>
<a id='line_7008'>pleased him, then by course of kind he slept, and Dame Elaine both. And</a>
<a id='line_7009'>in his sleep he talked and clattered as a jay, of the love that had</a>
<a id='line_7010'>been betwixt Queen Guenever and him. And so as he talked so loud the</a>
<a id='line_7011'>queen heard him thereas she lay in her chamber; and when she heard him</a>
<a id='line_7012'>so clatter she was nigh wood and out of her mind, and for anger and</a>
<a id='line_7013'>pain wist not what to do. And then she coughed so loud that Sir</a>
<a id='line_7014'>Launcelot awaked, and he knew her hemming. And then he knew well that</a>
<a id='line_7015'>he lay not by the queen; and therewith he leapt out of his bed as he</a>
<a id='line_7016'>had been a wood man, in his shirt, and the queen met him in the floor;</a>
<a id='line_7017'>and thus she said: False traitor knight that thou art, look thou never</a>
<a id='line_7018'>abide in my court, and avoid my chamber, and not so hardy, thou false</a>
<a id='line_7019'>traitor knight that thou art, that ever thou come in my sight. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_7020'>said Sir Launcelot; and therewith he took such an heartly sorrow at her</a>
<a id='line_7021'>words that he fell down to the floor in a swoon. And therewithal Queen</a>
<a id='line_7022'>Guenever departed. And when Sir Launcelot awoke of his swoon, he leapt</a>
<a id='line_7023'>out at a bay window into a garden, and there with thorns he was all</a>
<a id='line_7024'>to-scratched in his visage and his body; and so he ran forth he wist</a>
<a id='line_7025'>not whither, and was wild wood as ever was man; and so he ran two year,</a>
<a id='line_7026'>and never man might have grace to know him.</a>
<a id='line_7027'></a>

<a id='line_7031'>CHAPTER IX. How Dame Elaine was commanded by Queen Guenever to avoid</a>
<a id='line_7032'>the court, and how Sir Launcelot became mad.</a>
<a id='line_7033'></a>
<a id='line_7034'></a>
<a id='line_7035'>Now turn we unto Queen Guenever and to the fair Lady Elaine, that when</a>
<a id='line_7036'>Dame Elaine heard the queen so to rebuke Sir Launcelot, and also she</a>
<a id='line_7037'>saw how he swooned, and how he leaped out at a bay window, then she</a>
<a id='line_7038'>said unto Queen Guenever: Madam, ye are greatly to blame for Sir</a>
<a id='line_7039'>Launcelot, for now have ye lost him, for I saw and heard by his</a>
<a id='line_7040'>countenance that he is mad for ever. Alas, madam, ye do great sin, and</a>
<a id='line_7041'>to yourself great dishonour, for ye have a lord of your own, and</a>
<a id='line_7042'>therefore it is your part to love him; for there is no queen in this</a>
<a id='line_7043'>world hath such another king as ye have. And, if ye were not, I might</a>
<a id='line_7044'>have the love of my lord Sir Launcelot; and cause I have to love him</a>
<a id='line_7045'>for he had my maidenhood, and by him I have borne a fair son, and his</a>
<a id='line_7046'>name is Galahad, and he shall be in his time the best knight of the</a>
<a id='line_7047'>world. Dame Elaine, said the queen, when it is daylight I charge you</a>
<a id='line_7048'>and command you to avoid my court; and for the love ye owe unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_7049'>Launcelot discover not his counsel, for an ye do, it will be his death.</a>
<a id='line_7050'>As for that, said Dame Elaine, I dare undertake he is marred for ever,</a>
<a id='line_7051'>and that have ye made; for ye, nor I, are like to rejoice him; for he</a>
<a id='line_7052'>made the most piteous groans when he leapt out at yonder bay window</a>
<a id='line_7053'>that ever I heard man make. Alas, said fair Elaine, and alas, said the</a>
<a id='line_7054'>Queen Guenever, for now I wot well we have lost him for ever.</a>
<a id='line_7055'></a>
<a id='line_7056'>So on the morn Dame Elaine took her leave to depart, and she would no</a>
<a id='line_7057'>longer abide. Then King Arthur brought her on her way with mo than an</a>
<a id='line_7058'>hundred knights through a forest. And by the way she told Sir Bors de</a>
<a id='line_7059'>Ganis all how it betid that same night, and how Sir Launcelot leapt out</a>
<a id='line_7060'>at a window, araged out of his wit. Alas, said Sir Bors, where is my</a>
<a id='line_7061'>lord, Sir Launcelot, become? Sir, said Elaine, I wot ne’er. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_7062'>Sir Bors, betwixt you both ye have destroyed that good knight. As for</a>
<a id='line_7063'>me, said Dame Elaine, I said never nor did never thing that should in</a>
<a id='line_7064'>any wise displease him, but with the rebuke that Queen Guenever gave</a>
<a id='line_7065'>him I saw him swoon to the earth; and when he awoke he took his sword</a>
<a id='line_7066'>in his hand, naked save his shirt, and leapt out at a window with the</a>
<a id='line_7067'>grisliest groan that ever I heard man make. Now farewell, Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_7068'>said Sir Bors, and hold my lord Arthur with a tale as long as ye can,</a>
<a id='line_7069'>for I will turn again to Queen Guenever and give her a hete; and I</a>
<a id='line_7070'>require you, as ever ye will have my service, make good watch and espy</a>
<a id='line_7071'>if ever ye may see my lord Sir Launcelot. Truly, said fair Elaine, I</a>
<a id='line_7072'>shall do all that I may do, for as fain would I know and wit where he</a>
<a id='line_7073'>is become, as you, or any of his kin, or Queen Guenever; and cause</a>
<a id='line_7074'>great enough have I thereto as well as any other. And wit ye well, said</a>
<a id='line_7075'>fair Elaine to Sir Bors, I would lose my life for him rather than he</a>
<a id='line_7076'>should be hurt; but alas, I cast me never for to see him, and the chief</a>
<a id='line_7077'>causer of this is Dame Guenever. Madam, said Dame Brisen, the which had</a>
<a id='line_7078'>made the enchantment before betwixt Sir Launcelot and her, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_7079'>heartily, let Sir Bors depart, and hie him with all his might as fast</a>
<a id='line_7080'>as he may to seek Sir Launcelot, for I warn you he is clean out of his</a>
<a id='line_7081'>mind; and yet he shall be well holpen an but by miracle.</a>
<a id='line_7082'></a>
<a id='line_7083'>Then wept Dame Elaine, and so did Sir Bors de Ganis; and so they</a>
<a id='line_7084'>departed, and Sir Bors rode straight unto Queen Guenever. And when she</a>
<a id='line_7085'>saw Sir Bors she wept as she were wood. Fie on your weeping, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7086'>Bors de Ganis, for ye weep never but when there is no bote. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_7087'>Sir Bors, that ever Sir Launcelot’s kin saw you, for now have ye lost</a>
<a id='line_7088'>the best knight of our blood, and he that was all our leader and our</a>
<a id='line_7089'>succour; and I dare say and make it good that all kings, christian nor</a>
<a id='line_7090'>heathen, may not find such a knight, for to speak of his nobleness and</a>
<a id='line_7091'>courtesy, with his beauty and his gentleness. Alas, said Sir Bors, what</a>
<a id='line_7092'>shall we do that be of his blood? Alas, said Sir Ector de Maris. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_7093'>said Lionel.</a>
<a id='line_7094'></a>
<a id='line_7095'></a>
<a id='line_7096'></a>
<a id='line_7097'></a>
<a id='line_7098'>CHAPTER X. What sorrow Queen Guenever made for Sir Launcelot, and how</a>
<a id='line_7099'>he was sought by knights of his kin.</a>
<a id='line_7100'></a>
<a id='line_7101'></a>
<a id='line_7102'>And when the queen heard them say so she fell to the earth in a dead</a>
<a id='line_7103'>swoon. And then Sir Bors took her up, and dawed her; and when she was</a>
<a id='line_7104'>awaked she kneeled afore the three knights, and held up both her hands,</a>
<a id='line_7105'>and besought them to seek him. And spare not for no goods but that he</a>
<a id='line_7106'>be found, for I wot he is out of his mind. And Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and</a>
<a id='line_7107'>Sir Lionel departed from the queen, for they might not abide no longer</a>
<a id='line_7108'>for sorrow. And then the queen sent them treasure enough for their</a>
<a id='line_7109'>expenses, and so they took their horses and their armour, and departed.</a>
<a id='line_7110'>And then they rode from country to country, in forests, and in</a>
<a id='line_7111'>wilderness, and in wastes; and ever they laid watch both at forests and</a>
<a id='line_7112'>at all manner of men as they rode, to hearken and spere after him, as</a>
<a id='line_7113'>he that was a naked man, in his shirt, with a sword in his hand. And</a>
<a id='line_7114'>thus they rode nigh a quarter of a year, endlong and overthwart, in</a>
<a id='line_7115'>many places, forests and wilderness, and oft-times were evil lodged for</a>
<a id='line_7116'>his sake; and yet for all their labour and seeking could they never</a>
<a id='line_7117'>hear word of him. And wit you well these three knights were passing</a>
<a id='line_7118'>sorry.</a>
<a id='line_7119'></a>
<a id='line_7120'>Then at the last Sir Bors and his fellows met with a knight that hight</a>
<a id='line_7121'>Sir Melion de Tartare. Now fair knight, said Sir Bors, whither be ye</a>
<a id='line_7122'>away? for they knew either other afore time. Sir, said Melion, I am in</a>
<a id='line_7123'>the way toward the court of King Arthur. Then we pray you, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7124'>Bors, that ye will tell my lord Arthur, and my lady, Queen Guenever,</a>
<a id='line_7125'>and all the fellowship of the Round Table, that we cannot in no wise</a>
<a id='line_7126'>hear tell where Sir Launcelot is become. Then Sir Melion departed from</a>
<a id='line_7127'>them, and said that he would tell the king, and the queen, and all the</a>
<a id='line_7128'>fellowship of the Round Table, as they had desired him. So when Sir</a>
<a id='line_7129'>Melion came to the court of King Arthur he told the king, and the</a>
<a id='line_7130'>queen, and all the fellowship of the Round Table, what Sir Bors had</a>
<a id='line_7131'>said of Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_7132'>Desirous, Sir Aglovale, and Sir Percivale de Galis took upon them by</a>
<a id='line_7133'>the great desire of King Arthur, and in especial by the queen, to seek</a>
<a id='line_7134'>throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, to find Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_7135'>with them rode eighteen knights mo to bear them fellowship; and wit ye</a>
<a id='line_7136'>well, they lacked no manner of spending; and so were they three and</a>
<a id='line_7137'>twenty knights.</a>
<a id='line_7138'></a>
<a id='line_7139'>Now turn we to Sir Launcelot, and speak we of his care and woe, and</a>
<a id='line_7140'>what pain he there endured; for cold, hunger, and thirst, he had</a>
<a id='line_7141'>plenty. And thus as these noble knights rode together, they by one</a>
<a id='line_7142'>assent departed, and then they rode by two, by three, and by four, and</a>
<a id='line_7143'>by five, and ever they assigned where they should meet. And so Sir</a>
<a id='line_7144'>Aglovale and Sir Percivale rode together unto their mother that was a</a>
<a id='line_7145'>queen in those days. And when she saw her two sons, for joy she wept</a>
<a id='line_7146'>tenderly. And then she said: Ah, my dear sons, when your father was</a>
<a id='line_7147'>slain he left me four sons, of the which now be twain slain. And for</a>
<a id='line_7148'>the death of my noble son, Sir Lamorak, shall my heart never be glad.</a>
<a id='line_7149'>And then she kneeled down upon her knees to-fore Aglovale and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7150'>Percivale, and besought them to abide at home with her. Ah, sweet</a>
<a id='line_7151'>mother, said Sir Percivale, we may not, for we be come of king’s blood</a>
<a id='line_7152'>of both parties, and therefore, mother, it is our kind to haunt arms</a>
<a id='line_7153'>and noble deeds. Alas, my sweet sons, then she said, for your sakes I</a>
<a id='line_7154'>shall lose my liking and lust, and then wind and weather I may not</a>
<a id='line_7155'>endure, what for the death of your father, King Pellinore, that was</a>
<a id='line_7156'>shamefully slain by the hands of Sir Gawaine, and his brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_7157'>Gaheris: and they slew him not manly but by treason. Ah, my dear sons,</a>
<a id='line_7158'>this is a piteous complaint for me of your father’s death, considering</a>
<a id='line_7159'>also the death of Sir Lamorak, that of knighthood had but few fellows.</a>
<a id='line_7160'>Now, my dear sons, have this in your mind. Then there was but weeping</a>
<a id='line_7161'>and sobbing in the court when they should depart, and she fell</a>
<a id='line_7162'>a-swooning in midst of the court.</a>
<a id='line_7163'></a>

<a id='line_7167'>CHAPTER XI. How a servant of Sir Aglovale’s was slain, and what</a>
<a id='line_7168'>vengeance Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale did therefore.</a>
<a id='line_7169'></a>
<a id='line_7170'></a>
<a id='line_7171'>And when she was awaked she sent a squire after them with spending</a>
<a id='line_7172'>enough. And so when the squire had overtaken them, they would not</a>
<a id='line_7173'>suffer him to ride with them, but sent him home again to comfort their</a>
<a id='line_7174'>mother, praying her meekly of her blessing. And so this squire was</a>
<a id='line_7175'>benighted, and by misfortune he happened to come to a castle where</a>
<a id='line_7176'>dwelled a baron. And so when the squire was come into the castle, the</a>
<a id='line_7177'>lord asked him from whence he came, and whom he served. My lord, said</a>
<a id='line_7178'>the squire, I serve a good knight that is called Sir Aglovale: the</a>
<a id='line_7179'>squire said it to good intent, weening unto him to have been more</a>
<a id='line_7180'>forborne for Sir Aglovale’s sake, than he had said he had served the</a>
<a id='line_7181'>queen, Aglovale’s mother. Well, my fellow, said the lord of that</a>
<a id='line_7182'>castle, for Sir Aglovale’s sake thou shalt have evil lodging, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_7183'>Aglovale slew my brother, and therefore thou shalt die on part of</a>
<a id='line_7184'>payment. And then that lord commanded his men to have him away and slay</a>
<a id='line_7185'>him; and so they did, and so pulled him out of the castle, and there</a>
<a id='line_7186'>they slew him without mercy.</a>
<a id='line_7187'></a>
<a id='line_7188'>Right so on the morn came Sir Aglovale and Sir Percivale riding by a</a>
<a id='line_7189'>churchyard, where men and women were busy, and beheld the dead squire,</a>
<a id='line_7190'>and they thought to bury him. What is there, said Sir Aglovale, that ye</a>
<a id='line_7191'>behold so fast? A good man stert forth and said: Fair knight, here</a>
<a id='line_7192'>lieth a squire slain shamefully this night. How was he slain, fair</a>
<a id='line_7193'>fellow? said Sir Aglovale. My fair sir, said the man, the lord of this</a>
<a id='line_7194'>castle lodged this squire this night; and because he said he was</a>
<a id='line_7195'>servant unto a good knight that is with King Arthur, his name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_7196'>Aglovale, therefore the lord commanded to slay him, and for this cause</a>
<a id='line_7197'>is he slain. Gramercy, said Sir Aglovale, and ye shall see his death</a>
<a id='line_7198'>revenged lightly; for I am that same knight for whom this squire was</a>
<a id='line_7199'>slain.</a>
<a id='line_7200'></a>
<a id='line_7201'>Then Sir Aglovale called unto him Sir Percivale, and bade him alight</a>
<a id='line_7202'>lightly; and so they alighted both, and betook their horses to their</a>
<a id='line_7203'>men, and so they yede on foot into the castle. And all so soon as they</a>
<a id='line_7204'>were within the castle gate Sir Aglovale bade the porter: Go thou unto</a>
<a id='line_7205'>thy lord and tell him that I am Sir Aglovale for whom this squire was</a>
<a id='line_7206'>slain this night. Anon the porter told this to his lord, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_7207'>Goodewin. Anon he armed him, and then he came into the court and said:</a>
<a id='line_7208'>Which of you is Sir Aglovale? Here I am, said Aglovale: for what cause</a>
<a id='line_7209'>slewest thou this night my mother’s squire? I slew him, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7210'>Goodewin, because of thee, for thou slewest my brother, Sir Gawdelin.</a>
<a id='line_7211'>As for thy brother, said Sir Aglovale, I avow it I slew him, for he was</a>
<a id='line_7212'>a false knight and a betrayer of ladies and of good knights; and for</a>
<a id='line_7213'>the death of my squire thou shalt die. I defy thee, said Sir Goodewin.</a>
<a id='line_7214'>Then they lashed together as eagerly as it had been two lions, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7215'>Percivale he fought with all the remnant that would fight. And within a</a>
<a id='line_7216'>while Sir Percivale had slain all that would withstand him; for Sir</a>
<a id='line_7217'>Percivale dealt so his strokes that were so rude that there durst no</a>
<a id='line_7218'>man abide him. And within a while Sir Aglovale had Sir Goodewin at the</a>
<a id='line_7219'>earth, and there he unlaced his helm, and struck off his head. And then</a>
<a id='line_7220'>they departed and took their horses; and then they let carry the dead</a>
<a id='line_7221'>squire unto a priory, and there they interred him.</a>
<a id='line_7222'></a>
<a id='line_7223'></a>
<a id='line_7224'></a>
<a id='line_7225'></a>
<a id='line_7226'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Pervivale departed secretly from his brother, and</a>
<a id='line_7227'>how he loosed a knight bound with a chain, and of other doings.</a>
<a id='line_7228'></a>
<a id='line_7229'></a>
<a id='line_7230'>And when this was done they rode into many countries, ever inquiring</a>
<a id='line_7231'>after Sir Launcelot, but never they could hear of him; and at the last</a>
<a id='line_7232'>they came to a castle that hight Cardican, and there Sir Percivale and</a>
<a id='line_7233'>Sir Aglovale were lodged together. And privily about midnight Sir</a>
<a id='line_7234'>Percivale came to Aglovale’s squire and said: Arise and make thee</a>
<a id='line_7235'>ready, for ye and I will ride away secretly. Sir, said the squire, I</a>
<a id='line_7236'>would full fain ride with you where ye would have me, but an my lord,</a>
<a id='line_7237'>your brother, take me he will slay me. As for that care thou not, for I</a>
<a id='line_7238'>shall be thy warrant.</a>
<a id='line_7239'></a>
<a id='line_7240'>And so Sir Percivale rode till it was after noon, and then he came upon</a>
<a id='line_7241'>a bridge of stone, and there he found a knight that was bound with a</a>
<a id='line_7242'>chain fast about the waist unto a pillar of stone. O fair knight, said</a>
<a id='line_7243'>that bound knight, I require thee loose me of my bonds. What knight are</a>
<a id='line_7244'>ye, said Sir Percivale, and for what cause are ye so bound? Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_7245'>shall tell you, said that knight: I am a knight of the Table Round, and</a>
<a id='line_7246'>my name is Sir Persides; and thus by adventure I came this way, and</a>
<a id='line_7247'>here I lodged in this castle at the bridge foot, and therein dwelleth</a>
<a id='line_7248'>an uncourteous lady; and because she proffered me to be her paramour,</a>
<a id='line_7249'>and I refused her, she set her men upon me suddenly or ever I might</a>
<a id='line_7250'>come to my weapon; and thus they bound me, and here I wot well I shall</a>
<a id='line_7251'>die but if some man of worship break my bands. Be ye of good cheer,</a>
<a id='line_7252'>said Sir Percivale, and because ye are a knight of the Round Table as</a>
<a id='line_7253'>well as I, I trust to God to break your bands. And therewith Sir</a>
<a id='line_7254'>Percivale pulled out his sword and struck at the chain with such a</a>
<a id='line_7255'>might that he cut a-two the chain, and through Sir Persides’ hauberk</a>
<a id='line_7256'>and hurt him a little. O Jesu, said Sir Persides, that was a mighty</a>
<a id='line_7257'>stroke as ever I felt one, for had not the chain been ye had slain me.</a>
<a id='line_7258'></a>
<a id='line_7259'>And therewithal Sir Persides saw a knight coming out of a castle all</a>
<a id='line_7260'>that ever he might fling. Beware, sir, said Sir Persides, yonder cometh</a>
<a id='line_7261'>a man that will have ado with you. Let him come, said Sir Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_7262'>And so he met with that knight in midst of the bridge; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7263'>Percivale gave him such a buffet that he smote him quite from his horse</a>
<a id='line_7264'>and over a part of the bridge, that, had not been a little vessel under</a>
<a id='line_7265'>the bridge, that knight had been drowned. And then Sir Percivale took</a>
<a id='line_7266'>the knight’s horse and made Sir Persides to mount up him; and so they</a>
<a id='line_7267'>rode unto the castle, and bade the lady deliver Sir Persides’ servants,</a>
<a id='line_7268'>or else he would slay all that ever he found; and so for fear she</a>
<a id='line_7269'>delivered them all. Then was Sir Percivale ware of a lady that stood in</a>
<a id='line_7270'>that tower. Ah, madam, said Sir Percivale, what use and custom is that</a>
<a id='line_7271'>in a lady to destroy good knights but if they will be your paramour?</a>
<a id='line_7272'>Forsooth this is a shameful custom of a lady, and if I had not a great</a>
<a id='line_7273'>matter in my hand I should fordo your evil customs.</a>
<a id='line_7274'></a>
<a id='line_7275'>And so Sir Persides brought Sir Percivale unto his own castle, and</a>
<a id='line_7276'>there he made him great cheer all that night. And on the morn, when Sir</a>
<a id='line_7277'>Percivale had heard mass and broken his fast, he bade Sir Persides ride</a>
<a id='line_7278'>unto King Arthur: And tell the king how that ye met with me; and tell</a>
<a id='line_7279'>my brother, Sir Aglovale, how I rescued you; and bid him seek not after</a>
<a id='line_7280'>me, for I am in the quest to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, and though he</a>
<a id='line_7281'>seek me he shall not find me; and tell him I will never see him, nor</a>
<a id='line_7282'>the court, till I have found Sir Launcelot. Also tell Sir Kay the</a>
<a id='line_7283'>Seneschal, and to Sir Mordred, that I trust to Jesu to be of as great</a>
<a id='line_7284'>worthiness as either of them, for tell them I shall never forget their</a>
<a id='line_7285'>mocks and scorns that they did to me that day that I was made knight;</a>
<a id='line_7286'>and tell them I will never see that court till men speak more worship</a>
<a id='line_7287'>of me than ever men did of any of them both. And so Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_7288'>departed from Sir Percivale, and then he rode unto King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_7289'>told there of Sir Percivale. And when Sir Aglovale heard him speak of</a>
<a id='line_7290'>his brother Sir Percivale, he said: He departed from me unkindly.</a>
<a id='line_7291'></a>

<a id='line_7295'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Percivale met with Sir Ector, and how they fought</a>
<a id='line_7296'>long, and each had almost slain other.</a>
<a id='line_7297'></a>
<a id='line_7298'></a>
<a id='line_7299'>Sir, said Sir Persides, on my life he shall prove a noble knight as any</a>
<a id='line_7300'>now is living. And when he saw Sir Kay and Sir Mordred, Sir Persides</a>
<a id='line_7301'>said thus: My fair lords both, Sir Percivale greeteth you well both,</a>
<a id='line_7302'>and he sent you word by me that he trusteth to God or ever he come to</a>
<a id='line_7303'>the court again to be of as great noblesse as ever were ye both, and mo</a>
<a id='line_7304'>men to speak of his noblesse than ever they did of you. It may well be,</a>
<a id='line_7305'>said Sir Kay and Sir Mordred, but at that time when he was made knight</a>
<a id='line_7306'>he was full unlike to prove a good knight. As for that, said King</a>
<a id='line_7307'>Arthur, he must needs prove a good knight, for his father and his</a>
<a id='line_7308'>brethren were noble knights.</a>
<a id='line_7309'></a>
<a id='line_7310'>And now will we turn unto Sir Percivale that rode long; and in a forest</a>
<a id='line_7311'>he met a knight with a broken shield and a broken helm; and as soon as</a>
<a id='line_7312'>either saw other readily they made them ready to joust, and so hurtled</a>
<a id='line_7313'>together with all the might of their horses, and met together so hard,</a>
<a id='line_7314'>that Sir Percivale was smitten to the earth. And then Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_7315'>arose lightly, and cast his shield on his shoulder and drew his sword,</a>
<a id='line_7316'>and bade the other knight: Alight, and do we battle unto the uttermost.</a>
<a id='line_7317'>Will ye more? said that knight. And therewith he alighted, and put his</a>
<a id='line_7318'>horse from him; and then they came together an easy pace, and there</a>
<a id='line_7319'>they lashed together with noble swords, and sometime they struck and</a>
<a id='line_7320'>sometime they foined, and either gave other many great wounds. Thus</a>
<a id='line_7321'>they fought near half a day, and never rested but right little, and</a>
<a id='line_7322'>there was none of them both that had less wounds than fifteen, and they</a>
<a id='line_7323'>bled so much that it was marvel they stood on their feet. But this</a>
<a id='line_7324'>knight that fought with Sir Percivale was a proved knight and a</a>
<a id='line_7325'>wise-fighting knight, and Sir Percivale was young and strong, not</a>
<a id='line_7326'>knowing in fighting as the other was.</a>
<a id='line_7327'></a>
<a id='line_7328'>Then Sir Percivale spoke first, and said: Sir knight, hold thy hand a</a>
<a id='line_7329'>while still, for we have fought for a simple matter and quarrel</a>
<a id='line_7330'>overlong, and therefore I require thee tell me thy name, for I was</a>
<a id='line_7331'>never or this time matched. So God me help, said that knight, and never</a>
<a id='line_7332'>or this time was there never knight that wounded me so sore as thou</a>
<a id='line_7333'>hast done, and yet have I fought in many battles; and now shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_7334'>wit that I am a knight of the Table Round, and my name is Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_7335'>Maris, brother unto the good knight, Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_7336'>Sir Percivale, and my name is Sir Percivale de Galis that hath made my</a>
<a id='line_7337'>quest to seek Sir Launcelot, and now I am siker that I shall never</a>
<a id='line_7338'>finish my quest, for ye have slain me with your hands. It is not so,</a>
<a id='line_7339'>said Sir Ector, for I am slain by your hands, and may not live.</a>
<a id='line_7340'>Therefore I require you, said Sir Ector unto Sir Percivale, ride ye</a>
<a id='line_7341'>hereby to a priory, and bring me a priest that I may receive my</a>
<a id='line_7342'>Saviour, for I may not live. And when ye come to the court of King</a>
<a id='line_7343'>Arthur tell not my brother, Sir Launcelot, how that ye slew me, for</a>
<a id='line_7344'>then he would be your mortal enemy, but ye may say that I was slain in</a>
<a id='line_7345'>my quest as I sought him. Alas, said Sir Percivale, ye say that never</a>
<a id='line_7346'>will be, for I am so faint for bleeding that I may unnethe stand, how</a>
<a id='line_7347'>should I then take my horse?</a>

<a id='line_7353'>the holy vessel of Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_7354'></a>
<a id='line_7355'></a>
<a id='line_7356'>Then they made both great dole out of measure. This will not avail,</a>
<a id='line_7357'>said Sir Percivale. And then he kneeled down and made his prayer</a>
<a id='line_7358'>devoutly unto Almighty Jesu, for he was one of the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_7359'>world that at that time was, in whom the very faith stood most in.</a>
<a id='line_7360'>Right so there came by the holy vessel of the Sangreal with all manner</a>
<a id='line_7361'>of sweetness and savour; but they could not readily see who that bare</a>
<a id='line_7362'>that vessel, but Sir Percivale had a glimmering of the vessel and of</a>
<a id='line_7363'>the maiden that bare it, for he was a perfect clean maiden; and</a>
<a id='line_7364'>forthwithal they both were as whole of hide and limb as ever they were</a>
<a id='line_7365'>in their life-days: then they gave thankings to God with great</a>
<a id='line_7366'>mildness. O Jesu, said Sir Percivale, what may this mean, that we be</a>
<a id='line_7367'>thus healed, and right now we were at the point of dying? I wot full</a>
<a id='line_7368'>well, said Sir Ector, what it is; it is an holy vessel that is borne by</a>
<a id='line_7369'>a maiden, and therein is part of the holy blood of our Lord Jesu</a>
<a id='line_7370'>Christ, blessed mote he be. But it may not be seen, said Sir Ector, but</a>
<a id='line_7371'>if it be by a perfect man. So God me help, said Sir Percivale, I saw a</a>
<a id='line_7372'>damosel, as me thought, all in white, with a vessel in both her hands,</a>
<a id='line_7373'>and forthwithal I was whole.</a>
<a id='line_7374'></a>
<a id='line_7375'>So then they took their horses and their harness, and amended their</a>
<a id='line_7376'>harness as well as they might that was broken; and so they mounted upon</a>
<a id='line_7377'>their horses, and rode talking together. And there Sir Ector de Maris</a>
<a id='line_7378'>told Sir Percivale how he had sought his brother, Sir Launcelot, long,</a>
<a id='line_7379'>and never could hear witting of him: In many strange adventures have I</a>
<a id='line_7380'>been in this quest. And so either told other of their adventures.</a>

<a id='line_7392'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot in his madness took a sword and fought</a>
<a id='line_7393'>with a knight, and leapt in a bed.</a>
<a id='line_7394'></a>
<a id='line_7395'></a>
<a id='line_7396'>And now leave we of a while of Sir Ector and of Sir Percivale, and</a>
<a id='line_7397'>speak we of Sir Launcelot that suffered and endured many sharp showers,</a>
<a id='line_7398'>that ever ran wild wood from place to place, and lived by fruit and</a>
<a id='line_7399'>such as he might get, and drank water two year; and other clothing had</a>
<a id='line_7400'>he but little but his shirt and his breech. Thus as Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7401'>wandered here and there he came in a fair meadow where he found a</a>
<a id='line_7402'>pavilion; and there by, upon a tree, there hung a white shield, and two</a>
<a id='line_7403'>swords hung thereby, and two spears leaned there by a tree. And when</a>
<a id='line_7404'>Sir Launcelot saw the swords, anon he leapt to the one sword, and took</a>
<a id='line_7405'>it in his hand, and drew it out. And then he lashed at the shield, that</a>
<a id='line_7406'>all the meadow rang of the dints, that he gave such a noise as ten</a>
<a id='line_7407'>knights had foughten together.</a>
<a id='line_7408'></a>
<a id='line_7409'>Then came forth a dwarf, and leapt unto Sir Launcelot, and would have</a>
<a id='line_7410'>had the sword out of his hand. And then Sir Launcelot took him by the</a>
<a id='line_7411'>both shoulders and threw him to the ground upon his neck, that he had</a>
<a id='line_7412'>almost broken his neck; and therewithal the dwarf cried help. Then came</a>
<a id='line_7413'>forth a likely knight, and well apparelled in scarlet furred with</a>
<a id='line_7414'>minever. And anon as he saw Sir Launcelot he deemed that he should be</a>
<a id='line_7415'>out of his wit. And then he said with fair speech: Good man, lay down</a>
<a id='line_7416'>that sword, for as meseemeth thou hadst more need of sleep and of warm</a>
<a id='line_7417'>clothes than to wield that sword. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, come</a>
<a id='line_7418'>not too nigh, for an thou do, wit thou well I will slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_7419'></a>
<a id='line_7420'>And when the knight of the pavilion saw that, he stert backward within</a>
<a id='line_7421'>the pavilion. And then the dwarf armed him lightly; and so the knight</a>
<a id='line_7422'>thought by force and might to take the sword from Sir Launcelot, and so</a>
<a id='line_7423'>he came stepping out; and when Sir Launcelot saw him come so all armed</a>
<a id='line_7424'>with his sword in his hand, then Sir Launcelot flew to him with such a</a>
<a id='line_7425'>might, and hit him upon the helm such a buffet, that the stroke</a>
<a id='line_7426'>troubled his brains, and therewith the sword brake in three. And the</a>
<a id='line_7427'>knight fell to the earth as he had been dead, the blood brasting out of</a>
<a id='line_7428'>his mouth, the nose, and the ears. And then Sir Launcelot ran into the</a>
<a id='line_7429'>pavilion, and rushed even into the warm bed; and there was a lady in</a>
<a id='line_7430'>that bed, and she gat her smock, and ran out of the pavilion. And when</a>
<a id='line_7431'>she saw her lord lie at the ground like to be dead, then she cried and</a>
<a id='line_7432'>wept as she had been mad. Then with her noise the knight awaked out of</a>
<a id='line_7433'>his swoon, and looked up weakly with his eyes; and then he asked her,</a>
<a id='line_7434'>where was that mad man that had given him such a buffet: For such a</a>
<a id='line_7435'>buffet had I never of man’s hand. Sir, said the dwarf, it is not</a>
<a id='line_7436'>worship to hurt him, for he is a man out of his wit; and doubt ye not</a>
<a id='line_7437'>he hath been a man of great worship, and for some heartly sorrow that</a>
<a id='line_7438'>he hath taken, he is fallen mad; and me beseemeth, said the dwarf, he</a>
<a id='line_7439'>resembleth much unto Sir Launcelot, for him I saw at the great</a>
<a id='line_7440'>tournament beside Lonazep. Jesu defend, said that knight, that ever</a>
<a id='line_7441'>that noble knight, Sir Launcelot, should be in such a plight; but</a>
<a id='line_7442'>whatsomever he be, said that knight, harm will I none do him: and this</a>
<a id='line_7443'>knight’s name was Bliant. Then he said unto the dwarf: Go thou fast on</a>
<a id='line_7444'>horseback, unto my brother Sir Selivant, that is at the Castle Blank,</a>
<a id='line_7445'>and tell him of mine adventure, and bid him bring with him an horse</a>
<a id='line_7446'>litter, and then will we bear this knight unto my castle.</a>

<a id='line_7453'></a>
<a id='line_7454'></a>
<a id='line_7455'>So the dwarf rode fast, and he came again and brought Sir Selivant with</a>
<a id='line_7456'>him, and six men with an horse litter; and so they took up the feather</a>
<a id='line_7457'>bed with Sir Launcelot, and so carried all away with them unto the</a>
<a id='line_7458'>Castle Blank, and he never awaked till he was within the castle. And</a>
<a id='line_7459'>then they bound his hands and his feet, and gave him good meats and</a>
<a id='line_7460'>good drinks, and brought him again to his strength and his fairness;</a>
<a id='line_7461'>but in his wit they could not bring him again, nor to know himself.</a>
<a id='line_7462'>Thus was Sir Launcelot there more than a year and a half, honestly</a>
<a id='line_7463'>arrayed and fair faren withal.</a>
<a id='line_7464'></a>
<a id='line_7465'>Then upon a day this lord of that castle, Sir Bliant, took his arms, on</a>
<a id='line_7466'>horseback, with a spear, to seek adventures. And as he rode in a forest</a>
<a id='line_7467'>there met with him two knights adventurous, the one was Breuse Saunce</a>
<a id='line_7468'>Pité, and his brother, Sir Bertelot; and these two ran both at once</a>
<a id='line_7469'>upon Sir Bliant, and brake their spears upon his body. And then they</a>
<a id='line_7470'>drew out swords and made great battle, and fought long together. But at</a>
<a id='line_7471'>the last Sir Bliant was sore wounded, and felt himself faint; and then</a>
<a id='line_7472'>he fled on horseback toward his castle. And as they came hurling under</a>
<a id='line_7473'>the castle whereas Sir Launcelot lay in a window, [he] saw how two</a>
<a id='line_7474'>knights laid upon Sir Bliant with their swords. And when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7475'>saw that, yet as wood as he was he was sorry for his lord, Sir Bliant.</a>
<a id='line_7476'>And then Sir Launcelot brake the chains from his legs and off his arms,</a>
<a id='line_7477'>and in the breaking he hurt his hands sore; and so Sir Launcelot ran</a>
<a id='line_7478'>out at a postern, and there he met with the two knights that chased Sir</a>
<a id='line_7479'>Bliant; and there he pulled down Sir Bertelot with his bare hands from</a>
<a id='line_7480'>his horse, and therewithal he wrothe his sword out of his hand; and so</a>
<a id='line_7481'>he leapt unto Sir Breuse, and gave him such a buffet upon the head that</a>
<a id='line_7482'>he tumbled backward over his horse’s croup. And when Sir Bertelot saw</a>
<a id='line_7483'>there his brother have such a fall, he gat a spear in his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_7484'>would have run Sir Launcelot through: that saw Sir Bliant, and struck</a>
<a id='line_7485'>off the hand of Sir Bertelot. And then Sir Breuse and Sir Bertelot gat</a>
<a id='line_7486'>their horses and fled away.</a>
<a id='line_7487'></a>
<a id='line_7488'>When Sir Selivant came and saw what Sir Launcelot had done for his</a>
<a id='line_7489'>brother, then he thanked God, and so did his brother, that ever they</a>
<a id='line_7490'>did him any good. But when Sir Bliant saw that Sir Launcelot was hurt</a>
<a id='line_7491'>with the breaking of his irons, then was he heavy that ever he bound</a>
<a id='line_7492'>him. Bind him no more, said Sir Selivant, for he is happy and gracious.</a>
<a id='line_7493'>Then they made great joy of Sir Launcelot, and they bound him no more;</a>
<a id='line_7494'>and so he abode there an half year and more. And on the morn early Sir</a>
<a id='line_7495'>Launcelot was ware where came a great boar with many hounds nigh him.</a>
<a id='line_7496'>But the boar was so big there might no hounds tear him; and the hunters</a>
<a id='line_7497'>came after, blowing their horns, both upon horseback and some upon</a>
<a id='line_7498'>foot; and then Sir Launcelot was ware where one alighted and tied his</a>
<a id='line_7499'>horse to a tree, and leaned his spear against the tree.</a>
<a id='line_7500'></a>
<a id='line_7501'></a>
<a id='line_7502'></a>
<a id='line_7503'></a>
<a id='line_7504'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot fought against a boar and slew him, and</a>
<a id='line_7505'>how he was hurt, and brought unto an hermitage.</a>
<a id='line_7506'></a>
<a id='line_7507'></a>
<a id='line_7508'>So came Sir Launcelot and found the horse bounden till a tree, and a</a>
<a id='line_7509'>spear leaning against a tree, and a sword tied to the saddle bow; and</a>
<a id='line_7510'>then Sir Launcelot leapt into the saddle and gat that spear in his</a>
<a id='line_7511'>hand, and then he rode after the boar; and then Sir Launcelot was ware</a>
<a id='line_7512'>where the boar set his arse to a tree fast by an hermitage. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_7513'>Launcelot ran at the boar with his spear, and therewith the boar turned</a>
<a id='line_7514'>him nimbly, and rove out the lungs and the heart of the horse, so that</a>
<a id='line_7515'>Launcelot fell to the earth; and, or ever Sir Launcelot might get from</a>
<a id='line_7516'>the horse, the boar rove him on the brawn of the thigh up to the hough</a>
<a id='line_7517'>bone. And then Sir Launcelot was wroth, and up he gat upon his feet,</a>
<a id='line_7518'>and drew his sword, and he smote off the boar’s head at one stroke. And</a>
<a id='line_7519'>therewithal came out the hermit, and saw him have such a wound. Then</a>
<a id='line_7520'>the hermit came to Sir Launcelot and bemoaned him, and would have had</a>
<a id='line_7521'>him home unto his hermitage; but when Sir Launcelot heard him speak, he</a>
<a id='line_7522'>was so wroth with his wound that he ran upon the hermit to have slain</a>
<a id='line_7523'>him, and the hermit ran away. And when Sir Launcelot might not overget</a>
<a id='line_7524'>him, he threw his sword after him, for Sir Launcelot might go no</a>
<a id='line_7525'>further for bleeding; then the hermit turned again, and asked Sir</a>
<a id='line_7526'>Launcelot how he was hurt. Fellow, said Sir Launcelot, this boar hath</a>
<a id='line_7527'>bitten me sore. Then come with me, said the hermit, and I shall heal</a>
<a id='line_7528'>you. Go thy way, said Sir Launcelot, and deal not with me.</a>
<a id='line_7529'></a>
<a id='line_7530'>Then the hermit ran his way, and there he met with a good knight with</a>
<a id='line_7531'>many men. Sir, said the hermit, here is fast by my place the goodliest</a>
<a id='line_7532'>man that ever I saw, and he is sore wounded with a boar, and yet he</a>
<a id='line_7533'>hath slain the boar. But well I wot, said the hermit, and he be not</a>
<a id='line_7534'>holpen, that goodly man shall die of that wound, and that were great</a>
<a id='line_7535'>pity. Then that knight at the desire of the hermit gat a cart, and in</a>
<a id='line_7536'>that cart that knight put the boar and Sir Launcelot, for Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7537'>was so feeble that they might right easily deal with him; and so Sir</a>
<a id='line_7538'>Launcelot was brought unto the hermitage, and there the hermit healed</a>
<a id='line_7539'>him of his wound. But the hermit might not find Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_7540'>sustenance, and so he impaired and waxed feeble, both of his body and</a>
<a id='line_7541'>of his wit: for the default of his sustenance he waxed more wooder than</a>
<a id='line_7542'>he was aforehand.</a>
<a id='line_7543'></a>
<a id='line_7544'>And then upon a day Sir Launcelot ran his way into the forest; and by</a>
<a id='line_7545'>adventure he came to the city of Corbin, where Dame Elaine was, that</a>
<a id='line_7546'>bare Galahad, Sir Launcelot’s son. And so when he was entered into the</a>
<a id='line_7547'>town he ran through the town to the castle; and then all the young men</a>
<a id='line_7548'>of that city ran after Sir Launcelot, and there they threw turves at</a>
<a id='line_7549'>him, and gave him many sad strokes. And ever as Sir Launcelot might</a>
<a id='line_7550'>overreach any of them, he threw them so that they would never come in</a>
<a id='line_7551'>his hands no more; for of some he brake the legs and the arms, and so</a>
<a id='line_7552'>fled into the castle; and then came out knights and squires and rescued</a>
<a id='line_7553'>Sir Launcelot. And when they beheld him and looked upon his person,</a>
<a id='line_7554'>they thought they saw never so goodly a man. And when they saw so many</a>
<a id='line_7555'>wounds upon him, all they deemed that he had been a man of worship. And</a>
<a id='line_7556'>then they ordained him clothes to his body, and straw underneath him,</a>
<a id='line_7557'>and a little house. And then every day they would throw him meat, and</a>
<a id='line_7558'>set him drink, but there was but few would bring him meat to his hands.</a>
<a id='line_7559'></a>
<a id='line_7560'></a>
<a id='line_7561'></a>
<a id='line_7562'></a>
<a id='line_7563'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was known by Dame Elaine, and was borne</a>
<a id='line_7564'>into a chamber and after healed by the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_7565'></a>
<a id='line_7566'></a>
<a id='line_7567'>So it befell that King Pelles had a nephew, his name was Castor; and so</a>
<a id='line_7568'>he desired of the king to be made knight, and so at the request of this</a>
<a id='line_7569'>Castor the king made him knight at the feast of Candlemas. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_7570'>Castor was made knight, that same day he gave many gowns. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_7571'>Castor sent for the fool—that was Sir Launcelot. And when he was come</a>
<a id='line_7572'>afore Sir Castor, he gave Sir Launcelot a robe of scarlet and all that</a>
<a id='line_7573'>longed unto him. And when Sir Launcelot was so arrayed like a knight,</a>
<a id='line_7574'>he was the seemliest man in all the court, and none so well made. So</a>
<a id='line_7575'>when he saw his time he went into the garden, and there Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7576'>laid him down by a well and slept. And so at-after noon Dame Elaine and</a>
<a id='line_7577'>her maidens came into the garden to play them; and as they roamed up</a>
<a id='line_7578'>and down one of Dame Elaine’s maidens espied where lay a goodly man by</a>
<a id='line_7579'>the well sleeping, and anon showed him to Dame Elaine. Peace, said Dame</a>
<a id='line_7580'>Elaine, and say no word: and then she brought Dame Elaine where he lay.</a>
<a id='line_7581'>And when that she beheld him, anon she fell in remembrance of him, and</a>
<a id='line_7582'>knew him verily for Sir Launcelot; and therewithal she fell a-weeping</a>
<a id='line_7583'>so heartily that she sank even to the earth; and when she had thus wept</a>
<a id='line_7584'>a great while, then she arose and called her maidens and said she was</a>
<a id='line_7585'>sick.</a>
<a id='line_7586'></a>
<a id='line_7587'>And so she yede out of the garden, and she went straight to her father,</a>
<a id='line_7588'>and there she took him apart by herself; and then she said: O father,</a>
<a id='line_7589'>now have I need of your help, and but if that ye help me farewell my</a>
<a id='line_7590'>good days for ever. What is that, daughter? said King Pelles. Sir, she</a>
<a id='line_7591'>said, thus is it: in your garden I went for to sport, and there, by the</a>
<a id='line_7592'>well, I found Sir Launcelot du Lake sleeping. I may not believe that,</a>
<a id='line_7593'>said King Pelles. Sir, she said, truly he is there, and meseemeth he</a>
<a id='line_7594'>should be distract out of his wit. Then hold you still, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_7595'>and let me deal. Then the king called to him such as he most trusted, a</a>
<a id='line_7596'>four persons, and Dame Elaine, his daughter. And when they came to the</a>
<a id='line_7597'>well and beheld Sir Launcelot, anon Dame Brisen knew him. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_7598'>Dame Brisen, we must be wise how we deal with him, for this knight is</a>
<a id='line_7599'>out of his mind, and if we awake him rudely what he will do we all know</a>
<a id='line_7600'>not; but ye shall abide, and I shall throw such an enchantment upon him</a>
<a id='line_7601'>that he shall not awake within the space of an hour; and so she did.</a>
<a id='line_7602'></a>
<a id='line_7603'>Then within a little while after, the king commanded that all people</a>
<a id='line_7604'>should avoid, that none should be in that way thereas the king would</a>
<a id='line_7605'>come. And so when this was done, these four men and these ladies laid</a>
<a id='line_7606'>hand on Sir Launcelot, and so they bare him into a tower, and so into a</a>
<a id='line_7607'>chamber where was the holy vessel of the Sangreal, and by force Sir</a>
<a id='line_7608'>Launcelot was laid by that holy vessel; and there came an holy man and</a>
<a id='line_7609'>unhilled that vessel, and so by miracle and by virtue of that holy</a>
<a id='line_7610'>vessel Sir Launcelot was healed and recovered. And when that he was</a>
<a id='line_7611'>awaked he groaned and sighed, and complained greatly that he was</a>
<a id='line_7612'>passing sore.</a>
<a id='line_7613'></a>
<a id='line_7614'></a>
<a id='line_7615'></a>
<a id='line_7616'></a>
<a id='line_7617'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot, after that he was whole and had his mind,</a>
<a id='line_7618'>he was ashamed, and how that Elaine desired a castle for him.</a>
<a id='line_7619'></a>
<a id='line_7620'></a>
<a id='line_7621'>And when Sir Launcelot saw King Pelles and Elaine, he waxed ashamed and</a>
<a id='line_7622'>said thus: O Lord Jesu, how came I here? for God’s sake, my lord, let</a>
<a id='line_7623'>me wit how I came here. Sir, said Dame Elaine, into this country ye</a>
<a id='line_7624'>came like a madman, clean out of your wit, and here have ye been kept</a>
<a id='line_7625'>as a fool; and no creature here knew what ye were, until by fortune a</a>
<a id='line_7626'>maiden of mine brought me unto you whereas ye lay sleeping by a well,</a>
<a id='line_7627'>and anon as I verily beheld you I knew you. And then I told my father,</a>
<a id='line_7628'>and so were ye brought afore this holy vessel, and by the virtue of it</a>
<a id='line_7629'>thus were ye healed. O Jesu, mercy, said Sir Launcelot; if this be</a>
<a id='line_7630'>sooth, how many there be that know of my woodness! So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_7631'>Elaine, no more but my father, and I, and Dame Brisen. Now for Christ’s</a>
<a id='line_7632'>love, said Sir Launcelot, keep it in counsel, and let no man know it in</a>
<a id='line_7633'>the world, for I am sore ashamed that I have been thus miscarried; for</a>
<a id='line_7634'>I am banished out of the country of Logris for ever, that is for to say</a>
<a id='line_7635'>the country of England.</a>
<a id='line_7636'></a>
<a id='line_7637'>And so Sir Launcelot lay more than a fortnight or ever that he might</a>
<a id='line_7638'>stir for soreness. And then upon a day he said unto Dame Elaine these</a>
<a id='line_7639'>words: Lady Elaine, for your sake I have had much travail, care, and</a>
<a id='line_7640'>anguish, it needeth not to rehearse it, ye know how. Notwithstanding I</a>
<a id='line_7641'>know well I have done foul to you when that I drew my sword to you, to</a>
<a id='line_7642'>have slain you, upon the morn when I had lain with you. And all was the</a>
<a id='line_7643'>cause, that ye and Dame Brisen made me for to lie by you maugre mine</a>
<a id='line_7644'>head; and as ye say, that night Galahad your son was begotten. That is</a>
<a id='line_7645'>truth, said Dame Elaine. Now will ye for my love, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_7646'>go unto your father and get me a place of him wherein I may dwell? for</a>
<a id='line_7647'>in the court of King Arthur may I never come. Sir, said Dame Elaine, I</a>
<a id='line_7648'>will live and die with you, and only for your sake; and if my life</a>
<a id='line_7649'>might not avail you and my death might avail you, wit you well I would</a>
<a id='line_7650'>die for your sake. And I will go to my father and I am sure there is</a>
<a id='line_7651'>nothing that I can desire of him but I shall have it. And where ye be,</a>
<a id='line_7652'>my lord Sir Launcelot, doubt ye not but I will be with you with all the</a>
<a id='line_7653'>service that I may do. So forthwithal she went to her father and said,</a>
<a id='line_7654'>Sir, my lord, Sir Launcelot, desireth to be here by you in some castle</a>
<a id='line_7655'>of yours. Well daughter, said the king, sith it is his desire to abide</a>
<a id='line_7656'>in these marches he shall be in the Castle of Bliant, and there shall</a>
<a id='line_7657'>ye be with him, and twenty of the fairest ladies that be in the</a>
<a id='line_7658'>country, and they shall all be of the great blood, and ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_7659'>ten knights with you; for, daughter, I will that ye wit we all be</a>
<a id='line_7660'>honoured by the blood of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7661'></a>
<a id='line_7662'></a>
<a id='line_7663'></a>
<a id='line_7664'></a>
<a id='line_7665'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot came into the joyous Isle, and there he</a>
<a id='line_7666'>named himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet.</a>
<a id='line_7667'></a>
<a id='line_7668'></a>
<a id='line_7669'>Then went Dame Elaine unto Sir Launcelot, and told him all how her</a>
<a id='line_7670'>father had devised for him and her. Then came the knight Sir Castor,</a>
<a id='line_7671'>that was nephew unto King Pelles, unto Sir Launcelot, and asked him</a>
<a id='line_7672'>what was his name. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, my name is Le Chevaler Mal</a>
<a id='line_7673'>Fet, that is to say the knight that hath trespassed. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7674'>Castor, it may well be so, but ever meseemeth your name should be Sir</a>
<a id='line_7675'>Launcelot du Lake, for or now I have seen you. Sir, said Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_7676'>are not as a gentle knight: I put case my name were Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_7677'>that it list me not to discover my name, what should it grieve you here</a>
<a id='line_7678'>to keep my counsel, and ye be not hurt thereby? but wit thou well an</a>
<a id='line_7679'>ever it lie in my power I shall grieve you, and that I promise you</a>
<a id='line_7680'>truly. Then Sir Castor kneeled down and besought Sir Launcelot of</a>
<a id='line_7681'>mercy: For I shall never utter what ye be, while that ye be in these</a>
<a id='line_7682'>parts. Then Sir Launcelot pardoned him.</a>
<a id='line_7683'></a>
<a id='line_7684'>And then, after this, King Pelles with ten knights, and Dame Elaine,</a>
<a id='line_7685'>and twenty ladies, rode unto the Castle of Bliant that stood in an</a>
<a id='line_7686'>island beclosed in iron, with a fair water deep and large. And when</a>
<a id='line_7687'>they were there Sir Launcelot let call it the Joyous Isle; and there</a>
<a id='line_7688'>was he called none otherwise but Le Chevaler Mal Fet, the knight that</a>
<a id='line_7689'>hath trespassed. Then Sir Launcelot let make him a shield all of sable,</a>
<a id='line_7690'>and a queen crowned in the midst, all of silver, and a knight clean</a>
<a id='line_7691'>armed kneeling afore her. And every day once, for any mirths that all</a>
<a id='line_7692'>the ladies might make him, he would once every day look toward the</a>
<a id='line_7693'>realm of Logris, where King Arthur and Queen Guenever was. And then</a>
<a id='line_7694'>would he fall upon a weeping as his heart should to-brast.</a>
<a id='line_7695'></a>
<a id='line_7696'>So it fell that time Sir Launcelot heard of a jousting fast by his</a>
<a id='line_7697'>castle, within three leagues. Then he called unto him a dwarf, and he</a>
<a id='line_7698'>bade him go unto that jousting. And or ever the knights depart, look</a>
<a id='line_7699'>thou make there a cry, in hearing of all the knights, that there is one</a>
<a id='line_7700'>knight in the Joyous Isle, that is the Castle of Bliant, and say his</a>
<a id='line_7701'>name is Le Chevaler Mal Fet, that will joust against knights that will</a>
<a id='line_7702'>come. And who that putteth that knight to the worse shall have a fair</a>
<a id='line_7703'>maid and a gerfalcon.</a>
<a id='line_7704'></a>
<a id='line_7705'></a>
<a id='line_7706'></a>
<a id='line_7707'></a>
<a id='line_7708'>CHAPTER VII. Of a great tourneying in the Joyous Isle, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_7709'>Pervivale and Sir Ector came thither, and Sir Percivale fought with</a>
<a id='line_7710'>him.</a>
<a id='line_7711'></a>
<a id='line_7712'></a>
<a id='line_7713'>So when this cry was made, unto Joyous Isle drew knights to the number</a>
<a id='line_7714'>of five hundred; and wit ye well there was never seen in Arthur’s days</a>
<a id='line_7715'>one knight that did so much deeds of arms as Sir Launcelot did three</a>
<a id='line_7716'>days together; for as the book maketh truly mention, he had the better</a>
<a id='line_7717'>of all the five hundred knights, and there was not one slain of them.</a>
<a id='line_7718'>And after that Sir Launcelot made them all a great feast.</a>
<a id='line_7719'></a>
<a id='line_7720'>And in the meanwhile came Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Ector de Maris</a>
<a id='line_7721'>under that castle that was called the Joyous Isle. And as they beheld</a>
<a id='line_7722'>that gay castle they would have gone to that castle, but they might not</a>
<a id='line_7723'>for the broad water, and bridge could they find none. Then they saw on</a>
<a id='line_7724'>the other side a lady with a sperhawk on her hand, and Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_7725'>called unto her, and asked that lady who was in that castle. Fair</a>
<a id='line_7726'>knights, she said, here within this castle is the fairest lady in this</a>
<a id='line_7727'>land, and her name is Elaine. Also we have in this castle the fairest</a>
<a id='line_7728'>knight and the mightiest man that is I dare say living, and he called</a>
<a id='line_7729'>himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet. How came he into these marches? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7730'>Percivale. Truly, said the damosel, he came into this country like a</a>
<a id='line_7731'>mad man, with dogs and boys chasing him through the city of Corbin, and</a>
<a id='line_7732'>by the holy vessel of the Sangreal he was brought into his wit again;</a>
<a id='line_7733'>but he will not do battle with no knight, but by underne or by noon.</a>
<a id='line_7734'>And if ye list to come into the castle, said the lady, ye must ride</a>
<a id='line_7735'>unto the further side of the castle and there shall ye find a vessel</a>
<a id='line_7736'>that will bear you and your horse. Then they departed, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_7737'>the vessel. And then Sir Percivale alighted, and said to Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_7738'>Maris: Ye shall abide me here until that I wit what manner a knight he</a>
<a id='line_7739'>is; for it were shame unto us, inasmuch as he is but one knight, an we</a>
<a id='line_7740'>should both do battle with him. Do ye as ye list, said Sir Ector, and</a>
<a id='line_7741'>here I shall abide you until that I hear of you.</a>
<a id='line_7742'></a>
<a id='line_7743'>Then passed Sir Percivale the water, and when he came to the castle</a>
<a id='line_7744'>gate he bade the porter: Go thou to the good knight within the castle,</a>
<a id='line_7745'>and tell him here is come an errant knight to joust with him. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_7746'>the porter, ride ye within the castle, and there is a common place for</a>
<a id='line_7747'>jousting, that lords and ladies may behold you. So anon as Sir</a>
<a id='line_7748'>Launcelot had warning he was soon ready; and there Sir Percivale and</a>
<a id='line_7749'>Sir Launcelot encountered with such a might, and their spears were so</a>
<a id='line_7750'>rude, that both the horses and the knights fell to the earth. Then they</a>
<a id='line_7751'>avoided their horses, and flang out noble swords, and hewed away</a>
<a id='line_7752'>cantels of their shields, and hurtled together with their shields like</a>
<a id='line_7753'>two boars, and either wounded other passing sore. At the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_7754'>Percivale spake first when they had foughten there more than two hours.</a>
<a id='line_7755'>Fair knight, said Sir Percivale, I require thee tell me thy name, for I</a>
<a id='line_7756'>met never with such a knight. Sir, said Sir Launcelot, my name is Le</a>
<a id='line_7757'>Chevaler Mal Fet. Now tell me your name, said Sir Launcelot, I require</a>
<a id='line_7758'>you, gentle knight. Truly, said Sir Percivale, my name is Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_7759'>de Galis, that was brother unto the good knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis,</a>
<a id='line_7760'>and King Pellinore was our father, and Sir Aglovale is my brother.</a>
<a id='line_7761'>Alas, said Sir Launcelot, what have I done to fight with you that art a</a>
<a id='line_7762'>knight of the Round Table, that sometime was your fellow?</a>
<a id='line_7763'></a>

<a id='line_7767'>CHAPTER VIlI. How each of them knew other, and of their great courtesy,</a>
<a id='line_7768'>and how his brother Sir Ector came unto him, and of their joy.</a>
<a id='line_7769'></a>
<a id='line_7770'></a>
<a id='line_7771'>And therewithal Sir Launcelot kneeled down upon his knees, and threw</a>
<a id='line_7772'>away his shield and his sword from him. When Sir Percivale saw him do</a>
<a id='line_7773'>so he marvelled what he meant. And then thus he said: Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_7774'>whatsomever thou be, I require thee upon the high order of knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_7775'>tell me thy true name. Then he said: So God me help, my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_7776'>Launcelot du Lake, King Ban’s son of Benoy. Alas, said Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_7777'>what have I done? I was sent by the queen for to seek you, and so I</a>
<a id='line_7778'>have sought you nigh this two year, and yonder is Sir Ector de Maris,</a>
<a id='line_7779'>your brother abideth me on the other side of the yonder water. Now for</a>
<a id='line_7780'>God’s sake, said Sir Percivale, forgive me mine offences that I have</a>
<a id='line_7781'>here done. It is soon forgiven, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7782'></a>
<a id='line_7783'>Then Sir Percivale sent for Sir Ector de Maris, and when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7784'>had a sight of him, he ran unto him and took him in his arms; and then</a>
<a id='line_7785'>Sir Ector kneeled down, and either wept upon other, that all had pity</a>
<a id='line_7786'>to behold them. Then came Dame Elaine and she there made them great</a>
<a id='line_7787'>cheer as might lie in her power; and there she told Sir Ector and Sir</a>
<a id='line_7788'>Percivale how and in what manner Sir Launcelot came into that country,</a>
<a id='line_7789'>and how he was healed; and there it was known how long Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_7790'>was with Sir Bliant and with Sir Selivant, and how he first met with</a>
<a id='line_7791'>them, and how he departed from them because of a boar; and how the</a>
<a id='line_7792'>hermit healed Sir Launcelot of his great wound, and how that he came to</a>
<a id='line_7793'>Corbin.</a>

<a id='line_7798'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Bors and Sir Lionel came to King Brandegore, and</a>
<a id='line_7799'>how Sir Bors took his son Helin le Blank, and of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_7800'></a>
<a id='line_7801'></a>
<a id='line_7802'>Now leave we Sir Launcelot in the Joyous Isle with the Lady Dame</a>
<a id='line_7803'>Elaine, and Sir Percivale and Sir Ector playing with them, and turn we</a>
<a id='line_7804'>to Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Lionel, that had sought Sir Launcelot nigh</a>
<a id='line_7805'>by the space of two year, and never could they hear of him. And as they</a>
<a id='line_7806'>thus rode, by adventure they came to the house of Brandegore, and there</a>
<a id='line_7807'>Sir Bors was well known, for he had gotten a child upon the king’s</a>
<a id='line_7808'>daughter fifteen year to-fore, and his name was Helin le Blank. And</a>
<a id='line_7809'>when Sir Bors saw that child it liked him passing well. And so those</a>
<a id='line_7810'>knights had good cheer of the King Brandegore. And on the morn Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_7811'>came afore King Brandegore and said: Here is my son Helin le Blank,</a>
<a id='line_7812'>that as it is said he is my son; and sith it is so, I will that ye wit</a>
<a id='line_7813'>that I will have him with me unto the court of King Arthur. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_7814'>the king, ye may well take him with you, but he is over tender of age.</a>
<a id='line_7815'>As for that, said Sir Bors, I will have him with me, and bring him to</a>
<a id='line_7816'>the house of most worship of the world. So when Sir Bors should depart</a>
<a id='line_7817'>there was made great sorrow for the departing of Helin le Blank, and</a>
<a id='line_7818'>great weeping was there made. But Sir Bors and Sir Lionel departed, and</a>
<a id='line_7819'>within a while they came to Camelot, where was King Arthur. And when</a>
<a id='line_7820'>King Arthur understood that Helin le Blank was Sir Bors’ son, and</a>
<a id='line_7821'>nephew unto King Brandegore, then King Arthur let him make knight of</a>
<a id='line_7822'>the Round Table; and so he proved a good knight and an adventurous.</a>
<a id='line_7823'></a>
<a id='line_7824'>Now will we turn to our matter of Sir Launcelot. It befell upon a day</a>
<a id='line_7825'>Sir Ector and Sir Percivale came to Sir Launcelot and asked him what he</a>
<a id='line_7826'>would do, and whether he would go with them unto King Arthur or not.</a>
<a id='line_7827'>Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that may not be by no mean, for I was so</a>
<a id='line_7828'>entreated at the court that I cast me never to come there more. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_7829'>said Sir Ector, I am your brother, and ye are the man in the world that</a>
<a id='line_7830'>I love most; and if I understood that it were your disworship, ye may</a>
<a id='line_7831'>understand I would never counsel you thereto; but King Arthur and all</a>
<a id='line_7832'>his knights, and in especial Queen Guenever, made such dole and sorrow</a>
<a id='line_7833'>that it was marvel to hear and see. And ye must remember the great</a>
<a id='line_7834'>worship and renown that ye be of, how that ye have been more spoken of</a>
<a id='line_7835'>than any other knight that is now living; for there is none that</a>
<a id='line_7836'>beareth the name now but ye and Sir Tristram. Therefore brother, said</a>
<a id='line_7837'>Sir Ector, make you ready to ride to the court with us, and I dare say</a>
<a id='line_7838'>there was never knight better welcome to the court than ye; and I wot</a>
<a id='line_7839'>well and can make it good, said Sir Ector, it hath cost my lady, the</a>
<a id='line_7840'>queen, twenty thousand pound the seeking of you. Well brother, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7841'>Launcelot, I will do after your counsel, and ride with you.</a>
<a id='line_7842'></a>
<a id='line_7843'>So then they took their horses and made them ready, and took their</a>
<a id='line_7844'>leave at King Pelles and at Dame Elaine. And when Sir Launcelot should</a>
<a id='line_7845'>depart Dame Elaine made great sorrow. My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Dame</a>
<a id='line_7846'>Elaine, at this same feast of Pentecost shall your son and mine,</a>
<a id='line_7847'>Galahad, be made knight, for he is fully now fifteen winter old. Do as</a>
<a id='line_7848'>ye list, said Sir Launcelot; God give him grace to prove a good knight.</a>
<a id='line_7849'>As for that, said Dame Elaine, I doubt not he shall prove the best man</a>
<a id='line_7850'>of his kin except one. Then shall he be a man good enough, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7851'>Launcelot.</a>

<a id='line_7856'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot with Sir Percivale and Sir Ector came to</a>
<a id='line_7857'>the court, and of the great joy of him.</a>
<a id='line_7858'></a>
<a id='line_7859'></a>
<a id='line_7860'>Then they departed, and within five days’ journey they came to Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_7861'>that is called in English, Winchester. And when Sir Launcelot was come</a>
<a id='line_7862'>among them, the king and all the knights made great joy of him. And</a>
<a id='line_7863'>there Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Ector de Maris began and told the</a>
<a id='line_7864'>whole adventures: that Sir Launcelot had been out of his mind the time</a>
<a id='line_7865'>of his absence, and how he called himself Le Chevaler Mal Fet, the</a>
<a id='line_7866'>knight that had trespassed; and in three days Sir Launcelot smote down</a>
<a id='line_7867'>five hundred knights. And ever as Sir Ector and Sir Percivale told</a>
<a id='line_7868'>these tales of Sir Launcelot, Queen Guenever wept as she should have</a>
<a id='line_7869'>died. Then the queen made great cheer. O Jesu, said King Arthur, I</a>
<a id='line_7870'>marvel for what cause ye, Sir Launcelot, went out of your mind. I and</a>
<a id='line_7871'>many others deem it was for the love of fair Elaine, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_7872'>King Pelles, by whom ye are noised that ye have gotten a child, and his</a>
<a id='line_7873'>name is Galahad, and men say he shall do marvels. My lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7874'>Launcelot, if I did any folly I have that I sought. And therewithal the</a>
<a id='line_7875'>king spake no more. But all Sir Launcelot’s kin knew for whom he went</a>
<a id='line_7876'>out of his mind. And then there were great feasts made and great joy;</a>
<a id='line_7877'>and many great lords and ladies, when they heard that Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_7878'>come to the court again, they made great joy.</a>
<a id='line_7879'></a>
<a id='line_7880'></a>

<a id='line_7882'></a>
<a id='line_7883'>CHAPTER XI. How La Beale Isoud counselled Sir Tristram to go unto the</a>
<a id='line_7884'>court, to the great feast of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_7885'></a>
<a id='line_7886'></a>
<a id='line_7887'>Now will we leave off this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram, and of</a>
<a id='line_7888'>Sir Palomides that was the Saracen unchristened. When Sir Tristram was</a>
<a id='line_7889'>come home unto Joyous Gard from his adventures, all this while that Sir</a>
<a id='line_7890'>Launcelot was thus missed, two year and more, Sir Tristram bare the</a>
<a id='line_7891'>renown through all the realm of Logris, and many strange adventures</a>
<a id='line_7892'>befell him, and full well and manly and worshipfully he brought them to</a>
<a id='line_7893'>an end. So when he was come home La Beale Isoud told him of the great</a>
<a id='line_7894'>feast that should be at Pentecost next following, and there she told</a>
<a id='line_7895'>him how Sir Launcelot had been missed two year, and all that while he</a>
<a id='line_7896'>had been out of his mind, and how he was holpen by the holy vessel, the</a>
<a id='line_7897'>Sangreal. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that caused some debate betwixt him</a>
<a id='line_7898'>and Queen Guenever. Sir, said Dame Isoud, I know it all, for Queen</a>
<a id='line_7899'>Guenever sent me a letter in the which she wrote me all how it was, for</a>
<a id='line_7900'>to require you to seek him. And now, blessed be God, said La Beale</a>
<a id='line_7901'>Isoud, he is whole and sound and come again to the court.</a>
<a id='line_7902'></a>
<a id='line_7903'>Thereof am I glad, said Sir Tristram, and now shall ye and I make us</a>
<a id='line_7904'>ready, for both ye and I will be at the feast. Sir, said Isoud, an it</a>
<a id='line_7905'>please you I will not be there, for through me ye be marked of many</a>
<a id='line_7906'>good knights, and that caused you to have much more labour for my sake</a>
<a id='line_7907'>than needeth you. Then will I not be there, said Sir Tristram, but if</a>
<a id='line_7908'>ye be there. God defend, said La Beale Isoud, for then shall I be</a>
<a id='line_7909'>spoken of shame among all queens and ladies of estate; for ye that are</a>
<a id='line_7910'>called one of the noblest knights of the world, and ye a knight of the</a>
<a id='line_7911'>Round Table, how may ye be missed at that feast? What shall be said</a>
<a id='line_7912'>among all knights? See how Sir Tristram hunteth, and hawketh, and</a>
<a id='line_7913'>cowereth within a castle with his lady, and forsaketh your worship.</a>
<a id='line_7914'>Alas, shall some say, it is pity that ever he was made knight, or that</a>
<a id='line_7915'>ever he should have the love of a lady. Also what shall queens and</a>
<a id='line_7916'>ladies say of me? It is pity that I have my life, that I will hold so</a>
<a id='line_7917'>noble a knight as ye are from his worship. So God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7918'>Tristram unto La Beale Isoud, it is passing well said of you and nobly</a>
<a id='line_7919'>counselled; and now I well understand that ye love me; and like as ye</a>
<a id='line_7920'>have counselled me I will do a part thereafter. But there shall no man</a>
<a id='line_7921'>nor child ride with me, but myself. And so will I ride on Tuesday next</a>
<a id='line_7922'>coming, and no more harness of war but my spear and my sword.</a>
<a id='line_7923'></a>
<a id='line_7924'></a>
<a id='line_7925'></a>
<a id='line_7926'></a>
<a id='line_7927'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Tristram departed unarmed and met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_7928'>Palomides, and how they smote each other, and how Sir Palomides forbare</a>
<a id='line_7929'>him.</a>
<a id='line_7930'></a>
<a id='line_7931'></a>
<a id='line_7932'>And so when the day came Sir Tristram took his leave at La Beale Isoud,</a>
<a id='line_7933'>and she sent with him four knights, and within half a mile he sent them</a>
<a id='line_7934'>again: and within a mile after Sir Tristram saw afore him where Sir</a>
<a id='line_7935'>Palomides had stricken down a knight, and almost wounded him to the</a>
<a id='line_7936'>death. Then Sir Tristram repented him that he was not armed, and then</a>
<a id='line_7937'>he hoved still. With that Sir Palomides knew Sir Tristram, and cried on</a>
<a id='line_7938'>high: Sir Tristram, now be we met, for or we depart we will redress our</a>
<a id='line_7939'>old sores. As for that, said Sir Tristram, there was yet never</a>
<a id='line_7940'>Christian man might make his boast that ever I fled from him; and wit</a>
<a id='line_7941'>ye well, Sir Palomides, thou that art a Saracen shall never make thy</a>
<a id='line_7942'>boast that Sir Tristram de Liones shall flee from thee. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_7943'>Sir Tristram made his horse to run, and with all his might he came</a>
<a id='line_7944'>straight upon Sir Palomides, and brast his spear upon him an hundred</a>
<a id='line_7945'>pieces. And forthwithal Sir Tristram drew his sword. And then he turned</a>
<a id='line_7946'>his horse and struck at Palomides six great strokes upon his helm; and</a>
<a id='line_7947'>then Sir Palomides stood still, and beheld Sir Tristram, and marvelled</a>
<a id='line_7948'>of his woodness, and of his folly. And then Sir Palomides said to</a>
<a id='line_7949'>himself: An Sir Tristram were armed, it were hard to cease him of this</a>
<a id='line_7950'>battle, and if I turn again and slay him I am ashamed wheresomever that</a>
<a id='line_7951'>I go.</a>
<a id='line_7952'></a>
<a id='line_7953'>Then Sir Tristram spake and said: Thou coward knight, what castest thou</a>
<a id='line_7954'>to do; why wilt thou not do battle with me? for have thou no doubt I</a>
<a id='line_7955'>shall endure all thy malice. Ah, Sir Tristram, said Palomides, full</a>
<a id='line_7956'>well thou wottest I may not fight with thee for shame, for thou art</a>
<a id='line_7957'>here naked and I am armed, and if I slay thee, dishonour shall be mine.</a>
<a id='line_7958'>And well thou wottest, said Sir Palomides to Sir Tristram, I know thy</a>
<a id='line_7959'>strength and thy hardiness to endure against a good knight. That is</a>
<a id='line_7960'>truth, said Sir Tristram, I understand thy valiantness well. Ye say</a>
<a id='line_7961'>well, said Sir Palomides; now, I require you, tell me a question that I</a>
<a id='line_7962'>shall say to you. Tell me what it is, said Sir Tristram, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_7963'>answer you the truth, as God me help. I put case, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_7964'>that ye were armed at all rights as well as I am, and I naked as ye be,</a>
<a id='line_7965'>what would you do to me now, by your true knighthood? Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_7966'>Tristram, now I understand thee well, Sir Palomides, for now must I say</a>
<a id='line_7967'>mine own judgment, and as God me bless, that I shall say shall not be</a>
<a id='line_7968'>said for no fear that I have of thee. But this is all: wit Sir</a>
<a id='line_7969'>Palomides, as at this time thou shouldest depart from me, for I would</a>
<a id='line_7970'>not have ado with thee. No more will I, said Palomides, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_7971'>ride forth on thy way. As for that I may choose, said Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_7972'>either to ride or to abide. But Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I</a>
<a id='line_7973'>marvel of one thing, that thou that art so good a knight, that thou</a>
<a id='line_7974'>wilt not be christened, and thy brother, Sir Safere, hath been</a>
<a id='line_7975'>christened many a day.</a>
<a id='line_7976'></a>
<a id='line_7977'></a>
<a id='line_7978'></a>
<a id='line_7979'></a>
<a id='line_7980'>CHAPTER XIII. How that Sir Tristram gat him harness of a knight which</a>
<a id='line_7981'>was hurt, and how he overthrew Sir Palomides.</a>
<a id='line_7982'></a>
<a id='line_7983'></a>
<a id='line_7984'>As for that, said Sir Palomides, I may not yet be christened for one</a>
<a id='line_7985'>avow that I have made many years agone; howbeit in my heart I believe</a>
<a id='line_7986'>in Jesu Christ and his mild mother Mary; but I have but one battle to</a>
<a id='line_7987'>do, and when that is done I will be baptised with a good will. By my</a>
<a id='line_7988'>head, said Tristram, as for one battle thou shalt not seek it no</a>
<a id='line_7989'>longer. For God defend, said Sir Tristram, that through my default thou</a>
<a id='line_7990'>shouldst longer live thus a Saracen, for yonder is a knight that ye,</a>
<a id='line_7991'>Sir Palomides, have hurt and smitten down. Now help me that I were</a>
<a id='line_7992'>armed in his armour, and I shall soon fulfil thine avows. As ye will,</a>
<a id='line_7993'>said Palomides, so it shall be.</a>
<a id='line_7994'></a>
<a id='line_7995'>So they rode both unto that knight that sat upon a bank, and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_7996'>Tristram saluted him, and he weakly saluted him again. Sir knight, said</a>
<a id='line_7997'>Sir Tristram, I require you tell me your right name. Sir, he said, my</a>
<a id='line_7998'>name is Sir Galleron of Galway, and knight of the Table Round. So God</a>
<a id='line_7999'>me help, said Sir Tristram, I am right heavy of your hurts; but this is</a>
<a id='line_8000'>all, I must pray you to lend me all your whole armour, for ye see I am</a>
<a id='line_8001'>unarmed, and I must do battle with this knight. Sir, said the hurt</a>
<a id='line_8002'>knight, ye shall have it with a good will; but ye must beware, for I</a>
<a id='line_8003'>warn you that knight is wight. Sir, said Galleron, I pray you tell me</a>
<a id='line_8004'>your name, and what is that knight’s name that hath beaten me. Sir, as</a>
<a id='line_8005'>for my name it is Sir Tristram de Liones, and as for the knight’s name</a>
<a id='line_8006'>that hath hurt you is Sir Palomides, brother to the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_8007'>Safere, and yet is Sir Palomides unchristened. Alas, said Sir Galleron,</a>
<a id='line_8008'>that is pity that so good a knight and so noble a man of arms should be</a>
<a id='line_8009'>unchristened. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, either he shall slay</a>
<a id='line_8010'>me or I him but that he shall be christened or ever we depart</a>
<a id='line_8011'>in-sunder. My lord Sir Tristram, said Sir Galleron, your renown and</a>
<a id='line_8012'>worship is well known through many realms, and God save you this day</a>
<a id='line_8013'>from shenship and shame.</a>
<a id='line_8014'></a>
<a id='line_8015'>Then Sir Tristram unarmed Galleron, the which was a noble knight, and</a>
<a id='line_8016'>had done many deeds of arms, and he was a large knight of flesh and</a>
<a id='line_8017'>bone. And when he was unarmed he stood upon his feet, for he was</a>
<a id='line_8018'>bruised in the back with a spear; yet so as Sir Galleron might, he</a>
<a id='line_8019'>armed Sir Tristram. And then Sir Tristram mounted upon his own horse,</a>
<a id='line_8020'>and in his hand he gat Sir Galleron’s spear; and therewithal Sir</a>
<a id='line_8021'>Palomides was ready. And so they came hurtling together, and either</a>
<a id='line_8022'>smote other in midst of their shields; and therewithal Sir Palomides’</a>
<a id='line_8023'>spear brake, and Sir Tristram smote down the horse; and Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_8024'>as soon as he might, avoided his horse, and dressed his shield, and</a>
<a id='line_8025'>pulled out his sword. That saw Sir Tristram, and therewithal he</a>
<a id='line_8026'>alighted and tied his horse till a tree.</a>
<a id='line_8027'></a>
<a id='line_8028'></a>

<a id='line_8030'></a>
<a id='line_8031'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides fought long together,</a>
<a id='line_8032'>and after accorded, and how Sir Tristram made him to be christened.</a>
<a id='line_8033'></a>
<a id='line_8034'></a>
<a id='line_8035'>And then they came together as two wild boars, lashing together,</a>
<a id='line_8036'>tracing and traversing as noble men that oft had been well proved in</a>
<a id='line_8037'>battle; but ever Sir Palomides dread the might of Sir Tristram, and</a>
<a id='line_8038'>therefore he suffered him to breathe him. Thus they fought more than</a>
<a id='line_8039'>two hours, but often Sir Tristram smote such strokes at Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_8040'>that he made him to kneel; and Sir Palomides brake and cut away many</a>
<a id='line_8041'>pieces of Sir Tristram’s shield; and then Sir Palomides wounded Sir</a>
<a id='line_8042'>Tristram, for he was a well fighting man. Then Sir Tristram was wood</a>
<a id='line_8043'>wroth out of measure, and rushed upon Sir Palomides with such a might</a>
<a id='line_8044'>that Sir Palomides fell grovelling to the earth; and therewithal he</a>
<a id='line_8045'>leapt up lightly upon his feet, and then Sir Tristram wounded Palomides</a>
<a id='line_8046'>sore through the shoulder. And ever Sir Tristram fought still in like</a>
<a id='line_8047'>hard, and Sir Palomides failed not, but gave him many sad strokes. And</a>
<a id='line_8048'>at the last Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and by fortune Sir</a>
<a id='line_8049'>Tristram smote Sir Palomides sword out of his hand, and if Sir</a>
<a id='line_8050'>Palomides had stooped for his sword he had been slain.</a>
<a id='line_8051'></a>
<a id='line_8052'>Then Palomides stood still and beheld his sword with a sorrowful heart.</a>
<a id='line_8053'>How now, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides, now have I thee at advantage</a>
<a id='line_8054'>as thou haddest me this day; but it shall never be said in no court,</a>
<a id='line_8055'>nor among good knights, that Sir Tristram shall slay any knight that is</a>
<a id='line_8056'>weaponless; and therefore take thou thy sword, and let us make an end</a>
<a id='line_8057'>of this battle. As for to do this battle, said Palomides, I dare right</a>
<a id='line_8058'>well end it, but I have no great lust to fight no more. And for this</a>
<a id='line_8059'>cause, said Palomides: mine offence to you is not so great but that we</a>
<a id='line_8060'>may be friends. All that I have offended is and was for the love of La</a>
<a id='line_8061'>Beale Isoud. And as for her, I dare say she is peerless above all other</a>
<a id='line_8062'>ladies, and also I proffered her never no dishonour; and by her I have</a>
<a id='line_8063'>gotten the most part of my worship. And sithen I offended never as to</a>
<a id='line_8064'>her own person, and as for the offence that I have done, it was against</a>
<a id='line_8065'>your own person, and for that offence ye have given me this day many</a>
<a id='line_8066'>sad strokes, and some I have given you again; and now I dare say I felt</a>
<a id='line_8067'>never man of your might, nor so well breathed, but if it were Sir</a>
<a id='line_8068'>Launcelot du Lake; wherefore I require you, my lord, forgive me all</a>
<a id='line_8069'>that I have offended unto you; and this same day have me to the next</a>
<a id='line_8070'>church, and first let me be clean confessed, and after see you now that</a>
<a id='line_8071'>I be truly baptised. And then will we all ride together unto the court</a>
<a id='line_8072'>of Arthur, that we be there at the high feast. Now take your horse,</a>
<a id='line_8073'>said Sir Tristram, and as ye say so it shall be, and all thine evil</a>
<a id='line_8074'>will God forgive it you, and I do. And here within this mile is the</a>
<a id='line_8075'>Suffragan of Carlisle that shall give you the sacrament of baptism.</a>
<a id='line_8076'></a>
<a id='line_8077'>Then they took their horses and Sir Galleron rode with them. And when</a>
<a id='line_8078'>they came to the Suffragan Sir Tristram told him their desire. Then the</a>
<a id='line_8079'>Suffragan let fill a great vessel with water, and when he had hallowed</a>
<a id='line_8080'>it he then confessed clean Sir Palomides, and Sir Tristram and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8081'>Galleron were his godfathers. And then soon after they departed, riding</a>
<a id='line_8082'>toward Camelot, where King Arthur and Queen Guenever was, and for the</a>
<a id='line_8083'>most part all the knights of the Round Table. And so the king and all</a>
<a id='line_8084'>the court were glad that Sir Palomides was christened. And at the same</a>
<a id='line_8085'>feast in came Galahad and sat in the Siege Perilous. And so therewithal</a>
<a id='line_8086'>departed and dissevered all the knights of the Round Table. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_8087'>Tristram returned again unto Joyous Gard, and Sir Palomides followed</a>
<a id='line_8088'>the Questing Beast.</a>

<a id='line_8109'>hall before King Arthur a damosel, and desired Sir Launcelot for to</a>
<a id='line_8110'>come and dub a knight, and how he went with her.</a>
<a id='line_8111'></a>
<a id='line_8112'></a>
<a id='line_8113'>At the vigil of Pentecost, when all the fellowship of the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_8114'>were come unto Camelot and there heard their service, and the tables</a>
<a id='line_8115'>were set ready to the meat, right so entered into the hall a full fair</a>
<a id='line_8116'>gentlewoman on horseback, that had ridden full fast, for her horse was</a>
<a id='line_8117'>all besweated. Then she there alighted, and came before the king and</a>
<a id='line_8118'>saluted him; and he said: Damosel, God thee bless. Sir, said she, for</a>
<a id='line_8119'>God’s sake say me where Sir Launcelot is. Yonder ye may see him, said</a>
<a id='line_8120'>the king. Then she went unto Launcelot and said: Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_8121'>salute you on King Pelles’ behalf, and I require you come on with me</a>
<a id='line_8122'>hereby into a forest. Then Sir Launcelot asked her with whom she</a>
<a id='line_8123'>dwelled. I dwell, said she, with King Pelles. What will ye with me?</a>
<a id='line_8124'>said Launcelot. Ye shall know, said she, when ye come thither. Well,</a>
<a id='line_8125'>said he, I will gladly go with you. So Sir Launcelot bade his squire</a>
<a id='line_8126'>saddle his horse and bring his arms; and in all haste he did his</a>
<a id='line_8127'>commandment.</a>
<a id='line_8128'></a>
<a id='line_8129'>Then came the queen unto Launcelot, and said: Will ye leave us at this</a>
<a id='line_8130'>high feast? Madam, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well he shall be with</a>
<a id='line_8131'>you to-morn by dinner time. If I wist, said the queen, that he should</a>
<a id='line_8132'>not be with us here to-morn he should not go with you by my good will.</a>
<a id='line_8133'>Right so departed Sir Launcelot with the gentlewoman, and rode until</a>
<a id='line_8134'>that he came into a forest and into a great valley, where they saw an</a>
<a id='line_8135'>abbey of nuns; and there was a squire ready and opened the gates, and</a>
<a id='line_8136'>so they entered and descended off their horses; and there came a fair</a>
<a id='line_8137'>fellowship about Sir Launcelot, and welcomed him, and were passing glad</a>
<a id='line_8138'>of his coming. And then they led him unto the Abbess’s chamber and</a>
<a id='line_8139'>unarmed him; and right so he was ware upon a bed lying two of his</a>
<a id='line_8140'>cousins, Sir Bors and Sir Lionel, and then he waked them; and when they</a>
<a id='line_8141'>saw him they made great joy. Sir, said Sir Bors unto Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_8142'>what adventure hath brought you hither, for we weened to-morn to have</a>
<a id='line_8143'>found you at Camelot? As God me help, said Sir Launcelot, a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_8144'>brought me hither, but I know not the cause.</a>
<a id='line_8145'></a>
<a id='line_8146'>In the meanwhile that they thus stood talking together, therein came</a>
<a id='line_8147'>twelve nuns that brought with them Galahad, the which was passing fair</a>
<a id='line_8148'>and well made, that unnethe in the world men might not find his match:</a>
<a id='line_8149'>and all those ladies wept. Sir, said they all, we bring you here this</a>
<a id='line_8150'>child the which we have nourished, and we pray you to make him a</a>
<a id='line_8151'>knight, for of a more worthier man’s hand may he not receive the order</a>
<a id='line_8152'>of knighthood. Sir Launcelot beheld the young squire and saw him seemly</a>
<a id='line_8153'>and demure as a dove, with all manner of good features, that he weened</a>
<a id='line_8154'>of his age never to have seen so fair a man of form. Then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8155'>Launcelot: Cometh this desire of himself? He and all they said yea.</a>
<a id='line_8156'>Then shall he, said Sir Launcelot, receive the high order of knighthood</a>
<a id='line_8157'>as to-morn at the reverence of the high feast. That night Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_8158'>had passing good cheer; and on the morn at the hour of prime, at</a>
<a id='line_8159'>Galahad’s desire, he made him knight and said: God make him a good man,</a>
<a id='line_8160'>for of beauty faileth you not as any that liveth.</a>

<a id='line_8165'>CHAPTER II. How the letters were found written in the Siege Perilous</a>
<a id='line_8166'>and of the marvellous adventure of the sword in a stone.</a>
<a id='line_8167'></a>
<a id='line_8168'></a>
<a id='line_8169'>Now fair sir, said Sir Launcelot, will ye come with me unto the court</a>
<a id='line_8170'>of King Arthur? Nay, said he, I will not go with you as at this time.</a>
<a id='line_8171'>Then he departed from them and took his two cousins with him, and so</a>
<a id='line_8172'>they came unto Camelot by the hour of underne on Whitsunday. By that</a>
<a id='line_8173'>time the king and the queen were gone to the minster to hear their</a>
<a id='line_8174'>service. Then the king and the queen were passing glad of Sir Bors and</a>
<a id='line_8175'>Sir Lionel, and so was all the fellowship. So when the king and all the</a>
<a id='line_8176'>knights were come from service, the barons espied in the sieges of the</a>
<a id='line_8177'>Round Table all about, written with golden letters: Here ought to sit</a>
<a id='line_8178'>he, and he ought to sit here. And thus they went so long till that they</a>
<a id='line_8179'>came to the Siege Perilous, where they found letters newly written of</a>
<a id='line_8180'>gold which said: Four hundred winters and four and fifty accomplished</a>
<a id='line_8181'>after the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ ought this siege to be</a>
<a id='line_8182'>fulfilled. Then all they said: This is a marvellous thing and an</a>
<a id='line_8183'>adventurous. In the name of God, said Sir Launcelot; and then accompted</a>
<a id='line_8184'>the term of the writing from the birth of our Lord unto that day. It</a>
<a id='line_8185'>seemeth me said Sir Launcelot, this siege ought to be fulfilled this</a>
<a id='line_8186'>same day, for this is the feast of Pentecost after the four hundred and</a>
<a id='line_8187'>four and fifty year; and if it would please all parties, I would none</a>
<a id='line_8188'>of these letters were seen this day, till he be come that ought to</a>
<a id='line_8189'>enchieve this adventure. Then made they to ordain a cloth of silk, for</a>
<a id='line_8190'>to cover these letters in the Siege Perilous.</a>
<a id='line_8191'></a>
<a id='line_8192'>Then the king bade haste unto dinner. Sir, said Sir Kay the Steward, if</a>
<a id='line_8193'>ye go now unto your meat ye shall break your old custom of your court,</a>
<a id='line_8194'>for ye have not used on this day to sit at your meat or that ye have</a>
<a id='line_8195'>seen some adventure. Ye say sooth, said the king, but I had so great</a>
<a id='line_8196'>joy of Sir Launcelot and of his cousins, which be come to the court</a>
<a id='line_8197'>whole and sound, so that I bethought me not of mine old custom. So, as</a>
<a id='line_8198'>they stood speaking, in came a squire and said unto the king: Sir, I</a>
<a id='line_8199'>bring unto you marvellous tidings. What be they? said the king. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_8200'>there is here beneath at the river a great stone which I saw fleet</a>
<a id='line_8201'>above the water, and therein I saw sticking a sword. The king said: I</a>
<a id='line_8202'>will see that marvel. So all the knights went with him, and when they</a>
<a id='line_8203'>came to the river they found there a stone fleeting, as it were of red</a>
<a id='line_8204'>marble, and therein stuck a fair rich sword, and in the pommel thereof</a>
<a id='line_8205'>were precious stones wrought with subtle letters of gold. Then the</a>
<a id='line_8206'>barons read the letters which said in this wise: Never shall man take</a>
<a id='line_8207'>me hence, but only he by whose side I ought to hang, and he shall be</a>
<a id='line_8208'>the best knight of the world.</a>
<a id='line_8209'></a>
<a id='line_8210'>When the king had seen the letters, he said unto Sir Launcelot: Fair</a>
<a id='line_8211'>Sir, this sword ought to be yours, for I am sure ye be the best knight</a>
<a id='line_8212'>of the world. Then Sir Launcelot answered full soberly: Certes, sir, it</a>
<a id='line_8213'>is not my sword; also, Sir, wit ye well I have no hardiness to set my</a>
<a id='line_8214'>hand to it, for it longed not to hang by my side. Also, who that</a>
<a id='line_8215'>assayeth to take the sword and faileth of it, he shall receive a wound</a>
<a id='line_8216'>by that sword that he shall not be whole long after. And I will that ye</a>
<a id='line_8217'>wit that this same day shall the adventures of the Sangreal, that is</a>
<a id='line_8218'>called the Holy Vessel, begin.</a>
<a id='line_8219'></a>

<a id='line_8223'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Gawaine assayed to draw out the sword, and how an</a>
<a id='line_8224'>old man brought in Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_8225'></a>
<a id='line_8226'></a>
<a id='line_8227'>Now, fair nephew, said the king unto Sir Gawaine, assay ye, for my</a>
<a id='line_8228'>love. Sir, he said, save your good grace I shall not do that. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8229'>the king, assay to take the sword and at my commandment. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8230'>Gawaine, your commandment I will obey. And therewith he took up the</a>
<a id='line_8231'>sword by the handles, but he might not stir it. I thank you, said the</a>
<a id='line_8232'>king to Sir Gawaine. My lord Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, now wit</a>
<a id='line_8233'>ye well this sword shall touch you so sore that ye shall will ye had</a>
<a id='line_8234'>never set your hand thereto for the best castle of this realm. Sir, he</a>
<a id='line_8235'>said, I might not withsay mine uncle’s will and commandment. But when</a>
<a id='line_8236'>the king heard this he repented it much, and said unto Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_8237'>that he should assay, for his love. And he said: Gladly, for to bear</a>
<a id='line_8238'>Sir Gawaine fellowship. And therewith he set his hand on the sword and</a>
<a id='line_8239'>drew it strongly, but he might not move it. Then were there no more</a>
<a id='line_8240'>that durst be so hardy to set their hands thereto. Now may ye go to</a>
<a id='line_8241'>your dinner, said Sir Kay unto the king, for a marvellous adventure</a>
<a id='line_8242'>have ye seen. So the king and all went unto the court, and every knight</a>
<a id='line_8243'>knew his own place, and set him therein, and young men that were</a>
<a id='line_8244'>knights served them.</a>
<a id='line_8245'></a>
<a id='line_8246'>So when they were served, and all sieges fulfilled save only the Siege</a>
<a id='line_8247'>Perilous, anon there befell a marvellous adventure, that all the doors</a>
<a id='line_8248'>and windows of the palace shut by themself. Not for then the hall was</a>
<a id='line_8249'>not greatly darked; and therewith they were all abashed both one and</a>
<a id='line_8250'>other. Then King Arthur spake first and said: By God, fair fellows and</a>
<a id='line_8251'>lords, we have seen this day marvels, but or night I suppose we shall</a>
<a id='line_8252'>see greater marvels.</a>
<a id='line_8253'></a>
<a id='line_8254'>In the meanwhile came in a good old man, and an ancient, clothed all in</a>
<a id='line_8255'>white, and there was no knight knew from whence he came. And with him</a>
<a id='line_8256'>he brought a young knight, both on foot, in red arms, without sword or</a>
<a id='line_8257'>shield, save a scabbard hanging by his side. And these words he said:</a>
<a id='line_8258'>Peace be with you, fair lords. Then the old man said unto Arthur: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_8259'>I bring here a young knight, the which is of king’s lineage, and of the</a>
<a id='line_8260'>kindred of Joseph of Aramathie, whereby the marvels of this court, and</a>
<a id='line_8261'>of strange realms, shall be fully accomplished.</a>
<a id='line_8262'></a>

<a id='line_8266'>CHAPTER IV. How the old man brought Galahad to the Siege Perilous and</a>
<a id='line_8267'>set him therein, and how all the knights marvelled.</a>
<a id='line_8268'></a>
<a id='line_8269'></a>
<a id='line_8270'>The king was right glad of his words, and said unto the good man: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_8271'>ye be right welcome, and the young knight with you. Then the old man</a>
<a id='line_8272'>made the young man to unarm him, and he was in a coat of red sendal,</a>
<a id='line_8273'>and bare a mantle upon his shoulder that was furred with ermine, and</a>
<a id='line_8274'>put that upon him. And the old knight said unto the young knight: Sir,</a>
<a id='line_8275'>follow me. And anon he led him unto the Siege Perilous, where beside</a>
<a id='line_8276'>sat Sir Launcelot; and the good man lift up the cloth, and found there</a>
<a id='line_8277'>letters that said thus: This is the siege of Galahad, the haut prince.</a>
<a id='line_8278'>Sir, said the old knight, wit ye well that place is yours. And then he</a>
<a id='line_8279'>set him down surely in that siege. And then he said to the old man:</a>
<a id='line_8280'>Sir, ye may now go your way, for well have ye done that ye were</a>
<a id='line_8281'>commanded to do; and recommend me unto my grandsire, King Pelles, and</a>
<a id='line_8282'>unto my lord Petchere, and say them on my behalf, I shall come and see</a>
<a id='line_8283'>them as soon as ever I may. So the good man departed; and there met him</a>
<a id='line_8284'>twenty noble squires, and so took their horses and went their way.</a>
<a id='line_8285'></a>
<a id='line_8286'>Then all the knights of the Table Round marvelled greatly of Sir</a>
<a id='line_8287'>Galahad, that he durst sit there in that Siege Perilous, and was so</a>
<a id='line_8288'>tender of age; and wist not from whence he came but all only by God;</a>
<a id='line_8289'>and said: This is he by whom the Sangreal shall be enchieved, for there</a>
<a id='line_8290'>sat never none but he, but he were mischieved. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_8291'>beheld his son and had great joy of him. Then Bors told his fellows:</a>
<a id='line_8292'>Upon pain of my life this young knight shall come unto great worship.</a>
<a id='line_8293'>This noise was great in all the court, so that it came to the queen.</a>
<a id='line_8294'>Then she had marvel what knight it might be that durst adventure him to</a>
<a id='line_8295'>sit in the Siege Perilous. Many said unto the queen he resembled much</a>
<a id='line_8296'>unto Sir Launcelot. I may well suppose, said the queen, that Sir</a>
<a id='line_8297'>Launcelot begat him on King Pelles’ daughter, by the which he was made</a>
<a id='line_8298'>to lie by, by enchantment, and his name is Galahad. I would fain see</a>
<a id='line_8299'>him, said the queen, for he must needs be a noble man, for so is his</a>
<a id='line_8300'>father that him begat, I report me unto all the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_8301'></a>
<a id='line_8302'>So when the meat was done that the king and all were risen, the king</a>
<a id='line_8303'>yede unto the Siege Perilous and lift up the cloth, and found there the</a>
<a id='line_8304'>name of Galahad; and then he shewed it unto Sir Gawaine, and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_8305'>nephew, now have we among us Sir Galahad, the good knight that shall</a>
<a id='line_8306'>worship us all; and upon pain of my life he shall enchieve the</a>
<a id='line_8307'>Sangreal, right as Sir Launcelot had done us to understand. Then came</a>
<a id='line_8308'>King Arthur unto Galahad and said: Sir, ye be welcome, for ye shall</a>
<a id='line_8309'>move many good knights to the quest of the Sangreal, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_8310'>enchieve that never knights might bring to an end. Then the king took</a>
<a id='line_8311'>him by the hand, and went down from the palace to shew Galahad the</a>
<a id='line_8312'>adventures of the stone.</a>

<a id='line_8321'>The queen heard thereof, and came after with many ladies, and shewed</a>
<a id='line_8322'>them the stone where it hoved on the water. Sir, said the king unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_8323'>Galahad, here is a great marvel as ever I saw, and right good knights</a>
<a id='line_8324'>have assayed and failed. Sir, said Galahad, that is no marvel, for this</a>
<a id='line_8325'>adventure is not theirs but mine; and for the surety of this sword I</a>
<a id='line_8326'>brought none with me, for here by my side hangeth the scabbard. And</a>
<a id='line_8327'>anon he laid his hand on the sword, and lightly drew it out of the</a>
<a id='line_8328'>stone, and put it in the sheath, and said unto the king: Now it goeth</a>
<a id='line_8329'>better than it did aforehand. Sir, said the king, a shield God shall</a>
<a id='line_8330'>send you. Now have I that sword that sometime was the good knight’s,</a>
<a id='line_8331'>Balin le Savage, and he was a passing good man of his hands; and with</a>
<a id='line_8332'>this sword he slew his brother Balan, and that was great pity, for he</a>
<a id='line_8333'>was a good knight, and either slew other through a dolorous stroke that</a>
<a id='line_8334'>Balin gave unto my grandfather King Pelles, the which is not yet whole,</a>
<a id='line_8335'>nor not shall be till I heal him.</a>
<a id='line_8336'></a>
<a id='line_8337'>Therewith the king and all espied where came riding down the river a</a>
<a id='line_8338'>lady on a white palfrey toward them. Then she saluted the king and the</a>
<a id='line_8339'>queen, and asked if that Sir Launcelot was there. And then he answered</a>
<a id='line_8340'>himself: I am here, fair lady. Then she said all with weeping: How your</a>
<a id='line_8341'>great doing is changed sith this day in the morn. Damosel, why say you</a>
<a id='line_8342'>so? said Launcelot. I say you sooth, said the damosel, for ye were this</a>
<a id='line_8343'>day the best knight of the world, but who should say so now, he should</a>
<a id='line_8344'>be a liar, for there is now one better than ye, and well it is proved</a>
<a id='line_8345'>by the adventures of the sword whereto ye durst not set to your hand;</a>
<a id='line_8346'>and that is the change and leaving of your name. Wherefore I make unto</a>
<a id='line_8347'>you a remembrance, that ye shall not ween from henceforth that ye be</a>
<a id='line_8348'>the best knight of the world. As touching unto that, said Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_8349'>know well I was never the best. Yes, said the damosel, that were ye,</a>
<a id='line_8350'>and are yet, of any sinful man of the world. And, Sir king, Nacien, the</a>
<a id='line_8351'>hermit, sendeth thee word, that thee shall befall the greatest worship</a>
<a id='line_8352'>that ever befell king in Britain; and I say you wherefore, for this day</a>
<a id='line_8353'>the Sangreal appeared in thy house and fed thee and all thy fellowship</a>
<a id='line_8354'>of the Round Table. So she departed and went that same way that she</a>
<a id='line_8355'>came.</a>
<a id='line_8356'></a>
<a id='line_8357'></a>
<a id='line_8358'></a>
<a id='line_8359'></a>
<a id='line_8360'>CHAPTER VI. How King Arthur had all the knights together for to joust</a>
<a id='line_8361'>in the meadow beside Camelot or they departed.</a>
<a id='line_8362'></a>
<a id='line_8363'></a>
<a id='line_8364'>Now, said the king, I am sure at this quest of the Sangreal shall all</a>
<a id='line_8365'>ye of the Table Round depart, and never shall I see you again whole</a>
<a id='line_8366'>together; therefore I will see you all whole together in the meadow of</a>
<a id='line_8367'>Camelot to joust and to tourney, that after your death men may speak of</a>
<a id='line_8368'>it that such good knights were wholly together such a day. As unto that</a>
<a id='line_8369'>counsel and at the king’s request they accorded all, and took on their</a>
<a id='line_8370'>harness that longed unto jousting. But all this moving of the king was</a>
<a id='line_8371'>for this intent, for to see Galahad proved; for the king deemed he</a>
<a id='line_8372'>should not lightly come again unto the court after his departing. So</a>
<a id='line_8373'>were they assembled in the meadow, both more and less. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_8374'>Galahad, by the prayer of the king and the queen, did upon him a noble</a>
<a id='line_8375'>jesseraunce, and also he did on his helm, but shield would he take none</a>
<a id='line_8376'>for no prayer of the king. And then Sir Gawaine and other knights</a>
<a id='line_8377'>prayed him to take a spear. Right so he did; and the queen was in a</a>
<a id='line_8378'>tower with all her ladies, for to behold that tournament. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_8379'>Galahad dressed him in midst of the meadow, and began to break spears</a>
<a id='line_8380'>marvellously, that all men had wonder of him; for he there surmounted</a>
<a id='line_8381'>all other knights, for within a while he had defouled many good knights</a>
<a id='line_8382'>of the Table Round save twain, that was Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8383'>Percivale.</a>
<a id='line_8384'></a>
<a id='line_8385'></a>
<a id='line_8386'></a>
<a id='line_8387'></a>
<a id='line_8388'>CHAPTER VII. How the queen desired to see Galahad; and how after, all</a>
<a id='line_8389'>the knights were replenished with the Holy Sangreal, and how they</a>
<a id='line_8390'>avowed the enquest of the same.</a>
<a id='line_8391'></a>
<a id='line_8392'></a>
<a id='line_8393'>Then the king, at the queen’s request, made him to alight and to unlace</a>
<a id='line_8394'>his helm, that the queen might see him in the visage. When she beheld</a>
<a id='line_8395'>him she said: Soothly I dare well say that Sir Launcelot begat him, for</a>
<a id='line_8396'>never two men resembled more in likeness, therefore it nis no marvel</a>
<a id='line_8397'>though he be of great prowess. So a lady that stood by the queen said:</a>
<a id='line_8398'>Madam, for God’s sake ought he of right to be so good a knight? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_8399'>forsooth, said the queen, for he is of all parties come of the best</a>
<a id='line_8400'>knights of the world and of the highest lineage; for Sir Launcelot is</a>
<a id='line_8401'>come but of the eighth degree from our Lord Jesu Christ, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8402'>Galahad is of the ninth degree from our Lord Jesu Christ, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_8403'>dare say they be the greatest gentlemen of the world.</a>
<a id='line_8404'></a>
<a id='line_8405'>And then the king and all estates went home unto Camelot, and so went</a>
<a id='line_8406'>to evensong to the great minster, and so after upon that to supper, and</a>
<a id='line_8407'>every knight sat in his own place as they were toforehand. Then anon</a>
<a id='line_8408'>they heard cracking and crying of thunder, that them thought the place</a>
<a id='line_8409'>should all to-drive. In the midst of this blast entered a sunbeam more</a>
<a id='line_8410'>clearer by seven times than ever they saw day, and all they were</a>
<a id='line_8411'>alighted of the grace of the Holy Ghost. Then began every knight to</a>
<a id='line_8412'>behold other, and either saw other, by their seeming, fairer than ever</a>
<a id='line_8413'>they saw afore. Not for then there was no knight might speak one word a</a>
<a id='line_8414'>great while, and so they looked every man on other as they had been</a>
<a id='line_8415'>dumb. Then there entered into the hall the Holy Grail covered with</a>
<a id='line_8416'>white samite, but there was none might see it, nor who bare it. And</a>
<a id='line_8417'>there was all the hall fulfilled with good odours, and every knight had</a>
<a id='line_8418'>such meats and drinks as he best loved in this world. And when the Holy</a>
<a id='line_8419'>Grail had been borne through the hall, then the holy vessel departed</a>
<a id='line_8420'>suddenly, that they wist not where it became: then had they all breath</a>
<a id='line_8421'>to speak. And then the king yielded thankings to God, of His good grace</a>
<a id='line_8422'>that he had sent them. Certes, said the king, we ought to thank our</a>
<a id='line_8423'>Lord Jesu greatly for that he hath shewed us this day, at the reverence</a>
<a id='line_8424'>of this high feast of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_8425'></a>
<a id='line_8426'>Now, said Sir Gawaine, we have been served this day of what meats and</a>
<a id='line_8427'>drinks we thought on; but one thing beguiled us, we might not see the</a>
<a id='line_8428'>Holy Grail, it was so preciously covered. Wherefore I will make here</a>
<a id='line_8429'>avow, that to-morn, without longer abiding, I shall labour in the quest</a>
<a id='line_8430'>of the Sangreal, that I shall hold me out a twelvemonth and a day, or</a>
<a id='line_8431'>more if need be, and never shall I return again unto the court till I</a>
<a id='line_8432'>have seen it more openly than it hath been seen here; and if I may not</a>
<a id='line_8433'>speed I shall return again as he that may not be against the will of</a>
<a id='line_8434'>our Lord Jesu Christ.</a>
<a id='line_8435'></a>
<a id='line_8436'>When they of the Table Round heard Sir Gawaine say so, they arose up</a>
<a id='line_8437'>the most part and made such avows as Sir Gawaine had made. Anon as King</a>
<a id='line_8438'>Arthur heard this he was greatly displeased, for he wist well they</a>
<a id='line_8439'>might not again-say their avows. Alas, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_8440'>Gawaine, ye have nigh slain me with the avow and promise that ye have</a>
<a id='line_8441'>made; for through you ye have bereft me the fairest fellowship and the</a>
<a id='line_8442'>truest of knighthood that ever were seen together in any realm of the</a>
<a id='line_8443'>world; for when they depart from hence I am sure they all shall never</a>
<a id='line_8444'>meet more in this world, for they shall die many in the quest. And so</a>
<a id='line_8445'>it forthinketh me a little, for I have loved them as well as my life,</a>
<a id='line_8446'>wherefore it shall grieve me right sore, the departition of this</a>
<a id='line_8447'>fellowship: for I have had an old custom to have them in my fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_8448'></a>
<a id='line_8449'></a>
<a id='line_8450'></a>
<a id='line_8451'></a>
<a id='line_8452'>CHAPTER VIII. How great sorrow was made of the king and the queen and</a>
<a id='line_8453'>ladies for the departing of the knights, and how they departed.</a>
<a id='line_8454'></a>
<a id='line_8455'></a>
<a id='line_8456'>And therewith the tears fell in his eyes. And then he said: Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_8457'>Gawaine, ye have set me in great sorrow, for I have great doubt that my</a>
<a id='line_8458'>true fellowship shall never meet here more again. Ah, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8459'>Launcelot, comfort yourself; for it shall be unto us a great honour and</a>
<a id='line_8460'>much more than if we died in any other places, for of death we be</a>
<a id='line_8461'>siker. Ah, Launcelot, said the king, the great love that I have had</a>
<a id='line_8462'>unto you all the days of my life maketh me to say such doleful words;</a>
<a id='line_8463'>for never Christian king had never so many worthy men at his table as I</a>
<a id='line_8464'>have had this day at the Round Table, and that is my great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_8465'></a>
<a id='line_8466'>When the queen, ladies, and gentlewomen, wist these tidings, they had</a>
<a id='line_8467'>such sorrow and heaviness that there might no tongue tell it, for those</a>
<a id='line_8468'>knights had held them in honour and chierté. But among all other Queen</a>
<a id='line_8469'>Guenever made great sorrow. I marvel, said she, my lord would suffer</a>
<a id='line_8470'>them to depart from him. Thus was all the court troubled for the love</a>
<a id='line_8471'>of the departition of those knights. And many of those ladies that</a>
<a id='line_8472'>loved knights would have gone with their lovers; and so had they done,</a>
<a id='line_8473'>had not an old knight come among them in religious clothing; and then</a>
<a id='line_8474'>he spake all on high and said: Fair lords, which have sworn in the</a>
<a id='line_8475'>quest of the Sangreal, thus sendeth you Nacien, the hermit, word, that</a>
<a id='line_8476'>none in this quest lead lady nor gentlewoman with him, for it is not to</a>
<a id='line_8477'>do in so high a service as they labour in; for I warn you plain, he</a>
<a id='line_8478'>that is not clean of his sins he shall not see the mysteries of our</a>
<a id='line_8479'>Lord Jesu Christ. And for this cause they left these ladies and</a>
<a id='line_8480'>gentlewomen.</a>
<a id='line_8481'></a>
<a id='line_8482'>After this the queen came unto Galahad and asked him of whence he was,</a>
<a id='line_8483'>and of what country. He told her of whence he was. And son unto</a>
<a id='line_8484'>Launcelot, she said he was. As to that, he said neither yea nor nay. So</a>
<a id='line_8485'>God me help, said the queen, of your father ye need not to shame you,</a>
<a id='line_8486'>for he is the goodliest knight, and of the best men of the world come,</a>
<a id='line_8487'>and of the strain, of all parties, of kings. Wherefore ye ought of</a>
<a id='line_8488'>right to be, of your deeds, a passing good man; and certainly, she</a>
<a id='line_8489'>said, ye resemble him much. Then Sir Galahad was a little ashamed and</a>
<a id='line_8490'>said: Madam, sith ye know in certain, wherefore do ye ask it me? for he</a>
<a id='line_8491'>that is my father shall be known openly and all betimes. And then they</a>
<a id='line_8492'>went to rest them. And in the honour of the highness of Galahad he was</a>
<a id='line_8493'>led into King Arthur’s chamber, and there rested in his own bed.</a>
<a id='line_8494'></a>
<a id='line_8495'>And as soon as it was day the king arose, for he had no rest of all</a>
<a id='line_8496'>that night for sorrow. Then he went unto Gawaine and to Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_8497'>that were arisen for to hear mass. And then the king again said: Ah</a>
<a id='line_8498'>Gawaine, Gawaine, ye have betrayed me; for never shall my court be</a>
<a id='line_8499'>amended by you, but ye will never be sorry for me as I am for you. And</a>
<a id='line_8500'>therewith the tears began to run down by his visage. And therewith the</a>
<a id='line_8501'>king said: Ah, knight Sir Launcelot, I require thee thou counsel me,</a>
<a id='line_8502'>for I would that this quest were undone, an it might be Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_8503'>Launcelot, ye saw yesterday so many worthy knights that then were sworn</a>
<a id='line_8504'>that they may not leave it in no manner of wise. That wot I well, said</a>
<a id='line_8505'>the king, but it shall so heavy me at their departing that I wot well</a>
<a id='line_8506'>there shall no manner of joy remedy me. And then the king and the queen</a>
<a id='line_8507'>went unto the minster. So anon Launcelot and Gawaine commanded their</a>
<a id='line_8508'>men to bring their arms. And when they all were armed save their</a>
<a id='line_8509'>shields and their helms, then they came to their fellowship, which were</a>
<a id='line_8510'>all ready in the same wise, for to go to the minster to hear their</a>
<a id='line_8511'>service.</a>
<a id='line_8512'></a>
<a id='line_8513'>Then after the service was done the king would wit how many had</a>
<a id='line_8514'>undertaken the quest of the Holy Grail; and to accompt them he prayed</a>
<a id='line_8515'>them all. Then found they by the tale an hundred and fifty, and all</a>
<a id='line_8516'>were knights of the Round Table. And then they put on their helms and</a>
<a id='line_8517'>departed, and recommended them all wholly unto the queen; and there was</a>
<a id='line_8518'>weeping and great sorrow. Then the queen departed into her chamber and</a>
<a id='line_8519'>held her, so that no man should perceive her great sorrows. When Sir</a>
<a id='line_8520'>Launcelot missed the queen he went till her chamber, and when she saw</a>
<a id='line_8521'>him she cried aloud: O Launcelot, Launcelot, ye have betrayed me and</a>
<a id='line_8522'>put me to the death, for to leave thus my lord. Ah, madam, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_8523'>be not displeased, for I shall come again as soon as I may with my</a>
<a id='line_8524'>worship. Alas, said she, that ever I saw you; but he that suffered upon</a>
<a id='line_8525'>the cross for all mankind, he be unto you good conduct and safety, and</a>
<a id='line_8526'>all the whole fellowship.</a>
<a id='line_8527'></a>
<a id='line_8528'>Right so departed Sir Launcelot, and found his fellowship that abode</a>
<a id='line_8529'>his coming. And so they mounted upon their horses and rode through the</a>
<a id='line_8530'>streets of Camelot; and there was weeping of rich and poor, and the</a>
<a id='line_8531'>king turned away and might not speak for weeping. So within a while</a>
<a id='line_8532'>they came to a city, and a castle that hight Vagon. There they entered</a>
<a id='line_8533'>into the castle, and the lord of that castle was an old man that hight</a>
<a id='line_8534'>Vagon, and he was a good man of his living, and set open the gates, and</a>
<a id='line_8535'>made them all the cheer that he might. And so on the morn they were all</a>
<a id='line_8536'>accorded that they should depart everych from other; and on the morn</a>
<a id='line_8537'>they departed with weeping cheer, and every knight took the way that</a>
<a id='line_8538'>him liked best.</a>
<a id='line_8539'></a>

<a id='line_8543'>CHAPTER IX. How Galahad gat him a shield, and how they sped that</a>
<a id='line_8544'>presumed to take down the said shield.</a>
<a id='line_8545'></a>
<a id='line_8546'></a>
<a id='line_8547'>Now rideth Sir Galahad yet without shield, and so he rode four days</a>
<a id='line_8548'>without any adventure. And at the fourth day after evensong he came to</a>
<a id='line_8549'>a White Abbey, and there he was received with great reverence, and led</a>
<a id='line_8550'>unto a chamber, and there was he unarmed; and then was he ware of two</a>
<a id='line_8551'>knights of the Table Round, one was Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Uwaine.</a>
<a id='line_8552'></a>
<a id='line_8553'>And when they saw him they went unto Galahad and made of him great</a>
<a id='line_8554'>solace, and so they went unto supper. Sirs, said Sir Galahad, what</a>
<a id='line_8555'>adventure brought you hither? Sir, said they, it is told us that within</a>
<a id='line_8556'>this place is a shield that no man may bear about his neck but he be</a>
<a id='line_8557'>mischieved outher dead within three days, or maimed for ever. Ah sir,</a>
<a id='line_8558'>said King Bagdemagus, I shall it bear to-morrow for to assay this</a>
<a id='line_8559'>adventure. In the name of God, said Sir Galahad. Sir, said Bagdemagus,</a>
<a id='line_8560'>an I may not enchieve the adventure of this shield ye shall take it</a>
<a id='line_8561'>upon you, for I am sure ye shall not fail. Sir, said Galahad, I right</a>
<a id='line_8562'>well agree me thereto, for I have no shield. So on the morn they arose</a>
<a id='line_8563'>and heard mass. Then Bagdemagus asked where the adventurous shield was.</a>
<a id='line_8564'>Anon a monk led him behind an altar where the shield hung as white as</a>
<a id='line_8565'>any snow, but in the midst was a red cross. Sir, said the monk, this</a>
<a id='line_8566'>shield ought not to be hanged about no knight’s neck but he be the</a>
<a id='line_8567'>worthiest knight of the world;</a>
<a id='line_8568'></a>
<a id='line_8569'>therefore I counsel you knights to be well advised. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_8570'>Bagdemagus, I wot well that I am not the best knight of the world, but</a>
<a id='line_8571'>yet I shall assay to bear it, and so bare it out of the minster. And</a>
<a id='line_8572'>then he said unto Galahad: An it please you abide here still, till ye</a>
<a id='line_8573'>wit how that I speed. I shall abide you, said Galahad. Then King</a>
<a id='line_8574'>Bagdemagus took with him a good squire, to bring tidings unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_8575'>Galahad how he sped.</a>
<a id='line_8576'></a>
<a id='line_8577'>Then when they had ridden a two mile and came to a fair valley afore an</a>
<a id='line_8578'>hermitage, then they saw a knight come from that part in white armour,</a>
<a id='line_8579'>horse and all; and he came as fast as his horse might run, and his</a>
<a id='line_8580'>spear in his rest, and Bagdemagus dressed his spear against him and</a>
<a id='line_8581'>brake it upon the white knight. But the other struck him so hard that</a>
<a id='line_8582'>he brast the mails, and sheef him through the right shoulder, for the</a>
<a id='line_8583'>shield covered him not as at that time; and so he bare him from his</a>
<a id='line_8584'>horse. And therewith he alighted and took the white shield from him,</a>
<a id='line_8585'>saying: Knight, thou hast done thyself great folly, for this shield</a>
<a id='line_8586'>ought not to be borne but by him that shall have no peer that liveth.</a>
<a id='line_8587'>And then he came to Bagdemagus’ squire and said: Bear this shield unto</a>
<a id='line_8588'>the good knight Sir Galahad, that thou left in the abbey, and greet him</a>
<a id='line_8589'>well by me. Sir, said the squire, what is your name? Take thou no heed</a>
<a id='line_8590'>of my name, said the knight, for it is not for thee to know nor for</a>
<a id='line_8591'>none earthly man. Now, fair sir, said the squire, at the reverence of</a>
<a id='line_8592'>Jesu Christ, tell me for what cause this shield may not be borne but if</a>
<a id='line_8593'>the bearer thereof be mischieved. Now sith thou hast conjured me so,</a>
<a id='line_8594'>said the knight, this shield behoveth unto no man but unto Galahad. And</a>
<a id='line_8595'>the squire went unto Bagdemagus and asked whether he were sore wounded</a>
<a id='line_8596'>or not. Yea forsooth, said he, I shall escape hard from the death. Then</a>
<a id='line_8597'>he fetched his horse, and brought him with great pain unto an abbey.</a>
<a id='line_8598'>Then was he taken down softly and unarmed, and laid in a bed, and there</a>
<a id='line_8599'>was looked to his wounds. And as the book telleth, he lay there long,</a>
<a id='line_8600'>and escaped hard with the life.</a>
<a id='line_8601'></a>

<a id='line_8604'></a>
<a id='line_8605'>CHAPTER X. How Galahad departed with the shield, and how King Evelake</a>
<a id='line_8606'>had received the shield of Joseph of Aramathie.</a>
<a id='line_8607'></a>
<a id='line_8608'></a>
<a id='line_8609'>Sir Galahad, said the squire, that knight that wounded Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_8610'>sendeth you greeting, and bade that ye should bear this shield,</a>
<a id='line_8611'>wherethrough great adventures should befall. Now blessed be God and</a>
<a id='line_8612'>fortune, said Galahad. And then he asked his arms, and mounted upon his</a>
<a id='line_8613'>horse, and hung the white shield about his neck, and commended them</a>
<a id='line_8614'>unto God. And Sir Uwaine said he would bear him fellowship if it</a>
<a id='line_8615'>pleased him. Sir, said Galahad, that may ye not, for I must go alone,</a>
<a id='line_8616'>save this squire shall bear me fellowship: and so departed Uwaine.</a>
<a id='line_8617'></a>
<a id='line_8618'>Then within a while came Galahad thereas the White Knight abode him by</a>
<a id='line_8619'>the hermitage, and everych saluted other courteously. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8620'>Galahad, by this shield be many marvels fallen. Sir, said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_8621'>it befell after the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ thirty-two year,</a>
<a id='line_8622'>that Joseph of Aramathie, the gentle knight, the which took down our</a>
<a id='line_8623'>Lord off the holy Cross, at that time he departed from Jerusalem with a</a>
<a id='line_8624'>great party of his kindred with him. And so he laboured till that they</a>
<a id='line_8625'>came to a city that hight Sarras. And at that same hour that Joseph</a>
<a id='line_8626'>came to Sarras there was a king that hight Evelake, that had great war</a>
<a id='line_8627'>against the Saracens, and in especial against one Saracen, the which</a>
<a id='line_8628'>was King Evelake’s cousin, a rich king and a mighty, which marched nigh</a>
<a id='line_8629'>this land, and his name was called Tolleme la Feintes. So on a day</a>
<a id='line_8630'>these two met to do battle. Then Joseph, the son of Joseph of</a>
<a id='line_8631'>Aramathie, went to King Evelake and told him he should be discomfit and</a>
<a id='line_8632'>slain, but if he left his belief of the old law and believed upon the</a>
<a id='line_8633'>new law. And then there he shewed him the right belief of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_8634'>Trinity, to the which he agreed unto with all his heart; and there this</a>
<a id='line_8635'>shield was made for King Evelake, in the name of Him that died upon the</a>
<a id='line_8636'>Cross. And then through his good belief he had the better of King</a>
<a id='line_8637'>Tolleme. For when Evelake was in the battle there was a cloth set afore</a>
<a id='line_8638'>the shield, and when he was in the greatest peril he let put away the</a>
<a id='line_8639'>cloth, and then his enemies saw a figure of a man on the Cross,</a>
<a id='line_8640'>wherethrough they all were discomfit. And so it befell that a man of</a>
<a id='line_8641'>King Evelake’s was smitten his hand off, and bare that hand in his</a>
<a id='line_8642'>other hand; and Joseph called that man unto him and bade him go with</a>
<a id='line_8643'>good devotion touch the Cross. And as soon as that man had touched the</a>
<a id='line_8644'>Cross with his hand it was as whole as ever it was to-fore. Then soon</a>
<a id='line_8645'>after there fell a great marvel, that the cross of the shield at one</a>
<a id='line_8646'>time vanished away that no man wist where it became. And then King</a>
<a id='line_8647'>Evelake was baptised, and for the most part all the people of that</a>
<a id='line_8648'>city. So, soon after Joseph would depart, and King Evelake would go</a>
<a id='line_8649'>with him, whether he wold or nold. And so by fortune they came into</a>
<a id='line_8650'>this land, that at that time was called Great Britain; and there they</a>
<a id='line_8651'>found a great felon paynim, that put Joseph into prison. And so by</a>
<a id='line_8652'>fortune tidings came unto a worthy man that hight Mondrames, and he</a>
<a id='line_8653'>assembled all his people for the great renown he had heard of Joseph;</a>
<a id='line_8654'>and so he came into the land of Great Britain and disherited this felon</a>
<a id='line_8655'>paynim and consumed him, and therewith delivered Joseph out of prison.</a>
<a id='line_8656'>And after that all the people were turned to the Christian faith.</a>
<a id='line_8657'></a>
<a id='line_8658'></a>
<a id='line_8659'></a>
<a id='line_8660'></a>
<a id='line_8661'>CHAPTER XI. How Joseph made a cross on the white shield with his blood,</a>
<a id='line_8662'>and how Galahad was by a monk brought to a tomb.</a>
<a id='line_8663'></a>
<a id='line_8664'></a>
<a id='line_8665'>Not long after that Joseph was laid in his deadly bed. And when King</a>
<a id='line_8666'>Evelake saw that he made much sorrow, and said: For thy love I have</a>
<a id='line_8667'>left my country, and sith ye shall depart out of this world, leave me</a>
<a id='line_8668'>some token of yours that I may think on you. Joseph said: That will I</a>
<a id='line_8669'>do full gladly; now bring me your shield that I took you when ye went</a>
<a id='line_8670'>into battle against King Tolleme. Then Joseph bled sore at the nose, so</a>
<a id='line_8671'>that he might not by no mean be staunched. And there upon that shield</a>
<a id='line_8672'>he made a cross of his own blood. Now may ye see a remembrance that I</a>
<a id='line_8673'>love you, for ye shall never see this shield but ye shall think on me,</a>
<a id='line_8674'>and it shall be always as fresh as it is now. And never shall man bear</a>
<a id='line_8675'>this shield about his neck but he shall repent it, unto the time that</a>
<a id='line_8676'>Galahad, the good knight, bear it; and the last of my lineage shall</a>
<a id='line_8677'>have it about his neck, that shall do many marvellous deeds. Now, said</a>
<a id='line_8678'>King Evelake, where shall I put this shield, that this worthy knight</a>
<a id='line_8679'>may have it? Ye shall leave it thereas Nacien, the hermit, shall be put</a>
<a id='line_8680'>after his death; for thither shall that good knight come the fifteenth</a>
<a id='line_8681'>day after that he shall receive the order of knighthood: and so that</a>
<a id='line_8682'>day that they set is this time that he have his shield, and in the same</a>
<a id='line_8683'>abbey lieth Nacien, the hermit. And then the White Knight vanished</a>
<a id='line_8684'>away.</a>
<a id='line_8685'></a>
<a id='line_8686'>Anon as the squire had heard these words, he alighted off his hackney</a>
<a id='line_8687'>and kneeled down at Galahad’s feet, and prayed him that he might go</a>
<a id='line_8688'>with him till he had made him knight.</a>
<a id='line_8689'></a>
<a id='line_8690'>If I would not refuse you.</a>
<a id='line_8691'></a>
<a id='line_8692'>Then will ye make me a knight? said the squire, and that order, by the</a>
<a id='line_8693'>grace of God, shall be well set in me.</a>
<a id='line_8694'></a>
<a id='line_8695'>So Sir Galahad granted him, and turned again unto the abbey where they</a>
<a id='line_8696'>came from; and there men made great joy of Sir Galahad. And anon as he</a>
<a id='line_8697'>was alighted there was a monk brought him unto a tomb in a churchyard,</a>
<a id='line_8698'>where there was such a noise that who that heard it should verily nigh</a>
<a id='line_8699'>be mad or lose his strength: and sir, they said, we deem it is a fiend.</a>
<a id='line_8700'></a>
<a id='line_8701'></a>
<a id='line_8702'></a>
<a id='line_8703'></a>
<a id='line_8704'>CHAPTER XII. Of the marvel that Sir Galahad saw and heard in the tomb,</a>
<a id='line_8705'>and how he made Melias knight.</a>
<a id='line_8706'></a>
<a id='line_8707'></a>
<a id='line_8708'>Now lead me thither, said Galahad. And so they did, all armed save his</a>
<a id='line_8709'>helm. Now, said the good man, go to the tomb and lift it up. So he did,</a>
<a id='line_8710'>and heard a great noise; and piteously he said, that all men might hear</a>
<a id='line_8711'>it: Sir Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, come thou not nigh me, for</a>
<a id='line_8712'>thou shalt make me go again there where I have been so long. But</a>
<a id='line_8713'>Galahad was nothing afraid, but lifted up the stone; and there came out</a>
<a id='line_8714'>so foul a smoke, and after he saw the foulest figure leap thereout that</a>
<a id='line_8715'>ever he saw in the likeness of a man; and then he blessed him and wist</a>
<a id='line_8716'>well it was a fiend. Then heard he a voice say Galahad, I see there</a>
<a id='line_8717'>environ about thee so many angels that my power may not dere thee{sic}</a>
<a id='line_8718'>Right so Sir Galahad saw a body all armed lie in that tomb, and beside</a>
<a id='line_8719'>him a sword. Now, fair brother, said Galahad, let us remove this body,</a>
<a id='line_8720'>for it is not worthy to lie in this churchyard, for he was a false</a>
<a id='line_8721'>Christian man. And therewith they all departed and went to the abbey.</a>
<a id='line_8722'>And anon as he was unarmed a good man came and set him down by him and</a>
<a id='line_8723'>said: Sir, I shall tell you what betokeneth all that ye saw in the</a>
<a id='line_8724'>tomb; for that covered body betokeneth the duresse of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_8725'>the great sin that Our Lord found in the world. For there was such</a>
<a id='line_8726'>wretchedness that the father loved not the son, nor the son loved not</a>
<a id='line_8727'>the father; and that was one of the causes that Our Lord took flesh and</a>
<a id='line_8728'>blood of a clean maiden, for our sins were so great at that time that</a>
<a id='line_8729'>well-nigh all was wickedness. Truly, said Galahad, I believe you right</a>
<a id='line_8730'>well.</a>
<a id='line_8731'></a>
<a id='line_8732'>So Sir Galahad rested him there that night; and upon the morn he made</a>
<a id='line_8733'>the squire knight, and asked him his name, and of what kindred he was</a>
<a id='line_8734'>come. Sir, said he, men calleth me Melias de Lile, and I am the son of</a>
<a id='line_8735'>the King of Denmark. Now, fair sir, said Galahad, sith that ye be come</a>
<a id='line_8736'>of kings and queens, now look that knighthood be well set in you, for</a>
<a id='line_8737'>ye ought to be a mirror unto all chivalry. Sir, said Sir Melias, ye say</a>
<a id='line_8738'>sooth. But, sir, sithen ye have made me a knight ye must of right grant</a>
<a id='line_8739'>me my first desire that is reasonable. Ye say sooth, said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_8740'>Melias said: Then that ye will suffer me to ride with you in this quest</a>
<a id='line_8741'>of the Sangreal, till that some adventure depart us. I grant you, sir.</a>
<a id='line_8742'></a>
<a id='line_8743'>Then men brought Sir Melias his armour and his spear and his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_8744'>so Sir Galahad and he rode forth all that week or they found any</a>
<a id='line_8745'>adventure. And then upon a Monday in the morning, as they were departed</a>
<a id='line_8746'>from an abbey, they came to a cross which departed two ways, and in</a>
<a id='line_8747'>that cross were letters written that said thus: Now, ye knights errant,</a>
<a id='line_8748'>the which goeth to seek knights adventurous, see here two ways; that</a>
<a id='line_8749'>one way defendeth thee that thou ne go that way, for he shall not go</a>
<a id='line_8750'>out of the way again but if he be a good man and a worthy knight; and</a>
<a id='line_8751'>if thou go on the left hand, thou shalt not lightly there win prowess,</a>
<a id='line_8752'>for thou shalt in this way be soon assayed. Sir, said Melias to</a>
<a id='line_8753'>Galahad, if it like you to suffer me to take the way on the left hand,</a>
<a id='line_8754'>tell me, for there I shall well prove my strength. It were better, said</a>
<a id='line_8755'>Galahad, ye rode not that way, for I deem I should better escape in</a>
<a id='line_8756'>that way than ye. Nay, my lord, I pray you let me have that adventure.</a>
<a id='line_8757'>Take it in God’s name, said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_8758'></a>
<a id='line_8759'></a>
<a id='line_8760'></a>
<a id='line_8761'></a>
<a id='line_8762'>CHAPTER XIII. Of the adventure that Melias had, and how Galahad</a>
<a id='line_8763'>revenged him, and how Melias was carried into an abbey.</a>
<a id='line_8764'></a>
<a id='line_8765'></a>
<a id='line_8766'>And then rode Melias into an old forest, and therein he rode two days</a>
<a id='line_8767'>and more. And then he came into a fair meadow, and there was a fair</a>
<a id='line_8768'>lodge of boughs. And then he espied in that lodge a chair, wherein was</a>
<a id='line_8769'>a crown of gold, subtly wrought. Also there were cloths covered upon</a>
<a id='line_8770'>the earth, and many delicious meats set thereon. Sir Melias beheld this</a>
<a id='line_8771'>adventure, and thought it marvellous, but he had no hunger, but of the</a>
<a id='line_8772'>crown of gold he took much keep; and therewith he stooped down and took</a>
<a id='line_8773'>it up, and rode his way with it. And anon he saw a knight came riding</a>
<a id='line_8774'>after him that said: Knight, set down that crown which is not yours,</a>
<a id='line_8775'>and therefore defend you. Then Sir Melias blessed him and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_8776'>lord of heaven, help and save thy new-made knight. And then they let</a>
<a id='line_8777'>their horses run as fast as they might, so that the other knight smote</a>
<a id='line_8778'>Sir Melias through hauberk and through the left side, that he fell to</a>
<a id='line_8779'>the earth nigh dead. And then he took the crown and went his way; and</a>
<a id='line_8780'>Sir Melias lay still and had no power to stir.</a>
<a id='line_8781'></a>
<a id='line_8782'>In the meanwhile by fortune there came Sir Galahad and found him there</a>
<a id='line_8783'>in peril of death. And then he said: Ah Melias, who hath wounded you?</a>
<a id='line_8784'>therefore it had been better to have ridden the other way. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_8785'>Melias heard him speak: Sir, he said, for God’s love let me not die in</a>
<a id='line_8786'>this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here beside, that I may be</a>
<a id='line_8787'>confessed and have my rights. It shall be done, said Galahad, but where</a>
<a id='line_8788'>is he that hath wounded you? With that Sir Galahad heard in the leaves</a>
<a id='line_8789'>cry on high: Knight, keep thee from me. Ah sir, said Melias, beware,</a>
<a id='line_8790'>for that is he that hath slain me. Sir Galahad answered: Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_8791'>come on your peril. Then either dressed to other, and came together as</a>
<a id='line_8792'>fast as their horses might run, and Galahad smote him so that his spear</a>
<a id='line_8793'>went through his shoulder, and smote him down off his horse, and in the</a>
<a id='line_8794'>falling Galahad’s spear brake.</a>
<a id='line_8795'></a>
<a id='line_8796'>With that came out another knight out of the leaves, and brake a spear</a>
<a id='line_8797'>upon Galahad or ever he might turn him. Then Galahad drew out his sword</a>
<a id='line_8798'>and smote off the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth. And</a>
<a id='line_8799'>then he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast after him. And then he</a>
<a id='line_8800'>turned again unto Sir Melias, and there he alighted and dressed him</a>
<a id='line_8801'>softly on his horse to-fore him, for the truncheon of his spear was in</a>
<a id='line_8802'>his body; and Sir Galahad stert up behind him, and held him in his</a>
<a id='line_8803'>arms, and so brought him to the abbey, and there unarmed him and</a>
<a id='line_8804'>brought him to his chamber. And then he asked his Saviour. And when he</a>
<a id='line_8805'>had received Him he said unto Sir Galahad: Sir, let death come when it</a>
<a id='line_8806'>pleaseth him. And therewith he drew out the truncheon of the spear out</a>
<a id='line_8807'>of his body: and then he swooned.</a>
<a id='line_8808'></a>
<a id='line_8809'>Then came there an old monk which sometime had been a knight, and</a>
<a id='line_8810'>beheld Sir Melias. And anon he ransacked him; and then he said unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_8811'>Galahad: I shall heal him of his wound, by the grace of God, within the</a>
<a id='line_8812'>term of seven weeks. Then was Sir Galahad glad, and unarmed him, and</a>
<a id='line_8813'>said he would abide there three days. And then he asked Sir Melias how</a>
<a id='line_8814'>it stood with him. Then he said he was turned unto helping, God be</a>
<a id='line_8815'>thanked.</a>
<a id='line_8816'></a>

<a id='line_8819'></a>
<a id='line_8820'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Galahad departed, and how he was commanded to go</a>
<a id='line_8821'>to the Castle of Maidens to destroy the wicked custom.</a>
<a id='line_8822'></a>
<a id='line_8823'></a>
<a id='line_8824'>Now will I depart, said Galahad, for I have much on hand, for many good</a>
<a id='line_8825'>knights be full busy about it, and this knight and I were in the same</a>
<a id='line_8826'>quest of the Sangreal. Sir, said a good man, for his sin he was thus</a>
<a id='line_8827'>wounded; and I marvel, said the good man, how ye durst take upon you so</a>
<a id='line_8828'>rich a thing as the high order of knighthood without clean confession,</a>
<a id='line_8829'>and that was the cause ye were bitterly wounded. For the way on the</a>
<a id='line_8830'>right hand betokeneth the highway of our Lord Jesu Christ, and the way</a>
<a id='line_8831'>of a good true good liver. And the other way betokeneth the way of</a>
<a id='line_8832'>sinners and of misbelievers. And when the devil saw your pride and</a>
<a id='line_8833'>presumption, for to take you in the quest of the Sangreal, that made</a>
<a id='line_8834'>you to be overthrown, for it may not be enchieved but by virtuous</a>
<a id='line_8835'>living. Also, the writing on the cross was a signification of heavenly</a>
<a id='line_8836'>deeds, and of knightly deeds in God’s works, and no knightly deeds in</a>
<a id='line_8837'>worldly works. And pride is head of all deadly sins, that caused this</a>
<a id='line_8838'>knight to depart from Galahad. And where thou tookest the crown of gold</a>
<a id='line_8839'>thou sinnest in covetise and in theft: all this were no knightly deeds.</a>
<a id='line_8840'>And this Galahad, the holy knight, the which fought with the two</a>
<a id='line_8841'>knights, the two knights signify the two deadly sins which were wholly</a>
<a id='line_8842'>in this knight Melias; and they might not withstand you, for ye are</a>
<a id='line_8843'>without deadly sin.</a>
<a id='line_8844'></a>
<a id='line_8845'>Now departed Galahad from thence, and betaught them all unto God. Sir</a>
<a id='line_8846'>Melias said: My lord Galahad, as soon as I may ride I shall seek you.</a>
<a id='line_8847'>God send you health, said Galahad, and so took his horse and departed,</a>
<a id='line_8848'>and rode many journeys forward and backward, as adventure would lead</a>
<a id='line_8849'>him. And at the last it happened him to depart from a place or a castle</a>
<a id='line_8850'>the which was named Abblasoure; and he had heard no mass, the which he</a>
<a id='line_8851'>was wont ever to hear or ever he departed out of any castle or place,</a>
<a id='line_8852'>and kept that for a custom. Then Sir Galahad came unto a mountain where</a>
<a id='line_8853'>he found an old chapel, and found there nobody, for all, all was</a>
<a id='line_8854'>desolate; and there he kneeled to-fore the altar, and besought God of</a>
<a id='line_8855'>wholesome counsel. So as he prayed he heard a voice that said: Go thou</a>
<a id='line_8856'>now, thou adventurous knight, to the Castle of Maidens, and there do</a>
<a id='line_8857'>thou away the wicked customs.</a>
<a id='line_8858'></a>

<a id='line_8860'></a>
<a id='line_8861'></a>
<a id='line_8862'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Galahad fought with the knights of the castle, and</a>
<a id='line_8863'>destroyed the wicked custom.</a>
<a id='line_8864'></a>
<a id='line_8865'></a>
<a id='line_8866'>When Sir Galahad heard this he thanked God, and took his horse; and he</a>
<a id='line_8867'>had not ridden but half a mile, he saw in the valley afore him a strong</a>
<a id='line_8868'>castle with deep ditches, and there ran beside it a fair river that</a>
<a id='line_8869'>hight Severn; and there he met with a man of great age, and either</a>
<a id='line_8870'>saluted other, and Galahad asked him the castle’s name. Fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_8871'>he, it is the Castle of Maidens. That is a cursed castle, said Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_8872'>and all they that be conversant therein, for all pity is out thereof,</a>
<a id='line_8873'>and all hardiness and mischief is therein. Therefore, I counsel you,</a>
<a id='line_8874'>sir knight, to turn again. Sir, said Galahad, wit you well I shall not</a>
<a id='line_8875'>turn again. Then looked Sir Galahad on his arms that nothing failed</a>
<a id='line_8876'>him, and then he put his shield afore him; and anon there met him seven</a>
<a id='line_8877'>fair maidens, the which said unto him: Sir knight, ye ride here in a</a>
<a id='line_8878'>great folly, for ye have the water to pass over. Why should I not pass</a>
<a id='line_8879'>the water? said Galahad. So rode he away from them and met with a</a>
<a id='line_8880'>squire that said: Knight, those knights in the castle defy you, and</a>
<a id='line_8881'>defenden you ye go no further till that they wit what ye would. Fair</a>
<a id='line_8882'>sir, said Galahad, I come for to destroy the wicked custom of this</a>
<a id='line_8883'>castle. Sir, an ye will abide by that ye shall have enough to do. Go</a>
<a id='line_8884'>you now, said Galahad, and haste my needs.</a>
<a id='line_8885'></a>
<a id='line_8886'>Then the squire entered into the castle. And anon after there came out</a>
<a id='line_8887'>of the castle seven knights, and all were brethren. And when they saw</a>
<a id='line_8888'>Galahad they cried: Knight, keep thee, for we assure thee nothing but</a>
<a id='line_8889'>death. Why, said Galahad, will ye all have ado with me at once? Yea,</a>
<a id='line_8890'>said they, thereto mayst thou trust. Then Galahad put forth his spear</a>
<a id='line_8891'>and smote the foremost to the earth, that near he brake his neck. And</a>
<a id='line_8892'>therewithal the other smote him on his shield great strokes, so that</a>
<a id='line_8893'>their spears brake. Then Sir Galahad drew out his sword, and set upon</a>
<a id='line_8894'>them so hard that it was marvel to see it, and so through great force</a>
<a id='line_8895'>he made them to forsake the field; and Galahad chased them till they</a>
<a id='line_8896'>entered into the castle, and so passed through the castle at another</a>
<a id='line_8897'>gate.</a>
<a id='line_8898'></a>
<a id='line_8899'>And there met Sir Galahad an old man clothed in religious clothing, and</a>
<a id='line_8900'>said: Sir, have here the keys of this castle. Then Sir Galahad opened</a>
<a id='line_8901'>the gates, and saw so much people in the streets that he might not</a>
<a id='line_8902'>number them, and all said: Sir, ye be welcome, for long have we abiden</a>
<a id='line_8903'>here our deliverance. Then came to him a gentlewoman and said: These</a>
<a id='line_8904'>knights be fled, but they will come again this night, and here to begin</a>
<a id='line_8905'>again their evil custom. What will ye that I shall do? said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_8906'>Sir, said the gentlewoman, that ye send after all the knights hither</a>
<a id='line_8907'>that hold their lands of this castle, and make them to swear for to use</a>
<a id='line_8908'>the customs that were used heretofore of old time. I will well, said</a>
<a id='line_8909'>Galahad. And there she brought him an horn of ivory, bounden with gold</a>
<a id='line_8910'>richly, and said: Sir, blow this horn which will be heard two mile</a>
<a id='line_8911'>about this castle. When Sir Galahad had blown the horn he set him down</a>
<a id='line_8912'>upon a bed.</a>
<a id='line_8913'></a>
<a id='line_8914'>Then came a priest to Galahad, and said: Sir, it is past a seven year</a>
<a id='line_8915'>agone that these seven brethren came into this castle, and harboured</a>
<a id='line_8916'>with the lord of this castle that hight the Duke Lianour, and he was</a>
<a id='line_8917'>lord of all this country. And when they espied the duke’s daughter,</a>
<a id='line_8918'>that was a full fair woman, then by their false covin they made debate</a>
<a id='line_8919'>betwixt themself, and the duke of his goodness would have departed</a>
<a id='line_8920'>them, and there they slew him and his eldest son. And then they took</a>
<a id='line_8921'>the maiden and the treasure of the castle. And then by great force they</a>
<a id='line_8922'>held all the knights of this castle against their will under their</a>
<a id='line_8923'>obeissance, and in great service and truage, robbing and pilling the</a>
<a id='line_8924'>poor common people of all that they had. So it happened on a day the</a>
<a id='line_8925'>duke’s daughter said: Ye have done unto me great wrong to slay mine own</a>
<a id='line_8926'>father, and my brother, and thus to hold our lands: not for then, she</a>
<a id='line_8927'>said, ye shall not hold this castle for many years, for by one knight</a>
<a id='line_8928'>ye shall be overcome. Thus she prophesied seven years agone. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_8929'>the seven knights, sithen ye say so, there shall never lady nor knight</a>
<a id='line_8930'>pass this castle but they shall abide maugre their heads, or die</a>
<a id='line_8931'>therefore, till that knight be come by whom we shall lose this castle.</a>
<a id='line_8932'>And therefore is it called the Maidens’ Castle, for they have devoured</a>
<a id='line_8933'>many maidens. Now, said Galahad, is she here for whom this castle was</a>
<a id='line_8934'>lost? Nay sir, said the priest, she was dead within these three nights</a>
<a id='line_8935'>after that she was thus enforced; and sithen have they kept her younger</a>
<a id='line_8936'>sister, which endureth great pains with mo other ladies.</a>
<a id='line_8937'></a>
<a id='line_8938'>By this were the knights of the country come, and then he made them do</a>
<a id='line_8939'>homage and fealty to the king’s daughter, and set them in great ease of</a>
<a id='line_8940'>heart. And in the morn there came one to Galahad and told him how that</a>
<a id='line_8941'>Gawaine, Gareth, and Uwaine, had slain the seven brethren. I suppose</a>
<a id='line_8942'>well, said Sir Galahad, and took his armour and his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_8943'>commended them unto God.</a>
<a id='line_8944'></a>
<a id='line_8945'></a>
<a id='line_8946'></a>
<a id='line_8947'></a>
<a id='line_8948'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Gawaine came to the abbey for to follow Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_8949'>and how he was shriven to a hermit.</a>
<a id='line_8950'></a>
<a id='line_8951'></a>
<a id='line_8952'>Now, saith the tale, after Sir Gawaine departed, he rode many journeys,</a>
<a id='line_8953'>both toward and froward. And at the last he came to the abbey where Sir</a>
<a id='line_8954'>Galahad had the white shield, and there Sir Gawaine learned the way to</a>
<a id='line_8955'>sewe after Sir Galahad; and so he rode to the abbey where Melias lay</a>
<a id='line_8956'>sick, and there Sir Melias told Sir Gawaine of the marvellous</a>
<a id='line_8957'>adventures that Sir Galahad did. Certes, said Sir Gawaine, I am not</a>
<a id='line_8958'>happy that I took not the way that he went, for an I may meet with him</a>
<a id='line_8959'>I will not depart from him lightly, for all marvellous adventures Sir</a>
<a id='line_8960'>Galahad enchieveth. Sir, said one of the monks, he will not of your</a>
<a id='line_8961'>fellowship. Why? said Sir Gawaine. Sir, said he, for ye be wicked and</a>
<a id='line_8962'>sinful, and he is full blessed. Right as they thus stood talking there</a>
<a id='line_8963'>came in riding Sir Gareth. And then they made joy either of other. And</a>
<a id='line_8964'>on the morn they heard mass, and so departed. And by the way they met</a>
<a id='line_8965'>with Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and there Sir Uwaine told Sir Gawaine how</a>
<a id='line_8966'>he had met with none adventure sith he departed from the court. Nor we,</a>
<a id='line_8967'>said Sir Gawaine. And either promised other of the three knights not to</a>
<a id='line_8968'>depart while they were in that quest, but if fortune caused it.</a>
<a id='line_8969'></a>
<a id='line_8970'>So they departed and rode by fortune till that they came by the Castle</a>
<a id='line_8971'>of Maidens; and there the seven brethren espied the three knights, and</a>
<a id='line_8972'>said: Sithen, we be flemed by one knight from this castle, we shall</a>
<a id='line_8973'>destroy all the knights of King Arthur’s that we may overcome, for the</a>
<a id='line_8974'>love of Sir Galahad. And therewith the seven knights set upon the three</a>
<a id='line_8975'>knights, and by fortune Sir Gawaine slew one of the brethren, and each</a>
<a id='line_8976'>one of his fellows slew another, and so slew the remnant. And then they</a>
<a id='line_8977'>took the way under the castle, and there they lost the way that Sir</a>
<a id='line_8978'>Galahad rode, and there everych of them departed from other; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_8979'>Gawaine rode till he came to an hermitage, and there he found the good</a>
<a id='line_8980'>man saying his evensong of Our Lady; and there Sir Gawaine asked</a>
<a id='line_8981'>harbour for charity, and the good man granted it him gladly.</a>
<a id='line_8982'></a>
<a id='line_8983'>Then the good man asked him what he was. Sir, he said, I am a knight of</a>
<a id='line_8984'>King Arthur’s that am in the quest of the Sangreal, and my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_8985'>Gawaine. Sir, said the good man, I would wit how it standeth betwixt</a>
<a id='line_8986'>God and you. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I will with a good will shew you my</a>
<a id='line_8987'>life if it please you; and there he told the hermit how a monk of an</a>
<a id='line_8988'>abbey called me wicked knight. He might well say it, said the hermit,</a>
<a id='line_8989'>for when ye were first made knight ye should have taken you to knightly</a>
<a id='line_8990'>deeds and virtuous living, and ye have done the contrary, for ye have</a>
<a id='line_8991'>lived mischievously many winters; and Sir Galahad is a maid and sinned</a>
<a id='line_8992'>never, and that is the cause he shall enchieve where he goeth that ye</a>
<a id='line_8993'>nor none such shall not attain, nor none in your fellowship, for ye</a>
<a id='line_8994'>have used the most untruest life that ever I heard knight live. For</a>
<a id='line_8995'>certes had ye not been so wicked as ye are, never had the seven</a>
<a id='line_8996'>brethren been slain by you and your two fellows. For Sir Galahad</a>
<a id='line_8997'>himself alone beat them all seven the day to-fore, but his living is</a>
<a id='line_8998'>such he shall slay no man lightly. Also I may say you the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_8999'>Maidens betokeneth the good souls that were in prison afore the</a>
<a id='line_9000'>Incarnation of Jesu Christ. And the seven knights betoken the seven</a>
<a id='line_9001'>deadly sins that reigned that time in the world; and I may liken the</a>
<a id='line_9002'>good Galahad unto the son of the High Father, that lighted within a</a>
<a id='line_9003'>maid, and bought all the souls out of thrall, so did Sir Galahad</a>
<a id='line_9004'>deliver all the maidens out of the woful castle.</a>
<a id='line_9005'></a>
<a id='line_9006'>Now, Sir Gawaine, said the good man, thou must do penance for thy sin.</a>
<a id='line_9007'>Sir, what penance shall I do? Such as I will give, said the good man.</a>
<a id='line_9008'>Nay, said Sir Gawaine, I may do no penance; for we knights adventurous</a>
<a id='line_9009'>oft suffer great woe and pain. Well, said the good man, and then he</a>
<a id='line_9010'>held his peace. And on the morn Sir Gawaine departed from the hermit,</a>
<a id='line_9011'>and betaught him unto God. And by adventure he met with Sir Aglovale</a>
<a id='line_9012'>and Sir Griflet, two knights of the Table Round. And they two rode four</a>
<a id='line_9013'>days without finding of any adventure, and at the fifth day they</a>
<a id='line_9014'>departed. And everych held as fell them by adventure. Here leaveth the</a>
<a id='line_9015'>tale of Sir Gawaine and his fellows, and speak we of Sir Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_9016'></a>
<a id='line_9017'></a>
<a id='line_9018'></a>
<a id='line_9019'></a>
<a id='line_9020'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Galahad met with Sir Launcelot and Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_9021'>and smote them down, and departed from them.</a>
<a id='line_9022'></a>
<a id='line_9023'></a>
<a id='line_9024'>So when Sir Galahad was departed from the Castle of Maidens he rode</a>
<a id='line_9025'>till he came to a waste forest, and there he met with Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_9026'>Sir Percivale, but they knew him not, for he was new disguised. Right</a>
<a id='line_9027'>so Sir Launcelot, his father, dressed his spear and brake it upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_9028'>Galahad, and Galahad smote him so again that he smote down horse and</a>
<a id='line_9029'>man. And then he drew his sword, and dressed him unto Sir Percivale,</a>
<a id='line_9030'>and smote him so on the helm, that it rove to the coif of steel; and</a>
<a id='line_9031'>had not the sword swerved Sir Percivale had been slain, and with the</a>
<a id='line_9032'>stroke he fell out of his saddle. This jousts was done to-fore the</a>
<a id='line_9033'>hermitage where a recluse dwelled. And when she saw Sir Galahad ride,</a>
<a id='line_9034'>she said: God be with thee, best knight of the world. Ah certes, said</a>
<a id='line_9035'>she, all aloud that Launcelot and Percivale might hear it: An yonder</a>
<a id='line_9036'>two knights had known thee as well as I do they would not have</a>
<a id='line_9037'>encountered with thee. Then Sir Galahad heard her say so he was adread</a>
<a id='line_9038'>to be known: therewith he smote his horse with his spurs and rode a</a>
<a id='line_9039'>great pace froward them. Then perceived they both that he was Galahad;</a>
<a id='line_9040'>and up they gat on their horses, and rode fast after him, but in a</a>
<a id='line_9041'>while he was out of their sight. And then they turned again with heavy</a>
<a id='line_9042'>cheer. Let us spere some tidings, said Percivale, at yonder recluse. Do</a>
<a id='line_9043'>as ye list, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_9044'></a>
<a id='line_9045'>When Sir Percivale came to the recluse she knew him well enough, and</a>
<a id='line_9046'>Sir Launcelot both. But Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a</a>
<a id='line_9047'>wild forest, and held no path but as wild adventure led him. And at the</a>
<a id='line_9048'>last he came to a stony cross which departed two ways in waste land;</a>
<a id='line_9049'>and by the cross was a stone that was of marble, but it was so dark</a>
<a id='line_9050'>that Sir Launcelot might not wit what it was. Then Sir Launcelot looked</a>
<a id='line_9051'>by him, and saw an old chapel, and there he weened to have found</a>
<a id='line_9052'>people; and Sir Launcelot tied his horse till a tree, and there he did</a>
<a id='line_9053'>off his shield and hung it upon a tree, and then went to the chapel</a>
<a id='line_9054'>door, and found it waste and broken. And within he found a fair altar,</a>
<a id='line_9055'>full richly arrayed with cloth of clean silk, and there stood a fair</a>
<a id='line_9056'>clean candlestick, which bare six great candles, and the candlestick</a>
<a id='line_9057'>was of silver. And when Sir Launcelot saw this light he had great will</a>
<a id='line_9058'>for to enter into the chapel, but he could find no place where he might</a>
<a id='line_9059'>enter; then was he passing heavy and dismayed. Then he returned and</a>
<a id='line_9060'>came to his horse and did off his saddle and bridle, and let him</a>
<a id='line_9061'>pasture, and unlaced his helm, and ungirt his sword, and laid him down</a>
<a id='line_9062'>to sleep upon his shield to-fore the cross.</a>
<a id='line_9063'></a>
<a id='line_9064'></a>
<a id='line_9065'></a>
<a id='line_9066'></a>
<a id='line_9067'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot, half sleeping and half waking, saw a</a>
<a id='line_9068'>sick man borne in a litter, and how he was healed with the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_9069'></a>
<a id='line_9070'></a>
<a id='line_9071'>And so he fell asleep; and half waking and sleeping he saw come by him</a>
<a id='line_9072'>two palfreys all fair and white, the which bare a litter, therein lying</a>
<a id='line_9073'>a sick knight. And when he was nigh the cross he there abode still. All</a>
<a id='line_9074'>this Sir Launcelot saw and beheld, for he slept not verily; and he</a>
<a id='line_9075'>heard him say: O sweet Lord, when shall this sorrow leave me? and when</a>
<a id='line_9076'>shall the holy vessel come by me, wherethrough I shall be blessed? For</a>
<a id='line_9077'>I have endured thus long, for little trespass. A full great while</a>
<a id='line_9078'>complained the knight thus, and always Sir Launcelot heard it. With</a>
<a id='line_9079'>that Sir Launcelot saw the candlestick with the six tapers come before</a>
<a id='line_9080'>the cross, and he saw nobody that brought it. Also there came a table</a>
<a id='line_9081'>of silver, and the holy vessel of the Sangreal, which Launcelot had</a>
<a id='line_9082'>seen aforetime in King Pescheour’s house. And therewith the sick knight</a>
<a id='line_9083'>set him up, and held up both his hands, and said: Fair sweet Lord,</a>
<a id='line_9084'>which is here within this holy vessel; take heed unto me that I may be</a>
<a id='line_9085'>whole of this malady. And therewith on his hands and on his knees he</a>
<a id='line_9086'>went so nigh that he touched the holy vessel and kissed it, and anon he</a>
<a id='line_9087'>was whole; and then he said: Lord God, I thank thee, for I am healed of</a>
<a id='line_9088'>this sickness.</a>
<a id='line_9089'></a>
<a id='line_9090'>So when the holy vessel had been there a great while it went unto the</a>
<a id='line_9091'>chapel with the chandelier and the light, so that Launcelot wist not</a>
<a id='line_9092'>where it was become; for he was overtaken with sin that he had no power</a>
<a id='line_9093'>to rise again the holy vessel; wherefore after that many men said of</a>
<a id='line_9094'>him shame, but he took repentance after that. Then the sick knight</a>
<a id='line_9095'>dressed him up and kissed the cross; anon his squire brought him his</a>
<a id='line_9096'>arms, and asked his lord how he did. Certes, said he, I thank God right</a>
<a id='line_9097'>well, through the holy vessel I am healed. But I have marvel of this</a>
<a id='line_9098'>sleeping knight that had no power to awake when this holy vessel was</a>
<a id='line_9099'>brought hither. I dare right well say, said the squire, that he</a>
<a id='line_9100'>dwelleth in some deadly sin whereof he was never confessed. By my</a>
<a id='line_9101'>faith, said the knight, whatsomever he be he is unhappy, for as I deem</a>
<a id='line_9102'>he is of the fellowship of the Round Table, the which is entered into</a>
<a id='line_9103'>the quest of the Sangreal. Sir, said the squire, here I have brought</a>
<a id='line_9104'>you all your arms save your helm and your sword, and therefore by mine</a>
<a id='line_9105'>assent now may ye take this knight’s helm and his sword: and so he did.</a>
<a id='line_9106'>And when he was clean armed he took Sir Launcelot’s horse, for he was</a>
<a id='line_9107'>better than his; and so departed they from the cross.</a>
<a id='line_9108'></a>
<a id='line_9109'></a>
<a id='line_9110'></a>
<a id='line_9111'></a>
<a id='line_9112'>CHAPTER XIX. How a voice spake to Sir Launcelot, and how he found his</a>
<a id='line_9113'>horse and his helm borne away, and after went afoot.</a>
<a id='line_9114'></a>
<a id='line_9115'></a>
<a id='line_9116'>Then anon Sir Launcelot waked, and set him up, and bethought him what</a>
<a id='line_9117'>he had seen there, and whether it were dreams or not. Right so heard he</a>
<a id='line_9118'>a voice that said: Sir Launcelot, more harder than is the stone, and</a>
<a id='line_9119'>more bitter than is the wood, and more naked and barer than is the leaf</a>
<a id='line_9120'>of the fig tree; therefore go thou from hence, and withdraw thee from</a>
<a id='line_9121'>this holy place. And when Sir Launcelot heard this he was passing heavy</a>
<a id='line_9122'>and wist not what to do, and so departed sore weeping, and cursed the</a>
<a id='line_9123'>time that he was born. For then he deemed never to have had worship</a>
<a id='line_9124'>more. For those words went to his heart, till that he knew wherefore he</a>
<a id='line_9125'>was called so. Then Sir Launcelot went to the cross and found his helm,</a>
<a id='line_9126'>his sword, and his horse taken away. And then he called himself a very</a>
<a id='line_9127'>wretch, and most unhappy of all knights; and there he said: My sin and</a>
<a id='line_9128'>my wickedness have brought me unto great dishonour. For when I sought</a>
<a id='line_9129'>worldly adventures for worldly desires, I ever enchieved them and had</a>
<a id='line_9130'>the better in every place, and never was I discomfit in no quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_9131'>were it right or wrong. And now I take upon me the adventures of holy</a>
<a id='line_9132'>things, and now I see and understand that mine old sin hindereth me and</a>
<a id='line_9133'>shameth me, so that I had no power to stir nor speak when the holy</a>
<a id='line_9134'>blood appeared afore me. So thus he sorrowed till it was day, and heard</a>
<a id='line_9135'>the fowls sing: then somewhat he was comforted. But when Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_9136'>missed his horse and his harness then he wist well God was displeased</a>
<a id='line_9137'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_9138'></a>
<a id='line_9139'>Then he departed from the cross on foot into a forest; and so by prime</a>
<a id='line_9140'>he came to an high hill, and found an hermitage and a hermit therein</a>
<a id='line_9141'>which was going unto mass. And then Launcelot kneeled down and cried on</a>
<a id='line_9142'>Our Lord mercy for his wicked works. So when mass was done Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_9143'>called him, and prayed him for charity for to hear his life. With a</a>
<a id='line_9144'>good will, said the good man. Sir, said he, be ye of King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_9145'>court and of the fellowship of the Round Table? Yea forsooth, and my</a>
<a id='line_9146'>name is Sir Launcelot du Lake that hath been right well said of, and</a>
<a id='line_9147'>now my good fortune is changed, for I am the most wretch of the world.</a>
<a id='line_9148'>The hermit beheld him and had marvel how he was so abashed. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_9149'>the hermit, ye ought to thank God more than any knight living, for He</a>
<a id='line_9150'>hath caused you to have more worldly worship than any knight that now</a>
<a id='line_9151'>liveth. And for your presumption to take upon you in deadly sin for to</a>
<a id='line_9152'>be in His presence, where His flesh and His blood was, that caused you</a>
<a id='line_9153'>ye might not see it with worldly eyes; for He will not appear where</a>
<a id='line_9154'>such sinners be, but if it be unto their great hurt and unto their</a>
<a id='line_9155'>great shame; and there is no knight living now that ought to give God</a>
<a id='line_9156'>so great thank as ye, for He hath given you beauty, seemliness, and</a>
<a id='line_9157'>great strength above all other knights; and therefore ye are the more</a>
<a id='line_9158'>beholding unto God than any other man, to love Him and dread Him, for</a>
<a id='line_9159'>your strength and manhood will little avail you an God be against you.</a>

<a id='line_9164'>CHAPTER XX. How Sir Launcelot was shriven, and what sorrow he made and</a>
<a id='line_9165'>of the good ensamples which were shewed him.</a>
<a id='line_9166'></a>
<a id='line_9167'></a>
<a id='line_9168'>Then Sir Launcelot wept with heavy cheer, and said: Now I know well ye</a>
<a id='line_9169'>say me sooth. Sir, said the good man, hide none old sin from me. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_9170'>said Sir Launcelot, that were me full loath to discover. For this</a>
<a id='line_9171'>fourteen year I never discovered one thing that I have used, and that</a>
<a id='line_9172'>may I now wite my shame and my disadventure. And then he told there</a>
<a id='line_9173'>that good man all his life. And how he had loved a queen unmeasurably</a>
<a id='line_9174'>and out of measure long. And all my great deeds of arms that I have</a>
<a id='line_9175'>done, I did for the most part for the queen’s sake, and for her sake</a>
<a id='line_9176'>would I do battle were it right or wrong, and never did I battle all</a>
<a id='line_9177'>only for God’s sake, but for to win worship and to cause me to be the</a>
<a id='line_9178'>better beloved and little or nought I thanked God of it. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9179'>Launcelot said: I pray you counsel me. I will counsel you, said the</a>
<a id='line_9180'>hermit, if ye will ensure me that ye will never come in that queen’s</a>
<a id='line_9181'>fellowship as much as ye may forbear. And then Sir Launcelot promised</a>
<a id='line_9182'>him he nold, by the faith of his body. Look that your heart and your</a>
<a id='line_9183'>mouth accord, said the good man, and I shall ensure you ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_9184'>more worship than ever ye had.</a>
<a id='line_9185'></a>
<a id='line_9186'>Holy father, said Sir Launcelot, I marvel of the voice that said to me</a>
<a id='line_9187'>marvellous words, as ye have heard to-forehand. Have ye no marvel, said</a>
<a id='line_9188'>the good man thereof, for it seemeth well God loveth you; for men may</a>
<a id='line_9189'>understand a stone is hard of kind, and namely one more than another;</a>
<a id='line_9190'>and that is to understand by thee, Sir Launcelot, for thou wilt not</a>
<a id='line_9191'>leave thy sin for no goodness that God hath sent thee; therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_9192'>art more than any stone, and never wouldst thou be made nesh nor by</a>
<a id='line_9193'>water nor by fire, and that is the heat of the Holy Ghost may not enter</a>
<a id='line_9194'>in thee. Now take heed, in all the world men shall not find one knight</a>
<a id='line_9195'>to whom Our Lord hath given so much of grace as He hath given you, for</a>
<a id='line_9196'>He hath given you fairness with seemliness, He hath given thee wit,</a>
<a id='line_9197'>discretion to know good from evil, He hath given thee prowess and</a>
<a id='line_9198'>hardiness, and given thee to work so largely that thou hast had at all</a>
<a id='line_9199'>days the better wheresomever thou came; and now Our Lord will suffer</a>
<a id='line_9200'>thee no longer, but that thou shalt know Him whether thou wilt or nylt.</a>
<a id='line_9201'>And why the voice called thee bitterer than wood, for where overmuch</a>
<a id='line_9202'>sin dwelleth, there may be but little sweetness, wherefore thou art</a>
<a id='line_9203'>likened to an old rotten tree.</a>
<a id='line_9204'></a>
<a id='line_9205'>Now have I shewed thee why thou art harder than the stone and bitterer</a>
<a id='line_9206'>than the tree. Now shall I shew thee why thou art more naked and barer</a>
<a id='line_9207'>than the fig tree. It befell that Our Lord on Palm Sunday preached in</a>
<a id='line_9208'>Jerusalem, and there He found in the people that all hardness was</a>
<a id='line_9209'>harboured in them, and there He found in all the town not one that</a>
<a id='line_9210'>would harbour him. And then He went without the town, and found in</a>
<a id='line_9211'>midst of the way a fig tree, the which was right fair and well</a>
<a id='line_9212'>garnished of leaves, but fruit had it none. Then Our Lord cursed the</a>
<a id='line_9213'>tree that bare no fruit; that betokeneth the fig tree unto Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_9214'>that had leaves and no fruit. So thou, Sir Launcelot, when the Holy</a>
<a id='line_9215'>Grail was brought afore thee, He found in thee no fruit, nor good</a>
<a id='line_9216'>thought nor good will, and defouled with lechery. Certes, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9217'>Launcelot, all that you have said is true, and from henceforward I cast</a>
<a id='line_9218'>me, by the grace of God, never to be so wicked as I have been, but as</a>
<a id='line_9219'>to follow knighthood and to do feats of arms.</a>
<a id='line_9220'></a>
<a id='line_9221'>Then the good man enjoined Sir Launcelot such penance as he might do</a>
<a id='line_9222'>and to sewe knighthood, and so assoiled him, and prayed Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_9223'>to abide with him all that day. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, for I</a>
<a id='line_9224'>have neither helm, nor horse, nor sword. As for that, said the good</a>
<a id='line_9225'>man, I shall help you or to-morn at even of an horse, and all that</a>
<a id='line_9226'>longed unto you. And then Sir Launcelot repented him greatly.</a>

<a id='line_9239'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Percivale came to a recluse and asked counsel, and</a>
<a id='line_9240'>how she told him that she was his aunt.</a>
<a id='line_9241'></a>
<a id='line_9242'></a>
<a id='line_9243'>Now saith the tale, that when Sir Launcelot was ridden after Sir</a>
<a id='line_9244'>Galahad, the which had all these adventures above said, Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_9245'>turned again unto the recluse, where he deemed to have tidings of that</a>
<a id='line_9246'>knight that Launcelot followed. And so he kneeled at her window, and</a>
<a id='line_9247'>the recluse opened it and asked Sir Percivale what he would. Madam, he</a>
<a id='line_9248'>said, I am a knight of King Arthur’s court, and my name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_9249'>Percivale de Galis. When the recluse heard his name she had great joy</a>
<a id='line_9250'>of him, for mickle she had loved him to-fore any other knight, for she</a>
<a id='line_9251'>ought to do so, for she was his aunt. And then she commanded the gates</a>
<a id='line_9252'>to be opened, and there he had all the cheer that she might make him,</a>
<a id='line_9253'>and all that was in her power was at his commandment.</a>
<a id='line_9254'></a>
<a id='line_9255'>So on the morn Sir Percivale went to the recluse and asked her if she</a>
<a id='line_9256'>knew that knight with the white shield. Sir, said she, why would ye</a>
<a id='line_9257'>wit? Truly, madam, said Sir Percivale, I shall never be well at ease</a>
<a id='line_9258'>till that I know of that knight’s fellowship, and that I may fight with</a>
<a id='line_9259'>him, for I may not leave him so lightly, for I have the shame yet. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_9260'>Percivale, said she, would ye fight with him? I see well ye have great</a>
<a id='line_9261'>will to be slain as your father was, through outrageousness. Madam,</a>
<a id='line_9262'>said Sir Percivale, it seemeth by your words that ye know me. Yea, said</a>
<a id='line_9263'>she, I well ought to know you, for I am your aunt, although I be in a</a>
<a id='line_9264'>priory place. For some called me sometime the Queen of the Waste Lands,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>and I was called the queen of most riches in the world; and it pleased</a>
<a id='line_9266'>me never my riches so much as doth my poverty. Then Sir Percivale wept</a>
<a id='line_9267'>for very pity when that he knew it was his aunt. Ah, fair nephew, said</a>
<a id='line_9268'>she, when heard ye tidings of your mother? Truly, said he, I heard none</a>
<a id='line_9269'>of her, but I dream of her much in my sleep; and therefore I wot not</a>
<a id='line_9270'>whether she be dead or alive. Certes, fair nephew, said she, your</a>
<a id='line_9271'>mother is dead, for after your departing from her she took such a</a>
<a id='line_9272'>sorrow that anon, after she was confessed, she died. Now, God have</a>
<a id='line_9273'>mercy on her soul, said Sir Percivale, it sore forthinketh me; but all</a>
<a id='line_9274'>we must change the life. Now, fair aunt, tell me what is the knight? I</a>
<a id='line_9275'>deem it be he that bare the red arms on Whitsunday. Wit you well, said</a>
<a id='line_9276'>she, that this is he, for otherwise ought he not to do, but to go in</a>
<a id='line_9277'>red arms; and that same knight hath no peer, for he worketh all by</a>
<a id='line_9278'>miracle, and he shall never be overcome of none earthly man’s hand.</a>

<a id='line_9284'>the knights that should achieve the Sangreal should be known.</a>
<a id='line_9285'></a>
<a id='line_9286'></a>
<a id='line_9287'>Also Merlin made the Round Table in tokening of roundness of the world,</a>
<a id='line_9288'>for by the Round Table is the world signified by right, for all the</a>
<a id='line_9289'>world, Christian and heathen, repair unto the Round Table; and when</a>
<a id='line_9290'>they are chosen to be of the fellowship of the Round Table they think</a>
<a id='line_9291'>them more blessed and more in worship than if they had gotten half the</a>
<a id='line_9292'>world; and ye have seen that they have lost their fathers and their</a>
<a id='line_9293'>mothers, and all their kin, and their wives and their children, for to</a>
<a id='line_9294'>be of your fellowship. It is well seen by you; for since ye have</a>
<a id='line_9295'>departed from your mother ye would never see her, ye found such</a>
<a id='line_9296'>fellowship at the Round Table. When Merlin had ordained the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_9297'>he said, by them which should be fellows of the Round Table the truth</a>
<a id='line_9298'>of the Sangreal should be well known. And men asked him how men might</a>
<a id='line_9299'>know them that should best do and to enchieve the Sangreal? Then he</a>
<a id='line_9300'>said there should be three white bulls that should enchieve it, and the</a>
<a id='line_9301'>two should be maidens, and the third should be chaste. And that one of</a>
<a id='line_9302'>the three should pass his father as much as the lion passeth the</a>
<a id='line_9303'>leopard, both of strength and hardiness.</a>
<a id='line_9304'></a>
<a id='line_9305'>They that heard Merlin say so said thus unto Merlin: Sithen there shall</a>
<a id='line_9306'>be such a knight, thou shouldest ordain by thy crafts a siege, that no</a>
<a id='line_9307'>man should sit in it but he all only that shall pass all other knights.</a>
<a id='line_9308'>Then Merlin answered that he would do so. And then he made the Siege</a>
<a id='line_9309'>Perilous, in the which Galahad sat in at his meat on Whitsunday last</a>
<a id='line_9310'>past. Now, madam, said Sir Percivale, so much have I heard of you that</a>
<a id='line_9311'>by my good will I will never have ado with Sir Galahad but by way of</a>
<a id='line_9312'>kindness; and for God’s love, fair aunt, can ye teach me some way where</a>
<a id='line_9313'>I may find him? for much would I love the fellowship of him. Fair</a>
<a id='line_9314'>nephew, said she, ye must ride unto a castle the which is called</a>
<a id='line_9315'>Goothe, where he hath a cousin-germain, and there may ye be lodged this</a>
<a id='line_9316'>night. And as he teacheth you, seweth after as fast as ye can; and if</a>
<a id='line_9317'>he can tell you no tidings of him, ride straight unto the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_9318'>Carbonek, where the maimed king is there lying, for there shall ye hear</a>
<a id='line_9319'>true tidings of him.</a>

<a id='line_9324'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Percivale came into a monastery, where he found</a>
<a id='line_9325'>King Evelake, which was an old man.</a>
<a id='line_9326'></a>
<a id='line_9327'></a>
<a id='line_9328'>Then departed Sir Percivale from his aunt, either making great sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_9329'>And so he rode till evensong time. And then he heard a clock smite; and</a>
<a id='line_9330'>then he was ware of an house closed well with walls and deep ditches,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>and there he knocked at the gate and was let in, and he alighted and</a>
<a id='line_9332'>was led unto a chamber, and soon he was unarmed. And there he had right</a>
<a id='line_9333'>good cheer all that night; and on the morn he heard his mass, and in</a>
<a id='line_9334'>the monastery he found a priest ready at the altar. And on the right</a>
<a id='line_9335'>side he saw a pew closed with iron, and behind the altar he saw a rich</a>
<a id='line_9336'>bed and a fair, as of cloth of silk and gold.</a>
<a id='line_9337'></a>
<a id='line_9338'>Then Sir Percivale espied that therein was a man or a woman, for the</a>
<a id='line_9339'>visage was covered; then he left off his looking and heard his service.</a>
<a id='line_9340'>And when it came to the sacring, he that lay within that parclos</a>
<a id='line_9341'>dressed him up, and uncovered his head; and then him beseemed a passing</a>
<a id='line_9342'>old man, and he had a crown of gold upon his head, and his shoulders</a>
<a id='line_9343'>were naked and unhilled unto his navel. And then Sir Percivale espied</a>
<a id='line_9344'>his body was full of great wounds, both on the shoulders, arms, and</a>
<a id='line_9345'>visage. And ever he held up his hands against Our Lord’s body, and</a>
<a id='line_9346'>cried: Fair, sweet Father, Jesu Christ, forget not me. And so he lay</a>
<a id='line_9347'>down, but always he was in his prayers and orisons; and him seemed to</a>
<a id='line_9348'>be of the age of three hundred winter. And when the mass was done the</a>
<a id='line_9349'>priest took Our Lord’s body and bare it to the sick king. And when he</a>
<a id='line_9350'>had used it he did off his crown, and commanded the crown to be set on</a>
<a id='line_9351'>the altar.</a>
<a id='line_9352'></a>
<a id='line_9353'>Then Sir Percivale asked one of the brethren what he was. Sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_9354'>good man, ye have heard much of Joseph of Aramathie, how he was sent by</a>
<a id='line_9355'>Jesu Christ into this land for to teach and preach the holy Christian</a>
<a id='line_9356'>faith; and therefore he suffered many persecutions the which the</a>
<a id='line_9357'>enemies of Christ did unto him, and in the city of Sarras he converted</a>
<a id='line_9358'>a king whose name was Evelake. And so this king came with Joseph into</a>
<a id='line_9359'>this land, and ever he was busy to be thereas the Sangreal was; and on</a>
<a id='line_9360'>a time he nighed it so nigh that Our Lord was displeased with him, but</a>
<a id='line_9361'>ever he followed it more and more, till God struck him almost blind.</a>
<a id='line_9362'>Then this king cried mercy, and said: Fair Lord, let me never die till</a>
<a id='line_9363'>the good knight of my blood of the ninth degree be come, that I may see</a>
<a id='line_9364'>him openly that he shall enchieve the Sangreal, that I may kiss him.</a>
<a id='line_9365'></a>
<a id='line_9366'></a>
<a id='line_9367'></a>
<a id='line_9368'></a>
<a id='line_9369'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Percivale saw many men of arms bearing a dead</a>
<a id='line_9370'>knight, and how he fought against them.</a>
<a id='line_9371'></a>
<a id='line_9372'></a>
<a id='line_9373'>When the king thus had made his prayers he heard a voice that said:</a>
<a id='line_9374'>Heard be thy prayers, for thou shalt not die till he have kissed thee.</a>
<a id='line_9375'>And when that knight shall come the clearness of your eyes shall come</a>
<a id='line_9376'>again, and thou shalt see openly, and thy wounds shall be healed, and</a>
<a id='line_9377'>erst shall they never close. And this befell of King Evelake, and this</a>
<a id='line_9378'>same king hath lived this three hundred winters this holy life, and men</a>
<a id='line_9379'>say the knight is in the court that shall heal him. Sir, said the good</a>
<a id='line_9380'>man, I pray you tell me what knight that ye be, and if ye be of King</a>
<a id='line_9381'>Arthur’s court and of the Table Round. Yea forsooth, said he, and my</a>
<a id='line_9382'>name is Sir Percivale de Galis. And when the good man understood his</a>
<a id='line_9383'>name he made great joy of him.</a>
<a id='line_9384'></a>
<a id='line_9385'>And then Sir Percivale departed and rode till the hour of noon. And he</a>
<a id='line_9386'>met in a valley about a twenty men of arms, which bare in a bier a</a>
<a id='line_9387'>knight deadly slain. And when they saw Sir Percivale they asked him of</a>
<a id='line_9388'>whence he was. And he answered: Of the court of King Arthur. Then they</a>
<a id='line_9389'>cried all at once: Slay him. Then Sir Percivale smote the first to the</a>
<a id='line_9390'>earth and his horse upon him. And then seven of the knights smote upon</a>
<a id='line_9391'>his shield all at once, and the remnant slew his horse so that he fell</a>
<a id='line_9392'>to the earth. So had they slain him or taken him had not the good</a>
<a id='line_9393'>knight, Sir Galahad, with the red arms come there by adventure into</a>
<a id='line_9394'>those parts. And when he saw all those knights upon one knight he</a>
<a id='line_9395'>cried: Save me that knight’s life. And then he dressed him toward the</a>
<a id='line_9396'>twenty men of arms as fast as his horse might drive, with his spear in</a>
<a id='line_9397'>the rest, and smote the foremost horse and man to the earth. And when</a>
<a id='line_9398'>his spear was broken he set his hand to his sword, and smote on the</a>
<a id='line_9399'>right hand and on the left hand that it was marvel to see, and at every</a>
<a id='line_9400'>stroke he smote one down or put him to a rebuke, so that they would</a>
<a id='line_9401'>fight no more but fled to a thick forest, and Sir Galahad followed</a>
<a id='line_9402'>them.</a>
<a id='line_9403'></a>
<a id='line_9404'>And when Sir Percivale saw him chase them so, he made great sorrow that</a>
<a id='line_9405'>his horse was away. And then he wist well it was Sir Galahad. And then</a>
<a id='line_9406'>he cried aloud: Ah fair knight, abide and suffer me to do thankings</a>
<a id='line_9407'>unto thee, for much have ye done for me. But ever Sir Galahad rode so</a>
<a id='line_9408'>fast that at the last he passed out of his sight. And as fast as Sir</a>
<a id='line_9409'>Percivale might he went after him on foot, crying. And then he met with</a>
<a id='line_9410'>a yeoman riding upon an hackney, the which led in his hand a great</a>
<a id='line_9411'>steed blacker than any bear. Ah, fair friend, said Sir Percivale, as</a>
<a id='line_9412'>ever I may do for you, and to be your true knight in the first place ye</a>
<a id='line_9413'>will require me, that ye will lend me that black steed, that I might</a>
<a id='line_9414'>overtake a knight the which rideth afore me. Sir knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_9415'>yeoman, I pray you hold me excused of that, for that I may not do. For</a>
<a id='line_9416'>wit ye well, the horse is such a man’s horse, that an I lent it you or</a>
<a id='line_9417'>any man, that he would slay me. Alas, said Sir Percivale, I had never</a>
<a id='line_9418'>so great sorrow as I have had for losing of yonder knight. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_9419'>the yeoman, I am right heavy for you, for a good horse would beseem you</a>
<a id='line_9420'>well; but I dare not deliver you this horse but if ye would take him</a>
<a id='line_9421'>from me. That will I not do, said Sir Percivale. And so they departed;</a>
<a id='line_9422'>and Sir Percivale set him down under a tree, and made sorrow out of</a>
<a id='line_9423'>measure. And as he was there, there came a knight riding on the horse</a>
<a id='line_9424'>that the yeoman led, and he was clean armed.</a>
<a id='line_9425'></a>
<a id='line_9426'></a>

<a id='line_9429'>CHAPTER V. How a yeoman desired him to get again an horse, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_9430'>Percivale’s hackney was slain, and how he gat an horse.</a>
<a id='line_9431'></a>
<a id='line_9432'></a>
<a id='line_9433'>And anon the yeoman came pricking after as fast as ever he might, and</a>
<a id='line_9434'>asked Sir Percivale if he saw any knight riding on his black steed.</a>
<a id='line_9435'>Yea, sir, forsooth, said he; why, sir, ask ye me that? Ah, sir, that</a>
<a id='line_9436'>steed he hath benome me with strength; wherefore my lord will slay me</a>
<a id='line_9437'>in what place he findeth me. Well, said Sir Percivale, what wouldst</a>
<a id='line_9438'>thou that I did? Thou seest well that I am on foot, but an I had a good</a>
<a id='line_9439'>horse I should bring him soon again. Sir, said the yeoman, take mine</a>
<a id='line_9440'>hackney and do the best ye can, and I shall sewe you on foot to wit how</a>
<a id='line_9441'>that ye shall speed. Then Sir Percivale alighted upon that hackney, and</a>
<a id='line_9442'>rode as fast as he might, and at the last he saw that knight. And then</a>
<a id='line_9443'>he cried: Knight, turn again; and he turned and set his spear against</a>
<a id='line_9444'>Sir Percivale, and he smote the hackney in the midst of the breast that</a>
<a id='line_9445'>he fell down dead to the earth, and there he had a great fall, and the</a>
<a id='line_9446'>other rode his way. And then Sir Percivale was wood wroth, and cried:</a>
<a id='line_9447'>Abide, wicked knight; coward and false-hearted knight, turn again and</a>
<a id='line_9448'>fight with me on foot. But he answered not, but passed on his way.</a>
<a id='line_9449'></a>
<a id='line_9450'>When Sir Percivale saw he would not turn he cast away his helm and</a>
<a id='line_9451'>sword, and said: Now am I a very wretch, cursed and most unhappy above</a>
<a id='line_9452'>all other knights. So in this sorrow he abode all that day till it was</a>
<a id='line_9453'>night; and then he was faint, and laid him down and slept till it was</a>
<a id='line_9454'>midnight; and then he awaked and saw afore him a woman which said unto</a>
<a id='line_9455'>him right fiercely: Sir Percivale, what dost thou here? He answered, I</a>
<a id='line_9456'>do neither good nor great ill. If thou wilt ensure me, said she, that</a>
<a id='line_9457'>thou wilt fulfil my will when I summon thee, I shall lend thee mine own</a>
<a id='line_9458'>horse which shall bear thee whither thou wilt. Sir Percivale was glad</a>
<a id='line_9459'>of her proffer, and ensured her to fulfil all her desire. Then abide me</a>
<a id='line_9460'>here, and I shall go and fetch you an horse. And so she came soon again</a>
<a id='line_9461'>and brought an horse with her that was inly black. When Percivale</a>
<a id='line_9462'>beheld that horse he marvelled that it was so great and so well</a>
<a id='line_9463'>apparelled; and not for then he was so hardy, and he leapt upon him,</a>
<a id='line_9464'>and took none heed of himself. And so anon as he was upon him he thrust</a>
<a id='line_9465'>to him with his spurs, and so he rode by a forest, and the moon shone</a>
<a id='line_9466'>clear. And within an hour and less he bare him four days’ journey</a>
<a id='line_9467'>thence, until he came to a rough water the which roared, and his horse</a>
<a id='line_9468'>would have borne him into it.</a>
<a id='line_9469'></a>
<a id='line_9470'></a>
<a id='line_9471'></a>
<a id='line_9472'></a>
<a id='line_9473'>CHAPTER VI. Of the great danger that Sir Percivale was in by his horse,</a>
<a id='line_9474'>and how he saw a serpent and a lion fight.</a>
<a id='line_9475'></a>
<a id='line_9476'></a>
<a id='line_9477'>And when Sir Percivale came nigh the brim, and saw the water so</a>
<a id='line_9478'>boistous, he doubted to overpass it. And then he made a sign of the</a>
<a id='line_9479'>cross in his forehead. When the fiend felt him so charged he shook off</a>
<a id='line_9480'>Sir Percivale, and he went into the water crying and roaring, making</a>
<a id='line_9481'>great sorrow, and it seemed unto him that the water brent. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9482'>Percivale perceived it was a fiend, the which would have brought him</a>
<a id='line_9483'>unto his perdition. Then he commended himself unto God, and prayed Our</a>
<a id='line_9484'>Lord to keep him from all such temptations; and so he prayed all that</a>
<a id='line_9485'>night till on the morn that it was day; then he saw that he was in a</a>
<a id='line_9486'>wild mountain the which was closed with the sea nigh all about, that he</a>
<a id='line_9487'>might see no land about him which might relieve him, but wild beasts.</a>
<a id='line_9488'></a>
<a id='line_9489'>And then he went into a valley, and there he saw a young serpent bring</a>
<a id='line_9490'>a young lion by the neck, and so he came by Sir Percivale. With that</a>
<a id='line_9491'>came a great lion crying and roaring after the serpent. And as fast as</a>
<a id='line_9492'>Sir Percivale saw this he marvelled, and hied him thither, but anon the</a>
<a id='line_9493'>lion had overtaken the serpent and began battle with him. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9494'>Percivale thought to help the lion, for he was the more natural beast</a>
<a id='line_9495'>of the two; and therewith he drew his sword, and set his shield afore</a>
<a id='line_9496'>him, and there he gave the serpent such a buffet that he had a deadly</a>
<a id='line_9497'>wound. When the lion saw that, he made no resemblaunt to fight with</a>
<a id='line_9498'>him, but made him all the cheer that a beast might make a man. Then</a>
<a id='line_9499'>Percivale perceived that, and cast down his shield which was broken;</a>
<a id='line_9500'>and then he did off his helm for to gather wind, for he was greatly</a>
<a id='line_9501'>enchafed with the serpent: and the lion went alway about him fawning as</a>
<a id='line_9502'>a spaniel. And then he stroked him on the neck and on the shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_9503'>And then he thanked God of the fellowship of that beast. And about noon</a>
<a id='line_9504'>the lion took his little whelp and trussed him and bare him there he</a>
<a id='line_9505'>came from.</a>
<a id='line_9506'></a>
<a id='line_9507'>Then was Sir Percivale alone. And as the tale telleth, he was one of</a>
<a id='line_9508'>the men of the world at that time which most believed in Our Lord Jesu</a>
<a id='line_9509'>Christ, for in those days there were but few folks that believed in God</a>
<a id='line_9510'>perfectly. For in those days the son spared not the father no more than</a>
<a id='line_9511'>a stranger. And so Sir Percivale comforted himself in our Lord Jesu,</a>
<a id='line_9512'>and besought God no temptation should bring him out of God’s service,</a>
<a id='line_9513'>but to endure as his true champion. Thus when Sir Percivale had prayed</a>
<a id='line_9514'>he saw the lion come toward him, and then he couched down at his feet.</a>
<a id='line_9515'>And so all that night the lion and he slept together; and when Sir</a>
<a id='line_9516'>Percivale slept he dreamed a marvellous dream, that there two ladies</a>
<a id='line_9517'>met with him, and that one sat upon a lion, and that other sat upon a</a>
<a id='line_9518'>serpent, and that one of them was young, and the other was old; and the</a>
<a id='line_9519'>youngest him thought said: Sir Percivale, my lord saluteth thee, and</a>
<a id='line_9520'>sendeth thee word that thou array thee and make thee ready, for to-morn</a>
<a id='line_9521'>thou must fight with the strongest champion of the world. And if thou</a>
<a id='line_9522'>be overcome thou shall not be quit for losing of any of thy members,</a>
<a id='line_9523'>but thou shalt be shamed for ever to the world’s end. And then he asked</a>
<a id='line_9524'>her what was her lord. And she said the greatest lord of all the world:</a>
<a id='line_9525'>and so she departed suddenly that he wist not where.</a>
<a id='line_9526'></a>
<a id='line_9527'></a>
<a id='line_9528'></a>
<a id='line_9529'></a>
<a id='line_9530'>CHAPTER VII. Of the vision that Sir Percivale saw, and how his vision</a>
<a id='line_9531'>was expounded, and of his lion.</a>
<a id='line_9532'></a>
<a id='line_9533'></a>
<a id='line_9534'>Then came forth the other lady that rode upon the serpent, and she</a>
<a id='line_9535'>said: Sir Percivale, I complain me of you that ye have done unto me,</a>
<a id='line_9536'>and have not offended unto you. Certes, madam, he said, unto you nor no</a>
<a id='line_9537'>lady I never offended. Yes, said she, I shall tell you why. I have</a>
<a id='line_9538'>nourished in this place a great while a serpent, which served me a</a>
<a id='line_9539'>great while, and yesterday ye slew him as he gat his prey. Say me for</a>
<a id='line_9540'>what cause ye slew him, for the lion was not yours. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9541'>Percivale, I know well the lion was not mine, but I did it for the lion</a>
<a id='line_9542'>is of more gentler nature than the serpent, and therefore I slew him;</a>
<a id='line_9543'>meseemeth I did not amiss against you. Madam, said he, what would ye</a>
<a id='line_9544'>that I did? I would, said she, for the amends of my beast that ye</a>
<a id='line_9545'>become my man. And then he answered: That will I not grant you. No,</a>
<a id='line_9546'>said she, truly ye were never but my servant sin ye received the homage</a>
<a id='line_9547'>of Our Lord Jesu Christ. Therefore, I ensure you in what place I may</a>
<a id='line_9548'>find you without keeping I shall take you, as he that sometime was my</a>
<a id='line_9549'>man. And so she departed from Sir Percivale and left him sleeping, the</a>
<a id='line_9550'>which was sore travailed of his advision. And on the morn he arose and</a>
<a id='line_9551'>blessed him, and he was passing feeble.</a>
<a id='line_9552'></a>
<a id='line_9553'>Then was Sir Percivale ware in the sea, and saw a ship come sailing</a>
<a id='line_9554'>toward him; and Sir Percivale went unto the ship and found it covered</a>
<a id='line_9555'>within and without with white samite. And at the board stood an old man</a>
<a id='line_9556'>clothed in a surplice, in likeness of a priest. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_9557'>Percivale, ye be welcome. God keep you, said the good man. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_9558'>the old man, of whence be ye? Sir, said Sir Percivale, I am of King</a>
<a id='line_9559'>Arthur’s court, and a knight of the Table Round, the which am in the</a>
<a id='line_9560'>quest of the Sangreal; and here am I in great duresse, and never like</a>
<a id='line_9561'>to escape out of this wilderness. Doubt not, said the good man, an ye</a>
<a id='line_9562'>be so true a knight as the order of chivalry requireth, and of heart as</a>
<a id='line_9563'>ye ought to be, ye should not doubt that none enemy should slay you.</a>
<a id='line_9564'>What are ye? said Sir Percivale. Sir, said the old man, I am of a</a>
<a id='line_9565'>strange country, and hither I come to comfort you.</a>
<a id='line_9566'></a>
<a id='line_9567'>Sir, said Sir Percivale, what signifieth my dream that I dreamed this</a>
<a id='line_9568'>night? And there he told him altogether: She which rode upon the lion</a>
<a id='line_9569'>betokeneth the new law of holy church, that is to understand, faith,</a>
<a id='line_9570'>good hope, belief, and baptism. For she seemed younger than the other</a>
<a id='line_9571'>it is great reason, for she was born in the resurrection and the</a>
<a id='line_9572'>passion of Our Lord Jesu Christ. And for great love she came to thee to</a>
<a id='line_9573'>warn thee of thy great battle that shall befall thee. With whom, said</a>
<a id='line_9574'>Sir Percivale, shall I fight? With the most champion of the world, said</a>
<a id='line_9575'>the old man; for as the lady said, but if thou quit thee well thou</a>
<a id='line_9576'>shalt not be quit by losing of one member, but thou shalt be shamed to</a>
<a id='line_9577'>the world’s end. And she that rode on the serpent signifieth the old</a>
<a id='line_9578'>law, and that serpent betokeneth a fiend. And why she blamed thee that</a>
<a id='line_9579'>thou slewest her servant, it betokeneth nothing; the serpent that thou</a>
<a id='line_9580'>slewest betokeneth the devil that thou rodest upon to the rock. And</a>
<a id='line_9581'>when thou madest a sign of the cross, there thou slewest him, and put</a>
<a id='line_9582'>away his power. And when she asked thee amends and to become her man,</a>
<a id='line_9583'>and thou saidst thou wouldst not, that was to make thee to believe on</a>
<a id='line_9584'>her and leave thy baptism. So he commanded Sir Percivale to depart, and</a>
<a id='line_9585'>so he leapt over the board and the ship, and all went away he wist not</a>
<a id='line_9586'>whither. Then he went up unto the rock and found the lion which always</a>
<a id='line_9587'>kept him fellowship, and he stroked him upon the back and had great joy</a>
<a id='line_9588'>of him.</a>
<a id='line_9589'></a>
<a id='line_9590'></a>
<a id='line_9591'></a>
<a id='line_9592'></a>
<a id='line_9593'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Percivale saw a ship coming to him-ward, and how</a>
<a id='line_9594'>the lady of the ship told him of her disheritance.</a>
<a id='line_9595'></a>
<a id='line_9596'></a>
<a id='line_9597'>By that Sir Percivale had abiden there till mid-day he saw a ship came</a>
<a id='line_9598'>rowing in the sea, as all the wind of the world had driven it. And so</a>
<a id='line_9599'>it drove under that rock. And when Sir Percivale saw this he hied him</a>
<a id='line_9600'>thither, and found the ship covered with silk more blacker than any</a>
<a id='line_9601'>bear, and therein was a gentlewoman of great beauty, and she was</a>
<a id='line_9602'>clothed richly that none might be better. And when she saw Sir</a>
<a id='line_9603'>Percivale she said: Who brought you in this wilderness where ye be</a>
<a id='line_9604'>never like to pass hence, for ye shall die here for hunger and</a>
<a id='line_9605'>mischief? Damosel, said Sir Percivale, I serve the best man of the</a>
<a id='line_9606'>world, and in his service he will not suffer me to die, for who that</a>
<a id='line_9607'>knocketh shall enter, and who that asketh shall have, and who that</a>
<a id='line_9608'>seeketh him he hideth him not. But then she said: Sir Percivale, wot ye</a>
<a id='line_9609'>what I am? Yea, said he. Now who taught you my name? said she. Now,</a>
<a id='line_9610'>said Sir Percivale, I know you better than ye ween. And I came out of</a>
<a id='line_9611'>the waste forest where I found the Red Knight with the white shield,</a>
<a id='line_9612'>said the damosel. Ah, damosel, said he, with that knight would I meet</a>
<a id='line_9613'>passing fain. Sir knight, said she, an ye will ensure me by the faith</a>
<a id='line_9614'>that ye owe unto knighthood that ye shall do my will what time I summon</a>
<a id='line_9615'>you, and I shall bring you unto that knight. Yea, said he, I shall</a>
<a id='line_9616'>promise you to fulfil your desire. Well, said she, now shall I tell</a>
<a id='line_9617'>you. I saw him in the forest chasing two knights unto a water, the</a>
<a id='line_9618'>which is called Mortaise; and they drove him into the water for dread</a>
<a id='line_9619'>of death, and the two knights passed over, and the Red Knight passed</a>
<a id='line_9620'>after, and there his horse was drenched, and he, through great</a>
<a id='line_9621'>strength, escaped unto the land: thus she told him, and Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_9622'>was passing glad thereof.</a>
<a id='line_9623'></a>
<a id='line_9624'>Then she asked him if he had ate any meat late. Nay, madam, truly I ate</a>
<a id='line_9625'>no meat nigh this three days, but late here I spake with a good man</a>
<a id='line_9626'>that fed me with his good words and holy, and refreshed me greatly. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_9627'>sir knight, said she, that same man is an enchanter and a multiplier of</a>
<a id='line_9628'>words. For an ye believe him ye shall plainly be shamed, and die in</a>
<a id='line_9629'>this rock for pure hunger, and be eaten with wild beasts; and ye be a</a>
<a id='line_9630'>young man and a goodly knight, and I shall help you an ye will. What</a>
<a id='line_9631'>are ye, said Sir Percivale, that proffered me thus great kindness? I</a>
<a id='line_9632'>am, said she, a gentlewoman that am disherited, which was sometime the</a>
<a id='line_9633'>richest woman of the world. Damosel, said Sir Percivale, who hath</a>
<a id='line_9634'>disherited you? for I have great pity of you. Sir, said she, I dwelled</a>
<a id='line_9635'>with the greatest man of the world, and he made me so fair and clear</a>
<a id='line_9636'>that there was none like me; and of that great beauty I had a little</a>
<a id='line_9637'>pride more than I ought to have had. Also I said a word that pleased</a>
<a id='line_9638'>him not. And then he would not suffer me to be any longer in his</a>
<a id='line_9639'>company, and so drove me from mine heritage, and so disherited me, and</a>
<a id='line_9640'>he had never pity of me nor of none of my council, nor of my court. And</a>
<a id='line_9641'>sithen, sir knight, it hath befallen me so, and through me and mine I</a>
<a id='line_9642'>have benome him many of his men, and made them to become my men. For</a>
<a id='line_9643'>they ask never nothing of me but I give it them, that and much more.</a>
<a id='line_9644'>Thus I and all my servants were against him night and day. Therefore I</a>
<a id='line_9645'>know now no good knight, nor no good man, but I get them on my side an</a>
<a id='line_9646'>I may. And for that I know that thou art a good knight, I beseech you</a>
<a id='line_9647'>to help me; and for ye be a fellow of the Round Table, wherefore ye</a>
<a id='line_9648'>ought not to fail no gentlewoman which is disherited, an she besought</a>
<a id='line_9649'>you of help.</a>
<a id='line_9650'></a>

<a id='line_9654'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Percivale promised her help, and how he required</a>
<a id='line_9655'>her of love, and how he was saved from the fiend.</a>
<a id='line_9656'></a>
<a id='line_9657'></a>
<a id='line_9658'>Then Sir Percivale promised her all the help that he might; and then</a>
<a id='line_9659'>she thanked him. And at that time the weather was hot. Then she called</a>
<a id='line_9660'>unto her a gentlewoman and bade her bring forth a pavilion; and so she</a>
<a id='line_9661'>did, and pight it upon the gravel. Sir, said she, now may ye rest you</a>
<a id='line_9662'>in this heat of the day. Then he thanked her, and she put off his helm</a>
<a id='line_9663'>and his shield, and there he slept a great while. And then he awoke and</a>
<a id='line_9664'>asked her if she had any meat, and she said: Yea, also ye shall have</a>
<a id='line_9665'>enough. And so there was set enough upon the table, and thereon so much</a>
<a id='line_9666'>that he had marvel, for there was all manner of meats that he could</a>
<a id='line_9667'>think on. Also he drank there the strongest wine that ever he drank,</a>
<a id='line_9668'>him thought, and therewith he was a little chafed more than he ought to</a>
<a id='line_9669'>be; with that he beheld the gentlewoman, and him thought she was the</a>
<a id='line_9670'>fairest creature that ever he saw. And then Sir Percivale proffered her</a>
<a id='line_9671'>love, and prayed her that she would be his. Then she refused him, in a</a>
<a id='line_9672'>manner, when he required her, for the cause he should be the more</a>
<a id='line_9673'>ardent on her, and ever he ceased not to pray her of love. And when she</a>
<a id='line_9674'>saw him well enchafed, then she said: Sir Percivale, wit you well I</a>
<a id='line_9675'>shall not fulfil your will but if ye swear from henceforth ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_9676'>my true servant, and to do nothing but that I shall command you. Will</a>
<a id='line_9677'>ye ensure me this as ye be a true knight? Yea, said he, fair lady, by</a>
<a id='line_9678'>the faith of my body. Well, said she, now shall ye do with me whatso it</a>
<a id='line_9679'>please you; and now wit ye well ye are the knight in the world that I</a>
<a id='line_9680'>have most desire to.</a>
<a id='line_9681'></a>
<a id='line_9682'>And then two squires were commanded to make a bed in midst of the</a>
<a id='line_9683'>pavilion. And anon she was unclothed and laid therein. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9684'>Percivale laid him down by her naked; and by adventure and grace he saw</a>
<a id='line_9685'>his sword lie on the ground naked, in whose pommel was a red cross and</a>
<a id='line_9686'>the sign of the crucifix therein, and bethought him on his knighthood</a>
<a id='line_9687'>and his promise made to-forehand unto the good man; then he made a sign</a>
<a id='line_9688'>of the cross in his forehead, and therewith the pavilion turned</a>
<a id='line_9689'>up-so-down, and then it changed unto a smoke, and a black cloud, and</a>
<a id='line_9690'>then he was adread and cried aloud:</a>

<a id='line_9697'></a>

<a id='line_9699'>Fair sweet Father, Jesu Christ, ne let me not be shamed, the which was</a>
<a id='line_9700'>nigh lost had not thy good grace been. And then he looked into a ship,</a>
<a id='line_9701'>and saw her enter therein, which said: Sir Percivale, ye have betrayed</a>
<a id='line_9702'>me. And so she went with the wind roaring and yelling, that it seemed</a>
<a id='line_9703'>all the water brent after her. Then Sir Percivale made great sorrow,</a>
<a id='line_9704'>and drew his sword unto him, saying: Sithen my flesh will be my master</a>
<a id='line_9705'>I shall punish it; and therewith he rove himself through the thigh that</a>
<a id='line_9706'>the blood stert about him, and said: O good Lord, take this in</a>
<a id='line_9707'>recompensation of that I have done against thee, my Lord. So then he</a>
<a id='line_9708'>clothed him and armed him, and called himself a wretch, saying: How</a>
<a id='line_9709'>nigh was I lost, and to have lost that I should never have gotten</a>
<a id='line_9710'>again, that was my virginity, for that may never be recovered after it</a>
<a id='line_9711'>is once lost. And then he stopped his bleeding wound with a piece of</a>
<a id='line_9712'>his shirt.</a>
<a id='line_9713'></a>
<a id='line_9714'>Thus as he made his moan he saw the same ship come from Orient that the</a>
<a id='line_9715'>good man was in the day afore, and the noble knight was ashamed with</a>
<a id='line_9716'>himself, and therewith he fell in a swoon. And when he awoke he went</a>
<a id='line_9717'>unto him weakly, and there he saluted this good man. And then he asked</a>
<a id='line_9718'>Sir Percivale: How hast thou done sith I departed? Sir, said he, here</a>
<a id='line_9719'>was a gentlewoman and led me into deadly sin. And there he told him</a>
<a id='line_9720'>altogether. Knew ye not the maid? said the good man. Sir, said he, nay,</a>
<a id='line_9721'>but well I wot the fiend sent her hither to shame me. O good knight,</a>
<a id='line_9722'>said he, thou art a fool, for that gentlewoman was the master fiend of</a>
<a id='line_9723'>hell, the which hath power above all devils, and that was the old lady</a>
<a id='line_9724'>that thou sawest in thine advision riding on the serpent. Then he told</a>
<a id='line_9725'>Sir Percivale how our Lord Jesu Christ beat him out of heaven for his</a>
<a id='line_9726'>sin, the which was the most brightest angel of heaven, and therefore he</a>
<a id='line_9727'>lost his heritage. And that was the champion that thou foughtest</a>
<a id='line_9728'>withal, the which had overcome thee had not the grace of God been. Now</a>
<a id='line_9729'>beware Sir Percivale, and take this for an ensample. And then the good</a>
<a id='line_9730'>man vanished away. Then Sir Percivale took his arms, and entered into</a>
<a id='line_9731'>the ship, and so departed from thence.</a>

<a id='line_9745'>a white shirt, a man of religion, of an hundred winter old.</a>
<a id='line_9746'></a>
<a id='line_9747'></a>
<a id='line_9748'>When the hermit had kept Sir Launcelot three days, the hermit gat him</a>
<a id='line_9749'>an horse, an helm, and a sword. And then he departed about the hour of</a>
<a id='line_9750'>noon. And then he saw a little house. And when he came near he saw a</a>
<a id='line_9751'>chapel, and there beside he saw an old man that was clothed all in</a>
<a id='line_9752'>white full richly; and then Sir Launcelot said: God save you. God keep</a>
<a id='line_9753'>you, said the good man, and make you a good knight. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_9754'>alighted and entered into the chapel, and there he saw an old man dead,</a>
<a id='line_9755'>in a white shirt of passing fine cloth.</a>
<a id='line_9756'></a>
<a id='line_9757'>Sir, said the good man, this man that is dead ought not to be in such</a>
<a id='line_9758'>clothing as ye see him in, for in that he brake the oath of his order,</a>
<a id='line_9759'>for he hath been more than an hundred winter a man of a religion. And</a>
<a id='line_9760'>then the good man and Sir Launcelot went into the chapel; and the good</a>
<a id='line_9761'>man took a stole about his neck, and a book, and then he conjured on</a>
<a id='line_9762'>that book; and with that they saw in an hideous figure and horrible,</a>
<a id='line_9763'>that there was no man so hard-hearted nor so hard but he should have</a>
<a id='line_9764'>been afeard. Then said the fiend: Thou hast travailed me greatly; now</a>
<a id='line_9765'>tell me what thou wilt with me. I will, said the good man, that thou</a>
<a id='line_9766'>tell me how my fellow became dead, and whether he be saved or damned.</a>
<a id='line_9767'>Then he said with an horrible voice: He is not lost but saved. How may</a>
<a id='line_9768'>that be? said the good man; it seemed to me that he lived not well, for</a>
<a id='line_9769'>he brake his order for to wear a shirt where he ought to wear none, and</a>
<a id='line_9770'>who that trespasseth against our order doth not well. Not so, said the</a>
<a id='line_9771'>fiend, this man that lieth here dead was come of a great lineage. And</a>
<a id='line_9772'>there was a lord that hight the Earl de Vale, that held great war</a>
<a id='line_9773'>against this man’s nephew, the which hight Aguarus. And so this Aguarus</a>
<a id='line_9774'>saw the earl was bigger than he. Then he went for to take counsel of</a>
<a id='line_9775'>his uncle, the which lieth here dead as ye may see. And then he asked</a>
<a id='line_9776'>leave, and went out of his hermitage for to maintain his nephew against</a>
<a id='line_9777'>the mighty earl; and so it happed that this man that lieth here dead</a>
<a id='line_9778'>did so much by his wisdom and hardiness that the earl was taken, and</a>
<a id='line_9779'>three of his lords, by force of this dead man.</a>

<a id='line_9784'>CHAPTER II. Of a dead man, how men would have hewn him, and it would</a>
<a id='line_9785'>not be, and how Sir Launcelot took the hair of the dead man.</a>
<a id='line_9786'></a>
<a id='line_9787'></a>
<a id='line_9788'>Then was there peace betwixt the earl and this Aguarus, and great</a>
<a id='line_9789'>surety that the earl should never war against him. Then this dead man</a>
<a id='line_9790'>that here lieth came to this hermitage again; and then the earl made</a>
<a id='line_9791'>two of his nephews for to be avenged upon this man. So they came on a</a>
<a id='line_9792'>day, and found this dead man at the sacring of his mass, and they abode</a>
<a id='line_9793'>him till he had said mass. And then they set upon him and drew out</a>
<a id='line_9794'>swords to have slain him; but there would no sword bite on him more</a>
<a id='line_9795'>than upon a gad of steel, for the high Lord which he served He him</a>
<a id='line_9796'>preserved. Then made they a great fire, and did off all his clothes,</a>
<a id='line_9797'>and the hair off his back. And then this dead man hermit said unto</a>
<a id='line_9798'>them: Ween you to burn me? It shall not lie in your power nor to perish</a>
<a id='line_9799'>me as much as a thread, an there were any on my body. No? said one of</a>
<a id='line_9800'>them, it shall be assayed. And then they despoiled him, and put upon</a>
<a id='line_9801'>him this shirt, and cast him in a fire, and there he lay all that night</a>
<a id='line_9802'>till it was day in that fire, and was not dead, and so in the morn I</a>
<a id='line_9803'>came and found him dead; but I found neither thread nor skin tamed, and</a>
<a id='line_9804'>so took him out of the fire with great fear, and laid him here as ye</a>
<a id='line_9805'>may see. And now may ye suffer me to go my way, for I have said you the</a>
<a id='line_9806'>sooth. And then he departed with a great tempest.</a>
<a id='line_9807'></a>
<a id='line_9808'>Then was the good man and Sir Launcelot more gladder than they were</a>
<a id='line_9809'>to-fore. And then Sir Launcelot dwelled with that good man that night.</a>
<a id='line_9810'>Sir, said the good man, be ye not Sir Launcelot du Lake? Yea, sir, said</a>
<a id='line_9811'>he. What seek ye in this country? Sir, said Sir Launcelot, I go to seek</a>
<a id='line_9812'>the adventures of the Sangreal. Well, said he, seek it ye may well, but</a>
<a id='line_9813'>though it were here ye shall have no power to see it no more than a</a>
<a id='line_9814'>blind man should see a bright sword, and that is long on your sin, and</a>
<a id='line_9815'>else ye were more abler than any man living. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_9816'>began to weep. Then said the good man: Were ye confessed sith ye</a>
<a id='line_9817'>entered into the quest of the Sangreal? Yea, sir, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_9818'>Then upon the morn when the good man had sung his mass, then they</a>
<a id='line_9819'>buried the dead man. Then Sir Launcelot said: Father, what shall I do?</a>
<a id='line_9820'>Now, said the good man, I require you take this hair that was this holy</a>
<a id='line_9821'>man’s and put it next thy skin, and it shall prevail thee greatly. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_9822'>and I will do it, said Sir Launcelot. Also I charge you that ye eat no</a>
<a id='line_9823'>flesh as long as ye be in the quest of the Sangreal, nor ye shall drink</a>
<a id='line_9824'>no wine, and that ye hear mass daily an ye may do it. So he took the</a>
<a id='line_9825'>hair and put it upon him, and so departed at evensong-time.</a>
<a id='line_9826'></a>
<a id='line_9827'>And so rode he into a forest, and there he met with a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_9828'>riding upon a white palfrey, and then she asked him: Sir knight,</a>
<a id='line_9829'>whither ride ye? Certes, damosel, said Launcelot, I wot not whither I</a>
<a id='line_9830'>ride but as fortune leadeth me. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said she, I wot what</a>
<a id='line_9831'>adventure ye seek, for ye were afore time nearer than ye be now, and</a>
<a id='line_9832'>yet shall ye see it more openly than ever ye did, and that shall ye</a>
<a id='line_9833'>understand in short time. Then Sir Launcelot asked her where he might</a>
<a id='line_9834'>be harboured that night. Ye shall not find this day nor night, but</a>
<a id='line_9835'>to-morn ye shall find harbour good, and ease of that ye be in doubt of.</a>
<a id='line_9836'>And then he commended her unto God. Then he rode till that he came to a</a>
<a id='line_9837'>Cross, and took that for his host as for that night.</a>
<a id='line_9838'></a>
<a id='line_9839'></a>
<a id='line_9840'></a>
<a id='line_9841'></a>
<a id='line_9842'>CHAPTER III. Of an advision that Sir Launcelot had, and how he told it</a>
<a id='line_9843'>to an hermit, and desired counsel of him.</a>
<a id='line_9844'></a>
<a id='line_9845'></a>
<a id='line_9846'>And so he put his horse to pasture, and did off his helm and his</a>
<a id='line_9847'>shield, and made his prayers unto the Cross that he never fall in</a>
<a id='line_9848'>deadly sin again. And so he laid him down to sleep. And anon as he was</a>
<a id='line_9849'>asleep it befell him there an advision, that there came a man afore him</a>
<a id='line_9850'>all by compass of stars, and that man had a crown of gold on his head</a>
<a id='line_9851'>and that man led in his fellowship seven kings and two knights. And all</a>
<a id='line_9852'>these worshipped the Cross, kneeling upon their knees, holding up their</a>
<a id='line_9853'>hands toward the heaven. And all they said: Fair sweet Father of heaven</a>
<a id='line_9854'>come and visit us, and yield unto us everych as we have deserved.</a>
<a id='line_9855'></a>
<a id='line_9856'>Then looked Launcelot up to the heaven, and him seemed the clouds did</a>
<a id='line_9857'>open, and an old man came down, with a company of angels, and alighted</a>
<a id='line_9858'>among them, and gave unto everych his blessing, and called them his</a>
<a id='line_9859'>servants, and good and true knights. And when this old man had said</a>
<a id='line_9860'>thus he came to one of those knights, and said: I have lost all that I</a>
<a id='line_9861'>have set in thee, for thou hast ruled thee against me as a warrior, and</a>
<a id='line_9862'>used wrong wars with vain-glory, more for the pleasure of the world</a>
<a id='line_9863'>than to please me, therefore thou shalt be confounded without thou</a>
<a id='line_9864'>yield me my treasure. All this advision saw Sir Launcelot at the Cross.</a>
<a id='line_9865'></a>
<a id='line_9866'>And on the morn he took his horse and rode till mid-day; and there by</a>
<a id='line_9867'>adventure he met with the same knight that took his horse, helm, and</a>
<a id='line_9868'>his sword, when he slept when the Sangreal appeared afore the Cross.</a>
<a id='line_9869'>When Sir Launcelot saw him he saluted hin not fair, but cried on high:</a>
<a id='line_9870'>Knight, keep thee, for thou hast done to me great unkindness. And then</a>
<a id='line_9871'>they put afore them their spears, and Sir Launcelot came so fiercely</a>
<a id='line_9872'>upon him that he smote him and his horse down to the earth, that he had</a>
<a id='line_9873'>nigh broken his neck. Then Sir Launcelot took the knight’s horse that</a>
<a id='line_9874'>was his own aforehand, and descended from the horse he sat upon, and</a>
<a id='line_9875'>mounted upon his own horse, and tied the knight’s own horse to a tree,</a>
<a id='line_9876'>that he might find that horse when that he was arisen. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_9877'>Launcelot rode till night, and by adventure he met an hermit, and each</a>
<a id='line_9878'>of them saluted other; and there he rested with that good man all</a>
<a id='line_9879'>night, and gave his horse such as he might get. Then said the good man</a>
<a id='line_9880'>unto Launcelot: Of whence be ye? Sir, said he, I am of Arthur’s court,</a>
<a id='line_9881'>and my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake that am in the quest of the</a>
<a id='line_9882'>Sangreal, and therefore I pray you to counsel me of a vision the which</a>
<a id='line_9883'>I had at the Cross. And so he told him all.</a>
<a id='line_9884'></a>
<a id='line_9885'></a>
<a id='line_9886'></a>
<a id='line_9887'></a>
<a id='line_9888'>CHAPTER IV. How the hermit expounded to Sir Launcelot his advision, and</a>
<a id='line_9889'>told him that Sir Galahad was his son.</a>
<a id='line_9890'></a>
<a id='line_9891'></a>
<a id='line_9892'>Lo, Sir Launcelot, said the good man, there thou mightest understand</a>
<a id='line_9893'>the high lineage that thou art come of, and thine advision betokeneth.</a>
<a id='line_9894'>After the passion of Jesu Christ forty year, Joseph of Aramathie</a>
<a id='line_9895'>preached the victory of King Evelake, that he had in the battles the</a>
<a id='line_9896'>better of his enemies. And of the seven kings and the two knights: the</a>
<a id='line_9897'>first of them is called Nappus, an holy man; and the second hight</a>
<a id='line_9898'>Nacien, in remembrance of his grandsire, and in him dwelled our Lord</a>
<a id='line_9899'>Jesu Christ; and the third was called Helias le Grose; and the fourth</a>
<a id='line_9900'>hight Lisais; and the fifth hight Jonas, he departed out of his country</a>
<a id='line_9901'>and went into Wales, and took there the daughter of Manuel, whereby he</a>
<a id='line_9902'>had the land of Gaul, and he came to dwell in this country. And of him</a>
<a id='line_9903'>came King Launcelot thy grandsire, the which there wedded the king’s</a>
<a id='line_9904'>daughter of Ireland, and he was as worthy a man as thou art, and of him</a>
<a id='line_9905'>came King Ban, thy father, the which was the last of the seven kings.</a>
<a id='line_9906'>And by thee, Sir Launcelot, it signifieth that the angels said thou</a>
<a id='line_9907'>were none of the seven fellowships. And the last was the ninth knight,</a>
<a id='line_9908'>he was signified to a lion, for he should pass all manner of earthly</a>
<a id='line_9909'>knights, that is Sir Galahad, the which thou gat on King Pelles’</a>
<a id='line_9910'>daughter; and thou ought to thank God more than any other man living,</a>
<a id='line_9911'>for of a sinner earthly thou hast no peer as in knighthood, nor never</a>
<a id='line_9912'>shall be. But little thank hast thou given to God for all the great</a>
<a id='line_9913'>virtues that God hath lent thee. Sir, said Launcelot, ye say that that</a>
<a id='line_9914'>good knight is my son. That oughtest thou to know and no man better,</a>
<a id='line_9915'>said the good man, for thou knewest the daughter of King Pelles</a>
<a id='line_9916'>fleshly, and on her thou begattest Galahad, and that was he that at the</a>
<a id='line_9917'>feast of Pentecost sat in the Siege Perilous; and therefore make thou</a>
<a id='line_9918'>it known openly that he is one of thy begetting on King Pelles’</a>
<a id='line_9919'>daughter, for that will be your worship and honour, and to all thy</a>
<a id='line_9920'>kindred. And I counsel you in no place press not upon him to have ado</a>
<a id='line_9921'>with him. Well, said Launcelot, meseemeth that good knight should pray</a>
<a id='line_9922'>for me unto the High Father, that I fall not to sin again. Trust thou</a>
<a id='line_9923'>well, said the good man, thou farest mickle the better for his prayer;</a>
<a id='line_9924'>but the son shall not bear the wickedness of the father, nor the father</a>
<a id='line_9925'>shall not bear the wickedness of the son, but everych shall bear his</a>
<a id='line_9926'>own burden. And therefore beseek thou only God, and He will help thee</a>
<a id='line_9927'>in all thy needs. And then Sir Launcelot and he went to supper, and so</a>
<a id='line_9928'>laid him to rest, and the hair pricked so Sir Launcelot’s skin which</a>
<a id='line_9929'>grieved him full sore, but he took it meekly, and suffered the pain.</a>
<a id='line_9930'>And so on the morn he heard his mass and took his arms, and so took his</a>
<a id='line_9931'>leave.</a>
<a id='line_9932'></a>
<a id='line_9933'></a>
<a id='line_9934'></a>
<a id='line_9935'></a>
<a id='line_9936'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot jousted with many knights, and how he was</a>
<a id='line_9937'>taken.</a>
<a id='line_9938'></a>
<a id='line_9939'></a>
<a id='line_9940'>And then mounted upon his horse, and rode into a forest, and held no</a>
<a id='line_9941'>highway. And as he looked afore him he saw a fair plain, and beside</a>
<a id='line_9942'>that a fair castle, and afore the castle were many pavilions of silk</a>
<a id='line_9943'>and of diverse hue. And him seemed that he saw there five hundred</a>
<a id='line_9944'>knights riding on horseback; and there were two parties: they that were</a>
<a id='line_9945'>of the castle were all on black horses and their trappings black, and</a>
<a id='line_9946'>they that were without were all on white horses and trappings, and</a>
<a id='line_9947'>everych hurtled to other that it marvelled Sir Launcelot. And at the</a>
<a id='line_9948'>last him thought they of the castle were put to the worse.</a>
<a id='line_9949'></a>
<a id='line_9950'>Then thought Sir Launcelot for to help there the weaker party in</a>
<a id='line_9951'>increasing of his chivalry. And so Sir Launcelot thrust in among the</a>
<a id='line_9952'>party of the castle, and smote down a knight, horse and man, to the</a>
<a id='line_9953'>earth. And then he rashed here and there, and did marvellous deeds of</a>
<a id='line_9954'>arms. And then he drew out his sword, and struck many knights to the</a>
<a id='line_9955'>earth, so that all those that saw him marvelled that ever one knight</a>
<a id='line_9956'>might do so great deeds of arms.</a>
<a id='line_9957'></a>
<a id='line_9958'>But always the white knights held them nigh about Sir Launcelot, for to</a>
<a id='line_9959'>tire him and wind him. But at the last, as a man may not ever endure,</a>
<a id='line_9960'>Sir Launcelot waxed so faint of fighting and travailing, and was so</a>
<a id='line_9961'>weary of his great deeds, but he might not lift up his arms for to give</a>
<a id='line_9962'>one stroke, so that he weened never to have borne arms; and then they</a>
<a id='line_9963'>all took and led him away into a forest, and there made him to alight</a>
<a id='line_9964'>and to rest him.</a>
<a id='line_9965'></a>
<a id='line_9966'>And then all the fellowship of the castle were overcome for the default</a>
<a id='line_9967'>of him.</a>
<a id='line_9968'></a>
<a id='line_9969'>Then they said all unto Sir Launcelot: Blessed be God that ye be now of</a>
<a id='line_9970'>our fellowship, for we shall hold you in our prison; and so they left</a>
<a id='line_9971'>him with few words.</a>
<a id='line_9972'></a>
<a id='line_9973'>And then Sir Launcelot made great sorrow, For never or now was I never</a>
<a id='line_9974'>at tournament nor jousts but I had the best, and now I am shamed; and</a>
<a id='line_9975'>then he said: Now I am sure that I am more sinfuller than ever I was.</a>
<a id='line_9976'></a>
<a id='line_9977'>Thus he rode sorrowing, and half a day he was out of despair, till that</a>
<a id='line_9978'>he came into a deep valley. And when Sir Launcelot saw he might not</a>
<a id='line_9979'>ride up into the mountain, he there alighted under an apple tree, and</a>
<a id='line_9980'>there he left his helm and his shield, and put his horse unto pasture.</a>
<a id='line_9981'>And then he laid him down to sleep. And then him thought there came an</a>
<a id='line_9982'>old man afore him, the which said: Ah, Launcelot of evil faith and poor</a>
<a id='line_9983'>belief, wherefore is thy will turned so lightly toward thy deadly sin?</a>
<a id='line_9984'>And when he had said thus he vanished away, and Launcelot wist not</a>
<a id='line_9985'>where he was become. Then he took his horse, and armed him; and as he</a>
<a id='line_9986'>rode by the way he saw a chapel where was a recluse, which had a window</a>
<a id='line_9987'>that she might see up to the altar. And all aloud she called Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_9988'>for that he seemed a knight errant. And then he came, and she asked him</a>
<a id='line_9989'>what he was, and of what place, and where about he went to seek.</a>
<a id='line_9990'></a>

<a id='line_9994'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot told his advision to a woman, and how she</a>
<a id='line_9995'>expounded it to him.</a>
<a id='line_9996'></a>
<a id='line_9997'></a>
<a id='line_9998'>And then he told her altogether word by word, and the truth how it</a>
<a id='line_9999'>befell him at the tournament. And after told her his advision that he</a>
<a id='line_10000'>had had that night in his sleep, and prayed her to tell him what it</a>
<a id='line_10001'>might mean, for he was not well content with it. Ah, Launcelot, said</a>
<a id='line_10002'>she, as long as ye were knight of earthly knighthood ye were the most</a>
<a id='line_10003'>marvellous man of the world, and most adventurous. Now, said the lady,</a>
<a id='line_10004'>sithen ye be set among the knights of heavenly adventures, if adventure</a>
<a id='line_10005'>fell thee contrary at that tournament have thou no marvel, for that</a>
<a id='line_10006'>tournament yesterday was but a tokening of Our Lord. And not for then</a>
<a id='line_10007'>there was none enchantment, for they at the tournament were earthly</a>
<a id='line_10008'>knights. The tournament was a token to see who should have most</a>
<a id='line_10009'>knights, either Eliazar, the son of King Pelles, or Argustus, the son</a>
<a id='line_10010'>of King Harlon. But Eliazar was all clothed in white, and Argustus was</a>
<a id='line_10011'>covered in black, the which were [over]come.</a>
<a id='line_10012'></a>
<a id='line_10013'>All what this betokeneth I shall tell you. The day of Pentecost, when</a>
<a id='line_10014'>King Arthur held his court, it befell that earthly kings and knights</a>
<a id='line_10015'>took a tournament together, that is to say the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_10016'>The earthly knights were they the which were clothed all in black, and</a>
<a id='line_10017'>the covering betokeneth the sins whereof they be not confessed. And</a>
<a id='line_10018'>they with the covering of white betokeneth virginity, and they that</a>
<a id='line_10019'>chose chastity. And thus was the quest begun in them. Then thou beheld</a>
<a id='line_10020'>the sinners and the good men, and when thou sawest the sinners</a>
<a id='line_10021'>overcome, thou inclinest to that party for bobaunce and pride of the</a>
<a id='line_10022'>world, and all that must be left in that quest, for in this quest thou</a>
<a id='line_10023'>shalt have many fellows and thy betters. For thou art so feeble of evil</a>
<a id='line_10024'>trust and good belief, this made it when thou were there where they</a>
<a id='line_10025'>took thee and led thee into the forest. And anon there appeared the</a>
<a id='line_10026'>Sangreal unto the white knights, but thou was so feeble of good belief</a>
<a id='line_10027'>and faith that thou mightest not abide it for all the teaching of the</a>
<a id='line_10028'>good man, but anon thou turnest to the sinners, and that caused thy</a>
<a id='line_10029'>misadventure that thou should’st know good from evil and vain glory of</a>
<a id='line_10030'>the world, the which is not worth a pear. And for great pride thou</a>
<a id='line_10031'>madest great sorrow that thou hadst not overcome all the white knights</a>
<a id='line_10032'>with the covering of white, by whom was betokened virginity and</a>
<a id='line_10033'>chastity; and therefore God was wroth with you, for God loveth no such</a>
<a id='line_10034'>deeds in this quest. And this advision signifieth that thou were of</a>
<a id='line_10035'>evil faith and of poor belief, the which will make thee to fall into</a>
<a id='line_10036'>the deep pit of hell if thou keep thee not. Now have I warned thee of</a>
<a id='line_10037'>thy vain glory and of thy pride, that thou hast many times erred</a>
<a id='line_10038'>against thy Maker. Beware of everlasting pain, for of all earthly</a>
<a id='line_10039'>knights I have most pity of thee, for I know well thou hast not thy</a>
<a id='line_10040'>peer of any earthly sinful man.</a>
<a id='line_10041'></a>
<a id='line_10042'>And so she commended Sir Launcelot to dinner. And after dinner he took</a>
<a id='line_10043'>his horse and commended her to God, and so rode into a deep valley, and</a>
<a id='line_10044'>there he saw a river and an high mountain. And through the water he</a>
<a id='line_10045'>must needs pass, the which was hideous; and then in the name of God he</a>
<a id='line_10046'>took it with good heart. And when he came over he saw an armed knight,</a>
<a id='line_10047'>horse and man black as any bear; without any word he smote Sir</a>
<a id='line_10048'>Launcelot’s horse to the earth; and so he passed on, he wist not where</a>
<a id='line_10049'>he was become. And then he took his helm and his shield, and thanked</a>
<a id='line_10050'>God of his adventure.</a>

<a id='line_10063'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Gawaine was nigh weary of the quest of the Sangreal,</a>
<a id='line_10064'>and of his marvellous dream.</a>
<a id='line_10065'></a>
<a id='line_10066'></a>
<a id='line_10067'>When Sir Gawaine was departed from his fellowship he rode long without</a>
<a id='line_10068'>any adventure. For he found not the tenth part of adventure as he was</a>
<a id='line_10069'>wont to do. For Sir Gawaine rode from Whitsuntide until Michaelmas and</a>
<a id='line_10070'>found none adventure that pleased him. So on a day it befell Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_10071'>met with Sir Ector de Maris, and either made great joy of other that it</a>
<a id='line_10072'>were marvel to tell. And so they told everych other, and complained</a>
<a id='line_10073'>them greatly that they could find none adventure. Truly, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10074'>Gawaine unto Sir Ector, I am nigh weary of this quest, and loath I am</a>
<a id='line_10075'>to follow further in strange countries. One thing marvelled me, said</a>
<a id='line_10076'>Sir Ector, I have met with twenty knights, fellows of mine, and all</a>
<a id='line_10077'>they complain as I do. I have marvel, said Sir Gawaine, where that Sir</a>
<a id='line_10078'>Launcelot, your brother, is. Truly, said Sir Ector, I cannot hear of</a>
<a id='line_10079'>him, nor of Sir Galahad, Percivale, nor Sir Bors. Let them be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10080'>Gawaine, for they four have no peers. And if one thing were not in Sir</a>
<a id='line_10081'>Launcelot he had no fellow of none earthly man; but he is as we be, but</a>
<a id='line_10082'>if he took more pain upon him. But an these four be met together they</a>
<a id='line_10083'>will be loath that any man meet with them; for an they fail of the</a>
<a id='line_10084'>Sangreal it is in waste of all the remnant to recover it.</a>
<a id='line_10085'></a>
<a id='line_10086'>Thus Ector and Gawaine rode more than eight days, and on a Saturday</a>
<a id='line_10087'>they found an old chapel, the which was wasted that there seemed no man</a>
<a id='line_10088'>thither repaired; and there they alighted, and set their spears at the</a>
<a id='line_10089'>door, and in they entered into the chapel, and there made their orisons</a>
<a id='line_10090'>a great while, and set them down in the sieges of the chapel. And as</a>
<a id='line_10091'>they spake of one thing and other, for heaviness they fell asleep, and</a>
<a id='line_10092'>there befell them both marvellous adventures. Sir Gawaine him seemed he</a>
<a id='line_10093'>came into a meadow full of herbs and flowers, and there he saw a rack</a>
<a id='line_10094'>of bulls, an hundred and fifty, that were proud and black, save three</a>
<a id='line_10095'>of them were all white, and one had a black spot, and the other two</a>
<a id='line_10096'>were so fair and so white that they might be no whiter. And these three</a>
<a id='line_10097'>bulls which were so fair were tied with two strong cords. And the</a>
<a id='line_10098'>remnant of the bulls said among them: Go we hence to seek better</a>
<a id='line_10099'>pasture. And so some went, and some came again, but they were so lean</a>
<a id='line_10100'>that they might not stand upright; and of the bulls that were so white,</a>
<a id='line_10101'>that one came again and no mo. But when this white bull was come again</a>
<a id='line_10102'>among these other there rose up a great cry for lack of wind that</a>
<a id='line_10103'>failed them; and so they departed one here and another there: this</a>
<a id='line_10104'>advision befell Gawaine that night.</a>

<a id='line_10108'></a>
<a id='line_10109'>CHAPTER II. Of the advision of Sir Ector, and how he jousted with Sir</a>
<a id='line_10110'>Uwaine les Avoutres, his sworn brother.</a>
<a id='line_10111'></a>
<a id='line_10112'></a>
<a id='line_10113'>But to Ector de Maris befell another vision the contrary. For it seemed</a>
<a id='line_10114'>him that his brother, Sir Launcelot, and he alighted out of a chair and</a>
<a id='line_10115'>leapt upon two horses, and the one said to the other: Go we seek that</a>
<a id='line_10116'>we shall not find. And him thought that a man beat Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_10117'>despoiled him, and clothed him in another array, the which was all full</a>
<a id='line_10118'>of knots, and set him upon an ass, and so he rode till he came to the</a>
<a id='line_10119'>fairest well that ever he saw; and Sir Launcelot alighted and would</a>
<a id='line_10120'>have drunk of that well. And when he stooped to drink of the water the</a>
<a id='line_10121'>water sank from him. And when Sir Launcelot saw that, he turned and</a>
<a id='line_10122'>went thither as the head came from. And in the meanwhile he trowed that</a>
<a id='line_10123'>himself and Sir Ector rode till that they came to a rich man’s house</a>
<a id='line_10124'>where there was a wedding. And there he saw a king the which said: Sir</a>
<a id='line_10125'>knight, here is no place for you. And then he turned again unto the</a>
<a id='line_10126'>chair that he came from.</a>
<a id='line_10127'></a>
<a id='line_10128'>Thus within a while both Gawaine and Ector awaked, and either told</a>
<a id='line_10129'>other of their advision, the which marvelled them greatly. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_10130'>Ector, I shall never be merry till I hear tidings of my brother</a>
<a id='line_10131'>Launcelot. Now as they sat thus talking they saw an hand showing unto</a>
<a id='line_10132'>the elbow, and was covered with red samite, and upon that hung a bridle</a>
<a id='line_10133'>not right rich, and held within the fist a great candle which burned</a>
<a id='line_10134'>right clear, and so passed afore them, and entered into the chapel, and</a>
<a id='line_10135'>then vanished away and they wist not where. And anon came down a voice</a>
<a id='line_10136'>which said: Knights of full evil faith and of poor belief, these two</a>
<a id='line_10137'>things have failed you, and therefore ye may not come to the adventures</a>
<a id='line_10138'>of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_10139'></a>
<a id='line_10140'>Then first spake Gawaine and said: Ector, have ye heard these words?</a>
<a id='line_10141'>Yea truly, said Sir Ector, I heard all. Now go we, said Sir Ector, unto</a>
<a id='line_10142'>some hermit that will tell us of our advision, for it seemeth me we</a>
<a id='line_10143'>labour all in vain. And so they departed and rode into a valley, and</a>
<a id='line_10144'>there met with a squire which rode on an hackney, and they saluted him</a>
<a id='line_10145'>fair. Sir, said Gawaine, can thou teach us to any hermit? Here is one</a>
<a id='line_10146'>in a little mountain, but it is so rough there may no horse go thither,</a>
<a id='line_10147'>and therefore ye must go upon foot; there shall ye find a poor house,</a>
<a id='line_10148'>and there is Nacien the hermit, which is the holiest man in this</a>
<a id='line_10149'>country. And so they departed either from other.</a>
<a id='line_10150'></a>
<a id='line_10151'>And then in a valley they met with a knight all armed, which proffered</a>
<a id='line_10152'>them to joust as far as he saw them. In the name of God, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10153'>Gawaine, sith I departed from Camelot there was none proffered me to</a>
<a id='line_10154'>joust but once. And now, sir, said Ector, let me joust with him. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_10155'>said Gawaine, ye shall not but if I be beat; it shall not for-think me</a>
<a id='line_10156'>then if ye go after me. And then either embraced other to joust and</a>
<a id='line_10157'>came together as fast as their horses might run, and brast their</a>
<a id='line_10158'>shields and the mails, and the one more than the other; and Gawaine was</a>
<a id='line_10159'>wounded in the left side, but the other knight was smitten through the</a>
<a id='line_10160'>breast, and the spear came out on the other side, and so they fell both</a>
<a id='line_10161'>out of their saddles, and in the falling they brake both their spears.</a>
<a id='line_10162'></a>
<a id='line_10163'>Anon Gawaine arose and set his hand to his sword, and cast his shield</a>
<a id='line_10164'>afore him. But all for naught was it, for the knight had no power to</a>
<a id='line_10165'>arise against him. Then said Gawaine: Ye must yield you as an overcome</a>
<a id='line_10166'>man, or else I may slay you. Ah, sir knight, said he, I am but dead,</a>
<a id='line_10167'>for God’s sake and of your gentleness lead me here unto an abbey that I</a>
<a id='line_10168'>may receive my Creator. Sir, said Gawaine, I know no house of religion</a>
<a id='line_10169'>hereby. Sir, said the knight, set me on an horse to-fore you, and I</a>
<a id='line_10170'>shall teach you. Gawaine set him up in the saddle, and he leapt up</a>
<a id='line_10171'>behind him for to sustain him, and so came to an abbey where they were</a>
<a id='line_10172'>well received; and anon he was unarmed, and received his Creator. Then</a>
<a id='line_10173'>he prayed Gawaine to draw out the truncheon of the spear out of his</a>
<a id='line_10174'>body. Then Gawaine asked him what he was, that knew him not. I am, said</a>
<a id='line_10175'>he, of King Arthur’s court, and was a fellow of the Round Table, and we</a>
<a id='line_10176'>were brethren sworn together; and now Sir Gawaine, thou hast slain me,</a>
<a id='line_10177'>and my name is Uwaine les Avoutres, that sometime was son unto King</a>
<a id='line_10178'>Uriens, and was in the quest of the Sangreal; and now forgive it thee</a>
<a id='line_10179'>God, for it shall ever be said that the one sworn brother hath slain</a>
<a id='line_10180'>the other.</a>
<a id='line_10181'></a>

<a id='line_10185'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector came to an hermitage to be</a>
<a id='line_10186'>confessed, and how they told to the hermit their advisions.</a>
<a id='line_10187'></a>
<a id='line_10188'></a>
<a id='line_10189'>Alas, said Gawaine, that ever this misadventure is befallen me. No</a>
<a id='line_10190'>force, said Uwaine, sith I shall die this death, of a much more</a>
<a id='line_10191'>worshipfuller man’s hand might I not die; but when ye come to the court</a>
<a id='line_10192'>recommend me unto my lord, King Arthur, and all those that be left</a>
<a id='line_10193'>alive, and for old brotherhood think on me. Then began Gawaine to weep,</a>
<a id='line_10194'>and Ector also. And then Uwaine himself and Sir Gawaine drew out the</a>
<a id='line_10195'>truncheon of the spear, and anon departed the soul from the body. Then</a>
<a id='line_10196'>Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector buried him as men ought to bury a king’s son,</a>
<a id='line_10197'>and made write upon his name, and by whom he was slain.</a>
<a id='line_10198'></a>
<a id='line_10199'>Then departed Gawaine and Ector, as heavy as they might for their</a>
<a id='line_10200'>misadventure, and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain,</a>
<a id='line_10201'>and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And</a>
<a id='line_10202'>when they were come up they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a</a>
<a id='line_10203'>little courtelage, where Nacien the hermit gathered worts, as he which</a>
<a id='line_10204'>had tasted none other meat of a great while. And when he saw the errant</a>
<a id='line_10205'>knights he came toward them and saluted them, and they him again. Fair</a>
<a id='line_10206'>lords, said he, what adventure brought you hither? Sir, said Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_10207'>to speak with you for to be confessed. Sir, said the hermit, I am</a>
<a id='line_10208'>ready. Then they told him so much that he wist well what they were. And</a>
<a id='line_10209'>then he thought to counsel them if he might.</a>
<a id='line_10210'></a>
<a id='line_10211'>Then began Gawaine first and told him of his advision that he had had</a>
<a id='line_10212'>in the chapel, and Ector told him all as it is afore rehearsed. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_10213'>said the hermit unto Sir Gawaine, the fair meadow and the rack therein</a>
<a id='line_10214'>ought to be understood the Round Table, and by the meadow ought to be</a>
<a id='line_10215'>understood humility and patience, those be the things which be always</a>
<a id='line_10216'>green and quick; for men may no time overcome humility and patience,</a>
<a id='line_10217'>therefore was the Round Table founded, and the chivalry hath been at</a>
<a id='line_10218'>all times so by the fraternity which was there that she might not be</a>
<a id='line_10219'>overcome; for men said she was founded in patience and in humility. At</a>
<a id='line_10220'>the rack ate an hundred and fifty bulls; but they ate not in the</a>
<a id='line_10221'>meadow, for their hearts should be set in humility and patience, and</a>
<a id='line_10222'>the bulls were proud and black save only three. By the bulls is to</a>
<a id='line_10223'>understand the fellowship of the Round Table, which for their sin and</a>
<a id='line_10224'>their wickedness be black. Blackness is to say without good or virtuous</a>
<a id='line_10225'>works. And the three bulls which were white save only one that was</a>
<a id='line_10226'>spotted: the two white betoken Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale, for they</a>
<a id='line_10227'>be maidens clean and without spot; and the third that had a spot</a>
<a id='line_10228'>signifieth Sir Bors de Ganis, which trespassed but once in his</a>
<a id='line_10229'>virginity, but sithen he kept himself so well in chastity that all is</a>
<a id='line_10230'>forgiven him and his misdeeds. And why those three were tied by the</a>
<a id='line_10231'>necks, they be three knights in virginity and chastity, and there is no</a>
<a id='line_10232'>pride smitten in them. And the black bulls which said: Go we hence,</a>
<a id='line_10233'>they were those which at Pentecost at the high feast took upon them to</a>
<a id='line_10234'>go in the quest of the Sangreal without confession: they might not</a>
<a id='line_10235'>enter in the meadow of humility and patience. And therefore they</a>
<a id='line_10236'>returned into waste countries, that signifieth death, for there shall</a>
<a id='line_10237'>die many of them: everych of them shall slay other for sin, and they</a>
<a id='line_10238'>that shall escape shall be so lean that it shall be marvel to see them.</a>
<a id='line_10239'>And of the three bulls without spot, the one shall come again, and the</a>
<a id='line_10240'>other two never.</a>

<a id='line_10246'></a>
<a id='line_10247'></a>
<a id='line_10248'>Then spake Nacien unto Ector: Sooth it is that Launcelot and ye came</a>
<a id='line_10249'>down off one chair: the chair betokeneth mastership and lordship which</a>
<a id='line_10250'>ye came down from. But ye two knights, said the hermit, ye go to seek</a>
<a id='line_10251'>that ye shall never find, that is the Sangreal; for it is the secret</a>
<a id='line_10252'>thing of our Lord Jesu Christ. What is to mean that Sir Launcelot fell</a>
<a id='line_10253'>down off his horse: he hath left pride and taken him to humility, for</a>
<a id='line_10254'>he hath cried mercy loud for his sin, and sore repented him, and our</a>
<a id='line_10255'>Lord hath clothed him in his clothing which is full of knots, that is</a>
<a id='line_10256'>the hair that he weareth daily. And the ass that he rode upon is a</a>
<a id='line_10257'>beast of humility, for God would not ride upon no steed, nor upon no</a>
<a id='line_10258'>palfrey; so in ensample that an ass betokeneth meekness, that thou</a>
<a id='line_10259'>sawest Sir Launcelot ride on in thy sleep. And the well whereas the</a>
<a id='line_10260'>water sank from him when he should have taken thereof, and when he saw</a>
<a id='line_10261'>he might not have it, he returned thither from whence he came, for the</a>
<a id='line_10262'>well betokeneth the high grace of God, the more men desire it to take</a>
<a id='line_10263'>it, the more shall be their desire. So when he came nigh the Sangreal,</a>
<a id='line_10264'>he meeked him that he held him not a man worthy to be so nigh the Holy</a>
<a id='line_10265'>Vessel, for he had been so defouled in deadly sin by the space of many</a>
<a id='line_10266'>years; yet when he kneeled to drink of the well, there he saw great</a>
<a id='line_10267'>providence of the Sangreal. And for he had served so long the devil, he</a>
<a id='line_10268'>shall have vengeance four-and-twenty days long, for that he hath been</a>
<a id='line_10269'>the devil’s servant four-and-twenty years. And then soon after he shall</a>
<a id='line_10270'>return unto Camelot out of this country, and he shall say a part of</a>
<a id='line_10271'>such things as he hath found.</a>
<a id='line_10272'></a>
<a id='line_10273'>Now will I tell you what betokeneth the hand with the candle and the</a>
<a id='line_10274'>bridle: that is to understand the Holy Ghost where charity is ever, and</a>
<a id='line_10275'>the bridle signifieth abstinence. For when she is bridled in Christian</a>
<a id='line_10276'>man’s heart she holdeth him so short that he falleth not in deadly sin.</a>
<a id='line_10277'>And the candle which sheweth clearness and sight signifieth the right</a>
<a id='line_10278'>way of Jesu Christ. And when he went and said: Knights of poor faith</a>
<a id='line_10279'>and of wicked belief, these three things failed, charity, abstinence,</a>
<a id='line_10280'>and truth; therefore ye may not attain that high adventure of the</a>
<a id='line_10281'>Sangreal.</a>

<a id='line_10287'></a>
<a id='line_10288'></a>
<a id='line_10289'>Certes, said Gawaine, soothly have ye said, that I see it openly. Now,</a>
<a id='line_10290'>I pray you, good man and holy father, tell me why we met not with so</a>
<a id='line_10291'>many adventures as we were wont to do, and commonly have the better. I</a>
<a id='line_10292'>shall tell you gladly, said the good man; the adventure of the Sangreal</a>
<a id='line_10293'>which ye and many other have undertaken the quest of it and find it</a>
<a id='line_10294'>not, the cause is for it appeareth not to sinners. Wherefore marvel not</a>
<a id='line_10295'>though ye fail thereof, and many other. For ye be an untrue knight and</a>
<a id='line_10296'>a great murderer, and to good men signifieth other things than murder.</a>
<a id='line_10297'>For I dare say, as sinful as Sir Launcelot hath been, sith that he went</a>
<a id='line_10298'>into the quest of the Sangreal he slew never man, nor nought shall,</a>
<a id='line_10299'>till that he come unto Camelot again, for he hath taken upon him for to</a>
<a id='line_10300'>forsake sin. And nere that he nis not stable, but by his thought he is</a>
<a id='line_10301'>likely to turn again, he should be next to enchieve it save Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_10302'>his son. But God knoweth his thought and his unstableness, and yet</a>
<a id='line_10303'>shall he die right an holy man, and no doubt he hath no fellow of no</a>
<a id='line_10304'>earthly sinful man. Sir, said Gawaine, it seemeth me by your words that</a>
<a id='line_10305'>for our sins it will not avail us to travel in this quest. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_10306'>the good man, there be an hundred such as ye be that never shall</a>
<a id='line_10307'>prevail, but to have shame. And when they had heard these voices they</a>
<a id='line_10308'>commended him unto God.</a>
<a id='line_10309'></a>
<a id='line_10310'>Then the good man called Gawaine, and said: It is long time passed sith</a>
<a id='line_10311'>that ye were made knight, and never sithen thou servedst thy Maker, and</a>
<a id='line_10312'>now thou art so old a tree that in thee is neither life nor fruit;</a>
<a id='line_10313'>wherefore bethink thee that thou yield to Our Lord the bare rind, sith</a>
<a id='line_10314'>the fiend hath the leaves and the fruit. Sir, said Gawaine an I had</a>
<a id='line_10315'>leisure I would speak with you, but my fellow here, Sir Ector, is gone,</a>
<a id='line_10316'>and abideth me yonder beneath the hill. Well, said the good man, thou</a>
<a id='line_10317'>were better to be counselled. Then departed Gawaine and came to Ector,</a>
<a id='line_10318'>and so took their horses and rode till they came to a forester’s house,</a>
<a id='line_10319'>which harboured them right well. And on the morn they departed from</a>
<a id='line_10320'>their host, and rode long or they could find any adventure.</a>
<a id='line_10321'></a>

<a id='line_10325'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Bors met with an hermit, and how he was confessed</a>
<a id='line_10326'>to him, and of his penance enjoined to him.</a>
<a id='line_10327'></a>
<a id='line_10328'></a>
<a id='line_10329'>When Bors was departed from Camelot he met with a religious man riding</a>
<a id='line_10330'>on an ass, and Sir Bors saluted him. Anon the good man knew him that he</a>
<a id='line_10331'>was one of the knights-errant that was in the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_10332'>What are ye? said the good man. Sir, said he, I am a knight that fain</a>
<a id='line_10333'>would be counselled in the quest of the Sangreal, for he shall have</a>
<a id='line_10334'>much earthly worship that may bring it to an end. Certes, said the good</a>
<a id='line_10335'>man, that is sooth, for he shall be the best knight of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_10336'>the fairest of all the fellowship. But wit you well there shall none</a>
<a id='line_10337'>attain it but by cleanness, that is pure confession.</a>
<a id='line_10338'></a>
<a id='line_10339'>So rode they together till that they came to an hermitage. And there he</a>
<a id='line_10340'>prayed Bors to dwell all that night with him. And so he alighted and</a>
<a id='line_10341'>put away his armour, and prayed him that he might be confessed; and so</a>
<a id='line_10342'>they went into the chapel, and there he was clean confessed, and they</a>
<a id='line_10343'>ate bread and drank water together. Now, said the good man, I pray thee</a>
<a id='line_10344'>that thou eat none other till that thou sit at the table where the</a>
<a id='line_10345'>Sangreal shall be. Sir, said he, I agree me thereto, but how wit ye</a>
<a id='line_10346'>that I shall sit there. Yes, said the good man, that know I, but there</a>
<a id='line_10347'>shall be but few of your fellows with you. All is welcome, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10348'>Bors, that God sendeth me. Also, said the good man, instead of a shirt,</a>
<a id='line_10349'>and in sign of chastisement, ye shall wear a garment; therefore I pray</a>
<a id='line_10350'>you do off all your clothes and your shirt: and so he did. And then he</a>
<a id='line_10351'>took him a scarlet coat, so that should be instead of his shirt till he</a>
<a id='line_10352'>had fulfilled the quest of the Sangreal; and the good man found in him</a>
<a id='line_10353'>so marvellous a life and so stable, that he marvelled and felt that he</a>
<a id='line_10354'>was never corrupt in fleshly lusts, but in one time that he begat Elian</a>
<a id='line_10355'>le Blank.</a>
<a id='line_10356'></a>
<a id='line_10357'>Then he armed him, and took his leave, and so departed. And so a little</a>
<a id='line_10358'>from thence he looked up into a tree, and there he saw a passing great</a>
<a id='line_10359'>bird upon an old tree, and it was passing dry, without leaves; and the</a>
<a id='line_10360'>bird sat above, and had birds, the which were dead for hunger. So smote</a>
<a id='line_10361'>he himself with his beak, the which was great and sharp. And so the</a>
<a id='line_10362'>great bird bled till that he died among his birds. And the young birds</a>
<a id='line_10363'>took the life by the blood of the great bird. When Bors saw this he</a>
<a id='line_10364'>wist well it was a great tokening; for when he saw the great bird arose</a>
<a id='line_10365'>not, then he took his horse and yede his way. So by evensong, by</a>
<a id='line_10366'>adventure he came to a strong tower and an high, and there was he</a>
<a id='line_10367'>lodged gladly.</a>
<a id='line_10368'></a>

<a id='line_10373'>him for to fight against a champion for her land.</a>
<a id='line_10374'></a>
<a id='line_10375'></a>
<a id='line_10376'>And when he was unarmed they led him into an high tower where was a</a>
<a id='line_10377'>lady, young, lusty, and fair. And she received him with great joy, and</a>
<a id='line_10378'>made him to sit down by her, and so was he set to sup with flesh and</a>
<a id='line_10379'>many dainties. And when Sir Bors saw that, he bethought him on his</a>
<a id='line_10380'>penance, and bade a squire to bring him water. And so he brought him,</a>
<a id='line_10381'>and he made sops therein and ate them. Ah, said the lady, I trow ye</a>
<a id='line_10382'>like not my meat. Yes, truly, said Sir Bors, God thank you, madam, but</a>
<a id='line_10383'>I may eat none other meat this day. Then she spake no more as at that</a>
<a id='line_10384'>time, for she was loath to displease him. Then after supper they spake</a>
<a id='line_10385'>of one thing and other.</a>
<a id='line_10386'></a>
<a id='line_10387'>With that came a squire and said: Madam, ye must purvey you to-morn for</a>
<a id='line_10388'>a champion, for else your sister will have this castle and also your</a>
<a id='line_10389'>lands, except ye can find a knight that will fight to-morn in your</a>
<a id='line_10390'>quarrel against Pridam le Noire. Then she made sorrow and said: Ah,</a>
<a id='line_10391'>Lord God, wherefore granted ye to hold my land, whereof I should now be</a>
<a id='line_10392'>disherited without reason and right? And when Sir Bors had heard her</a>
<a id='line_10393'>say thus, he said: I shall comfort you. Sir, said she, I shall tell you</a>
<a id='line_10394'>there was here a king that hight Aniause, which held all this land in</a>
<a id='line_10395'>his keeping. So it mishapped he loved a gentlewoman a great deal elder</a>
<a id='line_10396'>than I. So took he her all this land to her keeping, and all his men to</a>
<a id='line_10397'>govern; and she brought up many evil customs whereby she put to death a</a>
<a id='line_10398'>great part of his kinsmen. And when he saw that, he let chase her out</a>
<a id='line_10399'>of this land, and betook it me, and all this land in my demesnes. But</a>
<a id='line_10400'>anon as that worthy king was dead, this other lady began to war upon</a>
<a id='line_10401'>me, and hath destroyed many of my men, and turned them against me, that</a>
<a id='line_10402'>I have well-nigh no man left me; and I have nought else but this high</a>
<a id='line_10403'>tower that she left me. And yet she hath promised me to have this</a>
<a id='line_10404'>tower, without I can find a knight to fight with her champion.</a>
<a id='line_10405'></a>
<a id='line_10406'>Now tell me, said Sir Bors, what is that Pridam le Noire? Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_10407'>she, he is the most doubted man of this land. Now may ye send her word</a>
<a id='line_10408'>that ye have found a knight that shall fight with that Pridam le Noire</a>
<a id='line_10409'>in God’s quarrel and yours. Then that lady was not a little glad, and</a>
<a id='line_10410'>sent word that she was purveyed, and that night Bors had good cheer;</a>
<a id='line_10411'>but in no bed he would come, but laid him on the floor, nor never would</a>
<a id='line_10412'>do otherwise till that he had met with the quest of the Sangreal.</a>

<a id='line_10418'>fought and overcame his adversary.</a>
<a id='line_10419'></a>
<a id='line_10420'></a>
<a id='line_10421'>And anon as he was asleep him befell a vision, that there came to him</a>
<a id='line_10422'>two birds, the one as white as a swan, and the other was marvellous</a>
<a id='line_10423'>black; but it was not so great as the other, but in the likeness of a</a>
<a id='line_10424'>Raven. Then the white bird came to him, and said: An thou wouldst give</a>
<a id='line_10425'>me meat and serve me I should give thee all the riches of the world,</a>
<a id='line_10426'>and I shall make thee as fair and as white as I am. So the white bird</a>
<a id='line_10427'>departed, and there came the black bird to him, and said: An thou wolt,</a>
<a id='line_10428'>serve me to-morrow and have me in no despite though I be black, for wit</a>
<a id='line_10429'>thou well that more availeth my blackness than the other’s whiteness.</a>
<a id='line_10430'>And then he departed.</a>
<a id='line_10431'></a>
<a id='line_10432'>And he had another vision: him thought that he came to a great place</a>
<a id='line_10433'>which seemed a chapel, and there he found a chair set on the left side,</a>
<a id='line_10434'>which was worm-eaten and feeble. And on the right hand were two flowers</a>
<a id='line_10435'>like a lily, and the one would have benome the other’s whiteness, but a</a>
<a id='line_10436'>good man departed them that the one touched not the other; and then out</a>
<a id='line_10437'>of every flower came out many flowers, and fruit great plenty. Then him</a>
<a id='line_10438'>thought the good man said: Should not he do great folly that would let</a>
<a id='line_10439'>these two flowers perish for to succour the rotten tree, that it fell</a>
<a id='line_10440'>not to the earth? Sir, said he, it seemeth me that this wood might not</a>
<a id='line_10441'>avail. Now keep thee, said the good man, that thou never see such</a>
<a id='line_10442'>adventure befall thee.</a>
<a id='line_10443'></a>
<a id='line_10444'>Then he awaked and made a sign of the cross in midst of the forehead,</a>
<a id='line_10445'>and so rose and clothed him. And there came the lady of the place, and</a>
<a id='line_10446'>she saluted him, and he her again, and so went to a chapel and heard</a>
<a id='line_10447'>their service. And there came a company of knights, that the lady had</a>
<a id='line_10448'>sent for, to lead Sir Bors unto battle. Then asked he his arms. And</a>
<a id='line_10449'>when he was armed she prayed him to take a little morsel to dine. Nay,</a>
<a id='line_10450'>madam, said he, that shall I not do till I have done my battle, by the</a>
<a id='line_10451'>grace of God. And so he leapt upon his horse, and departed, all the</a>
<a id='line_10452'>knights and men with him. And as soon as these two ladies met together,</a>
<a id='line_10453'>she which Bors should fight for complained her, and said: Madam, ye</a>
<a id='line_10454'>have done me wrong to bereave me of my lands that King Aniause gave me,</a>
<a id='line_10455'>and full loath I am there should be any battle. Ye shall not choose,</a>
<a id='line_10456'>said the other lady, or else your knight withdraw him.</a>
<a id='line_10457'></a>
<a id='line_10458'>Then there was the cry made, which party had the better of the two</a>
<a id='line_10459'>knights, that his lady should rejoice all the land. Now departed the</a>
<a id='line_10460'>one knight here, and the other there. Then they came together with such</a>
<a id='line_10461'>a raundon that they pierced their shields and their hauberks, and the</a>
<a id='line_10462'>spears flew in pieces, and they wounded either other sore. Then hurtled</a>
<a id='line_10463'>they together, so that they fell both to the earth, and their horses</a>
<a id='line_10464'>betwixt their legs; and anon they arose, and set hands to their swords,</a>
<a id='line_10465'>and smote each one other upon the heads, that they made great wounds</a>
<a id='line_10466'>and deep, that the blood went out of their bodies. For there found Sir</a>
<a id='line_10467'>Bors greater defence in that knight more than he weened. For that</a>
<a id='line_10468'>Pridam was a passing good knight, and he wounded Sir Bors full evil,</a>
<a id='line_10469'>and he him again; but ever this Pridam held the stour in like hard.</a>
<a id='line_10470'>That perceived Sir Bors, and suffered him till he was nigh attaint. And</a>
<a id='line_10471'>then he ran upon him more and more, and the other went back for dread</a>
<a id='line_10472'>of death. So in his withdrawing he fell upright, and Sir Bors drew his</a>
<a id='line_10473'>helm so strongly that he rent it from his head, and gave him great</a>
<a id='line_10474'>strokes with the flat of his sword upon the visage, and bade him yield</a>
<a id='line_10475'>him or he should slay him. Then he cried him mercy and said: Fair</a>
<a id='line_10476'>knight, for God’s love slay me not, and I shall ensure thee never to</a>
<a id='line_10477'>war against thy lady, but be alway toward her. Then Bors let him be;</a>
<a id='line_10478'>then the old lady fled with all her knights.</a>

<a id='line_10484'>Bors, and of his departing, and how he met Sir Lionel taken and beaten</a>
<a id='line_10485'>with thorns, and also of a maid which should have been devoured.</a>
<a id='line_10486'></a>
<a id='line_10487'></a>
<a id='line_10488'>So then came Bors to all those that held lands of his lady, and said he</a>
<a id='line_10489'>should destroy them but if they did such service unto her as longed to</a>
<a id='line_10490'>their lands. So they did their homage, and they that would not were</a>
<a id='line_10491'>chased out of their lands. Then befell that young lady to come to her</a>
<a id='line_10492'>estate again, by the mighty prowess of Sir Bors de Ganis. So when all</a>
<a id='line_10493'>the country was well set in peace, then Sir Bors took his leave and</a>
<a id='line_10494'>departed; and she thanked him greatly, and would have given him great</a>
<a id='line_10495'>riches, but he refused it.</a>
<a id='line_10496'></a>
<a id='line_10497'>Then he rode all that day till night, and came to an harbour to a lady</a>
<a id='line_10498'>which knew him well enough, and made of him great Joy. Upon the morn,</a>
<a id='line_10499'>as soon as the day appeared, Bors departed from thence, and so rode</a>
<a id='line_10500'>into a forest unto the hour of midday, and there befell him a</a>
<a id='line_10501'>marvellous adventure. So he met at the departing of the two ways two</a>
<a id='line_10502'>knights that led Lionel, his brother, all naked, bounden upon a strong</a>
<a id='line_10503'>hackney, and his hands bounden to-fore his breast. And everych of them</a>
<a id='line_10504'>held in his hands thorns wherewith they went beating him so sore that</a>
<a id='line_10505'>the blood trailed down more than in an hundred places of his body, so</a>
<a id='line_10506'>that he was all blood to-fore and behind, but he said never a word; as</a>
<a id='line_10507'>he which was great of heart he suffered all that ever they did to him,</a>
<a id='line_10508'>as though he had felt none anguish.</a>
<a id='line_10509'></a>
<a id='line_10510'>Anon Sir Bors dressed him to rescue him that was his brother; and so he</a>
<a id='line_10511'>looked upon the other side of him, and saw a knight which brought a</a>
<a id='line_10512'>fair gentlewoman, and would have set her in the thickest place of the</a>
<a id='line_10513'>forest for to have been the more surer out of the way from them that</a>
<a id='line_10514'>sought him. And she which was nothing assured cried with an high voice:</a>
<a id='line_10515'>Saint Mary succour your maid. And anon she espied where Sir Bors came</a>
<a id='line_10516'>riding. And when she came nigh him she deemed him a knight of the Round</a>
<a id='line_10517'>Table, whereof she hoped to have some comfort; and then she conjured</a>
<a id='line_10518'>him: By the faith that he ought unto Him in whose service thou art</a>
<a id='line_10519'>entered in, and for the faith ye owe unto the high order of knighthood,</a>
<a id='line_10520'>and for the noble King Arthur’s sake, that I suppose made thee knight,</a>
<a id='line_10521'>that thou help me, and suffer me not to be shamed of this knight. When</a>
<a id='line_10522'>Bors heard her say thus he had so much sorrow there he nist not what to</a>
<a id='line_10523'>do. For if I let my brother be in adventure he must be slain, and that</a>
<a id='line_10524'>would I not for all the earth. And if I help not the maid she is shamed</a>
<a id='line_10525'>for ever, and also she shall lose her virginity the which she shall</a>
<a id='line_10526'>never get again. Then lift he up his eyes and said weeping: Fair sweet</a>
<a id='line_10527'>Lord Jesu Christ, whose liege man I am, keep Lionel, my brother, that</a>
<a id='line_10528'>these knights slay him not, and for pity of you, and for Mary’s sake, I</a>
<a id='line_10529'>shall succour this maid.</a>
<a id='line_10530'></a>

<a id='line_10533'></a>
<a id='line_10534'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Bors left to rescue his brother, and rescued the</a>
<a id='line_10535'>damosel; and how it was told him that Lionel was dead.</a>
<a id='line_10536'></a>
<a id='line_10537'></a>
<a id='line_10538'>Then dressed he him unto the knight the which had the gentlewoman, and</a>
<a id='line_10539'>then he cried: Sir knight, let your hand off that maiden, or ye be but</a>
<a id='line_10540'>dead. And then he set down the maiden, and was armed at all pieces save</a>
<a id='line_10541'>he lacked his spear. Then he dressed his shield, and drew out his</a>
<a id='line_10542'>sword, and Bors smote him so hard that it went through his shield and</a>
<a id='line_10543'>habergeon on the left shoulder. And through great strength he beat him</a>
<a id='line_10544'>down to the earth, and at the pulling out of Bors’ spear there he</a>
<a id='line_10545'>swooned. Then came Bors to the maid and said: How seemeth it you? of</a>
<a id='line_10546'>this knight ye be delivered at this time. Now sir, said she, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_10547'>lead me thereas this knight had me. So shall I do gladly: and took the</a>
<a id='line_10548'>horse of the wounded knight, and set the gentlewoman upon him, and so</a>
<a id='line_10549'>brought her as she desired. Sir knight, said she, ye have better sped</a>
<a id='line_10550'>than ye weened, for an I had lost my maidenhead, five hundred men</a>
<a id='line_10551'>should have died for it. What knight was he that had you in the forest?</a>
<a id='line_10552'>By my faith, said she, he is my cousin. So wot I never with what engine</a>
<a id='line_10553'>the fiend enchafed him, for yesterday he took me from my father</a>
<a id='line_10554'>privily; for I, nor none of my father’s men, mistrusted him not, and if</a>
<a id='line_10555'>he had had my maidenhead he should have died for the sin, and his body</a>
<a id='line_10556'>shamed and dishonoured for ever. Thus as she stood talking with him</a>
<a id='line_10557'>there came twelve knights seeking after her, and anon she told them all</a>
<a id='line_10558'>how Bors had delivered her; then they made great joy, and besought him</a>
<a id='line_10559'>to come to her father, a great lord, and he should be right welcome.</a>
<a id='line_10560'>Truly, said Bors, that may not be at this time, for I have a great</a>
<a id='line_10561'>adventure to do in this country. So he commended them unto God and</a>
<a id='line_10562'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_10563'></a>
<a id='line_10564'>Then Sir Bors rode after Lionel, his brother, by the trace of their</a>
<a id='line_10565'>horses, thus he rode seeking a great while. Then he overtook a man</a>
<a id='line_10566'>clothed in a religious clothing; and rode on a strong black horse</a>
<a id='line_10567'>blacker than a berry, and said: Sir knight, what seek you? Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_10568'>he, I seek my brother that I saw within a while beaten with two</a>
<a id='line_10569'>knights. Ah, Bors, discomfort you not, nor fall into no wanhope; for I</a>
<a id='line_10570'>shall tell you tidings such as they be, for truly he is dead. Then</a>
<a id='line_10571'>showed he him a new slain body lying in a bush, and it seemed him well</a>
<a id='line_10572'>that it was the body of Lionel, and then he made such a sorrow that he</a>
<a id='line_10573'>fell to the earth all in a swoon, and lay a great while there. And when</a>
<a id='line_10574'>he came to himself he said: Fair brother, sith the company of you and</a>
<a id='line_10575'>me is departed shall I never have joy in my heart, and now He which I</a>
<a id='line_10576'>have taken unto my master, He be my help. And when he had said thus he</a>
<a id='line_10577'>took his body lightly in his arms, and put it upon the arson of his</a>
<a id='line_10578'>saddle. And then he said to the man: Canst thou tell me unto some</a>
<a id='line_10579'>chapel where that I may bury this body? Come on, said he, here is one</a>
<a id='line_10580'>fast by; and so long they rode till they saw a fair tower, and afore it</a>
<a id='line_10581'>there seemed an old feeble chapel. And then they alighted both, and put</a>
<a id='line_10582'>him into a tomb of marble.</a>
<a id='line_10583'></a>

<a id='line_10587'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Bors told his dream to a priest, which he had</a>
<a id='line_10588'>dreamed, and of the counsel that the priest gave to him.</a>
<a id='line_10589'></a>
<a id='line_10590'></a>
<a id='line_10591'>Now leave we him here, said the good man, and go we to our harbour till</a>
<a id='line_10592'>to-morrow; we will come here again to do him service. Sir, said Bors,</a>
<a id='line_10593'>be ye a priest? Yea forsooth, said he. Then I pray you tell me a dream</a>
<a id='line_10594'>that befell to me the last night. Say on, said he. Then he began so</a>
<a id='line_10595'>much to tell him of the great bird in the forest, and after told him of</a>
<a id='line_10596'>his birds, one white, another black, and of the rotten tree, and of the</a>
<a id='line_10597'>white flowers. Sir, I shall tell you a part now, and the other deal</a>
<a id='line_10598'>to-morrow. The white fowl betokeneth a gentlewoman, fair and rich,</a>
<a id='line_10599'>which loved thee paramours, and hath loved thee long; and if thou warn</a>
<a id='line_10600'>her love she shall go die anon, if thou have no pity on her. That</a>
<a id='line_10601'>signifieth the great bird, the which shall make thee to warn her. Now</a>
<a id='line_10602'>for no fear that thou hast, ne for no dread that thou hast of God, thou</a>
<a id='line_10603'>shalt not warn her, but thou wouldst not do it for to be holden chaste,</a>
<a id='line_10604'>for to conquer the loos of the vain glory of the world; for that shall</a>
<a id='line_10605'>befall thee now an thou warn her, that Launcelot, the good knight, thy</a>
<a id='line_10606'>cousin, shall die. And therefore men shall now say that thou art a</a>
<a id='line_10607'>manslayer, both of thy brother, Sir Lionel, and of thy cousin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_10608'>Launcelot du Lake, the which thou mightest have saved and rescued</a>
<a id='line_10609'>easily, but thou weenedst to rescue a maid which pertaineth nothing to</a>
<a id='line_10610'>thee. Now look thou whether it had been greater harm of thy brother’s</a>
<a id='line_10611'>death, or else to have suffered her to have lost her maidenhood. Then</a>
<a id='line_10612'>asked he him: Hast thou heard the tokens of thy dream the which I have</a>
<a id='line_10613'>told to you? Yea forsooth, said Sir Bors, all your exposition and</a>
<a id='line_10614'>declaring of my dream I have well understood and heard. Then said the</a>
<a id='line_10615'>man in this black clothing: Then is it in thy default if Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_10616'>thy cousin, die. Sir, said Bors, that were me loath, for wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_10617'>there is nothing in the world but I had liefer do it than to see my</a>
<a id='line_10618'>lord, Sir Launcelot du Lake, to die in my default. Choose ye now the</a>
<a id='line_10619'>one or the other, said the good man.</a>
<a id='line_10620'></a>
<a id='line_10621'>And then he led Sir Bors into an high tower, and there he found knights</a>
<a id='line_10622'>and ladies: those ladies said he was welcome, and so they unarmed him.</a>
<a id='line_10623'>And when he was in his doublet men brought him a mantle furred with</a>
<a id='line_10624'>ermine, and put it about him; and then they made him such cheer that he</a>
<a id='line_10625'>had forgotten all his sorrow and anguish, and only set his heart in</a>
<a id='line_10626'>these delights and dainties, and took no thought more for his brother,</a>
<a id='line_10627'>Sir Lionel, neither of Sir Launcelot du Lake, his cousin. And anon came</a>
<a id='line_10628'>out of a chamber to him the fairest lady than ever he saw, and more</a>
<a id='line_10629'>richer beseen than ever he saw Queen Guenever or any other estate. Lo,</a>
<a id='line_10630'>said they, Sir Bors, here is the lady unto whom we owe all our service,</a>
<a id='line_10631'>and I trow she be the richest lady and the fairest of all the world,</a>
<a id='line_10632'>and the which loveth you best above all other knights, for she will</a>
<a id='line_10633'>have no knight but you. And when he understood that language he was</a>
<a id='line_10634'>abashed. Not for then she saluted him, and he her; and then they sat</a>
<a id='line_10635'>down together and spake of many things, in so much that she besought</a>
<a id='line_10636'>him to be her love, for she had loved him above all earthly men, and</a>
<a id='line_10637'>she should make him richer than ever was man of his age. When Bors</a>
<a id='line_10638'>understood her words he was right evil at ease, which in no manner</a>
<a id='line_10639'>would not break chastity, so wist not he how to answer her.</a>
<a id='line_10640'></a>

<a id='line_10644'>CHAPTER XII. How the devil in a woman’s likeness would have had Sir</a>
<a id='line_10645'>Bors to have lain by her, and how by God’s grace he escaped.</a>
<a id='line_10646'></a>
<a id='line_10647'></a>
<a id='line_10648'>Alas, said she, Bors, shall ye not do my will? Madam, said Bors, there</a>
<a id='line_10649'>is no lady in the world whose will I will fulfil as of this thing, for</a>
<a id='line_10650'>my brother lieth dead which was slain right late. Ah Bors, said she, I</a>
<a id='line_10651'>have loved you long for the great beauty I have seen in you, and the</a>
<a id='line_10652'>great hardiness that I have heard of you, that needs ye must lie by me</a>
<a id='line_10653'>this night, and therefore I pray you grant it me. Truly, said he, I</a>
<a id='line_10654'>shall not do it in no manner wise. Then she made him such sorrow as</a>
<a id='line_10655'>though she would have died. Well Bors, said she, unto this have ye</a>
<a id='line_10656'>brought me, nigh to mine end. And therewith she took him by the hand,</a>
<a id='line_10657'>and bade him behold her. And ye shall see how I shall die for your</a>
<a id='line_10658'>love. Ah, said then he, that shall I never see.</a>
<a id='line_10659'></a>
<a id='line_10660'>Then she departed and went up into an high battlement, and led with her</a>
<a id='line_10661'>twelve gentlewomen; and when they were above, one of the gentlewomen</a>
<a id='line_10662'>cried, and said: Ah, Sir Bors, gentle knight have mercy on us all, and</a>
<a id='line_10663'>suffer my lady to have her will, and if ye do not we must suffer death</a>
<a id='line_10664'>with our lady, for to fall down off this high tower, and if ye suffer</a>
<a id='line_10665'>us thus to die for so little a thing all ladies and gentlewomen will</a>
<a id='line_10666'>say or you dishonour. Then looked he upward, they seemed all ladies of</a>
<a id='line_10667'>great estate, and richly and well beseen. Then had he of them great</a>
<a id='line_10668'>pity; not for that he was uncounselled in himself that liefer he had</a>
<a id='line_10669'>they all had lost their souls than he his, and with that they fell</a>
<a id='line_10670'>adown all at once unto the earth. And when he saw that, he was all</a>
<a id='line_10671'>abashed, and had thereof great marvel. With that he blessed his body</a>
<a id='line_10672'>and his visage. And anon he heard a great noise and a great cry, as</a>
<a id='line_10673'>though all the fiends of hell had been about him; and therewith he saw</a>
<a id='line_10674'>neither tower, nor lady, nor gentlewoman, nor no chapel where he</a>
<a id='line_10675'>brought his brother to. Then held he up both his hands to the heaven,</a>
<a id='line_10676'>and said: Fair Father God, I am grievously escaped; and then he took</a>
<a id='line_10677'>his arms and his horse and rode on his way.</a>
<a id='line_10678'></a>
<a id='line_10679'>Then he heard a clock smite on his right hand; and thither he came to</a>
<a id='line_10680'>an abbey on his right hand, closed with high walls, and there was let</a>
<a id='line_10681'>in. Then they supposed that he was one of the quest of the Sangreal, so</a>
<a id='line_10682'>they led him into a chamber and unarmed him. Sirs, said Sir Bors, if</a>
<a id='line_10683'>there be any holy man in this house I pray you let me speak with him.</a>
<a id='line_10684'>Then one of them led him unto the Abbot, which was in a chapel. And</a>
<a id='line_10685'>then Sir Bors saluted him, and he him again. Sir, said Bors, I am a</a>
<a id='line_10686'>knight-errant; and told him all the adventure which he had seen. Sir</a>
<a id='line_10687'>Knight, said the Abbot, I wot not what ye be, for I weened never that a</a>
<a id='line_10688'>knight of your age might have been so strong in the grace of our Lord</a>
<a id='line_10689'>Jesu Christ. Not for then ye shall go unto your rest, for I will not</a>
<a id='line_10690'>counsel you this day, it is too late, and to-morrow I shall counsel you</a>
<a id='line_10691'>as I can.</a>
<a id='line_10692'></a>

<a id='line_10696'>CHAPTER XIII. Of the holy communication of an Abbot to Sir Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_10697'>how the Abbot counselled him.</a>
<a id='line_10698'></a>
<a id='line_10699'></a>
<a id='line_10700'>And that night was Sir Bors served richly; and on the morn early he</a>
<a id='line_10701'>heard mass, and the Abbot came to him, and bade him good morrow, and</a>
<a id='line_10702'>Bors to him again. And then he told him he was a fellow of the quest of</a>
<a id='line_10703'>the Sangreal, and how he had charge of the holy man to eat bread and</a>
<a id='line_10704'>water. Then [said the Abbot]: Our Lord Jesu Christ showed him unto you</a>
<a id='line_10705'>in the likeness of a soul that suffered great anguish for us, since He</a>
<a id='line_10706'>was put upon the cross, and bled His heart-blood for mankind: there was</a>
<a id='line_10707'>the token and the likeness of the Sangreal that appeared afore you, for</a>
<a id='line_10708'>the blood that the great fowl bled revived the chickens from death to</a>
<a id='line_10709'>life. And by the bare tree is betokened the world which is naked and</a>
<a id='line_10710'>without fruit but if it come of Our Lord. Also the lady for whom ye</a>
<a id='line_10711'>fought for, and King Aniause which was lord there-to-fore, betokeneth</a>
<a id='line_10712'>Jesu Christ which is the King of the world. And that ye fought with the</a>
<a id='line_10713'>champion for the lady, this it betokeneth: for when ye took the battle</a>
<a id='line_10714'>for the lady, by her shall ye understand the new law of Jesu Christ and</a>
<a id='line_10715'>Holy Church; and by the other lady ye shall understand the old law and</a>
<a id='line_10716'>the fiend, which all day warreth against Holy Church, therefore ye did</a>
<a id='line_10717'>your battle with right. For ye be Jesu Christ’s knights, therefore ye</a>
<a id='line_10718'>ought to be defenders of Holy Church. And by the black bird might ye</a>
<a id='line_10719'>understand Holy Church, which sayeth I am black, but he is fair. And by</a>
<a id='line_10720'>the white bird might men understand the fiend, and I shall tell you how</a>
<a id='line_10721'>the swan is white without-forth, and black within: it is hypocrisy</a>
<a id='line_10722'>which is without yellow or pale, and seemeth without-forth the servants</a>
<a id='line_10723'>of Jesu Christ, but they be within so horrible of filth and sin, and</a>
<a id='line_10724'>beguile the world evil. Also when the fiend appeared to thee in</a>
<a id='line_10725'>likeness of a man of religion, and blamed thee that thou left thy</a>
<a id='line_10726'>brother for a lady, so led thee where thou seemed thy brother was</a>
<a id='line_10727'>slain, but he is yet alive; and all was for to put thee in error, and</a>
<a id='line_10728'>bring thee unto wanhope and lechery, for he knew thou were tender</a>
<a id='line_10729'>hearted, and all was for thou shouldst not find the blessed adventure</a>
<a id='line_10730'>of the Sangreal. And the third fowl betokeneth the strong battle</a>
<a id='line_10731'>against the fair ladies which were all devils. Also the dry tree and</a>
<a id='line_10732'>the white lily: the dry tree betokeneth thy brother Lionel, which is</a>
<a id='line_10733'>dry without virtue, and therefore many men ought to call him the rotten</a>
<a id='line_10734'>tree, and the worm-eaten tree, for he is a murderer and doth contrary</a>
<a id='line_10735'>to the order of knighthood. And the two white flowers signify two</a>
<a id='line_10736'>maidens, the one is a knight which was wounded the other day, and the</a>
<a id='line_10737'>other is the gentlewoman which ye rescued; and why the other flower</a>
<a id='line_10738'>drew nigh the other, that was the knight which would have defouled her</a>
<a id='line_10739'>and himself both. And Sir Bors, ye had been a great fool and in great</a>
<a id='line_10740'>peril for to have seen those two flowers perish for to succour the</a>
<a id='line_10741'>rotten tree, for an they had sinned together they had been damned; and</a>
<a id='line_10742'>for that ye rescued them both, men might call you a very knight and</a>
<a id='line_10743'>servant of Jesu Christ.</a>

<a id='line_10749'>Lionel would have slain Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_10750'></a>
<a id='line_10751'></a>
<a id='line_10752'>Then went Sir Bors from thence and commended the Abbot unto God. And</a>
<a id='line_10753'>then he rode all that day, and harboured with an old lady. And on the</a>
<a id='line_10754'>morn he rode to a castle in a valley, and there he met with a yeoman</a>
<a id='line_10755'>going a great pace toward a forest. Say me, said Sir Bors, canst thou</a>
<a id='line_10756'>tell me of any adventure? Sir, said he, here shall be under this castle</a>
<a id='line_10757'>a great and a marvellous tournament. Of what folks shall it be? said</a>
<a id='line_10758'>Sir Bors. The Earl of Plains shall be in the one party, and the lady’s</a>
<a id='line_10759'>nephew of Hervin on the other party. Then Bors thought to be there if</a>
<a id='line_10760'>he might meet with his brother Sir Lionel, or any other of his</a>
<a id='line_10761'>fellowship, which were in the quest of the Sangreal. And then he turned</a>
<a id='line_10762'>to an hermitage that was in the entry of the forest.</a>
<a id='line_10763'></a>
<a id='line_10764'>And when he was come thither he found there Sir Lionel, his brother,</a>
<a id='line_10765'>which sat all armed at the entry of the chapel door for to abide there</a>
<a id='line_10766'>harbour till on the morn that the tournament shall be. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_10767'>Bors saw him he had great joy of him, that it were marvel to tell of</a>
<a id='line_10768'>his joy. And then he alighted off his horse, and said: Fair sweet</a>
<a id='line_10769'>brother, when came ye hither? Anon as Lionel saw him he said: Ah Bors,</a>
<a id='line_10770'>ye may not make none avaunt, but as for you I might have been slain;</a>
<a id='line_10771'>when ye saw two knights leading me away beating me, ye left me for to</a>
<a id='line_10772'>succour a gentlewoman, and suffered me in peril of death; for never</a>
<a id='line_10773'>erst ne did no brother to another so great an untruth. And for that</a>
<a id='line_10774'>misdeed now I ensure you but death, for well have ye deserved it;</a>
<a id='line_10775'>therefore keep thee from henceforward, and that shall ye find as soon</a>
<a id='line_10776'>as I am armed. When Sir Bors understood his brother’s wrath he kneeled</a>
<a id='line_10777'>down to the earth and cried him mercy, holding up both his hands, and</a>
<a id='line_10778'>prayed him to forgive him his evil will. Nay, said Lionel, that shall</a>
<a id='line_10779'>never be an I may have the higher hand, that I make mine avow to God,</a>
<a id='line_10780'>thou shalt have death for it, for it were pity ye lived any longer.</a>
<a id='line_10781'></a>
<a id='line_10782'>Right so he went in and took his harness, and mounted upon his horse,</a>
<a id='line_10783'>and came to-fore him and said: Bors, keep thee from me, for I shall do</a>
<a id='line_10784'>to thee as I would to a felon or a traitor, for ye be the untruest</a>
<a id='line_10785'>knight that ever came out of so worthy an house as was King Bors de</a>
<a id='line_10786'>Ganis which was our father, therefore start upon thy horse, and so</a>
<a id='line_10787'>shall ye be most at your advantage. And but if ye will I will run upon</a>
<a id='line_10788'>you thereas ye stand upon foot, and so the shame shall be mine and the</a>
<a id='line_10789'>harm yours, but of that shame ne reck I nought.</a>
<a id='line_10790'></a>
<a id='line_10791'>When Sir Bors saw that he must fight with his brother or else to die,</a>
<a id='line_10792'>he nist what to do; then his heart counselled him not thereto, inasmuch</a>
<a id='line_10793'>as Lionel was born or he, wherefore he ought to bear him reverence; yet</a>
<a id='line_10794'>kneeled he down afore Lionel’s horse’s feet, and said: Fair sweet</a>
<a id='line_10795'>brother, have mercy upon me and slay me not, and have in remembrance</a>
<a id='line_10796'>the great love which ought to be between us twain. What Sir Bors said</a>
<a id='line_10797'>to Lionel he rought not, for the fiend had brought him in such a will</a>
<a id='line_10798'>that he should slay him. Then when Lionel saw he would none other, and</a>
<a id='line_10799'>that he would not have risen to give him battle, he rashed over him so</a>
<a id='line_10800'>that he smote Bors with his horse, feet upward, to the earth, and hurt</a>
<a id='line_10801'>him so sore that he swooned of distress, the which he felt in himself</a>
<a id='line_10802'>to have died without confession. So when Lionel saw this, he alighted</a>
<a id='line_10803'>off his horse to have smitten off his head. And so he took him by the</a>
<a id='line_10804'>helm, and would have rent it from his head. Then came the hermit</a>
<a id='line_10805'>running unto him, which was a good man and of great age, and well had</a>
<a id='line_10806'>heard all the words that were between them, and so fell down upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_10807'>Bors.</a>

<a id='line_10813'>Sir Bors, and how the hermit was slain.</a>
<a id='line_10814'></a>
<a id='line_10815'></a>
<a id='line_10816'>Then he said to Lionel: Ah gentle knight, have mercy upon me and on thy</a>
<a id='line_10817'>brother, for if thou slay him thou shalt be dead of sin, and that were</a>
<a id='line_10818'>sorrowful, for he is one of the worthiest knights of the world, and of</a>
<a id='line_10819'>the best conditions. So God help me, said Lionel, sir priest, but if ye</a>
<a id='line_10820'>flee from him I shall slay you, and he shall never the sooner be quit.</a>
<a id='line_10821'>Certes, said the good man, I have liefer ye slay me than him, for my</a>
<a id='line_10822'>death shall not be great harm, not half so much as of his. Well, said</a>
<a id='line_10823'>Lionel, I am greed; and set his hand to his sword and smote him so hard</a>
<a id='line_10824'>that his head yede backward. Not for that he restrained him of his evil</a>
<a id='line_10825'>will, but took his brother by the helm, and unlaced it to have stricken</a>
<a id='line_10826'>off his head, and had slain him without fail. But so it happed,</a>
<a id='line_10827'>Colgrevance a fellow of the Round Table, came at that time thither as</a>
<a id='line_10828'>Our Lord’s will was. And when he saw the good man slain he marvelled</a>
<a id='line_10829'>much what it might be. And then he beheld Lionel would have slain his</a>
<a id='line_10830'>brother, and knew Sir Bors which he loved right well. Then stert he</a>
<a id='line_10831'>down and took Lionel by the shoulders, and drew him strongly aback from</a>
<a id='line_10832'>Bors, and said: Lionel, will ye slay your brother, the worthiest knight</a>
<a id='line_10833'>of the world one? and that should no good man suffer. Why, said Lionel,</a>
<a id='line_10834'>will ye let me? therefore if ye entermete you in this I shall slay you,</a>
<a id='line_10835'>and him after. Why, said Colgrevance, is this sooth that ye will slay</a>
<a id='line_10836'>him? Slay him will I, said he, whoso say the contrary, for he hath done</a>
<a id='line_10837'>so much against me that he hath well deserved it. And so ran upon him,</a>
<a id='line_10838'>and would have smitten him through the head, and Sir Colgrevance ran</a>
<a id='line_10839'>betwixt them, and said: An ye be so hardy to do so more, we two shall</a>
<a id='line_10840'>meddle together.</a>
<a id='line_10841'></a>
<a id='line_10842'>When Lionel understood his words he took his shield afore him, and</a>
<a id='line_10843'>asked him what that he was. And he told him, Colgrevance, one of his</a>
<a id='line_10844'>fellows. Then Lionel defied him, and gave him a great stroke through</a>
<a id='line_10845'>the helm. Then he drew his sword, for he was a passing good knight, and</a>
<a id='line_10846'>defended him right manfully. So long dured the battle that Bors rose up</a>
<a id='line_10847'>all anguishly, and beheld [how] Colgrevance, the good knight, fought</a>
<a id='line_10848'>with his brother for his quarrel; then was he full sorry and heavy, and</a>
<a id='line_10849'>thought if Colgrevance slew him that was his brother he should never</a>
<a id='line_10850'>have joy; and if his brother slew Colgrevance the shame should ever be</a>
<a id='line_10851'>mine. Then would he have risen to have departed them, but he had not so</a>
<a id='line_10852'>much might to stand on foot; so he abode him so long till Colgrevance</a>
<a id='line_10853'>had the worse, for Lionel was of great chivalry and right hardy, for he</a>
<a id='line_10854'>had pierced the hauberk and the helm, that he abode but death, for he</a>
<a id='line_10855'>had lost much of his blood that it was marvel that he might stand</a>
<a id='line_10856'>upright. Then beheld he Sir Bors which sat dressing him upward and</a>
<a id='line_10857'>said: Ah, Bors, why come ye not to cast me out of peril of death,</a>
<a id='line_10858'>wherein I have put me to succour you which were right now nigh the</a>
<a id='line_10859'>death? Certes, said Lionel, that shall not avail you, for none of you</a>
<a id='line_10860'>shall bear others warrant, but that ye shall die both of my hand. When</a>
<a id='line_10861'>Bors heard that, he did so much, he rose and put on his helm. Then</a>
<a id='line_10862'>perceived he first the hermit-priest which was slain, then made he a</a>
<a id='line_10863'>marvellous sorrow upon him.</a>

<a id='line_10869'>would have slain Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_10870'></a>
<a id='line_10871'></a>
<a id='line_10872'>Then oft Colgrevance cried upon Sir Bors: Why will ye let me die here</a>
<a id='line_10873'>for your sake? if it please you that I die for you the death, it will</a>
<a id='line_10874'>please me the better for to save a worthy man. With that word Sir</a>
<a id='line_10875'>Lionel smote off the helm from his head. Then Colgrevance saw that he</a>
<a id='line_10876'>might not escape; then he said: Fair sweet Jesu, that I have misdone</a>
<a id='line_10877'>have mercy upon my soul, for such sorrow that my heart suffereth for</a>
<a id='line_10878'>goodness, and for alms deed that I would have done here, be to me</a>
<a id='line_10879'>aligement of penance unto my soul’s health. At these words Lionel smote</a>
<a id='line_10880'>him so sore that he bare him to the earth. So he had slain Colgrevance</a>
<a id='line_10881'>he ran upon his brother as a fiendly man, and gave him such a stroke</a>
<a id='line_10882'>that he made him stoop. And he that was full of humility prayed him for</a>
<a id='line_10883'>God’s love to leave this battle: For an it befell, fair brother, that I</a>
<a id='line_10884'>slew you or ye me, we should be dead of that sin. Never God me help but</a>
<a id='line_10885'>if I have on you mercy, an I may have the better hand. Then drew Bors</a>
<a id='line_10886'>his sword, all weeping, and said: Fair brother, God knoweth mine</a>
<a id='line_10887'>intent. Ah, fair brother, ye have done full evil this day to slay such</a>
<a id='line_10888'>an holy priest the which never trespassed. Also ye have slain a gentle</a>
<a id='line_10889'>knight, and one of our fellows. And well wot ye that I am not afeard of</a>
<a id='line_10890'>you greatly, but I dread the wrath of God, and this is an unkindly war,</a>
<a id='line_10891'>therefore God show miracle upon us both. Now God have mercy upon me</a>
<a id='line_10892'>though I defend my life against my brother: with that Bors lift up his</a>
<a id='line_10893'>hand and would have smitten his brother.</a>
<a id='line_10894'></a>

<a id='line_10898'>CHAPTER XVII. How there came a voice which charged Sir Bors to touch</a>
<a id='line_10899'>him not, and of a cloud that came between them.</a>
<a id='line_10900'></a>
<a id='line_10901'></a>
<a id='line_10902'>And then he heard a voice that said: Flee Bors, and touch him not, or</a>
<a id='line_10903'>else thou shalt slay him. Right so alighted a cloud betwixt them in</a>
<a id='line_10904'>likeness of a fire and a marvellous flame, that both their two shields</a>
<a id='line_10905'>brent. Then were they sore afraid, that they fell both to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_10906'>and lay there a great while in a swoon. And when they came to themself,</a>
<a id='line_10907'>Bors saw that his brother had no harm; then he held up both his hands,</a>
<a id='line_10908'>for he dread God had taken vengeance upon him. With that he heard a</a>
<a id='line_10909'>voice say: Bors, go hence, and bear thy brother no longer fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_10910'>but take thy way anon right to the sea, for Sir Percivale abideth thee</a>
<a id='line_10911'>there. Then he said to his brother: Fair sweet brother, forgive me for</a>
<a id='line_10912'>God’s love all that I have trespassed unto you. Then he answered: God</a>
<a id='line_10913'>forgive it thee and I do gladly.</a>
<a id='line_10914'></a>
<a id='line_10915'>So Sir Bors departed from him and rode the next way to the sea. And at</a>
<a id='line_10916'>the last by fortune he came to an abbey which was nigh the sea. That</a>
<a id='line_10917'>night Bors rested him there; and in his sleep there came a voice to him</a>
<a id='line_10918'>and bade him go to the sea. Then he stert up and made a sign of the</a>
<a id='line_10919'>cross in the midst of his forehead, and took his harness, and made</a>
<a id='line_10920'>ready his horse, and mounted upon him; and at a broken wall he rode</a>
<a id='line_10921'>out, and rode so long till that he came to the sea. And on the strand</a>
<a id='line_10922'>he found a ship covered all with white samite, and he alighted, and</a>
<a id='line_10923'>betook him to Jesu Christ. And as soon as he entered into the ship, the</a>
<a id='line_10924'>ship departed into the sea, and went so fast that him seemed the ship</a>
<a id='line_10925'>went flying, but it was soon dark so that he might know no man, and so</a>
<a id='line_10926'>he slept till it was day. Then he awaked, and saw in midst of the ship</a>
<a id='line_10927'>a knight lie all armed save his helm. Then knew he that it was Sir</a>
<a id='line_10928'>Percivale of Wales, and then he made of him right great joy; but Sir</a>
<a id='line_10929'>Percivale was abashed of him, and he asked him what he was. Ah, fair</a>
<a id='line_10930'>sir, said Bors, know ye me not? Certes, said he, I marvel how ye came</a>
<a id='line_10931'>hither, but if Our Lord brought ye hither Himself. Then Sir Bors smiled</a>
<a id='line_10932'>and did off his helm. Then Percivale knew him, and either made great</a>
<a id='line_10933'>joy of other, that it was marvel to hear. Then Bors told him how he</a>
<a id='line_10934'>came into the ship, and by whose admonishment; and either told other of</a>
<a id='line_10935'>their temptations, as ye have heard to-forehand. So went they downward</a>
<a id='line_10936'>in the sea, one while backward, another while forward, and everych</a>
<a id='line_10937'>comforted other, and oft were in their prayers. Then said Sir</a>
<a id='line_10938'>Percivale: We lack nothing but Galahad, the good knight.</a>

<a id='line_10952'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Galahad fought at a tournament, and how he was known</a>
<a id='line_10953'>of Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris.</a>
<a id='line_10954'></a>
<a id='line_10955'></a>
<a id='line_10956'>Now saith this story, when Galahad had rescued Percivale from the</a>
<a id='line_10957'>twenty knights, he yede tho into a waste forest wherein he rode many</a>
<a id='line_10958'>journeys; and he found many adventures the which he brought to an end,</a>
<a id='line_10959'>whereof the story maketh here no mention. Then he took his way to the</a>
<a id='line_10960'>sea on a day, and it befell as he passed by a castle where was a wonder</a>
<a id='line_10961'>tournament, but they without had done so much that they within were put</a>
<a id='line_10962'>to the worse, yet were they within good knights enough. When Galahad</a>
<a id='line_10963'>saw that those within were at so great a mischief that men slew them at</a>
<a id='line_10964'>the entry of the castle, then he thought to help them, and put a spear</a>
<a id='line_10965'>forth and smote the first that he fell to the earth, and the spear</a>
<a id='line_10966'>brake to pieces. Then he drew his sword and smote thereas they were</a>
<a id='line_10967'>thickest, and so he did wonderful deeds of arms that all they</a>
<a id='line_10968'>marvelled. Then it happed that Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris were with</a>
<a id='line_10969'>the knights without. But when they espied the white shield with the red</a>
<a id='line_10970'>cross the one said to the other: Yonder is the good knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_10971'>Galahad, the haut prince: now he should be a great fool which should</a>
<a id='line_10972'>meet with him to fight. So by adventure he came by Sir Gawaine, and he</a>
<a id='line_10973'>smote him so hard that he clave his helm and the coif of iron unto his</a>
<a id='line_10974'>head, so that Gawaine fell to the earth; but the stroke was so great</a>
<a id='line_10975'>that it slanted down to the earth and carved the horse’s shoulder in</a>
<a id='line_10976'>two.</a>
<a id='line_10977'></a>
<a id='line_10978'>When Ector saw Gawaine down he drew him aside, and thought it no wisdom</a>
<a id='line_10979'>for to abide him, and also for natural love, that he was his uncle.</a>
<a id='line_10980'>Thus through his great hardiness he beat aback all the knights without.</a>
<a id='line_10981'>And then they within came out and chased them all about. But when</a>
<a id='line_10982'>Galahad saw there would none turn again he stole away privily, so that</a>
<a id='line_10983'>none wist where he was become. Now by my head, said Gawaine to Ector,</a>
<a id='line_10984'>now are the wonders true that were said of Launcelot du Lake, that the</a>
<a id='line_10985'>sword which stuck in the stone should give me such a buffet that I</a>
<a id='line_10986'>would not have it for the best castle in this world; and soothly now it</a>
<a id='line_10987'>is proved true, for never ere had I such a stroke of man’s hand. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_10988'>said Ector, meseemeth your quest is done. And yours is not done, said</a>
<a id='line_10989'>Gawaine, but mine is done, I shall seek no further. Then Gawaine was</a>
<a id='line_10990'>borne into a castle and unarmed him, and laid him in a rich bed, and a</a>
<a id='line_10991'>leech found that he might live, and to be whole within a month. Thus</a>
<a id='line_10992'>Gawaine and Ector abode together, for Sir Ector would not away till</a>
<a id='line_10993'>Gawaine were whole.</a>
<a id='line_10994'></a>
<a id='line_10995'>And the good knight, Galahad, rode so long till he came that night to</a>
<a id='line_10996'>the Castle of Carboneck; and it befell him thus that he was benighted</a>
<a id='line_10997'>in an hermitage. So the good man was fain when he saw he was a</a>
<a id='line_10998'>knight-errant. Tho when they were at rest there came a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_10999'>knocking at the door, and called Galahad, and so the good man came to</a>
<a id='line_11000'>the door to wit what she would. Then she called the hermit: Sir Ulfin,</a>
<a id='line_11001'>I am a gentlewoman that would speak with the knight which is with you.</a>
<a id='line_11002'>Then the good man awaked Galahad, and bade him: Arise, and speak with a</a>
<a id='line_11003'>gentlewoman that seemeth hath great need of you. Then Galahad went to</a>
<a id='line_11004'>her and asked her what she would. Galahad, said she, I will that ye arm</a>
<a id='line_11005'>you, and mount upon your horse and follow me, for I shall show you</a>
<a id='line_11006'>within these three days the highest adventure that ever any knight saw.</a>
<a id='line_11007'>Anon Galahad armed him, and took his horse, and commended him to God,</a>
<a id='line_11008'>and bade the gentlewoman go, and he would follow thereas she liked.</a>

<a id='line_11013'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Galahad rode with a damosel, and came to the ship</a>
<a id='line_11014'>whereas Sir Bors and Sir Percivale were in.</a>
<a id='line_11015'></a>
<a id='line_11016'></a>
<a id='line_11017'>So she rode as fast as her palfrey might bear her, till that she came</a>
<a id='line_11018'>to the sea, the which was called Collibe. And at the night they came</a>
<a id='line_11019'>unto a castle in a valley, closed with a running water, and with strong</a>
<a id='line_11020'>walls and high; and so she entered into the castle with Galahad, and</a>
<a id='line_11021'>there had he great cheer, for the lady of that castle was the damosel’s</a>
<a id='line_11022'>lady. So when he was unarmed, then said the damosel: Madam, shall we</a>
<a id='line_11023'>abide here all this day? Nay, said she, but till he hath dined and till</a>
<a id='line_11024'>he hath slept a little. So he ate and slept a while till that the maid</a>
<a id='line_11025'>called him, and armed him by torchlight. And when the maid was horsed</a>
<a id='line_11026'>and he both, the lady took Galahad a fair child and rich; and so they</a>
<a id='line_11027'>departed from the castle till they came to the seaside; and there they</a>
<a id='line_11028'>found the ship where Bors and Percivale were in, the which cried on the</a>
<a id='line_11029'>ship’s board: Sir Galahad, ye be welcome, we have abiden you long. And</a>
<a id='line_11030'>when he heard them he asked them what they were. Sir, said she, leave</a>
<a id='line_11031'>your horse here, and I shall leave mine; and took their saddles and</a>
<a id='line_11032'>their bridles with them, and made a cross on them, and so entered into</a>
<a id='line_11033'>the ship. And the two knights received them both with great joy, and</a>
<a id='line_11034'>everych knew other; and so the wind arose, and drove them through the</a>
<a id='line_11035'>sea in a marvellous pace. And within a while it dawned.</a>
<a id='line_11036'></a>
<a id='line_11037'>Then did Galahad off his helm and his sword, and asked of his fellows</a>
<a id='line_11038'>from whence came that fair ship. Truly, said they, ye wot as well as</a>
<a id='line_11039'>we, but of God’s grace; and then they told everych to other of all</a>
<a id='line_11040'>their hard adventures, and of their great temptations. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_11041'>Galahad, ye are much bounden to God, for ye have escaped great</a>
<a id='line_11042'>adventures; and had not the gentlewoman been I had not come here, for</a>
<a id='line_11043'>as for you I weened never to have found you in these strange countries.</a>
<a id='line_11044'>Ah Galahad, said Bors, if Launcelot, your father, were here then were</a>
<a id='line_11045'>we well at ease, for then meseemed we failed nothing. That may not be,</a>
<a id='line_11046'>said Galahad, but if it pleased Our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_11047'></a>
<a id='line_11048'>By then the ship went from the land of Logris, and by adventure it</a>
<a id='line_11049'>arrived up betwixt two rocks passing great and marvellous; but there</a>
<a id='line_11050'>they might not land, for there was a swallow of the sea, save there was</a>
<a id='line_11051'>another ship, and upon it they might go without danger. Go we thither,</a>
<a id='line_11052'>said the gentlewoman, and there shall we see adventures, for so is Our</a>
<a id='line_11053'>Lord’s will. And when they came thither they found the ship rich</a>
<a id='line_11054'>enough, but they found neither man nor woman therein. But they found in</a>
<a id='line_11055'>the end of the ship two fair letters written, which said a dreadful</a>
<a id='line_11056'>word and a marvellous: Thou man, which shall enter into this ship,</a>
<a id='line_11057'>beware thou be in steadfast belief, for I am Faith, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_11058'>beware how thou enterest, for an thou fail I shall not help thee. Then</a>
<a id='line_11059'>said the gentlewoman: Percivale, wot ye what I am? Certes, said he,</a>
<a id='line_11060'>nay, to my witting. Wit ye well, said she, that I am thy sister, which</a>
<a id='line_11061'>am daughter of King Pellinore, and therefore wit ye well ye are the man</a>
<a id='line_11062'>in the world that I most love; and if ye be not in perfect belief of</a>
<a id='line_11063'>Jesu Christ enter not in no manner of wise, for then should ye perish</a>
<a id='line_11064'>the ship, for he is so perfect he will suffer no sinner in him. When</a>
<a id='line_11065'>Percivale understood that she was his very sister he was inwardly glad,</a>
<a id='line_11066'>and said: Fair sister, I shall enter therein, for if I be a miscreature</a>
<a id='line_11067'>or an untrue knight there shall I perish.</a>

<a id='line_11072'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Galahad entered into the ship, and of a fair bed</a>
<a id='line_11073'>therein, with other marvellous things, and of a sword.</a>
<a id='line_11074'></a>
<a id='line_11075'></a>
<a id='line_11076'>In the meanwhile Galahad blessed him, and entered therein; and then</a>
<a id='line_11077'>next the gentlewoman, and then Sir Bors and Sir Percivale. And when</a>
<a id='line_11078'>they were in, it was so marvellous fair and rich that they marvelled;</a>
<a id='line_11079'>and in midst of the ship was a fair bed, and Galahad went thereto, and</a>
<a id='line_11080'>found there a crown of silk. And at the feet was a sword, rich and</a>
<a id='line_11081'>fair, and it was drawn out of the sheath half a foot and more; and the</a>
<a id='line_11082'>sword was of divers fashions, and the pommel was of stone, and there</a>
<a id='line_11083'>was in him all manner of colours that any man might find, and everych</a>
<a id='line_11084'>of the colours had divers virtues; and the scales of the haft were of</a>
<a id='line_11085'>two ribs of divers beasts, the one beast was a serpent which was</a>
<a id='line_11086'>conversant in Calidone, and is called the Serpent of the fiend; and the</a>
<a id='line_11087'>bone of him is of such a virtue that there is no hand that handleth him</a>
<a id='line_11088'>shall never be weary nor hurt. And the other beast is a fish which is</a>
<a id='line_11089'>not right great, and haunteth the flood of Euphrates; and that fish is</a>
<a id='line_11090'>called Ertanax, and his bones be of such a manner of kind that who that</a>
<a id='line_11091'>handleth them shall have so much will that he shall never be weary, and</a>
<a id='line_11092'>he shall not think on joy nor sorrow that he hath had but only that</a>
<a id='line_11093'>thing that he beholdeth before him. And as for this sword there shall</a>
<a id='line_11094'>never man begrip him at the handles but one; but he shall pass all</a>
<a id='line_11095'>other. In the name of God, said Percivale, I shall assay to handle it.</a>
<a id='line_11096'>So he set his hand to the sword, but he might not begrip it. By my</a>
<a id='line_11097'>faith, said he, now have I failed. Bors set his hand thereto and</a>
<a id='line_11098'>failed.</a>
<a id='line_11099'></a>
<a id='line_11100'>Then Galahad beheld the sword and saw letters like blood that said: Let</a>
<a id='line_11101'>see who shall assay to draw me out of my sheath, but if he be more</a>
<a id='line_11102'>hardier than any other; and who that draweth me, wit ye well that he</a>
<a id='line_11103'>shall never fail of shame of his body, or to be wounded to the death.</a>
<a id='line_11104'>By my faith, said Galahad, I would draw this sword out of the sheath,</a>
<a id='line_11105'>but the offending is so great that I shall not set my hand thereto. Now</a>
<a id='line_11106'>sirs, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well that the drawing of this sword</a>
<a id='line_11107'>is warned to all men save all only to you. Also this ship arrived in</a>
<a id='line_11108'>the realm of Logris; and that time was deadly war between King Labor,</a>
<a id='line_11109'>which was father unto the maimed king, and King Hurlame, which was a</a>
<a id='line_11110'>Saracen. But then was he newly christened, so that men held him</a>
<a id='line_11111'>afterward one of the wittiest men of the world. And so upon a day it</a>
<a id='line_11112'>befell that King Labor and King Hurlame had assembled their folk upon</a>
<a id='line_11113'>the sea where this ship was arrived; and there King Hurlame was</a>
<a id='line_11114'>discomfit, and his men slain; and he was afeard to be dead, and fled to</a>
<a id='line_11115'>his ship, and there found this sword and drew it, and came out and</a>
<a id='line_11116'>found King Labor, the man in the world of all Christendom in whom was</a>
<a id='line_11117'>then the greatest faith. And when King Hurlame saw King Labor he</a>
<a id='line_11118'>dressed this sword, and smote him upon the helm so hard that he clave</a>
<a id='line_11119'>him and his horse to the earth with the first stroke of his sword. And</a>
<a id='line_11120'>it was in the realm of Logris; and so befell great pestilence and great</a>
<a id='line_11121'>harm to both realms. For sithen increased neither corn, nor grass, nor</a>
<a id='line_11122'>well-nigh no fruit, nor in the water was no fish; wherefore men call it</a>
<a id='line_11123'>the lands of the two marches, the waste land, for that dolorous stroke.</a>
<a id='line_11124'>And when King Hurlame saw this sword so carving, he turned again to</a>
<a id='line_11125'>fetch the scabbard, and so came into this ship and entered, and put up</a>
<a id='line_11126'>the sword in the sheath. And as soon as he had done it he fell down</a>
<a id='line_11127'>dead afore the bed. Thus was the sword proved, that none ne drew it but</a>
<a id='line_11128'>he were dead or maimed. So lay he there till a maiden came into the</a>
<a id='line_11129'>ship and cast him out, for there was no man so hardy of the world to</a>
<a id='line_11130'>enter into that ship for the defence.</a>

<a id='line_11136'></a>
<a id='line_11137'></a>
<a id='line_11138'>And then beheld they the scabbard, it seemed to be of a serpent’s skin,</a>
<a id='line_11139'>and thereon were letters of gold and silver. And the girdle was but</a>
<a id='line_11140'>poorly to come to, and not able to sustain such a rich sword. And the</a>
<a id='line_11141'>letters said: He which shall wield me sought to be more harder than any</a>
<a id='line_11142'>other, if he bear me as truly as me ought to be borne. For the body of</a>
<a id='line_11143'>him which I ought to hang by, he shall not be shamed in no place while</a>
<a id='line_11144'>he is girt with this girdle, nor never none be so hardy to do away this</a>
<a id='line_11145'>girdle; for it ought not be done away but by the hands of a maid, and</a>
<a id='line_11146'>that she be a king’s daughter and queen’s, and she must be a maid all</a>
<a id='line_11147'>the days of her life, both in will and in deed. And if she break her</a>
<a id='line_11148'>virginity she shall die the most villainous death that ever died any</a>
<a id='line_11149'>woman. Sir, said Percivale, turn this sword that we may see what is on</a>
<a id='line_11150'>the other side. And it was red as blood, with black letters as any</a>
<a id='line_11151'>coal, which said: He that shall praise me most, most shall he find me</a>
<a id='line_11152'>to blame at a great need; and to whom I should be most debonair shall I</a>
<a id='line_11153'>be most felon, and that shall be at one time.</a>
<a id='line_11154'></a>
<a id='line_11155'>Fair brother, said she to Percivale, it befell after a forty year after</a>
<a id='line_11156'>the passion of Jesu Christ that Nacien, the brother-in-law of King</a>
<a id='line_11157'>Mordrains, was borne into a town more than fourteen days’ journey from</a>
<a id='line_11158'>his country, by the commandment of Our Lord, into an isle, into the</a>
<a id='line_11159'>parts of the West, that men cleped the Isle of Turnance. So befell it</a>
<a id='line_11160'>that he found this ship at the entry of a rock, and he found the bed</a>
<a id='line_11161'>and this sword as we have heard now. Not for then he had not so much</a>
<a id='line_11162'>hardiness to draw it; and there he dwelled an eight days, and at the</a>
<a id='line_11163'>ninth day there fell a great wind which departed him out of the isle,</a>
<a id='line_11164'>and brought him to another isle by a rock, and there he found the</a>
<a id='line_11165'>greatest giant that ever man might see. Therewith came that horrible</a>
<a id='line_11166'>giant to slay him; and then he looked about him and might not flee, and</a>
<a id='line_11167'>he had nothing to defend him with. So he ran to his sword, and when he</a>
<a id='line_11168'>saw it naked he praised it much, and then he shook it, and therewith he</a>
<a id='line_11169'>brake it in the midst. Ah, said Nacien, the thing that I most praised</a>
<a id='line_11170'>ought I now most to blame, and therewith he threw the pieces of his</a>
<a id='line_11171'>sword over his bed. And after he leapt over the board to fight with the</a>
<a id='line_11172'>giant, and slew him.</a>
<a id='line_11173'></a>
<a id='line_11174'>And anon he entered into the ship again, and the wind arose, and drove</a>
<a id='line_11175'>him through the sea, that by adventure he came to another ship where</a>
<a id='line_11176'>King Mordrains was, which had been tempted full evil with a fiend in</a>
<a id='line_11177'>the Port of Perilous Rock. And when that one saw the other they made</a>
<a id='line_11178'>great joy of other, and either told other of their adventure, and how</a>
<a id='line_11179'>the sword failed him at his most need. When Mordrains saw the sword he</a>
<a id='line_11180'>praised it much: But the breaking was not to do but by wickedness of</a>
<a id='line_11181'>thy selfward, for thou art in some sin. And there he took the sword,</a>
<a id='line_11182'>and set the pieces together, and they soldered as fair as ever they</a>
<a id='line_11183'>were to-fore; and there put he the sword in the sheath, and laid it</a>
<a id='line_11184'>down on the bed. Then heard they a voice that said: Go out of this ship</a>
<a id='line_11185'>a little while, and enter into the other, for dread ye fall in deadly</a>
<a id='line_11186'>sin, for and ye be found in deadly sin ye may not escape but perish:</a>
<a id='line_11187'>and so they went into the other ship. And as Nacien went over the board</a>
<a id='line_11188'>he was smitten with a sword on the right foot, that he fell down</a>
<a id='line_11189'>noseling to the ship’s board; and therewith he said: O God, how am I</a>
<a id='line_11190'>hurt. And then there came a voice and said: Take thou that for thy</a>
<a id='line_11191'>forfeit that thou didst in drawing of this sword, therefore thou</a>
<a id='line_11192'>receivest a wound, for thou were never worthy to handle it, as the</a>
<a id='line_11193'>writing maketh mention. In the name of God, said Galahad, ye are right</a>
<a id='line_11194'>wise of these works.</a>

<a id='line_11200'>drew the sword, and other marvellous histories.</a>
<a id='line_11201'></a>
<a id='line_11202'></a>
<a id='line_11203'>Sir, said she, there was a king that hight Pelles, the maimed king. And</a>
<a id='line_11204'>while he might ride he supported much Christendom and Holy Church. So</a>
<a id='line_11205'>upon a day he hunted in a wood of his which lasted unto the sea; and at</a>
<a id='line_11206'>the last he lost his hounds and his knights save only one: and there he</a>
<a id='line_11207'>and his knight went till that they came toward Ireland, and there he</a>
<a id='line_11208'>found the ship. And when he saw the letters and understood them, yet he</a>
<a id='line_11209'>entered, for he was right perfect of his life, but his knight had none</a>
<a id='line_11210'>hardiness to enter; and there found he this sword, and drew it out as</a>
<a id='line_11211'>much as ye may see. So therewith entered a spear wherewith he was</a>
<a id='line_11212'>smitten him through both the thighs, and never sith might he be healed,</a>
<a id='line_11213'>nor nought shall to-fore we come to him. Thus, said she, was not King</a>
<a id='line_11214'>Pelles, your grandsire, maimed for his hardiness? In the name of God,</a>
<a id='line_11215'>damosel, said Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_11216'></a>
<a id='line_11217'>So they went toward the bed to behold all about it, and above the head</a>
<a id='line_11218'>there hung two swords. Also there were two spindles which were as white</a>
<a id='line_11219'>as any snow, and other that were as red as blood, and other above green</a>
<a id='line_11220'>as any emerald: of these three colours were the spindles, and of</a>
<a id='line_11221'>natural colour within, and without any painting. These spindles, said</a>
<a id='line_11222'>the damosel, were when sinful Eve came to gather fruit, for which Adam</a>
<a id='line_11223'>and she were put out of paradise, she took with her the bough on which</a>
<a id='line_11224'>the apple hung on. Then perceived she that the branch was fair and</a>
<a id='line_11225'>green, and she remembered her the loss which came from the tree. Then</a>
<a id='line_11226'>she thought to keep the branch as long as she might. And for she had no</a>
<a id='line_11227'>coffer to keep it in, she put it in the earth. So by the will of Our</a>
<a id='line_11228'>Lord the branch grew to a great tree within a little while, and was as</a>
<a id='line_11229'>white as any snow, branches, boughs, and leaves: that was a token a</a>
<a id='line_11230'>maiden planted it. But after God came to Adam, and bade him know his</a>
<a id='line_11231'>wife fleshly as nature required. So lay Adam with his wife under the</a>
<a id='line_11232'>same tree; and anon the tree which was white was full green as any</a>
<a id='line_11233'>grass, and all that came out of it; and in the same time that they</a>
<a id='line_11234'>medled together there was Abel begotten: thus was the tree long of</a>
<a id='line_11235'>green colour. And so it befell many days after, under the same tree</a>
<a id='line_11236'>Caym slew Abel, whereof befell great marvel. For anon as Abel had</a>
<a id='line_11237'>received the death under the green tree, it lost the green colour and</a>
<a id='line_11238'>became red; and that was in tokening of the blood. And anon all the</a>
<a id='line_11239'>plants died thereof, but the tree grew and waxed marvellously fair, and</a>
<a id='line_11240'>it was the fairest tree and the most delectable that any man might</a>
<a id='line_11241'>behold and see; and so died the plants that grew out of it to-fore that</a>
<a id='line_11242'>Abel was slain under it. So long dured the tree till that Solomon, King</a>
<a id='line_11243'>David’s son, reigned, and held the land after his father. This Solomon</a>
<a id='line_11244'>was wise and knew all the virtues of stones and trees, and so he knew</a>
<a id='line_11245'>the course of the stars, and many other divers things. This Solomon had</a>
<a id='line_11246'>an evil wife, wherethrough he weened that there had been no good woman,</a>
<a id='line_11247'>and so he despised them in his books. So answered a voice him once:</a>
<a id='line_11248'>Solomon, if heaviness come to a man by a woman, ne reck thou never; for</a>
<a id='line_11249'>yet shall there come a woman whereof there shall come greater joy to</a>
<a id='line_11250'>man an hundred times more than this heaviness giveth sorrow; and that</a>
<a id='line_11251'>woman shall be born of thy lineage. Tho when Solomon heard these words</a>
<a id='line_11252'>he held himself but a fool, and the truth he perceived by old books.</a>
<a id='line_11253'>Also the Holy Ghost showed him the coming of the glorious Virgin Mary.</a>
<a id='line_11254'>Then asked he of the voice, if it should be in the yerde of his</a>
<a id='line_11255'>lineage. Nay, said the voice, but there shall come a man which shall be</a>
<a id='line_11256'>a maid, and the last of your blood, and he shall be as good a knight as</a>
<a id='line_11257'>Duke Josua, thy brother-in-law.</a>
<a id='line_11258'></a>

<a id='line_11263'>and of other matters marvellous.</a>
<a id='line_11264'></a>
<a id='line_11265'></a>
<a id='line_11266'>Now have I certified thee of that thou stoodest in doubt. Then was</a>
<a id='line_11267'>Solomon glad that there should come any such of his lineage; but ever</a>
<a id='line_11268'>he marvelled and studied who that should be, and what his name might</a>
<a id='line_11269'>be. His wife perceived that he studied, and thought she would know it</a>
<a id='line_11270'>at some season; and so she waited her time, and asked of him the cause</a>
<a id='line_11271'>of his studying, and there he told her altogether how the voice told</a>
<a id='line_11272'>him. Well, said she, I shall let make a ship of the best wood and most</a>
<a id='line_11273'>durable that men may find. So Solomon sent for all the carpenters of</a>
<a id='line_11274'>the land, and the best. And when they had made the ship the lady said</a>
<a id='line_11275'>to Solomon: Sir, said she, since it is so that this knight ought to</a>
<a id='line_11276'>pass all knights of chivalry which have been to-fore him and shall come</a>
<a id='line_11277'>after him, moreover I shall tell you, said she, ye shall go into Our</a>
<a id='line_11278'>Lord’s temple, where is King David’s sword, your father, the which is</a>
<a id='line_11279'>the marvelloust and the sharpest that ever was taken in any knight’s</a>
<a id='line_11280'>hand. Therefore take that, and take off the pommel, and thereto make ye</a>
<a id='line_11281'>a pommel of precious stones, that it be so subtly made that no man</a>
<a id='line_11282'>perceive it but that they be all one; and after make there an hilt so</a>
<a id='line_11283'>marvellously and wonderly that no man may know it; and after make a</a>
<a id='line_11284'>marvellous sheath. And when ye have made all this I shall let make a</a>
<a id='line_11285'>girdle thereto, such as shall please me.</a>
<a id='line_11286'></a>
<a id='line_11287'>All this King Solomon did let make as she devised, both the ship and</a>
<a id='line_11288'>all the remnant. And when the ship was ready in the sea to sail, the</a>
<a id='line_11289'>lady let make a great bed and marvellous rich, and set her upon the</a>
<a id='line_11290'>bed’s head, covered with silk, and laid the sword at the feet, and the</a>
<a id='line_11291'>girdles were of hemp, and therewith the king was angry. Sir, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_11292'>well, said she, that I have none so high a thing which were worthy to</a>
<a id='line_11293'>sustain so high a sword, and a maid shall bring other knights thereto,</a>
<a id='line_11294'>but I wot not when it shall be, nor what time. And there she let make a</a>
<a id='line_11295'>covering to the ship, of cloth of silk that should never rot for no</a>
<a id='line_11296'>manner of weather. Yet went that lady and made a carpenter to come to</a>
<a id='line_11297'>the tree which Abel was slain under. Now, said she, carve me out of</a>
<a id='line_11298'>this tree as much wood as will make me a spindle. Ah madam, said he,</a>
<a id='line_11299'>this is the tree the which our first mother planted. Do it, said she,</a>
<a id='line_11300'>or else I shall destroy thee. Anon as he began to work there came out</a>
<a id='line_11301'>drops of blood; and then would he have left, but she would not suffer</a>
<a id='line_11302'>him, and so he took away as much wood as might make a spindle: and so</a>
<a id='line_11303'>she made him to take as much of the green tree and of the white tree.</a>
<a id='line_11304'>And when these three spindles were shapen she made them to be fastened</a>
<a id='line_11305'>upon the selar of the bed. When Solomon saw this, he said to his wife:</a>
<a id='line_11306'>Ye have done marvellously, for though all the world were here right</a>
<a id='line_11307'>now, he could not devise wherefore all this was made, but Our Lord</a>
<a id='line_11308'>Himself; and thou that hast done it wottest not what it shall betoken.</a>
<a id='line_11309'>Now let it be, said she, for ye shall hear tidings sooner than ye ween.</a>

<a id='line_11319'>he was asleep him thought there came from heaven a great company of</a>
<a id='line_11320'>angels, and alighted into the ship, and took water which was brought by</a>
<a id='line_11321'>an angel, in a vessel of silver, and sprent all the ship. And after he</a>
<a id='line_11322'>came to the sword, and drew letters on the hilt. And after went to the</a>
<a id='line_11323'>ship’s board, and wrote there other letters which said: Thou man that</a>
<a id='line_11324'>wilt enter within me, beware that thou be full within the faith, for I</a>
<a id='line_11325'>ne am but Faith and Belief. When Solomon espied these letters he was</a>
<a id='line_11326'>abashed, so that he durst not enter, and so drew him aback; and the</a>
<a id='line_11327'>ship was anon shoven in the sea, and he went so fast that he lost sight</a>
<a id='line_11328'>of him within a little while. And then a little voice said: Solomon,</a>
<a id='line_11329'>the last knight of thy lineage shall rest in this bed. Then went</a>
<a id='line_11330'>Solomon and awaked his wife, and told her of the adventures of the</a>
<a id='line_11331'>ship.</a>
<a id='line_11332'></a>
<a id='line_11333'>Now saith the history that a great while the three fellows beheld the</a>
<a id='line_11334'>bed and the three spindles. Then they were at certain that they were of</a>
<a id='line_11335'>natural colours without painting. Then they lift up a cloth which was</a>
<a id='line_11336'>above the ground, and there found a rich purse by seeming. And</a>
<a id='line_11337'>Percivale took it, and found therein a writ and so he read it, and</a>
<a id='line_11338'>devised the manner of the spindles and of the ship, whence it came, and</a>
<a id='line_11339'>by whom it was made. Now, said Galahad, where shall we find the</a>
<a id='line_11340'>gentlewoman that shall make new girdles to the sword? Fair sir, said</a>
<a id='line_11341'>Percivale’s sister, dismay you not, for by the leave of God I shall let</a>
<a id='line_11342'>make a girdle to the sword, such one as shall long thereto. And then</a>
<a id='line_11343'>she opened a box, and took out girdles which were seemly wrought with</a>
<a id='line_11344'>golden threads, and upon that were set full precious stones, and a rich</a>
<a id='line_11345'>buckle of gold. Lo, lords, said she, here is a girdle that ought to be</a>
<a id='line_11346'>set about the sword. And wit ye well the greatest part of this girdle</a>
<a id='line_11347'>was made of my hair, which I loved well while that I was a woman of the</a>
<a id='line_11348'>world. But as soon as I wist that this adventure was ordained me I</a>
<a id='line_11349'>clipped off my hair, and made this girdle in the name of God. Ye be</a>
<a id='line_11350'>well found, said Sir Bors, for certes ye have put us out of great pain,</a>
<a id='line_11351'>wherein we should have entered ne had your tidings been.</a>
<a id='line_11352'></a>
<a id='line_11353'>Then went the gentlewoman and set it on the girdle of the sword. Now,</a>
<a id='line_11354'>said the fellowship, what is the name of the sword, and what shall we</a>
<a id='line_11355'>call it? Truly, said she, the name of the sword is the Sword with the</a>
<a id='line_11356'>Strange Girdles; and the sheath, Mover of Blood; for no man that hath</a>
<a id='line_11357'>blood in him ne shall never see the one part of the sheath which was</a>
<a id='line_11358'>made of the Tree of Life. Then they said to Galahad: In the name of</a>
<a id='line_11359'>Jesu Christ, and pray you that ye gird you with this sword which hath</a>
<a id='line_11360'>been desired so much in the realm of Logris. Now let me begin, said</a>
<a id='line_11361'>Galahad, to grip this sword for to give you courage; but wit ye well it</a>
<a id='line_11362'>longeth no more to me than it doth to you. And then he gripped about it</a>
<a id='line_11363'>with his fingers a great deal; and then she girt him about the middle</a>
<a id='line_11364'>with the sword. Now reck I not though I die, for now I hold me one of</a>
<a id='line_11365'>the blessed maidens of the world, which hath made the worthiest knight</a>
<a id='line_11366'>of the world. Damosel, said Galahad, ye have done so much that I shall</a>
<a id='line_11367'>be your knight all the days of my life.</a>
<a id='line_11368'></a>
<a id='line_11369'>Then they went from that ship, and went to the other. And anon the wind</a>
<a id='line_11370'>drove them into the sea a great pace, but they had no victuals: but it</a>
<a id='line_11371'>befell that they came on the morn to a castle that men call Carteloise,</a>
<a id='line_11372'>that was in the marches of Scotland. And when they had passed the port,</a>
<a id='line_11373'>the gentlewoman said: Lords, here be men arriven that, an they wist</a>
<a id='line_11374'>that ye were of King Arthur’s court, ye should be assailed anon.</a>
<a id='line_11375'>Damosel, said Galahad, He that cast us out of the rock shall deliver us</a>
<a id='line_11376'>from them.</a>
<a id='line_11377'></a>
<a id='line_11378'></a>
<a id='line_11379'></a>
<a id='line_11380'></a>
<a id='line_11381'>CHAPTER VIII. How Galahad and his fellows came to a castle, and how</a>
<a id='line_11382'>they were fought withal, and how they slew their adversaries, and other</a>
<a id='line_11383'>matters.</a>
<a id='line_11384'></a>
<a id='line_11385'></a>
<a id='line_11386'>So it befell as they spoke thus there came a squire by them, and asked</a>
<a id='line_11387'>what they were; and they said they were of King Arthur’s house. Is that</a>
<a id='line_11388'>sooth? said he. Now by my head, said he, ye be ill arrayed; and then</a>
<a id='line_11389'>turned he again unto the cliff fortress. And within a while they heard</a>
<a id='line_11390'>an horn blow. Then a gentlewoman came to them, and asked them of whence</a>
<a id='line_11391'>they were; and they told her. Fair lords, said she, for God’s love turn</a>
<a id='line_11392'>again if ye may, for ye be come unto your death. Nay, they said, we</a>
<a id='line_11393'>will not turn again, for He shall help us in whose service we be</a>
<a id='line_11394'>entered in. Then as they stood talking there came knights well armed,</a>
<a id='line_11395'>and bade them yield them or else to die. That yielding, said they,</a>
<a id='line_11396'>shall be noyous to you. And therewith they let their horses run, and</a>
<a id='line_11397'>Sir Percivale smote the foremost to the earth, and took his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_11398'>mounted thereupon, and the same did Galahad. Also Bors served another</a>
<a id='line_11399'>so, for they had no horses in that country, for they left their horses</a>
<a id='line_11400'>when they took their ship in other countries. And so when they were</a>
<a id='line_11401'>horsed then began they to set upon them; and they of the castle fled</a>
<a id='line_11402'>into the strong fortress, and the three knights after them into the</a>
<a id='line_11403'>castle, and so alighted on foot, and with their swords slew them down,</a>
<a id='line_11404'>and gat into the hall.</a>
<a id='line_11405'></a>
<a id='line_11406'>Then when they beheld the great multitude of people that they had</a>
<a id='line_11407'>slain, they held themself great sinners. Certes, said Bors, I ween an</a>
<a id='line_11408'>God had loved them that we should not have had power to have slain them</a>
<a id='line_11409'>thus. But they have done so much against Our Lord that He would not</a>
<a id='line_11410'>suffer them to reign no longer. Say ye not so, said Galahad, for if</a>
<a id='line_11411'>they misdid against God, the vengeance is not ours, but to Him which</a>
<a id='line_11412'>hath power thereof.</a>
<a id='line_11413'></a>
<a id='line_11414'>So came there out of a chamber a good man which was a priest, and bare</a>
<a id='line_11415'>God’s body in a cup. And when he saw them which lay dead in the hall he</a>
<a id='line_11416'>was all abashed; and Galahad did off his helm and kneeled down, and so</a>
<a id='line_11417'>did his two fellows. Sir, said they, have ye no dread of us, for we be</a>
<a id='line_11418'>of King Arthur’s court. Then asked the good man how they were slain so</a>
<a id='line_11419'>suddenly, and they told it him. Truly, said the good man, an ye might</a>
<a id='line_11420'>live as long as the world might endure, ne might ye have done so great</a>
<a id='line_11421'>an alms-deed as this. Sir, said Galahad, I repent me much, inasmuch as</a>
<a id='line_11422'>they were christened. Nay, repent you not, said he, for they were not</a>
<a id='line_11423'>christened, and I shall tell you how that I wot of this castle. Here</a>
<a id='line_11424'>was Lord Earl Hernox not but one year, and he had three sons, good</a>
<a id='line_11425'>knights of arms, and a daughter, the fairest gentlewoman that men knew.</a>
<a id='line_11426'>So those three knights loved their sister so sore that they brent in</a>
<a id='line_11427'>love, and so they lay by her, maugre her head. And for she cried to her</a>
<a id='line_11428'>father they slew her, and took their father and put him in prison, and</a>
<a id='line_11429'>wounded him nigh to the death, but a cousin of hers rescued him. And</a>
<a id='line_11430'>then did they great untruth: they slew clerks and priests, and made</a>
<a id='line_11431'>beat down chapels, that Our Lord’s service might not be served nor</a>
<a id='line_11432'>said. And this same day her father sent to me for to be confessed and</a>
<a id='line_11433'>houseled; but such shame had never man as I had this day with the three</a>
<a id='line_11434'>brethren, but the earl bade me suffer, for he said they should not long</a>
<a id='line_11435'>endure, for three servants of Our Lord should destroy them, and now it</a>
<a id='line_11436'>is brought to an end. And by this may ye wit that Our Lord is not</a>
<a id='line_11437'>displeased with your deeds. Certes, said Galahad, an it had not pleased</a>
<a id='line_11438'>Our Lord, never should we have slain so many men in so little a while.</a>
<a id='line_11439'></a>
<a id='line_11440'>And then they brought the Earl Hernox out of prison into the midst of</a>
<a id='line_11441'>the hall, that knew Galahad anon, and yet he saw him never afore but by</a>
<a id='line_11442'>revelation of Our Lord.</a>
<a id='line_11443'></a>
<a id='line_11444'></a>
<a id='line_11445'></a>
<a id='line_11446'></a>
<a id='line_11447'>CHAPTER IX. How the three knights, with Percivale’s sister, came unto</a>
<a id='line_11448'>the same forest, and of an hart and four lions, and other things.</a>
<a id='line_11449'></a>
<a id='line_11450'></a>
<a id='line_11451'>Then began he to weep right tenderly, and said: Long have I abiden your</a>
<a id='line_11452'>coming, but for God’s love hold me in your arms, that my soul may</a>
<a id='line_11453'>depart out of my body in so good a man’s arms as ye be. Gladly, said</a>
<a id='line_11454'>Galahad. And then one said on high, that all heard: Galahad, well hast</a>
<a id='line_11455'>thou avenged me on God’s enemies. Now behoveth thee to go to the Maimed</a>
<a id='line_11456'>King as soon as thou mayest, for he shall receive by thee health which</a>
<a id='line_11457'>he hath abiden so long. And therewith the soul departed from the body,</a>
<a id='line_11458'>and Galahad made him to be buried as him ought to be.</a>
<a id='line_11459'></a>
<a id='line_11460'>Right so departed the three knights, and Percivale’s sister with them.</a>
<a id='line_11461'>And so they came into a waste forest, and there they saw afore them a</a>
<a id='line_11462'>white hart which four lions led. Then they took them to assent for to</a>
<a id='line_11463'>follow after for to know whither they repaired; and so they rode after</a>
<a id='line_11464'>a great pace till that they came to a valley, and thereby was an</a>
<a id='line_11465'>hermitage where a good man dwelled, and the hart and the lions entered</a>
<a id='line_11466'>also. So when they saw all this they turned to the chapel, and saw the</a>
<a id='line_11467'>good man in a religious weed and in the armour of Our Lord, for he</a>
<a id='line_11468'>would sing mass of the Holy Ghost; and so they entered in and heard</a>
<a id='line_11469'>mass. And at the secrets of the mass they three saw the hart become a</a>
<a id='line_11470'>man, the which marvelled them, and set him upon the altar in a rich</a>
<a id='line_11471'>siege; and saw the four lions were changed, the one to the form of a</a>
<a id='line_11472'>man, the other to the form of a lion, and the third to an eagle, and</a>
<a id='line_11473'>the fourth was changed unto an ox. Then took they their siege where the</a>
<a id='line_11474'>hart sat, and went out through a glass window, and there was nothing</a>
<a id='line_11475'>perished nor broken; and they heard a voice say: In such a manner</a>
<a id='line_11476'>entered the Son of God in the womb of a maid Mary, whose virginity ne</a>
<a id='line_11477'>was perished ne hurt. And when they heard these words they fell down to</a>
<a id='line_11478'>the earth and were astonied; and therewith was a great clearness.</a>
<a id='line_11479'></a>
<a id='line_11480'>And when they were come to theirself again they went to the good man</a>
<a id='line_11481'>and prayed him that he would say them truth. What thing have ye seen?</a>
<a id='line_11482'>said he. And they told him all that they had seen. Ah lords, said he,</a>
<a id='line_11483'>ye be welcome; now wot I well ye be the good knights the which shall</a>
<a id='line_11484'>bring the Sangreal to an end; for ye be they unto whom Our Lord shall</a>
<a id='line_11485'>shew great secrets. And well ought Our Lord be signified to an hart,</a>
<a id='line_11486'>for the hart when he is old he waxeth young again in his white skin.</a>
<a id='line_11487'>Right so cometh again Our Lord from death to life, for He lost earthly</a>
<a id='line_11488'>flesh that was the deadly flesh, which He had taken in the womb of the</a>
<a id='line_11489'>blessed Virgin Mary; and for that cause appeared Our Lord as a white</a>
<a id='line_11490'>hart without spot. And the four that were with Him is to understand the</a>
<a id='line_11491'>four evangelists which set in writing a part of Jesu Christ’s deeds</a>
<a id='line_11492'>that He did sometime when He was among you an earthly man; for wit ye</a>
<a id='line_11493'>well never erst ne might no knight know the truth, for ofttimes or this</a>
<a id='line_11494'>Our Lord showed Him unto good men and unto good knights, in likeness of</a>
<a id='line_11495'>an hart, but I suppose from henceforth ye shall see no more. And then</a>
<a id='line_11496'>they joyed much, and dwelled there all that day. And upon the morrow</a>
<a id='line_11497'>when they had heard mass they departed and commended the good man to</a>
<a id='line_11498'>God: and so they came to a castle and passed by. So there came a knight</a>
<a id='line_11499'>armed after them and said: Lords, hark what I shall say to you.</a>
<a id='line_11500'></a>
<a id='line_11501'></a>
<a id='line_11502'></a>
<a id='line_11503'></a>
<a id='line_11504'>CHAPTER X. How they were desired of a strange custom, the which they</a>
<a id='line_11505'>would not obey; wherefore they fought and slew many knights.</a>
<a id='line_11506'></a>
<a id='line_11507'></a>
<a id='line_11508'>This gentlewoman that ye lead with you is a maid? Sir, said she, a maid</a>
<a id='line_11509'>I am. Then he took her by the bridle and said: By the Holy Cross, ye</a>
<a id='line_11510'>shall not escape me to-fore ye have yolden the custom of this castle.</a>
<a id='line_11511'>Let her go, said Percivale, ye be not wise, for a maid in what place</a>
<a id='line_11512'>she cometh is free. So in the meanwhile there came out a ten or twelve</a>
<a id='line_11513'>knights armed, out of the castle, and with them came gentlewomen which</a>
<a id='line_11514'>held a dish of silver. And then they said: This gentlewoman must yield</a>
<a id='line_11515'>us the custom of this castle. Sir, said a knight, what maid passeth</a>
<a id='line_11516'>hereby shall give this dish full of blood of her right arm. Blame have</a>
<a id='line_11517'>ye, said Galahad, that brought up such customs, and so God me save, I</a>
<a id='line_11518'>ensure you of this gentlewoman ye shall fail while that I live. So God</a>
<a id='line_11519'>me help, said Percivale, I had liefer be slain. And I also, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_11520'>Bors. By my troth, said the knight, then shall ye die, for ye may not</a>
<a id='line_11521'>endure against us though ye were the best knights of the world.</a>
<a id='line_11522'></a>
<a id='line_11523'>Then let they run each to other, and the three fellows beat the ten</a>
<a id='line_11524'>knights, and then set their hands to their swords and beat them down</a>
<a id='line_11525'>and slew them. Then there came out of the castle a three score knights</a>
<a id='line_11526'>armed. Fair lords, said the three fellows, have mercy on yourself and</a>
<a id='line_11527'>have not ado with us. Nay, fair lords, said the knights of the castle,</a>
<a id='line_11528'>we counsel you to withdraw you, for ye be the best knights of the</a>
<a id='line_11529'>world, and therefore do no more, for ye have done enough. We will let</a>
<a id='line_11530'>you go with this harm, but we must needs have the custom. Certes, said</a>
<a id='line_11531'>Galahad, for nought speak ye. Well, said they, will ye die? We be not</a>
<a id='line_11532'>yet come thereto, said Galahad. Then began they to meddle together, and</a>
<a id='line_11533'>Galahad, with the strange girdles, drew his sword, and smote on the</a>
<a id='line_11534'>right hand and on the left hand, and slew what that ever abode him, and</a>
<a id='line_11535'>did such marvels that there was none that saw him but weened he had</a>
<a id='line_11536'>been none earthly man, but a monster. And his two fellows halp him</a>
<a id='line_11537'>passing well, and so they held the journey everych in like hard till it</a>
<a id='line_11538'>was night: then must they needs depart.</a>
<a id='line_11539'></a>
<a id='line_11540'>So came in a good knight, and said to the three fellows: If ye will</a>
<a id='line_11541'>come in to-night and take such harbour as here is ye shall be right</a>
<a id='line_11542'>welcome, and we shall ensure you by the faith of our bodies, and as we</a>
<a id='line_11543'>be true knights, to leave you in such estate to-morrow as we find you,</a>
<a id='line_11544'>without any falsehood. And as soon as ye know of the custom we dare say</a>
<a id='line_11545'>ye will accord therefore. For God’s love, said the gentlewoman, go</a>
<a id='line_11546'>thither and spare not for me. Go we, said Galahad; and so they entered</a>
<a id='line_11547'>into the chapel. And when they were alighted they made great joy of</a>
<a id='line_11548'>them. So within a while the three knights asked the custom of the</a>
<a id='line_11549'>castle and wherefore it was. What it is, said they, we will say you</a>
<a id='line_11550'>sooth.</a>
<a id='line_11551'></a>
<a id='line_11552'></a>
<a id='line_11553'></a>
<a id='line_11554'></a>
<a id='line_11555'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Percivale’s sister bled a dish full of blood for to</a>
<a id='line_11556'>heal a lady, wherefore she died; and how that the body was put in a</a>
<a id='line_11557'>ship.</a>
<a id='line_11558'></a>
<a id='line_11559'></a>
<a id='line_11560'>There is in this castle a gentlewoman which we and this castle is hers,</a>
<a id='line_11561'>and many other. So it befell many years agone there fell upon her a</a>
<a id='line_11562'>malady; and when she had lain a great while she fell unto a measle, and</a>
<a id='line_11563'>of no leech she could have no remedy. But at the last an old man said</a>
<a id='line_11564'>an she might have a dish full of blood of a maid and a clean virgin in</a>
<a id='line_11565'>will and in work, and a king’s daughter, that blood should be her</a>
<a id='line_11566'>health, and for to anoint her withal; and for this thing was this</a>
<a id='line_11567'>custom made. Now, said Percivale’s sister, fair knights, I see well</a>
<a id='line_11568'>that this gentlewoman is but dead. Certes, said Galahad, an ye bleed so</a>
<a id='line_11569'>much ye may die. Truly, said she, an I die for to heal her I shall get</a>
<a id='line_11570'>me great worship and soul’s health, and worship to my lineage, and</a>
<a id='line_11571'>better is one harm than twain. And therefore there shall be no more</a>
<a id='line_11572'>battle, but to-morn I shall yield you your custom of this castle. And</a>
<a id='line_11573'>then there was great joy more than there was to-fore, for else had</a>
<a id='line_11574'>there been mortal war upon the morn; notwithstanding she would none</a>
<a id='line_11575'>other, whether they wold or nold.</a>
<a id='line_11576'></a>
<a id='line_11577'>That night were the three fellows eased with the best; and on the morn</a>
<a id='line_11578'>they heard mass, and Sir Percivale’s sister bade bring forth the sick</a>
<a id='line_11579'>lady. So she was, the which was evil at ease. Then said she: Who shall</a>
<a id='line_11580'>let me blood? So one came forth and let her blood, and she bled so much</a>
<a id='line_11581'>that the dish was full. Then she lift up her hand and blessed her; and</a>
<a id='line_11582'>then she said to the lady: Madam, I am come to the death for to make</a>
<a id='line_11583'>you whole, for God’s love pray for me. With that she fell in a swoon.</a>
<a id='line_11584'>Then Galahad and his two fellows start up to her, and lift her up and</a>
<a id='line_11585'>staunched her, but she had bled so much that she might not live. Then</a>
<a id='line_11586'>she said when she was awaked: Fair brother Percivale, I die for the</a>
<a id='line_11587'>healing of this lady, so I require you that ye bury me not in this</a>
<a id='line_11588'>country, but as soon as I am dead put me in a boat at the next haven,</a>
<a id='line_11589'>and let me go as adventure will lead me; and as soon as ye three come</a>
<a id='line_11590'>to the City of Sarras, there to enchieve the Holy Grail, ye shall find</a>
<a id='line_11591'>me under a tower arrived, and there bury me in the spiritual place; for</a>
<a id='line_11592'>I say you so much, there Galahad shall be buried, and ye also, in the</a>
<a id='line_11593'>same place.</a>
<a id='line_11594'></a>
<a id='line_11595'>Then Percivale understood these words, and granted it her, weeping. And</a>
<a id='line_11596'>then said a voice: Lords and fellows, to-morrow at the hour of prime ye</a>
<a id='line_11597'>three shall depart everych from other, till the adventure bring you to</a>
<a id='line_11598'>the Maimed King. Then asked she her Saviour; and as soon as she had</a>
<a id='line_11599'>received it the soul departed from the body. So the same day was the</a>
<a id='line_11600'>lady healed, when she was anointed withal. Then Sir Percivale made a</a>
<a id='line_11601'>letter of all that she had holpen them as in strange adventures, and</a>
<a id='line_11602'>put it in her right hand, and so laid her in a barge, and covered it</a>
<a id='line_11603'>with black silk; and so the wind arose, and drove the barge from the</a>
<a id='line_11604'>land, and all knights beheld it till it was out of their sight. Then</a>
<a id='line_11605'>they drew all to the castle, and so forthwith there fell a sudden</a>
<a id='line_11606'>tempest and a thunder, lightning, and rain, as all the earth would have</a>
<a id='line_11607'>broken. So half the castle turned up-so-down. So it passed evensong or</a>
<a id='line_11608'>the tempest was ceased.</a>
<a id='line_11609'></a>
<a id='line_11610'>Then they saw afore them a knight armed and wounded hard in the body</a>
<a id='line_11611'>and in the head, that said: O God, succour me for now it is need. After</a>
<a id='line_11612'>this knight came another knight and a dwarf, which cried to them afar:</a>
<a id='line_11613'>Stand, ye may not escape. Then the wounded knight held up his hands to</a>
<a id='line_11614'>God that he should not die in such tribulation. Truly, said Galahad, I</a>
<a id='line_11615'>shall succour him for His sake that he calleth upon. Sir, said Bors, I</a>
<a id='line_11616'>shall do it, for it is not for you, for he is but one knight. Sir, said</a>
<a id='line_11617'>he, I grant. So Sir Bors took his horse, and commended him to God, and</a>
<a id='line_11618'>rode after, to rescue the wounded knight. Now turn we to the two</a>
<a id='line_11619'>fellows.</a>

<a id='line_11625'>maidens that had bled to death.</a>
<a id='line_11626'></a>
<a id='line_11627'></a>
<a id='line_11628'>Now saith the story that all night Galahad and Percivale were in a</a>
<a id='line_11629'>chapel in their prayers, for to save Sir Bors. So on the morrow they</a>
<a id='line_11630'>dressed them in their harness toward the castle, to wit what was fallen</a>
<a id='line_11631'>of them therein. And when they came there they found neither man nor</a>
<a id='line_11632'>woman that he ne was dead by the vengeance of Our Lord. With that they</a>
<a id='line_11633'>heard a voice that said: This vengeance is for blood-shedding of</a>
<a id='line_11634'>maidens. Also they found at the end of the chapel a churchyard, and</a>
<a id='line_11635'>therein might they see a three score fair tombs, and that place was so</a>
<a id='line_11636'>fair and so delectable that it seemed them there had been none tempest,</a>
<a id='line_11637'>for there lay the bodies of all the good maidens which were martyred</a>
<a id='line_11638'>for the sick lady’s sake. Also they found the names of everych, and of</a>
<a id='line_11639'>what blood they were come, and all were of kings’ blood, and twelve of</a>
<a id='line_11640'>them were kings’ daughters. Then they departed and went into a forest.</a>
<a id='line_11641'>Now, said Percivale unto Galahad, we must depart, so pray we Our Lord</a>
<a id='line_11642'>that we may meet together in short time: then they did off their helms</a>
<a id='line_11643'>and kissed together, and wept at their departing.</a>

<a id='line_11647'></a>
<a id='line_11648'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Launcelot entered into the ship where Sir</a>
<a id='line_11649'>Percivale’s sister lay dead, and how he met with Sir Galahad, his son.</a>
<a id='line_11650'></a>
<a id='line_11651'></a>
<a id='line_11652'>Now saith the history, that when Launcelot was come to the water of</a>
<a id='line_11653'>Mortoise, as it is rehearsed before, he was in great peril, and so he</a>
<a id='line_11654'>laid him down and slept, and took the adventure that God would send</a>
<a id='line_11655'>him. So when he was asleep there came a vision unto him and said:</a>
<a id='line_11656'>Launcelot, arise up and take thine armour, and enter into the first</a>
<a id='line_11657'>ship that thou shalt find. And when he heard these words he start up</a>
<a id='line_11658'>and saw great clearness about him. And then he lift up his hand and</a>
<a id='line_11659'>blessed him, and so took his arms and made him ready; and so by</a>
<a id='line_11660'>adventure he came by a strand, and found a ship the which was without</a>
<a id='line_11661'>sail or oar. And as soon as he was within the ship there he felt the</a>
<a id='line_11662'>most sweetness that ever he felt, and he was fulfilled with all thing</a>
<a id='line_11663'>that he thought on or desired. Then he said: Fair sweet Father, Jesu</a>
<a id='line_11664'>Christ, I wot not in what joy I am, for this joy passeth all earthly</a>
<a id='line_11665'>joys that ever I was in. And so in this joy he laid him down to the</a>
<a id='line_11666'>ship’s board, and slept till day. And when he awoke he found there a</a>
<a id='line_11667'>fair bed, and therein lying a gentlewoman dead, the which was Sir</a>
<a id='line_11668'>Percivale’s sister. And as Launcelot devised her, he espied in her</a>
<a id='line_11669'>right hand a writ, the which he read, the which told him all the</a>
<a id='line_11670'>adventures that ye have heard to-fore, and of what lineage she was</a>
<a id='line_11671'>come. So with this gentlewoman Sir Launcelot was a month and more. If</a>
<a id='line_11672'>ye would ask how he lived, He that fed the people of Israel with manna</a>
<a id='line_11673'>in the desert, so was he fed; for every day when he had said his</a>
<a id='line_11674'>prayers he was sustained with the grace of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_11675'></a>
<a id='line_11676'>So on a night he went to play him by the water side, for he was</a>
<a id='line_11677'>somewhat weary of the ship. And then he listened and heard an horse</a>
<a id='line_11678'>come, and one riding upon him. And when he came nigh he seemed a</a>
<a id='line_11679'>knight. And so he let him pass, and went thereas the ship was; and</a>
<a id='line_11680'>there he alighted, and took the saddle and the bridle and put the horse</a>
<a id='line_11681'>from him, and went into the ship. And then Launcelot dressed unto him,</a>
<a id='line_11682'>and said: Ye be welcome. And he answered and saluted him again, and</a>
<a id='line_11683'>asked him: What is your name? for much my heart giveth unto you. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_11684'>said he, my name is Launcelot du Lake. Sir, said he, then be ye</a>
<a id='line_11685'>welcome, for ye were the beginner of me in this world. Ah, said he, are</a>
<a id='line_11686'>ye Galahad? Yea, forsooth, said he; and so he kneeled down and asked</a>
<a id='line_11687'>him his blessing, and after took off his helm and kissed him. And there</a>
<a id='line_11688'>was great joy between them, for there is no tongue can tell the joy</a>
<a id='line_11689'>that they made either of other, and many a friendly word spoken</a>
<a id='line_11690'>between, as kin would, the which is no need here to be rehearsed. And</a>
<a id='line_11691'>there everych told other of their adventures and marvels that were</a>
<a id='line_11692'>befallen to them in many journeys sith that they departed from the</a>
<a id='line_11693'>court.</a>
<a id='line_11694'></a>
<a id='line_11695'>Anon, as Galahad saw the gentlewoman dead in the bed, he knew her well</a>
<a id='line_11696'>enough, and told great worship of her, that she was the best maid</a>
<a id='line_11697'>living, and it was great pity of her death. But when Launcelot heard</a>
<a id='line_11698'>how the marvellous sword was gotten, and who made it, and all the</a>
<a id='line_11699'>marvels rehearsed afore, then he prayed Galahad, his son, that he would</a>
<a id='line_11700'>show him the sword, and so he did; and anon he kissed the pommel, and</a>
<a id='line_11701'>the hilt, and the scabbard. Truly, said Launcelot, never erst knew I of</a>
<a id='line_11702'>so high adventures done, and so marvellous and strange. So dwelt</a>
<a id='line_11703'>Launcelot and Galahad within that ship half a year, and served God</a>
<a id='line_11704'>daily and nightly with all their power; and often they arrived in isles</a>
<a id='line_11705'>far from folk, where there repaired none but wild beasts, and there</a>
<a id='line_11706'>they found many strange adventures and perilous, which they brought to</a>
<a id='line_11707'>an end; but for those adventures were with wild beasts, and not in the</a>
<a id='line_11708'>quest of the Sangreal, therefore the tale maketh here no mention</a>
<a id='line_11709'>thereof, for it would be too long to tell of all those adventures that</a>
<a id='line_11710'>befell them.</a>

<a id='line_11715'>CHAPTER XIV. How a knight brought unto Sir Galahad a horse, and bade</a>
<a id='line_11716'>him come from his father, Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_11717'></a>
<a id='line_11718'></a>
<a id='line_11719'>So after, on a Monday, it befell that they arrived in the edge of a</a>
<a id='line_11720'>forest to-fore a cross; and then saw they a knight armed all in white,</a>
<a id='line_11721'>and was richly horsed, and led in his right hand a white horse; and so</a>
<a id='line_11722'>he came to the ship, and saluted the two knights on the High Lord’s</a>
<a id='line_11723'>behalf, and said: Galahad, sir, ye have been long enough with your</a>
<a id='line_11724'>father, come out of the ship, and start upon this horse, and go where</a>
<a id='line_11725'>the adventures shall lead thee in the quest of the Sangreal. Then he</a>
<a id='line_11726'>went to his father and kissed him sweetly, and said: Fair sweet father,</a>
<a id='line_11727'>I wot not when I shall see you more till I see the body of Jesu Christ.</a>
<a id='line_11728'>I pray you, said Launcelot, pray ye to the High Father that He hold me</a>
<a id='line_11729'>in His service. And so he took his horse, and there they heard a voice</a>
<a id='line_11730'>that said: Think for to do well, for the one shall never see the other</a>
<a id='line_11731'>before the dreadful day of doom. Now, son Galahad, said Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_11732'>since we shall depart, and never see other, I pray to the High Father</a>
<a id='line_11733'>to conserve me and you both. Sir, said Galahad, no prayer availeth so</a>
<a id='line_11734'>much as yours. And therewith Galahad entered into the forest.</a>
<a id='line_11735'></a>
<a id='line_11736'>And the wind arose, and drove Launcelot more than a month throughout</a>
<a id='line_11737'>the sea, where he slept but little, but prayed to God that he might see</a>
<a id='line_11738'>some tidings of the Sangreal. So it befell on a night, at midnight, he</a>
<a id='line_11739'>arrived afore a castle, on the back side, which was rich and fair, and</a>
<a id='line_11740'>there was a postern opened toward the sea, and was open without any</a>
<a id='line_11741'>keeping, save two lions kept the entry; and the moon shone clear. Anon</a>
<a id='line_11742'>Sir Launcelot heard a voice that said: Launcelot, go out of this ship</a>
<a id='line_11743'>and enter into the castle, where thou shalt see a great part of thy</a>
<a id='line_11744'>desire. Then he ran to his arms, and so armed him, and so went to the</a>
<a id='line_11745'>gate and saw the lions. Then set he hand to his sword and drew it. Then</a>
<a id='line_11746'>there came a dwarf suddenly, and smote him on the arm so sore that the</a>
<a id='line_11747'>sword fell out of his hand. Then heard he a voice say: O man of evil</a>
<a id='line_11748'>faith and poor belief, wherefore trowest thou more on thy harness than</a>
<a id='line_11749'>in thy Maker, for He might more avail thee than thine armour, in whose</a>
<a id='line_11750'>service that thou art set. Then said Launcelot: Fair Father Jesu</a>
<a id='line_11751'>Christ, I thank thee of Thy great mercy that Thou reprovest me of my</a>
<a id='line_11752'>misdeed; now see I well that ye hold me for your servant. Then took he</a>
<a id='line_11753'>again his sword and put it up in his sheath, and made a cross in his</a>
<a id='line_11754'>forehead, and came to the lions, and they made semblaunt to do him</a>
<a id='line_11755'>harm. Notwithstanding he passed by them without hurt, and entered into</a>
<a id='line_11756'>the castle to the chief fortress, and there were they all at rest. Then</a>
<a id='line_11757'>Launcelot entered in so armed, for he found no gate nor door but it was</a>
<a id='line_11758'>open. And at the last he found a chamber whereof the door was shut, and</a>
<a id='line_11759'>he set his hand thereto to have opened it, but he might not.</a>
<a id='line_11760'></a>

<a id='line_11764'>CHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot was to-fore the door of the chamber</a>
<a id='line_11765'>wherein the Holy Sangreal was.</a>
<a id='line_11766'></a>
<a id='line_11767'></a>
<a id='line_11768'>Then he enforced him mickle to undo the door. Then he listened and</a>
<a id='line_11769'>heard a voice which sang so sweetly that it seemed none earthly thing;</a>
<a id='line_11770'>and him thought the voice said: Joy and honour be to the Father of</a>
<a id='line_11771'>Heaven. Then Launcelot kneeled down to-fore the chamber, for well wist</a>
<a id='line_11772'>he that there was the Sangreal within that chamber. Then said he: Fair</a>
<a id='line_11773'>sweet Father, Jesu Christ, if ever I did thing that pleased Thee, Lord</a>
<a id='line_11774'>for Thy pity never have me not in despite for my sins done aforetime,</a>
<a id='line_11775'>and that Thou show me something of that I seek. And with that he saw</a>
<a id='line_11776'>the chamber door open, and there came out a great clearness, that the</a>
<a id='line_11777'>house was as bright as all the torches of the world had been there.</a>
<a id='line_11778'></a>
<a id='line_11779'>So came he to the chamber door, and would have entered. And anon a</a>
<a id='line_11780'>voice said to him: Flee, Launcelot, and enter not, for thou oughtest</a>
<a id='line_11781'>not to do it; and if thou enter thou shalt for-think it. Then he</a>
<a id='line_11782'>withdrew him aback right heavy. Then looked he up in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_11783'>chamber, and saw a table of silver, and the Holy Vessel, covered with</a>
<a id='line_11784'>red samite, and many angels about it, whereof one held a candle of wax</a>
<a id='line_11785'>burning, and the other held a cross, and the ornaments of an altar. And</a>
<a id='line_11786'>before the Holy Vessel he saw a good man clothed as a priest. And it</a>
<a id='line_11787'>seemed that he was at the sacring of the mass. And it seemed to</a>
<a id='line_11788'>Launcelot that above the priest’s hands were three men, whereof the two</a>
<a id='line_11789'>put the youngest by likeness between the priest’s hands; and so he lift</a>
<a id='line_11790'>it up right high, and it seemed to show so to the people. And then</a>
<a id='line_11791'>Launcelot marvelled not a little, for him thought the priest was so</a>
<a id='line_11792'>greatly charged of the figure that him seemed that he should fall to</a>
<a id='line_11793'>the earth. And when he saw none about him that would help him, then</a>
<a id='line_11794'>came he to the door a great pace, and said: Fair Father Jesu Christ, ne</a>
<a id='line_11795'>take it for no sin though I help the good man which hath great need of</a>
<a id='line_11796'>help.</a>
<a id='line_11797'></a>
<a id='line_11798'>Right so entered he into the chamber, and came toward the table of</a>
<a id='line_11799'>silver; and when he came nigh he felt a breath, that him thought it was</a>
<a id='line_11800'>intermeddled with fire, which smote him so sore in the visage that him</a>
<a id='line_11801'>thought it brent his visage; and therewith he fell to the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_11802'>had no power to arise, as he that was so araged, that had lost the</a>
<a id='line_11803'>power of his body, and his hearing, and his seeing. Then felt he many</a>
<a id='line_11804'>hands about him, which took him up and bare him out of the chamber</a>
<a id='line_11805'>door, without any amending of his swoon, and left him there, seeming</a>
<a id='line_11806'>dead to all people.</a>
<a id='line_11807'></a>
<a id='line_11808'>So upon the morrow when it was fair day they within were arisen, and</a>
<a id='line_11809'>found Launcelot lying afore the chamber door. All they marvelled how</a>
<a id='line_11810'>that he came in, and so they looked upon him, and felt his pulse to wit</a>
<a id='line_11811'>whether there were any life in him; and so they found life in him, but</a>
<a id='line_11812'>he might not stand nor stir no member that he had. And so they took him</a>
<a id='line_11813'>by every part of the body, and bare him into a chamber, and laid him in</a>
<a id='line_11814'>a rich bed, far from all folk; and so he lay four days. Then the one</a>
<a id='line_11815'>said he was alive, and the other said, Nay. In the name of God, said an</a>
<a id='line_11816'>old man, for I do you verily to wit he is not dead, but he is so full</a>
<a id='line_11817'>of life as the mightiest of you all; and therefore I counsel you that</a>
<a id='line_11818'>he be well kept till God send him life again.</a>

<a id='line_11825'></a>
<a id='line_11826'></a>
<a id='line_11827'>In such manner they kept Launcelot four-and-twenty days and all so many</a>
<a id='line_11828'>nights, that ever he lay still as a dead man; and at the twenty-fifth</a>
<a id='line_11829'>day befell him after midday that he opened his eyes. And when he saw</a>
<a id='line_11830'>folk he made great sorrow, and said: Why have ye awaked me, for I was</a>
<a id='line_11831'>more at ease than I am now. O Jesu Christ, who might be so blessed that</a>
<a id='line_11832'>might see openly thy great marvels of secretness there where no sinner</a>
<a id='line_11833'>may be! What have ye seen? said they about him. I have seen, said he,</a>
<a id='line_11834'>so great marvels that no tongue may tell, and more than any heart can</a>
<a id='line_11835'>think, and had not my son been here afore me I had seen much more.</a>
<a id='line_11836'></a>
<a id='line_11837'>Then they told him how he had lain there four-and-twenty days and</a>
<a id='line_11838'>nights. Then him thought it was punishment for the four-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_11839'>years that he had been a sinner, wherefore Our Lord put him in penance</a>
<a id='line_11840'>four-and-twenty days and nights. Then looked Sir Launcelot afore him,</a>
<a id='line_11841'>and saw the hair which he had borne nigh a year, for that he</a>
<a id='line_11842'>for-thought him right much that he had broken his promise unto the</a>
<a id='line_11843'>hermit, which he had avowed to do. Then they asked how it stood with</a>
<a id='line_11844'>him. Forsooth, said he, I am whole of body, thanked be Our Lord;</a>
<a id='line_11845'>therefore, sirs, for God’s love tell me where I am. Then said they all</a>
<a id='line_11846'>that he was in the castle of Carbonek.</a>
<a id='line_11847'></a>
<a id='line_11848'>Therewith came a gentlewoman and brought him a shirt of small linen</a>
<a id='line_11849'>cloth, but he changed not there, but took the hair to him again. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_11850'>said they, the quest of the Sangreal is achieved now right in you, that</a>
<a id='line_11851'>never shall ye see of the Sangreal no more than ye have seen. Now I</a>
<a id='line_11852'>thank God, said Launcelot, of His great mercy of that I have seen, for</a>
<a id='line_11853'>it sufficeth me; for as I suppose no man in this world hath lived</a>
<a id='line_11854'>better than I have done to enchieve that I have done. And therewith he</a>
<a id='line_11855'>took the hair and clothed him in it, and above that he put a linen</a>
<a id='line_11856'>shirt, and after a robe of scarlet, fresh and new. And when he was so</a>
<a id='line_11857'>arrayed they marvelled all, for they knew him that he was Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_11858'>the good knight. And then they said all: O my lord Sir Launcelot, be</a>
<a id='line_11859'>that ye? And he said: Truly I am he.</a>
<a id='line_11860'></a>
<a id='line_11861'>Then came word to King Pelles that the knight that had lain so long</a>
<a id='line_11862'>dead was Sir Launcelot. Then was the king right glad, and went to see</a>
<a id='line_11863'>him. And when Launcelot saw him come he dressed him against him, and</a>
<a id='line_11864'>there made the king great joy of him. And there the king told him</a>
<a id='line_11865'>tidings that his fair daughter was dead. Then Launcelot was right heavy</a>
<a id='line_11866'>of it, and said: Sir, me forthinketh the death of your daughter, for</a>
<a id='line_11867'>she was a full fair lady, fresh and young. And well I wot she bare the</a>
<a id='line_11868'>best knight that is now on the earth, or that ever was sith God was</a>
<a id='line_11869'>born. So the king held him there four days, and on the morrow he took</a>
<a id='line_11870'>his leave at King Pelles and at all the fellowship, and thanked them of</a>
<a id='line_11871'>their great labour.</a>
<a id='line_11872'></a>
<a id='line_11873'>Right so as they sat at their dinner in the chief salle, then was so</a>
<a id='line_11874'>befallen that the Sangreal had fulfilled the table with all manner of</a>
<a id='line_11875'>meats that any heart might think. So as they sat they saw all the doors</a>
<a id='line_11876'>and the windows of the place were shut without man’s hand, whereof they</a>
<a id='line_11877'>were all abashed, and none wist what to do.</a>
<a id='line_11878'></a>
<a id='line_11879'>And then it happed suddenly a knight came to the chief door and</a>
<a id='line_11880'>knocked, and cried: Undo the door. But they would not. And ever he</a>
<a id='line_11881'>cried: Undo; but they would not. And at last it noyed them so much that</a>
<a id='line_11882'>the king himself arose and came to a window there where the knight</a>
<a id='line_11883'>called. Then he said: Sir knight, ye shall not enter at this time while</a>
<a id='line_11884'>the Sangreal is here, and therefore go into another; for certes ye be</a>
<a id='line_11885'>none of the knights of the quest, but one of them which hath served the</a>
<a id='line_11886'>fiend, and hast left the service of Our Lord: and he was passing wroth</a>
<a id='line_11887'>at the king’s words. Sir knight, said the king, sith ye would so fain</a>
<a id='line_11888'>enter, say me of what country ye be. Sir, said he, I am of the realm of</a>
<a id='line_11889'>Logris, and my name is Ector de Maris, and brother unto my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_11890'>Launcelot. In the name of God, said the king, me for-thinketh of what I</a>
<a id='line_11891'>have said, for your brother is here within. And when Ector de Maris</a>
<a id='line_11892'>understood that his brother was there, for he was the man in the world</a>
<a id='line_11893'>that he most dread and loved, and then he said: Ah God, now doubleth my</a>
<a id='line_11894'>sorrow and shame. Full truly said the good man of the hill unto Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_11895'>and to me of our dreams. Then went he out of the court as fast as his</a>
<a id='line_11896'>horse might, and so throughout the castle.</a>

<a id='line_11902'>adventures which he saw in the way.</a>
<a id='line_11903'></a>
<a id='line_11904'></a>
<a id='line_11905'>Then King Pelles came to Sir Launcelot and told him tidings of his</a>
<a id='line_11906'>brother, whereof he was sorry, that he wist not what to do. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_11907'>Launcelot departed, and took his arms, and said he would go see the</a>
<a id='line_11908'>realm of Logris, which I have not seen in twelve months. And therewith</a>
<a id='line_11909'>he commended the king to God, and so rode through many realms. And at</a>
<a id='line_11910'>the last he came to a white abbey, and there they made him that night</a>
<a id='line_11911'>great cheer; and on the morn he rose and heard mass. And afore an altar</a>
<a id='line_11912'>he found a rich tomb, which was newly made; and then he took heed, and</a>
<a id='line_11913'>saw the sides written with gold which said: Here lieth King Bagdemagus</a>
<a id='line_11914'>of Gore, which King Arthur’s nephew slew; and named him, Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_11915'>Then was not he a little sorry, for Launcelot loved him much more than</a>
<a id='line_11916'>any other, and had it been any other than Gawaine he should not have</a>
<a id='line_11917'>escaped from death to life; and said to himself: Ah Lord God, this is a</a>
<a id='line_11918'>great hurt unto King Arthur’s court, the loss of such a man. And then</a>
<a id='line_11919'>he departed and came to the abbey where Galahad did the adventure of</a>
<a id='line_11920'>the tombs, and won the white shield with the red cross; and there had</a>
<a id='line_11921'>he great cheer all that night.</a>
<a id='line_11922'></a>
<a id='line_11923'>And on the morn he turned unto Camelot, where he found King Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_11924'>the queen. But many of the knights of the Round Table were slain and</a>
<a id='line_11925'>destroyed, more than half. And so three were come home, Ector, Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_11926'>and Lionel, and many other that need not to be rehearsed. And all the</a>
<a id='line_11927'>court was passing glad of Sir Launcelot, and the king asked him many</a>
<a id='line_11928'>tidings of his son Galahad. And there Launcelot told the king of his</a>
<a id='line_11929'>adventures that had befallen him since he departed. And also he told</a>
<a id='line_11930'>him of the adventures of Galahad, Percivale, and Bors, which that he</a>
<a id='line_11931'>knew by the letter of the dead damosel, and as Galahad had told him.</a>
<a id='line_11932'>Now God would, said the king, that they were all three here. That shall</a>
<a id='line_11933'>never be, said Launcelot, for two of them shall ye never see, but one</a>
<a id='line_11934'>of them shall come again.</a>
<a id='line_11935'></a>
<a id='line_11936'>Now leave we this story and speak of Galahad.</a>
<a id='line_11937'></a>

<a id='line_11939'></a>
<a id='line_11940'></a>
<a id='line_11941'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Galahad came to King Mordrains, and of other matters</a>
<a id='line_11942'>and adventures.</a>
<a id='line_11943'></a>
<a id='line_11944'></a>
<a id='line_11945'>Now, saith the story, Galahad rode many journeys in vain. And at the</a>
<a id='line_11946'>last he came to the abbey where King Mordrains was, and when he heard</a>
<a id='line_11947'>that, he thought he would abide to see him. And upon the morn, when he</a>
<a id='line_11948'>had heard mass, Galahad came unto King Mordrains, and anon the king saw</a>
<a id='line_11949'>him, which had lain blind of long time. And then he dressed him against</a>
<a id='line_11950'>him, and said: Galahad, the servant of Jesu Christ, whose coming I have</a>
<a id='line_11951'>abiden so long, now embrace me and let me rest on thy breast, so that I</a>
<a id='line_11952'>may rest between thine arms, for thou art a clean virgin above all</a>
<a id='line_11953'>knights, as the flower of the lily in whom virginity is signified, and</a>
<a id='line_11954'>thou art the rose the which is the flower of all good virtues, and in</a>
<a id='line_11955'>colour of fire. For the fire of the Holy Ghost is taken so in thee that</a>
<a id='line_11956'>my flesh which was all dead of oldness is become young again. Then</a>
<a id='line_11957'>Galahad heard his words, then he embraced him and all his body. Then</a>
<a id='line_11958'>said he: Fair Lord Jesu Christ, now I have my will. Now I require thee,</a>
<a id='line_11959'>in this point that I am in, thou come and visit me. And anon Our Lord</a>
<a id='line_11960'>heard his prayer: therewith the soul departed from the body.</a>
<a id='line_11961'></a>
<a id='line_11962'>And then Galahad put him in the earth as a king ought to be, and so</a>
<a id='line_11963'>departed and so came into a perilous forest where he found the well the</a>
<a id='line_11964'>which boileth with great waves, as the tale telleth to-fore. And as</a>
<a id='line_11965'>soon as Galahad set his hand thereto it ceased, so that it brent no</a>
<a id='line_11966'>more, and the heat departed. For that it brent it was a sign of</a>
<a id='line_11967'>lechery, the which was that time much used. But that heat might not</a>
<a id='line_11968'>abide his pure virginity. And this was taken in the country for a</a>
<a id='line_11969'>miracle. And so ever after was it called Galahad’s well.</a>
<a id='line_11970'></a>
<a id='line_11971'>Then by adventure he came into the country of Gore, and into the abbey</a>
<a id='line_11972'>where Launcelot had been to-forehand, and found the tomb of King</a>
<a id='line_11973'>Bagdemagus, but he was founder thereof, Joseph of Aramathie’s son; and</a>
<a id='line_11974'>the tomb of Simeon where Launcelot had failed. Then he looked into a</a>
<a id='line_11975'>croft under the minster, and there he saw a tomb which brent full</a>
<a id='line_11976'>marvellously. Then asked he the brethren what it was. Sir, said they, a</a>
<a id='line_11977'>marvellous adventure that may not be brought unto none end but by him</a>
<a id='line_11978'>that passeth of bounty and of knighthood all them of the Round Table. I</a>
<a id='line_11979'>would, said Galahad, that ye would lead me thereto. Gladly, said they,</a>
<a id='line_11980'>and so led him till a cave. And he went down upon greses, and came nigh</a>
<a id='line_11981'>the tomb. And then the flaming failed, and the fire staunched, the</a>
<a id='line_11982'>which many a day had been great. Then came there a voice that said:</a>
<a id='line_11983'>Much are ye beholden to thank Our Lord, the which hath given you a good</a>
<a id='line_11984'>hour, that ye may draw out the souls of earthly pain, and to put them</a>
<a id='line_11985'>into the joys of paradise. I am of your kindred, the which hath dwelled</a>
<a id='line_11986'>in this heat this three hundred winter and four-and-fifty to be purged</a>
<a id='line_11987'>of the sin that I did against Joseph of Aramathie. Then Galahad took</a>
<a id='line_11988'>the body in his arms and bare it into the minster. And that night lay</a>
<a id='line_11989'>Galahad in the abbey; and on the morn he gave him service, and put him</a>
<a id='line_11990'>in the earth afore the high altar.</a>
<a id='line_11991'></a>

<a id='line_11997'></a>
<a id='line_11998'></a>
<a id='line_11999'>So departed he from thence, and commended the brethren to God; and so</a>
<a id='line_12000'>he rode five days till that he came to the Maimed King. And ever</a>
<a id='line_12001'>followed Percivale the five days, asking where he had been; and so one</a>
<a id='line_12002'>told him how the adventures of Logris were enchieved. So on a day it</a>
<a id='line_12003'>befell that they came out of a great forest, and there they met at</a>
<a id='line_12004'>traverse with Sir Bors, the which rode alone. It is none need to tell</a>
<a id='line_12005'>if they were glad; and them he saluted, and they yielded him honour and</a>
<a id='line_12006'>good adventure, and everych told other. Then said Bors: It is mo than a</a>
<a id='line_12007'>year and an half that I ne lay ten times where men dwelled, but in wild</a>
<a id='line_12008'>forests and in mountains, but God was ever my comfort.</a>
<a id='line_12009'></a>
<a id='line_12010'>Then rode they a great while till that they came to the castle of</a>
<a id='line_12011'>Carbonek. And when they were entered within the castle King Pelles knew</a>
<a id='line_12012'>them; then there was great joy, for they wist well by their coming that</a>
<a id='line_12013'>they had fulfilled the quest of the Sangreal. Then Eliazar, King</a>
<a id='line_12014'>Pelles’ son, brought to-fore them the broken sword wherewith Joseph was</a>
<a id='line_12015'>stricken through the thigh. Then Bors set his hand thereto, if that he</a>
<a id='line_12016'>might have soldered it again; but it would not be. Then he took it to</a>
<a id='line_12017'>Percivale, but he had no more power thereto than he. Now have ye it</a>
<a id='line_12018'>again, said Percivale to Galahad, for an it be ever enchieved by any</a>
<a id='line_12019'>bodily man ye must do it. And then he took the pieces and set them</a>
<a id='line_12020'>together, and they seemed that they had never been broken, and as well</a>
<a id='line_12021'>as it had been first forged. And when they within espied that the</a>
<a id='line_12022'>adventure of the sword was enchieved, then they gave the sword to Bors,</a>
<a id='line_12023'>for it might not be better set; for he was a good knight and a worthy</a>
<a id='line_12024'>man.</a>
<a id='line_12025'></a>
<a id='line_12026'>And a little afore even the sword arose great and marvellous, and was</a>
<a id='line_12027'>full of great heat that many men fell for dread. And anon alighted a</a>
<a id='line_12028'>voice among them, and said: They that ought not to sit at the table of</a>
<a id='line_12029'>Jesu Christ arise, for now shall very knights be fed. So they went</a>
<a id='line_12030'>thence, all save King Pelles and Eliazar, his son, the which were holy</a>
<a id='line_12031'>men, and a maid which was his niece; and so these three fellows and</a>
<a id='line_12032'>they three were there, no mo. Anon they saw knights all armed came in</a>
<a id='line_12033'>at the hall door, and did off their helms and their arms, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_12034'>Galahad: Sir, we have hied right much for to be with you at this table</a>
<a id='line_12035'>where the holy meat shall be departed. Then said he: Ye be welcome, but</a>
<a id='line_12036'>of whence be ye? So three of them said they were of Gaul, and other</a>
<a id='line_12037'>three said they were of Ireland, and the other three said they were of</a>
<a id='line_12038'>Denmark. So as they sat thus there came out a bed of tree, of a</a>
<a id='line_12039'>chamber, the which four gentlewomen brought; and in the bed lay a good</a>
<a id='line_12040'>man sick, and a crown of gold upon his head; and there in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_12041'>the place they set him down, and went again their way. Then he lift up</a>
<a id='line_12042'>his head, and said: Galahad, Knight, ye be welcome, for much have I</a>
<a id='line_12043'>desired your coming, for in such pain and in such anguish I have been</a>
<a id='line_12044'>long. But now I trust to God the term is come that my pain shall be</a>
<a id='line_12045'>allayed, that I shall pass out of this world so as it was promised me</a>
<a id='line_12046'>long ago. Therewith a voice said: There be two among you that be not in</a>
<a id='line_12047'>the quest of the Sangreal, and therefore depart ye.</a>

<a id='line_12053'>and how Our Lord appeared to them, and other things.</a>
<a id='line_12054'></a>
<a id='line_12055'></a>
<a id='line_12056'>Then King Pelles and his son departed. And therewithal beseemed them</a>
<a id='line_12057'>that there came a man, and four angels from heaven, clothed in likeness</a>
<a id='line_12058'>of a bishop, and had a cross in his hand; and these four angels bare</a>
<a id='line_12059'>him up in a chair, and set him down before the table of silver where</a>
<a id='line_12060'>upon the Sangreal was; and it seemed that he had in midst of his</a>
<a id='line_12061'>forehead letters the which said: See ye here Joseph, the first bishop</a>
<a id='line_12062'>of Christendom, the same which Our Lord succoured in the city of Sarras</a>
<a id='line_12063'>in the spiritual place. Then the knights marvelled, for that bishop was</a>
<a id='line_12064'>dead more than three hundred year to-fore. O knights, said he, marvel</a>
<a id='line_12065'>not, for I was sometime an earthly man. With that they heard the</a>
<a id='line_12066'>chamber door open, and there they saw angels; and two bare candles of</a>
<a id='line_12067'>wax, and the third a towel, and the fourth a spear which bled</a>
<a id='line_12068'>marvellously, that three drops fell within a box which he held with his</a>
<a id='line_12069'>other hand. And they set the candles upon the table, and the third the</a>
<a id='line_12070'>towel upon the vessel, and the fourth the holy spear even upright upon</a>
<a id='line_12071'>the vessel. And then the bishop made semblaunt as though he would have</a>
<a id='line_12072'>gone to the sacring of the mass. And then he took an ubblie which was</a>
<a id='line_12073'>made in likeness of bread. And at the lifting up there came a figure in</a>
<a id='line_12074'>likeness of a child, and the visage was as red and as bright as any</a>
<a id='line_12075'>fire, and smote himself into the bread, so that they all saw it that</a>
<a id='line_12076'>the bread was formed of a fleshly man; and then he put it into the Holy</a>
<a id='line_12077'>Vessel again, and then he did that longed to a priest to do to a mass.</a>
<a id='line_12078'>And then he went to Galahad and kissed him, and bade him go and kiss</a>
<a id='line_12079'>his fellows: and so he did anon. Now, said he, servants of Jesu Christ,</a>
<a id='line_12080'>ye shall be fed afore this table with sweet meats that never knights</a>
<a id='line_12081'>tasted. And when he had said, he vanished away. And they set them at</a>
<a id='line_12082'>the table in great dread, and made their prayers.</a>
<a id='line_12083'></a>
<a id='line_12084'>Then looked they and saw a man come out of the Holy Vessel, that had</a>
<a id='line_12085'>all the signs of the passion of Jesu Christ, bleeding all openly, and</a>
<a id='line_12086'>said: My knights, and my servants, and my true children, which be come</a>
<a id='line_12087'>out of deadly life into spiritual life, I will now no longer hide me</a>
<a id='line_12088'>from you, but ye shall see now a part of my secrets and of my hidden</a>
<a id='line_12089'>things: now hold and receive the high meat which ye have so much</a>
<a id='line_12090'>desired. Then took he himself the Holy Vessel and came to Galahad; and</a>
<a id='line_12091'>he kneeled down, and there he received his Saviour, and after him so</a>
<a id='line_12092'>received all his fellows; and they thought it so sweet that it was</a>
<a id='line_12093'>marvellous to tell. Then said he to Galahad: Son, wottest thou what I</a>
<a id='line_12094'>hold betwixt my hands? Nay, said he, but if ye will tell me. This is,</a>
<a id='line_12095'>said he, the holy dish wherein I ate the lamb on Sheer-Thursday. And</a>
<a id='line_12096'>now hast thou seen that thou most desired to see, but yet hast thou not</a>
<a id='line_12097'>seen it so openly as thou shalt see it in the city of Sarras in the</a>
<a id='line_12098'>spiritual place. Therefore thou must go hence and bear with thee this</a>
<a id='line_12099'>Holy Vessel; for this night it shall depart from the realm of Logris,</a>
<a id='line_12100'>that it shall never be seen more here. And wottest thou wherefore? For</a>
<a id='line_12101'>he is not served nor worshipped to his right by them of this land, for</a>
<a id='line_12102'>they be turned to evil living; therefore I shall disherit them of the</a>
<a id='line_12103'>honour which I have done them. And therefore go ye three to-morrow unto</a>
<a id='line_12104'>the sea, where ye shall find your ship ready, and with you take the</a>
<a id='line_12105'>sword with the strange girdles, and no more with you but Sir Percivale</a>
<a id='line_12106'>and Sir Bors. Also I will that ye take with you of the blood of this</a>
<a id='line_12107'>spear for to anoint the Maimed King, both his legs and all his body,</a>
<a id='line_12108'>and he shall have his health. Sir, said Galahad, why shall not these</a>
<a id='line_12109'>other fellows go with us? For this cause: for right as I departed my</a>
<a id='line_12110'>apostles one here and another there, so I will that ye depart; and two</a>
<a id='line_12111'>of you shall die in my service, but one of you shall come again and</a>
<a id='line_12112'>tell tidings. Then gave he them his blessing and vanished away.</a>

<a id='line_12117'>CHAPTER XXI. How Galahad anointed with the blood of the spear the</a>
<a id='line_12118'>Maimed King, and of other adventures.</a>
<a id='line_12119'></a>
<a id='line_12120'></a>
<a id='line_12121'>And Galahad went anon to the spear which lay upon the table, and</a>
<a id='line_12122'>touched the blood with his fingers, and came after to the Maimed King</a>
<a id='line_12123'>and anointed his legs.</a>
<a id='line_12124'></a>
<a id='line_12125'>And therewith he clothed him anon, and start upon his feet out of his</a>
<a id='line_12126'>bed as an whole man, and thanked Our Lord that He had healed him. And</a>
<a id='line_12127'>that was not to the worldward, for anon he yielded him to a place of</a>
<a id='line_12128'>religion of white monks, and was a full holy man.</a>
<a id='line_12129'></a>
<a id='line_12130'>That same night about midnight came a voice among them which said: My</a>
<a id='line_12131'>sons and not my chief sons, my friends and not my warriors, go ye hence</a>
<a id='line_12132'>where ye hope best to do and as I bade you.</a>
<a id='line_12133'></a>
<a id='line_12134'>Ah, thanked be Thou, Lord, that Thou wilt vouchsafe to call us, Thy</a>
<a id='line_12135'>sinners. Now may we well prove that we have not lost our pains.</a>
<a id='line_12136'></a>
<a id='line_12137'>And anon in all haste they took their harness and departed.</a>
<a id='line_12138'></a>
<a id='line_12139'>But the three knights of Gaul, one of them hight Claudine, King</a>
<a id='line_12140'>Claudas’ son, and the other two were great gentlemen. Then prayed</a>
<a id='line_12141'>Galahad to everych of them, that if they come to King Arthur’s court</a>
<a id='line_12142'>that they should salute my lord, Sir Launcelot, my father, and all them</a>
<a id='line_12143'>of the Round Table; and prayed them if that they came on that part that</a>
<a id='line_12144'>they should not forget it.</a>
<a id='line_12145'></a>
<a id='line_12146'>Right so departed Galahad, Percivale and Bors with him; and so they</a>
<a id='line_12147'>rode three days, and then they came to a rivage, and found the ship</a>
<a id='line_12148'>whereof the tale speaketh of to-fore. And when they came to the board</a>
<a id='line_12149'>they found in the midst the table of silver which they had left with</a>
<a id='line_12150'>the Maimed King, and the Sangreal which was covered with red samite.</a>
<a id='line_12151'></a>
<a id='line_12152'>Then were they glad to have such things in their fellowship; and so</a>
<a id='line_12153'>they entered and made great reverence thereto; and Galahad fell in his</a>
<a id='line_12154'>prayer long time to Our Lord, that at what time he asked, that he</a>
<a id='line_12155'>should pass out of this world.</a>
<a id='line_12156'></a>
<a id='line_12157'>So much he prayed till a voice said to him: Galahad, thou shalt have</a>
<a id='line_12158'>thy request; and when thou askest the death of thy body thou shalt have</a>
<a id='line_12159'>it, and then shalt thou find the life of the soul.</a>
<a id='line_12160'></a>
<a id='line_12161'>Percivale heard this, and prayed him, of fellowship that was between</a>
<a id='line_12162'>them, to tell him wherefore he asked such things.</a>
<a id='line_12163'></a>
<a id='line_12164'>That shall I tell you, said Galahad; the other day when we saw a part</a>
<a id='line_12165'>of the adventures of the Sangreal I was in such a joy of heart, that I</a>
<a id='line_12166'>trow never man was that was earthly. And therefore I wot well, when my</a>
<a id='line_12167'>body is dead my soul shall be in great joy to see the blessed Trinity</a>
<a id='line_12168'>every day, and the majesty of Our Lord, Jesu Christ.</a>
<a id='line_12169'></a>
<a id='line_12170'>So long were they in the ship that they said to Galahad: Sir, in this</a>
<a id='line_12171'>bed ought ye to lie, for so saith the scripture. And so he laid him</a>
<a id='line_12172'>down and slept a great while; and when he awaked he looked afore him</a>
<a id='line_12173'>and saw the city of Sarras. And as they would have landed they saw the</a>
<a id='line_12174'>ship wherein Percivale had put his sister in. Truly, said Percivale, in</a>
<a id='line_12175'>the name of God, well hath my sister holden us covenant. Then took they</a>
<a id='line_12176'>out of the ship the table of silver, and he took it to Percivale and to</a>
<a id='line_12177'>Bors, to go to-fore, and Galahad came behind. And right so they went to</a>
<a id='line_12178'>the city, and at the gate of the city they saw an old man crooked. Then</a>
<a id='line_12179'>Galahad called him and bade him help to bear this heavy thing. Truly,</a>
<a id='line_12180'>said the old man, it is ten year ago that I might not go but with</a>
<a id='line_12181'>crutches. Care thou not, said Galahad, and arise up and shew thy good</a>
<a id='line_12182'>will. And so he assayed, and found himself as whole as ever he was.</a>
<a id='line_12183'>Than ran he to the table, and took one part against Galahad. And anon</a>
<a id='line_12184'>arose there great noise in the city, that a cripple was made whole by</a>
<a id='line_12185'>knights marvellous that entered into the city.</a>
<a id='line_12186'></a>
<a id='line_12187'>Then anon after, the three knights went to the water, and brought up</a>
<a id='line_12188'>into the palace Percivale’s sister, and buried her as richly as a</a>
<a id='line_12189'>king’s daughter ought to be. And when the king of the city, which was</a>
<a id='line_12190'>cleped Estorause, saw the fellowship, he asked them of whence they</a>
<a id='line_12191'>were, and what thing it was that they had brought upon the table of</a>
<a id='line_12192'>silver. And they told him the truth of the Sangreal, and the power</a>
<a id='line_12193'>which that God had sent there. Then the king was a tyrant, and was come</a>
<a id='line_12194'>of the line of paynims, and took them and put them in prison in a deep</a>
<a id='line_12195'>hole.</a>
<a id='line_12196'></a>
<a id='line_12197'></a>
<a id='line_12198'></a>
<a id='line_12199'></a>
<a id='line_12200'>CHAPTER XXII. How they were fed with the Sangreal while they were in</a>
<a id='line_12201'>prison, and how Galahad was made king.</a>
<a id='line_12202'></a>
<a id='line_12203'></a>
<a id='line_12204'>But as soon as they were there Our Lord sent them the Sangreal, through</a>
<a id='line_12205'>whose grace they were always fulfilled while that they were in prison.</a>
<a id='line_12206'></a>
<a id='line_12207'>So at the year’s end it befell that this King Estorause lay sick, and</a>
<a id='line_12208'>felt that he should die. Then he sent for the three knights, and they</a>
<a id='line_12209'>came afore him; and he cried them mercy of that he had done to them,</a>
<a id='line_12210'>and they forgave it him goodly; and he died anon. When the king was</a>
<a id='line_12211'>dead all the city was dismayed, and wist not who might be their king.</a>
<a id='line_12212'>Right so as they were in counsel there came a voice among them, and</a>
<a id='line_12213'>bade them choose the youngest knight of them three to be their king:</a>
<a id='line_12214'>For he shall well maintain you and all yours. So they made Galahad king</a>
<a id='line_12215'>by all the assent of the holy city, and else they would have slain him.</a>
<a id='line_12216'>And when he was come to behold the land, he let make above the table of</a>
<a id='line_12217'>silver a chest of gold and of precious stones, that hilled the Holy</a>
<a id='line_12218'>Vessel. And every day early the three fellows would come afore it, and</a>
<a id='line_12219'>make their prayers.</a>
<a id='line_12220'></a>
<a id='line_12221'>Now at the year’s end, and the self day after Galahad had borne the</a>
<a id='line_12222'>crown of gold, he arose up early and his fellows, and came to the</a>
<a id='line_12223'>palace, and saw to-fore them the Holy Vessel, and a man kneeling on his</a>
<a id='line_12224'>knees in likeness of a bishop, that had about him a great fellowship of</a>
<a id='line_12225'>angels, as it had been Jesu Christ himself; and then he arose and began</a>
<a id='line_12226'>a mass of Our Lady. And when he came to the sacrament of the mass, and</a>
<a id='line_12227'>had done, anon he called Galahad, and said to him: Come forth the</a>
<a id='line_12228'>servant of Jesu Christ, and thou shalt see that thou hast much desired</a>
<a id='line_12229'>to see. And then he began to tremble right hard when the deadly flesh</a>
<a id='line_12230'>began to behold the spiritual things. Then he held up his hands toward</a>
<a id='line_12231'>heaven and said: Lord, I thank thee, for now I see that that hath been</a>
<a id='line_12232'>my desire many a day. Now, blessed Lord, would I not longer live, if it</a>
<a id='line_12233'>might please thee, Lord. And therewith the good man took Our Lord’s</a>
<a id='line_12234'>body betwixt his hands, and proffered it to Galahad, and he received it</a>
<a id='line_12235'>right gladly and meekly. Now wottest thou what I am? said the good man.</a>
<a id='line_12236'>Nay, said Galahad. I am Joseph of Aramathie, the which Our Lord hath</a>
<a id='line_12237'>sent here to thee to bear thee fellowship; and wottest thou wherefore</a>
<a id='line_12238'>that he hath sent me more than any other? For thou hast resembled me in</a>
<a id='line_12239'>two things; in that thou hast seen the marvels of the Sangreal, in that</a>
<a id='line_12240'>thou hast been a clean maiden, as I have been and am.</a>
<a id='line_12241'></a>
<a id='line_12242'>And when he had said these words Galahad went to Percivale and kissed</a>
<a id='line_12243'>him, and commended him to God; and so he went to Sir Bors and kissed</a>
<a id='line_12244'>him, and commended him to God, and said: Fair lord, salute me to my</a>
<a id='line_12245'>lord, Sir Launcelot, my father, and as soon as ye see him, bid him</a>
<a id='line_12246'>remember of this unstable world. And therewith he kneeled down to-fore</a>
<a id='line_12247'>the table and made his prayers, and then suddenly his soul departed to</a>
<a id='line_12248'>Jesu Christ, and a great multitude of angels bare his soul up to</a>
<a id='line_12249'>heaven, that the two fellows might well behold it. Also the two fellows</a>
<a id='line_12250'>saw come from heaven an hand, but they saw not the body. And then it</a>
<a id='line_12251'>came right to the Vessel, and took it and the spear, and so bare it up</a>
<a id='line_12252'>to heaven. Sithen was there never man so hardy to say that he had seen</a>
<a id='line_12253'>the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_12254'></a>
<a id='line_12255'></a>
<a id='line_12256'></a>
<a id='line_12257'></a>
<a id='line_12258'>CHAPTER XXIII. Of the sorrow that Percivale and Bors made when Galahad</a>
<a id='line_12259'>was dead: and of Percivale how he died, and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_12260'></a>
<a id='line_12261'></a>
<a id='line_12262'>When Percivale and Bors saw Galahad dead they made as much sorrow as</a>
<a id='line_12263'>ever did two men. And if they had not been good men they might lightly</a>
<a id='line_12264'>have fallen in despair. And the people of the country and of the city</a>
<a id='line_12265'>were right heavy. And then he was buried; and as soon as he was buried</a>
<a id='line_12266'>Sir Percivale yielded him to an hermitage out of the city, and took a</a>
<a id='line_12267'>religious clothing. And Bors was alway with him, but never changed he</a>
<a id='line_12268'>his secular clothing, for that he purposed him to go again into the</a>
<a id='line_12269'>realm of Logris. Thus a year and two months lived Sir Percivale in the</a>
<a id='line_12270'>hermitage a full holy life, and then passed out of this world; and Bors</a>
<a id='line_12271'>let bury him by his sister and by Galahad in the spiritualities.</a>
<a id='line_12272'></a>
<a id='line_12273'>When Bors saw that he was in so far countries as in the parts of</a>
<a id='line_12274'>Babylon he departed from Sarras, and armed him and came to the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_12275'>entered into a ship; and so it befell him in good adventure he came</a>
<a id='line_12276'>into the realm of Logris; and he rode so fast till he came to Camelot</a>
<a id='line_12277'>where the king was. And then was there great joy made of him in the</a>
<a id='line_12278'>court, for they weened all he had been dead, forasmuch as he had been</a>
<a id='line_12279'>so long out of the country. And when they had eaten, the king made</a>
<a id='line_12280'>great clerks to come afore him, that they should chronicle of the high</a>
<a id='line_12281'>adventures of the good knights. When Bors had told him of the</a>
<a id='line_12282'>adventures of the Sangreal, such as had befallen him and his three</a>
<a id='line_12283'>fellows, that was Launcelot, Percivale, Galahad, and himself, there</a>
<a id='line_12284'>Launcelot told the adventures of the Sangreal that he had seen. All</a>
<a id='line_12285'>this was made in great books, and put up in almeries at Salisbury. And</a>
<a id='line_12286'>anon Sir Bors said to Sir Launcelot: Galahad, your own son, saluted you</a>
<a id='line_12287'>by me, and after you King Arthur and all the court, and so did Sir</a>
<a id='line_12288'>Percivale, for I buried them with mine own hands in the city of Sarras.</a>
<a id='line_12289'>Also, Sir Launcelot, Galahad prayed you to remember of this unsiker</a>
<a id='line_12290'>world as ye behight him when ye were together more than half a year.</a>
<a id='line_12291'>This is true, said Launcelot; now I trust to God his prayer shall avail</a>
<a id='line_12292'>me.</a>
<a id='line_12293'></a>
<a id='line_12294'>Then Launcelot took Sir Bors in his arms, and said: Gentle cousin, ye</a>
<a id='line_12295'>are right welcome to me, and all that ever I may do for you and for</a>
<a id='line_12296'>yours ye shall find my poor body ready at all times, while the spirit</a>
<a id='line_12297'>is in it, and that I promise you faithfully, and never to fail. And wit</a>
<a id='line_12298'>ye well, gentle cousin, Sir Bors, that ye and I will never depart</a>
<a id='line_12299'>asunder whilst our lives may last. Sir, said he, I will as ye will.</a>
<a id='line_12300'></a>
<a id='line_12301'>_Thus endeth the history of the Sangreal, that was briefly drawn out of</a>
<a id='line_12302'>French into English, the which is a story chronicled for one of the</a>

<a id='line_12316'>CHAPTER I. Of the joy King Arthur and the queen had of the achievement</a>
<a id='line_12317'>of the Sangreal; and how Launcelot fell to his old love again.</a>
<a id='line_12318'></a>
<a id='line_12319'></a>
<a id='line_12320'>So after the quest of the Sangreal was fulfilled, and all knights that</a>
<a id='line_12321'>were left alive were come again unto the Table Round, as the book of</a>
<a id='line_12322'>the Sangreal maketh mention, then was there great joy in the court; and</a>
<a id='line_12323'>in especial King Arthur and Queen Guenever made great joy of the</a>
<a id='line_12324'>remnant that were come home, and passing glad was the king and the</a>
<a id='line_12325'>queen of Sir Launcelot and of Sir Bors, for they had been passing long</a>
<a id='line_12326'>away in the quest of the Sangreal.</a>
<a id='line_12327'></a>
<a id='line_12328'>Then, as the book saith, Sir Launcelot began to resort unto Queen</a>
<a id='line_12329'>Guenever again, and forgat the promise and the perfection that he made</a>
<a id='line_12330'>in the quest. For, as the book saith, had not Sir Launcelot been in his</a>
<a id='line_12331'>privy thoughts and in his mind so set inwardly to the queen as he was</a>
<a id='line_12332'>in seeming outward to God, there had no knight passed him in the quest</a>
<a id='line_12333'>of the Sangreal; but ever his thoughts were privily on the queen, and</a>
<a id='line_12334'>so they loved together more hotter than they did to-forehand, and had</a>
<a id='line_12335'>such privy draughts together, that many in the court spake of it, and</a>
<a id='line_12336'>in especial Sir Agravaine, Sir Gawaine’s brother, for he was ever</a>
<a id='line_12337'>open-mouthed.</a>
<a id='line_12338'></a>
<a id='line_12339'>So befell that Sir Launcelot had many resorts of ladies and damosels</a>
<a id='line_12340'>that daily resorted unto him, that besought him to be their champion,</a>
<a id='line_12341'>and in all such matters of right Sir Launcelot applied him daily to do</a>
<a id='line_12342'>for the pleasure of Our Lord, Jesu Christ. And ever as much as he might</a>
<a id='line_12343'>he withdrew him from the company and fellowship of Queen Guenever, for</a>
<a id='line_12344'>to eschew the slander and noise; wherefore the queen waxed wroth with</a>
<a id='line_12345'>Sir Launcelot. And upon a day she called Sir Launcelot unto her</a>
<a id='line_12346'>chamber, and said thus: Sir Launcelot, I see and feel daily that thy</a>
<a id='line_12347'>love beginneth to slake, for thou hast no joy to be in my presence, but</a>
<a id='line_12348'>ever thou art out of this court, and quarrels and matters thou hast</a>
<a id='line_12349'>nowadays for ladies and gentlewomen more than ever thou wert wont to</a>
<a id='line_12350'>have aforehand.</a>
<a id='line_12351'></a>
<a id='line_12352'>Ah madam, said Launcelot, in this ye must hold me excused for divers</a>
<a id='line_12353'>causes; one is, I was but late in the quest of the Sangreal; and I</a>
<a id='line_12354'>thank God of his great mercy, and never of my desert, that I saw in</a>
<a id='line_12355'>that my quest as much as ever saw any sinful man, and so was it told</a>
<a id='line_12356'>me. And if I had not had my privy thoughts to return to your love again</a>
<a id='line_12357'>as I do, I had seen as great mysteries as ever saw my son Galahad,</a>
<a id='line_12358'>outher Percivale, or Sir Bors; and therefore, madam, I was but late in</a>
<a id='line_12359'>that quest. Wit ye well, madam, it may not be yet lightly forgotten the</a>
<a id='line_12360'>high service in whom I did my diligent labour. Also, madam, wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_12361'>that there be many men speak of our love in this court, and have you</a>
<a id='line_12362'>and me greatly in await, as Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred; and madam,</a>
<a id='line_12363'>wit ye well I dread them more for your sake than for any fear I have of</a>
<a id='line_12364'>them myself, for I may happen to escape and rid myself in a great need,</a>
<a id='line_12365'>where ye must abide all that will be said unto you. And then if that ye</a>
<a id='line_12366'>fall in any distress through wilful folly, then is there none other</a>
<a id='line_12367'>remedy or help but by me and my blood. And wit ye well, madam, the</a>
<a id='line_12368'>boldness of you and me will bring us to great shame and slander; and</a>
<a id='line_12369'>that were me loath to see you dishonoured. And that is the cause I take</a>
<a id='line_12370'>upon me more for to do for damosels and maidens than ever I did</a>
<a id='line_12371'>to-fore, that men should understand my joy and my delight is my</a>
<a id='line_12372'>pleasure to have ado for damosels and maidens.</a>

<a id='line_12378'>and of the sorrow that Launcelot made.</a>
<a id='line_12379'></a>
<a id='line_12380'></a>
<a id='line_12381'>All this while the queen stood still and let Sir Launcelot say what he</a>
<a id='line_12382'>would. And when he had all said she brast out a-weeping, and so she</a>
<a id='line_12383'>sobbed and wept a great while. And when she might speak she said:</a>
<a id='line_12384'>Launcelot, now I well understand that thou art a false recreant knight</a>
<a id='line_12385'>and a common lecher, and lovest and holdest other ladies, and by me</a>
<a id='line_12386'>thou hast disdain and scorn. For wit thou well, she said, now I</a>
<a id='line_12387'>understand thy falsehood, and therefore shall I never love thee no</a>
<a id='line_12388'>more. And never be thou so hardy to come in my sight; and right here I</a>
<a id='line_12389'>discharge thee this court, that thou never come within it; and I</a>
<a id='line_12390'>forfend thee my fellowship, and upon pain of thy head that thou see me</a>
<a id='line_12391'>no more. Right so Sir Launcelot departed with great heaviness, that</a>
<a id='line_12392'>unnethe he might sustain himself for great dole-making.</a>
<a id='line_12393'></a>
<a id='line_12394'>Then he called Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel, and told</a>
<a id='line_12395'>them how the queen had forfended him the court, and so he was in will</a>
<a id='line_12396'>to depart into his own country. Fair sir, said Sir Bors de Ganis, ye</a>
<a id='line_12397'>shall not depart out of this land by mine advice. Ye must remember in</a>
<a id='line_12398'>what honour ye are renowned, and called the noblest knight of the</a>
<a id='line_12399'>world; and many great matters ye have in hand. And women in their</a>
<a id='line_12400'>hastiness will do ofttimes that sore repenteth them; and therefore by</a>
<a id='line_12401'>mine advice ye shall take your horse, and ride to the good hermitage</a>
<a id='line_12402'>here beside Windsor, that sometime was a good knight, his name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_12403'>Brasias, and there shall ye abide till I send you word of better</a>
<a id='line_12404'>tidings. Brother, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well I am full loath to</a>
<a id='line_12405'>depart out of this realm, but the queen hath defended me so highly,</a>
<a id='line_12406'>that meseemeth she will never be my good lady as she hath been. Say ye</a>
<a id='line_12407'>never so, said Sir Bors, for many times or this time she hath been</a>
<a id='line_12408'>wroth with you, and after it she was the first that repented it. Ye say</a>
<a id='line_12409'>well, said Launcelot, for now will I do by your counsel, and take mine</a>
<a id='line_12410'>horse and my harness, and ride to the hermit Sir Brasias, and there</a>
<a id='line_12411'>will I repose me until I hear some manner of tidings from you; but,</a>
<a id='line_12412'>fair brother, I pray you get me the love of my lady, Queen Guenever, an</a>
<a id='line_12413'>ye may. Sir, said Sir Bors, ye need not to move me of such matters, for</a>
<a id='line_12414'>well ye wot I will do what I may to please you.</a>
<a id='line_12415'></a>
<a id='line_12416'>And then the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, departed with right heavy</a>
<a id='line_12417'>cheer suddenly, that none earthly creature wist of him, nor where he</a>
<a id='line_12418'>was become, but Sir Bors. So when Sir Launcelot was departed, the queen</a>
<a id='line_12419'>outward made no manner of sorrow in showing to none of his blood nor to</a>
<a id='line_12420'>none other. But wit ye well, inwardly, as the book saith, she took</a>
<a id='line_12421'>great thought, but she bare it out with a proud countenance as though</a>
<a id='line_12422'>she felt nothing nor danger.</a>
<a id='line_12423'></a>
<a id='line_12424'></a>
<a id='line_12425'></a>
<a id='line_12426'></a>
<a id='line_12427'>CHAPTER III. How at a dinner that the queen made there was a knight</a>
<a id='line_12428'>enpoisoned, which Sir Mador laid on the queen.</a>
<a id='line_12429'></a>
<a id='line_12430'></a>
<a id='line_12431'>And then the queen let make a privy dinner in London unto the knights</a>
<a id='line_12432'>of the Round Table. And all was for to show outward that she had as</a>
<a id='line_12433'>great joy in all other knights of the Table Round as she had in Sir</a>
<a id='line_12434'>Launcelot. All only at that dinner she had Sir Gawaine and his</a>
<a id='line_12435'>brethren, that is for to say Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_12436'>and Sir Mordred. Also there was Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Blamore de</a>
<a id='line_12437'>Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_12438'>Maris, Sir Lionel, Sir Palomides, Safere his brother, Sir La Cote Male</a>
<a id='line_12439'>Taile, Sir Persant, Sir Ironside, Sir Brandiles, Sir Kay le Seneschal,</a>
<a id='line_12440'>Sir Mador de la Porte, Sir Patrise, a knight of Ireland, Aliduk, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12441'>Astamore, and Sir Pinel le Savage, the which was cousin to Sir Lamorak</a>
<a id='line_12442'>de Galis, the good knight that Sir Gawaine and his brethren slew by</a>
<a id='line_12443'>treason. And so these four-and-twenty knights should dine with the</a>
<a id='line_12444'>queen in a privy place by themself, and there was made a great feast of</a>
<a id='line_12445'>all manner of dainties.</a>
<a id='line_12446'></a>
<a id='line_12447'>But Sir Gawaine had a custom that he used daily at dinner and at</a>
<a id='line_12448'>supper, that he loved well all manner of fruit, and in especial apples</a>
<a id='line_12449'>and pears. And therefore whosomever dined or feasted Sir Gawaine would</a>
<a id='line_12450'>commonly purvey for good fruit for him, and so did the queen for to</a>
<a id='line_12451'>please Sir Gawaine; she let purvey for him all manner of fruit, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_12452'>Gawaine was a passing hot knight of nature. And this Pinel hated Sir</a>
<a id='line_12453'>Gawaine because of his kinsman Sir Lamorak de Galis; and therefore for</a>
<a id='line_12454'>pure envy and hate Sir Pinel enpoisoned certain apples for to enpoison</a>
<a id='line_12455'>Sir Gawaine. And so this was well unto the end of the meat; and so it</a>
<a id='line_12456'>befell by misfortune a good knight named Patrise, cousin unto Sir Mador</a>
<a id='line_12457'>de la Porte, to take a poisoned apple. And when he had eaten it he</a>
<a id='line_12458'>swelled so till he brast, and there Sir Patrise fell down suddenly dead</a>
<a id='line_12459'>among them.</a>
<a id='line_12460'></a>
<a id='line_12461'>Then every knight leapt from the board ashamed, and araged for wrath,</a>
<a id='line_12462'>nigh out of their wits. For they wist not what to say; considering</a>
<a id='line_12463'>Queen Guenever made the feast and dinner, they all had suspicion unto</a>
<a id='line_12464'>her. My lady, the queen, said Gawaine, wit ye well, madam, that this</a>
<a id='line_12465'>dinner was made for me, for all folks that know my condition understand</a>
<a id='line_12466'>that I love well fruit, and now I see well I had near been slain;</a>
<a id='line_12467'>therefore, madam, I dread me lest ye will be shamed. Then the queen</a>
<a id='line_12468'>stood still and was sore abashed, that she nist not what to say. This</a>
<a id='line_12469'>shall not so be ended, said Sir Mador de la Porte, for here have I lost</a>
<a id='line_12470'>a full noble knight of my blood; and therefore upon this shame and</a>
<a id='line_12471'>despite I will be revenged to the utterance. And there openly Sir Mador</a>
<a id='line_12472'>appealed the queen of the death of his cousin, Sir Patrise. Then stood</a>
<a id='line_12473'>they all still, that none would speak a word against him, for they all</a>
<a id='line_12474'>had great suspicion unto the queen because she let make that dinner.</a>
<a id='line_12475'>And the queen was so abashed that she could none other ways do, but</a>
<a id='line_12476'>wept so heartily that she fell in a swoon. With this noise and cry came</a>
<a id='line_12477'>to them King Arthur, and when he wist of that trouble he was a passing</a>
<a id='line_12478'>heavy man.</a>
<a id='line_12479'></a>
<a id='line_12480'></a>
<a id='line_12481'></a>
<a id='line_12482'></a>
<a id='line_12483'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Mador appeached the queen of treason, and there was</a>
<a id='line_12484'>no knight would fight for her at the first time.</a>
<a id='line_12485'></a>
<a id='line_12486'></a>
<a id='line_12487'>And ever Sir Mador stood still afore the king, and ever he appealed the</a>
<a id='line_12488'>queen of treason; for the custom was such that time that all manner of</a>
<a id='line_12489'>shameful death was called treason. Fair lords, said King Arthur, me</a>
<a id='line_12490'>repenteth of this trouble, but the case is so I may not have ado in</a>
<a id='line_12491'>this matter, for I must be a rightful judge; and that repenteth me that</a>
<a id='line_12492'>I may not do battle for my wife, for as I deem this deed came never by</a>
<a id='line_12493'>her. And therefore I suppose she shall not be all distained, but that</a>
<a id='line_12494'>some good knight shall put his body in jeopardy for my queen rather</a>
<a id='line_12495'>than she shall be brent in a wrong quarrel. And therefore, Sir Mador,</a>
<a id='line_12496'>be not so hasty, for it may happen she shall not be all friendless; and</a>
<a id='line_12497'>therefore desire thou thy day of battle, and she shall purvey her of</a>
<a id='line_12498'>some good knight that shall answer you, or else it were to me great</a>
<a id='line_12499'>shame, and to all my court.</a>
<a id='line_12500'></a>
<a id='line_12501'>My gracious lord, said Sir Mador, ye must hold me excused, for though</a>
<a id='line_12502'>ye be our king in that degree, ye are but a knight as we are, and ye</a>
<a id='line_12503'>are sworn unto knighthood as well as we; and therefore I beseech you</a>
<a id='line_12504'>that ye be not displeased, for there is none of the four-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_12505'>knights that were bidden to this dinner but all they have great</a>
<a id='line_12506'>suspicion unto the queen. What say ye all, my lords? said Sir Mador.</a>
<a id='line_12507'>Then they answered by and by that they could not excuse the queen; for</a>
<a id='line_12508'>why she made the dinner, and either it must come by her or by her</a>
<a id='line_12509'>servants. Alas, said the queen, I made this dinner for a good intent,</a>
<a id='line_12510'>and never for none evil, so Almighty God me help in my right, as I was</a>
<a id='line_12511'>never purposed to do such evil deeds, and that I report me unto God.</a>
<a id='line_12512'></a>
<a id='line_12513'>My lord, the king, said Sir Mador, I require you as ye be a righteous</a>
<a id='line_12514'>king give me a day that I may have justice. Well, said the king, I give</a>
<a id='line_12515'>the day this day fifteen days that thou be ready armed on horseback in</a>
<a id='line_12516'>the meadow beside Westminster. And if it so fall that there be any</a>
<a id='line_12517'>knight to encounter with you, there mayst thou do the best, and God</a>
<a id='line_12518'>speed the right. And if it so fall that there be no knight at that day,</a>
<a id='line_12519'>then must my queen be burnt, and there she shall be ready to have her</a>
<a id='line_12520'>judgment. I am answered, said Sir Mador. And every knight went where it</a>
<a id='line_12521'>liked them.</a>
<a id='line_12522'></a>
<a id='line_12523'>So when the king and the queen were together the king asked the queen</a>
<a id='line_12524'>how this case befell. The queen answered: So God me help, I wot not how</a>
<a id='line_12525'>or in what manner. Where is Sir Launcelot? said King Arthur; an he were</a>
<a id='line_12526'>here he would not grudge to do battle for you. Sir, said the queen, I</a>
<a id='line_12527'>wot not where he is, but his brother and his kinsmen deem that he be</a>
<a id='line_12528'>not within this realm. That me repenteth, said King Arthur, for an he</a>
<a id='line_12529'>were here he would soon stint this strife. Then I will counsel you,</a>
<a id='line_12530'>said the king, and unto Sir Bors: That ye will do battle for her for</a>
<a id='line_12531'>Sir Launcelot’s sake, and upon my life he will not refuse you. For well</a>
<a id='line_12532'>I see, said the king, that none of these four-and-twenty knights that</a>
<a id='line_12533'>were with you at your dinner where Sir Patrise was slain, that will do</a>
<a id='line_12534'>battle for you, nor none of them will say well of you, and that shall</a>
<a id='line_12535'>be a great slander for you in this court. Alas, said the queen, and I</a>
<a id='line_12536'>may not do withal, but now I miss Sir Launcelot, for an he were here he</a>
<a id='line_12537'>would put me soon to my heart’s ease. What aileth you, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_12538'>ye cannot keep Sir Launcelot upon your side? For wit ye well, said the</a>
<a id='line_12539'>king, who that hath Sir Launcelot upon his part hath the most man of</a>
<a id='line_12540'>worship in the world upon his side. Now go your way, said the king unto</a>
<a id='line_12541'>the queen, and require Sir Bors to do battle for you for Sir</a>
<a id='line_12542'>Launcelot’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_12543'></a>
<a id='line_12544'></a>
<a id='line_12545'></a>
<a id='line_12546'></a>
<a id='line_12547'>CHAPTER V. How the queen required Sir Bors to fight for her, and how he</a>
<a id='line_12548'>granted upon condition; and how he warned Sir Launcelot thereof.</a>
<a id='line_12549'></a>
<a id='line_12550'></a>
<a id='line_12551'>So the queen departed from the king, and sent for Sir Bors into her</a>
<a id='line_12552'>chamber. And when he was come she besought him of succour. Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_12553'>he, what would ye that I did? for I may not with my worship have ado in</a>
<a id='line_12554'>this matter, because I was at the same dinner, for dread that any of</a>
<a id='line_12555'>those knights would have me in suspicion. Also, madam, said Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_12556'>now miss ye Sir Launcelot, for he would not have failed you neither in</a>
<a id='line_12557'>right nor in wrong, as ye have well proved when ye have been in danger;</a>
<a id='line_12558'>and now ye have driven him out of this country, by whom ye and all we</a>
<a id='line_12559'>were daily worshipped by; therefore, madam, I marvel how ye dare for</a>
<a id='line_12560'>shame require me to do any thing for you, in so much ye have chased him</a>
<a id='line_12561'>out of your country by whom we were borne up and honoured. Alas, fair</a>
<a id='line_12562'>knight, said the queen, I put me wholly in your grace, and all that is</a>
<a id='line_12563'>done amiss I will amend as ye will counsel me. And therewith she</a>
<a id='line_12564'>kneeled down upon both her knees, and besought Sir Bors to have mercy</a>
<a id='line_12565'>upon her: Outher I shall have a shameful death, and thereto I never</a>
<a id='line_12566'>offended.</a>
<a id='line_12567'></a>
<a id='line_12568'>Right so came King Arthur, and found the queen kneeling afore Sir Bors;</a>
<a id='line_12569'>then Sir Bors pulled her up, and said: Madam, ye do me great dishonour.</a>
<a id='line_12570'>Ah, gentle knight, said the king, have mercy upon my queen, courteous</a>
<a id='line_12571'>knight, for I am now in certain she is untruly defamed. And therefore,</a>
<a id='line_12572'>courteous knight, said the king, promise her to do battle for her, I</a>
<a id='line_12573'>require you for the love of Sir Launcelot. My lord, said Sir Bors, ye</a>
<a id='line_12574'>require me the greatest thing that any man may require me; and wit ye</a>
<a id='line_12575'>well if I grant to do battle for the queen I shall wrath many of my</a>
<a id='line_12576'>fellowship of the Table Round. But as for that, said Bors, I will grant</a>
<a id='line_12577'>my lord that for my lord Sir Launcelot’s sake, and for your sake I will</a>
<a id='line_12578'>at that day be the queen’s champion unless that there come by adventure</a>
<a id='line_12579'>a better knight than I am to do battle for her. Will ye promise me</a>
<a id='line_12580'>this, said the king, by your faith? Yea sir, said Sir Bors, of that I</a>
<a id='line_12581'>will not fail you, nor her both, but if there come a better knight than</a>
<a id='line_12582'>I am, and then shall he have the battle. Then was the king and the</a>
<a id='line_12583'>queen passing glad, and so departed, and thanked him heartily.</a>
<a id='line_12584'></a>
<a id='line_12585'>So then Sir Bors departed secretly upon a day, and rode unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12586'>Launcelot thereas he was with the hermit, Sir Brasias, and told him of</a>
<a id='line_12587'>all their adventure. Ah Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, this is come happily</a>
<a id='line_12588'>as I would have it, and therefore I pray you make you ready to do</a>
<a id='line_12589'>battle, but look that ye tarry till ye see me come, as long as ye may.</a>
<a id='line_12590'>For I am sure Mador is an hot knight when he is enchafed, for the more</a>
<a id='line_12591'>ye suffer him the hastier will he be to battle. Sir, said Bors, let me</a>
<a id='line_12592'>deal with him, doubt ye not ye shall have all your will. Then departed</a>
<a id='line_12593'>Sir Bors from him and came to the court again. Then was it noised in</a>
<a id='line_12594'>all the court that Sir Bors should do battle for the queen; wherefore</a>
<a id='line_12595'>many knights were displeased with him, that he would take upon him to</a>
<a id='line_12596'>do battle in the queen’s quarrel; for there were but few knights in all</a>
<a id='line_12597'>the court but they deemed the queen was in the wrong, and that she had</a>
<a id='line_12598'>done that treason.</a>
<a id='line_12599'></a>
<a id='line_12600'>So Sir Bors answered thus to his fellows of the Table Round: Wit ye</a>
<a id='line_12601'>well, my fair lords, it were shame to us all an we suffered to see the</a>
<a id='line_12602'>most noble queen of the world to be shamed openly, considering her lord</a>
<a id='line_12603'>and our lord is the man of most worship in the world, and most</a>
<a id='line_12604'>christened, and he hath ever worshipped us all in all places. Many</a>
<a id='line_12605'>answered him again: As for our most noble King Arthur, we love him and</a>
<a id='line_12606'>honour him as well as ye do, but as for Queen Guenever we love her not,</a>
<a id='line_12607'>because she is a destroyer of good knights. Fair lords, said Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_12608'>meseemeth ye say not as ye should say, for never yet in my days knew I</a>
<a id='line_12609'>never nor heard say that ever she was a destroyer of any good knight.</a>
<a id='line_12610'>But at all times as far as ever I could know she was a maintainer of</a>
<a id='line_12611'>good knights; and ever she hath been large and free of her goods to all</a>
<a id='line_12612'>good knights, and the most bounteous lady of her gifts and her good</a>
<a id='line_12613'>grace, that ever I saw or heard speak of. And therefore it were shame,</a>
<a id='line_12614'>said Sir Bors, to us all to our most noble king’s wife, an we suffered</a>
<a id='line_12615'>her to be shamefully slain. And wit ye well, said Sir Bors, I will not</a>
<a id='line_12616'>suffer it, for I dare say so much, the queen is not guilty of Sir</a>
<a id='line_12617'>Patrise’s death, for she owed him never none ill will, nor none of the</a>
<a id='line_12618'>four-and-twenty knights that were at that dinner; for I dare say for</a>
<a id='line_12619'>good love she bade us to dinner, and not for no mal engine, and that I</a>
<a id='line_12620'>doubt not shall be proved hereafter, for howsomever the game goeth,</a>
<a id='line_12621'>there was treason among us. Then some said to Sir Bors: We may well</a>
<a id='line_12622'>believe your words. And so some of them were well pleased, and some</a>
<a id='line_12623'>were not so.</a>
<a id='line_12624'></a>
<a id='line_12625'></a>
<a id='line_12626'></a>
<a id='line_12627'></a>
<a id='line_12628'>CHAPTER VI. How at the day Sir Bors made him ready for to fight for the</a>
<a id='line_12629'>queen; and when he would fight how another discharged him.</a>
<a id='line_12630'></a>
<a id='line_12631'></a>
<a id='line_12632'>The day came on fast until the even that the battle should be. Then the</a>
<a id='line_12633'>queen sent for Sir Bors and asked him how he was disposed. Truly madam,</a>
<a id='line_12634'>said he, I am disposed in likewise as I promised you, that is for to</a>
<a id='line_12635'>say I shall not fail you, unless by adventure there come a better</a>
<a id='line_12636'>knight than I am to do battle for you, then, madam, am I discharged of</a>
<a id='line_12637'>my promise. Will ye, said the queen, that I tell my lord Arthur thus?</a>
<a id='line_12638'>Do as it shall please you, madam. Then the queen went unto the king and</a>
<a id='line_12639'>told him the answer of Sir Bors. Have ye no doubt, said the king, of</a>
<a id='line_12640'>Sir Bors, for I call him now one of the best knights of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_12641'>the most profitablest man. And thus it passed on until the morn, and</a>
<a id='line_12642'>the king and the queen and all manner of knights that were there at</a>
<a id='line_12643'>that time drew them unto the meadow beside Westminster where the battle</a>
<a id='line_12644'>should be. And so when the king was come with the queen and many</a>
<a id='line_12645'>knights of the Round Table, then the queen was put there in the</a>
<a id='line_12646'>Constable’s ward, and a great fire made about an iron stake, that an</a>
<a id='line_12647'>Sir Mador de la Porte had the better, she should be burnt: such custom</a>
<a id='line_12648'>was used in those days, that neither for favour, neither for love nor</a>
<a id='line_12649'>affinity, there should be none other but righteous judgment, as well</a>
<a id='line_12650'>upon a king as upon a knight, and as well upon a queen as upon another</a>
<a id='line_12651'>poor lady.</a>
<a id='line_12652'></a>
<a id='line_12653'>So in this meanwhile came in Sir Mador de la Porte, and took his oath</a>
<a id='line_12654'>afore the king, that the queen did this treason until his cousin Sir</a>
<a id='line_12655'>Patrise, and unto his oath he would prove it with his body, hand for</a>
<a id='line_12656'>hand, who that would say the contrary. Right so came in Sir Bors de</a>
<a id='line_12657'>Ganis, and said: That as for Queen Guenever she is in the right, and</a>
<a id='line_12658'>that will I make good with my hands that she is not culpable of this</a>
<a id='line_12659'>treason that is put upon her. Then make thee ready, said Sir Mador, and</a>
<a id='line_12660'>we shall prove whether thou be in the right or I. Sir Mador, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12661'>Bors, wit thou well I know you for a good knight. Not for then I shall</a>
<a id='line_12662'>not fear you so greatly, but I trust to God I shall be able to</a>
<a id='line_12663'>withstand your malice. But this much have I promised my lord Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_12664'>my lady the queen, that I shall do battle for her in this case to the</a>
<a id='line_12665'>uttermost, unless that there come a better knight than I am and</a>
<a id='line_12666'>discharge me. Is that all? said Sir Mador, either come thou off and do</a>
<a id='line_12667'>battle with me, or else say nay. Take your horse, said Sir Bors, and as</a>
<a id='line_12668'>I suppose, ye shall not tarry long but ye shall be answered.</a>
<a id='line_12669'></a>
<a id='line_12670'>Then either departed to their tents and made them ready to horseback as</a>
<a id='line_12671'>they thought best. And anon Sir Mador came into the field with his</a>
<a id='line_12672'>shield on his shoulder and his spear in his hand; and so rode about the</a>
<a id='line_12673'>place crying unto Arthur: Bid your champion come forth an he dare. Then</a>
<a id='line_12674'>was Sir Bors ashamed and took his horse and came to the lists’ end. And</a>
<a id='line_12675'>then was he ware where came from a wood there fast by a knight all</a>
<a id='line_12676'>armed, upon a white horse, with a strange shield of strange arms; and</a>
<a id='line_12677'>he came riding all that he might run, and so he came to Sir Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_12678'>said thus: Fair knight, I pray you be not displeased, for here must a</a>
<a id='line_12679'>better knight than ye are have this battle, therefore I pray you</a>
<a id='line_12680'>withdraw you. For wit ye well I have had this day a right great</a>
<a id='line_12681'>journey, and this battle ought to be mine, and so I promised you when I</a>
<a id='line_12682'>spake with you last, and with all my heart I thank you of your good</a>
<a id='line_12683'>will. Then Sir Bors rode unto King Arthur and told him how there was a</a>
<a id='line_12684'>knight come that would have the battle for to fight for the queen. What</a>
<a id='line_12685'>knight is he? said the king. I wot not, said Sir Bors, but such</a>
<a id='line_12686'>covenant he made with me to be here this day. Now my lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12687'>Bors, here am I discharged.</a>
<a id='line_12688'></a>
<a id='line_12689'></a>
<a id='line_12690'></a>
<a id='line_12691'></a>
<a id='line_12692'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot fought against Sir Mador for the queen,</a>
<a id='line_12693'>and how he overcame Sir Mador, and discharged the queen.</a>
<a id='line_12694'></a>
<a id='line_12695'></a>
<a id='line_12696'>Then the king called to that knight, and asked him if he would fight</a>
<a id='line_12697'>for the queen. Then he answered to the king: Therefore came I hither,</a>
<a id='line_12698'>and therefore, sir king, he said, tarry me no longer, for I may not</a>
<a id='line_12699'>tarry. For anon as I have finished this battle I must depart hence, for</a>
<a id='line_12700'>I have ado many matters elsewhere. For wit you well, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_12701'>this is dishonour to you all knights of the Round Table, to see and</a>
<a id='line_12702'>know so noble a lady and so courteous a queen as Queen Guenever is,</a>
<a id='line_12703'>thus to be rebuked and shamed amongst you. Then they all marvelled what</a>
<a id='line_12704'>knight that might be that so took the battle upon him. For there was</a>
<a id='line_12705'>not one that knew him, but if it were Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_12706'></a>
<a id='line_12707'>Then said Sir Mador de la Porte unto the king: Now let me wit with whom</a>
<a id='line_12708'>I shall have ado withal. And then they rode to the lists’ end, and</a>
<a id='line_12709'>there they couched their spears, and ran together with all their might,</a>
<a id='line_12710'>and Sir Mador’s spear brake all to pieces, but the other’s spear held,</a>
<a id='line_12711'>and bare Sir Mador’s horse and all backward to the earth a great fall.</a>
<a id='line_12712'>But mightily and suddenly he avoided his horse and put his shield afore</a>
<a id='line_12713'>him, and then drew his sword, and bade the other knight alight and do</a>
<a id='line_12714'>battle with him on foot. Then that knight descended from his horse</a>
<a id='line_12715'>lightly like a valiant man, and put his shield afore him and drew his</a>
<a id='line_12716'>sword; and so they came eagerly unto battle, and either gave other many</a>
<a id='line_12717'>great strokes, tracing and traversing, racing and foining, and hurtling</a>
<a id='line_12718'>together with their swords as it were wild boars. Thus were they</a>
<a id='line_12719'>fighting nigh an hour, for this Sir Mador was a strong knight, and</a>
<a id='line_12720'>mightily proved in many strong battles. But at the last this knight</a>
<a id='line_12721'>smote Sir Mador grovelling upon the earth, and the knight stepped near</a>
<a id='line_12722'>him to have pulled Sir Mador flatling upon the ground; and therewith</a>
<a id='line_12723'>suddenly Sir Mador arose, and in his rising he smote that knight</a>
<a id='line_12724'>through the thick of the thighs that the blood ran out fiercely. And</a>
<a id='line_12725'>when he felt himself so wounded, and saw his blood, he let him arise</a>
<a id='line_12726'>upon his feet. And then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he</a>
<a id='line_12727'>fell to the earth flatling, and therewith he strode to him to have</a>
<a id='line_12728'>pulled off his helm off his head. And then Sir Mador prayed that knight</a>
<a id='line_12729'>to save his life, and so he yielded him as overcome, and released the</a>
<a id='line_12730'>queen of his quarrel. I will not grant thee thy life, said that knight,</a>
<a id='line_12731'>only that thou freely release the queen for ever, and that no mention</a>
<a id='line_12732'>be made upon Sir Patrise’s tomb that ever Queen Guenever consented to</a>
<a id='line_12733'>that treason. All this shall be done, said Sir Mador, I clearly</a>
<a id='line_12734'>discharge my quarrel for ever.</a>
<a id='line_12735'></a>
<a id='line_12736'>Then the knights parters of the lists took up Sir Mador, and led him to</a>
<a id='line_12737'>his tent, and the other knight went straight to the stair-foot where</a>
<a id='line_12738'>sat King Arthur; and by that time was the queen come to the king, and</a>
<a id='line_12739'>either kissed other heartily. And when the king saw that knight, he</a>
<a id='line_12740'>stooped down to him, and thanked him, and in likewise did the queen;</a>
<a id='line_12741'>and the king prayed him to put off his helmet, and to repose him, and</a>
<a id='line_12742'>to take a sop of wine. And then he put off his helm to drink, and then</a>
<a id='line_12743'>every knight knew him that it was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Anon as the</a>
<a id='line_12744'>king wist that, he took the queen in his hand, and yode unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12745'>Launcelot, and said: Sir, grant mercy of your great travail that ye</a>
<a id='line_12746'>have had this day for me and for my queen. My lord, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_12747'>wit ye well I ought of right ever to be in your quarrel, and in my lady</a>
<a id='line_12748'>the queen’s quarrel, to do battle; for ye are the man that gave me the</a>
<a id='line_12749'>high order of knighthood, and that day my lady, your queen, did me</a>
<a id='line_12750'>great worship, and else I had been shamed; for that same day ye made me</a>
<a id='line_12751'>knight, through my hastiness I lost my sword, and my lady, your queen,</a>
<a id='line_12752'>found it, and lapped it in her train, and gave me my sword when I had</a>
<a id='line_12753'>need thereto, and else had I been shamed among all knights; and</a>
<a id='line_12754'>therefore, my lord Arthur, I promised her at that day ever to be her</a>
<a id='line_12755'>knight in right outher in wrong. Grant mercy, said the king, for this</a>
<a id='line_12756'>journey; and wit ye well, said the king, I shall acquit your goodness.</a>
<a id='line_12757'></a>
<a id='line_12758'>And ever the queen beheld Sir Launcelot, and wept so tenderly that she</a>
<a id='line_12759'>sank almost to the ground for sorrow that he had done to her so great</a>
<a id='line_12760'>goodness where she shewed him great unkindness. Then the knights of his</a>
<a id='line_12761'>blood drew unto him, and there either of them made great joy of other.</a>
<a id='line_12762'>And so came all the knights of the Table Round that were there at that</a>
<a id='line_12763'>time, and welcomed him. And then Sir Mador was had to leech-craft, and</a>
<a id='line_12764'>Sir Launcelot was healed of his wound. And then there was made great</a>
<a id='line_12765'>joy and mirths in that court.</a>
<a id='line_12766'></a>
<a id='line_12767'></a>
<a id='line_12768'></a>
<a id='line_12769'></a>
<a id='line_12770'>CHAPTER VIII. How the truth was known by the Maiden of the Lake, and of</a>
<a id='line_12771'>divers other matters.</a>
<a id='line_12772'></a>
<a id='line_12773'></a>
<a id='line_12774'>And so it befell that the damosel of the lake, her name was Nimue, the</a>
<a id='line_12775'>which wedded the good knight Sir Pelleas, and so she came to the court;</a>
<a id='line_12776'>for ever she did great goodness unto King Arthur and to all his knights</a>
<a id='line_12777'>through her sorcery and enchantments. And so when she heard how the</a>
<a id='line_12778'>queen was an-angered for the death of Sir Patrise, then she told it</a>
<a id='line_12779'>openly that she was never guilty; and there she disclosed by whom it</a>
<a id='line_12780'>was done, and named him, Sir Pinel; and for what cause he did it, there</a>
<a id='line_12781'>it was openly disclosed; and so the queen was excused, and the knight</a>
<a id='line_12782'>Pinel fled into his country. Then was it openly known that Sir Pinel</a>
<a id='line_12783'>enpoisoned the apples at the feast to that intent to have destroyed Sir</a>
<a id='line_12784'>Gawaine, because Sir Gawaine and his brethren destroyed Sir Lamorak de</a>
<a id='line_12785'>Galis, to the which Sir Pinel was cousin unto. Then was Sir Patrise</a>
<a id='line_12786'>buried in the church of Westminster in a tomb, and thereupon was</a>
<a id='line_12787'>written: Here lieth Sir Patrise of Ireland, slain by Sir Pinel le</a>
<a id='line_12788'>Savage, that enpoisoned apples to have slain Sir Gawaine, and by</a>
<a id='line_12789'>misfortune Sir Patrise ate one of those apples, and then suddenly he</a>
<a id='line_12790'>brast. Also there was written upon the tomb that Queen Guenever was</a>
<a id='line_12791'>appealed of treason of the death of Sir Patrise, by Sir Mador de la</a>
<a id='line_12792'>Porte; and there was made mention how Sir Launcelot fought with him for</a>
<a id='line_12793'>Queen Guenever, and overcame him in plain battle. All this was written</a>
<a id='line_12794'>upon the tomb of Sir Patrise in excusing of the queen. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_12795'>Mador sued daily and long, to have the queen’s good grace; and so by</a>
<a id='line_12796'>the means of Sir Launcelot he caused him to stand in the queen’s good</a>
<a id='line_12797'>grace, and all was forgiven.</a>
<a id='line_12798'></a>
<a id='line_12799'>Thus it passed on till our Lady Day, Assumption. Within a fifteen days</a>
<a id='line_12800'>of that feast the king let cry a great jousts and a tournament that</a>
<a id='line_12801'>should be at that day at Camelot, that is Winchester; and the king let</a>
<a id='line_12802'>cry that he and the King of Scots would joust against all that would</a>
<a id='line_12803'>come against them. And when this cry was made, thither came many</a>
<a id='line_12804'>knights. So there came thither the King of Northgalis, and King Anguish</a>
<a id='line_12805'>of Ireland, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_12806'>haut prince, and the King of Northumberland, and many other noble dukes</a>
<a id='line_12807'>and earls of divers countries. So King Arthur made him ready to depart</a>
<a id='line_12808'>to these jousts, and would have had the queen with him, but at that</a>
<a id='line_12809'>time she would not, she said, for she was sick and might not ride at</a>
<a id='line_12810'>that time. That me repenteth, said the king, for this seven year ye saw</a>
<a id='line_12811'>not such a noble fellowship together except at Whitsuntide when Galahad</a>
<a id='line_12812'>departed from the court. Truly, said the queen to the king, ye must</a>
<a id='line_12813'>hold me excused, I may not be there, and that me repenteth. And many</a>
<a id='line_12814'>deemed the queen would not be there because of Sir Launcelot du Lake,</a>
<a id='line_12815'>for Sir Launcelot would not ride with the king, for he said that he was</a>
<a id='line_12816'>not whole of the wound the which Sir Mador had given him; wherefore the</a>
<a id='line_12817'>king was heavy and passing wroth. And so he departed toward Winchester</a>
<a id='line_12818'>with his fellowship; and so by the way the king lodged in a town called</a>
<a id='line_12819'>Astolat, that is now in English called Guildford, and there the king</a>
<a id='line_12820'>lay in the castle.</a>
<a id='line_12821'></a>
<a id='line_12822'>So when the king was departed the queen called Sir Launcelot to her,</a>
<a id='line_12823'>and said thus: Sir Launcelot, ye are greatly to blame thus to hold you</a>
<a id='line_12824'>behind my lord; what, trow ye, what will your enemies and mine say and</a>
<a id='line_12825'>deem? nought else but, See how Sir Launcelot holdeth him ever behind</a>
<a id='line_12826'>the king, and so doth the queen, for that they would have their</a>
<a id='line_12827'>pleasure together. And thus will they say, said the queen to Sir</a>
<a id='line_12828'>Launcelot, have ye no doubt thereof.</a>
<a id='line_12829'></a>
<a id='line_12830'></a>
<a id='line_12831'></a>
<a id='line_12832'></a>
<a id='line_12833'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot rode to Astolat, and received a sleeve to</a>
<a id='line_12834'>wear upon his helm at the request of a maid.</a>
<a id='line_12835'></a>
<a id='line_12836'></a>
<a id='line_12837'>Madam, said Sir Launcelot, I allow your wit, it is of late come since</a>
<a id='line_12838'>ye were wise. And therefore, madam, at this time I will be ruled by</a>
<a id='line_12839'>your counsel, and this night I will take my rest, and to-morrow by time</a>
<a id='line_12840'>I will take my way toward Winchester. But wit you well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12841'>Launcelot to the queen, that at that jousts I will be against the king,</a>
<a id='line_12842'>and against all his fellowship. Ye may there do as ye list, said the</a>
<a id='line_12843'>queen, but by my counsel ye shall not be against your king and your</a>
<a id='line_12844'>fellowship. For therein be full many hard knights of your blood, as ye</a>
<a id='line_12845'>wot well enough, it needeth not to rehearse them. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12846'>Launcelot, I pray you that ye be not displeased with me, for I will</a>
<a id='line_12847'>take the adventure that God will send me.</a>
<a id='line_12848'></a>
<a id='line_12849'>And so upon the morn early Sir Launcelot heard mass and brake his fast,</a>
<a id='line_12850'>and so took his leave of the queen and departed. And then he rode so</a>
<a id='line_12851'>much until he came to Astolat, that is Guildford; and there it happed</a>
<a id='line_12852'>him in the eventide he came to an old baron’s place that hight Sir</a>
<a id='line_12853'>Bernard of Astolat. And as Sir Launcelot entered into his lodging, King</a>
<a id='line_12854'>Arthur espied him as he did walk in a garden beside the castle, how he</a>
<a id='line_12855'>took his lodging, and knew him full well. It is well, said King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_12856'>unto the knights that were with him in that garden beside the castle, I</a>
<a id='line_12857'>have now espied one knight that will play his play at the jousts to the</a>
<a id='line_12858'>which we be gone toward; I undertake he will do marvels. Who is that,</a>
<a id='line_12859'>we pray you tell us? said many knights that were there at that time. Ye</a>
<a id='line_12860'>shall not wit for me, said the king, as at this time. And so the king</a>
<a id='line_12861'>smiled, and went to his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_12862'></a>
<a id='line_12863'>So when Sir Launcelot was in his lodging, and unarmed him in his</a>
<a id='line_12864'>chamber, the old baron and hermit came to him making his reverence, and</a>
<a id='line_12865'>welcomed him in the best manner; but the old knight knew not Sir</a>
<a id='line_12866'>Launcelot. Fair sir, said Sir Launcelot to his host, I would pray you</a>
<a id='line_12867'>to lend me a shield that were not openly known, for mine is well known.</a>
<a id='line_12868'>Sir, said his host, ye shall have your desire, for meseemeth ye be one</a>
<a id='line_12869'>of the likeliest knights of the world, and therefore I shall shew you</a>
<a id='line_12870'>friendship. Sir, wit you well I have two sons that were but late made</a>
<a id='line_12871'>knights, and the eldest hight Sir Tirre, and he was hurt that same day</a>
<a id='line_12872'>he was made knight, that he may not ride, and his shield ye shall have;</a>
<a id='line_12873'>for that is not known I dare say but here, and in no place else. And my</a>
<a id='line_12874'>youngest son hight Lavaine, and if it please you, he shall ride with</a>
<a id='line_12875'>you unto that jousts; and he is of his age strong and wight, for much</a>
<a id='line_12876'>my heart giveth unto you that ye should be a noble knight, therefore I</a>
<a id='line_12877'>pray you, tell me your name, said Sir Bernard. As for that, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12878'>Launcelot, ye must hold me excused as at this time, and if God give me</a>
<a id='line_12879'>grace to speed well at the jousts I shall come again and tell you. But</a>
<a id='line_12880'>I pray you, said Sir Launcelot, in any wise let me have your son, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12881'>Lavaine, with me, and that I may have his brother’s shield. All this</a>
<a id='line_12882'>shall be done, said Sir Bernard.</a>
<a id='line_12883'></a>
<a id='line_12884'>This old baron had a daughter that was called that time the Fair Maiden</a>
<a id='line_12885'>of Astolat. And ever she beheld Sir Launcelot wonderfully; and as the</a>
<a id='line_12886'>book saith, she cast such a love unto Sir Launcelot that she could</a>
<a id='line_12887'>never withdraw her love, wherefore she died, and her name was Elaine le</a>
<a id='line_12888'>Blank. So thus as she came to and fro she was so hot in her love that</a>
<a id='line_12889'>she besought Sir Launcelot to wear upon him at the jousts a token of</a>
<a id='line_12890'>hers. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, an if I grant you that, ye may</a>
<a id='line_12891'>say I do more for your love than ever I did for lady or damosel. Then</a>
<a id='line_12892'>he remembered him he would go to the jousts disguised. And because he</a>
<a id='line_12893'>had never fore that time borne no manner of token of no damosel, then</a>
<a id='line_12894'>he bethought him that he would bear one of her, that none of his blood</a>
<a id='line_12895'>thereby might know him, and then he said: Fair maiden, I will grant you</a>
<a id='line_12896'>to wear a token of yours upon mine helmet, and therefore what it is,</a>
<a id='line_12897'>shew it me. Sir, she said, it is a red sleeve of mine, of scarlet, well</a>
<a id='line_12898'>embroidered with great pearls: and so she brought it him. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_12899'>Launcelot received it, and said: Never did I erst so much for no</a>
<a id='line_12900'>damosel. And then Sir Launcelot betook the fair maiden his shield in</a>
<a id='line_12901'>keeping, and prayed her to keep that until that he came again; and so</a>
<a id='line_12902'>that night he had merry rest and great cheer, for ever the damosel</a>
<a id='line_12903'>Elaine was about Sir Launcelot all the while she might be suffered.</a>
<a id='line_12904'></a>

<a id='line_12907'></a>
<a id='line_12908'>CHAPTER X. How the tourney began at Winchester, and what knights were</a>
<a id='line_12909'>at the jousts; and other things.</a>
<a id='line_12910'></a>
<a id='line_12911'></a>
<a id='line_12912'>So upon a day, on the morn, King Arthur and all his knights departed,</a>
<a id='line_12913'>for their king had tarried three days to abide his noble knights. And</a>
<a id='line_12914'>so when the king was ridden, Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine made them</a>
<a id='line_12915'>ready to ride, and either of them had white shields, and the red sleeve</a>
<a id='line_12916'>Sir Launcelot let carry with him. And so they took their leave at Sir</a>
<a id='line_12917'>Bernard, the old baron, and at his daughter, the Fair Maiden of</a>
<a id='line_12918'>Astolat. And then they rode so long till that they came to Camelot,</a>
<a id='line_12919'>that time called Winchester; and there was great press of kings, dukes</a>
<a id='line_12920'>earls, and barons, and many noble knights. But there Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_12921'>lodged privily by the means of Sir Lavaine with a rich burgess, that no</a>
<a id='line_12922'>man in that town was ware what they were. And so they reposed them</a>
<a id='line_12923'>there till our Lady Day, Assumption, as the great feast should be. So</a>
<a id='line_12924'>then trumpets blew unto the field, and King Arthur was set on high upon</a>
<a id='line_12925'>a scaffold to behold who did best. But as the French book saith, the</a>
<a id='line_12926'>king would not suffer Sir Gawaine to go from him, for never had Sir</a>
<a id='line_12927'>Gawaine the better an Sir Launcelot were in the field; and many times</a>
<a id='line_12928'>was Sir Gawaine rebuked when Launcelot came into any jousts disguised.</a>
<a id='line_12929'></a>
<a id='line_12930'>Then some of the kings, as King Anguish of Ireland and the King of</a>
<a id='line_12931'>Scots, were that time turned upon the side of King Arthur. And then on</a>
<a id='line_12932'>the other party was the King of Northgalis, and the King with the</a>
<a id='line_12933'>Hundred Knights, and the King of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_12934'>haut prince. But these three kings and this duke were passing weak to</a>
<a id='line_12935'>hold against King Arthur’s party, for with him were the noblest knights</a>
<a id='line_12936'>of the world. So then they withdrew them either party from other, and</a>
<a id='line_12937'>every man made him ready in his best manner to do what he might.</a>
<a id='line_12938'></a>
<a id='line_12939'>Then Sir Launcelot made him ready, and put the red sleeve upon his</a>
<a id='line_12940'>head, and fastened it fast; and so Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_12941'>departed out of Winchester privily, and rode until a little leaved wood</a>
<a id='line_12942'>behind the party that held against King Arthur’s party, and there they</a>
<a id='line_12943'>held them still till the parties smote together. And then came in the</a>
<a id='line_12944'>King of Scots and the King of Ireland on Arthur’s party, and against</a>
<a id='line_12945'>them came the King of Northumberland, and the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_12946'>Knights smote down the King of Northumberland, and the King with the</a>
<a id='line_12947'>Hundred Knights smote down King Anguish of Ireland. Then Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_12948'>that was on Arthur’s party encountered with Sir Galahad, and either of</a>
<a id='line_12949'>them smote down other, and either party halp their lords on horseback</a>
<a id='line_12950'>again. So there began a strong assail upon both parties. And then came</a>
<a id='line_12951'>in Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12952'>Kay le Seneschal, Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Mordred, Sir Meliot</a>
<a id='line_12953'>de Logris, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Safere, Sir Epinogris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12954'>Galleron of Galway. All these fifteen knights were knights of the Table</a>
<a id='line_12955'>Round. So these with more other came in together, and beat aback the</a>
<a id='line_12956'>King of Northumberland and the King of Northgalis. When Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12957'>saw this, as he hoved in a little leaved wood, then he said unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_12958'>Lavaine: See yonder is a company of good knights, and they hold them</a>
<a id='line_12959'>together as boars that were chafed with dogs. That is truth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_12960'>Lavaine.</a>
<a id='line_12961'></a>
<a id='line_12962'></a>
<a id='line_12963'></a>
<a id='line_12964'></a>
<a id='line_12965'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine entered in the field</a>
<a id='line_12966'>against them of King Arthur’s court, and how Launcelot was hurt.</a>
<a id='line_12967'></a>
<a id='line_12968'></a>
<a id='line_12969'>Now, said Sir Launcelot, an ye will help me a little, ye shall see</a>
<a id='line_12970'>yonder fellowship that chaseth now these men in our side, that they</a>
<a id='line_12971'>shall go as fast backward as they went forward. Sir, spare not, said</a>
<a id='line_12972'>Sir Lavaine, for I shall do what I may. Then Sir Launcelot and Sir</a>
<a id='line_12973'>Lavaine came in at the thickest of the press, and there Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_12974'>smote down Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore, Sir Dodinas, Sir Kay, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12975'>Griflet, and all this he did with one spear; and Sir Lavaine smote down</a>
<a id='line_12976'>Sir Lucan le Butler and Sir Bedevere. And then Sir Launcelot gat</a>
<a id='line_12977'>another spear, and there he smote down Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and</a>
<a id='line_12978'>Sir Mordred, and Sir Meliot de Logris; and Sir Lavaine smote Ozanna le</a>
<a id='line_12979'>Cure Hardy. And then Sir Launcelot drew his sword, and there he smote</a>
<a id='line_12980'>on the right hand and on the left hand, and by great force he unhorsed</a>
<a id='line_12981'>Sir Safere, Sir Epinogris, and Sir Galleron; and then the knights of</a>
<a id='line_12982'>the Table Round withdrew them aback, after they had gotten their horses</a>
<a id='line_12983'>as well as they might. O mercy Jesu, said Sir Gawaine, what knight is</a>
<a id='line_12984'>yonder that doth so marvellous deeds of arms in that field? I wot well</a>
<a id='line_12985'>what he is, said King Arthur, but as at this time I will not name him.</a>
<a id='line_12986'>Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I would say it were Sir Launcelot by his riding</a>
<a id='line_12987'>and his buffets that I see him deal, but ever meseemeth it should not</a>
<a id='line_12988'>be he, for that he beareth the red sleeve upon his head; for I wist him</a>
<a id='line_12989'>never bear token at no jousts, of lady nor gentlewoman. Let him be,</a>
<a id='line_12990'>said King Arthur, he will be better known, and do more, or ever he</a>
<a id='line_12991'>depart.</a>
<a id='line_12992'></a>
<a id='line_12993'>Then the party that was against King Arthur were well comforted, and</a>
<a id='line_12994'>then they held them together that beforehand were sore rebuked. Then</a>
<a id='line_12995'>Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel called unto them the</a>
<a id='line_12996'>knights of their blood, as Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir</a>
<a id='line_12997'>Aliduke, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Bellangere le Beuse. So these</a>
<a id='line_12998'>nine knights of Sir Launcelot’s kin thrust in mightily, for they were</a>
<a id='line_12999'>all noble knights; and they, of great hate and despite that they had</a>
<a id='line_13000'>unto him, thought to rebuke that noble knight Sir Launcelot, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13001'>Lavaine, for they knew them not; and so they came hurling together, and</a>
<a id='line_13002'>smote down many knights of Northgalis and of Northumberland. And when</a>
<a id='line_13003'>Sir Launcelot saw them fare so, he gat a spear in his hand; and there</a>
<a id='line_13004'>encountered with him all at once Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and Sir Lionel,</a>
<a id='line_13005'>and all they three smote him at once with their spears. And with force</a>
<a id='line_13006'>of themself they smote Sir Launcelot’s horse to the earth; and by</a>
<a id='line_13007'>misfortune Sir Bors smote Sir Launcelot through the shield into the</a>
<a id='line_13008'>side, and the spear brake, and the head left still in his side.</a>
<a id='line_13009'></a>
<a id='line_13010'>When Sir Lavaine saw his master lie on the ground, he ran to the King</a>
<a id='line_13011'>of Scots and smote him to the earth; and by great force he took his</a>
<a id='line_13012'>horse, and brought him to Sir Launcelot, and maugre of them all he made</a>
<a id='line_13013'>him to mount upon that horse. And then Launcelot gat a spear in his</a>
<a id='line_13014'>hand, and there he smote Sir Bors, horse and man, to the earth. In the</a>
<a id='line_13015'>same wise he served Sir Ector and Sir Lionel; and Sir Lavaine smote</a>
<a id='line_13016'>down Sir Blamore de Ganis. And then Sir Launcelot drew his sword, for</a>
<a id='line_13017'>he felt himself so sore y-hurt that he weened there to have had his</a>
<a id='line_13018'>death. And then he smote Sir Bleoberis such a buffet on the helm that</a>
<a id='line_13019'>he fell down to the earth in a swoon. And in the same wise he served</a>
<a id='line_13020'>Sir Aliduke and Sir Galihud. And Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Bellangere,</a>
<a id='line_13021'>that was the son of Alisander le Orphelin.</a>
<a id='line_13022'></a>
<a id='line_13023'>And by this was Sir Bors horsed, and then he came with Sir Ector and</a>
<a id='line_13024'>Sir Lionel, and all they three smote with swords upon Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_13025'>helmet. And when he felt their buffets and his wound, the which was so</a>
<a id='line_13026'>grievous, then he thought to do what he might while he might endure.</a>
<a id='line_13027'>And then he gave Sir Bors such a buffet that he made him bow his head</a>
<a id='line_13028'>passing low; and therewithal he raced off his helm, and might have</a>
<a id='line_13029'>slain him; and so pulled him down, and in the same wise he served Sir</a>
<a id='line_13030'>Ector and Sir Lionel. For as the book saith he might have slain them,</a>
<a id='line_13031'>but when he saw their visages his heart might not serve him thereto,</a>
<a id='line_13032'>but left them there. And then afterward he hurled into the thickest</a>
<a id='line_13033'>press of them all, and did there the marvelloust deeds of arms that</a>
<a id='line_13034'>ever man saw or heard speak of, and ever Sir Lavaine, the good knight,</a>
<a id='line_13035'>with him. And there Sir Launcelot with his sword smote down and pulled</a>
<a id='line_13036'>down, as the French book maketh mention, mo than thirty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_13037'>the most part were of the Table Round; and Sir Lavaine did full well</a>
<a id='line_13038'>that day, for he smote down ten knights of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_13039'></a>
<a id='line_13040'></a>
<a id='line_13041'></a>
<a id='line_13042'></a>
<a id='line_13043'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed out of the</a>
<a id='line_13044'>field, and in what jeopardy Launcelot was.</a>
<a id='line_13045'></a>
<a id='line_13046'></a>
<a id='line_13047'>Mercy Jesu, said Sir Gawaine to Arthur, I marvel what knight that he is</a>
<a id='line_13048'>with the red sleeve. Sir, said King Arthur, he will be known or he</a>
<a id='line_13049'>depart. And then the king blew unto lodging, and the prize was given by</a>
<a id='line_13050'>heralds unto the knight with the white shield that bare the red sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_13051'>Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, the King of Northgalis,</a>
<a id='line_13052'>and the King of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince, and</a>
<a id='line_13053'>said unto Sir Launcelot: Fair knight, God thee bless, for much have ye</a>
<a id='line_13054'>done this day for us, therefore we pray you that ye will come with us</a>
<a id='line_13055'>that ye may receive the honour and the prize as ye have worshipfully</a>
<a id='line_13056'>deserved it. My fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well if I have</a>
<a id='line_13057'>deserved thanks I have sore bought it, and that me repenteth, for I am</a>
<a id='line_13058'>like never to escape with my life; therefore, fair lords, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_13059'>that ye will suffer me to depart where me liketh, for I am sore hurt. I</a>
<a id='line_13060'>take none force of none honour, for I had liefer to repose me than to</a>
<a id='line_13061'>be lord of all the world. And therewithal he groaned piteously, and</a>
<a id='line_13062'>rode a great wallop away-ward from them until he came under a wood’s</a>
<a id='line_13063'>side.</a>
<a id='line_13064'></a>
<a id='line_13065'>And when he saw that he was from the field nigh a mile, that he was</a>
<a id='line_13066'>sure he might not be seen, then he said with an high voice: O gentle</a>
<a id='line_13067'>knight, Sir Lavaine, help me that this truncheon were out of my side,</a>
<a id='line_13068'>for it sticketh so sore that it nigh slayeth me. O mine own lord, said</a>
<a id='line_13069'>Sir Lavaine, I would fain do that might please you, but I dread me sore</a>
<a id='line_13070'>an I pull out the truncheon that ye shall be in peril of death. I</a>
<a id='line_13071'>charge you, said Sir Launcelot, as ye love me, draw it out. And</a>
<a id='line_13072'>therewithal he descended from his horse, and right so did Sir Lavaine;</a>
<a id='line_13073'>and forthwithal Sir Lavaine drew the truncheon out of his side, and he</a>
<a id='line_13074'>gave a great shriek and a marvellous grisly groan, and the blood brast</a>
<a id='line_13075'>out nigh a pint at once, that at the last he sank down upon his</a>
<a id='line_13076'>buttocks, and so swooned pale and deadly. Alas, said Sir Lavaine, what</a>
<a id='line_13077'>shall I do? And then he turned Sir Launcelot into the wind, but so he</a>
<a id='line_13078'>lay there nigh half an hour as he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_13079'></a>
<a id='line_13080'>And so at the last Sir Launcelot cast up his eyes, and said: O Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_13081'>help me that I were on my horse, for here is fast by within this two</a>
<a id='line_13082'>mile a gentle hermit that sometime was a full noble knight and a great</a>
<a id='line_13083'>lord of possessions. And for great goodness he hath taken him to wilful</a>
<a id='line_13084'>poverty, and forsaken many lands, and his name is Sir Baudwin of</a>
<a id='line_13085'>Brittany, and he is a full noble surgeon and a good leech. Now let see,</a>
<a id='line_13086'>help me up that I were there, for ever my heart giveth me that I shall</a>
<a id='line_13087'>never die of my cousin-germain’s hands. And then with great pain Sir</a>
<a id='line_13088'>Lavaine halp him upon his horse. And then they rode a great wallop</a>
<a id='line_13089'>together, and ever Sir Launcelot bled that it ran down to the earth;</a>
<a id='line_13090'>and so by fortune they came to that hermitage the which was under a</a>
<a id='line_13091'>wood, and a great cliff on the other side, and a fair water running</a>
<a id='line_13092'>under it. And then Sir Lavaine beat on the gate with the butt of his</a>
<a id='line_13093'>spear, and cried fast: Let in for Jesu’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_13094'></a>
<a id='line_13095'>And there came a fair child to them, and asked them what they would.</a>
<a id='line_13096'>Fair son, said Sir Lavaine, go and pray thy lord, the hermit, for God’s</a>
<a id='line_13097'>sake to let in here a knight that is full sore wounded; and this day</a>
<a id='line_13098'>tell thy lord I saw him do more deeds of arms than ever I heard say</a>
<a id='line_13099'>that any man did. So the child went in lightly, and then he brought the</a>
<a id='line_13100'>hermit, the which was a passing good man. When Sir Lavaine saw him he</a>
<a id='line_13101'>prayed him for God’s sake of succour. What knight is he? said the</a>
<a id='line_13102'>hermit. Is he of the house of King Arthur, or not? I wot not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13103'>Lavaine, what is he, nor what is his name, but well I wot I saw him do</a>
<a id='line_13104'>marvellously this day as of deeds of arms. On whose party was he? said</a>
<a id='line_13105'>the hermit. Sir, said Sir Lavaine, he was this day against King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_13106'>and there he won the prize of all the knights of the Round Table. I</a>
<a id='line_13107'>have seen the day, said the hermit, I would have loved him the worse</a>
<a id='line_13108'>because he was against my lord, King Arthur, for sometime I was one of</a>
<a id='line_13109'>the fellowship of the Round Table, but I thank God now I am otherwise</a>
<a id='line_13110'>disposed. But where is he? let me see him. Then Sir Lavaine brought the</a>
<a id='line_13111'>hermit to him.</a>
<a id='line_13112'></a>
<a id='line_13113'></a>
<a id='line_13114'></a>
<a id='line_13115'></a>
<a id='line_13116'>CHAPTER XIII. How Launcelot was brought to an hermit for to be healed</a>
<a id='line_13117'>of his wound, and of other matters.</a>
<a id='line_13118'></a>
<a id='line_13119'></a>
<a id='line_13120'>And when the hermit beheld him, as he sat leaning upon his saddle-bow</a>
<a id='line_13121'>ever bleeding piteously, and ever the knight-hermit thought that he</a>
<a id='line_13122'>should know him, but he could not bring him to knowledge because he was</a>
<a id='line_13123'>so pale for bleeding. What knight are ye, said the hermit, and where</a>
<a id='line_13124'>were ye born? My fair lord, said Sir Launcelot, I am a stranger and a</a>
<a id='line_13125'>knight adventurous, that laboureth throughout many realms for to win</a>
<a id='line_13126'>worship. Then the hermit advised him better, and saw by a wound on his</a>
<a id='line_13127'>cheek that he was Sir Launcelot. Alas, said the hermit, mine own lord</a>
<a id='line_13128'>why lain you your name from me? Forsooth I ought to know you of right,</a>
<a id='line_13129'>for ye are the most noblest knight of the world, for well I know you</a>
<a id='line_13130'>for Sir Launcelot. Sir, said he, sith ye know me, help me an ye may,</a>
<a id='line_13131'>for God’s sake, for I would be out of this pain at once, either to</a>
<a id='line_13132'>death or to life. Have ye no doubt, said the hermit, ye shall live and</a>
<a id='line_13133'>fare right well. And so the hermit called to him two of his servants,</a>
<a id='line_13134'>and so he and his servants bare him into the hermitage, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_13135'>unarmed him, and laid him in his bed. And then anon the hermit</a>
<a id='line_13136'>staunched his blood, and made him to drink good wine, so that Sir</a>
<a id='line_13137'>Launcelot was well refreshed and knew himself; for in those days it was</a>
<a id='line_13138'>not the guise of hermits as is nowadays, for there were none hermits in</a>
<a id='line_13139'>those days but that they had been men of worship and of prowess; and</a>
<a id='line_13140'>those hermits held great household, and refreshed people that were in</a>
<a id='line_13141'>distress.</a>
<a id='line_13142'></a>
<a id='line_13143'>Now turn we unto King Arthur, and leave we Sir Launcelot in the</a>
<a id='line_13144'>hermitage. So when the kings were come together on both parties, and</a>
<a id='line_13145'>the great feast should be holden, King Arthur asked the King of</a>
<a id='line_13146'>Northgalis and their fellowship, where was that knight that bare the</a>
<a id='line_13147'>red sleeve: Bring him afore me that he may have his laud, and honour,</a>
<a id='line_13148'>and the prize, as it is right. Then spake Sir Galahad, the haut prince,</a>
<a id='line_13149'>and the King with the Hundred Knights: We suppose that knight is</a>
<a id='line_13150'>mischieved, and that he is never like to see you nor none of us all,</a>
<a id='line_13151'>and that is the greatest pity that ever we wist of any knight. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_13152'>said Arthur, how may this be, is he so hurt? What is his name? said</a>
<a id='line_13153'>King Arthur. Truly, said they all, we know not his name, nor from</a>
<a id='line_13154'>whence he came, nor whither he would. Alas, said the king, this be to</a>
<a id='line_13155'>me the worst tidings that came to me this seven year, for I would not</a>
<a id='line_13156'>for all the lands I wield to know and wit it were so that that noble</a>
<a id='line_13157'>knight were slain. Know ye him? said they all. As for that, said</a>
<a id='line_13158'>Arthur, whether I know him or know him not, ye shall not know for me</a>
<a id='line_13159'>what man he is, but Almighty Jesu send me good tidings of him. And so</a>
<a id='line_13160'>said they all. By my head, said Sir Gawaine, if it so be that the good</a>
<a id='line_13161'>knight be so sore hurt, it is great damage and pity to all this land,</a>
<a id='line_13162'>for he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw in a field handle</a>
<a id='line_13163'>a spear or a sword; and if he may be found I shall find him, for I am</a>
<a id='line_13164'>sure he nis not far from this town. Bear you well, said King Arthur, an</a>
<a id='line_13165'>ye may find him, unless that he be in such a plight that he may not</a>
<a id='line_13166'>wield himself. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine, but wit I shall what he</a>
<a id='line_13167'>is, an I may find him.</a>
<a id='line_13168'></a>
<a id='line_13169'>Right so Sir Gawaine took a squire with him upon hackneys, and rode all</a>
<a id='line_13170'>about Camelot within six or seven mile, but so he came again and could</a>
<a id='line_13171'>hear no word of him. Then within two days King Arthur and all the</a>
<a id='line_13172'>fellowship returned unto London again. And so as they rode by the way</a>
<a id='line_13173'>it happed Sir Gawaine at Astolat to lodge with Sir Bernard thereas was</a>
<a id='line_13174'>Sir Launcelot lodged. And so as Sir Gawaine was in his chamber to</a>
<a id='line_13175'>repose him Sir Bernard, the old baron, came unto him, and his daughter</a>
<a id='line_13176'>Elaine, to cheer him and to ask him what tidings, and who did best at</a>
<a id='line_13177'>that tournament of Winchester. So God me help, said Sir Gawaine, there</a>
<a id='line_13178'>were two knights that bare two white shields, but the one of them bare</a>
<a id='line_13179'>a red sleeve upon his head, and certainly he was one of the best</a>
<a id='line_13180'>knights that ever I saw joust in field. For I dare say, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13181'>Gawaine, that one knight with the red sleeve smote down forty knights</a>
<a id='line_13182'>of the Table Round, and his fellow did right well and worshipfully. Now</a>
<a id='line_13183'>blessed be God, said the Fair Maiden of Astolat, that that knight sped</a>
<a id='line_13184'>so well, for he is the man in the world that I first loved, and truly</a>
<a id='line_13185'>he shall be last that ever I shall love. Now, fair maid, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13186'>Gawaine, is that good knight your love? Certainly sir, said she, wit ye</a>
<a id='line_13187'>well he is my love. Then know ye his name? said Sir Gawaine. Nay truly,</a>
<a id='line_13188'>said the damosel, I know not his name nor from whence he cometh, but to</a>
<a id='line_13189'>say that I love him, I promise you and God that I love him. How had ye</a>
<a id='line_13190'>knowledge of him first? said Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_13191'></a>
<a id='line_13192'></a>
<a id='line_13193'></a>
<a id='line_13194'></a>
<a id='line_13195'>CHAPTER XIV. How Sir Gawaine was lodged with the lord of Astolat, and</a>
<a id='line_13196'>there had knowledge that it was Sir Launcelot that bare the red sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_13197'></a>
<a id='line_13198'></a>
<a id='line_13199'>Then she told him as ye have heard to-fore, and how her father betook</a>
<a id='line_13200'>him her brother to do him service, and how her father lent him her</a>
<a id='line_13201'>brother’s, Sir Tirre’s, shield: And here with me he left his own</a>
<a id='line_13202'>shield. For what cause did he so? said Sir Gawaine. For this cause,</a>
<a id='line_13203'>said the damosel, for his shield was too well known among many noble</a>
<a id='line_13204'>knights. Ah fair damosel, said Sir Gawaine, please it you let me have a</a>
<a id='line_13205'>sight of that shield. Sir, said she, it is in my chamber, covered with</a>
<a id='line_13206'>a case, and if ye will come with me ye shall see it. Not so, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13207'>Bernard till his daughter, let send for it.</a>
<a id='line_13208'></a>
<a id='line_13209'>So when the shield was come, Sir Gawaine took off the case, and when he</a>
<a id='line_13210'>beheld that shield he knew anon that it was Sir Launcelot’s shield, and</a>
<a id='line_13211'>his own arms. Ah Jesu mercy, said Sir Gawaine, now is my heart more</a>
<a id='line_13212'>heavier than ever it was to-fore. Why? said Elaine. For I have great</a>
<a id='line_13213'>cause, said Sir Gawaine. Is that knight that oweth this shield your</a>
<a id='line_13214'>love? Yea truly, said she, my love he is, God would I were his love. So</a>
<a id='line_13215'>God me speed, said Sir Gawaine, fair damosel ye have right, for an he</a>
<a id='line_13216'>be your love ye love the most honourable knight of the world, and the</a>
<a id='line_13217'>man of most worship. So me thought ever, said the damosel, for never or</a>
<a id='line_13218'>that time, for no knight that ever I saw, loved I never none erst. God</a>
<a id='line_13219'>grant, said Sir Gawaine, that either of you may rejoice other, but that</a>
<a id='line_13220'>is in a great adventure. But truly, said Sir Gawaine unto the damosel,</a>
<a id='line_13221'>ye may say ye have a fair grace, for why I have known that noble knight</a>
<a id='line_13222'>this four-and-twenty year, and never or that day, I nor none other</a>
<a id='line_13223'>knight, I dare make good, saw nor heard say that ever he bare token or</a>
<a id='line_13224'>sign of no lady, gentlewoman, ne maiden, at no jousts nor tournament.</a>
<a id='line_13225'>And therefore fair maiden, said Sir Gawaine, ye are much beholden to</a>
<a id='line_13226'>him to give him thanks. But I dread me, said Sir Gawaine, that ye shall</a>
<a id='line_13227'>never see him in this world, and that is great pity that ever was of</a>
<a id='line_13228'>earthly knight. Alas, said she, how may this be, is he slain? I say not</a>
<a id='line_13229'>so, said Sir Gawaine, but wit ye well he is grievously wounded, by all</a>
<a id='line_13230'>manner of signs, and by men’s sight more likelier to be dead than to be</a>
<a id='line_13231'>alive; and wit ye well he is the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, for by</a>
<a id='line_13232'>this shield I know him. Alas, said the Fair Maiden of Astolat, how may</a>
<a id='line_13233'>this be, and what was his hurt? Truly, said Sir Gawaine, the man in the</a>
<a id='line_13234'>world that loved him best hurt him so; and I dare say, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13235'>Gawaine, an that knight that hurt him knew the very certainty that he</a>
<a id='line_13236'>had hurt Sir Launcelot, it would be the most sorrow that ever came to</a>
<a id='line_13237'>his heart.</a>
<a id='line_13238'></a>
<a id='line_13239'>Now fair father, said then Elaine, I require you give me leave to ride</a>
<a id='line_13240'>and to seek him, or else I wot well I shall go out of my mind, for I</a>
<a id='line_13241'>shall never stint till that I find him and my brother, Sir Lavaine. Do</a>
<a id='line_13242'>as it liketh you, said her father, for me sore repenteth of the hurt of</a>
<a id='line_13243'>that noble knight. Right so the maid made her ready, and before Sir</a>
<a id='line_13244'>Gawaine, making great dole.</a>
<a id='line_13245'></a>
<a id='line_13246'>Then on the morn Sir Gawaine came to King Arthur, and told him how he</a>
<a id='line_13247'>had found Sir Launcelot’s shield in the keeping of the Fair Maiden of</a>
<a id='line_13248'>Astolat. All that knew I aforehand, said King Arthur, and that caused</a>
<a id='line_13249'>me I would not suffer you to have ado at the great jousts, for I</a>
<a id='line_13250'>espied, said King Arthur, when he came in till his lodging full late in</a>
<a id='line_13251'>the evening in Astolat. But marvel have I, said Arthur, that ever he</a>
<a id='line_13252'>would bear any sign of any damosel, for or now I never heard say nor</a>
<a id='line_13253'>knew that ever he bare any token of none earthly woman. By my head,</a>
<a id='line_13254'>said Sir Gawaine, the Fair Maiden of Astolat loveth him marvellously</a>
<a id='line_13255'>well; what it meaneth I cannot say, and she is ridden after to seek</a>
<a id='line_13256'>him. So the king and all came to London, and there Sir Gawaine openly</a>
<a id='line_13257'>disclosed to all the court that it was Sir Launcelot that jousted best.</a>
<a id='line_13258'></a>
<a id='line_13259'></a>
<a id='line_13260'></a>
<a id='line_13261'></a>
<a id='line_13262'>CHAPTER XV. Of the sorrow that Sir Bors had for the hurt of Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_13263'>and of the anger that the queen had because Launcelot bare the sleeve.</a>
<a id='line_13264'></a>
<a id='line_13265'></a>
<a id='line_13266'>And when Sir Bors heard that, wit ye well he was an heavy man, and so</a>
<a id='line_13267'>were all his kinsmen. But when Queen Guenever wist that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13268'>bare the red sleeve of the Fair Maiden of Astolat she was nigh out of</a>
<a id='line_13269'>her mind for wrath. And then she sent for Sir Bors de Ganis in all the</a>
<a id='line_13270'>haste that might be. So when Sir Bors was come to-fore the queen, then</a>
<a id='line_13271'>she said: Ah Sir Bors, have ye heard say how falsely Sir Launcelot hath</a>
<a id='line_13272'>betrayed me? Alas madam, said Sir Bors, I am afeard he hath betrayed</a>
<a id='line_13273'>himself and us all. No force, said the queen, though he be destroyed,</a>
<a id='line_13274'>for he is a false traitor-knight. Madam, said Sir Bors, I pray you say</a>
<a id='line_13275'>ye not so, for wit you well I may not hear such language of him. Why</a>
<a id='line_13276'>Sir Bors, said she, should I not call him traitor when he bare the red</a>
<a id='line_13277'>sleeve upon his head at Winchester, at the great jousts? Madam, said</a>
<a id='line_13278'>Sir Bors, that sleeve-bearing repenteth me sore, but I dare say he did</a>
<a id='line_13279'>it to none evil intent, but for this cause he bare the red sleeve that</a>
<a id='line_13280'>none of his blood should know him. For or then we, nor none of us all,</a>
<a id='line_13281'>never knew that ever he bare token or sign of maid, lady, ne</a>
<a id='line_13282'>gentlewoman. Fie on him, said the queen, yet for all his pride and</a>
<a id='line_13283'>bobaunce there ye proved yourself his better. Nay madam, say ye never</a>
<a id='line_13284'>more so, for he beat me and my fellows, and might have slain us an he</a>
<a id='line_13285'>had would. Fie on him, said the queen, for I heard Sir Gawaine say</a>
<a id='line_13286'>before my lord Arthur that it were marvel to tell the great love that</a>
<a id='line_13287'>is between the Fair Maiden of Astolat and him. Madam, said Sir Bors, I</a>
<a id='line_13288'>may not warn Sir Gawaine to say what it pleased him; but I dare say, as</a>
<a id='line_13289'>for my lord, Sir Launcelot, that he loveth no lady, gentlewoman, nor</a>
<a id='line_13290'>maid, but all he loveth in like much. And therefore madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13291'>Bors, ye may say what ye will, but wit ye well I will haste me to seek</a>
<a id='line_13292'>him, and find him wheresomever he be, and God send me good tidings of</a>
<a id='line_13293'>him. And so leave we them there, and speak we of Sir Launcelot that lay</a>
<a id='line_13294'>in great peril.</a>
<a id='line_13295'></a>
<a id='line_13296'>So as fair Elaine came to Winchester she sought there all about, and by</a>
<a id='line_13297'>fortune Sir Lavaine was ridden to play him, to enchafe his horse. And</a>
<a id='line_13298'>anon as Elaine saw him she knew him, and then she cried aloud until</a>
<a id='line_13299'>him. And when he heard her anon he came to her, and then she asked her</a>
<a id='line_13300'>brother how did my lord, Sir Launcelot. Who told you, sister, that my</a>
<a id='line_13301'>lord’s name was Sir Launcelot? Then she told him how Sir Gawaine by his</a>
<a id='line_13302'>shield knew him. So they rode together till that they came to the</a>
<a id='line_13303'>hermitage, and anon she alighted.</a>
<a id='line_13304'></a>
<a id='line_13305'>So Sir Lavaine brought her in to Sir Launcelot; and when she saw him</a>
<a id='line_13306'>lie so sick and pale in his bed she might not speak, but suddenly she</a>
<a id='line_13307'>fell to the earth down suddenly in a swoon, and there she lay a great</a>
<a id='line_13308'>while. And when she was relieved, she shrieked and said: My lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13309'>Launcelot, alas why be ye in this plight? and then she swooned again.</a>
<a id='line_13310'>And then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Lavaine to take her up: And bring her</a>
<a id='line_13311'>to me. And when she came to herself Sir Launcelot kissed her, and said:</a>
<a id='line_13312'>Fair maiden, why fare ye thus? ye put me to pain; wherefore make ye no</a>
<a id='line_13313'>more such cheer, for an ye be come to comfort me ye be right welcome;</a>
<a id='line_13314'>and of this little hurt that I have I shall be right hastily whole by</a>
<a id='line_13315'>the grace of God. But I marvel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my</a>
<a id='line_13316'>name? Then the fair maiden told him all how Sir Gawaine was lodged with</a>
<a id='line_13317'>her father: And there by your shield he discovered your name. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_13318'>said Sir Launcelot, that me repenteth that my name is known, for I am</a>
<a id='line_13319'>sure it will turn unto anger. And then Sir Launcelot compassed in his</a>
<a id='line_13320'>mind that Sir Gawaine would tell Queen Guenever how he bare the red</a>
<a id='line_13321'>sleeve, and for whom; that he wist well would turn into great anger.</a>
<a id='line_13322'></a>
<a id='line_13323'>So this maiden Elaine never went from Sir Launcelot, but watched him</a>
<a id='line_13324'>day and night, and did such attendance to him, that the French book</a>
<a id='line_13325'>saith there was never woman did more kindlier for man than she. Then</a>
<a id='line_13326'>Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Lavaine to make aspies in Winchester for Sir</a>
<a id='line_13327'>Bors if he came there, and told him by what tokens he should know him,</a>
<a id='line_13328'>by a wound in his forehead. For well I am sure, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13329'>that Sir Bors will seek me, for he is the same good knight that hurt</a>
<a id='line_13330'>me.</a>
<a id='line_13331'></a>
<a id='line_13332'></a>
<a id='line_13333'></a>
<a id='line_13334'></a>
<a id='line_13335'>CHAPTER XVI. How Sir Bors sought Launcelot and found him in the</a>
<a id='line_13336'>hermitage, and of the lamentation between them.</a>
<a id='line_13337'></a>
<a id='line_13338'></a>
<a id='line_13339'>Now turn we unto Sir Bors de Ganis that came unto Winchester to seek</a>
<a id='line_13340'>after his cousin Sir Launcelot. And so when he came to Winchester, anon</a>
<a id='line_13341'>there were men that Sir Lavaine had made to lie in a watch for such a</a>
<a id='line_13342'>man, and anon Sir Lavaine had warning; and then Sir Lavaine came to</a>
<a id='line_13343'>Winchester and found Sir Bors, and there he told him what he was, and</a>
<a id='line_13344'>with whom he was, and what was his name. Now fair knight, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13345'>Bors, I require you that ye will bring me to my lord, Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_13346'>Sir, said Sir Lavaine, take your horse, and within this hour ye shall</a>
<a id='line_13347'>see him. And so they departed, and came to the hermitage.</a>
<a id='line_13348'></a>
<a id='line_13349'>And when Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot lie in his bed pale and</a>
<a id='line_13350'>discoloured, anon Sir Bors lost his countenance, and for kindness and</a>
<a id='line_13351'>pity he might not speak, but wept tenderly a great while. And then when</a>
<a id='line_13352'>he might speak he said thus: O my lord, Sir Launcelot, God you bless,</a>
<a id='line_13353'>and send you hasty recover; and full heavy am I of my misfortune and of</a>
<a id='line_13354'>mine unhappiness, for now I may call myself unhappy. And I dread me</a>
<a id='line_13355'>that God is greatly displeased with me, that he would suffer me to have</a>
<a id='line_13356'>such a shame for to hurt you that are all our leader, and all our</a>
<a id='line_13357'>worship; and therefore I call myself unhappy. Alas that ever such a</a>
<a id='line_13358'>caitiff-knight as I am should have power by unhappiness to hurt the</a>
<a id='line_13359'>most noblest knight of the world. Where I so shamefully set upon you</a>
<a id='line_13360'>and overcharged you, and where ye might have slain me, ye saved me; and</a>
<a id='line_13361'>so did not I, for I and your blood did to you our utterance. I marvel,</a>
<a id='line_13362'>said Sir Bors, that my heart or my blood would serve me, wherefore my</a>
<a id='line_13363'>lord, Sir Launcelot, I ask your mercy. Fair cousin, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13364'>ye be right welcome; and wit ye well, overmuch ye say for to please me,</a>
<a id='line_13365'>the which pleaseth me not, for why I have the same I sought; for I</a>
<a id='line_13366'>would with pride have overcome you all, and there in my pride I was</a>
<a id='line_13367'>near slain, and that was in mine own default, for I might have given</a>
<a id='line_13368'>you warning of my being there. And then had I had no hurt, for it is an</a>
<a id='line_13369'>old said saw, there is hard battle thereas kin and friends do battle</a>
<a id='line_13370'>either against other, there may be no mercy but mortal war. Therefore,</a>
<a id='line_13371'>fair cousin, said Sir Launcelot, let this speech overpass, and all</a>
<a id='line_13372'>shall be welcome that God sendeth; and let us leave off this matter and</a>
<a id='line_13373'>let us speak of some rejoicing, for this that is done may not be</a>
<a id='line_13374'>undone; and let us find a remedy how soon that I may be whole.</a>
<a id='line_13375'></a>
<a id='line_13376'>Then Sir Bors leaned upon his bedside, and told Sir Launcelot how the</a>
<a id='line_13377'>queen was passing wroth with him, because he wore the red sleeve at the</a>
<a id='line_13378'>great jousts; and there Sir Bors told him all how Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_13379'>discovered it: By your shield that ye left with the Fair Maiden of</a>
<a id='line_13380'>Astolat. Then is the queen wroth, said Sir Launcelot and therefore am I</a>
<a id='line_13381'>right heavy, for I deserved no wrath, for all that I did was because I</a>
<a id='line_13382'>would not be known. Right so excused I you, said Sir Bors, but all was</a>
<a id='line_13383'>in vain, for she said more largelier to me than I to you now. But is</a>
<a id='line_13384'>this she, said Sir Bors, that is so busy about you, that men call the</a>
<a id='line_13385'>Fair Maiden of Astolat? She it is, said Sir Launcelot, that by no means</a>
<a id='line_13386'>I cannot put her from me. Why should ye put her from you? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13387'>Bors, she is a passing fair damosel, and a well beseen, and well</a>
<a id='line_13388'>taught; and God would, fair cousin, said Sir Bors, that ye could love</a>
<a id='line_13389'>her, but as to that I may not, nor I dare not, counsel you. But I see</a>
<a id='line_13390'>well, said Sir Bors, by her diligence about you that she loveth you</a>
<a id='line_13391'>entirely. That me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_13392'>she is not the first that hath lost her pain upon you, and that is the</a>
<a id='line_13393'>more pity: and so they talked of many more things. And so within three</a>
<a id='line_13394'>days or four Sir Launcelot was big and strong again.</a>
<a id='line_13395'></a>
<a id='line_13396'></a>
<a id='line_13397'></a>
<a id='line_13398'></a>
<a id='line_13399'>CHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot armed him to assay if he might bear</a>
<a id='line_13400'>arms, and how his wounds brast out again.</a>
<a id='line_13401'></a>
<a id='line_13402'></a>
<a id='line_13403'>Then Sir Bors told Sir Launcelot how there was sworn a great tournament</a>
<a id='line_13404'>and jousts betwixt King Arthur and the King of Northgalis, that should</a>
<a id='line_13405'>be upon All Hallowmass Day, beside Winchester. Is that truth? said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13406'>Launcelot; then shall ye abide with me still a little while until that</a>
<a id='line_13407'>I be whole, for I feel myself right big and strong. Blessed be God,</a>
<a id='line_13408'>said Sir Bors. Then were they there nigh a month together, and ever</a>
<a id='line_13409'>this maiden Elaine did ever her diligent labour night and day unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13410'>Launcelot, that there was never child nor wife more meeker to her</a>
<a id='line_13411'>father and husband than was that Fair Maiden of Astolat; wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_13412'>Bors was greatly pleased with her.</a>
<a id='line_13413'></a>
<a id='line_13414'>So upon a day, by the assent of Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13415'>Lavaine, they made the hermit to seek in woods for divers herbs, and so</a>
<a id='line_13416'>Sir Launcelot made fair Elaine to gather herbs for him to make him a</a>
<a id='line_13417'>bain. In the meanwhile Sir Launcelot made him to arm him at all pieces;</a>
<a id='line_13418'>and there he thought to assay his armour and his spear, for his hurt or</a>
<a id='line_13419'>not. And so when he was upon his horse he stirred him fiercely, and the</a>
<a id='line_13420'>horse was passing lusty and fresh because he was not laboured a month</a>
<a id='line_13421'>afore. And then Sir Launcelot couched that spear in the rest. That</a>
<a id='line_13422'>courser leapt mightily when he felt the spurs; and he that was upon</a>
<a id='line_13423'>him, the which was the noblest horse of the world, strained him</a>
<a id='line_13424'>mightily and stably, and kept still the spear in the rest; and</a>
<a id='line_13425'>therewith Sir Launcelot strained himself so straitly, with so great</a>
<a id='line_13426'>force, to get the horse forward, that the button of his wound brast</a>
<a id='line_13427'>both within and without; and therewithal the blood came out so fiercely</a>
<a id='line_13428'>that he felt himself so feeble that he might not sit upon his horse.</a>
<a id='line_13429'>And then Sir Launcelot cried unto Sir Bors: Ah, Sir Bors and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13430'>Lavaine, help, for I am come to mine end. And therewith he fell down on</a>
<a id='line_13431'>the one side to the earth like a dead corpse. And then Sir Bors and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13432'>Lavaine came to him with sorrow-making out of measure. And so by</a>
<a id='line_13433'>fortune the maiden Elaine heard their mourning, and then she came</a>
<a id='line_13434'>thither; and when she found Sir Launcelot there armed in that place she</a>
<a id='line_13435'>cried and wept as she had been wood; and then she kissed him, and did</a>
<a id='line_13436'>what she might to awake him. And then she rebuked her brother and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13437'>Bors, and called them false traitors, why they would take him out of</a>
<a id='line_13438'>his bed; there she cried, and said she would appeal them of his death.</a>
<a id='line_13439'></a>
<a id='line_13440'>With this came the holy hermit, Sir Baudwin of Brittany, and when he</a>
<a id='line_13441'>found Sir Launcelot in that plight he said but little, but wit ye well</a>
<a id='line_13442'>he was wroth; and then he bade them: Let us have him in. And so they</a>
<a id='line_13443'>all bare him unto the hermitage, and unarmed him, and laid him in his</a>
<a id='line_13444'>bed; and evermore his wound bled piteously, but he stirred no limb of</a>
<a id='line_13445'>him. Then the knight-hermit put a thing in his nose and a little deal</a>
<a id='line_13446'>of water in his mouth. And then Sir Launcelot waked of his swoon, and</a>
<a id='line_13447'>then the hermit staunched his bleeding. And when he might speak he</a>
<a id='line_13448'>asked Sir Launcelot why he put his life in jeopardy. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13449'>Launcelot, because I weened I had been strong, and also Sir Bors told</a>
<a id='line_13450'>me that there should be at All Hallowmass a great jousts betwixt King</a>
<a id='line_13451'>Arthur and the King of Northgalis, and therefore I thought to assay it</a>
<a id='line_13452'>myself whether I might be there or not. Ah, Sir Launcelot, said the</a>
<a id='line_13453'>hermit, your heart and your courage will never be done until your last</a>
<a id='line_13454'>day, but ye shall do now by my counsel. Let Sir Bors depart from you,</a>
<a id='line_13455'>and let him do at that tournament what he may: And by the grace of God,</a>
<a id='line_13456'>said the knight-hermit, by that the tournament be done and ye come</a>
<a id='line_13457'>hither again, Sir Launcelot shall be as whole as ye, so that he will be</a>
<a id='line_13458'>governed by me.</a>
<a id='line_13459'></a>
<a id='line_13460'></a>
<a id='line_13461'></a>
<a id='line_13462'></a>
<a id='line_13463'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Bors returned and told tidings of Sir Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_13464'>and of the tourney, and to whom the prize was given.</a>
<a id='line_13465'></a>
<a id='line_13466'></a>
<a id='line_13467'>Then Sir Bors made him ready to depart from Sir Launcelot; and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_13468'>Launcelot said: Fair cousin, Sir Bors, recommend me unto all them unto</a>
<a id='line_13469'>whom me ought to recommend me unto. And I pray you, enforce yourself at</a>
<a id='line_13470'>that jousts that ye may be best, for my love; and here shall I abide</a>
<a id='line_13471'>you at the mercy of God till ye come again. And so Sir Bors departed</a>
<a id='line_13472'>and came to the court of King Arthur, and told them in what place he</a>
<a id='line_13473'>had left Sir Launcelot. That me repenteth, said the king, but since he</a>
<a id='line_13474'>shall have his life we all may thank God. And there Sir Bors told the</a>
<a id='line_13475'>queen in what jeopardy Sir Launcelot was when he would assay his horse.</a>
<a id='line_13476'>And all that he did, madam, was for the love of you, because he would</a>
<a id='line_13477'>have been at this tournament. Fie on him, recreant knight, said the</a>
<a id='line_13478'>queen, for wit ye well I am right sorry an he shall have his life. His</a>
<a id='line_13479'>life shall he have, said Sir Bors, and who that would otherwise, except</a>
<a id='line_13480'>you, madam, we that be of his blood should help to short their lives.</a>
<a id='line_13481'>But madam, said Sir Bors, ye have been oft-times displeased with my</a>
<a id='line_13482'>lord, Sir Launcelot, but at all times at the end ye find him a true</a>
<a id='line_13483'>knight: and so he departed.</a>
<a id='line_13484'></a>
<a id='line_13485'>And then every knight of the Round Table that were there at that time</a>
<a id='line_13486'>present made them ready to be at that jousts at All Hallowmass, and</a>
<a id='line_13487'>thither drew many knights of divers countries. And as All Hallowmass</a>
<a id='line_13488'>drew near, thither came the King of Northgalis, and the King with the</a>
<a id='line_13489'>Hundred Knights, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince, of Surluse, and</a>
<a id='line_13490'>thither came King Anguish of Ireland, and the King of Scots. So these</a>
<a id='line_13491'>three kings came on King Arthur’s party. And so that day Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_13492'>did great deeds of arms, and began first. And the heralds numbered that</a>
<a id='line_13493'>Sir Gawaine smote down twenty knights. Then Sir Bors de Ganis came in</a>
<a id='line_13494'>the same time, and he was numbered that he smote down twenty knights;</a>
<a id='line_13495'>and therefore the prize was given betwixt them both, for they began</a>
<a id='line_13496'>first and longest endured. Also Sir Gareth, as the book saith, did that</a>
<a id='line_13497'>day great deeds of arms, for he smote down and pulled down thirty</a>
<a id='line_13498'>knights. But when he had done these deeds he tarried not but so</a>
<a id='line_13499'>departed, and therefore he lost his prize. And Sir Palomides did great</a>
<a id='line_13500'>deeds of arms that day, for he smote down twenty knights, but he</a>
<a id='line_13501'>departed suddenly, and men deemed Sir Gareth and he rode together to</a>
<a id='line_13502'>some manner adventures.</a>
<a id='line_13503'></a>
<a id='line_13504'>So when this tournament was done Sir Bors departed and rode till he</a>
<a id='line_13505'>came to Sir Launcelot, his cousin; and then he found him walking on his</a>
<a id='line_13506'>feet, and there either made great joy of other; and so Sir Bors told</a>
<a id='line_13507'>Sir Launcelot of all the Jousts like as ye have heard. I marvel, said</a>
<a id='line_13508'>Sir Launcelot, that Sir Gareth, when he had done such deeds of arms,</a>
<a id='line_13509'>that he would not tarry. Thereof we marvelled all, said Sir Bors, for</a>
<a id='line_13510'>but if it were you, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, I saw</a>
<a id='line_13511'>never knight bear down so many in so little a while as did Sir Gareth:</a>
<a id='line_13512'>and anon he was gone we wist not where. By my head, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13513'>he is a noble knight, and a mighty man and well breathed; and if he</a>
<a id='line_13514'>were well assayed, said Sir Launcelot I would deem he were good enough</a>
<a id='line_13515'>for any knight that beareth the life; and he is a gentle knight,</a>
<a id='line_13516'>courteous, true, and bounteous, meek, and mild, and in him is no manner</a>
<a id='line_13517'>of mal engin, but plain, faithful, and true.</a>
<a id='line_13518'></a>
<a id='line_13519'>So then they made them ready to depart from the hermit. And so upon a</a>
<a id='line_13520'>morn they took their horses and Elaine le Blank with them; and when</a>
<a id='line_13521'>they came to Astolat there were they well lodged, and had great cheer</a>
<a id='line_13522'>of Sir Bernard, the old baron, and of Sir Tirre, his son. And so upon</a>
<a id='line_13523'>the morn when Sir Launcelot should depart, fair Elaine brought her</a>
<a id='line_13524'>father with her, and Sir Lavaine, and Sir Tirre, and thus she said:</a>
<a id='line_13525'></a>
<a id='line_13526'></a>
<a id='line_13527'></a>
<a id='line_13528'></a>
<a id='line_13529'>CHAPTER XIX. Of the great lamentation of the Fair Maid of Astolat when</a>
<a id='line_13530'>Launcelot should depart, and how she died for his love.</a>
<a id='line_13531'></a>
<a id='line_13532'></a>
<a id='line_13533'>My lord, Sir Launcelot, now I see ye will depart; now fair knight and</a>
<a id='line_13534'>courteous knight, have mercy upon me, and suffer me not to die for thy</a>
<a id='line_13535'>love. What would ye that I did? said Sir Launcelot. I would have you to</a>
<a id='line_13536'>my husband, said Elaine. Fair damosel, I thank you, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13537'>but truly, said he, I cast me never to be wedded man. Then, fair</a>
<a id='line_13538'>knight, said she, will ye be my paramour? Jesu defend me, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13539'>Launcelot, for then I rewarded your father and your brother full evil</a>
<a id='line_13540'>for their great goodness. Alas, said she, then must I die for your</a>
<a id='line_13541'>love. Ye shall not so, said Sir Launcelot, for wit ye well, fair</a>
<a id='line_13542'>maiden, I might have been married an I had would, but I never applied</a>
<a id='line_13543'>me to be married yet; but because, fair damosel, that ye love me as ye</a>
<a id='line_13544'>say ye do, I will for your good will and kindness show you some</a>
<a id='line_13545'>goodness, and that is this, that wheresomever ye will beset your heart</a>
<a id='line_13546'>upon some good knight that will wed you, I shall give you together a</a>
<a id='line_13547'>thousand pound yearly to you and to your heirs; thus much will I give</a>
<a id='line_13548'>you, fair madam, for your kindness, and always while I live to be your</a>
<a id='line_13549'>own knight. Of all this, said the maiden, I will none, for but if ye</a>
<a id='line_13550'>will wed me, or else be my paramour at the least, wit you well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13551'>Launcelot, my good days are done. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of</a>
<a id='line_13552'>these two things ye must pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_13553'></a>
<a id='line_13554'>Then she shrieked shrilly, and fell down in a swoon; and then women</a>
<a id='line_13555'>bare her into her chamber, and there she made over much sorrow; and</a>
<a id='line_13556'>then Sir Launcelot would depart, and there he asked Sir Lavaine what he</a>
<a id='line_13557'>would do. What should I do, said Sir Lavaine, but follow you, but if ye</a>
<a id='line_13558'>drive me from you, or command me to go from you. Then came Sir Bernard</a>
<a id='line_13559'>to Sir Launcelot and said to him: I cannot see but that my daughter</a>
<a id='line_13560'>Elaine will die for your sake. I may not do withal, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13561'>for that me sore repenteth, for I report me to yourself, that my</a>
<a id='line_13562'>proffer is fair; and me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, that she loveth</a>
<a id='line_13563'>me as she doth; I was never the causer of it, for I report me to your</a>
<a id='line_13564'>son I early ne late proffered her bounté nor fair behests; and as for</a>
<a id='line_13565'>me, said Sir Launcelot, I dare do all that a knight should do that she</a>
<a id='line_13566'>is a clean maiden for me, both for deed and for will. And I am right</a>
<a id='line_13567'>heavy of her distress, for she is a full fair maiden, good and gentle,</a>
<a id='line_13568'>and well taught. Father, said Sir Lavaine, I dare make good she is a</a>
<a id='line_13569'>clean maiden as for my lord Sir Launcelot; but she doth as I do, for</a>
<a id='line_13570'>sithen I first saw my lord Sir Launcelot, I could never depart from</a>
<a id='line_13571'>him, nor nought I will an I may follow him.</a>
<a id='line_13572'></a>
<a id='line_13573'>Then Sir Launcelot took his leave, and so they departed, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_13574'>Winchester. And when Arthur wist that Sir Launcelot was come whole and</a>
<a id='line_13575'>sound the king made great joy of him, and so did Sir Gawaine and all</a>
<a id='line_13576'>the knights of the Round Table except Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_13577'>Also Queen Guenever was wood wroth with Sir Launcelot, and would by no</a>
<a id='line_13578'>means speak with him, but estranged herself from him; and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_13579'>made all the means that he might for to speak with the queen, but it</a>
<a id='line_13580'>would not be.</a>
<a id='line_13581'></a>
<a id='line_13582'>Now speak we of the Fair Maiden of Astolat that made such sorrow day</a>
<a id='line_13583'>and night that she never slept, ate, nor drank, and ever she made her</a>
<a id='line_13584'>complaint unto Sir Launcelot. So when she had thus endured a ten days,</a>
<a id='line_13585'>that she feebled so that she must needs pass out of this world, then</a>
<a id='line_13586'>she shrived her clean, and received her Creator. And ever she</a>
<a id='line_13587'>complained still upon Sir Launcelot. Then her ghostly father bade her</a>
<a id='line_13588'>leave such thoughts. Then she said, why should I leave such thoughts?</a>
<a id='line_13589'>Am I not an earthly woman? And all the while the breath is in my body I</a>
<a id='line_13590'>may complain me, for my belief is I do none offence though I love an</a>
<a id='line_13591'>earthly man; and I take God to my record I loved never none but Sir</a>
<a id='line_13592'>Launcelot du Lake, nor never shall, and a clean maiden I am for him and</a>
<a id='line_13593'>for all other; and sithen it is the sufferance of God that I shall die</a>
<a id='line_13594'>for the love of so noble a knight, I beseech the High Father of Heaven</a>
<a id='line_13595'>to have mercy upon my soul, and upon mine innumerable pains that I</a>
<a id='line_13596'>suffered may be allegeance of part of my sins. For sweet Lord Jesu,</a>
<a id='line_13597'>said the fair maiden, I take Thee to record, on Thee I was never great</a>
<a id='line_13598'>offencer against thy laws; but that I loved this noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13599'>Launcelot, out of measure, and of myself, good Lord, I might not</a>
<a id='line_13600'>withstand the fervent love wherefore I have my death.</a>
<a id='line_13601'></a>
<a id='line_13602'>And then she called her father, Sir Bernard, and her brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13603'>Tirre, and heartily she prayed her father that her brother might write</a>
<a id='line_13604'>a letter like as she did indite it: and so her father granted her. And</a>
<a id='line_13605'>when the letter was written word by word like as she devised, then she</a>
<a id='line_13606'>prayed her father that she might be watched until she were dead. And</a>
<a id='line_13607'>while my body is hot let this letter be put in my right hand, and my</a>
<a id='line_13608'>hand bound fast with the letter until that I be cold; and let me be put</a>
<a id='line_13609'>in a fair bed with all the richest clothes that I have about me, and so</a>
<a id='line_13610'>let my bed and all my richest clothes be laid with me in a chariot unto</a>
<a id='line_13611'>the next place where Thames is; and there let me be put within a</a>
<a id='line_13612'>barget, and but one man with me, such as ye trust to steer me thither,</a>
<a id='line_13613'>and that my barget be covered with black samite over and over: thus</a>
<a id='line_13614'>father I beseech you let it be done. So her father granted it her</a>
<a id='line_13615'>faithfully, all things should be done like as she had devised. Then her</a>
<a id='line_13616'>father and her brother made great dole, for when this was done anon she</a>
<a id='line_13617'>died. And so when she was dead the corpse and the bed all was led the</a>
<a id='line_13618'>next way unto Thames, and there a man, and the corpse, and all, were</a>
<a id='line_13619'>put into Thames; and so the man steered the barget unto Westminster,</a>
<a id='line_13620'>and there he rowed a great while to and fro or any espied it.</a>
<a id='line_13621'></a>
<a id='line_13622'></a>
<a id='line_13623'></a>
<a id='line_13624'></a>
<a id='line_13625'>CHAPTER XX. How the corpse of the Maid of Astolat arrived to-fore King</a>
<a id='line_13626'>Arthur, and of the burying, and how Sir Launcelot offered the</a>
<a id='line_13627'>mass-penny.</a>
<a id='line_13628'></a>
<a id='line_13629'></a>
<a id='line_13630'>So by fortune King Arthur and the Queen Guenever were speaking together</a>
<a id='line_13631'>at a window, and so as they looked into Thames they espied this black</a>
<a id='line_13632'>barget, and had marvel what it meant. Then the king called Sir Kay, and</a>
<a id='line_13633'>showed it him. Sir, said Sir Kay, wit you well there is some new</a>
<a id='line_13634'>tidings. Go thither, said the king to Sir Kay, and take with you Sir</a>
<a id='line_13635'>Brandiles and Agravaine, and bring me ready word what is there. Then</a>
<a id='line_13636'>these four knights departed and came to the barget and went in; and</a>
<a id='line_13637'>there they found the fairest corpse lying in a rich bed, and a poor man</a>
<a id='line_13638'>sitting in the barget’s end, and no word would he speak. So these four</a>
<a id='line_13639'>knights returned unto the king again, and told him what they found.</a>
<a id='line_13640'>That fair corpse will I see, said the king. And so then the king took</a>
<a id='line_13641'>the queen by the hand, and went thither.</a>
<a id='line_13642'></a>
<a id='line_13643'>Then the king made the barget to be holden fast, and then the king and</a>
<a id='line_13644'>the queen entered with certain knights with them; and there he saw the</a>
<a id='line_13645'>fairest woman lie in a rich bed, covered unto her middle with many rich</a>
<a id='line_13646'>clothes, and all was of cloth of gold, and she lay as though she had</a>
<a id='line_13647'>smiled. Then the queen espied a letter in her right hand, and told it</a>
<a id='line_13648'>to the king. Then the king took it and said: Now am I sure this letter</a>
<a id='line_13649'>will tell what she was, and why she is come hither. So then the king</a>
<a id='line_13650'>and the queen went out of the barget, and so commanded a certain man to</a>
<a id='line_13651'>wait upon the barget.</a>
<a id='line_13652'></a>
<a id='line_13653'>And so when the king was come within his chamber, he called many</a>
<a id='line_13654'>knights about him, and said that he would wit openly what was written</a>
<a id='line_13655'>within that letter. Then the king brake it, and made a clerk to read</a>
<a id='line_13656'>it, and this was the intent of the letter. Most noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13657'>Launcelot, now hath death made us two at debate for your love. I was</a>
<a id='line_13658'>your lover, that men called the Fair Maiden of Astolat; therefore unto</a>
<a id='line_13659'>all ladies I make my moan, yet pray for my soul and bury me at least,</a>
<a id='line_13660'>and offer ye my mass-penny: this is my last request. And a clean maiden</a>
<a id='line_13661'>I died, I take God to witness: pray for my soul, Sir Launcelot, as thou</a>
<a id='line_13662'>art peerless. This was all the substance in the letter. And when it was</a>
<a id='line_13663'>read, the king, the queen, and all the knights wept for pity of the</a>
<a id='line_13664'>doleful complaints. Then was Sir Launcelot sent for; and when he was</a>
<a id='line_13665'>come King Arthur made the letter to be read to him.</a>
<a id='line_13666'></a>
<a id='line_13667'>And when Sir Launcelot heard it word by word, he said: My lord Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_13668'>wit ye well I am right heavy of the death of this fair damosel: God</a>
<a id='line_13669'>knoweth I was never causer of her death by my willing, and that will I</a>
<a id='line_13670'>report me to her own brother: here he is, Sir Lavaine. I will not say</a>
<a id='line_13671'>nay, said Sir Launcelot, but that she was both fair and good, and much</a>
<a id='line_13672'>I was beholden unto her, but she loved me out of measure. Ye might have</a>
<a id='line_13673'>shewed her, said the queen, some bounty and gentleness that might have</a>
<a id='line_13674'>preserved her life. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, she would none other</a>
<a id='line_13675'>ways be answered but that she would be my wife, outher else my</a>
<a id='line_13676'>paramour; and of these two I would not grant her, but I proffered her,</a>
<a id='line_13677'>for her good love that she shewed me, a thousand pound yearly to her,</a>
<a id='line_13678'>and to her heirs, and to wed any manner knight that she could find best</a>
<a id='line_13679'>to love in her heart. For madam, said Sir Launcelot, I love not to be</a>
<a id='line_13680'>constrained to love; for love must arise of the heart, and not by no</a>
<a id='line_13681'>constraint. That is truth, said the king, and many knight’s love is</a>
<a id='line_13682'>free in himself, and never will be bounden, for where he is bounden he</a>
<a id='line_13683'>looseth himself.</a>
<a id='line_13684'></a>
<a id='line_13685'>Then said the king unto Sir Launcelot: It will be your worship that ye</a>
<a id='line_13686'>oversee that she be interred worshipfully. Sir, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13687'>that shall be done as I can best devise. And so many knights yede</a>
<a id='line_13688'>thither to behold that fair maiden. And so upon the morn she was</a>
<a id='line_13689'>interred richly, and Sir Launcelot offered her mass-penny; and all the</a>
<a id='line_13690'>knights of the Table Round that were there at that time offered with</a>
<a id='line_13691'>Sir Launcelot. And then the poor man went again with the barget. Then</a>
<a id='line_13692'>the queen sent for Sir Launcelot, and prayed him of mercy, for why that</a>
<a id='line_13693'>she had been wroth with him causeless. This is not the first time, said</a>
<a id='line_13694'>Sir Launcelot, that ye had been displeased with me causeless, but,</a>
<a id='line_13695'>madam, ever I must suffer you, but what sorrow I endure I take no</a>
<a id='line_13696'>force. So this passed on all that winter, with all manner of hunting</a>
<a id='line_13697'>and hawking, and jousts and tourneys were many betwixt many great</a>
<a id='line_13698'>lords, and ever in all places Sir Lavaine gat great worship, so that he</a>
<a id='line_13699'>was nobly renowned among many knights of the Table Round.</a>
<a id='line_13700'></a>
<a id='line_13701'></a>
<a id='line_13702'></a>
<a id='line_13703'></a>
<a id='line_13704'>CHAPTER XXI. Of great jousts done all a Christmas, and of a great</a>
<a id='line_13705'>jousts and tourney ordained by King Arthur, and of Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_13706'></a>
<a id='line_13707'></a>
<a id='line_13708'>Thus it passed on till Christmas, and then every day there was jousts</a>
<a id='line_13709'>made for a diamond, who that jousted best should have a diamond. But</a>
<a id='line_13710'>Sir Launcelot would not joust but if it were at a great jousts cried.</a>
<a id='line_13711'>But Sir Lavaine jousted there all that Christmas passingly well, and</a>
<a id='line_13712'>best was praised, for there were but few that did so well. Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_13713'>all manner of knights deemed that Sir Lavaine should be made knight of</a>
<a id='line_13714'>the Table Round at the next feast of Pentecost. So at-after Christmas</a>
<a id='line_13715'>King Arthur let call unto him many knights, and there they advised</a>
<a id='line_13716'>together to make a party and a great tournament and jousts. And the</a>
<a id='line_13717'>King of Northgalis said to Arthur, he would have on his party King</a>
<a id='line_13718'>Anguish of Ireland, and the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King</a>
<a id='line_13719'>of Northumberland, and Sir Galahad, the haut prince. And so these four</a>
<a id='line_13720'>kings and this mighty duke took part against King Arthur and the</a>
<a id='line_13721'>knights of the Table Round. And the cry was made that the day of the</a>
<a id='line_13722'>jousts should be beside Westminster upon Candlemas Day, whereof many</a>
<a id='line_13723'>knights were glad, and made them ready to be at that jousts in the</a>
<a id='line_13724'>freshest manner.</a>
<a id='line_13725'></a>
<a id='line_13726'>Then Queen Guenever sent for Sir Launcelot, and said thus: I warn you</a>
<a id='line_13727'>that ye ride no more in no jousts nor tournaments but that your kinsmen</a>
<a id='line_13728'>may know you. And at these jousts that shall be ye shall have of me a</a>
<a id='line_13729'>sleeve of gold; and I pray you for my sake enforce yourself there, that</a>
<a id='line_13730'>men may speak of you worship; but I charge you as ye will have my love,</a>
<a id='line_13731'>that ye warn your kinsmen that ye will bear that day the sleeve of gold</a>
<a id='line_13732'>upon your helmet. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, it shall be done. And so</a>
<a id='line_13733'>either made great joy of other. And when Sir Launcelot saw his time he</a>
<a id='line_13734'>told Sir Bors that he would depart, and have no more with him but Sir</a>
<a id='line_13735'>Lavaine, unto the good hermit that dwelt in that forest of Windsor; his</a>
<a id='line_13736'>name was Sir Brasias; and there he thought to repose him, and take all</a>
<a id='line_13737'>the rest that he might, because he would be fresh at that day of</a>
<a id='line_13738'>jousts.</a>
<a id='line_13739'></a>
<a id='line_13740'>So Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed, that no creature wist where</a>
<a id='line_13741'>he was become, but the noble men of his blood. And when he was come to</a>
<a id='line_13742'>the hermitage, wit ye well he had good cheer. And so daily Sir</a>
<a id='line_13743'>Launcelot would go to a well fast by the hermitage, and there he would</a>
<a id='line_13744'>lie down, and see the well spring and burble, and sometime he slept</a>
<a id='line_13745'>there. So at that time there was a lady dwelt in that forest, and she</a>
<a id='line_13746'>was a great huntress, and daily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her</a>
<a id='line_13747'>bow with her; and no men went never with her, but always women, and</a>
<a id='line_13748'>they were shooters, and could well kill a deer, both at the stalk and</a>
<a id='line_13749'>at the trest; and they daily bare bows and arrows, horns and</a>
<a id='line_13750'>wood-knives, and many good dogs they had, both for the string and for a</a>
<a id='line_13751'>bait. So it happed this lady the huntress had abated her dog for the</a>
<a id='line_13752'>bow at a barren hind, and so this barren hind took the flight over</a>
<a id='line_13753'>hedges and woods. And ever this lady and part of her women costed the</a>
<a id='line_13754'>hind, and checked it by the noise of the hounds, to have met with the</a>
<a id='line_13755'>hind at some water; and so it happed, the hind came to the well whereas</a>
<a id='line_13756'>Sir Launcelot was sleeping and slumbering. And so when the hind came to</a>
<a id='line_13757'>the well, for heat she went to soil, and there she lay a great while;</a>
<a id='line_13758'>and the dog came after, and umbecast about, for she had lost the very</a>
<a id='line_13759'>perfect feute of the hind. Right so came that lady the huntress, that</a>
<a id='line_13760'>knew by the dog that she had, that the hind was at the soil in that</a>
<a id='line_13761'>well; and there she came stiffly and found the hind, and she put a</a>
<a id='line_13762'>broad arrow in her bow, and shot at the hind, and over-shot the hind;</a>
<a id='line_13763'>and so by misfortune the arrow smote Sir Launcelot in the thick of the</a>
<a id='line_13764'>buttock, over the barbs. When Sir Launcelot felt himself so hurt, he</a>
<a id='line_13765'>hurled up woodly, and saw the lady that had smitten him. And when he</a>
<a id='line_13766'>saw she was a woman, he said thus: Lady or damosel, what that thou be,</a>
<a id='line_13767'>in an evil time bear ye a bow; the devil made you a shooter.</a>
<a id='line_13768'></a>
<a id='line_13769'></a>
<a id='line_13770'></a>
<a id='line_13771'></a>
<a id='line_13772'>CHAPTER XXII. How Launcelot after that he was hurt of a gentlewoman</a>
<a id='line_13773'>came to an hermit, and of other matters.</a>
<a id='line_13774'></a>
<a id='line_13775'></a>
<a id='line_13776'>Now mercy, fair sir, said the lady, I am a gentlewoman that useth here</a>
<a id='line_13777'>in this forest hunting, and God knoweth I saw ye not; but as here was a</a>
<a id='line_13778'>barren hind at the soil in this well, and I weened to have done well,</a>
<a id='line_13779'>but my hand swerved. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, ye have mischieved me.</a>
<a id='line_13780'>And so the lady departed, and Sir Launcelot as he might pulled out the</a>
<a id='line_13781'>arrow, and left that head still in his buttock, and so he went weakly</a>
<a id='line_13782'>to the hermitage ever more bleeding as he went. And when Sir Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_13783'>and the hermit espied that Sir Launcelot was hurt, wit you well they</a>
<a id='line_13784'>were passing heavy, but Sir Lavaine wist not how that he was hurt nor</a>
<a id='line_13785'>by whom. And then were they wroth out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_13786'></a>
<a id='line_13787'>Then with great pain the hermit gat out the arrow’s head out of Sir</a>
<a id='line_13788'>Launcelot’s buttock, and much of his blood he shed, and the wound was</a>
<a id='line_13789'>passing sore, and unhappily smitten, for it was in such a place that he</a>
<a id='line_13790'>might not sit in no saddle. Have mercy, Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, I may</a>
<a id='line_13791'>call myself the most unhappiest man that liveth, for ever when I would</a>
<a id='line_13792'>fainest have worship there befalleth me ever some unhappy thing. Now so</a>
<a id='line_13793'>Jesu me help, said Sir Launcelot, and if no man would but God, I shall</a>
<a id='line_13794'>be in the field upon Candlemas Day at the jousts, whatsomever fall of</a>
<a id='line_13795'>it: so all that might be gotten to heal Sir Launcelot was had.</a>
<a id='line_13796'></a>
<a id='line_13797'>So when the day was come Sir Launcelot let devise that he was arrayed,</a>
<a id='line_13798'>and Sir Lavaine, and their horses, as though they had been Saracens;</a>
<a id='line_13799'>and so they departed and came nigh to the field. The King of Northgalis</a>
<a id='line_13800'>with an hundred knights with him, and the King of Northumberland</a>
<a id='line_13801'>brought with him an hundred good knights, and King Anguish of Ireland</a>
<a id='line_13802'>brought with him an hundred good knights ready to joust, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13803'>Galahad, the haut prince, brought with him an hundred good knights, and</a>
<a id='line_13804'>the King with the Hundred Knights brought with him as many, and all</a>
<a id='line_13805'>these were proved good knights. Then came in King Arthur’s party; and</a>
<a id='line_13806'>there came in the King of Scots with an hundred knights, and King</a>
<a id='line_13807'>Uriens of Gore brought with him an hundred knights, and King Howel of</a>
<a id='line_13808'>Brittany brought with him an hundred knights, and Chaleins of Clarance</a>
<a id='line_13809'>brought with him an hundred knights, and King Arthur himself came into</a>
<a id='line_13810'>the field with two hundred knights, and the most part were knights of</a>
<a id='line_13811'>the Table Round, that were proved noble knights; and there were old</a>
<a id='line_13812'>knights set in scaffolds for to judge, with the queen, who did best.</a>
<a id='line_13813'></a>
<a id='line_13814'></a>
<a id='line_13815'></a>
<a id='line_13816'></a>
<a id='line_13817'>CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him at the jousts, and other</a>
<a id='line_13818'>men also.</a>
<a id='line_13819'></a>
<a id='line_13820'></a>
<a id='line_13821'>Then they blew to the field; and there the King of Northgalis</a>
<a id='line_13822'>encountered with the King of Scots, and there the King of Scots had a</a>
<a id='line_13823'>fall; and the King of Ireland smote down King Uriens; and the King of</a>
<a id='line_13824'>Northumberland smote down King Howel of Brittany; and Sir Galahad, the</a>
<a id='line_13825'>haut prince, smote down Chaleins of Clarance. And then King Arthur was</a>
<a id='line_13826'>wood wroth, and ran to the King with the Hundred Knights, and there</a>
<a id='line_13827'>King Arthur smote him down; and after with that same spear King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_13828'>smote down three other knights. And then when his spear was broken King</a>
<a id='line_13829'>Arthur did passingly well; and so therewithal came in Sir Gawaine and</a>
<a id='line_13830'>Sir Gaheris, Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, and there everych of them</a>
<a id='line_13831'>smote down a knight, and Sir Gawaine smote down four knights; and then</a>
<a id='line_13832'>there began a strong medley, for then there came in the knights of</a>
<a id='line_13833'>Launcelot’s blood, and Sir Gareth and Sir Palomides with them, and many</a>
<a id='line_13834'>knights of the Table Round, and they began to hold the four kings and</a>
<a id='line_13835'>the mighty duke so hard that they were discomfit; but this Duke</a>
<a id='line_13836'>Galahad, the haut prince, was a noble knight, and by his mighty prowess</a>
<a id='line_13837'>of arms he held the knights of the Table Round strait enough.</a>
<a id='line_13838'></a>
<a id='line_13839'>All this doing saw Sir Launcelot, and then he came into the field with</a>
<a id='line_13840'>Sir Lavaine as it had been thunder. And then anon Sir Bors and the</a>
<a id='line_13841'>knights of his blood espied Sir Launcelot, and said to them all: I warn</a>
<a id='line_13842'>you beware of him with the sleeve of gold upon his head, for he is</a>
<a id='line_13843'>himself Sir Launcelot du Lake; and for great goodness Sir Bors warned</a>
<a id='line_13844'>Sir Gareth. I am well apaid, said Sir Gareth, that I may know him. But</a>
<a id='line_13845'>who is he, said they all, that rideth with him in the same array? That</a>
<a id='line_13846'>is the good and gentle knight Sir Lavaine, said Sir Bors. So Sir</a>
<a id='line_13847'>Launcelot encountered with Sir Gawaine, and there by force Sir</a>
<a id='line_13848'>Launcelot smote down Sir Gawaine and his horse to the earth, and so he</a>
<a id='line_13849'>smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and also he smote down Sir</a>
<a id='line_13850'>Mordred, and all this was with one spear. Then Sir Lavaine met with Sir</a>
<a id='line_13851'>Palomides, and either met other so hard and so fiercely that both their</a>
<a id='line_13852'>horses fell to the earth. And then were they horsed again, and then met</a>
<a id='line_13853'>Sir Launcelot with Sir Palomides, and there Sir Palomides had a fall;</a>
<a id='line_13854'>and so Sir Launcelot or ever he stint, as fast as he might get spears,</a>
<a id='line_13855'>he smote down thirty knights, and the most part of them were knights of</a>
<a id='line_13856'>the Table Round; and ever the knights of his blood withdrew them, and</a>
<a id='line_13857'>made them ado in other places where Sir Launcelot came not.</a>
<a id='line_13858'></a>
<a id='line_13859'>And then King Arthur was wroth when he saw Sir Launcelot do such deeds;</a>
<a id='line_13860'>and then the king called unto him Sir Gawaine, Sir Mordred, Sir Kay,</a>
<a id='line_13861'>Sir Griflet, Sir Lucan the Butler, Sir Bedivere, Sir Palomides, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13862'>Safere, his brother; and so the king with these nine knights made them</a>
<a id='line_13863'>ready to set upon Sir Launcelot, and upon Sir Lavaine. All this espied</a>
<a id='line_13864'>Sir Bors and Sir Gareth. Now I dread me sore, said Sir Bors, that my</a>
<a id='line_13865'>lord, Sir Launcelot, will be hard matched. By my head, said Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_13866'>I will ride unto my lord Sir Launcelot, for to help him, fall of him</a>
<a id='line_13867'>what fall may, for he is the same man that made me knight. Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_13868'>so, said Sir Bors, by my counsel, unless that ye were disguised. Ye</a>
<a id='line_13869'>shall see me disguised, said Sir Gareth; and therewithal he espied a</a>
<a id='line_13870'>Welsh knight where he was to repose him, and he was sore hurt afore by</a>
<a id='line_13871'>Sir Gawaine, and to him Sir Gareth rode, and prayed him of his</a>
<a id='line_13872'>knighthood to lend him his shield for his. I will well, said the Welsh</a>
<a id='line_13873'>knight. And when Sir Gareth had his shield, the book saith it was</a>
<a id='line_13874'>green, with a maiden that seemed in it.</a>
<a id='line_13875'></a>
<a id='line_13876'>Then Sir Gareth came driving to Sir Launcelot all that he might and</a>
<a id='line_13877'>said: Knight, keep thyself, for yonder cometh King Arthur with nine</a>
<a id='line_13878'>noble knights with him to put you to a rebuke, and so I am come to bear</a>
<a id='line_13879'>you fellowship for old love ye have shewed me. Gramercy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13880'>Launcelot. Sir, said Sir Gareth, encounter ye with Sir Gawaine, and I</a>
<a id='line_13881'>shall encounter with Sir Palomides; and let Sir Lavaine match with the</a>
<a id='line_13882'>noble King Arthur. And when we have delivered them, let us three hold</a>
<a id='line_13883'>us sadly together. Then came King Arthur with his nine knights with</a>
<a id='line_13884'>him, and Sir Launcelot encountered with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such</a>
<a id='line_13885'>a buffet that the arson of his saddle brast, and Sir Gawaine fell to</a>
<a id='line_13886'>the earth. Then Sir Gareth encountered with the good knight Sir</a>
<a id='line_13887'>Palomides, and he gave him such a buffet that both his horse and he</a>
<a id='line_13888'>dashed to the earth. Then encountered King Arthur with Sir Lavaine, and</a>
<a id='line_13889'>there either of them smote other to the earth, horse and all, that they</a>
<a id='line_13890'>lay a great while. Then Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Agravaine, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13891'>Gaheris, and Sir Mordred; and Sir Gareth smote down Sir Kay, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_13892'>Safere, and Sir Griflet. And then Sir Lavaine was horsed again, and he</a>
<a id='line_13893'>smote down Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedevere and then there began</a>
<a id='line_13894'>great throng of good knights.</a>
<a id='line_13895'></a>
<a id='line_13896'>Then Sir Launcelot hurtled here and there, and raced and pulled off</a>
<a id='line_13897'>helms, so that at that time there might none sit him a buffet with</a>
<a id='line_13898'>spear nor with sword; and Sir Gareth did such deeds of arms that all</a>
<a id='line_13899'>men marvelled what knight he was with the green shield, for he smote</a>
<a id='line_13900'>down that day and pulled down mo than thirty knights. And, as the</a>
<a id='line_13901'>French book saith, Sir Launcelot marvelled; when he beheld Sir Gareth</a>
<a id='line_13902'>do such deeds, what knight he might be; and Sir Lavaine pulled down and</a>
<a id='line_13903'>smote down twenty knights. Also Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Gareth for</a>
<a id='line_13904'>an Sir Tristram de Liones, outher Sir Lamorak de Galis had been alive,</a>
<a id='line_13905'>Sir Launcelot would have deemed he had been one of them twain. So ever</a>
<a id='line_13906'>as Sir Launcelot Sir Gareth, Sir Lavaine fought, and on the one side</a>
<a id='line_13907'>Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Lionel, Sir Lamorak de Galis, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13908'>Bleoberis, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Pelleas, and with mo other</a>
<a id='line_13909'>of King Ban’s blood fought upon another party, and held the King with</a>
<a id='line_13910'>the Hundred Knights and the King of Northumberland right strait.</a>
<a id='line_13911'></a>

<a id='line_13914'></a>
<a id='line_13915'>CHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur marvelled much of the jousting in the</a>
<a id='line_13916'>field, and how he rode and found Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_13917'></a>
<a id='line_13918'></a>
<a id='line_13919'>So this tournament and this jousts dured long, till it was near night,</a>
<a id='line_13920'>for the knights of the Round Table relieved ever unto King Arthur; for</a>
<a id='line_13921'>the king was wroth out of measure that he and his knights might not</a>
<a id='line_13922'>prevail that day. Then Sir Gawaine said to the king: I marvel where all</a>
<a id='line_13923'>this day [be] Sir Bors de Ganis and his fellowship of Sir Launcelot’s</a>
<a id='line_13924'>blood, I marvel all this day they be not about you: it is for some</a>
<a id='line_13925'>cause said Sir Gawaine. By my head, said Sir Kay, Sir Bors is yonder</a>
<a id='line_13926'>all this day upon the right hand of this field, and there he and his</a>
<a id='line_13927'>blood do more worshipfully than we do. It may well be, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13928'>Gawaine, but I dread me ever of guile; for on pain of my life, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_13929'>Gawaine, this knight with the red sleeve of gold is himself Sir</a>
<a id='line_13930'>Launcelot, I see well by his riding and by his great strokes; and the</a>
<a id='line_13931'>other knight in the same colours is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine.</a>
<a id='line_13932'>Also that knight with the green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and</a>
<a id='line_13933'>yet he hath disguised himself, for no man shall never make him be</a>
<a id='line_13934'>against Sir Launcelot, because he made him knight. By my head, said</a>
<a id='line_13935'>Arthur, nephew, I believe you; therefore tell me now what is your best</a>
<a id='line_13936'>counsel. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall have my counsel: let blow unto</a>
<a id='line_13937'>lodging, for an he be Sir Launcelot du Lake, and my brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_13938'>Gareth, with him, with the help of that good young knight, Sir Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_13939'>trust me truly it will be no boot to strive with them but if we should</a>
<a id='line_13940'>fall ten or twelve upon one knight, and that were no worship, but</a>
<a id='line_13941'>shame. Ye say truth, said the king; and for to say sooth, said the</a>
<a id='line_13942'>king, it were shame to us so many as we be to set upon them any more;</a>
<a id='line_13943'>for wit ye well, said King Arthur, they be three good knights, and</a>
<a id='line_13944'>namely that knight with the sleeve of gold.</a>
<a id='line_13945'></a>
<a id='line_13946'>So then they blew unto lodging; but forthwithal King Arthur let send</a>
<a id='line_13947'>unto the four kings, and to the mighty duke, and prayed them that the</a>
<a id='line_13948'>knight with the sleeve of gold depart not from them, but that the king</a>
<a id='line_13949'>may speak with him. Then forthwithal King Arthur alighted and unarmed</a>
<a id='line_13950'>him, and took a little hackney and rode after Sir Launcelot, for ever</a>
<a id='line_13951'>he had a spy upon him. And so he found him among the four kings and the</a>
<a id='line_13952'>duke; and there the king prayed them all unto supper, and they said</a>
<a id='line_13953'>they would with good will. And when they were unarmed then King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_13954'>knew Sir Launcelot, Sir Lavaine, and Sir Gareth. Ah, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_13955'>said King Arthur, this day ye have heated me and my knights.</a>
<a id='line_13956'></a>
<a id='line_13957'>So they yede unto Arthur’s lodging all together, and there was a great</a>
<a id='line_13958'>feast and great revel, and the prize was given unto Sir Launcelot; and</a>
<a id='line_13959'>by heralds they named him that he had smitten down fifty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_13960'>Sir Gareth five-and-thirty, and Sir Lavaine four-and-twenty knights.</a>
<a id='line_13961'>Then Sir Launcelot told the king and the queen how the lady huntress</a>
<a id='line_13962'>shot him in the forest of Windsor, in the buttock, with an broad arrow,</a>
<a id='line_13963'>and how the wound thereof was that time six inches deep, and in like</a>
<a id='line_13964'>long. Also Arthur blamed Sir Gareth because he left his fellowship and</a>
<a id='line_13965'>held with Sir Launcelot. My lord, said Sir Gareth, he made me a knight,</a>
<a id='line_13966'>and when I saw him so hard bestead, methought it was my worship to help</a>
<a id='line_13967'>him, for I saw him do so much, and so many noble knights against him;</a>
<a id='line_13968'>and when I understood that he was Sir Launcelot du Lake, I shamed to</a>
<a id='line_13969'>see so many knights against him alone. Truly, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13970'>Gareth, ye say well, and worshipfully have ye done and to yourself</a>
<a id='line_13971'>great worship; and all the days of my life, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_13972'>Gareth, wit you well I shall love you, and trust you the more better.</a>
<a id='line_13973'>For ever, said Arthur, it is a worshipful knight’s deed to help another</a>
<a id='line_13974'>worshipful knight when he seeth him in a great danger; for ever a</a>
<a id='line_13975'>worshipful man will be loath to see a worshipful man shamed; and he</a>
<a id='line_13976'>that is of no worship, and fareth with cowardice, never shall he show</a>
<a id='line_13977'>gentleness, nor no manner of goodness where he seeth a man in any</a>
<a id='line_13978'>danger, for then ever will a coward show no mercy; and always a good</a>
<a id='line_13979'>man will do ever to another man as he would be done to himself. So then</a>
<a id='line_13980'>there were great feasts unto kings and dukes, and revel, game, and</a>
<a id='line_13981'>play, and all manner of noblesse was used; and he that was courteous,</a>
<a id='line_13982'>true, and faithful, to his friend was that time cherished.</a>

<a id='line_13988'></a>
<a id='line_13989'></a>
<a id='line_13990'>And thus it passed on from Candlemass until after Easter, that the</a>
<a id='line_13991'>month of May was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom, and</a>
<a id='line_13992'>to bring forth fruit; for like as herbs and trees bring forth fruit and</a>
<a id='line_13993'>flourish in May, in like wise every lusty heart that is in any manner a</a>
<a id='line_13994'>lover, springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds. For it giveth unto all</a>
<a id='line_13995'>lovers courage, that lusty month of May, in something to constrain him</a>
<a id='line_13996'>to some manner of thing more in that month than in any other month, for</a>
<a id='line_13997'>divers causes. For then all herbs and trees renew a man and woman, and</a>
<a id='line_13998'>likewise lovers call again to their mind old gentleness and old</a>
<a id='line_13999'>service, and many kind deeds that were forgotten by negligence. For</a>
<a id='line_14000'>like as winter rasure doth alway arase and deface green summer, so</a>
<a id='line_14001'>fareth it by unstable love in man and woman. For in many persons there</a>
<a id='line_14002'>is no stability; for we may see all day, for a little blast of winter’s</a>
<a id='line_14003'>rasure, anon we shall deface and lay apart true love for little or</a>
<a id='line_14004'>nought, that cost much thing; this is no wisdom nor stability, but it</a>
<a id='line_14005'>is feebleness of nature and great disworship, whosomever useth this.</a>
<a id='line_14006'>Therefore, like as May month flowereth and flourisheth in many gardens,</a>
<a id='line_14007'>so in like wise let every man of worship flourish his heart in this</a>
<a id='line_14008'>world, first unto God, and next unto the joy of them that he promised</a>
<a id='line_14009'>his faith unto; for there was never worshipful man or worshipful woman,</a>
<a id='line_14010'>but they loved one better than another; and worship in arms may never</a>
<a id='line_14011'>be foiled, but first reserve the honour to God, and secondly the</a>
<a id='line_14012'>quarrel must come of thy lady: and such love I call virtuous love.</a>
<a id='line_14013'></a>
<a id='line_14014'>But nowadays men can not love seven night but they must have all their</a>
<a id='line_14015'>desires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon</a>
<a id='line_14016'>accorded and hasty heat, soon it cooleth. Right so fareth love</a>
<a id='line_14017'>nowadays, soon hot soon cold: this is no stability. But the old love</a>
<a id='line_14018'>was not so; men and women could love together seven years, and no</a>
<a id='line_14019'>licours lusts were between them, and then was love, truth, and</a>
<a id='line_14020'>faithfulness: and lo, in like wise was used love in King Arthur’s days.</a>
<a id='line_14021'>Wherefore I liken love nowadays unto summer and winter; for like as the</a>
<a id='line_14022'>one is hot and the other cold, so fareth love nowadays; therefore all</a>
<a id='line_14023'>ye that be lovers call unto your remembrance the month of May, like as</a>
<a id='line_14024'>did Queen Guenever, for whom I make here a little mention, that while</a>
<a id='line_14025'>she lived she was a true lover, and therefore she had a good end.</a>

<a id='line_14039'></a>
<a id='line_14040'></a>
<a id='line_14041'>So it befell in the month of May, Queen Guenever called unto her</a>
<a id='line_14042'>knights of the Table Round; and she gave them warning that early upon</a>
<a id='line_14043'>the morrow she would ride a-Maying into woods and fields beside</a>
<a id='line_14044'>Westminster. And I warn you that there be none of you but that he be</a>
<a id='line_14045'>well horsed, and that ye all be clothed in green, outher in silk outher</a>
<a id='line_14046'>in cloth; and I shall bring with me ten ladies, and every knight shall</a>
<a id='line_14047'>have a lady behind him, and every knight shall have a squire and two</a>
<a id='line_14048'>yeomen; and I will that ye all be well horsed. So they made them ready</a>
<a id='line_14049'>in the freshest manner. And these were the names of the knights: Sir</a>
<a id='line_14050'>Kay le Seneschal, Sir Agravaine, Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore le</a>
<a id='line_14051'>Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir Ozanna le Cure Hardy, Sir Ladinas</a>
<a id='line_14052'>of the Forest Savage, Sir Persant of Inde, Sir Ironside, that was</a>
<a id='line_14053'>called the Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Pelleas, the lover; and</a>
<a id='line_14054'>these ten knights made them ready in the freshest manner to ride with</a>
<a id='line_14055'>the queen. And so upon the morn they took their horses with the queen,</a>
<a id='line_14056'>and rode a-Maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them, in great joy</a>
<a id='line_14057'>and delights; for the queen had cast to have been again with King</a>
<a id='line_14058'>Arthur at the furthest by ten of the clock, and so was that time her</a>
<a id='line_14059'>purpose.</a>
<a id='line_14060'></a>
<a id='line_14061'>Then there was a knight that hight Meliagrance, and he was son unto</a>
<a id='line_14062'>King Bagdemagus, and this knight had at that time a castle of the gift</a>
<a id='line_14063'>of King Arthur within seven mile of Westminster. And this knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14064'>Meliagrance, loved passing well Queen Guenever, and so had he done long</a>
<a id='line_14065'>and many years. And the book saith he had lain in await for to steal</a>
<a id='line_14066'>away the queen, but evermore he forbare for because of Sir Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_14067'>for in no wise he would meddle with the queen an Sir Launcelot were in</a>
<a id='line_14068'>her company, outher else an he were near-hand her. And that time was</a>
<a id='line_14069'>such a custom, the queen rode never without a great fellowship of men</a>
<a id='line_14070'>of arms about her, and they were many good knights, and the most part</a>
<a id='line_14071'>were young men that would have worship; and they were called the</a>
<a id='line_14072'>Queen’s Knights, and never in no battle, tournament, nor jousts, they</a>
<a id='line_14073'>bare none of them no manner of knowledging of their own arms, but plain</a>
<a id='line_14074'>white shields, and thereby they were called the Queen’s Knights. And</a>
<a id='line_14075'>then when it happed any of them to be of great worship by his noble</a>
<a id='line_14076'>deeds, then at the next Feast of Pentecost, if there were any slain or</a>
<a id='line_14077'>dead, as there was none year that there failed but some were dead, then</a>
<a id='line_14078'>was there chosen in his stead that was dead the most men of worship,</a>
<a id='line_14079'>that were called the Queen’s Knights. And thus they came up all first,</a>
<a id='line_14080'>or they were renowned men of worship, both Sir Launcelot and all the</a>
<a id='line_14081'>remnant of them.</a>
<a id='line_14082'></a>
<a id='line_14083'>But this knight, Sir Meliagrance, had espied the queen well and her</a>
<a id='line_14084'>purpose, and how Sir Launcelot was not with her, and how she had no men</a>
<a id='line_14085'>of arms with her but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for</a>
<a id='line_14086'>Maying. Then he purveyed him a twenty men of arms and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_14087'>archers for to destroy the queen and her knights, for he thought that</a>
<a id='line_14088'>time was best season to take the queen.</a>

<a id='line_14093'>CHAPTER II. How Sir Meliagrance took the queen and her knights, which</a>
<a id='line_14094'>were sore hurt in fighting.</a>
<a id='line_14095'></a>
<a id='line_14096'></a>
<a id='line_14097'>So as the queen had Mayed and all her knights, all were bedashed with</a>
<a id='line_14098'>herbs, mosses and flowers, in the best manner and freshest. Right so</a>
<a id='line_14099'>came out of a wood Sir Meliagrance with an eight score men well</a>
<a id='line_14100'>harnessed, as they should fight in a battle of arrest, and bade the</a>
<a id='line_14101'>queen and her knights abide, for maugre their heads they should abide.</a>
<a id='line_14102'>Traitor knight, said Queen Guenever, what cast thou for to do? Wilt</a>
<a id='line_14103'>thou shame thyself? Bethink thee how thou art a king’s son, and knight</a>
<a id='line_14104'>of the Table Round, and thou to be about to dishonour the noble king</a>
<a id='line_14105'>that made thee knight; thou shamest all knighthood and thyself, and me,</a>
<a id='line_14106'>I let thee wit, shalt thou never shame, for I had liefer cut mine own</a>
<a id='line_14107'>throat in twain rather than thou shouldest dishonour me. As for all</a>
<a id='line_14108'>this language, said Sir Meliagrance, be it as it be may, for wit you</a>
<a id='line_14109'>well, madam, I have loved you many a year, and never or now could I get</a>
<a id='line_14110'>you at such an advantage as I do now, and therefore I will take you as</a>
<a id='line_14111'>I find you.</a>
<a id='line_14112'></a>
<a id='line_14113'>Then spake all the ten noble knights at once and said: Sir Meliagrance,</a>
<a id='line_14114'>wit thou well ye are about to jeopard your worship to dishonour, and</a>
<a id='line_14115'>also ye cast to jeopard our persons howbeit we be unarmed. Ye have us</a>
<a id='line_14116'>at a great avail, for it seemeth by you that ye have laid watch upon</a>
<a id='line_14117'>us; but rather than ye should put the queen to a shame and us all, we</a>
<a id='line_14118'>had as lief to depart from our lives, for an if we other ways did, we</a>
<a id='line_14119'>were shamed for ever. Then said Sir Meliagrance: Dress you as well ye</a>
<a id='line_14120'>can, and keep the queen. Then the ten knights of the Table Round drew</a>
<a id='line_14121'>their swords, and the other let run at them with their spears, and the</a>
<a id='line_14122'>ten knights manly abode them, and smote away their spears that no spear</a>
<a id='line_14123'>did them none harm. Then they lashed together with swords, and anon Sir</a>
<a id='line_14124'>Kay, Sir Sagramore, Sir Agravaine, Sir Dodinas, Sir Ladinas, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14125'>Ozanna were smitten to the earth with grimly wounds. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14126'>Brandiles, and Sir Persant, Sir Ironside, Sir Pelleas fought long, and</a>
<a id='line_14127'>they were sore wounded, for these ten knights, or ever they were laid</a>
<a id='line_14128'>to the ground, slew forty men of the boldest and the best of them.</a>
<a id='line_14129'></a>
<a id='line_14130'>So when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully wounded, and needs</a>
<a id='line_14131'>must be slain at the last, then for pity and sorrow she cried Sir</a>
<a id='line_14132'>Meliagrance: Slay not my noble knights, and I will go with thee upon</a>
<a id='line_14133'>this covenant, that thou save them, and suffer them not to be no more</a>
<a id='line_14134'>hurt, with this, that they be led with me wheresomever thou leadest me,</a>
<a id='line_14135'>for I will rather slay myself than I will go with thee, unless that</a>
<a id='line_14136'>these my noble knights may be in my presence. Madam, said Meliagrance,</a>
<a id='line_14137'>for your sake they shall be led with you into mine own castle, with</a>
<a id='line_14138'>that ye will be ruled, and ride with me. Then the queen prayed the four</a>
<a id='line_14139'>knights to leave their fighting, and she and they would not depart.</a>
<a id='line_14140'>Madam, said Sir Pelleas, we will do as ye do, for as for me I take no</a>
<a id='line_14141'>force of my life nor death. For as the French book saith, Sir Pelleas</a>
<a id='line_14142'>gave such buffets there that none armour might hold him.</a>
<a id='line_14143'></a>
<a id='line_14144'></a>
<a id='line_14145'></a>
<a id='line_14146'></a>
<a id='line_14147'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot had word how the queen was taken, and</a>
<a id='line_14148'>how Sir Meliagrance laid a bushment for Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_14149'></a>
<a id='line_14150'></a>
<a id='line_14151'>Then by the queen’s commandment they left battle, and dressed the</a>
<a id='line_14152'>wounded knights on horseback, some sitting, some overthwart their</a>
<a id='line_14153'>horses, that it was pity to behold them. And then Sir Meliagrance</a>
<a id='line_14154'>charged the queen and all her knights that none of all her fellowship</a>
<a id='line_14155'>should depart from her; for full sore he dread Sir Launcelot du Lake,</a>
<a id='line_14156'>lest he should have any knowledging. All this espied the queen, and</a>
<a id='line_14157'>privily she called unto her a child of her chamber that was swiftly</a>
<a id='line_14158'>horsed, to whom she said: Go thou, when thou seest thy time, and bear</a>
<a id='line_14159'>this ring unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and pray him as he loveth me that</a>
<a id='line_14160'>he will see me and rescue me, if ever he will have joy of me; and spare</a>
<a id='line_14161'>not thy horse, said the queen, neither for water, neither for land. So</a>
<a id='line_14162'>the child espied his time, and lightly he took his horse with the</a>
<a id='line_14163'>spurs, and departed as fast as he might. And when Sir Meliagrance saw</a>
<a id='line_14164'>him so flee, he understood that it was by the queen’s commandment for</a>
<a id='line_14165'>to warn Sir Launcelot. Then they that were best horsed chased him and</a>
<a id='line_14166'>shot at him, but from them all the child went suddenly. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14167'>Meliagrance said to the queen: Madam, ye are about to betray me, but I</a>
<a id='line_14168'>shall ordain for Sir Launcelot that he shall not come lightly at you.</a>
<a id='line_14169'>And then he rode with her, and they all, to his castle, in all the</a>
<a id='line_14170'>haste that they might. And by the way Sir Meliagrance laid in an</a>
<a id='line_14171'>embushment the best archers that he might get in his country, to the</a>
<a id='line_14172'>number of thirty, to await upon Sir Launcelot, charging them that if</a>
<a id='line_14173'>they saw such a manner of knight come by the way upon a white horse,</a>
<a id='line_14174'>that in any wise they slay his horse, but in no manner of wise have not</a>
<a id='line_14175'>ado with him bodily, for he is over-hardy to be overcome.</a>
<a id='line_14176'></a>
<a id='line_14177'>So this was done, and they were come to his castle, but in no wise the</a>
<a id='line_14178'>queen would never let none of the ten knights and her ladies out of her</a>
<a id='line_14179'>sight, but always they were in her presence; for the book saith, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14180'>Meliagrance durst make no masteries, for dread of Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14181'>insomuch he deemed that he had warning. So when the child was departed</a>
<a id='line_14182'>from the fellowship of Sir Meliagrance, within a while he came to</a>
<a id='line_14183'>Westminster, and anon he found Sir Launcelot. And when he had told his</a>
<a id='line_14184'>message, and delivered him the queen’s ring: Alas, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14185'>now I am shamed for ever, unless that I may rescue that noble lady from</a>
<a id='line_14186'>dishonour. Then eagerly he asked his armour; and ever the child told</a>
<a id='line_14187'>Sir Launcelot how the ten knights fought marvellously, and how Sir</a>
<a id='line_14188'>Pelleas, and Sir Ironside, and Sir Brandiles, and Sir Persant of Inde,</a>
<a id='line_14189'>fought strongly, but namely Sir Pelleas, there might none withstand</a>
<a id='line_14190'>him; and how they all fought till at the last they were laid to the</a>
<a id='line_14191'>earth; and then the queen made appointment for to save their lives, and</a>
<a id='line_14192'>go with Sir Meliagrance.</a>
<a id='line_14193'></a>
<a id='line_14194'>Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that most noble lady, that she should be so</a>
<a id='line_14195'>destroyed; I had liefer, said Sir Launcelot, than all France, that I</a>
<a id='line_14196'>had been there well armed. So when Sir Launcelot was armed and upon his</a>
<a id='line_14197'>horse, he prayed the child of the queen’s chamber to warn Sir Lavaine</a>
<a id='line_14198'>how suddenly he was departed, and for what cause. And pray him as he</a>
<a id='line_14199'>loveth me, that he will hie him after me, and that he stint not until</a>
<a id='line_14200'>he come to the castle where Sir Meliagrance abideth, or dwelleth; for</a>
<a id='line_14201'>there, said Sir Launcelot, he shall hear of me an I am a man living,</a>
<a id='line_14202'>and rescue the queen and the ten knights the which he traitorously hath</a>
<a id='line_14203'>taken, and that shall I prove upon his head, and all them that hold</a>
<a id='line_14204'>with him.</a>

<a id='line_14209'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot’s horse was slain, and how Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14210'>rode in a cart for to rescue the queen.</a>
<a id='line_14211'></a>
<a id='line_14212'></a>
<a id='line_14213'>Then Sir Launcelot rode as fast as he might, and the book saith he took</a>
<a id='line_14214'>the water at Westminster Bridge, and made his horse to swim over Thames</a>
<a id='line_14215'>unto Lambeth. And then within a while he came to the same place thereas</a>
<a id='line_14216'>the ten noble knights fought with Sir Meliagrance. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_14217'>Launcelot followed the track until that he came to a wood, and there</a>
<a id='line_14218'>was a straight way, and there the thirty archers bade Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14219'>turn again, and follow no longer that track. What commandment have ye</a>
<a id='line_14220'>thereto, said Sir Launcelot, to cause me that am a knight of the Round</a>
<a id='line_14221'>Table to leave my right way? This way shalt thou leave, other-else thou</a>
<a id='line_14222'>shalt go it on thy foot, for wit thou well thy horse shall be slain.</a>
<a id='line_14223'>That is little mastery, said Sir Launcelot, to slay mine horse; but as</a>
<a id='line_14224'>for myself, when my horse is slain, I give right nought for you, not an</a>
<a id='line_14225'>ye were five hundred more. So then they shot Sir Launcelot’s horse, and</a>
<a id='line_14226'>smote him with many arrows; and then Sir Launcelot avoided his horse,</a>
<a id='line_14227'>and went on foot; but there were so many ditches and hedges betwixt</a>
<a id='line_14228'>them and him that he might not meddle with none of them. Alas for</a>
<a id='line_14229'>shame, said Launcelot, that ever one knight should betray another</a>
<a id='line_14230'>knight; but it is an old saw, A good man is never in danger but when he</a>
<a id='line_14231'>is in the danger of a coward. Then Sir Launcelot went a while, and then</a>
<a id='line_14232'>he was foul cumbered of his armour, his shield, and his spear, and all</a>
<a id='line_14233'>that longed unto him. Wit ye well he was full sore annoyed, and full</a>
<a id='line_14234'>loath he was for to leave anything that longed unto him, for he dread</a>
<a id='line_14235'>sore the treason of Sir Meliagrance.</a>
<a id='line_14236'></a>
<a id='line_14237'>Then by fortune there came by him a chariot that came thither for to</a>
<a id='line_14238'>fetch wood. Say me, carter, said Sir Launcelot, what shall I give thee</a>
<a id='line_14239'>to suffer me to leap into thy chariot, and that thou bring me unto a</a>
<a id='line_14240'>castle within this two mile? Thou shalt not come within my chariot,</a>
<a id='line_14241'>said the carter, for I am sent for to fetch wood for my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14242'>Meliagrance. With him would I speak. Thou shalt not go with me, said</a>
<a id='line_14243'>the carter. Then Sir Launcelot leapt to him, and gave him such a buffet</a>
<a id='line_14244'>that he fell to the earth stark dead. Then the other carter, his</a>
<a id='line_14245'>fellow, was afeard, and weened to have gone the same way; and then he</a>
<a id='line_14246'>cried: Fair lord, save my life, and I shall bring you where ye will.</a>
<a id='line_14247'>Then I charge thee, said Sir Launcelot, that thou drive me and this</a>
<a id='line_14248'>chariot even unto Sir Meliagrance’s gate. Leap up into the chariot,</a>
<a id='line_14249'>said the carter, and ye shall be there anon. So the carter drove on a</a>
<a id='line_14250'>great wallop, and Sir Launcelot’s horse followed the chariot, with more</a>
<a id='line_14251'>than a forty arrows broad and rough in him.</a>
<a id='line_14252'></a>
<a id='line_14253'>And more than an hour and an half Dame Guenever was awaiting in a bay</a>
<a id='line_14254'>window with her ladies, and espied an armed knight standing in a</a>
<a id='line_14255'>chariot. See, madam, said a lady, where rideth in a chariot a goodly</a>
<a id='line_14256'>armed knight; I suppose he rideth unto hanging. Where? said the queen.</a>
<a id='line_14257'>Then she espied by his shield that he was there himself, Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14258'>du Lake. And then she was ware where came his horse ever after that</a>
<a id='line_14259'>chariot, and ever he trod his guts and his paunch under his feet. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_14260'>said the queen, now I see well and prove, that well is him that hath a</a>
<a id='line_14261'>trusty friend. Ha, ha, most noble knight, said Queen Guenever, I see</a>
<a id='line_14262'>well thou art hard bestead when thou ridest in a chariot. Then she</a>
<a id='line_14263'>rebuked that lady that likened Sir Launcelot to ride in a chariot to</a>
<a id='line_14264'>hanging. It was foul mouthed, said the queen, and evil likened, so for</a>
<a id='line_14265'>to liken the most noble knight of the world unto such a shameful death.</a>
<a id='line_14266'>O Jesu defend him and keep him, said the queen, from all mischievous</a>
<a id='line_14267'>end. By this was Sir Launcelot come to the gates of that castle, and</a>
<a id='line_14268'>there he descended down, and cried, that all the castle rang of it:</a>
<a id='line_14269'>Where art thou, false traitor, Sir Meliagrance, and knight of the Table</a>
<a id='line_14270'>Round? now come forth here, thou traitor knight, thou and thy</a>
<a id='line_14271'>fellowship with thee; for here I am, Sir Launcelot du Lake, that shall</a>
<a id='line_14272'>fight with you. And therewithal he bare the gate wide open upon the</a>
<a id='line_14273'>porter, and smote him under his ear with his gauntlet, that his neck</a>
<a id='line_14274'>brast a-sunder.</a>
<a id='line_14275'></a>
<a id='line_14276'></a>
<a id='line_14277'></a>
<a id='line_14278'></a>
<a id='line_14279'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Meliagrance required forgiveness of the queen, and</a>
<a id='line_14280'>how she appeased Sir Launcelot; and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_14281'></a>
<a id='line_14282'></a>
<a id='line_14283'>When Sir Meliagrance heard that Sir Launcelot was there he ran unto</a>
<a id='line_14284'>Queen Guenever, and fell upon his knee, and said: Mercy, madam, now I</a>
<a id='line_14285'>put me wholly into your grace. What aileth you now? said Queen</a>
<a id='line_14286'>Guenever; forsooth I might well wit some good knight would revenge me,</a>
<a id='line_14287'>though my lord Arthur wist not of this your work. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14288'>Meliagrance, all this that is amiss on my part shall be amended right</a>
<a id='line_14289'>as yourself will devise, and wholly I put me in your grace. What would</a>
<a id='line_14290'>ye that I did? said the queen. I would no more, said Meliagrance, but</a>
<a id='line_14291'>that ye would take all in your own hands, and that ye will rule my lord</a>
<a id='line_14292'>Sir Launcelot; and such cheer as may be made him in this poor castle ye</a>
<a id='line_14293'>and he shall have until to-morn, and then may ye and all they return</a>
<a id='line_14294'>unto Westminster; and my body and all that I have I shall put in your</a>
<a id='line_14295'>rule. Ye say well, said the queen, and better is peace than ever war,</a>
<a id='line_14296'>and the less noise the more is my worship.</a>
<a id='line_14297'></a>
<a id='line_14298'>Then the queen and her ladies went down unto the knight, Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14299'>that stood wroth out of measure in the inner court, to abide battle;</a>
<a id='line_14300'>and ever he bade: Thou traitor knight come forth. Then the queen came</a>
<a id='line_14301'>to him and said: Sir Launcelot, why be ye so moved? Ha, madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14302'>Launcelot, why ask ye me that question? Meseemeth, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14303'>ye ought to be more wroth than I am, for ye have the hurt and the</a>
<a id='line_14304'>dishonour, for wit ye well, madam, my hurt is but little for the</a>
<a id='line_14305'>killing of a mare’s son, but the despite grieveth me much more than all</a>
<a id='line_14306'>my hurt. Truly, said the queen, ye say truth; but heartily I thank you,</a>
<a id='line_14307'>said the queen, but ye must come in with me peaceably, for all thing is</a>
<a id='line_14308'>put in my hand, and all that is evil shall be for the best, for the</a>
<a id='line_14309'>knight full sore repenteth him of the misadventure that is befallen</a>
<a id='line_14310'>him. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, sith it is so that ye been accorded</a>
<a id='line_14311'>with him, as for me I may not be again it, howbeit Sir Meliagrance hath</a>
<a id='line_14312'>done full shamefully to me, and cowardly. Ah madam, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14313'>an I had wist ye would have been so soon accorded with him I would not</a>
<a id='line_14314'>have made such haste unto you. Why say ye so, said the queen, do ye</a>
<a id='line_14315'>forthink yourself of your good deeds? Wit you well, said the queen, I</a>
<a id='line_14316'>accorded never unto him for favour nor love that I had unto him, but</a>
<a id='line_14317'>for to lay down every shameful noise. Madam, said Sir Launcelot, ye</a>
<a id='line_14318'>understand full well I was never willing nor glad of shameful slander</a>
<a id='line_14319'>nor noise; and there is neither king, queen, nor knight, that beareth</a>
<a id='line_14320'>the life, except my lord King Arthur, and you, madam, should let me,</a>
<a id='line_14321'>but I should make Sir Meliagrance’s heart full cold or ever I departed</a>
<a id='line_14322'>from hence. That wot I well, said the queen, but what will ye more? Ye</a>
<a id='line_14323'>shall have all thing ruled as ye list to have it. Madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14324'>Launcelot, so ye be pleased I care not, as for my part ye shall soon</a>
<a id='line_14325'>please.</a>
<a id='line_14326'></a>
<a id='line_14327'>Right so the queen took Sir Launcelot by the bare hand, for he had put</a>
<a id='line_14328'>off his gauntlet, and so she went with him till her chamber; and then</a>
<a id='line_14329'>she commanded him to be unarmed. And then Sir Launcelot asked where</a>
<a id='line_14330'>were the ten knights that were wounded sore; so she showed them unto</a>
<a id='line_14331'>Sir Launcelot, and there they made great joy of the coming of him, and</a>
<a id='line_14332'>Sir Launcelot made great dole of their hurts, and bewailed them</a>
<a id='line_14333'>greatly. And there Sir Launcelot told them how cowardly and traitorly</a>
<a id='line_14334'>Meliagrance set archers to slay his horse, and how he was fain to put</a>
<a id='line_14335'>himself in a chariot. Thus they complained everych to other; and full</a>
<a id='line_14336'>fain they would have been revenged, but they peaced themselves because</a>
<a id='line_14337'>of the queen. Then, as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot was called</a>
<a id='line_14338'>many a day after le Chevaler du Chariot, and did many deeds, and great</a>
<a id='line_14339'>adventures he had. And so leave we of this tale le Chevaler du Chariot,</a>
<a id='line_14340'>and turn we to this tale.</a>
<a id='line_14341'></a>
<a id='line_14342'>So Sir Launcelot had great cheer with the queen, and then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14343'>made a promise with the queen that the same night Sir Launcelot should</a>
<a id='line_14344'>come to a window outward toward a garden; and that window was y-barred</a>
<a id='line_14345'>with iron, and there Sir Launcelot promised to meet her when all folks</a>
<a id='line_14346'>were asleep. So then came Sir Lavaine driving to the gates, crying:</a>
<a id='line_14347'>Where is my lord, Sir Launcelot du Lake? Then was he sent for, and when</a>
<a id='line_14348'>Sir Lavaine saw Sir Launcelot, he said: My lord, I found well how ye</a>
<a id='line_14349'>were hard bestead, for I have found your horse that was slain with</a>
<a id='line_14350'>arrows. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, I pray you, Sir Lavaine, speak</a>
<a id='line_14351'>ye of other matters, and let ye this pass, and we shall right it</a>
<a id='line_14352'>another time when we best may.</a>
<a id='line_14353'></a>
<a id='line_14354'></a>
<a id='line_14355'></a>
<a id='line_14356'></a>
<a id='line_14357'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot came in the night to the queen and lay</a>
<a id='line_14358'>with her, and how Sir Meliagrance appeached the queen of treason.</a>
<a id='line_14359'></a>
<a id='line_14360'></a>
<a id='line_14361'>Then the knights that were hurt were searched, and soft salves were</a>
<a id='line_14362'>laid to their wounds; and so it passed on till supper time, and all the</a>
<a id='line_14363'>cheer that might be made them there was done unto the queen and all her</a>
<a id='line_14364'>knights. Then when season was, they went unto their chambers, but in no</a>
<a id='line_14365'>wise the queen would not suffer the wounded knights to be from her, but</a>
<a id='line_14366'>that they were laid within draughts by her chamber, upon beds and</a>
<a id='line_14367'>pillows, that she herself might see to them, that they wanted nothing.</a>
<a id='line_14368'></a>
<a id='line_14369'>So when Sir Launcelot was in his chamber that was assigned unto him, he</a>
<a id='line_14370'>called unto him Sir Lavaine, and told him that night he must go speak</a>
<a id='line_14371'>with his lady, Dame Guenever. Sir, said Sir Lavaine, let me go with you</a>
<a id='line_14372'>an it please you, for I dread me sore of the treason of Sir</a>
<a id='line_14373'>Meliagrance. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you, but I will have</a>
<a id='line_14374'>nobody with me. Then Sir Launcelot took his sword in his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_14375'>privily went to a place where he had espied a ladder to-forehand, and</a>
<a id='line_14376'>that he took under his arm, and bare it through the garden, and set it</a>
<a id='line_14377'>up to the window, and there anon the queen was ready to meet him. And</a>
<a id='line_14378'>then they made either to other their complaints of many divers things,</a>
<a id='line_14379'>and then Sir Launcelot wished that he might have come into her. Wit ye</a>
<a id='line_14380'>well, said the queen, I would as fain as ye, that ye might come in to</a>
<a id='line_14381'>me. Would ye, madam, said Sir Launcelot, with your heart that I were</a>
<a id='line_14382'>with you? Yea, truly, said the queen. Now shall I prove my might, said</a>
<a id='line_14383'>Sir Launcelot, for your love; and then he set his hands upon the bars</a>
<a id='line_14384'>of iron, and he pulled at them with such a might that he brast them</a>
<a id='line_14385'>clean out of the stone walls, and therewithal one of the bars of iron</a>
<a id='line_14386'>cut the brawn of his hands throughout to the bone; and then he leapt</a>
<a id='line_14387'>into the chamber to the queen. Make ye no noise, said the queen, for my</a>
<a id='line_14388'>wounded knights lie here fast by me. So, to pass upon this tale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14389'>Launcelot went unto bed with the queen, and he took no force of his</a>
<a id='line_14390'>hurt hand, but took his pleasaunce and his liking until it was in the</a>
<a id='line_14391'>dawning of the day; and wit ye well he slept not but watched, and when</a>
<a id='line_14392'>he saw his time that he might tarry no longer he took his leave and</a>
<a id='line_14393'>departed at the window, and put it together as well as he might again,</a>
<a id='line_14394'>and so departed unto his own chamber; and there he told Sir Lavaine how</a>
<a id='line_14395'>he was hurt. Then Sir Lavaine dressed his hand and staunched it, and</a>
<a id='line_14396'>put upon it a glove, that it should not be espied; and so the queen lay</a>
<a id='line_14397'>long in her bed until it was nine of the clock.</a>
<a id='line_14398'></a>
<a id='line_14399'>Then Sir Meliagrance went to the queen’s chamber, and found her ladies</a>
<a id='line_14400'>there ready clothed. Jesu mercy, said Sir Meliagrance, what aileth you,</a>
<a id='line_14401'>madam, that ye sleep thus long? And right therewithal he opened the</a>
<a id='line_14402'>curtain for to behold her; and then was he ware where she lay, and all</a>
<a id='line_14403'>the sheet and pillow was bebled with the blood of Sir Launcelot and of</a>
<a id='line_14404'>his hurt hand. When Sir Meliagrance espied that blood, then he deemed</a>
<a id='line_14405'>in her that she was false to the king, and that some of the wounded</a>
<a id='line_14406'>knights had lain by her all that night. Ah, madam, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14407'>Meliagrance, now I have found you a false traitress unto my lord</a>
<a id='line_14408'>Arthur; for now I prove well it was not for nought that ye laid these</a>
<a id='line_14409'>wounded knights within the bounds of your chamber; therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_14410'>call you of treason before my lord, King Arthur. And now I have proved</a>
<a id='line_14411'>you, madam, with a shameful deed; and that they be all false, or some</a>
<a id='line_14412'>of them, I will make good, for a wounded knight this night hath lain by</a>
<a id='line_14413'>you. That is false, said the queen, and that I will report me unto them</a>
<a id='line_14414'>all. Then when the ten knights heard Sir Meliagrance’s words, they</a>
<a id='line_14415'>spake all in one voice and said to Sir Meliagrance: Thou sayest</a>
<a id='line_14416'>falsely, and wrongfully puttest upon us such a deed, and that we will</a>
<a id='line_14417'>make good any of us; choose which thou list of us when we are whole of</a>
<a id='line_14418'>our wounds. Ye shall not, said Sir Meliagrance, away with your proud</a>
<a id='line_14419'>language, for here ye may all see, said Sir Meliagrance, that by the</a>
<a id='line_14420'>queen this night a wounded knight hath lain. Then were they all ashamed</a>
<a id='line_14421'>when they saw that blood; and wit you well Sir Meliagrance was passing</a>
<a id='line_14422'>glad that he had the queen at such an advantage, for he deemed by that</a>
<a id='line_14423'>to hide his treason. So with this rumour came in Sir Launcelot, and</a>
<a id='line_14424'>found them all at a great array.</a>
<a id='line_14425'></a>
<a id='line_14426'></a>
<a id='line_14427'></a>
<a id='line_14428'></a>
<a id='line_14429'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot answered for the queen, and waged battle</a>
<a id='line_14430'>against Sir Meliagrance; and how Sir Launcelot was taken in a trap.</a>
<a id='line_14431'></a>
<a id='line_14432'></a>
<a id='line_14433'>What array is this? said Sir Launcelot. Then Sir Meliagrance told them</a>
<a id='line_14434'>what he had found, and showed them the queen’s bed. Truly, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14435'>Launcelot, ye did not your part nor knightly, to touch a queen’s bed</a>
<a id='line_14436'>while it was drawn, and she lying therein; for I dare say my lord</a>
<a id='line_14437'>Arthur himself would not have displayed her curtains, she being within</a>
<a id='line_14438'>her bed, unless that it had pleased him to have lain down by her; and</a>
<a id='line_14439'>therefore ye have done unworshipfully and shamefully to yourself. I wot</a>
<a id='line_14440'>not what ye mean, said Sir Meliagrance, but well I am sure there hath</a>
<a id='line_14441'>one of her wounded knights lain by her this night, and therefore I will</a>
<a id='line_14442'>prove with my hands that she is a traitress unto my lord Arthur. Beware</a>
<a id='line_14443'>what ye do, said Launcelot, for an ye say so, an ye will prove it, it</a>
<a id='line_14444'>will be taken at your hands.</a>
<a id='line_14445'></a>
<a id='line_14446'>My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Sir Meliagrance, I rede you beware what ye</a>
<a id='line_14447'>do; for though ye are never so good a knight, as ye wot well ye are</a>
<a id='line_14448'>renowned the best knight of the world, yet should ye be advised to do</a>
<a id='line_14449'>battle in a wrong quarrel, for God will have a stroke in every battle.</a>
<a id='line_14450'>As for that, said Sir Launcelot, God is to be dread; but as to that I</a>
<a id='line_14451'>say nay plainly, that this night there lay none of these ten wounded</a>
<a id='line_14452'>knights with my lady Queen Guenever, and that will I prove with my</a>
<a id='line_14453'>hands, that ye say untruly in that now. Hold, said Sir Meliagrance,</a>
<a id='line_14454'>here is my glove that she is traitress unto my lord, King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_14455'>that this night one of the wounded knights lay with her. And I receive</a>
<a id='line_14456'>your glove, said Sir Launcelot. And so they were sealed with their</a>
<a id='line_14457'>signets, and delivered unto the ten knights. At what day shall we do</a>
<a id='line_14458'>battle together? said Sir Launcelot. This day eight days, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14459'>Meliagrance, in the field beside Westminster. I am agreed, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14460'>Launcelot. But now, said Sir Meliagrance, sithen it is so that we must</a>
<a id='line_14461'>fight together, I pray you, as ye be a noble knight, await me with no</a>
<a id='line_14462'>treason, nor none villainy the meanwhile, nor none for you. So God me</a>
<a id='line_14463'>help, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall right well wit I was never of no</a>
<a id='line_14464'>such conditions, for I report me to all knights that ever have known</a>
<a id='line_14465'>me, I fared never with no treason, nor I loved never the fellowship of</a>
<a id='line_14466'>no man that fared with treason. Then let us go to dinner, said</a>
<a id='line_14467'>Meliagrance, and after dinner ye and the queen and ye may ride all to</a>
<a id='line_14468'>Westminster. I will well, said Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_14469'></a>
<a id='line_14470'>Then Sir Meliagrance said to Sir Launcelot: Pleaseth it you to see the</a>
<a id='line_14471'>estures of this castle? With a good will, said Sir Launcelot. And then</a>
<a id='line_14472'>they went together from chamber to chamber, for Sir Launcelot dread no</a>
<a id='line_14473'>perils; for ever a man of worship and of prowess dreadeth least always</a>
<a id='line_14474'>perils, for they ween every man be as they be; but ever he that fareth</a>
<a id='line_14475'>with treason putteth oft a man in great danger. So it befell upon Sir</a>
<a id='line_14476'>Launcelot that no peril dread, as he went with Sir Meliagrance he trod</a>
<a id='line_14477'>on a trap and the board rolled, and there Sir Launcelot fell down more</a>
<a id='line_14478'>than ten fathom into a cave full of straw; and then Sir Meliagrance</a>
<a id='line_14479'>departed and made no fare as that he nist where he was.</a>
<a id='line_14480'></a>
<a id='line_14481'>And when Sir Launcelot was thus missed they marvelled where he was</a>
<a id='line_14482'>become; and then the queen and many of them deemed that he was departed</a>
<a id='line_14483'>as he was wont to do suddenly. For Sir Meliagrance made suddenly to put</a>
<a id='line_14484'>away aside Sir Lavaine’s horse, that they might all understand that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14485'>Launcelot was departed suddenly. So it passed on till after dinner; and</a>
<a id='line_14486'>then Sir Lavaine would not stint until that he ordained litters for the</a>
<a id='line_14487'>wounded knights, that they might be laid in them; and so with the queen</a>
<a id='line_14488'>and them all, both ladies and gentlewomen and other, went unto</a>
<a id='line_14489'>Westminster; and there the knights told King Arthur how Meliagrance had</a>
<a id='line_14490'>appealed the queen of high treason, and how Sir Launcelot had received</a>
<a id='line_14491'>the glove of him: And this day eight days they shall do battle afore</a>
<a id='line_14492'>you. By my head, said King Arthur, I am afeard Sir Meliagrance hath</a>
<a id='line_14493'>taken upon him a great charge; but where is Sir Launcelot? said the</a>
<a id='line_14494'>king. Sir, said they all, we wot not where he is, but we deem he is</a>
<a id='line_14495'>ridden to some adventures, as he is ofttimes wont to do, for he hath</a>
<a id='line_14496'>Sir Lavaine’s horse. Let him be, said the king, he will be founden, but</a>
<a id='line_14497'>if he be trapped with some treason.</a>
<a id='line_14498'></a>
<a id='line_14499'></a>
<a id='line_14500'></a>
<a id='line_14501'></a>
<a id='line_14502'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot was delivered out of prison by a lady,</a>
<a id='line_14503'>and took a white courser and came for to keep his day.</a>
<a id='line_14504'></a>
<a id='line_14505'></a>
<a id='line_14506'>So leave we Sir Launcelot lying within that cave in great pain; and</a>
<a id='line_14507'>every day there came a lady and brought him his meat and his drink, and</a>
<a id='line_14508'>wooed him, to have lain by him; and ever the noble knight, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14509'>Launcelot, said her nay. Sir Launcelot, said she, ye are not wise, for</a>
<a id='line_14510'>ye may never out of this prison, but if ye have my help; and also your</a>
<a id='line_14511'>lady, Queen Guenever, shall be brent in your default, unless that ye be</a>
<a id='line_14512'>there at the day of battle. God defend, said Sir Launcelot, that she</a>
<a id='line_14513'>should be brent in my default; and if it be so, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14514'>that I may not be there, it shall be well understanded, both at the</a>
<a id='line_14515'>king and at the queen, and with all men of worship, that I am dead,</a>
<a id='line_14516'>sick, outher in prison. For all men that know me will say for me that I</a>
<a id='line_14517'>am in some evil case an I be not there that day; and well I wot there</a>
<a id='line_14518'>is some good knight either of my blood, or some other that loveth me,</a>
<a id='line_14519'>that will take my quarrel in hand; and therefore, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_14520'>wit ye well ye shall not fear me; and if there were no more women in</a>
<a id='line_14521'>all this land but ye, I will not have ado with you. Then art thou</a>
<a id='line_14522'>shamed, said the lady, and destroyed for ever. As for world’s shame,</a>
<a id='line_14523'>Jesu defend me, and as for my distress, it is welcome whatsoever it be</a>
<a id='line_14524'>that God sendeth me.</a>
<a id='line_14525'></a>
<a id='line_14526'>So she came to him the same day that the battle should be, and said:</a>
<a id='line_14527'>Sir Launcelot, methinketh ye are too hard-hearted, but wouldest thou</a>
<a id='line_14528'>but kiss me once I should deliver thee, and thine armour, and the best</a>
<a id='line_14529'>horse that is within Sir Meliagrance’s stable. As for to kiss you, said</a>
<a id='line_14530'>Sir Launcelot, I may do that and lose no worship; and wit ye well an I</a>
<a id='line_14531'>understood there were any disworship for to kiss you I would not do it.</a>
<a id='line_14532'>Then he kissed her, and then she gat him, and brought him to his</a>
<a id='line_14533'>armour. And when he was armed, she brought him to a stable, where stood</a>
<a id='line_14534'>twelve good coursers, and bade him choose the best. Then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14535'>looked upon a white courser the which liked him best; and anon he</a>
<a id='line_14536'>commanded the keepers fast to saddle him with the best saddle of war</a>
<a id='line_14537'>that there was; and so it was done as he bade. Then gat he his spear in</a>
<a id='line_14538'>his hand, and his sword by his side, and commended the lady unto God,</a>
<a id='line_14539'>and said: Lady, for this good deed I shall do you service if ever it be</a>
<a id='line_14540'>in my power.</a>
<a id='line_14541'></a>
<a id='line_14542'></a>
<a id='line_14543'></a>
<a id='line_14544'></a>
<a id='line_14545'>CHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot came the same time that Sir Meliagrance</a>
<a id='line_14546'>abode him in the field and dressed him to battle.</a>
<a id='line_14547'></a>
<a id='line_14548'></a>
<a id='line_14549'>Now leave we Sir Launcelot wallop all that he might, and speak we of</a>
<a id='line_14550'>Queen Guenever that was brought to a fire to be brent; for Sir</a>
<a id='line_14551'>Meliagrance was sure, him thought, that Sir Launcelot should not be at</a>
<a id='line_14552'>that battle; therefore he ever cried upon King Arthur to do him</a>
<a id='line_14553'>justice, other-else bring forth Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then was the</a>
<a id='line_14554'>king and all the court full sore abashed and shamed that the queen</a>
<a id='line_14555'>should be brent in the default of Sir Launcelot. My lord Arthur, said</a>
<a id='line_14556'>Sir Lavaine, ye may understand that it is not well with my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_14557'>Launcelot, for an he were alive, so he be not sick outher in prison,</a>
<a id='line_14558'>wit ye well he would be here; for never heard ye that ever he failed</a>
<a id='line_14559'>his part for whom he should do battle for. And therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14560'>Lavaine, my lord, King Arthur, I beseech you give me license to do</a>
<a id='line_14561'>battle here this day for my lord and master, and for to save my lady,</a>
<a id='line_14562'>the queen. Gramercy gentle Sir Lavaine, said King Arthur, for I dare</a>
<a id='line_14563'>say all that Sir Meliagrance putteth upon my lady the queen is wrong,</a>
<a id='line_14564'>for I have spoken with all the ten wounded knights, and there is not</a>
<a id='line_14565'>one of them, an he were whole and able to do battle, but he would prove</a>
<a id='line_14566'>upon Sir Meliagrance’s body that it is false that he putteth upon my</a>
<a id='line_14567'>queen. So shall I, said Sir Lavaine, in the defence of my lord, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14568'>Launcelot, an ye will give me leave. Now I give you leave, said King</a>
<a id='line_14569'>Arthur, and do your best, for I dare well say there is some treason</a>
<a id='line_14570'>done to Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_14571'></a>
<a id='line_14572'>Then was Sir Lavaine armed and horsed, and suddenly at the lists’ end</a>
<a id='line_14573'>he rode to perform this battle; and right as the heralds should cry:</a>
<a id='line_14574'>Lesses les aler, right so came in Sir Launcelot driving with all the</a>
<a id='line_14575'>force of his horse. And then Arthur cried: Ho! and Abide! Then was Sir</a>
<a id='line_14576'>Launcelot called on horseback to-fore King Arthur, and there he told</a>
<a id='line_14577'>openly to-fore the king and all, how Sir Meliagrance had served him</a>
<a id='line_14578'>first to last. And when the king, and the queen, and all the lords,</a>
<a id='line_14579'>knew of the treason of Sir Meliagrance they were all ashamed on his</a>
<a id='line_14580'>behalf. Then was Queen Guenever sent for, and set by the king in great</a>
<a id='line_14581'>trust of her champion. And then there was no more else to say, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_14582'>Launcelot and Sir Meliagrance dressed them unto battle, and took their</a>
<a id='line_14583'>spears; and so they came together as thunder, and there Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14584'>bare him down quite over his horse’s croup. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14585'>alighted and dressed his shield on his shoulder, with his sword in his</a>
<a id='line_14586'>hand, and Sir Meliagrance in the same wise dressed him unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_14587'>there they smote many great strokes together; and at the last Sir</a>
<a id='line_14588'>Launcelot smote him such a buffet upon the helmet that he fell on the</a>
<a id='line_14589'>one side to the earth. And then he cried upon him aloud: Most noble</a>
<a id='line_14590'>knight, Sir Launcelot du Lake, save my life, for I yield me unto you,</a>
<a id='line_14591'>and I require you, as ye be a knight and fellow of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_14592'>slay me not, for I yield me as overcome; and whether I shall live or</a>
<a id='line_14593'>die I put me in the king’s hands and yours.</a>
<a id='line_14594'></a>
<a id='line_14595'>Then Sir Launcelot wist not what to do, for he had had liefer than all</a>
<a id='line_14596'>the good of the world he might have been revenged upon Sir Meliagrance;</a>
<a id='line_14597'>and Sir Launcelot looked up to the Queen Guenever, if he might espy by</a>
<a id='line_14598'>any sign or countenance what she would have done. And then the queen</a>
<a id='line_14599'>wagged her head upon Sir Launcelot, as though she would say: Slay him.</a>
<a id='line_14600'>Full well knew Sir Launcelot by the wagging of her head that she would</a>
<a id='line_14601'>have him dead; then Sir Launcelot bade him rise for shame and perform</a>
<a id='line_14602'>that battle to the utterance. Nay, said Sir Meliagrance, I will never</a>
<a id='line_14603'>arise until ye take me as yolden and recreant. I shall proffer you</a>
<a id='line_14604'>large proffers, said Sir Launcelot, that is for to say, I shall unarm</a>
<a id='line_14605'>my head and my left quarter of my body, all that may be unarmed, and</a>
<a id='line_14606'>let bind my left hand behind me, so that it shall not help me, and</a>
<a id='line_14607'>right so I shall do battle with you. Then Sir Meliagrance started up</a>
<a id='line_14608'>upon his legs, and said on high: My lord Arthur, take heed to this</a>
<a id='line_14609'>proffer, for I will take it, and let him be disarmed and bounden</a>
<a id='line_14610'>according to his proffer. What say ye, said King Arthur unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_14611'>Launcelot, will ye abide by your proffer? Yea, my lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14612'>Launcelot, I will never go from that I have once said.</a>
<a id='line_14613'></a>
<a id='line_14614'>Then the knights parters of the field disarmed Sir Launcelot, first his</a>
<a id='line_14615'>head, and sithen his left arm, and his left side, and they bound his</a>
<a id='line_14616'>left arm behind his back, without shield or anything, and then they</a>
<a id='line_14617'>were put together. Wit you well there was many a lady and knight</a>
<a id='line_14618'>marvelled that Sir Launcelot would jeopardy himself in such wise. Then</a>
<a id='line_14619'>Sir Meliagrance came with his sword all on high, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14620'>showed him openly his bare head and the bare left side; and when he</a>
<a id='line_14621'>weened to have smitten him upon the bare head, then lightly he avoided</a>
<a id='line_14622'>the left leg and the left side, and put his right hand and his sword to</a>
<a id='line_14623'>that stroke, and so put it on side with great sleight; and then with</a>
<a id='line_14624'>great force Sir Launcelot smote him on the helmet such a buffet that</a>
<a id='line_14625'>the stroke carved the head in two parts. Then there was no more to do,</a>
<a id='line_14626'>but he was drawn out of the field. And at the great instance of the</a>
<a id='line_14627'>knights of the Table Round, the king suffered him to be interred, and</a>
<a id='line_14628'>the mention made upon him, who slew him, and for what cause he was</a>
<a id='line_14629'>slain; and then the king and the queen made more of Sir Launcelot du</a>
<a id='line_14630'>Lake, and more he was cherished, than ever he was aforehand.</a>
<a id='line_14631'></a>

<a id='line_14634'></a>
<a id='line_14635'>CHAPTER X. How Sir Urre came into Arthur’s court for to be healed of</a>
<a id='line_14636'>his wounds, and how King Arthur would begin to handle him.</a>
<a id='line_14637'></a>
<a id='line_14638'></a>
<a id='line_14639'>Then as the French book maketh mention, there was a good knight in the</a>
<a id='line_14640'>land of Hungary, his name was Sir Urre, and he was an adventurous</a>
<a id='line_14641'>knight, and in all places where he might hear of any deeds of worship</a>
<a id='line_14642'>there would he be. So it happened in Spain there was an earl’s son, his</a>
<a id='line_14643'>name was Alphegus, and at a great tournament in Spain this Sir Urre,</a>
<a id='line_14644'>knight of Hungary, and Sir Alphegus of Spain encountered together for</a>
<a id='line_14645'>very envy; and so either undertook other to the utterance. And by</a>
<a id='line_14646'>fortune Sir Urre slew Sir Alphegus, the earl’s son of Spain, but this</a>
<a id='line_14647'>knight that was slain had given Sir Urre, or ever he was slain, seven</a>
<a id='line_14648'>great wounds, three on the head, and four on his body and upon his left</a>
<a id='line_14649'>hand. And this Sir Alphegus had a mother, the which was a great</a>
<a id='line_14650'>sorceress; and she, for the despite of her son’s death, wrought by her</a>
<a id='line_14651'>subtle crafts that Sir Urre should never be whole, but ever his wounds</a>
<a id='line_14652'>should one time fester and another time bleed, so that he should never</a>
<a id='line_14653'>be whole until the best knight of the world had searched his wounds;</a>
<a id='line_14654'>and thus she made her avaunt, wherethrough it was known that Sir Urre</a>
<a id='line_14655'>should never be whole.</a>
<a id='line_14656'></a>
<a id='line_14657'>Then his mother let make an horse litter, and put him therein under two</a>
<a id='line_14658'>palfreys; and then she took Sir Urre’s sister with him, a full fair</a>
<a id='line_14659'>damosel, whose name was Felelolie; and then she took a page with him to</a>
<a id='line_14660'>keep their horses, and so they led Sir Urre through many countries. For</a>
<a id='line_14661'>as the French book saith, she led him so seven year through all lands</a>
<a id='line_14662'>christened, and never she could find no knight that might ease her son.</a>
<a id='line_14663'>So she came into Scotland and into the lands of England, and by fortune</a>
<a id='line_14664'>she came nigh the feast of Pentecost until King Arthur’s court, that at</a>
<a id='line_14665'>that time was holden at Carlisle. And when she came there, then she</a>
<a id='line_14666'>made it openly to be known how that she was come into that land for to</a>
<a id='line_14667'>heal her son.</a>
<a id='line_14668'></a>
<a id='line_14669'>Then King Arthur let call that lady, and asked her the cause why she</a>
<a id='line_14670'>brought that hurt knight into that land. My most noble king, said that</a>
<a id='line_14671'>lady, wit you well I brought him hither for to be healed of his wounds,</a>
<a id='line_14672'>that of all this seven year he might not be whole. And then she told</a>
<a id='line_14673'>the king where he was wounded, and of whom; and how his mother had</a>
<a id='line_14674'>discovered in her pride how she had wrought that by enchantment, so</a>
<a id='line_14675'>that he should never be whole until the best knight of the world had</a>
<a id='line_14676'>searched his wounds. And so I have passed through all the lands</a>
<a id='line_14677'>christened to have him healed, except this land. And if I fail to heal</a>
<a id='line_14678'>him here in this land, I will never take more pain upon me, and that is</a>
<a id='line_14679'>pity, for he was a good knight, and of great nobleness. What is his</a>
<a id='line_14680'>name? said Arthur. My good and gracious lord, she said, his name is Sir</a>
<a id='line_14681'>Urre of the Mount. In good time, said the king, and sith ye are come</a>
<a id='line_14682'>into this land, ye are right welcome; and wit you well here shall your</a>
<a id='line_14683'>son be healed, an ever any Christian man may heal him. And for to give</a>
<a id='line_14684'>all other men of worship courage, I myself will assay to handle your</a>
<a id='line_14685'>son, and so shall all the kings, dukes, and earls that be here present</a>
<a id='line_14686'>with me at this time; thereto will I command them, and well I wot they</a>
<a id='line_14687'>shall obey and do after my commandment. And wit you well, said King</a>
<a id='line_14688'>Arthur unto Urre’s sister, I shall begin to handle him, and search unto</a>
<a id='line_14689'>my power, not presuming upon me that I am so worthy to heal your son by</a>
<a id='line_14690'>my deeds, but I will courage other men of worship to do as I will do.</a>
<a id='line_14691'>And then the king commanded all the kings, dukes, and earls, and all</a>
<a id='line_14692'>noble knights of the Round Table that were there that time present, to</a>
<a id='line_14693'>come into the meadow of Carlisle. And so at that time there were but an</a>
<a id='line_14694'>hundred and ten of the Round Table, for forty knights were that time</a>
<a id='line_14695'>away; and so here we must begin at King Arthur, as is kindly to begin</a>
<a id='line_14696'>at him that was the most man of worship that was christened at that</a>
<a id='line_14697'>time.</a>
<a id='line_14698'></a>

<a id='line_14701'></a>
<a id='line_14702'>CHAPTER XI. How King Arthur handled Sir Urre, and after him many other</a>
<a id='line_14703'>knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_14704'></a>
<a id='line_14705'></a>
<a id='line_14706'>Then King Arthur looked upon Sir Urre, and the king thought he was a</a>
<a id='line_14707'>full likely man when he was whole; and then King Arthur made him to be</a>
<a id='line_14708'>taken down off the litter and laid him upon the earth, and there was</a>
<a id='line_14709'>laid a cushion of gold that he should kneel upon. And then noble Arthur</a>
<a id='line_14710'>said: Fair knight, me repenteth of thy hurt, and for to courage all</a>
<a id='line_14711'>other noble knights I will pray thee softly to suffer me to handle your</a>
<a id='line_14712'>wounds. Most noble christened king, said Urre, do as ye list, for I am</a>
<a id='line_14713'>at the mercy of God, and at your commandment. So then Arthur softly</a>
<a id='line_14714'>handled him, and then some of his wounds renewed upon bleeding. Then</a>
<a id='line_14715'>the King Clarence of Northumberland searched, and it would not be. And</a>
<a id='line_14716'>then Sir Barant le Apres that was called the King with the Hundred</a>
<a id='line_14717'>Knights, he assayed and failed; and so did King Uriens of the land of</a>
<a id='line_14718'>Gore; so did King Anguish of Ireland; so did King Nentres of Garloth;</a>
<a id='line_14719'>so did King Carados of Scotland; so did the Duke Galahad, the haut</a>
<a id='line_14720'>prince; so did Constantine, that was Sir Carados’ son of Cornwall; so</a>
<a id='line_14721'>did Duke Chaleins of Clarance; so did the Earl Ulbause; so did the Earl</a>
<a id='line_14722'>Lambaile; so did the Earl Aristause.</a>
<a id='line_14723'></a>
<a id='line_14724'>Then came in Sir Gawaine with his three sons, Sir Gingalin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14725'>Florence, and Sir Lovel, these two were begotten upon Sir Brandiles’</a>
<a id='line_14726'>sister; and all they failed. Then came in Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris,</a>
<a id='line_14727'>Sir Mordred, and the good knight, Sir Gareth, that was of very</a>
<a id='line_14728'>knighthood worth all the brethren. So came knights of Launcelot’s kin,</a>
<a id='line_14729'>but Sir Launcelot was not that time in the court, for he was that time</a>
<a id='line_14730'>upon his adventures. Then Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de</a>
<a id='line_14731'>Ganis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine,</a>
<a id='line_14732'>Sir Galihodin, Sir Menaduke, Sir Villiars the Valiant, Sir Hebes le</a>
<a id='line_14733'>Renoumes. All these were of Sir Launcelot’s kin, and all they failed.</a>
<a id='line_14734'>Then came in Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Dodinas le Savage, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14735'>Dinadan, Sir Bruin le Noire, that Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile, and</a>
<a id='line_14736'>Sir Kay le Seneschal, Sir Kay de Stranges, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14737'>Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion of the</a>

<a id='line_14739'>Hardy.</a>
<a id='line_14740'></a>
<a id='line_14741'>Then came in Sir Astamor, and Sir Gromere, Grummor’s son, Sir Crosselm,</a>
<a id='line_14742'>Sir Servause le Breuse, that was called a passing strong knight, for as</a>
<a id='line_14743'>the book saith, the chief Lady of the Lake feasted Sir Launcelot and</a>
<a id='line_14744'>Servause le Breuse, and when she had feasted them both at sundry times</a>
<a id='line_14745'>she prayed them to give her a boon. And they granted it her. And then</a>
<a id='line_14746'>she prayed Sir Servause that he would promise her never to do battle</a>
<a id='line_14747'>against Sir Launcelot du Lake, and in the same wise she prayed Sir</a>
<a id='line_14748'>Launcelot never to do battle against Sir Servause, and so either</a>
<a id='line_14749'>promised her. For the French book saith, that Sir Servause had never</a>
<a id='line_14750'>courage nor lust to do battle against no man, but if it were against</a>
<a id='line_14751'>giants, and against dragons, and wild beasts. So we pass unto them that</a>
<a id='line_14752'>at the king’s request made them all that were there at that high feast,</a>
<a id='line_14753'>as of the knights of the Table Round, for to search Sir Urre: to that</a>
<a id='line_14754'>intent the king did it, to wit which was the noblest knight among them.</a>
<a id='line_14755'></a>
<a id='line_14756'>Then came Sir Aglovale, Sir Durnore, Sir Tor, that was begotten upon</a>
<a id='line_14757'>Aries, the cowherd’s wife, but he was begotten afore Aries wedded her,</a>
<a id='line_14758'>and King Pellinore begat them all, first Sir Tor, Sir Aglovale, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14759'>Durnore, Sir Lamorak, the most noblest knight one that ever was in</a>
<a id='line_14760'>Arthur’s days as for a worldly knight, and Sir Percivale that was</a>
<a id='line_14761'>peerless except Sir Galahad in holy deeds, but they died in the quest</a>
<a id='line_14762'>of the Sangreal. Then came Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Sir Lucan the</a>
<a id='line_14763'>Butler, Sir Bedevere his brother, Sir Brandiles, Sir Constantine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14764'>Cador’s son of Cornwall, that was king after Arthur’s days, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14765'>Clegis, Sir Sadok, Sir Dinas le Seneschal of Cornwall, Sir Fergus, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14766'>Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Clarrus of Cleremont, Sir Cloddrus, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14767'>Hectimere, Sir Edward of Carnarvon, Sir Dinas, Sir Priamus, that was</a>
<a id='line_14768'>christened by Sir Tristram the noble knight, and these three were</a>
<a id='line_14769'>brethren; Sir Hellaine le Blank that was son to Sir Bors, he begat him</a>
<a id='line_14770'>upon King Brandegoris’ daughter, and Sir Brian de Listinoise; Sir</a>
<a id='line_14771'>Gautere, Sir Reynold, Sir Gillemere, were three brethren that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14772'>Launcelot won upon a bridge in Sir Kay’s arms. Sir Guyart le Petite,</a>
<a id='line_14773'>Sir Bellangere le Beuse, that was son to the good knight, Sir Alisander</a>
<a id='line_14774'>le Orphelin, that was slain by the treason of King Mark. Also that</a>
<a id='line_14775'>traitor king slew the noble knight Sir Tristram, as he sat harping</a>
<a id='line_14776'>afore his lady La Beale Isoud, with a trenchant glaive, for whose death</a>
<a id='line_14777'>was much bewailing of every knight that ever were in Arthur’s days;</a>
<a id='line_14778'>there was never none so bewailed as was Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak,</a>
<a id='line_14779'>for they were traitorously slain, Sir Tristram by King Mark, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14780'>Lamorak by Sir Gawaine and his brethren. And this Sir Bellangere</a>
<a id='line_14781'>revenged the death of his father Alisander, and Sir Tristram slew King</a>
<a id='line_14782'>Mark, and La Beale Isoud died swooning upon the corse of Sir Tristram,</a>
<a id='line_14783'>whereof was great pity. And all that were with King Mark that were</a>
<a id='line_14784'>consenting to the death of Sir Tristram were slain, as Sir Andred and</a>
<a id='line_14785'>many other.</a>
<a id='line_14786'></a>
<a id='line_14787'>Then came Sir Hebes, Sir Morganore, Sir Sentraile, Sir Suppinabilis,</a>
<a id='line_14788'>Sir Bellangere le Orgulous, that the good knight Sir Lamorak won in</a>
<a id='line_14789'>plain battle; Sir Neroveus and Sir Plenorius, two good knights that Sir</a>
<a id='line_14790'>Launcelot won; Sir Darras, Sir Harry le Fise Lake, Sir Erminide,</a>
<a id='line_14791'>brother to King Hermaunce, for whom Sir Palomides fought at the Red</a>

<a id='line_14796'>the black lowe, Sir Epinogris, that was the king’s son of</a>
<a id='line_14797'>Northumberland. Sir Pelleas that loved the lady Ettard, and he had died</a>
<a id='line_14798'>for her love had not been one of the ladies of the lake, her name was</a>
<a id='line_14799'>Dame Nimue, and she wedded Sir Pelleas, and she saved him that he was</a>
<a id='line_14800'>never slain, and he was a full noble knight; and Sir Lamiel of Cardiff</a>
<a id='line_14801'>that was a great lover. Sir Plaine de Fors, Sir Melleaus de Lile, Sir</a>

<a id='line_14803'>Sir Colgrevance, Sir Hervise de la Forest Savage, Sir Marrok, the good</a>

<a id='line_14805'>wer-wolf, Sir Persaunt, Sir Pertilope, his brother, that was called the</a>
<a id='line_14806'>Green Knight, and Sir Perimones, brother to them both, that was called</a>
<a id='line_14807'>the Red Knight, that Sir Gareth won when he was called Beaumains. All</a>
<a id='line_14808'>these hundred knights and ten searched Sir Urre’s wounds by the</a>
<a id='line_14809'>commandment of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_14810'></a>
<a id='line_14811'></a>
<a id='line_14812'></a>
<a id='line_14813'></a>
<a id='line_14814'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot was commanded by Arthur to handle his</a>
<a id='line_14815'>wounds, and anon he was all whole, and how they thanked God.</a>
<a id='line_14816'></a>
<a id='line_14817'></a>
<a id='line_14818'>Mercy Jesu, said King Arthur, where is Sir Launcelot du Lake that he is</a>
<a id='line_14819'>not here at this time? Thus, as they stood and spake of many things,</a>
<a id='line_14820'>there was espied Sir Launcelot that came riding toward them, and told</a>
<a id='line_14821'>the king. Peace, said the king, let no manner thing be said until he be</a>
<a id='line_14822'>come to us. So when Sir Launcelot espied King Arthur, he descended from</a>
<a id='line_14823'>his horse and came to the king, and saluted him and them all. Anon as</a>
<a id='line_14824'>the maid, Sir Urre’s sister, saw Sir Launcelot, she ran to her brother</a>
<a id='line_14825'>thereas he lay in his litter, and said: Brother, here is come a knight</a>
<a id='line_14826'>that my heart giveth greatly unto. Fair sister, said Sir Urre, so doth</a>
<a id='line_14827'>my heart light against him, and certainly I hope now to be healed, for</a>
<a id='line_14828'>my heart giveth unto him more than to all these that have searched me.</a>
<a id='line_14829'></a>
<a id='line_14830'>Then said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot: Ye must do as we have done; and</a>
<a id='line_14831'>told Sir Launcelot what they had done, and showed him them all, that</a>
<a id='line_14832'>had searched him. Jesu defend me, said Sir Launcelot, when so many</a>
<a id='line_14833'>kings and knights have assayed and failed, that I should presume upon</a>
<a id='line_14834'>me to enchieve that all ye, my lords, might not enchieve. Ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_14835'>choose, said King Arthur, for I will command you for to do as we all</a>
<a id='line_14836'>have done. My most renowned lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye know well I</a>
<a id='line_14837'>dare not nor may not disobey your commandment, but an I might or durst,</a>
<a id='line_14838'>wit you well I would not take upon me to touch that wounded knight in</a>
<a id='line_14839'>that intent that I should pass all other knights; Jesu defend me from</a>
<a id='line_14840'>that shame. Ye take it wrong, said King Arthur, ye shall not do it for</a>
<a id='line_14841'>no presumption, but for to bear us fellowship, insomuch ye be a fellow</a>
<a id='line_14842'>of the Table Round; and wit you well, said King Arthur, an ye prevail</a>
<a id='line_14843'>not and heal him, I dare say there is no knight in this land may heal</a>
<a id='line_14844'>him, and therefore I pray you, do as we have done.</a>
<a id='line_14845'></a>
<a id='line_14846'>And then all the kings and knights for the most part prayed Sir</a>
<a id='line_14847'>Launcelot to search him; and then the wounded knight, Sir Urre, set him</a>
<a id='line_14848'>up weakly, and prayed Sir Launcelot heartily, saying: Courteous knight,</a>
<a id='line_14849'>I require thee for God’s sake heal my wounds, for methinketh ever</a>
<a id='line_14850'>sithen ye came here my wounds grieve me not. Ah, my fair lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14851'>Launcelot, Jesu would that I might help you; I shame me sore that I</a>
<a id='line_14852'>should be thus rebuked, for never was I able in worthiness to do so</a>
<a id='line_14853'>high a thing. Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down by the wounded knight</a>
<a id='line_14854'>saying: My lord Arthur, I must do your commandment, the which is sore</a>
<a id='line_14855'>against my heart. And then he held up his hands, and looked into the</a>
<a id='line_14856'>east, saying secretly unto himself: Thou blessed Father, Son, and Holy</a>
<a id='line_14857'>Ghost, I beseech thee of thy mercy, that my simple worship and honesty</a>
<a id='line_14858'>be saved, and thou blessed Trinity, thou mayst give power to heal this</a>
<a id='line_14859'>sick knight by thy great virtue and grace of thee, but, Good Lord,</a>
<a id='line_14860'>never of myself. And then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir Urre to let him see</a>
<a id='line_14861'>his head; and then devoutly kneeling he ransacked the three wounds,</a>
<a id='line_14862'>that they bled a little, and forthwith all the wounds fair healed, and</a>
<a id='line_14863'>seemed as they had been whole a seven year. And in likewise he searched</a>
<a id='line_14864'>his body of other three wounds, and they healed in likewise; and then</a>
<a id='line_14865'>the last of all he searched the which was in his hand, and anon it</a>
<a id='line_14866'>healed fair.</a>
<a id='line_14867'></a>
<a id='line_14868'>Then King Arthur and all the kings and knights kneeled down and gave</a>
<a id='line_14869'>thankings and lovings unto God and to His Blessed Mother. And ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_14870'>Launcelot wept as he had been a child that had been beaten. Then King</a>
<a id='line_14871'>Arthur let array priests and clerks in the most devoutest manner, to</a>
<a id='line_14872'>bring in Sir Urre within Carlisle, with singing and loving to God. And</a>
<a id='line_14873'>when this was done, the king let clothe him in the richest manner that</a>
<a id='line_14874'>could be thought; and then were there but few better made knights in</a>
<a id='line_14875'>all the court, for he was passingly well made and bigly; and Arthur</a>
<a id='line_14876'>asked Sir Urre how he felt himself. My good lord, he said, I felt</a>
<a id='line_14877'>myself never so lusty. Will ye joust and do deeds of arms? said King</a>
<a id='line_14878'>Arthur. Sir, said Urre, an I had all that longed unto jousts I would be</a>
<a id='line_14879'>soon ready.</a>
<a id='line_14880'></a>
<a id='line_14881'></a>
<a id='line_14882'></a>
<a id='line_14883'></a>
<a id='line_14884'>CHAPTER XIII. How there was a party made of an hundred knights against</a>
<a id='line_14885'>an hundred knights, and of other matters.</a>
<a id='line_14886'></a>
<a id='line_14887'></a>
<a id='line_14888'>Then Arthur made a party of hundred knights to be against an hundred</a>
<a id='line_14889'>knights. And so upon the morn they jousted for a diamond, but there</a>
<a id='line_14890'>jousted none of the dangerous knights; and so for to shorten this tale,</a>
<a id='line_14891'>Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine jousted best that day, for there was none of</a>
<a id='line_14892'>them but he overthrew and pulled down thirty knights; and then by the</a>
<a id='line_14893'>assent of all the kings and lords, Sir Urre and Sir Lavaine were made</a>
<a id='line_14894'>knights of the Table Round. And Sir Lavaine cast his love unto Dame</a>
<a id='line_14895'>Felelolie, Sir Urre’s sister, and then they were wedded together with</a>
<a id='line_14896'>great joy, and King Arthur gave to everych of them a barony of lands.</a>
<a id='line_14897'>And this Sir Urre would never go from Sir Launcelot, but he and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14898'>Lavaine awaited evermore upon him; and they were in all the court</a>
<a id='line_14899'>accounted for good knights, and full desirous in arms; and many noble</a>
<a id='line_14900'>deeds they did, for they would have no rest, but ever sought</a>
<a id='line_14901'>adventures.</a>
<a id='line_14902'></a>
<a id='line_14903'>Thus they lived in all that court with great noblesse and joy long</a>
<a id='line_14904'>time. But every night and day Sir Agravaine, Sir Gawaine’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_14905'>awaited Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot du Lake to put them to a</a>
<a id='line_14906'>rebuke and shame. And so I leave here of this tale, and overskip great</a>
<a id='line_14907'>books of Sir Launcelot du Lake, what great adventures he did when he</a>
<a id='line_14908'>was called Le Chevaler du Chariot. For as the French book saith,</a>
<a id='line_14909'>because of despite that knights and ladies called him the knight that</a>
<a id='line_14910'>rode in the chariot like as he were judged to the gallows, therefore in</a>
<a id='line_14911'>despite of all them that named him so, he was carried in a chariot a</a>
<a id='line_14912'>twelvemonth, for, but little after that he had slain Sir Meliagrance in</a>
<a id='line_14913'>the queen’s quarrel, he never in a twelvemonth came on horseback. And</a>
<a id='line_14914'>as the French book saith, he did that twelvemonth more than forty</a>
<a id='line_14915'>battles. And because I have lost the very matter of Le Chevaier du</a>
<a id='line_14916'>Chariot, I depart from the tale of Sir Launcelot, and here I go unto</a>
<a id='line_14917'>the morte of King Arthur; and that caused Sir Agravaine.</a>
<a id='line_14918'></a>

<a id='line_14930'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred were busy upon Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_14931'>for to disclose the love between Sir Launcelot and Queen Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_14932'></a>
<a id='line_14933'></a>
<a id='line_14934'>In May when every lusty heart flourisheth and bourgeoneth, for as the</a>
<a id='line_14935'>season is lusty to behold and comfortable, so man and woman rejoice and</a>
<a id='line_14936'>gladden of summer coming with his fresh flowers: for winter with his</a>
<a id='line_14937'>rough winds and blasts causeth a lusty man and woman to cower and sit</a>
<a id='line_14938'>fast by the fire. So in this season, as in the month of May, it befell</a>
<a id='line_14939'>a great anger and unhap that stinted not till the flower of chivalry of</a>
<a id='line_14940'>all the world was destroyed and slain; and all was long upon two</a>
<a id='line_14941'>unhappy knights the which were named Agravaine and Sir Mordred, that</a>
<a id='line_14942'>were brethren unto Sir Gawaine. For this Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred</a>
<a id='line_14943'>had ever a privy hate unto the queen Dame Guenever and to Sir</a>
<a id='line_14944'>Launcelot, and daily and nightly they ever watched upon Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_14945'></a>
<a id='line_14946'>So it mishapped, Sir Gawaine and all his brethren were in King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_14947'>chamber; and then Sir Agravaine said thus openly, and not in no</a>
<a id='line_14948'>counsel, that many knights might hear it: I marvel that we all be not</a>
<a id='line_14949'>ashamed both to see and to know how Sir Launcelot lieth daily and</a>
<a id='line_14950'>nightly by the queen, and all we know it so; and it is shamefully</a>
<a id='line_14951'>suffered of us all, that we all should suffer so noble a king as King</a>
<a id='line_14952'>Arthur is so to be shamed.</a>
<a id='line_14953'></a>
<a id='line_14954'>Then spake Sir Gawaine, and said: Brother Sir Agravaine, I pray you and</a>
<a id='line_14955'>charge you move no such matters no more afore me, for wit you well,</a>
<a id='line_14956'>said Sir Gawaine, I will not be of your counsel. So God me help, said</a>
<a id='line_14957'>Sir Gaheris and Sir Gareth, we will not be knowing, brother Agravaine,</a>
<a id='line_14958'>of your deeds. Then will I, said Sir Mordred. I lieve well that, said</a>
<a id='line_14959'>Sir Gawaine, for ever unto all unhappiness, brother Sir Mordred,</a>
<a id='line_14960'>thereto will ye grant; and I would that ye left all this, and made you</a>
<a id='line_14961'>not so busy, for I know, said Sir Gawaine, what will fall of it. Fall</a>
<a id='line_14962'>of it what fall may, said Sir Agravaine, I will disclose it to the</a>
<a id='line_14963'>king. Not by my counsel, said Sir Gawaine, for an there rise war and</a>
<a id='line_14964'>wrack betwixt Sir Launcelot and us, wit you well brother, there will</a>
<a id='line_14965'>many kings and great lords hold with Sir Launcelot. Also, brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_14966'>Agravaine, said Sir Gawaine, ye must remember how ofttimes Sir</a>
<a id='line_14967'>Launcelot hath rescued the king and the queen; and the best of us all</a>
<a id='line_14968'>had been full cold at the heart-root had not Sir Launcelot been better</a>
<a id='line_14969'>than we, and that hath he proved himself full oft. And as for my part,</a>
<a id='line_14970'>said Sir Gawaine, I will never be against Sir Launcelot for one day’s</a>
<a id='line_14971'>deed, when he rescued me from King Carados of the Dolorous Tower, and</a>
<a id='line_14972'>slew him, and saved my life. Also, brother Sir Agravaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_14973'>Mordred, in like wise Sir Launcelot rescued you both, and threescore</a>
<a id='line_14974'>and two, from Sir Turquin. Methinketh brother, such kind deeds and</a>
<a id='line_14975'>kindness should be remembered. Do as ye list, said Sir Agravaine, for I</a>
<a id='line_14976'>will lain it no longer. With these words came to them King Arthur. Now</a>
<a id='line_14977'>brother, stint your noise, said Sir Gawaine. We will not, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_14978'>Agravaine and Sir Mordred. Will ye so? said Sir Gawaine; then God speed</a>
<a id='line_14979'>you, for I will not hear your tales ne be of your counsel. No more will</a>
<a id='line_14980'>I, said Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris, for we will never say evil by that</a>
<a id='line_14981'>man; for because, said Sir Gareth, Sir Launcelot made me knight, by no</a>
<a id='line_14982'>manner owe I to say ill of him: and therewithal they three departed,</a>
<a id='line_14983'>making great dole. Alas, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Gareth, now is this</a>
<a id='line_14984'>realm wholly mischieved, and the noble fellowship of the Round Table</a>
<a id='line_14985'>shall be disparpled: so they departed.</a>

<a id='line_14991'>how King Arthur gave them licence to take him.</a>
<a id='line_14992'></a>
<a id='line_14993'></a>
<a id='line_14994'>And then Sir Arthur asked them what noise they made. My lord, said</a>
<a id='line_14995'>Agravaine, I shall tell you that I may keep no longer. Here is I, and</a>
<a id='line_14996'>my brother Sir Mordred, brake unto my brothers Sir Gawaine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_14997'>Gaheris, and to Sir Gareth, how this we know all, that Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_14998'>holdeth your queen, and hath done long; and we be your sister’s sons,</a>
<a id='line_14999'>and we may suffer it no longer, and all we wot that ye should be above</a>
<a id='line_15000'>Sir Launcelot; and ye are the king that made him knight, and therefore</a>
<a id='line_15001'>we will prove it, that he is a traitor to your person.</a>
<a id='line_15002'></a>
<a id='line_15003'>If it be so, said Sir Arthur, wit you well he is none other, but I</a>
<a id='line_15004'>would be loath to begin such a thing but I might have proofs upon it;</a>
<a id='line_15005'>for Sir Launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best</a>
<a id='line_15006'>knight among us all; and but if he be taken with the deed, he will</a>
<a id='line_15007'>fight with him that bringeth up the noise, and I know no knight that is</a>
<a id='line_15008'>able to match him. Therefore an it be sooth as ye say, I would he were</a>
<a id='line_15009'>taken with the deed. For as the French book saith, the king was full</a>
<a id='line_15010'>loath thereto, that any noise should be upon Sir Launcelot and his</a>
<a id='line_15011'>queen; for the king had a deeming, but he would not hear of it, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_15012'>Launcelot had done so much for him and the queen so many times, that</a>
<a id='line_15013'>wit ye well the king loved him passingly well. My lord, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15014'>Agravaine, ye shall ride to-morn a-hunting, and doubt ye not Sir</a>
<a id='line_15015'>Launcelot will not go with you. Then when it draweth toward night, ye</a>
<a id='line_15016'>may send the queen word that ye will lie out all that night, and so may</a>
<a id='line_15017'>ye send for your cooks, and then upon pain of death we shall take him</a>
<a id='line_15018'>that night with the queen, and outher we shall bring him to you dead or</a>
<a id='line_15019'>quick. I will well, said the king; then I counsel you, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_15020'>take with you sure fellowship. Sir, said Agravaine, my brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15021'>Mordred, and I, will take with us twelve knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_15022'>Beware, said King Arthur, for I warn you ye shall find him wight. Let</a>
<a id='line_15023'>us deal, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_15024'></a>
<a id='line_15025'>So on the morn King Arthur rode a-hunting, and sent word to the queen</a>
<a id='line_15026'>that he would be out all that night. Then Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred</a>
<a id='line_15027'>gat to them twelve knights, and hid themself in a chamber in the Castle</a>
<a id='line_15028'>of Carlisle, and these were their names: Sir Colgrevance, Sir Mador de</a>
<a id='line_15029'>la Porte, Sir Gingaline, Sir Meliot de Logris, Sir Petipase of</a>
<a id='line_15030'>Winchelsea, Sir Galleron of Galway, Sir Melion of the Mountain, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15031'>Astamore, Sir Gromore Somir Joure, Sir Curselaine, Sir Florence, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15032'>Lovel. So these twelve knights were with Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine,</a>
<a id='line_15033'>and all they were of Scotland, outher of Sir Gawaine’s kin, either</a>
<a id='line_15034'>well-willers to his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_15035'></a>
<a id='line_15036'>So when the night came, Sir Launcelot told Sir Bors how he would go</a>
<a id='line_15037'>that night and speak with the queen. Sir, said Sir Bors, ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_15038'>go this night by my counsel. Why? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15039'>Bors, I dread me ever of Sir Agravaine, that waiteth you daily to do</a>
<a id='line_15040'>you shame and us all; and never gave my heart against no going, that</a>
<a id='line_15041'>ever ye went to the queen, so much as now; for I mistrust that the king</a>
<a id='line_15042'>is out this night from the queen because peradventure he hath lain some</a>
<a id='line_15043'>watch for you and the queen, and therefore I dread me sore of treason.</a>
<a id='line_15044'>Have ye no dread, said Sir Launcelot, for I shall go and come again,</a>
<a id='line_15045'>and make no tarrying. Sir, said Sir Bors, that me repenteth, for I</a>
<a id='line_15046'>dread me sore that your going out this night shall wrath us all. Fair</a>
<a id='line_15047'>nephew, said Sir Launcelot, I marvel much why ye say thus, sithen the</a>
<a id='line_15048'>queen hath sent for me; and wit ye well I will not be so much a coward,</a>
<a id='line_15049'>but she shall understand I will see her good grace. God speed you well,</a>
<a id='line_15050'>said Sir Bors, and send you sound and safe again.</a>
<a id='line_15051'></a>
<a id='line_15052'></a>
<a id='line_15053'></a>
<a id='line_15054'></a>
<a id='line_15055'>CHAPTER III. How Sir Launcelot was espied in the queen’s chamber, and</a>
<a id='line_15056'>how Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred came with twelve knights to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_15057'></a>
<a id='line_15058'></a>
<a id='line_15059'>So Sir Launcelot departed, and took his sword under his arm, and so in</a>
<a id='line_15060'>his mantle that noble knight put himself in great Jeopardy; and so he</a>
<a id='line_15061'>passed till he came to the queen’s chamber, and then Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_15062'>lightly put into the chamber. And then, as the French book saith, the</a>
<a id='line_15063'>queen and Launcelot were together. And whether they were abed or at</a>
<a id='line_15064'>other manner of disports, me list not hereof make no mention, for love</a>
<a id='line_15065'>that time was not as is now-a-days. But thus as they were together,</a>
<a id='line_15066'>there came Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, with twelve knights with them</a>
<a id='line_15067'>of the Round Table, and they said with crying voice: Traitor-knight,</a>
<a id='line_15068'>Sir Launcelot du Lake, now art thou taken. And thus they cried with a</a>
<a id='line_15069'>loud voice, that all the court might hear it; and they all fourteen</a>
<a id='line_15070'>were armed at all points as they should fight in a battle. Alas said</a>
<a id='line_15071'>Queen Guenever, now are we mischieved both Madam, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15072'>is there here any armour within your chamber, that I might cover my</a>
<a id='line_15073'>poor body withal? An if there be any give it me, and I shall soon stint</a>
<a id='line_15074'>their malice, by the grace of God. Truly, said the queen, I have none</a>
<a id='line_15075'>armour, shield, sword, nor spear; wherefore I dread me sore our long</a>
<a id='line_15076'>love is come to a mischievous end, for I hear by their noise there be</a>
<a id='line_15077'>many noble knights, and well I wot they be surely armed, and against</a>
<a id='line_15078'>them ye may make no resistance. Wherefore ye are likely to be slain,</a>
<a id='line_15079'>and then shall I be brent. For an ye might escape them, said the queen,</a>
<a id='line_15080'>I would not doubt but that ye would rescue me in what danger that ever</a>
<a id='line_15081'>I stood in. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, in all my life thus was I never</a>
<a id='line_15082'>bestead, that I should be thus shamefully slain for lack of mine</a>
<a id='line_15083'>armour.</a>
<a id='line_15084'></a>
<a id='line_15085'>But ever in one Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred cried: Traitor-knight,</a>
<a id='line_15086'>come out of the queen’s chamber, for wit thou well thou art so beset</a>
<a id='line_15087'>that thou shalt not escape. O Jesu mercy, said Sir Launcelot, this</a>
<a id='line_15088'>shameful cry and noise I may not suffer, for better were death at once</a>
<a id='line_15089'>than thus to endure this pain. Then he took the queen in his arms, and</a>
<a id='line_15090'>kissed her, and said: Most noble Christian queen, I beseech you as ye</a>
<a id='line_15091'>have been ever my special good lady, and I at all times your true poor</a>
<a id='line_15092'>knight unto my power, and as I never failed you in right nor in wrong</a>
<a id='line_15093'>sithen the first day King Arthur made me knight, that ye will pray for</a>
<a id='line_15094'>my soul if that I here be slain; for well I am assured that Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_15095'>my nephew, and all the remnant of my kin, with Sir Lavaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15096'>Urre, that they will not fail you to rescue you from the fire; and</a>
<a id='line_15097'>therefore, mine own lady, recomfort yourself, whatsomever come of me,</a>
<a id='line_15098'>that ye go with Sir Bors, my nephew, and Sir Urre, and they all will do</a>
<a id='line_15099'>you all the pleasure that they can or may, that ye shall live like a</a>
<a id='line_15100'>queen upon my lands. Nay, Launcelot, said the queen, wit thou well I</a>
<a id='line_15101'>will never live after thy days, but an thou be slain I will take my</a>
<a id='line_15102'>death as meekly for Jesu Christ’s sake as ever did any Christian queen.</a>
<a id='line_15103'>Well, madam, said I-auncelot, sith it is so that the day is come that</a>
<a id='line_15104'>our love must depart, wit you well I shall sell my life as dear as I</a>
<a id='line_15105'>may; and a thousandfold, said Sir Launcelot, I am more heavier for you</a>
<a id='line_15106'>than for myself. And now I had liefer than to be lord of all</a>
<a id='line_15107'>Christendom, that I had sure armour upon me, that men might speak of my</a>
<a id='line_15108'>deeds or ever I were slain. Truly, said the queen, I would an it might</a>
<a id='line_15109'>please God that they would take me and slay me, and suffer you to</a>
<a id='line_15110'>escape. That shall never be, said Sir Launcelot, God defend me from</a>
<a id='line_15111'>such a shame, but Jesu be Thou my shield and mine armour!</a>
<a id='line_15112'></a>
<a id='line_15113'></a>
<a id='line_15114'></a>
<a id='line_15115'></a>
<a id='line_15116'>CHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot slew Sir Colgrevance, and armed him in</a>
<a id='line_15117'>his harness, and after slew Sir Agravaine, and twelve of his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_15118'></a>
<a id='line_15119'></a>
<a id='line_15120'>And therewith Sir Launcelot wrapped his mantle about his arm well and</a>
<a id='line_15121'>surely; and by then they had gotten a great form out of the hall, and</a>
<a id='line_15122'>therewithal they rashed at the door. Fair lords, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15123'>leave your noise and your rashing, and I shall set open this door, and</a>
<a id='line_15124'>then may ye do with me what it liketh you. Come off then, said they</a>
<a id='line_15125'>all, and do it, for it availeth thee not to strive against us all; and</a>
<a id='line_15126'>therefore let us into this chamber, and we shall save thy life until</a>
<a id='line_15127'>thou come to King Arthur. Then Launcelot unbarred the door, and with</a>
<a id='line_15128'>his left hand he held it open a little, so that but one man might come</a>
<a id='line_15129'>in at once; and so there came striding a good knight, a much man and</a>
<a id='line_15130'>large, and his name was Colgrevance of Gore, and he with a sword struck</a>
<a id='line_15131'>at Sir Launcelot mightily; and he put aside the stroke, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_15132'>such a buffet upon the helmet, that he fell grovelling dead within the</a>
<a id='line_15133'>chamber door. And then Sir Launcelot with great might drew that dead</a>
<a id='line_15134'>knight within the chamber door; and Sir Launcelot with help of the</a>
<a id='line_15135'>queen and her ladies was lightly armed in Sir Colgrevance’s armour.</a>
<a id='line_15136'></a>
<a id='line_15137'>And ever stood Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred crying: Traitor-knight,</a>
<a id='line_15138'>come out of the queen’s chamber. Leave your noise, said Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15139'>unto Sir Agravaine, for wit you well, Sir Agravaine, ye shall not</a>
<a id='line_15140'>prison me this night; and therefore an ye do by my counsel, go ye all</a>
<a id='line_15141'>from this chamber door, and make not such crying and such manner of</a>
<a id='line_15142'>slander as ye do; for I promise you by my knighthood, an ye will depart</a>
<a id='line_15143'>and make no more noise, I shall as to-morn appear afore you all before</a>
<a id='line_15144'>the king, and then let it be seen which of you all, outher else ye all,</a>
<a id='line_15145'>that will accuse me of treason; and there I shall answer you as a</a>
<a id='line_15146'>knight should, that hither I came to the queen for no manner of mal</a>
<a id='line_15147'>engin, and that will I prove and make it good upon you with my hands.</a>
<a id='line_15148'>Fie on thee, traitor, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, we will have</a>
<a id='line_15149'>thee maugre thy head, and slay thee if we list; for we let thee wit we</a>
<a id='line_15150'>have the choice of King Arthur to save thee or to slay thee. Ah sirs,</a>
<a id='line_15151'>said Sir Launcelot, is there none other grace with you? then keep</a>
<a id='line_15152'>yourself.</a>
<a id='line_15153'></a>
<a id='line_15154'>So then Sir Launcelot set all open the chamber door, and mightily and</a>
<a id='line_15155'>knightly he strode in amongst them; and anon at the first buffet he</a>
<a id='line_15156'>slew Sir Agravaine. And twelve of his fellows after, within a little</a>
<a id='line_15157'>while after, he laid them cold to the earth, for there was none of the</a>
<a id='line_15158'>twelve that might stand Sir Launcelot one buffet. Also Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15159'>wounded Sir Mordred, and he fled with all his might. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_15160'>Launcelot returned again unto the queen, and said: Madam, now wit you</a>
<a id='line_15161'>well all our true love is brought to an end, for now will King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_15162'>ever be my foe; and therefore, madam, an it like you that I may have</a>
<a id='line_15163'>you with me, I shall save you from all manner adventures dangerous.</a>
<a id='line_15164'>That is not best, said the queen; meseemeth now ye have done so much</a>
<a id='line_15165'>harm, it will be best ye hold you still with this. And if ye see that</a>
<a id='line_15166'>as to-morn they will put me unto the death, then may ye rescue me as ye</a>
<a id='line_15167'>think best. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, for have ye no doubt,</a>
<a id='line_15168'>while I am living I shall rescue you. And then he kissed her, and</a>
<a id='line_15169'>either gave other a ring; and so there he left the queen, and went</a>
<a id='line_15170'>until his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_15171'></a>
<a id='line_15172'></a>
<a id='line_15173'></a>
<a id='line_15174'></a>
<a id='line_15175'>CHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to Sir Bors, and told him how he had</a>
<a id='line_15176'>sped, and in what adventure he had been, and how he had escaped.</a>
<a id='line_15177'></a>
<a id='line_15178'></a>
<a id='line_15179'>When Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot he was never so glad of his home-coming</a>
<a id='line_15180'>as he was then. Jesu mercy, said Sir Launcelot, why be ye all armed:</a>
<a id='line_15181'>what meaneth this? Sir, said Sir Bors, after ye were departed from us,</a>
<a id='line_15182'>we all that be of your blood and your well-willers were so dretched</a>
<a id='line_15183'>that some of us leapt out of our beds naked, and some in their dreams</a>
<a id='line_15184'>caught naked swords in their hands; therefore, said Sir Bors, we deem</a>
<a id='line_15185'>there is some great strife at hand; and then we all deemed that ye were</a>
<a id='line_15186'>betrapped with some treason, and therefore we made us thus ready, what</a>
<a id='line_15187'>need that ever ye were in.</a>
<a id='line_15188'></a>
<a id='line_15189'>My fair nephew, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Bors, now shall ye wit all,</a>
<a id='line_15190'>that this night I was more harder bestead than ever I was in my life,</a>
<a id='line_15191'>and yet I escaped. And so he told them all how and in what manner, as</a>
<a id='line_15192'>ye have heard to-fore. And therefore, my fellows, said Sir Launcelot, I</a>
<a id='line_15193'>pray you all that ye will be of good heart in what need somever I</a>
<a id='line_15194'>stand, for now is war come to us all. Sir, said Bors, all is welcome</a>
<a id='line_15195'>that God sendeth us, and we have had much weal with you and much</a>
<a id='line_15196'>worship, and therefore we will take the woe with you as we have taken</a>
<a id='line_15197'>the weal. And therefore, they said all (there were many good knights),</a>
<a id='line_15198'>look ye take no discomfort, for there nis no bands of knights under</a>
<a id='line_15199'>heaven but we shall be able to grieve them as much as they may us. And</a>
<a id='line_15200'>therefore discomfort not yourself by no manner, and we shall gather</a>
<a id='line_15201'>together that we love, and that loveth us, and what that ye will have</a>
<a id='line_15202'>done shall be done. And therefore, Sir Launcelot, said they, we will</a>
<a id='line_15203'>take the woe with the weal. Grant mercy, said Sir Launcelot, of your</a>
<a id='line_15204'>good comfort, for in my great distress, my fair nephew, ye comfort me</a>
<a id='line_15205'>greatly, and much I am beholding unto you. But this, my fair nephew, I</a>
<a id='line_15206'>would that ye did in all haste that ye may, or it be forth days, that</a>
<a id='line_15207'>ye will look in their lodging that be lodged here nigh about the king,</a>
<a id='line_15208'>which will hold with me, and which will not, for now I would know which</a>
<a id='line_15209'>were my friends from my foes. Sir, said Sir Bors, I shall do my pain,</a>
<a id='line_15210'>and or it be seven of the clock I shall wit of such as ye have said</a>
<a id='line_15211'>before, who will hold with you.</a>
<a id='line_15212'></a>
<a id='line_15213'>Then Sir Bors called unto him Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15214'>Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir Gahalantine, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15215'>Galihodin, Sir Galihud, Sir Menadeuke Sir Villiers the Valiant, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15216'>Hebes le Renoumes, Sir Lavaine Sir Urre of Hungary, Sir Nerounes, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15217'>Plenorius. These two knights Sir Launcelot made, and the one he won</a>
<a id='line_15218'>upon a bridge, and therefore they would never be against him. And Harry</a>
<a id='line_15219'>le Fise du Lake, and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower, and Sir Melias</a>
<a id='line_15220'>de Lile, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse, that was Sir Alisander’s son Le</a>
<a id='line_15221'>Orphelin, because his mother Alice le Beale Pellerin and she was kin</a>
<a id='line_15222'>unto Sir Launcelot, and he held with him. So there came Sir Palomides</a>
<a id='line_15223'>and Sir Safere, his brother, to hold with Sir Launcelot, and Sir Clegis</a>
<a id='line_15224'>of Sadok, and Sir Dinas, Sir Clarius of Cleremont. So these</a>
<a id='line_15225'>two-and-twenty knights drew them together, and by then they were armed</a>
<a id='line_15226'>on horseback, and promised Sir Launcelot to do what he would. Then</a>
<a id='line_15227'>there fell to them, what of North Wales and of Cornwall, for Sir</a>
<a id='line_15228'>Lamorak’s sake and for Sir Tristram’s sake, to the number of a</a>
<a id='line_15229'>fourscore knights.</a>
<a id='line_15230'></a>
<a id='line_15231'>My lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well, I have been ever since I</a>
<a id='line_15232'>came into this country well willed unto my lord, King Arthur, and unto</a>
<a id='line_15233'>my lady, Queen Guenever, unto my power; and this night because my lady</a>
<a id='line_15234'>the queen sent for me to speak with her, I suppose it was made by</a>
<a id='line_15235'>treason, howbeit I dare largely excuse her person, notwithstanding I</a>
<a id='line_15236'>was there by a forecast near slain, but as Jesu provided me I escaped</a>
<a id='line_15237'>all their malice and treason. And then that noble knight Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15238'>told them all how he was hard bestead in the queen’s chamber, and how</a>
<a id='line_15239'>and in what manner he escaped from them. And therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15240'>Launcelot, wit you well, my fair lords, I am sure there nis but war</a>
<a id='line_15241'>unto me and mine. And for because I have slain this night these</a>
<a id='line_15242'>knights, I wot well, as is Sir Agravaine Sir Gawaine’s brother, and at</a>
<a id='line_15243'>the least twelve of his fellows, for this cause now I am sure of mortal</a>
<a id='line_15244'>war, for these knights were sent and ordained by King Arthur to betray</a>
<a id='line_15245'>me. And therefore the king will in his heat and malice judge the queen</a>
<a id='line_15246'>to the fire, and that may I not suffer, that she should be brent for my</a>
<a id='line_15247'>sake; for an I may be heard and suffered and so taken, I will fight for</a>
<a id='line_15248'>the queen, that she is a true lady unto her lord; but the king in his</a>
<a id='line_15249'>heat I dread me will not take me as I ought to be taken.</a>
<a id='line_15250'></a>

<a id='line_15254'>CHAPTER VI. Of the counsel and advice that was taken by Sir Launcelot</a>

<a id='line_15256'></a>
<a id='line_15257'></a>
<a id='line_15258'>My lord, Sir Launcelot, said Sir Bors, by mine advice ye shall take the</a>
<a id='line_15259'>woe with the weal, and take it in patience, and thank God of it. And</a>
<a id='line_15260'>sithen it is fallen as it is, I counsel you keep yourself, for an ye</a>
<a id='line_15261'>will yourself, there is no fellowship of knights christened that shall</a>
<a id='line_15262'>do you wrong. Also I will counsel you my lord, Sir Launcelot, than an</a>
<a id='line_15263'>my lady, Queen Guenever, be in distress, insomuch as she is in pain for</a>
<a id='line_15264'>your sake, that ye knightly rescue her; an ye did otherwise, all the</a>
<a id='line_15265'>world will speak of you shame to the world’s end. Insomuch as ye were</a>
<a id='line_15266'>taken with her, whether ye did right or wrong, it is now your part to</a>
<a id='line_15267'>hold with the queen, that she be not slain and put to a mischievous</a>
<a id='line_15268'>death, for an she so die the shame shall be yours. Jesu defend me from</a>
<a id='line_15269'>shame, said Sir Launcelot, and keep and save my lady the queen from</a>
<a id='line_15270'>villainy and shameful death, and that she never be destroyed in my</a>
<a id='line_15271'>default; wherefore my fair lords, my kin, and my friends, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15272'>Launcelot, what will ye do? Then they said all: We will do as ye will</a>
<a id='line_15273'>do. I put this to you, said Sir Launcelot, that if my lord Arthur by</a>
<a id='line_15274'>evil counsel will to-morn in his heat put my lady the queen to the fire</a>
<a id='line_15275'>there to be brent, now I pray you counsel me what is best to do. Then</a>
<a id='line_15276'>they said all at once with one voice: Sir, us thinketh best that ye</a>
<a id='line_15277'>knightly rescue the queen, insomuch as she shall be brent it is for</a>
<a id='line_15278'>your sake; and it is to suppose, an ye might be handled, ye should have</a>
<a id='line_15279'>the same death, or a more shamefuler death. And sir, we say all, that</a>
<a id='line_15280'>ye have many times rescued her from death for other men’s quarrels, us</a>
<a id='line_15281'>seemeth it is more your worship that ye rescue the queen from this</a>
<a id='line_15282'>peril, insomuch she hath it for your sake.</a>
<a id='line_15283'></a>
<a id='line_15284'>Then Sir Launcelot stood still, and said: My fair lords, wit you well I</a>
<a id='line_15285'>would be loath to do that thing that should dishonour you or my blood,</a>
<a id='line_15286'>and wit you well I would be loath that my lady, the queen, should die a</a>
<a id='line_15287'>shameful death; but an it be so that ye will counsel me to rescue her,</a>
<a id='line_15288'>I must do much harm or I rescue her; and peradventure I shall there</a>
<a id='line_15289'>destroy some of my best friends, that should much repent me; and</a>
<a id='line_15290'>peradventure there be some, an they could well bring it about, or</a>
<a id='line_15291'>disobey my lord King Arthur, they would soon come to me, the which I</a>
<a id='line_15292'>were loath to hurt. And if so be that I rescue her, where shall I keep</a>
<a id='line_15293'>her? That shall be the least care of us all, said Sir Bors. How did the</a>
<a id='line_15294'>noble knight Sir Tristram, by your good will? kept not he with him La</a>
<a id='line_15295'>Beale Isoud near three year in Joyous Gard? the which was done by your</a>
<a id='line_15296'>alther device, and that same place is your own; and in likewise may ye</a>
<a id='line_15297'>do an ye list, and take the queen lightly away, if it so be the king</a>
<a id='line_15298'>will judge her to be brent; and in Joyous Gard ye may keep her long</a>
<a id='line_15299'>enough until the heat of the king be past. And then shall ye bring</a>
<a id='line_15300'>again the queen to the king with great worship; and then peradventure</a>
<a id='line_15301'>ye shall have thank for her bringing home, and love and thank where</a>
<a id='line_15302'>other shall have maugre.</a>
<a id='line_15303'></a>
<a id='line_15304'>That is hard to do, said Sir Launcelot, for by Sir Tristram I may have</a>
<a id='line_15305'>a warning, for when by means of treaties, Sir Tristram brought again La</a>
<a id='line_15306'>Beale Isoud unto King Mark from Joyous Gard, look what befell on the</a>
<a id='line_15307'>end, how shamefully that false traitor King Mark slew him as he sat</a>
<a id='line_15308'>harping afore his lady La Beale Isoud, with a grounden glaive he thrust</a>
<a id='line_15309'>him in behind to the heart. It grieveth me, said Sir Launcelot, to</a>
<a id='line_15310'>speak of his death, for all the world may not find such a knight. All</a>
<a id='line_15311'>this is truth, said Sir Bors, but there is one thing shall courage you</a>
<a id='line_15312'>and us all, ye know well King Arthur and King Mark were never like of</a>
<a id='line_15313'>conditions, for there was never yet man could prove King Arthur untrue</a>
<a id='line_15314'>of his promise.</a>
<a id='line_15315'></a>
<a id='line_15316'>So to make short tale, they were all consented that for better outher</a>
<a id='line_15317'>for worse, if so were that the queen were on that morn brought to the</a>
<a id='line_15318'>fire, shortly they all would rescue her. And so by the advice of Sir</a>
<a id='line_15319'>Launcelot, they put them all in an embushment in a wood, as nigh</a>
<a id='line_15320'>Carlisle as they might, and there they abode still, to wit what the</a>
<a id='line_15321'>king would do.</a>
<a id='line_15322'></a>
<a id='line_15323'></a>
<a id='line_15324'></a>
<a id='line_15325'></a>
<a id='line_15326'>CHAPTER VII. How Sir Mordred rode hastily to the king, to tell him of</a>
<a id='line_15327'>the affray and death of Sir Agravaine and the other knights.</a>
<a id='line_15328'></a>
<a id='line_15329'></a>
<a id='line_15330'>Now turn we again unto Sir Mordred, that when he was escaped from the</a>
<a id='line_15331'>noble knight, Sir Launcelot, he anon gat his horse and mounted upon</a>
<a id='line_15332'>him, and rode unto King Arthur, sore wounded and smitten, and all</a>
<a id='line_15333'>forbled; and there he told the king all how it was, and how they were</a>
<a id='line_15334'>all slain save himself all only. Jesu mercy, how may this be? said the</a>
<a id='line_15335'>king; took ye him in the queen’s chamber? Yea, so God me help, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15336'>Mordred, there we found him unarmed, and there he slew Colgrevance, and</a>
<a id='line_15337'>armed him in his armour; and all this he told the king from the</a>
<a id='line_15338'>beginning to the ending. Jesu mercy, said the king, he is a marvellous</a>
<a id='line_15339'>knight of prowess. Alas, me sore repenteth, said the king, that ever</a>
<a id='line_15340'>Sir Launcelot should be against me. Now I am sure the noble fellowship</a>
<a id='line_15341'>of the Round Table is broken for ever, for with him will many a noble</a>
<a id='line_15342'>knight hold; and now it is fallen so, said the king, that I may not</a>
<a id='line_15343'>with my worship, but the queen must suffer the death. So then there was</a>
<a id='line_15344'>made great ordinance in this heat, that the queen must be judged to the</a>
<a id='line_15345'>death. And the law was such in those days that whatsomever they were,</a>
<a id='line_15346'>of what estate or degree, if they were found guilty of treason, there</a>
<a id='line_15347'>should be none other remedy but death; and outher the men or the taking</a>
<a id='line_15348'>with the deed should be causer of their hasty judgment. And right so</a>
<a id='line_15349'>was it ordained for Queen Guenever, because Sir Mordred was escaped</a>
<a id='line_15350'>sore wounded, and the death of thirteen knights of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_15351'>These proofs and experiences caused King Arthur to command the queen to</a>
<a id='line_15352'>the fire there to be brent.</a>
<a id='line_15353'></a>
<a id='line_15354'>Then spake Sir Gawaine, and said: My lord Arthur, I would counsel you</a>
<a id='line_15355'>not to be over-hasty, but that ye would put it in respite, this</a>
<a id='line_15356'>judgment of my lady the queen, for many causes. One it is, though it</a>
<a id='line_15357'>were so that Sir Launcelot were found in the queen’s chamber, yet it</a>
<a id='line_15358'>might be so that he came thither for none evil; for ye know my lord,</a>
<a id='line_15359'>said Sir Gawaine, that the queen is much beholden unto Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15360'>more than unto any other knight, for ofttimes he hath saved her life,</a>
<a id='line_15361'>and done battle for her when all the court refused the queen; and</a>
<a id='line_15362'>peradventure she sent for him for goodness and for none evil, to reward</a>
<a id='line_15363'>him for his good deeds that he had done to her in times past. And</a>
<a id='line_15364'>peradventure my lady, the queen, sent for him to that intent that Sir</a>
<a id='line_15365'>Launcelot should come to her good grace privily and secretly, weening</a>
<a id='line_15366'>to her that it was best so to do, in eschewing and dreading of slander;</a>
<a id='line_15367'>for ofttimes we do many things that we ween it be for the best, and yet</a>
<a id='line_15368'>peradventure it turneth to the worst. For I dare say, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_15369'>my lady, your queen, is to you both good and true; and as for Sir</a>
<a id='line_15370'>Launcelot, said Sir Gawaine, I dare say he will make it good upon any</a>
<a id='line_15371'>knight living that will put upon himself villainy or shame, and in like</a>
<a id='line_15372'>wise he will make good for my lady, Dame Guenever.</a>
<a id='line_15373'></a>
<a id='line_15374'>That I believe well, said King Arthur, but I will not that way with Sir</a>
<a id='line_15375'>Launcelot, for he trusteth so much upon his hands and his might that he</a>
<a id='line_15376'>doubteth no man; and therefore for my queen he shall never fight more,</a>
<a id='line_15377'>for she shall have the law. And if I may get Sir Launcelot, wit you</a>
<a id='line_15378'>well he shall have a shameful death. Jesu defend, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_15379'>that I may never see it. Why say ye so? said King Arthur; forsooth ye</a>
<a id='line_15380'>have no cause to love Sir Launcelot, for this night last past he slew</a>
<a id='line_15381'>your brother, Sir Agravaine, a full good knight, and almost he had</a>
<a id='line_15382'>slain your other brother, Sir Mordred, and also there he slew thirteen</a>
<a id='line_15383'>noble knights; and also, Sir Gawaine, remember you he slew two sons of</a>
<a id='line_15384'>yours, Sir Florence and Sir Lovel. My lord, said Sir Gawaine, of all</a>
<a id='line_15385'>this I have knowledge, of whose deaths I repent me sore; but insomuch I</a>
<a id='line_15386'>gave them warning, and told my brethren and my sons aforehand what</a>
<a id='line_15387'>would fall in the end, insomuch they would not do by my counsel, I will</a>
<a id='line_15388'>not meddle me thereof, nor revenge me nothing of their deaths; for I</a>
<a id='line_15389'>told them it was no boot to strive with Sir Launcelot. Howbeit I am</a>
<a id='line_15390'>sorry of the death of my brethren and of my sons, for they are the</a>
<a id='line_15391'>causers of their own death; for ofttimes I warned my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_15392'>Agravaine, and I told him the perils the which be now fallen.</a>
<a id='line_15393'></a>
<a id='line_15394'></a>
<a id='line_15395'></a>
<a id='line_15396'></a>
<a id='line_15397'>CHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and his kinsmen rescued the queen from</a>
<a id='line_15398'>the fire, and how he slew many knights.</a>
<a id='line_15399'></a>
<a id='line_15400'></a>
<a id='line_15401'>Then said the noble King Arthur to Sir Gawaine: Dear nephew, I pray you</a>
<a id='line_15402'>make you ready in your best armour, with your brethren, Sir Gaheris and</a>
<a id='line_15403'>Sir Gareth, to bring my queen to the fire, there to have her judgment</a>
<a id='line_15404'>and receive the death. Nay, my most noble lord, said Sir Gawaine, that</a>
<a id='line_15405'>will I never do; for wit you well I will never be in that place where</a>
<a id='line_15406'>so noble a queen as is my lady, Dame Guenever, shall take a shameful</a>
<a id='line_15407'>end. For wit you well, said Sir Gawaine, my heart will never serve me</a>
<a id='line_15408'>to see her die; and it shall never be said that ever I was of your</a>
<a id='line_15409'>counsel of her death.</a>
<a id='line_15410'></a>
<a id='line_15411'>Then said the king to Sir Gawaine: Suffer your brothers Sir Gaheris and</a>
<a id='line_15412'>Sir Gareth to be there. My lord, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well they</a>
<a id='line_15413'>will be loath to be there present, because of many adventures the which</a>
<a id='line_15414'>be like there to fall, but they are young and full unable to say you</a>
<a id='line_15415'>nay. Then spake Sir Gaheris, and the good knight Sir Gareth, unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_15416'>Arthur: Sir, ye may well command us to be there, but wit you well it</a>
<a id='line_15417'>shall be sore against our will; but an we be there by your strait</a>
<a id='line_15418'>commandment ye shall plainly hold us there excused: we will be there in</a>
<a id='line_15419'>peaceable wise, and bear none harness of war upon us. In the name of</a>
<a id='line_15420'>God, said the king, then make you ready, for she shall soon have her</a>
<a id='line_15421'>judgment anon. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, that ever I should endure to see</a>
<a id='line_15422'>this woful day. So Sir Gawaine turned him and wept heartily, and so he</a>
<a id='line_15423'>went into his chamber; and then the queen was led forth without</a>
<a id='line_15424'>Carlisle, and there she was despoiled into her smock. And so then her</a>
<a id='line_15425'>ghostly father was brought to her, to be shriven of her misdeeds. Then</a>
<a id='line_15426'>was there weeping, and wailing, and wringing of hands, of many lords</a>
<a id='line_15427'>and ladies, but there were but few in comparison that would bear any</a>
<a id='line_15428'>armour for to strength the death of the queen.</a>
<a id='line_15429'></a>
<a id='line_15430'>Then was there one that Sir Launcelot had sent unto that place for to</a>
<a id='line_15431'>espy what time the queen should go unto her death; and anon as he saw</a>
<a id='line_15432'>the queen despoiled into her smock, and so shriven, then he gave Sir</a>
<a id='line_15433'>Launcelot warning. Then was there but spurring and plucking up of</a>
<a id='line_15434'>horses, and right so they came to the fire. And who that stood against</a>
<a id='line_15435'>them, there were they slain; there might none withstand Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15436'>so all that bare arms and withstood them, there were they slain, full</a>
<a id='line_15437'>many a noble knight. For there was slain Sir Belliance le Orgulous, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15438'>Segwarides, Sir Griflet, Sir Brandiles, Sir Aglovale, Sir Tor; Sir</a>
<a id='line_15439'>Gauter, Sir Gillimer, Sir Reynolds’ three brethren; Sir Damas, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15440'>Priamus, Sir Kay the Stranger, Sir Driant, Sir Lambegus, Sir Herminde;</a>
<a id='line_15441'>Sir Pertilope, Sir Perimones, two brethren that were called the Green</a>
<a id='line_15442'>Knight and the Red Knight. And so in this rushing and hurling, as Sir</a>
<a id='line_15443'>Launcelot thrang here and there, it mishapped him to slay Gaheris and</a>
<a id='line_15444'>Sir Gareth, the noble knight, for they were unarmed and unware. For as</a>
<a id='line_15445'>the French book saith, Sir Launcelot smote Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_15446'>upon the brain-pans, wherethrough they were slain in the field; howbeit</a>
<a id='line_15447'>in very truth Sir Launcelot saw them not, and so were they found dead</a>
<a id='line_15448'>among the thickest of the press.</a>
<a id='line_15449'></a>
<a id='line_15450'>Then when Sir Launcelot had thus done, and slain and put to flight all</a>
<a id='line_15451'>that would withstand him, then he rode straight unto Dame Guenever, and</a>
<a id='line_15452'>made a kirtle and a gown to be cast upon her; and then he made her to</a>
<a id='line_15453'>be set behind him, and prayed her to be of good cheer. Wit you well the</a>
<a id='line_15454'>queen was glad that she was escaped from the death. And then she</a>
<a id='line_15455'>thanked God and Sir Launcelot; and so he rode his way with the queen,</a>
<a id='line_15456'>as the French book saith, unto Joyous Gard, and there he kept her as a</a>
<a id='line_15457'>noble knight should do; and many great lords and some kings sent Sir</a>
<a id='line_15458'>Launcelot many good knights, and many noble knights drew unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_15459'>Launcelot. When this was known openly, that King Arthur and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15460'>Launcelot were at debate, many knights were glad of their debate, and</a>
<a id='line_15461'>many were full heavy of their debate.</a>
<a id='line_15462'></a>
<a id='line_15463'></a>
<a id='line_15464'></a>
<a id='line_15465'></a>
<a id='line_15466'>CHAPTER IX. Of the sorrow and lamentation of King Arthur for the death</a>
<a id='line_15467'>of his nephews and other good knights, and also for the queen, his</a>
<a id='line_15468'>wife.</a>
<a id='line_15469'></a>
<a id='line_15470'></a>
<a id='line_15471'>So turn we again unto King Arthur, that when it was told him how and in</a>
<a id='line_15472'>what manner of wise the queen was taken away from the fire, and when he</a>
<a id='line_15473'>heard of the death of his noble knights, and in especial of Sir Gaheris</a>
<a id='line_15474'>and Sir Gareth’s death, then the king swooned for pure sorrow. And when</a>
<a id='line_15475'>he awoke of his swoon, then he said: Alas, that ever I bare crown upon</a>
<a id='line_15476'>my head! for now have I lost the fairest fellowship of noble knights</a>
<a id='line_15477'>that ever held Christian king together. Alas, my good knights be slain</a>
<a id='line_15478'>away from me: now within these two days I have lost forty knights, and</a>
<a id='line_15479'>also the noble fellowship of Sir Launcelot and his blood, for now I may</a>
<a id='line_15480'>never hold them together no more with my worship. Alas that ever this</a>
<a id='line_15481'>war began. Now fair fellows, said the king, I charge you that no man</a>
<a id='line_15482'>tell Sir Gawaine of the death of his two brethren; for I am sure, said</a>
<a id='line_15483'>the king, when Sir Gawaine heareth tell that Sir Gareth is dead he will</a>
<a id='line_15484'>go nigh out of his mind. Mercy Jesu, said the king, why slew he Sir</a>
<a id='line_15485'>Gareth and Sir Gaheris, for I dare say as for Sir Gareth he loved Sir</a>
<a id='line_15486'>Launcelot above all men earthly. That is truth, said some knights, but</a>
<a id='line_15487'>they were slain in the hurtling as Sir Launcelot thrang in the thick of</a>
<a id='line_15488'>the press; and as they were unarmed he smote them and wist not whom</a>
<a id='line_15489'>that he smote, and so unhappily they were slain. The death of them,</a>
<a id='line_15490'>said Arthur, will cause the greatest mortal war that ever was; I am</a>
<a id='line_15491'>sure, wist Sir Gawaine that Sir Gareth were slain, I should never have</a>
<a id='line_15492'>rest of him till I had destroyed Sir Launcelot’s kin and himself both,</a>
<a id='line_15493'>outher else he to destroy me. And therefore, said the king, wit you</a>
<a id='line_15494'>well my heart was never so heavy as it is now, and much more I am</a>
<a id='line_15495'>sorrier for my good knights’ loss than for the loss of my fair queen;</a>
<a id='line_15496'>for queens I might have enow, but such a fellowship of good knights</a>
<a id='line_15497'>shall never be together in no company. And now I dare say, said King</a>
<a id='line_15498'>Arthur, there was never Christian king held such a fellowship together;</a>
<a id='line_15499'>and alas that ever Sir Launcelot and I should be at debate. Ah</a>
<a id='line_15500'>Agravaine, Agravaine, said the king, Jesu forgive it thy soul, for</a>
<a id='line_15501'>thine evil will, that thou and thy brother Sir Mordred hadst unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_15502'>Launcelot, hath caused all this sorrow: and ever among these complaints</a>
<a id='line_15503'>the king wept and swooned.</a>
<a id='line_15504'></a>
<a id='line_15505'>Then there came one unto Sir Gawaine, and told him how the queen was</a>
<a id='line_15506'>led away with Sir Launcelot, and nigh a twenty-four knights slain. O</a>
<a id='line_15507'>Jesu defend my brethren, said Sir Gawaine, for full well wist I that</a>
<a id='line_15508'>Sir Launcelot would rescue her, outher else he would die in that field;</a>
<a id='line_15509'>and to say the truth he had not been a man of worship had he not</a>
<a id='line_15510'>rescued the queen that day, insomuch she should have been brent for his</a>
<a id='line_15511'>sake. And as in that, said Sir Gawaine, he hath done but knightly, and</a>
<a id='line_15512'>as I would have done myself an I had stood in like case. But where are</a>
<a id='line_15513'>my brethren? said Sir Gawaine, I marvel I hear not of them. Truly, said</a>
<a id='line_15514'>that man, Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris be slain. Jesu defend, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15515'>Gawaine, for all the world I would not that they were slain, and in</a>
<a id='line_15516'>especial my good brother, Sir Gareth. Sir, said the man, he is slain,</a>
<a id='line_15517'>and that is great pity. Who slew him? said Sir Gawaine. Sir, said the</a>
<a id='line_15518'>man, Launcelot slew them both. That may I not believe, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15519'>Gawaine, that ever he slew my brother, Sir Gareth; for I dare say my</a>
<a id='line_15520'>brother Gareth loved him better than me, and all his brethren, and the</a>
<a id='line_15521'>king both. Also I dare say, an Sir Launcelot had desired my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_15522'>Gareth, with him he would have been with him against the king and us</a>
<a id='line_15523'>all, and therefore I may never believe that Sir Launcelot slew my</a>
<a id='line_15524'>brother. Sir, said this man, it is noised that he slew him.</a>

<a id='line_15529'>CHAPTER X. How King Arthur at the request of Sir Gawaine concluded to</a>
<a id='line_15530'>make war against Sir Launcelot, and laid siege to his castle called</a>
<a id='line_15531'>Joyous Gard.</a>
<a id='line_15532'></a>
<a id='line_15533'></a>
<a id='line_15534'>Alas, said Sir Gawaine, now is my joy gone. And then he fell down and</a>
<a id='line_15535'>swooned, and long he lay there as he had been dead. And then, when he</a>
<a id='line_15536'>arose of his swoon, he cried out sorrowfully, and said: Alas! And right</a>
<a id='line_15537'>so Sir Gawaine ran to the king, crying and weeping: O King Arthur, mine</a>
<a id='line_15538'>uncle, my good brother Sir Gareth is slain, and so is my brother Sir</a>
<a id='line_15539'>Gaheris, the which were two noble knights. Then the king wept, and he</a>
<a id='line_15540'>both; and so they fell a-swooning. And when they were revived then</a>
<a id='line_15541'>spake Sir Gawaine: Sir, I will go see my brother, Sir Gareth. Ye may</a>
<a id='line_15542'>not see him, said the king, for I caused him to be interred, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15543'>Gaheris both; for I well understood that ye would make over-much</a>
<a id='line_15544'>sorrow, and the sight of Sir Gareth should have caused your double</a>
<a id='line_15545'>sorrow. Alas, my lord, said Sir Gawaine, how slew he my brother, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15546'>Gareth? Mine own good lord I pray you tell me. Truly, said the king, I</a>
<a id='line_15547'>shall tell you how it is told me, Sir Launcelot slew him and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15548'>Gaheris both. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, they bare none arms against him,</a>
<a id='line_15549'>neither of them both. I wot not how it was, said the king, but as it is</a>
<a id='line_15550'>said, Sir Launcelot slew them both in the thickest of the press and</a>
<a id='line_15551'>knew them not; and therefore let us shape a remedy for to revenge their</a>
<a id='line_15552'>deaths.</a>
<a id='line_15553'></a>
<a id='line_15554'>My king, my lord, and mine uncle, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well now I</a>
<a id='line_15555'>shall make you a promise that I shall hold by my knighthood, that from</a>
<a id='line_15556'>this day I shall never fail Sir Launcelot until the one of us have</a>
<a id='line_15557'>slain the other. And therefore I require you, my lord and king, dress</a>
<a id='line_15558'>you to the war, for wit you well I will be revenged upon Sir Launcelot;</a>
<a id='line_15559'>and therefore, as ye will have my service and my love, now haste you</a>
<a id='line_15560'>thereto, and assay your friends. For I promise unto God, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15561'>Gawaine, for the death of my brother, Sir Gareth, I shall seek Sir</a>
<a id='line_15562'>Launcelot throughout seven kings’ realms, but I shall slay him or else</a>
<a id='line_15563'>he shall slay me. Ye shall not need to seek him so far, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_15564'>for as I hear say, Sir Launcelot will abide me and you in the Joyous</a>
<a id='line_15565'>Gard; and much people draweth unto him, as I hear say. That may I</a>
<a id='line_15566'>believe, said Sir Gawaine; but my lord, he said, assay your friends,</a>
<a id='line_15567'>and I will assay mine. It shall be done, said the king, and as I</a>
<a id='line_15568'>suppose I shall be big enough to draw him out of the biggest tower of</a>
<a id='line_15569'>his castle.</a>
<a id='line_15570'></a>
<a id='line_15571'>So then the king sent letters and writs throughout all England, both in</a>
<a id='line_15572'>the length and the breadth, for to assummon all his knights. And so</a>
<a id='line_15573'>unto Arthur drew many knights, dukes, and earls, so that he had a great</a>
<a id='line_15574'>host. And when they were assembled, the king informed them how Sir</a>
<a id='line_15575'>Launcelot had bereft him his queen. Then the king and all his host made</a>
<a id='line_15576'>them ready to lay siege about Sir Launcelot, where he lay within Joyous</a>
<a id='line_15577'>Gard. Thereof heard Sir Launcelot, and purveyed him of many good</a>
<a id='line_15578'>knights, for with him held many knights; and some for his own sake, and</a>
<a id='line_15579'>some for the queen’s sake. Thus they were on both parties well</a>
<a id='line_15580'>furnished and garnished of all manner of thing that longed to the war.</a>
<a id='line_15581'>But King Arthur’s host was so big that Sir Launcelot would not abide</a>
<a id='line_15582'>him in the field, for he was full loath to do battle against the king;</a>
<a id='line_15583'>but Sir Launcelot drew him to his strong castle with all manner of</a>
<a id='line_15584'>victual, and as many noble men as he might suffice within the town and</a>
<a id='line_15585'>the castle. Then came King Arthur with Sir Gawaine with an huge host,</a>
<a id='line_15586'>and laid a siege all about Joyous Gard, both at the town and at the</a>
<a id='line_15587'>castle, and there they made strong war on both parties. But in no wise</a>
<a id='line_15588'>Sir Launcelot would ride out, nor go out of his castle, of long time;</a>
<a id='line_15589'>neither he would none of his good knights to issue out, neither none of</a>
<a id='line_15590'>the town nor of the castle, until fifteen weeks were past.</a>
<a id='line_15591'></a>

<a id='line_15594'></a>
<a id='line_15595'>CHAPTER XI. Of the communication between King Arthur and Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15596'>and how King Arthur reproved him.</a>
<a id='line_15597'></a>
<a id='line_15598'></a>
<a id='line_15599'>Then it befell upon a day in harvest time, Sir Launcelot looked over</a>
<a id='line_15600'>the walls, and spake on high unto King Arthur and Sir Gawaine: My lords</a>
<a id='line_15601'>both, wit ye well all is in vain that ye make at this siege, for here</a>
<a id='line_15602'>win ye no worship but maugre and dishonour; for an it list me to come</a>
<a id='line_15603'>myself out and my good knights, I should full soon make an end of this</a>
<a id='line_15604'>war. Come forth, said Arthur unto Launcelot, an thou durst, and I</a>
<a id='line_15605'>promise thee I shall meet thee in midst of the field. God defend me,</a>
<a id='line_15606'>said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should encounter with the most noble</a>
<a id='line_15607'>king that made me knight. Fie upon thy fair language, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_15608'>for wit you well and trust it, I am thy mortal foe, and ever will to my</a>
<a id='line_15609'>death day; for thou hast slain my good knights, and full noble men of</a>
<a id='line_15610'>my blood, that I shall never recover again. Also thou hast lain by my</a>
<a id='line_15611'>queen, and holden her many winters, and sithen like a traitor taken her</a>
<a id='line_15612'>from me by force.</a>
<a id='line_15613'></a>
<a id='line_15614'>My most noble lord and king, said Sir Launcelot, ye may say what ye</a>
<a id='line_15615'>will, for ye wot well with yourself will I not strive; but thereas ye</a>
<a id='line_15616'>say I have slain your good knights, I wot well that I have done so, and</a>
<a id='line_15617'>that me sore repenteth; but I was enforced to do battle with them in</a>
<a id='line_15618'>saving of my life, or else I must have suffered them to have slain me.</a>
<a id='line_15619'>And as for my lady, Queen Guenever, except your person of your</a>
<a id='line_15620'>highness, and my lord Sir Gawaine, there is no knight under heaven that</a>
<a id='line_15621'>dare make it good upon me, that ever I was a traitor unto your person.</a>
<a id='line_15622'>And where it please you to say that I have holden my lady your queen</a>
<a id='line_15623'>years and winters, unto that I shall ever make a large answer, and</a>
<a id='line_15624'>prove it upon any knight that beareth the life, except your person and</a>
<a id='line_15625'>Sir Gawaine, that my lady, Queen Guenever, is a true lady unto your</a>
<a id='line_15626'>person as any is living unto her lord, and that will I make good with</a>
<a id='line_15627'>my hands. Howbeit it hath liked her good grace to have me in chierte,</a>
<a id='line_15628'>and to cherish me more than any other knight; and unto my power I again</a>
<a id='line_15629'>have deserved her love, for ofttimes, my lord, ye have consented that</a>
<a id='line_15630'>she should be brent and destroyed, in your heat, and then it fortuned</a>
<a id='line_15631'>me to do battle for her, and or I departed from her adversary they</a>
<a id='line_15632'>confessed their untruth, and she full worshipfully excused. And at such</a>
<a id='line_15633'>times, my lord Arthur, said Sir Launcelot, ye loved me, and thanked me</a>
<a id='line_15634'>when I saved your queen from the fire; and then ye promised me for ever</a>
<a id='line_15635'>to be my good lord; and now methinketh ye reward me full ill for my</a>
<a id='line_15636'>good service. And my good lord, meseemeth I had lost a great part of my</a>
<a id='line_15637'>worship in my knighthood an I had suffered my lady, your queen, to have</a>
<a id='line_15638'>been brent, and insomuch she should have been brent for my sake. For</a>
<a id='line_15639'>sithen I have done battles for your queen in other quarrels than in</a>
<a id='line_15640'>mine own, meseemeth now I had more right to do battle for her in right</a>
<a id='line_15641'>quarrel. And therefore my good and gracious lord, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15642'>take your queen unto your good grace, for she is both fair, true, and</a>
<a id='line_15643'>good.</a>
<a id='line_15644'></a>
<a id='line_15645'>Fie on thee, false recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine; I let thee wit my</a>
<a id='line_15646'>lord, mine uncle, King Arthur, shall have his queen and thee, maugre</a>
<a id='line_15647'>thy visage, and slay you both whether it please him. It may well be,</a>
<a id='line_15648'>said Sir Launcelot, but wit you well, my lord Sir Gawaine, an me list</a>
<a id='line_15649'>to come out of this castle ye should win me and the queen more harder</a>
<a id='line_15650'>than ever ye won a strong battle. Fie on thy proud words, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15651'>Gawaine; as for my lady, the queen, I will never say of her shame. But</a>
<a id='line_15652'>thou, false and recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine, what cause hadst</a>
<a id='line_15653'>thou to slay my good brother Sir Gareth, that loved thee more than all</a>
<a id='line_15654'>my kin? Alas thou madest him knight thine own hands; why slew thou him</a>
<a id='line_15655'>that loved thee so well? For to excuse me, said Sir Launcelot, it</a>
<a id='line_15656'>helpeth me not, but by Jesu, and by the faith that I owe to the high</a>
<a id='line_15657'>order of knighthood, I should with as good will have slain my nephew,</a>
<a id='line_15658'>Sir Bors de Ganis, at that time. But alas that ever I was so unhappy,</a>
<a id='line_15659'>said Launcelot, that I had not seen Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris.</a>
<a id='line_15660'></a>
<a id='line_15661'>Thou liest, recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine, thou slewest him in</a>
<a id='line_15662'>despite of me; and therefore, wit thou well I shall make war to thee,</a>
<a id='line_15663'>and all the while that I may live. That me repenteth, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15664'>Launcelot; for well I understand it helpeth not to seek none accordment</a>
<a id='line_15665'>while ye, Sir Gawaine, are so mischievously set. And if ye were not, I</a>
<a id='line_15666'>would not doubt to have the good grace of my lord Arthur. I believe it</a>
<a id='line_15667'>well, false recreant knight, said Sir Gawaine; for thou hast many long</a>
<a id='line_15668'>days overled me and us all, and destroyed many of our good knights. Ye</a>
<a id='line_15669'>say as it pleaseth you, said Sir Launcelot; and yet may it never be</a>
<a id='line_15670'>said on me, and openly proved, that ever I by forecast of treason slew</a>
<a id='line_15671'>no good knight, as my lord, Sir Gawaine, ye have done; and so did I</a>
<a id='line_15672'>never, but in my defence that I was driven thereto, in saving of my</a>
<a id='line_15673'>life. Ah, false knight, said Sir Gawaine, that thou meanest by Sir</a>
<a id='line_15674'>Lamorak: wit thou well I slew him. Ye slew him not yourself, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15675'>Launcelot; it had been overmuch on hand for you to have slain him, for</a>
<a id='line_15676'>he was one of the best knights christened of his age, and it was great</a>
<a id='line_15677'>pity of his death.</a>
<a id='line_15678'></a>
<a id='line_15679'></a>
<a id='line_15680'></a>
<a id='line_15681'></a>
<a id='line_15682'>CHAPTER XII. How the cousins and kinsmen of Sir Launcelot excited him</a>
<a id='line_15683'>to go out to battle, and how they made them ready.</a>
<a id='line_15684'></a>
<a id='line_15685'></a>
<a id='line_15686'>Well, well, said Sir Gawaine to Launcelot, sithen thou enbraidest me of</a>
<a id='line_15687'>Sir Lamorak, wit thou well I shall never leave thee till I have thee at</a>
<a id='line_15688'>such avail that thou shalt not escape my hands. I trust you well</a>
<a id='line_15689'>enough, said Sir Launcelot, an ye may get me I get but little mercy.</a>
<a id='line_15690'>But as the French book saith, the noble King Arthur would have taken</a>
<a id='line_15691'>his queen again, and have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_15692'>Gawaine would not suffer him by no manner of mean. And then Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_15693'>made many men to blow upon Sir Launcelot; and all at once they called</a>
<a id='line_15694'>him false recreant knight.</a>
<a id='line_15695'></a>
<a id='line_15696'>Then when Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Lionel, heard</a>
<a id='line_15697'>this outcry, they called to them Sir Palomides, Sir Safere’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_15698'>and Sir Lavaine, with many more of their blood, and all they went unto</a>
<a id='line_15699'>Sir Launcelot, and said thus: My lord Sir Launcelot, wit ye well we</a>
<a id='line_15700'>have great scorn of the great rebukes that we heard Gawaine say to you;</a>
<a id='line_15701'>wherefore we pray you, and charge you as ye will have our service, keep</a>
<a id='line_15702'>us no longer within these walls; for wit you well plainly, we will ride</a>
<a id='line_15703'>into the field and do battle with them; for ye fare as a man that were</a>
<a id='line_15704'>afeard, and for all your fair speech it will not avail you. For wit you</a>
<a id='line_15705'>well Sir Gawaine will not suffer you to be accorded with King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_15706'>and therefore fight for your life and your right, an ye dare. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_15707'>said Sir Launcelot, for to ride out of this castle, and to do battle, I</a>
<a id='line_15708'>am full loath.</a>
<a id='line_15709'></a>
<a id='line_15710'>Then Sir Launcelot spake on high unto Sir Arthur and Sir Gawaine: My</a>
<a id='line_15711'>lords, I require you and beseech you, sithen that I am thus required</a>
<a id='line_15712'>and conjured to ride into the field, that neither you, my lord King</a>
<a id='line_15713'>Arthur, nor you Sir Gawaine, come not into the field. What shall we do</a>
<a id='line_15714'>then? said Sir Gawaine, [N]is this the king’s quarrel with thee to</a>
<a id='line_15715'>fight? and it is my quarrel to fight with thee, Sir Launcelot, because</a>
<a id='line_15716'>of the death of my brother Sir Gareth. Then must I needs unto battle,</a>
<a id='line_15717'>said Sir Launcelot. Now wit you well, my lord Arthur and Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_15718'>ye will repent it whensomever I do battle with you.</a>
<a id='line_15719'></a>
<a id='line_15720'>And so then they departed either from other; and then either party made</a>
<a id='line_15721'>them ready on the morn for to do battle, and great purveyance was made</a>
<a id='line_15722'>on both sides; and Sir Gawaine let purvey many knights for to wait upon</a>
<a id='line_15723'>Sir Launcelot, for to overset him and to slay him. And on the morn at</a>
<a id='line_15724'>underne Sir Arthur was ready in the field with three great hosts. And</a>
<a id='line_15725'>then Sir Launcelot’s fellowship came out at three gates, in a full good</a>
<a id='line_15726'>array; and Sir Lionel came in the foremost battle, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15727'>came in the middle, and Sir Bors came out at the third gate. Thus they</a>
<a id='line_15728'>came in order and rule, as full noble knights; and always Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15729'>charged all his knights in any wise to save King Arthur and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15730'>Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_15731'></a>
<a id='line_15732'></a>
<a id='line_15733'></a>
<a id='line_15734'></a>
<a id='line_15735'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Gawaine jousted and smote down Sir Lionel, and</a>
<a id='line_15736'>how Sir Launcelot horsed King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_15737'></a>
<a id='line_15738'></a>
<a id='line_15739'>Then came forth Sir Gawaine from the king’s host, and he came before</a>
<a id='line_15740'>and proffered to joust. And Sir Lionel was a fierce knight, and lightly</a>
<a id='line_15741'>he encountered with Sir Gawaine; and there Sir Gawaine smote Sir Lionel</a>
<a id='line_15742'>through out the body, that he dashed to the earth like as he had been</a>
<a id='line_15743'>dead; and then Sir Ector de Maris and other more bare him into the</a>
<a id='line_15744'>castle. Then there began a great stour, and much people was slain; and</a>
<a id='line_15745'>ever Sir Launcelot did what he might to save the people on King</a>
<a id='line_15746'>Arthur’s party, for Sir Palomides, and Sir Bors, and Sir Safere,</a>
<a id='line_15747'>overthrew many knights, for they were deadly knights. And Sir Blamore</a>
<a id='line_15748'>de Ganis, and Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, with Sir Bellangere le Beuse,</a>
<a id='line_15749'>these six knights did much harm; and ever King Arthur was nigh about</a>
<a id='line_15750'>Sir Launcelot to have slain him, and Sir Launcelot suffered him, and</a>
<a id='line_15751'>would not strike again. So Sir Bors encountered with King Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_15752'>there with a spear Sir Bors smote him down; and so he alighted and drew</a>
<a id='line_15753'>his sword, and said to Sir Launcelot: Shall I make an end of this war?</a>
<a id='line_15754'>and that he meant to have slain King Arthur. Not so hardy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15755'>Launcelot, upon pain of thy head, that thou touch him no more, for I</a>
<a id='line_15756'>will never see that most noble king that made me knight neither slain</a>
<a id='line_15757'>ne shamed. And therewithal Sir Launcelot alighted off his horse and</a>
<a id='line_15758'>took up the king and horsed him again, and said thus: My lord Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_15759'>for God’s love stint this strife, for ye get here no worship, and I</a>
<a id='line_15760'>would do mine utterance, but always I forbear you, and ye nor none of</a>
<a id='line_15761'>yours forbeareth me; my lord, remember what I have done in many places,</a>
<a id='line_15762'>and now I am evil rewarded.</a>
<a id='line_15763'></a>
<a id='line_15764'>Then when King Arthur was on horseback, he looked upon Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15765'>and then the tears brast out of his eyen, thinking on the great</a>
<a id='line_15766'>courtesy that was in Sir Launcelot more than in any other man; and</a>
<a id='line_15767'>therewith the king rode his way, and might no longer behold him, and</a>
<a id='line_15768'>said: Alas, that ever this war began. And then either parties of the</a>
<a id='line_15769'>battles withdrew them to repose them, and buried the dead, and to the</a>
<a id='line_15770'>wounded men they laid soft salves; and thus they endured that night</a>
<a id='line_15771'>till on the morn. And on the morn by underne they made them ready to do</a>
<a id='line_15772'>battle. And then Sir Bors led the forward.</a>
<a id='line_15773'></a>
<a id='line_15774'>So upon the morn there came Sir Gawaine as brim as any boar, with a</a>
<a id='line_15775'>great spear in his hand. And when Sir Bors saw him he thought to</a>
<a id='line_15776'>revenge his brother Sir Lionel of the despite that Sir Gawaine did him</a>
<a id='line_15777'>the other day. And so they that knew either other feutred their spears,</a>
<a id='line_15778'>and with all their mights of their horses and themselves, they met</a>
<a id='line_15779'>together so felonously that either bare other through, and so they fell</a>
<a id='line_15780'>both to the earth; and then the battles joined, and there was much</a>
<a id='line_15781'>slaughter on both parties. Then Sir Launcelot rescued Sir Bors, and</a>
<a id='line_15782'>sent him into the castle; but neither Sir Gawaine nor Sir Bors died not</a>
<a id='line_15783'>of their wounds, for they were all holpen. Then Sir Lavaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15784'>Urre prayed Sir Launcelot to do his pain, and fight as they had done;</a>
<a id='line_15785'>For we see ye forbear and spare, and that doth much harm; therefore we</a>
<a id='line_15786'>pray you spare not your enemies no more than they do you. Alas, said</a>
<a id='line_15787'>Sir Launcelot, I have no heart to fight against my lord Arthur, for</a>
<a id='line_15788'>ever meseemeth I do not as I ought to do. My lord, said Sir Palomides,</a>
<a id='line_15789'>though ye spare them all this day they will never con you thank; and if</a>
<a id='line_15790'>they may get you at avail ye are but dead. So then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15791'>understood that they said him truth; and then he strained himself more</a>
<a id='line_15792'>than he did aforehand, and because his nephew Sir Bors was sore</a>
<a id='line_15793'>wounded. And then within a little while, by evensong time, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15794'>Launcelot and his party better stood, for their horses went in blood</a>
<a id='line_15795'>past the fetlocks, there was so much people slain. And then for pity</a>
<a id='line_15796'>Sir Launcelot withheld his knights, and suffered King Arthur’s party</a>
<a id='line_15797'>for to withdraw them aside. And then Sir Launcelot’s party withdrew</a>
<a id='line_15798'>them into his castle, and either parties buried the dead, and put salve</a>
<a id='line_15799'>unto the wounded men.</a>
<a id='line_15800'></a>
<a id='line_15801'>So when Sir Gawaine was hurt, they on King Arthur’s party were not so</a>
<a id='line_15802'>orgulous as they were toforehand to do battle. Of this war was noised</a>
<a id='line_15803'>through all Christendom, and at the last it was noised afore the Pope;</a>
<a id='line_15804'>and he considering the great goodness of King Arthur, and of Sir</a>
<a id='line_15805'>Launcelot, that was called the most noblest knights of the world,</a>
<a id='line_15806'>wherefore the Pope called unto him a noble clerk that at that time was</a>
<a id='line_15807'>there present; the French book saith, it was the Bishop of Rochester;</a>
<a id='line_15808'>and the Pope gave him bulls under lead unto King Arthur of England,</a>
<a id='line_15809'>charging him upon pain of interdicting of all England, that he take his</a>
<a id='line_15810'>queen Dame Guenever unto him again, and accord with Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_15811'></a>

<a id='line_15814'></a>
<a id='line_15815'>CHAPTER XIV. How the Pope sent down his bulls to make peace, and how</a>
<a id='line_15816'>Sir Launcelot brought the queen to King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_15817'></a>
<a id='line_15818'></a>
<a id='line_15819'>So when this Bishop was come to Carlisle he shewed the king these</a>
<a id='line_15820'>bulls. And when the king understood these bulls he nist what to do:</a>
<a id='line_15821'>full fain he would have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir</a>
<a id='line_15822'>Gawaine would not suffer him; but as for to have the queen, thereto he</a>
<a id='line_15823'>agreed. But in nowise Sir Gawaine would not suffer the king to accord</a>
<a id='line_15824'>with Sir Launcelot; but as for the queen he consented. And then the</a>
<a id='line_15825'>Bishop had of the king his great seal, and his assurance as he was a</a>
<a id='line_15826'>true anointed king that Sir Launcelot should come safe, and go safe,</a>
<a id='line_15827'>and that the queen should not be spoken unto of the king, nor of none</a>
<a id='line_15828'>other, for no thing done afore time past; and of all these appointments</a>
<a id='line_15829'>the Bishop brought with him sure assurance and writing, to shew Sir</a>
<a id='line_15830'>Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_15831'></a>
<a id='line_15832'>So when the Bishop was come to Joyous Gard, there he shewed Sir</a>
<a id='line_15833'>Launcelot how the Pope had written to Arthur and unto him, and there he</a>
<a id='line_15834'>told him the perils if he withheld the queen from the king. It was</a>
<a id='line_15835'>never in my thought, said Launcelot, to withhold the queen from my lord</a>
<a id='line_15836'>Arthur; but, insomuch she should have been dead for my sake, meseemeth</a>
<a id='line_15837'>it was my part to save her life, and put her from that danger, till</a>
<a id='line_15838'>better recover might come. And now I thank God, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15839'>that the Pope hath made her peace; for God knoweth, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_15840'>I will be a thousandfold more gladder to bring her again, than ever I</a>
<a id='line_15841'>was of her taking away; with this, I may be sure to come safe and go</a>
<a id='line_15842'>safe, and that the queen shall have her liberty as she had before; and</a>
<a id='line_15843'>never for no thing that hath been surmised afore this time, she never</a>
<a id='line_15844'>from this day stand in no peril. For else, said Sir Launcelot, I dare</a>
<a id='line_15845'>adventure me to keep her from an harder shour than ever I kept her. It</a>
<a id='line_15846'>shall not need you, said the Bishop, to dread so much; for wit you</a>
<a id='line_15847'>well, the Pope must be obeyed, and it were not the Pope’s worship nor</a>
<a id='line_15848'>my poor honesty to wit you distressed, neither the queen, neither in</a>
<a id='line_15849'>peril, nor shamed. And then he shewed Sir Launcelot all his writing,</a>
<a id='line_15850'>both from the Pope and from King Arthur. This is sure enough, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15851'>Launcelot, for full well I dare trust my lord’s own writing and his</a>
<a id='line_15852'>seal, for he was never shamed of his promise. Therefore, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15853'>Launcelot unto the Bishop, ye shall ride unto the king afore, and</a>
<a id='line_15854'>recommend me unto his good grace, and let him have knowledging that</a>
<a id='line_15855'>this same day eight days, by the grace of God, I myself shall bring my</a>
<a id='line_15856'>lady, Queen Guenever, unto him. And then say ye unto my most redoubted</a>
<a id='line_15857'>king, that I will say largely for the queen, that I shall none except</a>
<a id='line_15858'>for dread nor fear, but the king himself, and my lord Sir Gawaine; and</a>
<a id='line_15859'>that is more for the king’s love than for himself.</a>
<a id='line_15860'></a>
<a id='line_15861'>So the Bishop departed and came to the king at Carlisle, and told him</a>
<a id='line_15862'>all how Sir Launcelot answered him; and then the tears brast out of the</a>
<a id='line_15863'>king’s eyen. Then Sir Launcelot purveyed him an hundred knights, and</a>
<a id='line_15864'>all were clothed in green velvet, and their horses trapped to their</a>
<a id='line_15865'>heels; and every knight held a branch of olive in his hand, in tokening</a>
<a id='line_15866'>of peace. And the queen had four-and-twenty gentlewomen following her</a>
<a id='line_15867'>in the same wise; and Sir Launcelot had twelve coursers following him,</a>
<a id='line_15868'>and on every courser sat a young gentleman, and all they were arrayed</a>
<a id='line_15869'>in green velvet, with sarps of gold about their quarters, and the horse</a>
<a id='line_15870'>trapped in the same wise down to the heels, with many ouches, y-set</a>
<a id='line_15871'>with stones and pearls in gold, to the number of a thousand. And she</a>
<a id='line_15872'>and Sir Launcelot were clothed in white cloth of gold tissue; and right</a>
<a id='line_15873'>so as ye have heard, as the French book maketh mention, he rode with</a>
<a id='line_15874'>the queen from Joyous Gard to Carlisle. And so Sir Launcelot rode</a>
<a id='line_15875'>throughout Carlisle, and so in the castle, that all men might behold;</a>
<a id='line_15876'>and wit you well there was many a weeping eye. And then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_15877'>himself alighted and avoided his horse, and took the queen, and so led</a>
<a id='line_15878'>her where King Arthur was in his seat: and Sir Gawaine sat afore him,</a>
<a id='line_15879'>and many other great lords. So when Sir Launcelot saw the king and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15880'>Gawaine, then he led the queen by the arm, and then he kneeled down,</a>
<a id='line_15881'>and the queen both. Wit you well then was there many bold knight there</a>
<a id='line_15882'>with King Arthur that wept as tenderly as though they had seen all</a>
<a id='line_15883'>their kin afore them. So the king sat still, and said no word. And when</a>
<a id='line_15884'>Sir Launcelot saw his countenance, he arose and pulled up the queen</a>
<a id='line_15885'>with him, and thus he spake full knightly.</a>

<a id='line_15890'>CHAPTER XV. Of the deliverance of the queen to the king by Sir</a>
<a id='line_15891'>Launcelot, and what language Sir Gawaine had to Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_15892'></a>
<a id='line_15893'></a>
<a id='line_15894'>My most redoubted king, ye shall understand, by the Pope’s commandment</a>
<a id='line_15895'>and yours, I have brought to you my lady the queen, as right requireth;</a>
<a id='line_15896'>and if there be any knight, of whatsomever degree that he be, except</a>
<a id='line_15897'>your person, that will say or dare say but that she is true and clean</a>
<a id='line_15898'>to you, I here myself, Sir Launcelot du Lake, will make it good upon</a>
<a id='line_15899'>his body, that she is a true lady unto you; but liars ye have listened,</a>
<a id='line_15900'>and that hath caused debate betwixt you and me. For time hath been, my</a>
<a id='line_15901'>lord Arthur, that ye have been greatly pleased with me when I did</a>
<a id='line_15902'>battle for my lady, your queen; and full well ye know, my most noble</a>
<a id='line_15903'>king, that she hath been put to great wrong or this time; and sithen it</a>
<a id='line_15904'>pleased you at many times that I should fight for her, meseemeth, my</a>
<a id='line_15905'>good lord, I had more cause to rescue her from the fire, insomuch she</a>
<a id='line_15906'>should have been brent for my sake. For they that told you those tales</a>
<a id='line_15907'>were liars, and so it fell upon them; for by likelihood had not the</a>
<a id='line_15908'>might of God been with me, I might never have endured fourteen knights,</a>
<a id='line_15909'>and they armed and afore purposed, and I unarmed and not purposed. For</a>
<a id='line_15910'>I was sent for unto my lady your queen, I wot not for what cause; but I</a>
<a id='line_15911'>was not so soon within the chamber door, but anon Sir Agravaine and Sir</a>
<a id='line_15912'>Mordred called me traitor and recreant knight. They called thee right,</a>
<a id='line_15913'>said Sir Gawaine. My lord Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot, in their</a>
<a id='line_15914'>quarrel they proved themselves not in the right. Well well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15915'>Launcelot, said the king, I have given thee no cause to do to me as</a>
<a id='line_15916'>thou hast done, for I have worshipped thee and thine more than any of</a>
<a id='line_15917'>all my knights.</a>
<a id='line_15918'></a>
<a id='line_15919'>My good lord, said Sir Launcelot, so ye be not displeased, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_15920'>understand I and mine have done you oft better service than any other</a>
<a id='line_15921'>knights have done, in many divers places; and where ye have been full</a>
<a id='line_15922'>hard bestead divers times, I have myself rescued you from many dangers;</a>
<a id='line_15923'>and ever unto my power I was glad to please you, and my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_15924'>Gawaine; both in jousts, and tournaments, and in battles set, both on</a>
<a id='line_15925'>horseback and on foot, I have often rescued you, and my lord Sir</a>
<a id='line_15926'>Gawaine, and many mo of your knights in many divers places. For now I</a>
<a id='line_15927'>will make avaunt, said Sir Launcelot, I will that ye all wit that yet I</a>
<a id='line_15928'>found never no manner of knight but that I was overhard for him, an I</a>
<a id='line_15929'>had done my utterance, thanked be God; howbeit I have been matched with</a>
<a id='line_15930'>good knights, as Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak, but ever I had a favour</a>
<a id='line_15931'>unto them and a deeming what they were. And I take God to record, said</a>
<a id='line_15932'>Sir Launcelot, I never was wroth nor greatly heavy with no good knight</a>
<a id='line_15933'>an I saw him busy about to win worship; and glad I was ever when I</a>
<a id='line_15934'>found any knight that might endure me on horseback and on foot: howbeit</a>
<a id='line_15935'>Sir Carados of the Dolorous Tower was a full noble knight and a passing</a>
<a id='line_15936'>strong man, and that wot ye, my lord Sir Gawaine; for he might well be</a>
<a id='line_15937'>called a noble knight when he by fine force pulled you out of your</a>
<a id='line_15938'>saddle, and bound you overthwart afore him to his saddle bow; and</a>
<a id='line_15939'>there, my lord Sir Gawaine, I rescued you, and slew him afore your</a>
<a id='line_15940'>sight. Also I found his brother, Sir Turquin, in likewise leading Sir</a>
<a id='line_15941'>Gaheris, your brother, bounden afore him; and there I rescued your</a>
<a id='line_15942'>brother and slew that Turquin, and delivered three-score-and-four of my</a>
<a id='line_15943'>lord Arthur’s knights out of his prison. And now I dare say, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15944'>Launcelot, I met never with so strong knights, nor so well fighting, as</a>
<a id='line_15945'>was Sir Carados and Sir Turquin, for I fought with them to the</a>
<a id='line_15946'>uttermost. And therefore, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_15947'>meseemeth ye ought of right to remember this; for, an I might have your</a>
<a id='line_15948'>good will, I would trust to God to have my lord Arthur’s good grace.</a>

<a id='line_15955'></a>
<a id='line_15956'></a>
<a id='line_15957'>The king may do as he will, said Sir Gawaine, but wit thou well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_15958'>Launcelot, thou and I shall never be accorded while we live, for thou</a>
<a id='line_15959'>hast slain three of my brethren; and two of them ye slew traitorly and</a>
<a id='line_15960'>piteously, for they bare none harness against thee, nor none would</a>
<a id='line_15961'>bear. God would they had been armed, said Sir Launcelot, for then had</a>
<a id='line_15962'>they been alive. And wit ye well Sir Gawaine, as for Sir Gareth, I love</a>
<a id='line_15963'>none of my kinsmen so much as I did him; and ever while I live, said</a>
<a id='line_15964'>Sir Launcelot, I will bewail Sir Gareth’s death, not all only for the</a>
<a id='line_15965'>great fear I have of you, but many causes cause me to be sorrowful. One</a>
<a id='line_15966'>is, for I made him knight; another is, I wot well he loved me above all</a>
<a id='line_15967'>other knights; and the third is, he was passing noble, true, courteous,</a>
<a id='line_15968'>and gentle, and well conditioned; the fourth is, I wist well, anon as I</a>
<a id='line_15969'>heard that Sir Gareth was dead, I should never after have your love,</a>
<a id='line_15970'>but everlasting war betwixt us; and also I wist well that ye would</a>
<a id='line_15971'>cause my noble lord Arthur for ever to be my mortal foe. And as Jesu be</a>
<a id='line_15972'>my help, said Sir Launcelot, I slew never Sir Gareth nor Sir Gaheris by</a>
<a id='line_15973'>my will; but alas that ever they were unarmed that unhappy day. But</a>
<a id='line_15974'>thus much I shall offer me, said Sir Launcelot, if it may please the</a>
<a id='line_15975'>king’s good grace, and you, my lord Sir Gawaine, I shall first begin at</a>
<a id='line_15976'>Sandwich, and there I shall go in my shirt, barefoot; and at every ten</a>
<a id='line_15977'>miles’ end I will found and gar make an house of religion, of what</a>
<a id='line_15978'>order that ye will assign me, with an whole convent, to sing and read,</a>
<a id='line_15979'>day and night, in especial for Sir Gareth’s sake and Sir Gaheris. And</a>
<a id='line_15980'>this shall I perform from Sandwich unto Carlisle; and every house shall</a>
<a id='line_15981'>have sufficient livelihood. And this shall I perform while I have any</a>
<a id='line_15982'>livelihood in Christendom; and there nis none of all these religious</a>
<a id='line_15983'>places, but they shall be performed, furnished and garnished in all</a>
<a id='line_15984'>things as an holy place ought to be, I promise you faithfully. And</a>
<a id='line_15985'>this, Sir Gawaine, methinketh were more fairer, holier, and more better</a>
<a id='line_15986'>to their souls, than ye, my most noble king, and you, Sir Gawaine, to</a>
<a id='line_15987'>war upon me, for thereby shall ye get none avail.</a>
<a id='line_15988'></a>
<a id='line_15989'>Then all knights and ladies that were there wept as they were mad, and</a>
<a id='line_15990'>the tears fell on King Arthur’s cheeks. Sir Launcelot, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_15991'>Gawaine, I have right well heard thy speech, and thy great proffers,</a>
<a id='line_15992'>but wit thou well, let the king do as it pleased him, I will never</a>
<a id='line_15993'>forgive my brothers’ death, and in especial the death of my brother,</a>
<a id='line_15994'>Sir Gareth. And if mine uncle, King Arthur, will accord with thee, he</a>
<a id='line_15995'>shall lose my service, for wit thou well thou art both false to the</a>
<a id='line_15996'>king and to me. Sir, said Launcelot, he beareth not the life that may</a>
<a id='line_15997'>make that good; and if ye, Sir Gawaine, will charge me with so high a</a>
<a id='line_15998'>thing, ye must pardon me, for then needs must I answer you. Nay, said</a>
<a id='line_15999'>Sir Gawaine, we are past that at this time, and that caused the Pope,</a>
<a id='line_16000'>for he hath charged mine uncle, the king, that he shall take his queen</a>
<a id='line_16001'>again, and to accord with thee, Sir Launcelot, as for this season, and</a>
<a id='line_16002'>therefore thou shalt go safe as thou camest. But in this land thou</a>
<a id='line_16003'>shalt not abide past fifteen days, such summons I give thee: so the</a>
<a id='line_16004'>king and we were consented and accorded or thou camest. And else, said</a>
<a id='line_16005'>Sir Gawaine, wit thou well thou shouldst not have come here, but if it</a>
<a id='line_16006'>were maugre thy head. And if it were not for the Pope’s commandment,</a>
<a id='line_16007'>said Sir Gawaine, I should do battle with mine own body against thy</a>
<a id='line_16008'>body, and prove it upon thee, that thou hast been both false unto mine</a>
<a id='line_16009'>uncle King Arthur, and to me both; and that shall I prove upon thy</a>
<a id='line_16010'>body, when thou art departed from hence, wheresomever I find thee.</a>

<a id='line_16017'></a>
<a id='line_16018'></a>
<a id='line_16019'>Then Sir Launcelot sighed, and therewith the tears fell on his cheeks,</a>
<a id='line_16020'>and then he said thus: Alas, most noble Christian realm, whom I have</a>
<a id='line_16021'>loved above all other realms, and in thee I have gotten a great part of</a>
<a id='line_16022'>my worship, and now I shall depart in this wise. Truly me repenteth</a>
<a id='line_16023'>that ever I came in this realm, that should be thus shamefully</a>
<a id='line_16024'>banished, undeserved and causeless; but fortune is so variant, and the</a>
<a id='line_16025'>wheel so moveable, there nis none constant abiding, and that may be</a>
<a id='line_16026'>proved by many old chronicles, of noble Ector, and Troilus, and</a>
<a id='line_16027'>Alisander, the mighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they were most</a>
<a id='line_16028'>in their royalty, they alighted lowest. And so fareth it by me, said</a>
<a id='line_16029'>Sir Launcelot, for in this realm I had worship, and by me and mine all</a>
<a id='line_16030'>the whole Round Table hath been increased more in worship, by me and</a>
<a id='line_16031'>mine blood, than by any other. And therefore wit thou well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16032'>Gawaine, I may live upon my lands as well as any knight that here is.</a>
<a id='line_16033'>And if ye, most redoubted king, will come upon my lands with Sir</a>
<a id='line_16034'>Gawaine to war upon me, I must endure you as well as I may. But as to</a>
<a id='line_16035'>you, Sir Gawaine, if that ye come there, I pray you charge me not with</a>
<a id='line_16036'>treason nor felony, for an ye do, I must answer you. Do thou thy best,</a>
<a id='line_16037'>said Sir Gawaine; therefore hie thee fast that thou were gone, and wit</a>
<a id='line_16038'>thou well we shall soon come after, and break the strongest castle that</a>
<a id='line_16039'>thou hast, upon thy head. That shall not need, said Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_16040'>an I were as orgulous set as ye are, wit you well I should meet you in</a>
<a id='line_16041'>midst of the field. Make thou no more language, said Sir Gawaine, but</a>
<a id='line_16042'>deliver the queen from thee, and pike thee lightly out of this court.</a>
<a id='line_16043'>Well, said Sir Launcelot, an I had wist of this short coming, I would</a>
<a id='line_16044'>have advised me twice or that I had come hither; for an the queen had</a>
<a id='line_16045'>been so dear to me as ye noise her, I durst have kept her from the</a>
<a id='line_16046'>fellowship of the best knights under heaven.</a>
<a id='line_16047'></a>
<a id='line_16048'>And then Sir Launcelot said unto Guenever, in hearing of the king and</a>
<a id='line_16049'>them all: Madam, now I must depart from you and this noble fellowship</a>
<a id='line_16050'>for ever; and sithen it is so, I beseech you to pray for me, and say me</a>
<a id='line_16051'>well; and if ye be hard bestead by any false tongues, lightly my lady</a>
<a id='line_16052'>send me word, and if any knight’s hands may deliver you by battle, I</a>
<a id='line_16053'>shall deliver you. And therewithal Sir Launcelot kissed the queen; and</a>
<a id='line_16054'>then he said all openly. Now let see what he be in this place that dare</a>
<a id='line_16055'>say the queen is not true unto my lord Arthur, let see who will speak</a>
<a id='line_16056'>an he dare speak. And therewith he brought the queen to the king, and</a>
<a id='line_16057'>then Sir Launcelot took his leave and departed; and there was neither</a>
<a id='line_16058'>king, duke, nor earl, baron nor knight, lady nor gentlewoman, but all</a>
<a id='line_16059'>they wept as people out of their mind, except Sir Gawaine. And when the</a>
<a id='line_16060'>noble Sir Launcelot took his horse to ride out of Carlisle, there was</a>
<a id='line_16061'>sobbing and weeping for pure dole of his departing; and so he took his</a>
<a id='line_16062'>way unto Joyous Gard. And then ever after he called it the Dolorous</a>
<a id='line_16063'>Gard. And thus departed Sir Launcelot from the court for ever.</a>
<a id='line_16064'></a>
<a id='line_16065'>And so when he came to Joyous Gard he called his fellowship unto him,</a>
<a id='line_16066'>and asked them what they would do. Then they answered all wholly</a>
<a id='line_16067'>together with one voice they would as he would do. My fair fellows,</a>
<a id='line_16068'>said Sir Launcelot, I must depart out of this most noble realm, and now</a>
<a id='line_16069'>I shall depart it grieveth me sore, for I shall depart with no worship,</a>
<a id='line_16070'>for a flemed man departed never out of a realm with no worship; and</a>
<a id='line_16071'>that is my heaviness, for ever I fear after my days that men shall</a>
<a id='line_16072'>chronicle upon me that I was flemed out of this land; and else, my fair</a>
<a id='line_16073'>lords, be ye sure, an I had not dread shame, my lady, Queen Guenever,</a>
<a id='line_16074'>and I should never have departed.</a>
<a id='line_16075'></a>
<a id='line_16076'>Then spake many noble knights, as Sir Palomides, Sir Safere his</a>
<a id='line_16077'>brother, and Sir Bellingere le Beuse, and Sir Urre, with Sir Lavaine,</a>
<a id='line_16078'>with many others: Sir, an ye be so disposed to abide in this land we</a>
<a id='line_16079'>will never fail you; and if ye list not to abide in this land there nis</a>
<a id='line_16080'>none of the good knights that here be will fail you, for many causes.</a>
<a id='line_16081'>One is, all we that be not of your blood shall never be welcome to the</a>
<a id='line_16082'>court. And sithen it liked us to take a part with you in your distress</a>
<a id='line_16083'>and heaviness in this realm, wit you well it shall like us as well to</a>
<a id='line_16084'>go in other countries with you, and there to take such part as ye do.</a>
<a id='line_16085'>My fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, I well understand you, and as I can,</a>
<a id='line_16086'>thank you: and ye shall understand, such livelihood as I am born unto I</a>
<a id='line_16087'>shall depart with you in this manner of wise; that is for to say, I</a>
<a id='line_16088'>shall depart all my livelihood and all my lands freely among you, and I</a>
<a id='line_16089'>myself will have as little as any of you, for have I sufficient that</a>
<a id='line_16090'>may long to my person, I will ask none other rich array; and I trust to</a>
<a id='line_16091'>God to maintain you on my lands as well as ever were maintained any</a>
<a id='line_16092'>knights. Then spake all the knights at once: He have shame that will</a>
<a id='line_16093'>leave you; for we all understand in this realm will be now no quiet,</a>
<a id='line_16094'>but ever strife and debate, now the fellowship of the Round Table is</a>
<a id='line_16095'>broken; for by the noble fellowship of the Round Table was King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_16096'>upborne, and by their noblesse the king and all his realm was in quiet</a>
<a id='line_16097'>and rest, and a great part they said all was because of your noblesse.</a>
<a id='line_16098'></a>
<a id='line_16099'></a>
<a id='line_16100'></a>
<a id='line_16101'></a>
<a id='line_16102'>CHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot passed over the sea, and how he made</a>
<a id='line_16103'>great lords of the knights that went with him.</a>
<a id='line_16104'></a>
<a id='line_16105'></a>
<a id='line_16106'>Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I thank you all of your good saying,</a>
<a id='line_16107'>howbeit, I wot well, in me was not all the stability of this realm, but</a>
<a id='line_16108'>in that I might I did my devoir; and well I am sure I knew many</a>
<a id='line_16109'>rebellions in my days that by me were peaced, and I trow we all shall</a>
<a id='line_16110'>hear of them in short space, and that me sore repenteth. For ever I</a>
<a id='line_16111'>dread me, said Sir Launcelot, that Sir Mordred will make trouble, for</a>
<a id='line_16112'>he is passing envious and applieth him to trouble. So they were</a>
<a id='line_16113'>accorded to go with Sir Launcelot to his lands; and to make short tale,</a>
<a id='line_16114'>they trussed, and paid all that would ask them; and wholly an hundred</a>
<a id='line_16115'>knights departed with Sir Launcelot at once, and made their avows they</a>
<a id='line_16116'>would never leave him for weal nor for woe.</a>
<a id='line_16117'></a>
<a id='line_16118'>And so they shipped at Cardiff, and sailed unto Benwick: some men call</a>
<a id='line_16119'>it Bayonne, and some men call it Beaune, where the wine of Beaune is.</a>
<a id='line_16120'>But to say the sooth, Sir Launcelot and his nephews were lords of all</a>
<a id='line_16121'>France, and of all the lands that longed unto France; he and his</a>
<a id='line_16122'>kindred rejoiced it all through Sir Launcelot’s noble prowess. And then</a>
<a id='line_16123'>Sir Launcelot stuffed and furnished and garnished all his noble towns</a>
<a id='line_16124'>and castles. Then all the people of those lands came to Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16125'>on foot and hands. And so when he had stablished all these countries,</a>
<a id='line_16126'>he shortly called a parliament; and there he crowned Sir Lionel, King</a>
<a id='line_16127'>of France; and Sir Bors [he] crowned him king of all King Claudas’</a>
<a id='line_16128'>lands; and Sir Ector de Maris, that was Sir Launcelot’s youngest</a>
<a id='line_16129'>brother, he crowned him King of Benwick, and king of all Guienne, that</a>
<a id='line_16130'>was Sir Launcelot’s own land. And he made Sir Ector prince of them all,</a>
<a id='line_16131'>and thus he departed.</a>
<a id='line_16132'></a>
<a id='line_16133'>Then Sir Launcelot advanced all his noble knights, and first he</a>
<a id='line_16134'>advanced them of his blood; that was Sir Blamore, he made him Duke of</a>
<a id='line_16135'>Limosin in Guienne and Sir Bleoberis he made him Duke of Poictiers, and</a>
<a id='line_16136'>Sir Gahalantine he made him Duke of Querne, and Sir Galihodin he made</a>
<a id='line_16137'>him Duke of Sentonge, and Sir Galihud he made him Earl of Perigot, and</a>
<a id='line_16138'>Sir Menadeuke he made him Earl of Roerge, and Sir Villiars the Valiant</a>
<a id='line_16139'>he made him Earl of Bearn, and Sir Hebes le Renoumes he made him Earl</a>
<a id='line_16140'>of Comange, and Sir Lavaine he made him Earl of Arminak, and Sir Urre</a>
<a id='line_16141'>he made him Earl of Estrake, and Sir Neroneus he made him Earl of</a>
<a id='line_16142'>Pardiak, and Sir Plenorius he made Earl of Foise, and Sir Selises of</a>
<a id='line_16143'>the Dolorous Tower he made him Earl of Masauke, and Sir Melias de Lile</a>
<a id='line_16144'>he made him Earl of Tursauk, and Sir Bellangere le Beuse he made Earl</a>
<a id='line_16145'>of the Launds, and Sir Palomides he made him Duke of the Provence, and</a>
<a id='line_16146'>Sir Safere he made him Duke of Landok, and Sir Clegis he gave him the</a>
<a id='line_16147'>Earldom of Agente, and Sir Sadok he gave the Earldom of Surlat, and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16148'>Dinas le Seneschal he made him Duke of Anjou, and Sir Clarrus he made</a>
<a id='line_16149'>him Duke of Normandy. Thus Sir Launcelot rewarded his noble knights and</a>
<a id='line_16150'>many more, that meseemeth it were too long to rehearse.</a>
<a id='line_16151'></a>
<a id='line_16152'></a>
<a id='line_16153'></a>
<a id='line_16154'></a>
<a id='line_16155'>CHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur and Sir Gawaine made a great host ready to</a>
<a id='line_16156'>go over sea to make war on Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_16157'></a>
<a id='line_16158'></a>
<a id='line_16159'>So leave we Sir Launcelot in his lands, and his noble knights with him,</a>
<a id='line_16160'>and return we again unto King Arthur and to Sir Gawaine, that made a</a>
<a id='line_16161'>great host ready, to the number of threescore thousand; and all thing</a>
<a id='line_16162'>was made ready for their shipping to pass over the sea, and so they</a>
<a id='line_16163'>shipped at Cardiff. And there King Arthur made Sir Mordred chief ruler</a>
<a id='line_16164'>of all England, and also he put Queen Guenever under his governance;</a>
<a id='line_16165'>because Sir Mordred was King Arthur’s son, he gave him the rule of his</a>
<a id='line_16166'>land and of his wife; and so the king passed the sea and landed upon</a>
<a id='line_16167'>Sir Launcelot’s lands, and there he brent and wasted, through the</a>
<a id='line_16168'>vengeance of Sir Gawaine, all that they might overrun.</a>
<a id='line_16169'></a>
<a id='line_16170'>When this word came to Sir Launcelot, that King Arthur and Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_16171'>were landed upon his lands, and made a full great destruction and</a>
<a id='line_16172'>waste, then spake Sir Bors, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, it is</a>
<a id='line_16173'>shame that we suffer them thus to ride over our lands, for wit you</a>
<a id='line_16174'>well, suffer ye them as long as ye will, they will do you no favour an</a>
<a id='line_16175'>they may handle you. Then said Sir Lionel that was wary and wise: My</a>
<a id='line_16176'>lord Sir Launcelot, I will give this counsel, let us keep our strong</a>
<a id='line_16177'>walled towns until they have hunger and cold, and blow on their nails;</a>
<a id='line_16178'>and then let us freshly set upon them, and shred them down as sheep in</a>
<a id='line_16179'>a field, that aliens may take example for ever how they land upon our</a>
<a id='line_16180'>lands.</a>
<a id='line_16181'></a>
<a id='line_16182'>Then spake King Bagdemagus to Sir Launcelot: Sir, your courtesy will</a>
<a id='line_16183'>shende us all, and thy courtesy hath waked all this sorrow; for an they</a>
<a id='line_16184'>thus over our lands ride, they shall by process bring us all to nought</a>
<a id='line_16185'>whilst we thus in holes us hide. Then said Sir Galihud unto Sir</a>
<a id='line_16186'>Launcelot: Sir, here be knights come of kings’ blood, that will not</a>
<a id='line_16187'>long droop, and they are within these walls; therefore give us leave,</a>
<a id='line_16188'>like as we be knights, to meet them in the field, and we shall slay</a>
<a id='line_16189'>them, that they shall curse the time that ever they came into this</a>
<a id='line_16190'>country. Then spake seven brethren of North Wales, and they were seven</a>
<a id='line_16191'>noble knights; a man might seek in seven kings’ lands or he might find</a>
<a id='line_16192'>such seven knights. Then they all said at once: Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_16193'>Christ’s sake let us out ride with Sir Galihud, for we be never wont to</a>
<a id='line_16194'>cower in castles nor in noble towns.</a>
<a id='line_16195'></a>
<a id='line_16196'>Then spake Sir Launcelot, that was master and governor of them all: My</a>
<a id='line_16197'>fair lords, wit you well I am full loath to ride out with my knights</a>
<a id='line_16198'>for shedding of Christian blood; and yet my lands I understand be full</a>
<a id='line_16199'>bare for to sustain any host awhile, for the mighty wars that whilom</a>
<a id='line_16200'>made King Claudas upon this country, upon my father King Ban, and on</a>
<a id='line_16201'>mine uncle King Bors; howbeit we will as at this time keep our strong</a>
<a id='line_16202'>walls, and I shall send a messenger unto my lord Arthur, a treaty for</a>
<a id='line_16203'>to take; for better is peace than always war.</a>
<a id='line_16204'></a>
<a id='line_16205'>So Sir Launcelot sent forth a damosel and a dwarf with her, requiring</a>
<a id='line_16206'>King Arthur to leave his warring upon his lands; and so she start upon</a>
<a id='line_16207'>a palfrey, and the dwarf ran by her side. And when she came to the</a>
<a id='line_16208'>pavilion of King Arthur, there she alighted; and there met her a gentle</a>
<a id='line_16209'>knight, Sir Lucan the Butler, and said: Fair damosel, come ye from Sir</a>
<a id='line_16210'>Launcelot du Lake? Yea sir, she said, therefore I come hither to speak</a>
<a id='line_16211'>with my lord the king. Alas, said Sir Lucan, my lord Arthur would love</a>
<a id='line_16212'>Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine will not suffer him. And then he said: I</a>
<a id='line_16213'>pray to God, damosel, ye may speed well, for all we that be about the</a>
<a id='line_16214'>king would Sir Launcelot did best of any knight living. And so with</a>
<a id='line_16215'>this Lucan led the damosel unto the king where he sat with Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_16216'>for to hear what she would say. So when she had told her tale, the</a>
<a id='line_16217'>water ran out of the king’s eyen, and all the lords were full glad for</a>
<a id='line_16218'>to advise the king as to be accorded with Sir Launcelot, save all only</a>
<a id='line_16219'>Sir Gawaine, and he said: My lord mine uncle, what will ye do? Will ye</a>
<a id='line_16220'>now turn again, now ye are passed thus far upon this journey? all the</a>
<a id='line_16221'>world will speak of your villainy. Nay, said Arthur, wit thou well, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16222'>Gawaine, I will do as ye will advise me; and yet meseemeth, said</a>
<a id='line_16223'>Arthur, his fair proffers were not good to be refused; but sithen I am</a>
<a id='line_16224'>come so far upon this journey, I will that ye give the damosel her</a>
<a id='line_16225'>answer, for I may not speak to her for pity, for her proffers be so</a>
<a id='line_16226'>large.</a>
<a id='line_16227'></a>
<a id='line_16228'></a>
<a id='line_16229'></a>
<a id='line_16230'></a>
<a id='line_16231'>CHAPTER XX. What message Sir Gawaine sent to Sir Launcelot; and how</a>
<a id='line_16232'>King Arthur laid siege to Benwick, and other matters.</a>
<a id='line_16233'></a>
<a id='line_16234'></a>
<a id='line_16235'>Then Sir Gawaine said to the damosel thus: Damosel, say ye to Sir</a>
<a id='line_16236'>Launcelot that it is waste labour now to sue to mine uncle; for tell</a>
<a id='line_16237'>him, an he would have made any labour for peace, he should have made it</a>
<a id='line_16238'>or this time, for tell him now it is too late; and say that I, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16239'>Gawaine, so send him word, that I promise him by the faith I owe unto</a>
<a id='line_16240'>God and to knighthood, I shall never leave him till he have slain me or</a>
<a id='line_16241'>I him. So the damosel wept and departed, and there were many weeping</a>
<a id='line_16242'>eyen; and so Sir Lucan brought the damosel to her palfrey, and so she</a>
<a id='line_16243'>came to Sir Launcelot where he was among all his knights. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_16244'>Launcelot had heard this answer, then the tears ran down by his cheeks.</a>
<a id='line_16245'>And then his noble knights strode about him, and said: Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16246'>wherefore make ye such cheer, think what ye are, and what men we are,</a>
<a id='line_16247'>and let us noble knights match them in midst of the field. That may be</a>
<a id='line_16248'>lightly done, said Sir Launcelot, but I was never so loath to do</a>
<a id='line_16249'>battle, and therefore I pray you, fair sirs, as ye love me, be ruled as</a>
<a id='line_16250'>I will have you, for I will always flee that noble king that made me</a>
<a id='line_16251'>knight. And when I may no further, I must needs defend me, and that</a>
<a id='line_16252'>will be more worship for me and us all than to compare with that noble</a>
<a id='line_16253'>king whom we have all served. Then they held their language, and as</a>
<a id='line_16254'>that night they took their rest.</a>
<a id='line_16255'></a>
<a id='line_16256'>And upon the morn early, in the dawning of the day, as knights looked</a>
<a id='line_16257'>out, they saw the city of Benwick besieged round about; and fast they</a>
<a id='line_16258'>began to set up ladders, and then they defied them out of the town, and</a>
<a id='line_16259'>beat them from the walls wightly. Then came forth Sir Gawaine well</a>
<a id='line_16260'>armed upon a stiff steed, and he came before the chief gate, with his</a>
<a id='line_16261'>spear in his hand, crying: Sir Launcelot, where art thou? is there none</a>
<a id='line_16262'>of you proud knights dare break a spear with me? Then Sir Bors made him</a>
<a id='line_16263'>ready, and came forth out of the town, and there Sir Gawaine</a>
<a id='line_16264'>encountered with Sir Bors. And at that time he smote Sir Bors down from</a>
<a id='line_16265'>his horse, and almost he had slain him; and so Sir Bors was rescued and</a>
<a id='line_16266'>borne into the town. Then came forth Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Bors,</a>
<a id='line_16267'>and thought to revenge him; and either feutred their spears, and ran</a>
<a id='line_16268'>together; and there they met spitefully, but Sir Gawaine had such grace</a>
<a id='line_16269'>that he smote Sir Lionel down, and wounded him there passing sore; and</a>
<a id='line_16270'>then Sir Lionel was rescued and borne into the town. And this Sir</a>
<a id='line_16271'>Gawaine came every day, and he failed not but that he smote down one</a>
<a id='line_16272'>knight or other.</a>
<a id='line_16273'></a>
<a id='line_16274'>So thus they endured half a year, and much slaughter was of people on</a>
<a id='line_16275'>both parties. Then it befell upon a day, Sir Gawaine came afore the</a>
<a id='line_16276'>gates armed at all pieces on a noble horse, with a great spear in his</a>
<a id='line_16277'>hand; and then he cried with a loud voice: Where art thou now, thou</a>
<a id='line_16278'>false traitor, Sir Launcelot? Why hidest thou thyself within holes and</a>
<a id='line_16279'>walls like a coward? Look out now, thou false traitor knight, and here</a>
<a id='line_16280'>I shall revenge upon thy body the death of my three brethren. All this</a>
<a id='line_16281'>language heard Sir Launcelot every deal; and his kin and his knights</a>
<a id='line_16282'>drew about him, and all they said at once to Sir Launcelot: Sir</a>
<a id='line_16283'>Launcelot, now must ye defend you like a knight, or else ye be shamed</a>
<a id='line_16284'>for ever; for, now ye be called upon treason, it is time for you to</a>
<a id='line_16285'>stir, for ye have slept over-long and suffered over-much. So God me</a>
<a id='line_16286'>help, said Sir Launcelot, I am right heavy of Sir Gawaine’s words, for</a>
<a id='line_16287'>now he charged me with a great charge; and therefore I wot it as well</a>
<a id='line_16288'>as ye, that I must defend me, or else to be recreant.</a>
<a id='line_16289'></a>
<a id='line_16290'>Then Sir Launcelot bade saddle his strongest horse, and bade let fetch</a>
<a id='line_16291'>his arms, and bring all unto the gate of the tower; and then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16292'>Launcelot spake on high unto King Arthur, and said: My lord Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_16293'>noble king that made me knight, wit you well I am right heavy for your</a>
<a id='line_16294'>sake, that ye thus sue upon me; and always I forbare you, for an I</a>
<a id='line_16295'>would have been vengeable, I might have met you in midst of the field,</a>
<a id='line_16296'>and there to have made your boldest knights full tame. And now I have</a>
<a id='line_16297'>forborne half a year, and suffered you and Sir Gawaine to do what ye</a>
<a id='line_16298'>would do; and now may I endure it no longer, for now must I needs</a>
<a id='line_16299'>defend myself, insomuch Sir Gawaine hath appealed me of treason; the</a>
<a id='line_16300'>which is greatly against my will that ever I should fight against any</a>
<a id='line_16301'>of your blood, but now I may not forsake it, I am driven thereto as a</a>
<a id='line_16302'>beast till a bay.</a>
<a id='line_16303'></a>
<a id='line_16304'>Then Sir Gawaine said: Sir Launcelot, an thou durst do battle, leave</a>
<a id='line_16305'>thy babbling and come off, and let us ease our hearts. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16306'>Launcelot armed him lightly, and mounted upon his horse, and either of</a>
<a id='line_16307'>the knights gat great spears in their hands, and the host without stood</a>
<a id='line_16308'>still all apart, and the noble knights came out of the city by a great</a>
<a id='line_16309'>number, insomuch that when Arthur saw the number of men and knights, he</a>
<a id='line_16310'>marvelled, and said to himself: Alas, that ever Sir Launcelot was</a>
<a id='line_16311'>against me, for now I see he hath forborne me. And so the covenant was</a>
<a id='line_16312'>made, there should no man nigh them, nor deal with them, till the one</a>
<a id='line_16313'>were dead or yelden.</a>
<a id='line_16314'></a>

<a id='line_16317'></a>
<a id='line_16318'>CHAPTER XXI. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine did battle together, and</a>
<a id='line_16319'>how Sir Gawaine was overthrown and hurt.</a>
<a id='line_16320'></a>
<a id='line_16321'></a>
<a id='line_16322'>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot departed a great way asunder, and</a>
<a id='line_16323'>then they came together with all their horses’ might as they might run,</a>
<a id='line_16324'>and either smote other in midst of their shields; but the knights were</a>
<a id='line_16325'>so strong, and their spears so big, that their horses might not endure</a>
<a id='line_16326'>their buffets, and so their horses fell to the earth; and then they</a>
<a id='line_16327'>avoided their horses, and dressed their shields afore them. Then they</a>
<a id='line_16328'>stood together and gave many sad strokes on divers places of their</a>
<a id='line_16329'>bodies, that the blood brast out on many sides and places. Then had Sir</a>
<a id='line_16330'>Gawaine such a grace and gift that an holy man had given to him, that</a>
<a id='line_16331'>every day in the year, from underne till high noon, his might increased</a>
<a id='line_16332'>those three hours as much as thrice his strength, and that caused Sir</a>
<a id='line_16333'>Gawaine to win great honour. And for his sake King Arthur made an</a>
<a id='line_16334'>ordinance, that all manner of battles for any quarrels that should be</a>
<a id='line_16335'>done afore King Arthur should begin at underne; and all was done for</a>
<a id='line_16336'>Sir Gawaine’s love, that by likelihood, if Sir Gawaine were on the one</a>
<a id='line_16337'>part, he should have the better in battle while his strength endureth</a>
<a id='line_16338'>three hours; but there were but few knights that time living that knew</a>
<a id='line_16339'>this advantage that Sir Gawaine had, but King Arthur all only.</a>
<a id='line_16340'></a>
<a id='line_16341'>Thus Sir Launcelot fought with Sir Gawaine, and when Sir Launcelot felt</a>
<a id='line_16342'>his might evermore increase, Sir Launcelot wondered and dread him sore</a>
<a id='line_16343'>to be shamed. For as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot weened, when</a>
<a id='line_16344'>he felt Sir Gawaine double his strength, that he had been a fiend and</a>
<a id='line_16345'>none earthly man; wherefore Sir Launcelot traced and traversed, and</a>
<a id='line_16346'>covered himself with his shield, and kept his might and his braide</a>
<a id='line_16347'>during three hours; and that while Sir Gawaine gave him many sad</a>
<a id='line_16348'>brunts, and many sad strokes, that all the knights that beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_16349'>Launcelot marvelled how that he might endure him; but full little</a>
<a id='line_16350'>understood they that travail that Sir Launcelot had for to endure him.</a>
<a id='line_16351'>And then when it was past noon Sir Gawaine had no more but his own</a>
<a id='line_16352'>might. When Sir Launcelot felt him so come down, then he stretched him</a>
<a id='line_16353'>up and stood near Sir Gawaine, and said thus: My lord Sir Gawaine, now</a>
<a id='line_16354'>I feel ye have done; now my lord Sir Gawaine, I must do my part, for</a>
<a id='line_16355'>many great and grievous strokes I have endured you this day with great</a>
<a id='line_16356'>pain.</a>
<a id='line_16357'></a>
<a id='line_16358'>Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes and gave Sir Gawaine such a</a>
<a id='line_16359'>buffet on the helmet that he fell down on his side, and Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16360'>withdrew him from him. Why withdrawest thou thee? said Sir Gawaine; now</a>
<a id='line_16361'>turn again, false traitor knight, and slay me, for an thou leave me</a>
<a id='line_16362'>thus, when I am whole I shall do battle with thee again. I shall endure</a>
<a id='line_16363'>you, Sir, by God’s grace, but wit thou well, Sir Gawaine, I will never</a>
<a id='line_16364'>smite a felled knight. And so Sir Launcelot went into the city; and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16365'>Gawaine was borne into King Arthur’s pavilion, and leeches were brought</a>
<a id='line_16366'>to him, and searched and salved with soft ointments. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16367'>Launcelot said: Now have good day, my lord the king, for wit you well</a>
<a id='line_16368'>ye win no worship at these walls; and if I would my knights outbring,</a>
<a id='line_16369'>there should many a man die. Therefore, my lord Arthur, remember you of</a>
<a id='line_16370'>old kindness; and however I fare, Jesu be your guide in all places.</a>
<a id='line_16371'></a>
<a id='line_16372'></a>
<a id='line_16373'></a>
<a id='line_16374'></a>
<a id='line_16375'>CHAPTER XXII. Of the sorrow that King Arthur made for the war, and of</a>
<a id='line_16376'>another battle where also Sir Gawaine had the worse.</a>
<a id='line_16377'></a>
<a id='line_16378'></a>
<a id='line_16379'>Alas, said the king, that ever this unhappy war was begun; for ever Sir</a>
<a id='line_16380'>Launcelot forbeareth me in all places, and in likewise my kin, and that</a>
<a id='line_16381'>is seen well this day by my nephew Sir Gawaine. Then King Arthur fell</a>
<a id='line_16382'>sick for sorrow of Sir Gawaine, that he was so sore hurt, and because</a>
<a id='line_16383'>of the war betwixt him and Sir Launcelot. So then they on King Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_16384'>part kept the siege with little war withoutforth; and they withinforth</a>
<a id='line_16385'>kept their walls, and defended them when need was. Thus Sir Gawaine lay</a>
<a id='line_16386'>sick three weeks in his tents, with all manner of leech-craft that</a>
<a id='line_16387'>might be had. And as soon as Sir Gawaine might go and ride, he armed</a>
<a id='line_16388'>him at all points, and start upon a courser, and gat a spear in his</a>
<a id='line_16389'>hand, and so he came riding afore the chief gate of Benwick; and there</a>
<a id='line_16390'>he cried on height: Where art thou, Sir Launcelot? Come forth, thou</a>
<a id='line_16391'>false traitor knight and recreant, for I am here, Sir Gawaine, will</a>
<a id='line_16392'>prove this that I say on thee.</a>
<a id='line_16393'></a>
<a id='line_16394'>All this language Sir Launcelot heard, and then he said thus: Sir</a>
<a id='line_16395'>Gawaine, me repents of your foul saying, that ye will not cease of your</a>
<a id='line_16396'>language; for you wot well, Sir Gawaine, I know your might and all that</a>
<a id='line_16397'>ye may do; and well ye wot, Sir Gawaine, ye may not greatly hurt me.</a>
<a id='line_16398'>Come down, traitor knight, said he, and make it good the contrary with</a>
<a id='line_16399'>thy hands, for it mishapped me the last battle to be hurt of thy hands;</a>
<a id='line_16400'>therefore wit thou well I am come this day to make amends, for I ween</a>
<a id='line_16401'>this day to lay thee as low as thou laidest me. Jesu defend me, said</a>
<a id='line_16402'>Sir Launcelot, that ever I be so far in your danger as ye have been in</a>
<a id='line_16403'>mine, for then my days were done. But Sir Gawaine, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16404'>ye shall not think that I tarry long, but sithen that ye so unknightly</a>
<a id='line_16405'>call me of treason, ye shall have both your hands full of me. And then</a>
<a id='line_16406'>Sir Launcelot armed him at all points, and mounted upon his horse, and</a>
<a id='line_16407'>gat a great spear in his hand, and rode out at the gate. And both the</a>
<a id='line_16408'>hosts were assembled, of them without and of them within, and stood in</a>
<a id='line_16409'>array full manly. And both parties were charged to hold them still, to</a>
<a id='line_16410'>see and behold the battle of these two noble knights. And then they</a>
<a id='line_16411'>laid their spears in their rests, and they came together as thunder,</a>
<a id='line_16412'>and Sir Gawaine brake his spear upon Sir Launcelot in a hundred pieces</a>
<a id='line_16413'>unto his hand; and Sir Launcelot smote him with a greater might, that</a>
<a id='line_16414'>Sir Gawaine’s horse’s feet raised, and so the horse and he fell to the</a>
<a id='line_16415'>earth. Then Sir Gawaine deliverly avoided his horse, and put his shield</a>
<a id='line_16416'>afore him, and eagerly drew his sword, and bade Sir Launcelot: Alight,</a>
<a id='line_16417'>traitor knight, for if this mare’s son hath failed me, wit thou well a</a>
<a id='line_16418'>king’s son and a queen’s son shall not fail thee.</a>
<a id='line_16419'></a>
<a id='line_16420'>Then Sir Launcelot avoided his horse, and dressed his shield afore him,</a>
<a id='line_16421'>and drew his sword; and so stood they together and gave many sad</a>
<a id='line_16422'>strokes, that all men on both parties had thereof passing great wonder.</a>
<a id='line_16423'>But when Sir Launcelot felt Sir Gawaine’s might so marvellously</a>
<a id='line_16424'>increase, he then withheld his courage and his wind, and kept himself</a>
<a id='line_16425'>wonder covert of his might; and under his shield he traced and</a>
<a id='line_16426'>traversed here and there, to break Sir Gawaine’s strokes and his</a>
<a id='line_16427'>courage; and Sir Gawaine enforced himself with all his might and power</a>
<a id='line_16428'>to destroy Sir Launcelot; for as the French book saith, ever as Sir</a>
<a id='line_16429'>Gawaine’s might increased, right so increased his wind and his evil</a>
<a id='line_16430'>will. Thus Sir Gawaine did great pain unto Sir Launcelot three hours,</a>
<a id='line_16431'>that he had right great pain for to defend him.</a>
<a id='line_16432'></a>
<a id='line_16433'>And when the three hours were passed, that Sir Launcelot felt that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16434'>Gawaine was come to his own proper strength, then Sir Launcelot said</a>
<a id='line_16435'>unto Sir Gawaine: Now have I proved you twice, that ye are a full</a>
<a id='line_16436'>dangerous knight, and a wonderful man of your might; and many wonderful</a>
<a id='line_16437'>deeds have ye done in your days, for by your might increasing you have</a>
<a id='line_16438'>deceived many a full noble and valiant knight; and, now I feel that ye</a>
<a id='line_16439'>have done your mighty deeds, now wit you well I must do my deeds. And</a>
<a id='line_16440'>then Sir Launcelot stood near Sir Gawaine, and then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16441'>doubled his strokes; and Sir Gawaine defended him mightily, but</a>
<a id='line_16442'>nevertheless Sir Launcelot smote such a stroke upon Sir Gawaine’s helm,</a>
<a id='line_16443'>and upon the old wound, that Sir Gawaine sinked down upon his one side</a>
<a id='line_16444'>in a swoon. And anon as he did awake he waved and foined at Sir</a>
<a id='line_16445'>Launcelot as he lay, and said: Traitor knight, wit thou well I am not</a>
<a id='line_16446'>yet slain, come thou near me and perform this battle unto the</a>
<a id='line_16447'>uttermost. I will no more do than I have done, said Sir Launcelot, for</a>
<a id='line_16448'>when I see you on foot I will do battle upon you all the while I see</a>
<a id='line_16449'>you stand on your feet; but for to smite a wounded man that may not</a>
<a id='line_16450'>stand, God defend me from such a shame. And then he turned him and went</a>
<a id='line_16451'>his way toward the city. And Sir Gawaine evermore calling him traitor</a>
<a id='line_16452'>knight, and said: Wit thou well Sir Launcelot, when I am whole I shall</a>
<a id='line_16453'>do battle with thee again, for I shall never leave thee till that one</a>
<a id='line_16454'>of us be slain. Thus as this siege endured, and as Sir Gawaine lay sick</a>
<a id='line_16455'>near a month; and when he was well recovered and ready within three</a>
<a id='line_16456'>days to do battle again with Sir Launcelot, right so came tidings unto</a>
<a id='line_16457'>Arthur from England that made King Arthur and all his host to remove.</a>

<a id='line_16468'></a>
<a id='line_16469'>CHAPTER I. How Sir Mordred presumed and took on him to be King of</a>
<a id='line_16470'>England, and would have married the queen, his father’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_16471'></a>
<a id='line_16472'></a>
<a id='line_16473'>As Sir Mordred was ruler of all England, he did do make letters as</a>
<a id='line_16474'>though that they came from beyond the sea, and the letters specified</a>
<a id='line_16475'>that King Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Launcelot. Wherefore Sir</a>
<a id='line_16476'>Mordred made a parliament, and called the lords together, and there he</a>
<a id='line_16477'>made them to choose him king; and so was he crowned at Canterbury, and</a>
<a id='line_16478'>held a feast there fifteen days; and afterward he drew him unto</a>
<a id='line_16479'>Winchester, and there he took the Queen Guenever, and said plainly that</a>
<a id='line_16480'>he would wed her which was his uncle’s wife and his father’s wife. And</a>
<a id='line_16481'>so he made ready for the feast, and a day prefixed that they should be</a>
<a id='line_16482'>wedded; wherefore Queen Guenever was passing heavy. But she durst not</a>
<a id='line_16483'>discover her heart, but spake fair, and agreed to Sir Mordred’s will.</a>
<a id='line_16484'>Then she desired of Sir Mordred for to go to London, to buy all manner</a>
<a id='line_16485'>of things that longed unto the wedding. And because of her fair speech</a>
<a id='line_16486'>Sir Mordred trusted her well enough, and gave her leave to go. And so</a>
<a id='line_16487'>when she came to London she took the Tower of London, and suddenly in</a>
<a id='line_16488'>all haste possible she stuffed it with all manner of victual, and well</a>
<a id='line_16489'>garnished it with men, and so kept it.</a>
<a id='line_16490'></a>
<a id='line_16491'>Then when Sir Mordred wist and understood how he was beguiled, he was</a>
<a id='line_16492'>passing wroth out of measure. And a short tale for to make, he went and</a>
<a id='line_16493'>laid a mighty siege about the Tower of London, and made many great</a>
<a id='line_16494'>assaults thereat, and threw many great engines unto them, and shot</a>
<a id='line_16495'>great guns. But all might not prevail Sir Mordred, for Queen Guenever</a>
<a id='line_16496'>would never for fair speech nor for foul, would never trust to come in</a>
<a id='line_16497'>his hands again.</a>
<a id='line_16498'></a>
<a id='line_16499'>Then came the Bishop of Canterbury, the which was a noble clerk and an</a>
<a id='line_16500'>holy man, and thus he said to Sir Mordred: Sir, what will ye do? will</a>
<a id='line_16501'>ye first displease God and sithen shame yourself, and all knighthood?</a>
<a id='line_16502'>Is not King Arthur your uncle, no farther but your mother’s brother,</a>
<a id='line_16503'>and on her himself King Arthur begat you upon his own sister, therefore</a>
<a id='line_16504'>how may you wed your father’s wife? Sir, said the noble clerk, leave</a>
<a id='line_16505'>this opinion or I shall curse you with book and bell and candle. Do</a>
<a id='line_16506'>thou thy worst, said Sir Mordred, wit thou well I shall defy thee. Sir,</a>
<a id='line_16507'>said the Bishop, and wit you well I shall not fear me to do that me</a>
<a id='line_16508'>ought to do. Also where ye noise where my lord Arthur is slain, and</a>
<a id='line_16509'>that is not so, and therefore ye will make a foul work in this land.</a>
<a id='line_16510'>Peace, thou false priest, said Sir Mordred, for an thou chafe me any</a>
<a id='line_16511'>more I shall make strike off thy head. So the Bishop departed and did</a>
<a id='line_16512'>the cursing in the most orgulist wise that might be done. And then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16513'>Mordred sought the Bishop of Canterbury, for to have slain him. Then</a>
<a id='line_16514'>the Bishop fled, and took part of his goods with him, and went nigh</a>
<a id='line_16515'>unto Glastonbury; and there he was as priest hermit in a chapel, and</a>
<a id='line_16516'>lived in poverty and in holy prayers, for well he understood that</a>
<a id='line_16517'>mischievous war was at hand.</a>
<a id='line_16518'></a>
<a id='line_16519'>Then Sir Mordred sought on Queen Guenever by letters and sonds, and by</a>
<a id='line_16520'>fair means and foul means, for to have her to come out of the Tower of</a>
<a id='line_16521'>London; but all this availed not, for she answered him shortly, openly</a>
<a id='line_16522'>and privily, that she had liefer slay herself than to be married with</a>
<a id='line_16523'>him. Then came word to Sir Mordred that King Arthur had araised the</a>
<a id='line_16524'>siege for Sir Launcelot, and he was coming homeward with a great host,</a>
<a id='line_16525'>to be avenged upon Sir Mordred; wherefore Sir Mordred made write writs</a>
<a id='line_16526'>to all the barony of this land, and much people drew to him. For then</a>
<a id='line_16527'>was the common voice among them that with Arthur was none other life</a>
<a id='line_16528'>but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss. Thus</a>
<a id='line_16529'>was Sir Arthur depraved, and evil said of. And many there were that</a>
<a id='line_16530'>King Arthur had made up of nought, and given them lands, might not then</a>
<a id='line_16531'>say him a good word. Lo ye all Englishmen, see ye not what a mischief</a>
<a id='line_16532'>here was! for he that was the most king and knight of the world, and</a>
<a id='line_16533'>most loved the fellowship of noble knights, and by him they were all</a>
<a id='line_16534'>upholden, now might not these Englishmen hold them content with him. Lo</a>
<a id='line_16535'>thus was the old custom and usage of this land; and also men say that</a>
<a id='line_16536'>we of this land have not yet lost nor forgotten that custom and usage.</a>
<a id='line_16537'>Alas, this is a great default of us Englishmen, for there may no thing</a>
<a id='line_16538'>please us no term. And so fared the people at that time, they were</a>
<a id='line_16539'>better pleased with Sir Mordred than they were with King Arthur; and</a>
<a id='line_16540'>much people drew unto Sir Mordred, and said they would abide with him</a>
<a id='line_16541'>for better and for worse. And so Sir Mordred drew with a great host to</a>
<a id='line_16542'>Dover, for there he heard say that Sir Arthur would arrive, and so he</a>
<a id='line_16543'>thought to beat his own father from his lands; and the most part of all</a>
<a id='line_16544'>England held with Sir Mordred, the people were so new-fangle.</a>
<a id='line_16545'></a>
<a id='line_16546'></a>
<a id='line_16547'></a>
<a id='line_16548'></a>
<a id='line_16549'>CHAPTER II. How after that King Arthur had tidings, he returned and</a>
<a id='line_16550'>came to Dover, where Sir Mordred met him to let his landing; and of the</a>
<a id='line_16551'>death of Sir Gawaine.</a>
<a id='line_16552'></a>
<a id='line_16553'></a>
<a id='line_16554'>And so as Sir Mordred was at Dover with his host, there came King</a>
<a id='line_16555'>Arthur with a great navy of ships, and galleys, and carracks. And there</a>
<a id='line_16556'>was Sir Mordred ready awaiting upon his landing, to let his own father</a>
<a id='line_16557'>to land upon the land that he was king over. Then there was launching</a>
<a id='line_16558'>of great boats and small, and full of noble men of arms; and there was</a>
<a id='line_16559'>much slaughter of gentle knights, and many a full bold baron was laid</a>
<a id='line_16560'>full low, on both parties. But King Arthur was so courageous that there</a>
<a id='line_16561'>might no manner of knights let him to land, and his knights fiercely</a>
<a id='line_16562'>followed him; and so they landed maugre Sir Mordred and all his power,</a>
<a id='line_16563'>and put Sir Mordred aback, that he fled and all his people.</a>
<a id='line_16564'></a>
<a id='line_16565'>So when this battle was done, King Arthur let bury his people that were</a>
<a id='line_16566'>dead. And then was noble Sir Gawaine found in a great boat, lying more</a>
<a id='line_16567'>than half dead. When Sir Arthur wist that Sir Gawaine was laid so low;</a>
<a id='line_16568'>he went unto him; and there the king made sorrow out of measure, and</a>
<a id='line_16569'>took Sir Gawaine in his arms, and thrice he there swooned. And then</a>
<a id='line_16570'>when he awaked, he said: Alas, Sir Gawaine, my sister’s son, here now</a>
<a id='line_16571'>thou liest; the man in the world that I loved most; and now is my joy</a>
<a id='line_16572'>gone, for now, my nephew Sir Gawaine, I will discover me unto your</a>
<a id='line_16573'>person: in Sir Launcelot and you I most had my joy, and mine affiance,</a>
<a id='line_16574'>and now have I lost my joy of you both; wherefore all mine earthly joy</a>
<a id='line_16575'>is gone from me. Mine uncle King Arthur, said Sir Gawaine, wit you well</a>
<a id='line_16576'>my death-day is come, and all is through mine own hastiness and</a>
<a id='line_16577'>wilfulness; for I am smitten upon the old wound the which Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16578'>gave me, on the which I feel well I must die; and had Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_16579'>been with you as he was, this unhappy war had never begun; and of all</a>
<a id='line_16580'>this am I causer, for Sir Launcelot and his blood, through their</a>
<a id='line_16581'>prowess, held all your cankered enemies in subjection and daunger. And</a>
<a id='line_16582'>now, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall miss Sir Launcelot. But alas, I would</a>
<a id='line_16583'>not accord with him, and therefore, said Sir Gawaine, I pray you, fair</a>
<a id='line_16584'>uncle, that I may have paper, pen, and ink, that I may write to Sir</a>
<a id='line_16585'>Launcelot a cedle with mine own hands.</a>
<a id='line_16586'></a>
<a id='line_16587'>And then when paper and ink was brought, then Gawaine was set up weakly</a>
<a id='line_16588'>by King Arthur, for he was shriven a little to-fore; and then he wrote</a>
<a id='line_16589'>thus, as the French book maketh mention: Unto Sir Launcelot, flower of</a>
<a id='line_16590'>all noble knights that ever I heard of or saw by my days, I, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16591'>Gawaine, King Lot’s son of Orkney, sister’s son unto the noble King</a>
<a id='line_16592'>Arthur, send thee greeting, and let thee have knowledge that the tenth</a>
<a id='line_16593'>day of May I was smitten upon the old wound that thou gavest me afore</a>
<a id='line_16594'>the city of Benwick, and through the same wound that thou gavest me I</a>
<a id='line_16595'>am come to my death-day. And I will that all the world wit, that I, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16596'>Gawaine, knight of the Table Round, sought my death, and not through</a>
<a id='line_16597'>thy deserving, but it was mine own seeking; wherefore I beseech thee,</a>
<a id='line_16598'>Sir Launcelot, to return again unto this realm, and see my tomb, and</a>
<a id='line_16599'>pray some prayer more or less for my soul. And this same day that I</a>
<a id='line_16600'>wrote this cedle, I was hurt to the death in the same wound, the which</a>
<a id='line_16601'>I had of thy hand, Sir Launcelot; for of a more nobler man might I not</a>
<a id='line_16602'>be slain. Also Sir Launcelot, for all the love that ever was betwixt</a>
<a id='line_16603'>us, make no tarrying, but come over the sea in all haste, that thou</a>
<a id='line_16604'>mayst with thy noble knights rescue that noble king that made thee</a>
<a id='line_16605'>knight, that is my lord Arthur; for he is full straitly bestead with a</a>
<a id='line_16606'>false traitor, that is my half-brother, Sir Mordred; and he hath let</a>
<a id='line_16607'>crown him king, and would have wedded my lady Queen Guenever, and so</a>
<a id='line_16608'>had he done had she not put herself in the Tower of London. And so the</a>
<a id='line_16609'>tenth day of May last past, my lord Arthur and we all landed upon them</a>
<a id='line_16610'>at Dover; and there we put that false traitor, Sir Mordred, to flight,</a>
<a id='line_16611'>and there it misfortuned me to be stricken upon thy stroke. And at the</a>
<a id='line_16612'>date of this letter was written, but two hours and a half afore my</a>
<a id='line_16613'>death, written with mine own hand, and so subscribed with part of my</a>
<a id='line_16614'>heart’s blood. And I require thee, most famous knight of the world,</a>
<a id='line_16615'>that thou wilt see my tomb. And then Sir Gawaine wept, and King Arthur</a>
<a id='line_16616'>wept; and then they swooned both. And when they awaked both, the king</a>
<a id='line_16617'>made Sir Gawaine to receive his Saviour. And then Sir Gawaine prayed</a>
<a id='line_16618'>the king for to send for Sir Launcelot, and to cherish him above all</a>
<a id='line_16619'>other knights.</a>
<a id='line_16620'></a>
<a id='line_16621'>And so at the hour of noon Sir Gawaine yielded up the spirit; and then</a>
<a id='line_16622'>the king let inter him in a chapel within Dover Castle; and there yet</a>
<a id='line_16623'>all men may see the skull of him, and the same wound is seen that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16624'>Launcelot gave him in battle. Then was it told the king that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16625'>Mordred had pight a new field upon Barham Down. And upon the morn the</a>
<a id='line_16626'>king rode thither to him, and there was a great battle betwixt them,</a>
<a id='line_16627'>and much people was slain on both parties; but at the last Sir Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_16628'>party stood best, and Sir Mordred and his party fled unto Canterbury.</a>
<a id='line_16629'></a>
<a id='line_16630'></a>
<a id='line_16631'></a>
<a id='line_16632'></a>
<a id='line_16633'>CHAPTER III. How after, Sir Gawaine’s ghost appeared to King Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_16634'>and warned him that he should not fight that day.</a>
<a id='line_16635'></a>
<a id='line_16636'></a>
<a id='line_16637'>And then the king let search all the towns for his knights that were</a>
<a id='line_16638'>slain, and interred them; and salved them with soft salves that so sore</a>
<a id='line_16639'>were wounded. Then much people drew unto King Arthur. And then they</a>
<a id='line_16640'>said that Sir Mordred warred upon King Arthur with wrong. And then King</a>
<a id='line_16641'>Arthur drew him with his host down by the seaside, westward toward</a>
<a id='line_16642'>Salisbury; and there was a day assigned betwixt King Arthur and Sir</a>
<a id='line_16643'>Mordred, that they should meet upon a down beside Salisbury, and not</a>
<a id='line_16644'>far from the seaside; and this day was assigned on a Monday after</a>
<a id='line_16645'>Trinity Sunday, whereof King Arthur was passing glad, that he might be</a>
<a id='line_16646'>avenged upon Sir Mordred. Then Sir Mordred araised much people about</a>
<a id='line_16647'>London, for they of Kent, Southsex, and Surrey, Estsex, and of</a>
<a id='line_16648'>Southfolk, and of Northfolk, held the most part with Sir Mordred; and</a>
<a id='line_16649'>many a full noble knight drew unto Sir Mordred and to the king: but</a>
<a id='line_16650'>they that loved Sir Launcelot drew unto Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_16651'></a>
<a id='line_16652'>So upon Trinity Sunday at night, King Arthur dreamed a wonderful dream,</a>
<a id='line_16653'>and that was this: that him seemed he sat upon a chaflet in a chair,</a>
<a id='line_16654'>and the chair was fast to a wheel, and thereupon sat King Arthur in the</a>
<a id='line_16655'>richest cloth of gold that might be made; and the king thought there</a>
<a id='line_16656'>was under him, far from him, an hideous deep black water, and therein</a>
<a id='line_16657'>were all manner of serpents, and worms, and wild beasts, foul and</a>
<a id='line_16658'>horrible; and suddenly the king thought the wheel turned up-so-down,</a>
<a id='line_16659'>and he fell among the serpents, and every beast took him by a limb; and</a>
<a id='line_16660'>then the king cried as he lay in his bed and slept: Help. And then</a>
<a id='line_16661'>knights, squires, and yeomen, awaked the king; and then he was so</a>
<a id='line_16662'>amazed that he wist not where he was; and then he fell a-slumbering</a>
<a id='line_16663'>again, not sleeping nor thoroughly waking. So the king seemed verily</a>
<a id='line_16664'>that there came Sir Gawaine unto him with a number of fair ladies with</a>
<a id='line_16665'>him. And when King Arthur saw him, then he said: Welcome, my sister’s</a>
<a id='line_16666'>son; I weened thou hadst been dead, and now I see thee alive, much am I</a>
<a id='line_16667'>beholding unto Almighty Jesu. O fair nephew and my sister’s son, what</a>
<a id='line_16668'>be these ladies that hither be come with you? Sir, said Sir Gawaine,</a>
<a id='line_16669'>all these be ladies for whom I have foughten when I was man living, and</a>
<a id='line_16670'>all these are those that I did battle for in righteous quarrel; and God</a>
<a id='line_16671'>hath given them that grace at their great prayer, because I did battle</a>
<a id='line_16672'>for them, that they should bring me hither unto you: thus much hath God</a>
<a id='line_16673'>given me leave, for to warn you of your death; for an ye fight as</a>
<a id='line_16674'>to-morn with Sir Mordred, as ye both have assigned, doubt ye not ye</a>
<a id='line_16675'>must be slain, and the most part of your people on both parties. And</a>
<a id='line_16676'>for the great grace and goodness that almighty Jesu hath unto you, and</a>
<a id='line_16677'>for pity of you, and many more other good men there shall be slain, God</a>
<a id='line_16678'>hath sent me to you of his special grace, to give you warning that in</a>
<a id='line_16679'>no wise ye do battle as to-morn, but that ye take a treaty for a month</a>
<a id='line_16680'>day; and proffer you largely, so as to-morn to be put in a delay. For</a>
<a id='line_16681'>within a month shall come Sir Launcelot with all his noble knights, and</a>
<a id='line_16682'>rescue you worshipfully, and slay Sir Mordred, and all that ever will</a>
<a id='line_16683'>hold with him. Then Sir Gawaine and all the ladies vanished.</a>
<a id='line_16684'></a>
<a id='line_16685'>And anon the king called upon his knights, squires, and yeomen, and</a>
<a id='line_16686'>charged them wightly to fetch his noble lords and wise bishops unto</a>
<a id='line_16687'>him. And when they were come, the king told them his avision, what Sir</a>
<a id='line_16688'>Gawaine had told him, and warned him that if he fought on the morn he</a>
<a id='line_16689'>should be slain. Then the king commanded Sir Lucan the Butler, and his</a>
<a id='line_16690'>brother Sir Bedivere, with two bishops with them, and charged them in</a>
<a id='line_16691'>any wise, an they might, Take a treaty for a month day with Sir</a>
<a id='line_16692'>Mordred, and spare not, proffer him lands and goods as much as ye think</a>
<a id='line_16693'>best. So then they departed, and came to Sir Mordred, where he had a</a>
<a id='line_16694'>grim host of an hundred thousand men. And there they entreated Sir</a>
<a id='line_16695'>Mordred long time; and at the last Sir Mordred was agreed for to have</a>
<a id='line_16696'>Cornwall and Kent, by Arthur’s days: after, all England, after the days</a>
<a id='line_16697'>of King Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_16698'></a>
<a id='line_16699'></a>
<a id='line_16700'></a>
<a id='line_16701'></a>
<a id='line_16702'>CHAPTER IV. How by misadventure of an adder the battle began, where</a>
<a id='line_16703'>Mordred was slain, and Arthur hurt to the death.</a>
<a id='line_16704'></a>
<a id='line_16705'></a>
<a id='line_16706'>Then were they condescended that King Arthur and Sir Mordred should</a>
<a id='line_16707'>meet betwixt both their hosts, and everych of them should bring</a>
<a id='line_16708'>fourteen persons; and they came with this word unto Arthur. Then said</a>
<a id='line_16709'>he: I am glad that this is done: and so he went into the field. And</a>
<a id='line_16710'>when Arthur should depart, he warned all his host that an they see any</a>
<a id='line_16711'>sword drawn: Look ye come on fiercely, and slay that traitor, Sir</a>
<a id='line_16712'>Mordred, for I in no wise trust him. In like wise Sir Mordred warned</a>
<a id='line_16713'>his host that: An ye see any sword drawn, look that ye come on</a>
<a id='line_16714'>fiercely, and so slay all that ever before you standeth; for in no wise</a>
<a id='line_16715'>I will not trust for this treaty, for I know well my father will be</a>
<a id='line_16716'>avenged on me. And so they met as their appointment was, and so they</a>
<a id='line_16717'>were agreed and accorded thoroughly; and wine was fetched, and they</a>
<a id='line_16718'>drank. Right soon came an adder out of a little heath bush, and it</a>
<a id='line_16719'>stung a knight on the foot. And when the knight felt him stung, he</a>
<a id='line_16720'>looked down and saw the adder, and then he drew his sword to slay the</a>
<a id='line_16721'>adder, and thought of none other harm. And when the host on both</a>
<a id='line_16722'>parties saw that sword drawn, then they blew beams, trumpets, and</a>
<a id='line_16723'>horns, and shouted grimly. And so both hosts dressed them together. And</a>
<a id='line_16724'>King Arthur took his horse, and said: Alas this unhappy day! and so</a>
<a id='line_16725'>rode to his party. And Sir Mordred in like wise. And never was there</a>
<a id='line_16726'>seen a more dolefuller battle in no Christian land; for there was but</a>
<a id='line_16727'>rushing and riding, foining and striking, and many a grim word was</a>
<a id='line_16728'>there spoken either to other, and many a deadly stroke. But ever King</a>
<a id='line_16729'>Arthur rode throughout the battle of Sir Mordred many times, and did</a>
<a id='line_16730'>full nobly as a noble king should, and at all times he fainted never;</a>
<a id='line_16731'>and Sir Mordred that day put him in devoir, and in great peril. And</a>
<a id='line_16732'>thus they fought all the long day, and never stinted till the noble</a>
<a id='line_16733'>knights were laid to the cold earth; and ever they fought still till it</a>
<a id='line_16734'>was near night, and by that time was there an hundred thousand laid</a>
<a id='line_16735'>dead upon the down. Then was Arthur wood wroth out of measure, when he</a>
<a id='line_16736'>saw his people so slain from him.</a>
<a id='line_16737'></a>
<a id='line_16738'>Then the king looked about him, and then was he ware, of all his host</a>
<a id='line_16739'>and of all his good knights, were left no more alive but two knights;</a>
<a id='line_16740'>that one was Sir Lucan the Butler, and his brother Sir Bedivere, and</a>
<a id='line_16741'>they were full sore wounded. Jesu mercy, said the king, where are all</a>
<a id='line_16742'>my noble knights become? Alas that ever I should see this doleful day,</a>
<a id='line_16743'>for now, said Arthur, I am come to mine end. But would to God that I</a>
<a id='line_16744'>wist where were that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all this</a>
<a id='line_16745'>mischief. Then was King Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his</a>
<a id='line_16746'>sword among a great heap of dead men. Now give me my spear, said Arthur</a>
<a id='line_16747'>unto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the traitor that all this woe</a>
<a id='line_16748'>hath wrought. Sir, let him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and</a>
<a id='line_16749'>if ye pass this unhappy day ye shall be right well revenged upon him.</a>
<a id='line_16750'>Good lord, remember ye of your night’s dream, and what the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_16751'>Sir Gawaine told you this night, yet God of his great goodness hath</a>
<a id='line_16752'>preserved you hitherto. Therefore, for God’s sake, my lord, leave off</a>
<a id='line_16753'>by this, for blessed be God ye have won the field, for here we be three</a>
<a id='line_16754'>alive, and with Sir Mordred is none alive; and if ye leave off now this</a>
<a id='line_16755'>wicked day of destiny is past. Tide me death, betide me life, saith the</a>
<a id='line_16756'>king, now I see him yonder alone he shall never escape mine hands, for</a>
<a id='line_16757'>at a better avail shall I never have him. God speed you well, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16758'>Bedivere.</a>
<a id='line_16759'></a>
<a id='line_16760'>Then the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran toward Sir</a>
<a id='line_16761'>Mordred, crying: Traitor, now is thy death-day come. And when Sir</a>
<a id='line_16762'>Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until him with his sword drawn in his</a>
<a id='line_16763'>hand. And there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield, with a</a>
<a id='line_16764'>foin of his spear, throughout the body, more than a fathom. And when</a>
<a id='line_16765'>Sir Mordred felt that he had his death wound he thrust himself with the</a>
<a id='line_16766'>might that he had up to the bur of King Arthur’s spear. And right so he</a>
<a id='line_16767'>smote his father Arthur, with his sword holden in both his hands, on</a>
<a id='line_16768'>the side of the head, that the sword pierced the helmet and the</a>
<a id='line_16769'>brain-pan, and therewithal Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth;</a>
<a id='line_16770'>and the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned</a>
<a id='line_16771'>ofttimes. And Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedivere ofttimes heaved him</a>
<a id='line_16772'>up. And so weakly they led him betwixt them both, to a little chapel</a>
<a id='line_16773'>not far from the seaside. And when the king was there he thought him</a>
<a id='line_16774'>well eased.</a>
<a id='line_16775'></a>
<a id='line_16776'>Then heard they people cry in the field. Now go thou, Sir Lucan, said</a>
<a id='line_16777'>the king, and do me to wit what betokens that noise in the field. So</a>
<a id='line_16778'>Sir Lucan departed, for he was grievously wounded in many places. And</a>
<a id='line_16779'>so as he yede, he saw and hearkened by the moonlight, how that pillers</a>
<a id='line_16780'>and robbers were come into the field, to pill and to rob many a full</a>
<a id='line_16781'>noble knight of brooches, and beads, of many a good ring, and of many a</a>
<a id='line_16782'>rich jewel; and who that were not dead all out, there they slew them</a>
<a id='line_16783'>for their harness and their riches. When Sir Lucan understood this</a>
<a id='line_16784'>work, he came to the king as soon as he might, and told him all what he</a>
<a id='line_16785'>had heard and seen. Therefore by my rede, said Sir Lucan, it is best</a>
<a id='line_16786'>that we bring you to some town. I would it were so, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_16787'></a>
<a id='line_16788'></a>
<a id='line_16789'></a>
<a id='line_16790'></a>
<a id='line_16791'>CHAPTER V. How King Arthur commanded to cast his sword Excalibur into</a>
<a id='line_16792'>the water, and how he was delivered to ladies in a barge.</a>
<a id='line_16793'></a>
<a id='line_16794'></a>
<a id='line_16795'>But I may not stand, mine head works so. Ah Sir Launcelot, said King</a>
<a id='line_16796'>Arthur, this day have I sore missed thee: alas, that ever I was against</a>
<a id='line_16797'>thee, for now have I my death, whereof Sir Gawaine me warned in my</a>
<a id='line_16798'>dream. Then Sir Lucan took up the king the one part, and Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_16799'>the other part, and in the lifting the king swooned; and Sir Lucan fell</a>
<a id='line_16800'>in a swoon with the lift, that the part of his guts fell out of his</a>
<a id='line_16801'>body, and therewith the noble knight’s heart brast. And when the king</a>
<a id='line_16802'>awoke, he beheld Sir Lucan, how he lay foaming at the mouth, and part</a>
<a id='line_16803'>of his guts lay at his feet. Alas, said the king, this is to me a full</a>
<a id='line_16804'>heavy sight, to see this noble duke so die for my sake, for he would</a>
<a id='line_16805'>have holpen me, that had more need of help than I. Alas, he would not</a>
<a id='line_16806'>complain him, his heart was so set to help me: now Jesu have mercy upon</a>
<a id='line_16807'>his soul! Then Sir Bedivere wept for the death of his brother. Leave</a>
<a id='line_16808'>this mourning and weeping, said the king, for all this will not avail</a>
<a id='line_16809'>me, for wit thou well an I might live myself, the death of Sir Lucan</a>
<a id='line_16810'>would grieve me evermore; but my time hieth fast, said the king.</a>
<a id='line_16811'>Therefore, said Arthur unto Sir Bedivere, take thou Excalibur, my good</a>
<a id='line_16812'>sword, and go with it to yonder water side, and when thou comest there</a>
<a id='line_16813'>I charge thee throw my sword in that water, and come again and tell me</a>
<a id='line_16814'>what thou there seest. My lord, said Bedivere, your commandment shall</a>
<a id='line_16815'>be done, and lightly bring you word again.</a>
<a id='line_16816'></a>
<a id='line_16817'>So Sir Bedivere departed, and by the way he beheld that noble sword,</a>
<a id='line_16818'>that the pommel and the haft was all of precious stones; and then he</a>
<a id='line_16819'>said to himself: If I throw this rich sword in the water, thereof shall</a>
<a id='line_16820'>never come good, but harm and loss. And then Sir Bedivere hid Excalibur</a>
<a id='line_16821'>under a tree. And so, as soon as he might, he came again unto the king,</a>
<a id='line_16822'>and said he had been at the water, and had thrown the sword in the</a>
<a id='line_16823'>water. What saw thou there? said the king. Sir, he said, I saw nothing</a>
<a id='line_16824'>but waves and winds. That is untruly said of thee, said the king,</a>
<a id='line_16825'>therefore go thou lightly again, and do my commandment; as thou art to</a>
<a id='line_16826'>me lief and dear, spare not, but throw it in. Then Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_16827'>returned again, and took the sword in his hand; and then him thought</a>
<a id='line_16828'>sin and shame to throw away that noble sword, and so eft he hid the</a>
<a id='line_16829'>sword, and returned again, and told to the king that he had been at the</a>
<a id='line_16830'>water, and done his commandment. What saw thou there? said the king.</a>
<a id='line_16831'>Sir, he said, I saw nothing but the waters wap and waves wan. Ah,</a>
<a id='line_16832'>traitor untrue, said King Arthur, now hast thou betrayed me twice. Who</a>
<a id='line_16833'>would have weened that, thou that hast been to me so lief and dear? and</a>
<a id='line_16834'>thou art named a noble knight, and would betray me for the richness of</a>
<a id='line_16835'>the sword. But now go again lightly, for thy long tarrying putteth me</a>
<a id='line_16836'>in great jeopardy of my life, for I have taken cold. And but if thou do</a>
<a id='line_16837'>now as I bid thee, if ever I may see thee, I shall slay thee with mine</a>
<a id='line_16838'>own hands; for thou wouldst for my rich sword see me dead.</a>
<a id='line_16839'></a>
<a id='line_16840'>Then Sir Bedivere departed, and went to the sword, and lightly took it</a>
<a id='line_16841'>up, and went to the water side; and there he bound the girdle about the</a>
<a id='line_16842'>hilts, and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might;</a>
<a id='line_16843'>and there came an arm and an hand above the water and met it, and</a>
<a id='line_16844'>caught it, and so shook it thrice and brandished, and then vanished</a>
<a id='line_16845'>away the hand with the sword in the water. So Sir Bedivere came again</a>
<a id='line_16846'>to the king, and told him what he saw. Alas, said the king, help me</a>
<a id='line_16847'>hence, for I dread me I have tarried over long. Then Sir Bedivere took</a>
<a id='line_16848'>the king upon his back, and so went with him to that water side. And</a>
<a id='line_16849'>when they were at the water side, even fast by the bank hoved a little</a>
<a id='line_16850'>barge with many fair ladies in it, and among them all was a queen, and</a>
<a id='line_16851'>all they had black hoods, and all they wept and shrieked when they saw</a>
<a id='line_16852'>King Arthur. Now put me into the barge, said the king. And so he did</a>
<a id='line_16853'>softly; and there received him three queens with great mourning; and so</a>
<a id='line_16854'>they set them down, and in one of their laps King Arthur laid his head.</a>
<a id='line_16855'>And then that queen said: Ah, dear brother, why have ye tarried so long</a>
<a id='line_16856'>from me? alas, this wound on your head hath caught over-much cold. And</a>
<a id='line_16857'>so then they rowed from the land, and Sir Bedivere beheld all those</a>
<a id='line_16858'>ladies go from him. Then Sir Bedivere cried: Ah my lord Arthur, what</a>
<a id='line_16859'>shall become of me, now ye go from me and leave me here alone among</a>
<a id='line_16860'>mine enemies? Comfort thyself, said the king, and do as well as thou</a>
<a id='line_16861'>mayst, for in me is no trust for to trust in; for I will into the vale</a>
<a id='line_16862'>of Avilion to heal me of my grievous wound: and if thou hear never more</a>
<a id='line_16863'>of me, pray for my soul. But ever the queens and ladies wept and</a>
<a id='line_16864'>shrieked, that it was pity to hear. And as soon as Sir Bedivere had</a>
<a id='line_16865'>lost the sight of the barge, he wept and wailed, and so took the</a>
<a id='line_16866'>forest; and so he went all that night, and in the morning he was ware</a>
<a id='line_16867'>betwixt two holts hoar, of a chapel and an hermitage.</a>
<a id='line_16868'></a>

<a id='line_16872'>CHAPTER VI. How Sir Bedivere found him on the morrow dead in an</a>
<a id='line_16873'>hermitage, and how he abode there with the hermit.</a>
<a id='line_16874'></a>
<a id='line_16875'></a>
<a id='line_16876'>Then was Sir Bedivere glad, and thither he went; and when he came into</a>
<a id='line_16877'>the chapel, he saw where lay an hermit grovelling on all four, there</a>
<a id='line_16878'>fast by a tomb was new graven. When the hermit saw Sir Bedivere he knew</a>
<a id='line_16879'>him well, for he was but little to-fore Bishop of Canterbury, that Sir</a>
<a id='line_16880'>Mordred flemed. Sir, said Bedivere, what man is there interred that ye</a>
<a id='line_16881'>pray so fast for? Fair son, said the hermit, I wot not verily, but by</a>
<a id='line_16882'>deeming. But this night, at midnight, here came a number of ladies, and</a>
<a id='line_16883'>brought hither a dead corpse, and prayed me to bury him; and here they</a>
<a id='line_16884'>offered an hundred tapers, and they gave me an hundred besants. Alas,</a>
<a id='line_16885'>said Sir Bedivere, that was my lord King Arthur, that here lieth buried</a>
<a id='line_16886'>in this chapel. Then Sir Bedivere swooned; and when he awoke he prayed</a>
<a id='line_16887'>the hermit he might abide with him still there, to live with fasting</a>
<a id='line_16888'>and prayers. For from hence will I never go, said Sir Bedivere, by my</a>
<a id='line_16889'>will, but all the days of my life here to pray for my lord Arthur. Ye</a>
<a id='line_16890'>are welcome to me, said the hermit, for I know ye better than ye ween</a>
<a id='line_16891'>that I do. Ye are the bold Bedivere, and the full noble duke, Sir Lucan</a>
<a id='line_16892'>the Butler, was your brother. Then Sir Bedivere told the hermit all as</a>
<a id='line_16893'>ye have heard to-fore. So there bode Sir Bedivere with the hermit that</a>
<a id='line_16894'>was to-fore Bishop of Canterbury, and there Sir Bedivere put upon him</a>
<a id='line_16895'>poor clothes, and served the hermit full lowly in fasting and in</a>
<a id='line_16896'>prayers.</a>
<a id='line_16897'></a>
<a id='line_16898'>Thus of Arthur I find never more written in books that be authorised,</a>
<a id='line_16899'>nor more of the very certainty of his death heard I never read, but</a>
<a id='line_16900'>thus was he led away in a ship wherein were three queens; that one was</a>
<a id='line_16901'>King Arthur’s sister, Queen Morgan le Fay; the other was the Queen of</a>
<a id='line_16902'>Northgalis; the third was the Queen of the Waste Lands. Also there was</a>
<a id='line_16903'>Nimue, the chief lady of the lake, that had wedded Pelleas the good</a>
<a id='line_16904'>knight; and this lady had done much for King Arthur, for she would</a>
<a id='line_16905'>never suffer Sir Pelleas to be in no place where he should be in danger</a>
<a id='line_16906'>of his life; and so he lived to the uttermost of his days with her in</a>
<a id='line_16907'>great rest. More of the death of King Arthur could I never find, but</a>
<a id='line_16908'>that ladies brought him to his burials; and such one was buried there,</a>
<a id='line_16909'>that the hermit bare witness that sometime was Bishop of Canterbury,</a>
<a id='line_16910'>but yet the hermit knew not in certain that he was verily the body of</a>
<a id='line_16911'>King Arthur: for this tale Sir Bedivere, knight of the Table Round,</a>
<a id='line_16912'>made it to be written.</a>

<a id='line_16919'></a>
<a id='line_16920'></a>
<a id='line_16921'>Yet some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead,</a>
<a id='line_16922'>but had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say</a>
<a id='line_16923'>that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I will not</a>
<a id='line_16924'>say it shall be so, but rather I will say: here in this world he</a>
<a id='line_16925'>changed his life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb</a>
<a id='line_16926'>this verse: _Hic jacet Arthurus, Rex quondam, Rexque futurus._ Thus</a>
<a id='line_16927'>leave I here Sir Bedivere with the hermit, that dwelled that time in a</a>
<a id='line_16928'>chapel beside Glastonbury, and there was his hermitage. And so they</a>
<a id='line_16929'>lived in their prayers, and fastings, and great abstinence. And when</a>
<a id='line_16930'>Queen Guenever understood that King Arthur was slain, and all the noble</a>
<a id='line_16931'>knights, Sir Mordred and all the remnant, then the queen stole away,</a>
<a id='line_16932'>and five ladies with her, and so she went to Almesbury; and there she</a>
<a id='line_16933'>let make herself a nun, and ware white clothes and black, and great</a>
<a id='line_16934'>penance she took, as ever did sinful lady in this land, and never</a>
<a id='line_16935'>creature could make her merry; but lived in fasting, prayers, and</a>
<a id='line_16936'>alms-deeds, that all manner of people marvelled how virtuously she was</a>
<a id='line_16937'>changed. Now leave we Queen Guenever in Almesbury, a nun in white</a>
<a id='line_16938'>clothes and black, and there she was Abbess and ruler as reason would;</a>

<a id='line_16945'>and of Sir Gawaine, and other matters, he came into England.</a>
<a id='line_16946'></a>
<a id='line_16947'></a>
<a id='line_16948'>And when he heard in his country that Sir Mordred was crowned king in</a>
<a id='line_16949'>England, and made war against King Arthur, his own father, and would</a>
<a id='line_16950'>let him to land in his own land; also it was told Sir Launcelot how</a>
<a id='line_16951'>that Sir Mordred had laid siege about the Tower of London, because the</a>
<a id='line_16952'>queen would not wed him; then was Sir Launcelot wroth out of measure,</a>
<a id='line_16953'>and said to his kinsmen: Alas, that double traitor Sir Mordred, now me</a>
<a id='line_16954'>repenteth that ever he escaped my hands, for much shame hath he done</a>
<a id='line_16955'>unto my lord Arthur; for all I feel by the doleful letter that my lord</a>
<a id='line_16956'>Sir Gawaine sent me, on whose soul Jesu have mercy that my lord Arthur</a>
<a id='line_16957'>is full hard bestead. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that ever I should live</a>
<a id='line_16958'>to hear that most noble king that made me knight thus to be overset</a>
<a id='line_16959'>with his subject in his own realm. And this doleful letter that my</a>
<a id='line_16960'>lord, Sir Gawaine, hath sent me afore his death, praying me to see his</a>
<a id='line_16961'>tomb, wit you well his doleful words shall never go from mine heart,</a>
<a id='line_16962'>for he was a full noble knight as ever was born; and in an unhappy hour</a>
<a id='line_16963'>was I born that ever I should have that unhap to slay first Sir</a>
<a id='line_16964'>Gawaine, Sir Gaheris the good knight, and mine own friend Sir Gareth,</a>
<a id='line_16965'>that full noble knight. Alas, I may say I am unhappy, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_16966'>Launcelot, that ever I should do thus unhappily, and, alas, yet might I</a>
<a id='line_16967'>never have hap to slay that traitor, Sir Mordred.</a>
<a id='line_16968'></a>
<a id='line_16969'>Leave your complaints, said Sir Bors, and first revenge you of the</a>
<a id='line_16970'>death of Sir Gawaine; and it will be well done that ye see Sir</a>
<a id='line_16971'>Gawaine’s tomb, and secondly that ye revenge my lord Arthur, and my</a>
<a id='line_16972'>lady, Queen Guenever. I thank you, said Sir Launcelot, for ever ye will</a>
<a id='line_16973'>my worship.</a>
<a id='line_16974'></a>
<a id='line_16975'>Then they made them ready in all the haste that might be, with ships</a>
<a id='line_16976'>and galleys, with Sir Launcelot and his host to pass into England. And</a>
<a id='line_16977'>so he passed over the sea till he came to Dover, and there he landed</a>
<a id='line_16978'>with seven kings, and the number was hideous to behold. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_16979'>Launcelot spered of men of Dover where was King Arthur become. Then the</a>
<a id='line_16980'>people told him how that he was slain, and Sir Mordred and an hundred</a>
<a id='line_16981'>thousand died on a day; and how Sir Mordred gave King Arthur there the</a>
<a id='line_16982'>first battle at his landing, and there was good Sir Gawaine slain; and</a>
<a id='line_16983'>on the morn Sir Mordred fought with the king upon Barham Down, and</a>
<a id='line_16984'>there the king put Sir Mordred to the worse. Alas, said Sir Launcelot,</a>
<a id='line_16985'>this is the heaviest tidings that ever came to me. Now, fair sirs, said</a>
<a id='line_16986'>Sir Launcelot, shew me the tomb of Sir Gawaine. And then certain people</a>
<a id='line_16987'>of the town brought him into the castle of Dover, and shewed him the</a>
<a id='line_16988'>tomb. Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down and wept, and prayed heartily for</a>
<a id='line_16989'>his soul. And that night he made a dole, and all they that would come</a>
<a id='line_16990'>had as much flesh, fish, wine and ale, and every man and woman had</a>
<a id='line_16991'>twelve pence, come who would. Thus with his own hand dealt he this</a>
<a id='line_16992'>money, in a mourning gown; and ever he wept, and prayed them to pray</a>
<a id='line_16993'>for the soul of Sir Gawaine. And on the morn all the priests and clerks</a>
<a id='line_16994'>that might be gotten in the country were there, and sang mass of</a>
<a id='line_16995'>Requiem; and there offered first Sir Launcelot, and he offered an</a>
<a id='line_16996'>hundred pound; and then the seven kings offered forty pound apiece; and</a>
<a id='line_16997'>also there was a thousand knights, and each of them offered a pound;</a>
<a id='line_16998'>and the offering dured from morn till night, and Sir Launcelot lay two</a>
<a id='line_16999'>nights on his tomb in prayers and weeping.</a>
<a id='line_17000'></a>
<a id='line_17001'>Then on the third day Sir Launcelot called the kings, dukes, earls,</a>
<a id='line_17002'>barons, and knights, and said thus: My fair lords, I thank you all of</a>
<a id='line_17003'>your coming into this country with me, but we came too late, and that</a>
<a id='line_17004'>shall repent me while I live, but against death may no man rebel. But</a>
<a id='line_17005'>sithen it is so, said Sir Launcelot, I will myself ride and seek my</a>
<a id='line_17006'>lady, Queen Guenever, for as I hear say she hath had great pain and</a>
<a id='line_17007'>much disease; and I heard say that she is fled into the west. Therefore</a>
<a id='line_17008'>ye all shall abide me here, and but if I come again within fifteen</a>
<a id='line_17009'>days, then take your ships and your fellowship, and depart into your</a>
<a id='line_17010'>country, for I will do as I say to you.</a>

<a id='line_17017'></a>

<a id='line_17019'>Then came Sir Bors de Ganis, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, what</a>
<a id='line_17020'>think ye for to do, now to ride in this realm? wit ye well ye shall</a>
<a id='line_17021'>find few friends. Be as be may, said Sir Launcelot, keep you still</a>
<a id='line_17022'>here, for I will forth on my journey, and no man nor child shall go</a>
<a id='line_17023'>with me. So it was no boot to strive, but he departed and rode</a>
<a id='line_17024'>westerly, and there he sought a seven or eight days; and at the last he</a>
<a id='line_17025'>came to a nunnery, and then was Queen Guenever ware of Sir Launcelot as</a>
<a id='line_17026'>he walked in the cloister. And when she saw him there she swooned</a>
<a id='line_17027'>thrice, that all the ladies and gentlewomen had work enough to hold the</a>
<a id='line_17028'>queen up. So when she might speak, she called ladies and gentlewomen to</a>
<a id='line_17029'>her, and said: Ye marvel, fair ladies, why I make this fare. Truly, she</a>
<a id='line_17030'>said, it is for the sight of yonder knight that yonder standeth;</a>
<a id='line_17031'>wherefore I pray you all call him to me.</a>
<a id='line_17032'></a>
<a id='line_17033'>When Sir Launcelot was brought to her, then she said to all the ladies:</a>
<a id='line_17034'>Through this man and me hath all this war been wrought, and the death</a>
<a id='line_17035'>of the most noblest knights of the world; for through our love that we</a>
<a id='line_17036'>have loved together is my most noble lord slain. Therefore, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17037'>Launcelot, wit thou well I am set in such a plight to get my soul-heal;</a>
<a id='line_17038'>and yet I trust through God’s grace that after my death to have a sight</a>
<a id='line_17039'>of the blessed face of Christ, and at domesday to sit on his right</a>
<a id='line_17040'>side, for as sinful as ever I was are saints in heaven. Therefore, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17041'>Launcelot, I require thee and beseech thee heartily, for all the love</a>
<a id='line_17042'>that ever was betwixt us, that thou never see me more in the visage;</a>
<a id='line_17043'>and I command thee, on God’s behalf, that thou forsake my company, and</a>
<a id='line_17044'>to thy kingdom thou turn again, and keep well thy realm from war and</a>
<a id='line_17045'>wrack; for as well as I have loved thee, mine heart will not serve me</a>
<a id='line_17046'>to see thee, for through thee and me is the flower of kings and knights</a>
<a id='line_17047'>destroyed; therefore, Sir Launcelot, go to thy realm, and there take</a>
<a id='line_17048'>thee a wife, and live with her with joy and bliss; and I pray thee</a>
<a id='line_17049'>heartily, pray for me to our Lord that I may amend my misliving. Now,</a>
<a id='line_17050'>sweet madam, said Sir Launcelot, would ye that I should now return</a>
<a id='line_17051'>again unto my country, and there to wed a lady? Nay, madam, wit you</a>
<a id='line_17052'>well that shall I never do, for I shall never be so false to you of</a>
<a id='line_17053'>that I have promised; but the same destiny that ye have taken you to, I</a>
<a id='line_17054'>will take me unto, for to please Jesu, and ever for you I cast me</a>
<a id='line_17055'>specially to pray. If thou wilt do so, said the queen, hold thy</a>
<a id='line_17056'>promise, but I may never believe but that thou wilt turn to the world</a>
<a id='line_17057'>again. Well, madam, said he, ye say as pleaseth you, yet wist you me</a>
<a id='line_17058'>never false of my promise, and God defend but I should forsake the</a>
<a id='line_17059'>world as ye have done. For in the quest of the Sangreal I had forsaken</a>
<a id='line_17060'>the vanities of the world had not your lord been. And if I had done so</a>
<a id='line_17061'>at that time, with my heart, will, and thought, I had passed all the</a>
<a id='line_17062'>knights that were in the Sangreal except Sir Galahad, my son. And</a>
<a id='line_17063'>therefore, lady, sithen ye have taken you to perfection, I must needs</a>
<a id='line_17064'>take me to perfection, of right. For I take record of God, in you I</a>
<a id='line_17065'>have had mine earthly joy; and if I had found you now so disposed, I</a>
<a id='line_17066'>had cast me to have had you into mine own realm.</a>

<a id='line_17078'>madam, I pray you kiss me and never no more. Nay, said the queen, that</a>
<a id='line_17079'>shall I never do, but abstain you from such works: and they departed.</a>
<a id='line_17080'>But there was never so hard an hearted man but he would have wept to</a>
<a id='line_17081'>see the dolour that they made; for there was lamentation as they had</a>

<a id='line_17083'>bare the queen to her chamber.</a>
<a id='line_17084'></a>
<a id='line_17085'>And Sir Launcelot awoke, and went and took his horse, and rode all that</a>

<a id='line_17087'>an hermitage and a chapel stood betwixt two cliffs; and then he heard a</a>
<a id='line_17088'>little bell ring to mass, and thither he rode and alighted, and tied</a>
<a id='line_17089'>his horse to the gate, and heard mass. And he that sang mass was the</a>
<a id='line_17090'>Bishop of Canterbury. Both the Bishop and Sir Bedivere knew Sir</a>
<a id='line_17091'>Launcelot, and they spake together after mass. But when Sir Bedivere</a>
<a id='line_17092'>had told his tale all whole, Sir Launcelot’s heart almost brast for</a>
<a id='line_17093'>sorrow, and Sir Launcelot threw his arms abroad, and said: Alas, who</a>
<a id='line_17094'>may trust this world. And then he kneeled down on his knee, and prayed</a>
<a id='line_17095'>the Bishop to shrive him and assoil him. And then he besought the</a>
<a id='line_17096'>Bishop that he might be his brother. Then the Bishop said: I will</a>
<a id='line_17097'>gladly; and there he put an habit upon Sir Launcelot, and there he</a>
<a id='line_17098'>served God day and night with prayers and fastings.</a>
<a id='line_17099'></a>
<a id='line_17100'>Thus the great host abode at Dover. And then Sir Lionel took fifteen</a>
<a id='line_17101'>lords with him, and rode to London to seek Sir Launcelot; and there Sir</a>
<a id='line_17102'>Lionel was slain and many of his lords. Then Sir Bors de Ganis made the</a>
<a id='line_17103'>great host for to go home again; and Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17104'>Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, with more other of Sir Launcelot’s kin, took on</a>
<a id='line_17105'>them to ride all England overthwart and endlong, to seek Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_17106'>So Sir Bors by fortune rode so long till he came to the same chapel</a>
<a id='line_17107'>where Sir Launcelot was; and so Sir Bors heard a little bell knell,</a>
<a id='line_17108'>that rang to mass; and there he alighted and heard mass. And when mass</a>
<a id='line_17109'>was done, the Bishop Sir Launcelot, and Sir Bedivere, came to Sir Bors.</a>
<a id='line_17110'>And when Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot in that manner clothing, then he</a>
<a id='line_17111'>prayed the Bishop that he might be in the same suit. And so there was</a>
<a id='line_17112'>an habit put upon him, and there he lived in prayers and fasting. And</a>
<a id='line_17113'>within half a year, there was come Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17114'>Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Villiars, Sir Clarras, and Sir Gahalantine.</a>
<a id='line_17115'>So all these seven noble knights there abode still. And when they saw</a>
<a id='line_17116'>Sir Launcelot had taken him to such perfection, they had no lust to</a>
<a id='line_17117'>depart, but took such an habit as he had.</a>
<a id='line_17118'></a>
<a id='line_17119'>Thus they endured in great penance six year; and then Sir Launcelot</a>
<a id='line_17120'>took the habit of priesthood of the Bishop, and a twelvemonth he sang</a>
<a id='line_17121'>mass. And there was none of these other knights but they read in books,</a>
<a id='line_17122'>and holp for to sing mass, and rang bells, and did bodily all manner of</a>
<a id='line_17123'>service. And so their horses went where they would, for they took no</a>
<a id='line_17124'>regard of no worldly riches. For when they saw Sir Launcelot endure</a>
<a id='line_17125'>such penance, in prayers, and fastings, they took no force what pain</a>
<a id='line_17126'>they endured, for to see the noblest knight of the world take such</a>
<a id='line_17127'>abstinence that he waxed full lean. And thus upon a night, there came a</a>
<a id='line_17128'>vision to Sir Launcelot, and charged him, in remission of his sins, to</a>
<a id='line_17129'>haste him unto Almesbury: And by then thou come there, thou shalt find</a>
<a id='line_17130'>Queen Guenever dead. And therefore take thy fellows with thee, and</a>
<a id='line_17131'>purvey them of an horse bier, and fetch thou the corpse of her, and</a>
<a id='line_17132'>bury her by her husband, the noble King Arthur. So this avision came to</a>
<a id='line_17133'>Sir Launcelot thrice in one night.</a>
<a id='line_17134'></a>
<a id='line_17135'></a>
<a id='line_17136'></a>
<a id='line_17137'></a>
<a id='line_17138'>CHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot went with his seven fellows to Almesbury,</a>
<a id='line_17139'>and found there Queen Guenever dead, whom they brought to Glastonbury.</a>
<a id='line_17140'></a>
<a id='line_17141'></a>
<a id='line_17142'>Then Sir Launcelot rose up or day, and told the hermit. It were well</a>
<a id='line_17143'>done, said the hermit, that ye made you ready, and that you disobey not</a>
<a id='line_17144'>the avision. Then Sir Launcelot took his eight fellows with him, and on</a>
<a id='line_17145'>foot they yede from Glastonbury to Almesbury, the which is little more</a>
<a id='line_17146'>than thirty mile. And thither they came within two days, for they were</a>
<a id='line_17147'>weak and feeble to go. And when Sir Launcelot was come to Almesbury</a>
<a id='line_17148'>within the nunnery, Queen Guenever died but half an hour afore. And the</a>
<a id='line_17149'>ladies told Sir Launcelot that Queen Guenever told them all or she</a>
<a id='line_17150'>passed, that Sir Launcelot had been priest near a twelvemonth, And</a>
<a id='line_17151'>hither he cometh as fast as he may to fetch my corpse; and beside my</a>
<a id='line_17152'>lord, King Arthur, he shall bury me. Wherefore the queen said in</a>
<a id='line_17153'>hearing of them all: I beseech Almighty God that I may never have power</a>
<a id='line_17154'>to see Sir Launcelot with my worldly eyen; and thus, said all the</a>
<a id='line_17155'>ladies, was ever her prayer these two days, till she was dead. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_17156'>Launcelot saw her visage, but he wept not greatly, but sighed. And so</a>
<a id='line_17157'>he did all the observance of the service himself, both the dirige, and</a>
<a id='line_17158'>on the morn he sang mass. And there was ordained an horse bier; and so</a>
<a id='line_17159'>with an hundred torches ever brenning about the corpse of the queen,</a>
<a id='line_17160'>and ever Sir Launcelot with his eight fellows went about the horse</a>
<a id='line_17161'>bier, singing and reading many an holy orison, and frankincense upon</a>
<a id='line_17162'>the corpse incensed. Thus Sir Launcelot and his eight fellows went on</a>
<a id='line_17163'>foot from Almesbury unto Glastonbury.</a>
<a id='line_17164'></a>
<a id='line_17165'>And when they were come to the chapel and the hermitage, there she had</a>
<a id='line_17166'>a dirige, with great devotion. And on the morn the hermit that sometime</a>
<a id='line_17167'>was Bishop of Canterbury sang the mass of Requiem with great devotion.</a>
<a id='line_17168'>And Sir Launcelot was the first that offered, and then also his eight</a>
<a id='line_17169'>fellows. And then she was wrapped in cered cloth of Raines, from the</a>
<a id='line_17170'>top to the toe, in thirtyfold, and after she was put in a web of lead,</a>
<a id='line_17171'>and then in a coffin of marble. And when she was put in the earth Sir</a>
<a id='line_17172'>Launcelot swooned, and lay long still, while the hermit came and awaked</a>
<a id='line_17173'>him, and said: Ye be to blame, for ye displease God with such manner of</a>
<a id='line_17174'>sorrow-making. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I trust I do not displease</a>
<a id='line_17175'>God, for He knoweth mine intent. For my sorrow was not, nor is not for</a>
<a id='line_17176'>any rejoicing of sin, but my sorrow may never have end. For when I</a>
<a id='line_17177'>remember of her beauty, and of her noblesse, that was both with her</a>
<a id='line_17178'>king and with her, so when I saw his corpse and her corpse so lie</a>
<a id='line_17179'>together, truly mine heart would not serve to sustain my careful body.</a>
<a id='line_17180'>Also when I remember me how by my default, mine orgule and my pride,</a>
<a id='line_17181'>that they were both laid full low, that were peerless that ever was</a>
<a id='line_17182'>living of Christian people, wit you well, said Sir Launcelot, this</a>
<a id='line_17183'>remembered, of their kindness and mine unkindness, sank so to mine</a>
<a id='line_17184'>heart, that I might not sustain myself. So the French book maketh</a>
<a id='line_17185'>mention.</a>
<a id='line_17186'></a>
<a id='line_17187'></a>
<a id='line_17188'></a>
<a id='line_17189'></a>
<a id='line_17190'>CHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot began to sicken, and after died, whose</a>
<a id='line_17191'>body was borne to Joyous Gard for to be buried.</a>
<a id='line_17192'></a>
<a id='line_17193'></a>
<a id='line_17194'>Then Sir Launcelot never after ate but little meat, ne drank, till he</a>
<a id='line_17195'>was dead. For then he sickened more and more, and dried, and dwined</a>
<a id='line_17196'>away. For the Bishop nor none of his fellows might not make him to eat,</a>
<a id='line_17197'>and little he drank, that he was waxen by a cubit shorter than he was,</a>
<a id='line_17198'>that the people could not know him. For evermore, day and night, he</a>
<a id='line_17199'>prayed, but sometime he slumbered a broken sleep; ever he was lying</a>
<a id='line_17200'>grovelling on the tomb of King Arthur and Queen Guenever. And there was</a>
<a id='line_17201'>no comfort that the Bishop, nor Sir Bors, nor none of his fellows,</a>
<a id='line_17202'>could make him, it availed not. So within six weeks after, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17203'>Launcelot fell sick, and lay in his bed; and then he sent for the</a>
<a id='line_17204'>Bishop that there was hermit, and all his true fellows. Then Sir</a>
<a id='line_17205'>Launcelot said with dreary steven: Sir Bishop, I pray you give to me</a>
<a id='line_17206'>all my rites that longeth to a Christian man. It shall not need you,</a>
<a id='line_17207'>said the hermit and all his fellows, it is but heaviness of your blood,</a>
<a id='line_17208'>ye shall be well mended by the grace of God to-morn. My fair lords,</a>
<a id='line_17209'>said Sir Launcelot, wit you well my careful body will into the earth, I</a>
<a id='line_17210'>have warning more than now I will say; therefore give me my rites. So</a>
<a id='line_17211'>when he was houseled and anealed, and had all that a Christian man</a>
<a id='line_17212'>ought to have, he prayed the Bishop that his fellows might bear his</a>
<a id='line_17213'>body to Joyous Gard. Some men say it was Alnwick, and some men say it</a>
<a id='line_17214'>was Bamborough. Howbeit, said Sir Launcelot, me repenteth sore, but I</a>
<a id='line_17215'>made mine avow sometime, that in Joyous Gard I would be buried. And</a>
<a id='line_17216'>because of breaking of mine avow, I pray you all, lead me thither. Then</a>
<a id='line_17217'>there was weeping and wringing of hands among his fellows.</a>
<a id='line_17218'></a>
<a id='line_17219'>So at a season of the night they all went to their beds, for they all</a>
<a id='line_17220'>lay in one chamber. And so after midnight, against day, the Bishop</a>
<a id='line_17221'>[that] then was hermit, as he lay in his bed asleep, he fell upon a</a>
<a id='line_17222'>great laughter. And therewith all the fellowship awoke, and came to the</a>
<a id='line_17223'>Bishop, and asked him what he ailed. Ah Jesu mercy, said the Bishop,</a>
<a id='line_17224'>why did ye awake me? I was never in all my life so merry and so well at</a>
<a id='line_17225'>ease. Wherefore? said Sir Bors. Truly said the Bishop, here was Sir</a>
<a id='line_17226'>Launcelot with me with mo angels than ever I saw men in one day. And I</a>
<a id='line_17227'>saw the angels heave up Sir Launcelot unto heaven, and the gates of</a>
<a id='line_17228'>heaven opened against him. It is but dretching of swevens, said Sir</a>
<a id='line_17229'>Bors, for I doubt not Sir Launcelot aileth nothing but good. It may</a>
<a id='line_17230'>well be, said the Bishop; go ye to his bed, and then shall ye prove the</a>
<a id='line_17231'>sooth. So when Sir Bors and his fellows came to his bed they found him</a>
<a id='line_17232'>stark dead, and he lay as he had smiled, and the sweetest savour about</a>
<a id='line_17233'>him that ever they felt.</a>
<a id='line_17234'></a>
<a id='line_17235'>Then was there weeping and wringing of hands, and the greatest dole</a>
<a id='line_17236'>they made that ever made men. And on the morn the Bishop did his mass</a>
<a id='line_17237'>of Requiem, and after, the Bishop and all the nine knights put Sir</a>
<a id='line_17238'>Launcelot in the same horse bier that Queen Guenever was laid in</a>
<a id='line_17239'>to-fore that she was buried. And so the Bishop and they all together</a>
<a id='line_17240'>went with the body of Sir Launcelot daily, till they came to Joyous</a>
<a id='line_17241'>Gard; and ever they had an hundred torches brenning about him. And so</a>
<a id='line_17242'>within fifteen days they came to Joyous Gard. And there they laid his</a>
<a id='line_17243'>corpse in the body of the quire, and sang and read many psalters and</a>
<a id='line_17244'>prayers over him and about him.</a>
<a id='line_17245'></a>
<a id='line_17246'>And ever his visage was laid open and naked, that all folks might</a>
<a id='line_17247'>behold him. For such was the custom in those days, that all men of</a>
<a id='line_17248'>worship should so lie with open visage till that they were buried. And</a>
<a id='line_17249'>right thus as they were at their service, there came Sir Ector de</a>
<a id='line_17250'>Maris, that had seven years sought all England, Scotland, and Wales,</a>
<a id='line_17251'>seeking his brother, Sir Launcelot.</a>
<a id='line_17252'></a>
<a id='line_17253'></a>
<a id='line_17254'></a>
<a id='line_17255'></a>
<a id='line_17256'>CHAPTER XIII. How Sir Ector found Sir Launcelot his brother dead, and</a>
<a id='line_17257'>how Constantine reigned next after Arthur; and of the end of this book.</a>
<a id='line_17258'></a>
<a id='line_17259'></a>
<a id='line_17260'>And when Sir Ector heard such noise and light in the quire of Joyous</a>
<a id='line_17261'>Gard, he alighted and put his horse from him, and came into the quire,</a>
<a id='line_17262'>and there he saw men sing and weep. And all they knew Sir Ector, but he</a>
<a id='line_17263'>knew not them. Then went Sir Bors unto Sir Ector, and told him how</a>
<a id='line_17264'>there lay his brother, Sir Launcelot, dead; and then Sir Ector threw</a>
<a id='line_17265'>his shield, sword, and helm from him. And when he beheld Sir</a>
<a id='line_17266'>Launcelot’s visage, he fell down in a swoon. And when he waked it were</a>
<a id='line_17267'>hard any tongue to tell the doleful complaints that he made for his</a>
<a id='line_17268'>brother. Ah Launcelot, he said, thou were head of all Christian</a>
<a id='line_17269'>knights, and now I dare say, said Sir Ector, thou Sir Launcelot, there</a>
<a id='line_17270'>thou liest, that thou were never matched of earthly knight’s hand. And</a>
<a id='line_17271'>thou were the courteoust knight that ever bare shield. And thou were</a>
<a id='line_17272'>the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrad horse. And thou were</a>
<a id='line_17273'>the truest lover of a sinful man that ever loved woman. And thou were</a>
<a id='line_17274'>the kindest man that ever struck with sword. And thou were the</a>
<a id='line_17275'>goodliest person that ever came among press of knights. And thou was</a>
<a id='line_17276'>the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among ladies.</a>
<a id='line_17277'>And thou were the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever put spear</a>
<a id='line_17278'>in the rest. Then there was weeping and dolour out of measure.</a>
<a id='line_17279'></a>
<a id='line_17280'>Thus they kept Sir Launcelot’s corpse aloft fifteen days, and then they</a>
<a id='line_17281'>buried it with great devotion. And then at leisure they went all with</a>
<a id='line_17282'>the Bishop of Canterbury to his hermitage, and there they were together</a>
<a id='line_17283'>more than a month. Then Sir Constantine, that was Sir Cador’s son of</a>
<a id='line_17284'>Cornwall, was chosen king of England. And he was a full noble knight,</a>
<a id='line_17285'>and worshipfully he ruled this realm. And then this King Constantine</a>
<a id='line_17286'>sent for the Bishop of Canterbury, for he heard say where he was. And</a>
<a id='line_17287'>so he was restored unto his Bishopric, and left that hermitage. And Sir</a>
<a id='line_17288'>Bedivere was there ever still hermit to his life’s end. Then Sir Bors</a>
<a id='line_17289'>de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Gahalantine, Sir Galihud, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17290'>Galihodin, Sir Blamore, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Villiars le Valiant, Sir</a>
<a id='line_17291'>Clarrus of Clermont, all these knights drew them to their countries.</a>
<a id='line_17292'>Howbeit King Constantine would have had them with him, but they would</a>
<a id='line_17293'>not abide in this realm. And there they all lived in their countries as</a>
<a id='line_17294'>holy men. And some English books make mention that they went never out</a>
<a id='line_17295'>of England after the death of Sir Launcelot, but that was but favour of</a>
<a id='line_17296'>makers. For the French book maketh mention, and is authorised, that Sir</a>
<a id='line_17297'>Bors, Sir Ector, Sir Blamore, and Sir Bleoberis, went into the Holy</a>
<a id='line_17298'>Land thereas Jesu Christ was quick and dead, and anon as they had</a>
<a id='line_17299'>stablished their lands. For the book saith, so Sir Launcelot commanded</a>
<a id='line_17300'>them for to do, or ever he passed out of this world. And these four</a>
<a id='line_17301'>knights did many battles upon the miscreants or Turks. And there they</a>
<a id='line_17302'>died upon a Good Friday for God’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_17303'></a>
<a id='line_17304'>_Here is the end of the book of King Arthur, and of his noble knights</a>
<a id='line_17305'>of the Round Table, that when they were whole together there was ever</a>
