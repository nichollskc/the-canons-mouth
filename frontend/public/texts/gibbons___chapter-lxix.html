<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      In the first ages of the decline and fall of the Roman empire,</a>
<a id='line_10'>      our eye is invariably fixed on the royal city, which had given</a>
<a id='line_11'>      laws to the fairest portion of the globe. We contemplate her</a>
<a id='line_12'>      fortunes, at first with admiration, at length with pity, always</a>
<a id='line_13'>      with attention, and when that attention is diverted from the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      capital to the provinces, they are considered as so many branches</a>
<a id='line_15'>      which have been successively severed from the Imperial trunk. The</a>
<a id='line_16'>      foundation of a second Rome, on the shores of the Bosphorus, has</a>
<a id='line_17'>      compelled the historian to follow the successors of Constantine;</a>
<a id='line_18'>      and our curiosity has been tempted to visit the most remote</a>
<a id='line_19'>      countries of Europe and Asia, to explore the causes and the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      authors of the long decay of the Byzantine monarchy. By the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      conquest of Justinian, we have been recalled to the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      Tyber, to the deliverance of the ancient metropolis; but that</a>
<a id='line_23'>      deliverance was a change, or perhaps an aggravation, of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      servitude. Rome had been already stripped of her trophies, her</a>
<a id='line_25'>      gods, and her Cæsars; nor was the Gothic dominion more inglorious</a>
<a id='line_26'>      and oppressive than the tyranny of the Greeks. In the eighth</a>
<a id='line_27'>      century of the Christian æra, a religious quarrel, the worship of</a>
<a id='line_28'>      images, provoked the Romans to assert their independence: their</a>
<a id='line_29'>      bishop became the temporal, as well as the spiritual, father of a</a>
<a id='line_30'>      free people; and of the Western empire, which was restored by</a>
<a id='line_31'>      Charlemagne, the title and image still decorate the singular</a>
<a id='line_32'>      constitution of modern Germany. The name of Rome must yet command</a>
<a id='line_33'>      our involuntary respect: the climate (whatsoever may be its</a>
<a id='line_34'>      influence) was no longer the same: 1 the purity of blood had been</a>
<a id='line_35'>      contaminated through a thousand channels; but the venerable</a>
<a id='line_36'>      aspect of her ruins, and the memory of past greatness, rekindled</a>
<a id='line_37'>      a spark of the national character. The darkness of the middle</a>
<a id='line_38'>      ages exhibits some scenes not unworthy of our notice. Nor shall I</a>
<a id='line_39'>      dismiss the present work till I have reviewed the state and</a>
<a id='line_40'>      revolutions of the Roman City, which acquiesced under the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      absolute dominion of the popes, about the same time that</a>
<a id='line_42'>      Constantinople was enslaved by the Turkish arms.</a>

<a id='line_45'>      successor Montesquieu, has asserted and magnified the influence</a>
<a id='line_46'>      of climate, objects to himself the degeneracy of the Romans and</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Batavians. To the first of these examples he replies, 1. That the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      change is less real than apparent, and that the modern Romans</a>
<a id='line_49'>      prudently conceal in themselves the virtues of their ancestors.</a>
<a id='line_50'>      2. That the air, the soil, and the climate of Rome have suffered</a>
<a id='line_51'>      a great and visible alteration, (Réflexions sur la Poësie et sur</a>
<a id='line_52'>      la Peinture, part ii. sect. 16.) * Note: This question is</a>
<a id='line_53'>      discussed at considerable length in Dr. Arnold’s History of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_54'>      ch. xxiii. See likewise Bunsen’s Dissertation on the Aria Cattiva</a>
<a id='line_55'>      Roms Beschreibung, pp. 82, 108.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_56'></a>
<a id='line_57'>      In the beginning of the twelfth century, 2 the æra of the first</a>
<a id='line_58'>      crusade, Rome was revered by the Latins, as the metropolis of the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      world, as the throne of the pope and the emperor, who, from the</a>
<a id='line_60'>      eternal city, derived their title, their honors, and the right or</a>
<a id='line_61'>      exercise of temporal dominion. After so long an interruption, it</a>
<a id='line_62'>      may not be useless to repeat that the successors of Charlemagne</a>
<a id='line_63'>      and the Othos were chosen beyond the Rhine in a national diet;</a>
<a id='line_64'>      but that these princes were content with the humble names of</a>
<a id='line_65'>      kings of Germany and Italy, till they had passed the Alps and the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      Apennine, to seek their Imperial crown on the banks of the Tyber.</a>
<a id='line_67'>      3 At some distance from the city, their approach was saluted by a</a>
<a id='line_68'>      long procession of the clergy and people with palms and crosses;</a>
<a id='line_69'>      and the terrific emblems of wolves and lions, of dragons and</a>
<a id='line_70'>      eagles, that floated in the military banners, represented the</a>
<a id='line_71'>      departed legions and cohorts of the republic. The royal path to</a>
<a id='line_72'>      maintain the liberties of Rome was thrice reiterated, at the</a>
<a id='line_73'>      bridge, the gate, and on the stairs of the Vatican; and the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      distribution of a customary donative feebly imitated the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      magnificence of the first Cæsars. In the church of St. Peter, the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      coronation was performed by his successor: the voice of God was</a>
<a id='line_77'>      confounded with that of the people; and the public consent was</a>
<a id='line_78'>      declared in the acclamations of “Long life and victory to our</a>
<a id='line_79'>      lord the pope! long life and victory to our lord the emperor!</a>
<a id='line_80'>      long life and victory to the Roman and Teutonic armies!” 4 The</a>
<a id='line_81'>      names of Cæsar and Augustus, the laws of Constantine and</a>
<a id='line_82'>      Justinian, the example of Charlemagne and Otho, established the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      supreme dominion of the emperors: their title and image was</a>
<a id='line_84'>      engraved on the papal coins; 5 and their jurisdiction was marked</a>
<a id='line_85'>      by the sword of justice, which they delivered to the præfect of</a>
<a id='line_86'>      the city. But every Roman prejudice was awakened by the name, the</a>
<a id='line_87'>      language, and the manners, of a Barbarian lord. The Cæsars of</a>
<a id='line_88'>      Saxony or Franconia were the chiefs of a feudal aristocracy; nor</a>
<a id='line_89'>      could they exercise the discipline of civil and military power,</a>
<a id='line_90'>      which alone secures the obedience of a distant people, impatient</a>
<a id='line_91'>      of servitude, though perhaps incapable of freedom. Once, and once</a>
<a id='line_92'>      only, in his life, each emperor, with an army of Teutonic</a>
<a id='line_93'>      vassals, descended from the Alps. I have described the peaceful</a>
<a id='line_94'>      order of his entry and coronation; but that order was commonly</a>
<a id='line_95'>      disturbed by the clamor and sedition of the Romans, who</a>
<a id='line_96'>      encountered their sovereign as a foreign invader: his departure</a>
<a id='line_97'>      was always speedy, and often shameful; and, in the absence of a</a>
<a id='line_98'>      long reign, his authority was insulted, and his name was</a>
<a id='line_99'>      forgotten. The progress of independence in Germany and Italy</a>
<a id='line_100'>      undermined the foundations of the Imperial sovereignty, and the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      triumph of the popes was the deliverance of Rome.</a>

<a id='line_119'>      5 (return) [ Muratori has given the series of the papal coins,</a>

<a id='line_121'>      more early than the year 800: fifty are still extant from Leo</a>
<a id='line_122'>      III. to Leo IX., with the addition of the reigning emperor none</a>
<a id='line_123'>      remain of Gregory VII. or Urban II.; but in those of Paschal II.</a>
<a id='line_124'>      he seems to have renounced this badge of dependence.]</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>      Of her two sovereigns, the emperor had precariously reigned by</a>
<a id='line_127'>      the right of conquest; but the authority of the pope was founded</a>
<a id='line_128'>      on the soft, though more solid, basis of opinion and habit. The</a>
<a id='line_129'>      removal of a foreign influence restored and endeared the shepherd</a>
<a id='line_130'>      to his flock. Instead of the arbitrary or venal nomination of a</a>
<a id='line_131'>      German court, the vicar of Christ was freely chosen by the</a>
<a id='line_132'>      college of cardinals, most of whom were either natives or</a>
<a id='line_133'>      inhabitants of the city. The applause of the magistrates and</a>
<a id='line_134'>      people confirmed his election, and the ecclesiastical power that</a>
<a id='line_135'>      was obeyed in Sweden and Britain had been ultimately derived from</a>
<a id='line_136'>      the suffrage of the Romans. The same suffrage gave a prince, as</a>
<a id='line_137'>      well as a pontiff, to the capital. It was universally believed,</a>
<a id='line_138'>      that Constantine had invested the popes with the temporal</a>
<a id='line_139'>      dominion of Rome; and the boldest civilians, the most profane</a>
<a id='line_140'>      skeptics, were satisfied with disputing the right of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_141'>      and the validity of his gift. The truth of the fact, the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      authenticity of his donation, was deeply rooted in the ignorance</a>
<a id='line_143'>      and tradition of four centuries; and the fabulous origin was lost</a>
<a id='line_144'>      in the real and permanent effects. The name of _Dominus_ or Lord</a>
<a id='line_145'>      was inscribed on the coin of the bishops: their title was</a>
<a id='line_146'>      acknowledged by acclamations and oaths of allegiance, and with</a>
<a id='line_147'>      the free, or reluctant, consent of the German Cæsars, they had</a>
<a id='line_148'>      long exercised a supreme or subordinate jurisdiction over the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      city and patrimony of St. Peter. The reign of the popes, which</a>
<a id='line_150'>      gratified the prejudices, was not incompatible with the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      liberties, of Rome; and a more critical inquiry would have</a>
<a id='line_152'>      revealed a still nobler source of their power; the gratitude of a</a>
<a id='line_153'>      nation, whom they had rescued from the heresy and oppression of</a>
<a id='line_154'>      the Greek tyrant. In an age of superstition, it should seem that</a>
<a id='line_155'>      the union of the royal and sacerdotal characters would mutually</a>
<a id='line_156'>      fortify each other; and that the keys of Paradise would be the</a>
<a id='line_157'>      surest pledge of earthly obedience. The sanctity of the office</a>
<a id='line_158'>      might indeed be degraded by the personal vices of the man. But</a>
<a id='line_159'>      the scandals of the tenth century were obliterated by the austere</a>
<a id='line_160'>      and more dangerous virtues of Gregory the Seventh and his</a>
<a id='line_161'>      successors; and in the ambitious contests which they maintained</a>
<a id='line_162'>      for the rights of the church, their sufferings or their success</a>
<a id='line_163'>      must equally tend to increase the popular veneration. They</a>
<a id='line_164'>      sometimes wandered in poverty and exile, the victims of</a>
<a id='line_165'>      persecution; and the apostolic zeal with which they offered</a>
<a id='line_166'>      themselves to martyrdom must engage the favor and sympathy of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      every Catholic breast. And sometimes, thundering from the</a>
<a id='line_168'>      Vatican, they created, judged, and deposed the kings of the</a>
<a id='line_169'>      world; nor could the proudest Roman be disgraced by submitting to</a>
<a id='line_170'>      a priest, whose feet were kissed, and whose stirrup was held, by</a>
<a id='line_171'>      the successors of Charlemagne. 6 Even the temporal interest of</a>
<a id='line_172'>      the city should have protected in peace and honor the residence</a>
<a id='line_173'>      of the popes; from whence a vain and lazy people derived the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      greatest part of their subsistence and riches. The fixed revenue</a>
<a id='line_175'>      of the popes was probably impaired; many of the old patrimonial</a>
<a id='line_176'>      estates, both in Italy and the provinces, had been invaded by</a>
<a id='line_177'>      sacrilegious hands; nor could the loss be compensated by the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      claim, rather than the possession, of the more ample gifts of</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Pepin and his descendants. But the Vatican and Capitol were</a>
<a id='line_180'>      nourished by the incessant and increasing swarms of pilgrims and</a>
<a id='line_181'>      suppliants: the pale of Christianity was enlarged, and the pope</a>
<a id='line_182'>      and cardinals were overwhelmed by the judgment of ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_183'>      and secular causes. A new jurisprudence had established in the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Latin church the right and practice of appeals; 7 and from the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      North and West the bishops and abbots were invited or summoned to</a>
<a id='line_186'>      solicit, to complain, to accuse, or to justify, before the</a>
<a id='line_187'>      threshold of the apostles. A rare prodigy is once recorded, that</a>
<a id='line_188'>      two horses, belonging to the archbishops of Mentz and Cologne,</a>
<a id='line_189'>      repassed the Alps, yet laden with gold and silver: 8 but it was</a>
<a id='line_190'>      soon understood, that the success, both of the pilgrims and</a>
<a id='line_191'>      clients, depended much less on the justice of their cause than on</a>
<a id='line_192'>      the value of their offering. The wealth and piety of these</a>
<a id='line_193'>      strangers were ostentatiously displayed; and their expenses,</a>
<a id='line_194'>      sacred or profane, circulated in various channels for the</a>
<a id='line_195'>      emolument of the Romans.</a>

<a id='line_226'>      secure possession of the most important blessings. And it was</a>
<a id='line_227'>      thus, that the shrine of St. Peter was profaned by the</a>
<a id='line_228'>      thoughtless Romans; who pillaged the offerings, and wounded the</a>
<a id='line_229'>      pilgrims, without computing the number and value of similar</a>
<a id='line_230'>      visits, which they prevented by their inhospitable sacrilege.</a>

<a id='line_235'>      Barbarian; yet such a mind is the least capable of preferring</a>
<a id='line_236'>      imagination to sense, of sacrificing to a distant motive, to an</a>
<a id='line_237'>      invisible, perhaps an ideal, object, the appetites and interests</a>
<a id='line_238'>      of the present world. In the vigor of health and youth, his</a>
<a id='line_239'>      practice will perpetually contradict his belief; till the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      pressure of age, or sickness, or calamity, awakens his terrors,</a>
<a id='line_241'>      and compels him to satisfy the double debt of piety and remorse.</a>
<a id='line_242'>      I have already observed, that the modern times of religious</a>
<a id='line_243'>      indifference are the most favorable to the peace and security of</a>
<a id='line_244'>      the clergy. Under the reign of superstition, they had much to</a>
<a id='line_245'>      hope from the ignorance, and much to fear from the violence, of</a>
<a id='line_246'>      mankind. The wealth, whose constant increase must have rendered</a>
<a id='line_247'>      them the sole proprietors of the earth, was alternately bestowed</a>
<a id='line_248'>      by the repentant father and plundered by the rapacious son: their</a>

<a id='line_319'>      twelfth century, which represent the state of the popes and the</a>
<a id='line_320'>      city. On Holy Thursday, while Paschal officiated before the</a>
<a id='line_321'>      altar, he was interrupted by the clamors of the multitude, who</a>
<a id='line_322'>      imperiously demanded the confirmation of a favorite magistrate.</a>
<a id='line_323'>      His silence exasperated their fury; his pious refusal to mingle</a>
<a id='line_324'>      the affairs of earth and heaven was encountered with menaces, and</a>
<a id='line_325'>      oaths, that he should be the cause and the witness of the public</a>
<a id='line_326'>      ruin. During the festival of Easter, while the bishop and the</a>
<a id='line_327'>      clergy, barefooted and in procession, visited the tombs of the</a>
<a id='line_328'>      martyrs, they were twice assaulted, at the bridge of St. Angelo,</a>
<a id='line_329'>      and before the Capitol, with volleys of stones and darts. The</a>
<a id='line_330'>      houses of his adherents were levelled with the ground: Paschal</a>
<a id='line_331'>      escaped with difficulty and danger; he levied an army in the</a>
<a id='line_332'>      patrimony of St. Peter; and his last days were embittered by</a>
<a id='line_333'>      suffering and inflicting the calamities of civil war. The scenes</a>
<a id='line_334'>      that followed the election of his successor Gelasius the Second</a>
<a id='line_335'>      were still more scandalous to the church and city. Cencio</a>
<a id='line_336'>      Frangipani, 14 a potent and factious baron, burst into the</a>
<a id='line_337'>      assembly furious and in arms: the cardinals were stripped,</a>
<a id='line_338'>      beaten, and trampled under foot; and he seized, without pity or</a>
<a id='line_339'>      respect, the vicar of Christ by the throat. Gelasius was dragged</a>
<a id='line_340'>      by the hair along the ground, buffeted with blows, wounded with</a>
<a id='line_341'>      spurs, and bound with an iron chain in the house of his brutal</a>
<a id='line_342'>      tyrant. An insurrection of the people delivered their bishop: the</a>
<a id='line_343'>      rival families opposed the violence of the Frangipani; and</a>
<a id='line_344'>      Cencio, who sued for pardon, repented of the failure, rather than</a>
<a id='line_345'>      of the guilt, of his enterprise. Not many days had elapsed, when</a>
<a id='line_346'>      the pope was again assaulted at the altar. While his friends and</a>
<a id='line_347'>      enemies were engaged in a bloody contest, he escaped in his</a>
<a id='line_348'>      sacerdotal garments. In this unworthy flight, which excited the</a>
<a id='line_349'>      compassion of the Roman matrons, his attendants were scattered or</a>
<a id='line_350'>      unhorsed; and, in the fields behind the church of St. Peter, his</a>
<a id='line_351'>      successor was found alone and half dead with fear and fatigue.</a>
<a id='line_352'>      Shaking the dust from his feet, the _apostle_ withdrew from a</a>
<a id='line_353'>      city in which his dignity was insulted and his person was</a>
<a id='line_354'>      endangered; and the vanity of sacerdotal ambition is revealed in</a>
<a id='line_355'>      the involuntary confession, that one emperor was more tolerable</a>
<a id='line_356'>      than twenty. 15 These examples might suffice; but I cannot forget</a>
<a id='line_357'>      the sufferings of two pontiffs of the same age, the second and</a>
<a id='line_358'>      third of the name of Lucius. The former, as he ascended in battle</a>
<a id='line_359'>      array to assault the Capitol, was struck on the temple by a</a>
<a id='line_360'>      stone, and expired in a few days. The latter was severely wounded</a>
<a id='line_361'>      in the person of his servants. In a civil commotion, several of</a>
<a id='line_362'>      his priests had been made prisoners; and the inhuman Romans,</a>
<a id='line_363'>      reserving one as a guide for his brethren, put out their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_364'>      crowned them with ludicrous mitres, mounted them on asses with</a>
<a id='line_365'>      their faces towards the tail, and extorted an oath, that, in this</a>
<a id='line_366'>      wretched condition, they should offer themselves as a lesson to</a>
<a id='line_367'>      the head of the church. Hope or fear, lassitude or remorse, the</a>
<a id='line_368'>      characters of the men, and the circumstances of the times, might</a>
<a id='line_369'>      sometimes obtain an interval of peace and obedience; and the pope</a>
<a id='line_370'>      was restored with joyful acclamations to the Lateran or Vatican,</a>
<a id='line_371'>      from whence he had been driven with threats and violence. But the</a>
<a id='line_372'>      root of mischief was deep and perennial; and a momentary calm was</a>
<a id='line_373'>      preceded and followed by such tempests as had almost sunk the</a>
<a id='line_374'>      bark of St. Peter. Rome continually presented the aspect of war</a>
<a id='line_375'>      and discord: the churches and palaces were fortified and</a>
<a id='line_376'>      assaulted by the factions and families; and, after giving peace</a>
<a id='line_377'>      to Europe, Calistus the Second alone had resolution and power to</a>
<a id='line_378'>      prohibit the use of private arms in the metropolis. Among the</a>
<a id='line_379'>      nations who revered the apostolic throne, the tumults of Rome</a>
<a id='line_380'>      provoked a general indignation; and in a letter to his disciple</a>
<a id='line_381'>      Eugenius the Third, St. Bernard, with the sharpness of his wit</a>
<a id='line_382'>      and zeal, has stigmatized the vices of the rebellious people. 16</a>

<a id='line_461'>      conscience, the desire of freedom with the profession of piety.</a>
<a id='line_462'>      19 The trumpet of Roman liberty was first sounded by Arnold of</a>
<a id='line_463'>      Brescia, 20 whose promotion in the church was confined to the</a>
<a id='line_464'>      lowest rank, and who wore the monastic habit rather as a garb of</a>
<a id='line_465'>      poverty than as a uniform of obedience. His adversaries could not</a>
<a id='line_466'>      deny the wit and eloquence which they severely felt; they confess</a>
<a id='line_467'>      with reluctance the specious purity of his morals; and his errors</a>
<a id='line_468'>      were recommended to the public by a mixture of important and</a>
<a id='line_469'>      beneficial truths. In his theological studies, he had been the</a>
<a id='line_470'>      disciple of the famous and unfortunate Abelard, 21 who was</a>
<a id='line_471'>      likewise involved in the suspicion of heresy: but the lover of</a>
<a id='line_472'>      Eloisa was of a soft and flexible nature; and his ecclesiastic</a>
<a id='line_473'>      judges were edified and disarmed by the humility of his</a>
<a id='line_474'>      repentance. From this master, Arnold most probably imbibed some</a>
<a id='line_475'>      metaphysical definitions of the Trinity, repugnant to the taste</a>
<a id='line_476'>      of the times: his ideas of baptism and the eucharist are loosely</a>
<a id='line_477'>      censured; but a political heresy was the source of his fame and</a>
<a id='line_478'>      misfortunes. He presumed to quote the declaration of Christ, that</a>
<a id='line_479'>      his kingdom is not of this world: he boldly maintained, that the</a>
<a id='line_480'>      sword and the sceptre were intrusted to the civil magistrate;</a>
<a id='line_481'>      that temporal honors and possessions were lawfully vested in</a>
<a id='line_482'>      secular persons; that the abbots, the bishops, and the pope</a>
<a id='line_483'>      himself, must renounce either their state or their salvation; and</a>
<a id='line_484'>      that after the loss of their revenues, the voluntary tithes and</a>
<a id='line_485'>      oblations of the faithful would suffice, not indeed for luxury</a>
<a id='line_486'>      and avarice, but for a frugal life in the exercise of spiritual</a>
<a id='line_487'>      labors. During a short time, the preacher was revered as a</a>
<a id='line_488'>      patriot; and the discontent, or revolt, of Brescia against her</a>
<a id='line_489'>      bishop, was the first fruits of his dangerous lessons. But the</a>
<a id='line_490'>      favor of the people is less permanent than the resentment of the</a>
<a id='line_491'>      priest; and after the heresy of Arnold had been condemned by</a>
<a id='line_492'>      Innocent the Second, 22 in the general council of the Lateran,</a>
<a id='line_493'>      the magistrates themselves were urged by prejudice and fear to</a>
<a id='line_494'>      execute the sentence of the church. Italy could no longer afford</a>
<a id='line_495'>      a refuge; and the disciple of Abelard escaped beyond the Alps,</a>
<a id='line_496'>      till he found a safe and hospitable shelter in Zurich, now the</a>

<a id='line_574'>      patience and the vices of the clergy had degenerated from the</a>
<a id='line_575'>      primitive times of the church and the city. He exhorted them to</a>
<a id='line_576'>      assert the inalienable rights of men and Christians; to restore</a>
<a id='line_577'>      the laws and magistrates of the republic; to respect the _name_</a>
<a id='line_578'>      of the emperor; but to confine their shepherd to the spiritual</a>

<a id='line_588'>      ten years, while two popes, Innocent the Second and Anastasius</a>
<a id='line_589'>      the Fourth, either trembled in the Vatican, or wandered as exiles</a>
<a id='line_590'>      in the adjacent cities. They were succeeded by a more vigorous</a>
<a id='line_591'>      and fortunate pontiff. Adrian the Fourth, 28 the only Englishman</a>
<a id='line_592'>      who has ascended the throne of St. Peter; and whose merit emerged</a>
<a id='line_593'>      from the mean condition of a monk, and almost a beggar, in the</a>
<a id='line_594'>      monastery of St. Albans. On the first provocation, of a cardinal</a>
<a id='line_595'>      killed or wounded in the streets, he cast an interdict on the</a>
<a id='line_596'>      guilty people; and from Christmas to Easter, Rome was deprived of</a>
<a id='line_597'>      the real or imaginary comforts of religious worship. The Romans</a>
<a id='line_598'>      had despised their temporal prince: they submitted with grief and</a>
<a id='line_599'>      terror to the censures of their spiritual father: their guilt was</a>
<a id='line_600'>      expiated by penance, and the banishment of the seditious preacher</a>
<a id='line_601'>      was the price of their absolution. But the revenge of Adrian was</a>
<a id='line_602'>      yet unsatisfied, and the approaching coronation of Frederic</a>
<a id='line_603'>      Barbarossa was fatal to the bold reformer, who had offended,</a>
<a id='line_604'>      though not in an equal degree, the heads of the church and state.</a>
<a id='line_605'>      In their interview at Viterbo, the pope represented to the</a>
<a id='line_606'>      emperor the furious, ungovernable spirit of the Romans; the</a>
<a id='line_607'>      insults, the injuries, the fears, to which his person and his</a>
<a id='line_608'>      clergy were continually exposed; and the pernicious tendency of</a>
<a id='line_609'>      the heresy of Arnold, which must subvert the principles of civil,</a>
<a id='line_610'>      as well as ecclesiastical, subordination. Frederic was convinced</a>
<a id='line_611'>      by these arguments, or tempted by the desire of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_612'>      crown: in the balance of ambition, the innocence or life of an</a>
<a id='line_613'>      individual is of small account; and their common enemy was</a>
<a id='line_614'>      sacrificed to a moment of political concord. After his retreat</a>
<a id='line_615'>      from Rome, Arnold had been protected by the viscounts of</a>
<a id='line_616'>      Campania, from whom he was extorted by the power of Cæsar: the</a>
<a id='line_617'>      præfect of the city pronounced his sentence: the martyr of</a>
<a id='line_618'>      freedom was burned alive in the presence of a careless and</a>
<a id='line_619'>      ungrateful people; and his ashes were cast into the Tyber, lest</a>
<a id='line_620'>      the heretics should collect and worship the relics of their</a>
<a id='line_621'>      master. 29 The clergy triumphed in his death: with his ashes, his</a>
<a id='line_622'>      sect was dispersed; his memory still lived in the minds of the</a>
<a id='line_623'>      Romans. From his school they had probably derived a new article</a>
<a id='line_624'>      of faith, that the metropolis of the Catholic church is exempt</a>
<a id='line_625'>      from the penalties of excommunication and interdict. Their</a>

<a id='line_673'>      to restore, the harmony and proportions of the ancient model. The</a>
<a id='line_674'>      assembly of a free, of an armed, people, will ever speak in loud</a>

<a id='line_677'>      the centuries, the debates of the adverse orators, and the slow</a>

<a id='line_679'>      blind multitude, ignorant of the arts, and insensible of the</a>
<a id='line_680'>      benefits, of legal government. It was proposed by Arnold to</a>
<a id='line_681'>      revive and discriminate the equestrian order; but what could be</a>
<a id='line_682'>      the motive or measure of such distinction? 34 The pecuniary</a>
<a id='line_683'>      qualification of the knights must have been reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      poverty of the times: those times no longer required their civil</a>
<a id='line_685'>      functions of judges and farmers of the revenue; and their</a>
<a id='line_686'>      primitive duty, their military service on horseback, was more</a>
<a id='line_687'>      nobly supplied by feudal tenures and the spirit of chivalry. The</a>

<a id='line_754'>      no more than words.]</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>      In the revolution of the twelfth century, which gave a new</a>
<a id='line_757'>      existence and æra to Rome, we may observe the real and important</a>
<a id='line_758'>      events that marked or confirmed her political independence. I.</a>
<a id='line_759'>      The Capitoline hill, one of her seven eminences, 36 is about four</a>
<a id='line_760'>      hundred yards in length, and two hundred in breadth. A flight of</a>
<a id='line_761'>      a hundred steps led to the summit of the Tarpeian rock; and far</a>
<a id='line_762'>      steeper was the ascent before the declivities had been smoothed</a>
<a id='line_763'>      and the precipices filled by the ruins of fallen edifices. From</a>
<a id='line_764'>      the earliest ages, the Capitol had been used as a temple in</a>
<a id='line_765'>      peace, a fortress in war: after the loss of the city, it</a>
<a id='line_766'>      maintained a siege against the victorious Gauls, and the</a>
<a id='line_767'>      sanctuary of the empire was occupied, assaulted, and burnt, in</a>
<a id='line_768'>      the civil wars of Vitellius and Vespasian. 37 The temples of</a>
<a id='line_769'>      Jupiter and his kindred deities had crumbled into dust; their</a>
<a id='line_770'>      place was supplied by monasteries and houses; and the solid</a>
<a id='line_771'>      walls, the long and shelving porticos, were decayed or ruined by</a>
<a id='line_772'>      the lapse of time. It was the first act of the Romans, an act of</a>
<a id='line_773'>      freedom, to restore the strength, though not the beauty, of the</a>
<a id='line_774'>      Capitol; to fortify the seat of their arms and counsels; and as</a>
<a id='line_775'>      often as they ascended the hill, the coldest minds must have</a>
<a id='line_776'>      glowed with the remembrance of their ancestors. II. The first</a>
<a id='line_777'>      Cæsars had been invested with the exclusive coinage of the gold</a>
<a id='line_778'>      and silver; to the senate they abandoned the baser metal of</a>
<a id='line_779'>      bronze or copper: 38 the emblems and legends were inscribed on a</a>
<a id='line_780'>      more ample field by the genius of flattery; and the prince was</a>
<a id='line_781'>      relieved from the care of celebrating his own virtues. The</a>
<a id='line_782'>      successors of Diocletian despised even the flattery of the</a>
<a id='line_783'>      senate: their royal officers at Rome, and in the provinces,</a>
<a id='line_784'>      assumed the sole direction of the mint; and the same prerogative</a>
<a id='line_785'>      was inherited by the Gothic kings of Italy, and the long series</a>
<a id='line_786'>      of the Greek, the French, and the German dynasties. After an</a>
<a id='line_787'>      abdication of eight hundred years, the Roman senate asserted this</a>
<a id='line_788'>      honorable and lucrative privilege; which was tacitly renounced by</a>
<a id='line_789'>      the popes, from Paschal the Second to the establishment of their</a>
<a id='line_790'>      residence beyond the Alps. Some of these republican coins of the</a>
<a id='line_791'>      twelfth and thirteenth centuries are shown in the cabinets of the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      curious. On one of these, a gold medal, Christ is depictured</a>
<a id='line_793'>      holding in his left hand a book with this inscription: “The vow</a>
<a id='line_794'>      of the Roman senate and people: Rome the capital of the world;”</a>
<a id='line_795'>      on the reverse, St. Peter delivering a banner to a kneeling</a>
<a id='line_796'>      senator in his cap and gown, with the name and arms of his family</a>
<a id='line_797'>      impressed on a shield. 39 III. With the empire, the præfect of</a>
<a id='line_798'>      the city had declined to a municipal officer; yet he still</a>
<a id='line_799'>      exercised in the last appeal the civil and criminal jurisdiction;</a>
<a id='line_800'>      and a drawn sword, which he received from the successors of Otho,</a>
<a id='line_801'>      was the mode of his investiture and the emblem of his functions.</a>
<a id='line_802'>      40 The dignity was confined to the noble families of Rome: the</a>
<a id='line_803'>      choice of the people was ratified by the pope; but a triple oath</a>
<a id='line_804'>      of fidelity must have often embarrassed the præfect in the</a>
<a id='line_805'>      conflict of adverse duties. 41 A servant, in whom they possessed</a>
<a id='line_806'>      but a third share, was dismissed by the independent Romans: in</a>
<a id='line_807'>      his place they elected a patrician; but this title, which</a>
<a id='line_808'>      Charlemagne had not disdained, was too lofty for a citizen or a</a>
<a id='line_809'>      subject; and, after the first fervor of rebellion, they consented</a>
<a id='line_810'>      without reluctance to the restoration of the præfect. About fifty</a>
<a id='line_811'>      years after this event, Innocent the Third, the most ambitious,</a>
<a id='line_812'>      or at least the most fortunate, of the Pontiffs, delivered the</a>
<a id='line_813'>      Romans and himself from this badge of foreign dominion: he</a>
<a id='line_814'>      invested the præfect with a banner instead of a sword, and</a>
<a id='line_815'>      absolved him from all dependence of oaths or service to the</a>
<a id='line_816'>      German emperors. 42 In his place an ecclesiastic, a present or</a>
<a id='line_817'>      future cardinal, was named by the pope to the civil government of</a>
<a id='line_818'>      Rome; but his jurisdiction has been reduced to a narrow compass;</a>
<a id='line_819'>      and in the days of freedom, the right or exercise was derived</a>
<a id='line_820'>      from the senate and people. IV. After the revival of the senate,</a>
<a id='line_821'>      43 the conscript fathers (if I may use the expression) were</a>
<a id='line_822'>      invested with the legislative and executive power; but their</a>
<a id='line_823'>      views seldom reached beyond the present day; and that day was</a>
<a id='line_824'>      most frequently disturbed by violence and tumult. In its utmost</a>
<a id='line_825'>      plenitude, the order or assembly consisted of fifty-six senators,</a>
<a id='line_826'>      44 the most eminent of whom were distinguished by the title of</a>
<a id='line_827'>      counsellors: they were nominated, perhaps annually, by the</a>
<a id='line_828'>      people; and a previous choice of their electors, ten persons in</a>
<a id='line_829'>      each region, or parish, might afford a basis for a free and</a>
<a id='line_830'>      permanent constitution. The popes, who in this tempest submitted</a>
<a id='line_831'>      rather to bend than to break, confirmed by treaty the</a>
<a id='line_832'>      establishment and privileges of the senate, and expected from</a>
<a id='line_833'>      time, peace, and religion, the restoration of their government.</a>
<a id='line_834'>      The motives of public and private interest might sometimes draw</a>
<a id='line_835'>      from the Romans an occasional and temporary sacrifice of their</a>
<a id='line_836'>      claims; and they renewed their oath of allegiance to the</a>

<a id='line_913'>      The union and vigor of a public council was dissolved in a</a>

<a id='line_916'>      authority of the senate in a single magistrate, or two</a>
<a id='line_917'>      colleagues; and as they were changed at the end of a year, or of</a>
<a id='line_918'>      six months, the greatness of the trust was compensated by the</a>
<a id='line_919'>      shortness of the term. But in this transient reign, the senators</a>
<a id='line_920'>      of Rome indulged their avarice and ambition: their justice was</a>
<a id='line_921'>      perverted by the interest of their family and faction; and as</a>
<a id='line_922'>      they punished only their enemies, they were obeyed only by their</a>
<a id='line_923'>      adherents. Anarchy, no longer tempered by the pastoral care of</a>

<a id='line_926'>      which they were hopeless of finding at home. In the same age, and</a>
<a id='line_927'>      from the same motives, most of the Italian republics were</a>

<a id='line_968'>      It was thus, about the middle of the thirteenth century, that the</a>
<a id='line_969'>      Romans called from Bologna the senator Brancaleone, 48 whose fame</a>
<a id='line_970'>      and merit have been rescued from oblivion by the pen of an</a>
<a id='line_971'>      English historian. A just anxiety for his reputation, a clear</a>
<a id='line_972'>      foresight of the difficulties of the task, had engaged him to</a>
<a id='line_973'>      refuse the honor of their choice: the statutes of Rome were</a>
<a id='line_974'>      suspended, and his office prolonged to the term of three years.</a>
<a id='line_975'>      By the guilty and licentious he was accused as cruel; by the</a>
<a id='line_976'>      clergy he was suspected as partial; but the friends of peace and</a>
<a id='line_977'>      order applauded the firm and upright magistrate by whom those</a>
<a id='line_978'>      blessings were restored. No criminals were so powerful as to</a>
<a id='line_979'>      brave, so obscure as to elude, the justice of the senator. By his</a>
<a id='line_980'>      sentence two nobles of the Annibaldi family were executed on a</a>
<a id='line_981'>      gibbet; and he inexorably demolished, in the city and</a>
<a id='line_982'>      neighborhood, one hundred and forty towers, the strong shelters</a>
<a id='line_983'>      of rapine and mischief. The bishop, as a simple bishop, was</a>
<a id='line_984'>      compelled to reside in his diocese; and the standard of</a>
<a id='line_985'>      Brancaleone was displayed in the field with terror and effect.</a>
<a id='line_986'>      His services were repaid by the ingratitude of a people unworthy</a>
<a id='line_987'>      of the happiness which they enjoyed. By the public robbers, whom</a>
<a id='line_988'>      he had provoked for their sake, the Romans were excited to depose</a>
<a id='line_989'>      and imprison their benefactor; nor would his life have been</a>
<a id='line_990'>      spared, if Bologna had not possessed a pledge for his safety.</a>
<a id='line_991'>      Before his departure, the prudent senator had required the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      exchange of thirty hostages of the noblest families of Rome: on</a>
<a id='line_993'>      the news of his danger, and at the prayer of his wife, they were</a>
<a id='line_994'>      more strictly guarded; and Bologna, in the cause of honor,</a>

<a id='line_1255'>      fanciful historian 62 amused the Romans with the picture of their</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      ancient wars. “There was a time,” says Florus, “when Tibur and</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      Præneste, our summer retreats, were the objects of hostile vows</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      in the Capitol, when we dreaded the shades of the Arician groves,</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      when we could triumph without a blush over the nameless villages</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      of the Sabines and Latins, and even Corioli could afford a title</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      not unworthy of a victorious general.” The pride of his</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      contemporaries was gratified by the contrast of the past and the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      present: they would have been humbled by the prospect of</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      futurity; by the prediction, that after a thousand years, Rome,</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      despoiled of empire, and contracted to her primæval limits, would</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      renew the same hostilities, on the same ground which was then</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      decorated with her villas and gardens. The adjacent territory on</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      either side of the Tyber was always claimed, and sometimes</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      possessed, as the patrimony of St. Peter; but the barons assumed</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      a lawless independence, and the cities too faithfully copied the</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      revolt and discord of the metropolis. In the twelfth and</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      thirteenth centuries the Romans incessantly labored to reduce or</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      destroy the contumacious vassals of the church and senate; and if</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      their headstrong and selfish ambition was moderated by the pope,</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      he often encouraged their zeal by the alliance of his spiritual</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      arms. Their warfare was that of the first consuls and dictators,</a>

<a id='line_1280'>      returned home after an expedition of fifteen or twenty days.</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      Their sieges were tedious and unskilful: in the use of victory,</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      they indulged the meaner passions of jealousy and revenge; and</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      instead of adopting the valor, they trampled on the misfortunes,</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      of their adversaries. The captives, in their shirts, with a rope</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      round their necks, solicited their pardon: the fortifications,</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      and even the buildings, of the rival cities, were demolished, and</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      the inhabitants were scattered in the adjacent villages. It was</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      thus that the seats of the cardinal bishops, Porto, Ostia,</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      Albanum, Tusculum, Præneste, and Tibur or Tivoli, were</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      successively overthrown by the ferocious hostility of the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      63 Of these, 64 Porto and Ostia, the two keys of the Tyber, are</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      still vacant and desolate: the marshy and unwholesome banks are</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      peopled with herds of buffaloes, and the river is lost to every</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      purpose of navigation and trade. The hills, which afford a shady</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      retirement from the autumnal heats, have again smiled with the</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      blessings of peace; Frescati has arisen near the ruins of</a>

<a id='line_1298'>      and the meaner towns of Albano and Palestrina are decorated with</a>

<a id='line_1300'>      destruction, the ambition of the Romans was often checked and</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      repulsed by the neighboring cities and their allies: in the first</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      siege of Tibur, they were driven from their camp; and the battles</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      of Tusculum 66 and Viterbo 67 might be compared in their relative</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      state to the memorable fields of Thrasymene and Cannæ. In the</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      first of these petty wars, thirty thousand Romans were overthrown</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      by a thousand German horse, whom Frederic Barbarossa had detached</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      to the relief of Tusculum: and if we number the slain at three,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      the prisoners at two, thousand, we shall embrace the most</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      authentic and moderate account. Sixty-eight years afterwards they</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      marched against Viterbo in the ecclesiastical state with the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      whole force of the city; by a rare coalition the Teutonic eagle</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      was blended, in the adverse banners, with the keys of St. Peter;</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      and the pope’s auxiliaries were commanded by a count of Thoulouse</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      and a bishop of Winchester. The Romans were discomfited with</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      shame and slaughter: but the English prelate must have indulged</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      the vanity of a pilgrim, if he multiplied their numbers to one</a>

<a id='line_1365'>      popular election: the sanctuaries of Rome were polluted with</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      blood; and, from the third to the twelfth century, the church was</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      distracted by the mischief of frequent schisms. As long as the</a>

<a id='line_1377'>      freedom of choice was overruled by the tumults of a city that no</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      longer owned or obeyed a superior. On the decease of a pope, two</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      factions proceeded in different churches to a double election:</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      the number and weight of votes, the priority of time, the merit</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      of the candidates, might balance each other: the most respectable</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      of the clergy were divided; and the distant princes, who bowed</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      before the spiritual throne, could not distinguish the spurious,</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      from the legitimate, idol. The emperors were often the authors of</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      the schism, from the political motive of opposing a friendly to a</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      hostile pontiff; and each of the competitors was reduced to</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      suffer the insults of his enemies, who were not awed by</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      conscience, and to purchase the support of his adherents, who</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      were instigated by avarice or ambition a peaceful and perpetual</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      succession was ascertained by Alexander the Third, 68 who finally</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      abolished the tumultuary votes of the clergy and people, and</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      defined the right of election in the sole college of cardinals.</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      69 The three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons, were</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      assimilated to each other by this important privilege; the</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      parochial clergy of Rome obtained the first rank in the</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      hierarchy: they were indifferently chosen among the nations of</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      Christendom; and the possession of the richest benefices, of the</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      most important bishoprics, was not incompatible with their title</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      and office. The senators of the Catholic church, the coadjutors</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      and legates of the supreme pontiff, were robed in purple, the</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      symbol of martyrdom or royalty; they claimed a proud equality</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      with kings; and their dignity was enhanced by the smallness of</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      their number, which, till the reign of Leo the Tenth, seldom</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      exceeded twenty or twenty-five persons. By this wise regulation,</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      all doubt and scandal were removed, and the root of schism was so</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      effectually destroyed, that in a period of six hundred years a</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      double choice has only once divided the unity of the sacred</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      college. But as the concurrence of two thirds of the votes had</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      been made necessary, the election was often delayed by the</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      private interest and passions of the cardinals; and while they</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      prolonged their independent reign, the Christian world was left</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      destitute of a head. A vacancy of almost three years had preceded</a>

<a id='line_1419'>      any separation of walls or curtains: a small window is reserved</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      for the introduction of necessaries; but the door is locked on</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      both sides and guarded by the magistrates of the city, to seclude</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      them from all correspondence with the world. If the election be</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      not consummated in three days, the luxury of their table is</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      contracted to a single dish at dinner and supper; and after the</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      eighth day, they are reduced to a scanty allowance of bread,</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      water, and wine. During the vacancy of the holy see, the</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      cardinals are prohibited from touching the revenues, or assuming,</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      unless in some rare emergency, the government of the church: all</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      agreements and promises among the electors are formally annulled;</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      and their integrity is fortified by their solemn oath and the</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      prayers of the Catholics. Some articles of inconvenient or</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      superfluous rigor have been gradually relaxed, but the principle</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      of confinement is vigorous and entire: they are still urged, by</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      the personal motives of health and freedom, to accelerate the</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      moment of their deliverance; and the improvement of ballot or</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      secret votes has wrapped the struggles of the conclave 71 in the</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      silky veil of charity and politeness. 72 By these institutions</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      the Romans were excluded from the election of their prince and</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      bishop; and in the fever of wild and precarious liberty, they</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      seemed insensible of the loss of this inestimable privilege. The</a>

<a id='line_1722'>      impatience, was soon persuaded by ancient testimony of the</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      justice of their claim; and he proclaimed a plenary absolution to</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      all Catholics who, in the course of that year, and at every</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      similar period, should respectfully visit the apostolic churches</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      of St. Peter and St. Paul. The welcome sound was propagated</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      through Christendom; and at first from the nearest provinces of</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      Italy, and at length from the remote kingdoms of Hungary and</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      Britain, the highways were thronged with a swarm of pilgrims who</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      sought to expiate their sins in a journey, however costly or</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      laborious, which was exempt from the perils of military service.</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      All exceptions of rank or sex, of age or infirmity, were</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      forgotten in the common transport; and in the streets and</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      churches many persons were trampled to death by the eagerness of</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      devotion. The calculation of their numbers could not be easy nor</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      accurate; and they have probably been magnified by a dexterous</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      clergy, well apprised of the contagion of example: yet we are</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      assured by a judicious historian, who assisted at the ceremony,</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      that Rome was never replenished with less than two hundred</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      thousand strangers; and another spectator has fixed at two</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      millions the total concourse of the year. A trifling oblation</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      from each individual would accumulate a royal treasure; and two</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      priests stood night and day, with rakes in their hands, to</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      collect, without counting, the heaps of gold and silver that were</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      poured on the altar of St. Paul. 86 It was fortunately a season</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      of peace and plenty; and if forage was scarce, if inns and</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      lodgings were extravagantly dear, an inexhaustible supply of</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      bread and wine, of meat and fish, was provided by the policy of</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      Boniface and the venal hospitality of the Romans. From a city</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      without trade or industry, all casual riches will speedily</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      evaporate: but the avarice and envy of the next generation</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      solicited Clement the Sixth 87 to anticipate the distant period</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      of the century. The gracious pontiff complied with their wishes;</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      afforded Rome this poor consolation for his loss; and justified</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      the change by the name and practice of the Mosaic Jubilee. 88 His</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      summons was obeyed; and the number, zeal, and liberality of the</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      pilgrims did not yield to the primitive festival. But they</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      encountered the triple scourge of war, pestilence, and famine:</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      many wives and virgins were violated in the castles of Italy; and</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      many strangers were pillaged or murdered by the savage Romans, no</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      longer moderated by the presence of their bishops. 89 To the</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      impatience of the popes we may ascribe the successive reduction</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      to fifty, thirty-three, and twenty-five years; although the</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      second of these terms is commensurate with the life of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      The profusion of indulgences, the revolt of the Protestants, and</a>

<a id='line_1814'>      of Rome was unequal to the task of curbing her rebellious sons,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      who scorned the authority of the magistrate within and without</a>

<a id='line_1818'>      asserted in arms their personal independence; their palaces and</a>

<a id='line_1820'>      quarrels were maintained by the numbers of their vassals and</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      retainers. In origin and affection, they were aliens to their</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      country: 92 and a genuine Roman, could such have been produced,</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      might have renounced these haughty strangers, who disdained the</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      appellation of citizens, and proudly styled themselves the</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      princes, of Rome. 93 After a dark series of revolutions, all</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      records of pedigree were lost; the distinction of surnames was</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      abolished; the blood of the nations was mingled in a thousand</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      channels; and the Goths and Lombards, the Greeks and Franks, the</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      Germans and Normans, had obtained the fairest possessions by</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      royal bounty, or the prerogative of valor. These examples might</a>

<a id='line_1928'>      while it explains the simple meaning, of the name. By the</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      usurpation of Cavæ, the Colonna provoked the arms of Paschal the</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      Second; but they lawfully held in the Campagna of Rome the</a>

<a id='line_1935'>      their descent from the counts of Tusculum, who in the tenth</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      century were the tyrants of the apostolic see. According to their</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      own and the public opinion, the primitive and remote source was</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      derived from the banks of the Rhine; 99 and the sovereigns of</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      Germany were not ashamed of a real or fabulous affinity with a</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      noble race, which in the revolutions of seven hundred years has</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      been often illustrated by merit and always by fortune. 100 About</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      the end of the thirteenth century, the most powerful branch was</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      composed of an uncle and six bothers, all conspicuous in arms, or</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      in the honors of the church. Of these, Peter was elected senator</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      of Rome, introduced to the Capitol in a triumphal car, and hailed</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      in some vain acclamations with the title of Cæsar; while John and</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      Stephen were declared marquis of Ancona and count of Romagna, by</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      Nicholas the Fourth, a patron so partial to their family, that he</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      has been delineated in satirical portraits, imprisoned as it were</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      in a hollow pillar. 101 After his decease their haughty behavior</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      provoked the displeasure of the most implacable of mankind. The</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      two cardinals, the uncle and the nephew, denied the election of</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      Boniface the Eighth; and the Colonna were oppressed for a moment</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      by his temporal and spiritual arms. 102 He proclaimed a crusade</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      against his personal enemies; their estates were confiscated;</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      their fortresses on either side of the Tyber were besieged by the</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      troops of St. Peter and those of the rival nobles; and after the</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      ruin of Palestrina or Præneste, their principal seat, the ground</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      was marked with a ploughshare, the emblem of perpetual</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      desolation. Degraded, banished, proscribed, the six brothers, in</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      disguise and danger, wandered over Europe without renouncing the</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      hope of deliverance and revenge. In this double hope, the French</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      court was their surest asylum; they prompted and directed the</a>

<a id='line_1965'>      they respected the misfortune and courage of the captive tyrant.</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      His civil acts were annulled by the Roman people, who restored</a>

<a id='line_1968'>      be formed of their wealth by their losses, of their losses by the</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      damages of one hundred thousand gold florins which were granted</a>

<a id='line_1971'>      the spiritual censures and disqualifications were abolished 103</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      by his prudent successors; and the fortune of the house was more</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      firmly established by this transient hurricane. The boldness of</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      Sciarra Colonna was signalized in the captivity of Boniface, and</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      long afterwards in the coronation of Lewis of Bavaria; and by the</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      gratitude of the emperor, the pillar in their arms was encircled</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      with a royal crown. But the first of the family in fame and merit</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      was the elder Stephen, whom Petrarch loved and esteemed as a hero</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      superior to his own times, and not unworthy of ancient Rome.</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      Persecution and exile displayed to the nations his abilities in</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      peace and war; in his distress he was an object, not of pity, but</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      of reverence; the aspect of danger provoked him to avow his name</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      and country; and when he was asked, “Where is now your fortress?”</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      he laid his hand on his heart, and answered, “Here.” He supported</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      with the same virtue the return of prosperity; and, till the ruin</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      of his declining age, the ancestors, the character, and the</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      children of Stephen Colonna, exalted his dignity in the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      republic, and at the court of Avignon. II. The Ursini migrated</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      from Spoleto; 104 the sons of Ursus, as they are styled in the</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      twelfth century, from some eminent person, who is only known as</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      the father of their race. But they were soon distinguished among</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      the nobles of Rome, by the number and bravery of their kinsmen,</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      the strength of their towers, the honors of the senate and sacred</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      college, and the elevation of two popes, Celestin the Third and</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      Nicholas the Third, of their name and lineage. 105 Their riches</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      may be accused as an early abuse of nepotism: the estates of St.</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      Peter were alienated in their favor by the liberal Celestin; 106</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      and Nicholas was ambitious for their sake to solicit the alliance</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      of monarchs; to found new kingdoms in Lombardy and Tuscany; and</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      to invest them with the perpetual office of senators of Rome. All</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      that has been observed of the greatness of the Colonna will</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      likewise redound to the glory of the Ursini, their constant and</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      equal antagonists in the long hereditary feud, which distracted</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      above two hundred and fifty years the ecclesiastical state. The</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      jealously of preeminence and power was the true ground of their</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      quarrel; but as a specious badge of distinction, the Colonna</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      embraced the name of Ghibelines and the party of the empire; the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      Ursini espoused the title of Guelphs and the cause of the church.</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      The eagle and the keys were displayed in their adverse banners;</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      and the two factions of Italy most furiously raged when the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      origin and nature of the dispute were long since forgotten. 107</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      After the retreat of the popes to Avignon they disputed in arms</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      the vacant republic; and the mischiefs of discord were</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      perpetuated by the wretched compromise of electing each year two</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      rival senators. By their private hostilities the city and country</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      were desolated, and the fluctuating balance inclined with their</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      alternate success. But none of either family had fallen by the</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      sword, till the most renowned champion of the Ursini was</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      surprised and slain by the younger Stephen Colonna. 108 His</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      triumph is stained with the reproach of violating the truce;</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      their defeat was basely avenged by the assassination, before the</a>
