<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'> Enter Antonio, Salarino and Solanio.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_80'>In sooth I know not why I am so sad,</a>
<a id='line_81'>It wearies me. you say it wearies you;</a>
<a id='line_82'>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</a>
<a id='line_83'>What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</a>
<a id='line_84'>I am to learn.</a>
<a id='line_85'>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</a>
<a id='line_86'>That I have much ado to know myself.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_89'>Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</a>
<a id='line_90'>There where your argosies, with portly sail</a>
<a id='line_91'>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</a>
<a id='line_92'>Or as it were the pageants of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_93'>Do overpeer the petty traffickers</a>
<a id='line_94'>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</a>
<a id='line_95'>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>SOLANIO.</a>
<a id='line_98'>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</a>
<a id='line_99'>The better part of my affections would</a>
<a id='line_100'>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</a>
<a id='line_101'>Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,</a>
<a id='line_102'>Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;</a>
<a id='line_103'>And every object that might make me fear</a>
<a id='line_104'>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</a>
<a id='line_105'>Would make me sad.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_108'>My wind cooling my broth</a>
<a id='line_109'>Would blow me to an ague when I thought</a>
<a id='line_110'>What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</a>
<a id='line_111'>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run</a>
<a id='line_112'>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</a>
<a id='line_113'>And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,</a>
<a id='line_114'>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</a>
<a id='line_115'>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</a>
<a id='line_116'>And see the holy edifice of stone</a>
<a id='line_117'>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</a>
<a id='line_118'>Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</a>
<a id='line_119'>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</a>
<a id='line_120'>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</a>
<a id='line_121'>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</a>
<a id='line_122'>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</a>
<a id='line_123'>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</a>
<a id='line_124'>That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?</a>
<a id='line_125'>But tell not me, I know Antonio</a>
<a id='line_126'>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_129'>Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,</a>
<a id='line_130'>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</a>
<a id='line_131'>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</a>
<a id='line_132'>Upon the fortune of this present year.</a>
<a id='line_133'>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_136'>Why then you are in love.</a>
<a id='line_137'></a>
<a id='line_138'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_139'>Fie, fie!</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_142'>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad</a>
<a id='line_143'>Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy</a>
<a id='line_144'>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry</a>
<a id='line_145'>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</a>
<a id='line_146'>Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:</a>
<a id='line_147'>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_148'>And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.</a>
<a id='line_149'>And other of such vinegar aspect</a>
<a id='line_150'>That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile</a>
<a id='line_151'>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'> Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>SOLANIO.</a>
<a id='line_156'>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</a>
<a id='line_157'>Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.</a>
<a id='line_158'>We leave you now with better company.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_161'>I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,</a>
<a id='line_162'>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_165'>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</a>
<a id='line_166'>I take it your own business calls on you,</a>
<a id='line_167'>And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_170'>Good morrow, my good lords.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_173'>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?</a>
<a id='line_174'>You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>SALARINO.</a>
<a id='line_177'>We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'> [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._]</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>LORENZO.</a>
<a id='line_182'>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</a>
<a id='line_183'>We two will leave you, but at dinner-time</a>
<a id='line_184'>I pray you have in mind where we must meet.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_187'>I will not fail you.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_190'>You look not well, Signior Antonio,</a>
<a id='line_191'>You have too much respect upon the world.</a>
<a id='line_192'>They lose it that do buy it with much care.</a>
<a id='line_193'>Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_196'>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</a>
<a id='line_197'>A stage, where every man must play a part,</a>
<a id='line_198'>And mine a sad one.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_201'>Let me play the fool,</a>
<a id='line_202'>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</a>
<a id='line_203'>And let my liver rather heat with wine</a>
<a id='line_204'>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</a>
<a id='line_205'>Why should a man whose blood is warm within</a>
<a id='line_206'>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</a>
<a id='line_207'>Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice</a>
<a id='line_208'>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,</a>
<a id='line_209'>(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):</a>
<a id='line_210'>There are a sort of men whose visages</a>
<a id='line_211'>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</a>
<a id='line_212'>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</a>
<a id='line_213'>With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion</a>
<a id='line_214'>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</a>
<a id='line_215'>As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,</a>
<a id='line_216'>And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”</a>
<a id='line_217'>O my Antonio, I do know of these</a>
<a id='line_218'>That therefore only are reputed wise</a>
<a id='line_219'>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</a>
<a id='line_220'>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</a>
<a id='line_221'>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</a>
<a id='line_222'>I’ll tell thee more of this another time.</a>
<a id='line_223'>But fish not with this melancholy bait</a>
<a id='line_224'>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</a>
<a id='line_225'>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.</a>
<a id='line_226'>I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>LORENZO.</a>
<a id='line_229'>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.</a>
<a id='line_230'>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</a>
<a id='line_231'>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_234'>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</a>
<a id='line_235'>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_238'>Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_241'>Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</a>
<a id='line_242'>In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'> [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._]</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_247'>Is that anything now?</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_250'>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all</a>
<a id='line_251'>Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of</a>
<a id='line_252'>chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them</a>
<a id='line_253'>they are not worth the search.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_256'>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</a>
<a id='line_257'>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</a>
<a id='line_258'>That you today promis’d to tell me of?</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_261'>’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</a>
<a id='line_262'>How much I have disabled mine estate</a>
<a id='line_263'>By something showing a more swelling port</a>
<a id='line_264'>Than my faint means would grant continuance.</a>
<a id='line_265'>Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d</a>
<a id='line_266'>From such a noble rate, but my chief care</a>
<a id='line_267'>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</a>
<a id='line_268'>Wherein my time, something too prodigal,</a>
<a id='line_269'>Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,</a>
<a id='line_270'>I owe the most in money and in love,</a>
<a id='line_271'>And from your love I have a warranty</a>
<a id='line_272'>To unburden all my plots and purposes</a>
<a id='line_273'>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_276'>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</a>
<a id='line_277'>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</a>
<a id='line_278'>Within the eye of honour, be assur’d</a>
<a id='line_279'>My purse, my person, my extremest means</a>
<a id='line_280'>Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.</a>
<a id='line_281'></a>
<a id='line_282'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_283'>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</a>
<a id='line_284'>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</a>
<a id='line_285'>The self-same way, with more advised watch</a>
<a id='line_286'>To find the other forth; and by adventuring both</a>
<a id='line_287'>I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof</a>
<a id='line_288'>Because what follows is pure innocence.</a>
<a id='line_289'>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</a>
<a id='line_290'>That which I owe is lost. But if you please</a>
<a id='line_291'>To shoot another arrow that self way</a>
<a id='line_292'>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</a>
<a id='line_293'>As I will watch the aim, or to find both,</a>
<a id='line_294'>Or bring your latter hazard back again,</a>
<a id='line_295'>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_298'>You know me well, and herein spend but time</a>
<a id='line_299'>To wind about my love with circumstance;</a>
<a id='line_300'>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</a>
<a id='line_301'>In making question of my uttermost</a>
<a id='line_302'>Than if you had made waste of all I have.</a>
<a id='line_303'>Then do but say to me what I should do</a>
<a id='line_304'>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</a>
<a id='line_305'>And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_308'>In Belmont is a lady richly left,</a>
<a id='line_309'>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</a>
<a id='line_310'>Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes</a>
<a id='line_311'>I did receive fair speechless messages:</a>
<a id='line_312'>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d</a>
<a id='line_313'>To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.</a>
<a id='line_314'>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</a>
<a id='line_315'>For the four winds blow in from every coast</a>
<a id='line_316'>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</a>
<a id='line_317'>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,</a>
<a id='line_318'>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,</a>
<a id='line_319'>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</a>
<a id='line_320'>O my Antonio, had I but the means</a>
<a id='line_321'>To hold a rival place with one of them,</a>
<a id='line_322'>I have a mind presages me such thrift</a>
<a id='line_323'>That I should questionless be fortunate.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_326'>Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;</a>
<a id='line_327'>Neither have I money nor commodity</a>
<a id='line_328'>To raise a present sum, therefore go forth</a>
<a id='line_329'>Try what my credit can in Venice do;</a>
<a id='line_330'>That shall be rack’d even to the uttermost,</a>
<a id='line_331'>To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.</a>
<a id='line_332'>Go presently inquire, and so will I,</a>
<a id='line_333'>Where money is, and I no question make</a>
<a id='line_334'>To have it of my trust or for my sake.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'> [_Exeunt._]</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'> Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa.</a>
<a id='line_341'></a>
<a id='line_342'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_343'>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.</a>
<a id='line_344'></a>
<a id='line_345'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_346'>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance</a>
<a id='line_347'>as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick</a>
<a id='line_348'>that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no</a>
<a id='line_349'>mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come</a>
<a id='line_350'>sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_353'>Good sentences, and well pronounc’d.</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_356'>They would be better if well followed.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_359'>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been</a>
<a id='line_360'>churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine</a>
<a id='line_361'>that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were</a>
<a id='line_362'>good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own</a>
<a id='line_363'>teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper</a>
<a id='line_364'>leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip</a>
<a id='line_365'>o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not</a>
<a id='line_366'>in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose”! I may</a>
<a id='line_367'>neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of</a>
<a id='line_368'>a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</a>
<a id='line_369'>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_372'>Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good</a>
<a id='line_373'>inspirations. Therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three</a>
<a id='line_374'>chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</a>
<a id='line_375'>chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who</a>
<a id='line_376'>you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection</a>
<a id='line_377'>towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_380'>I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe</a>
<a id='line_381'>them, and according to my description level at my affection.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_384'>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</a>
<a id='line_385'></a>
<a id='line_386'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_387'>Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse,</a>
<a id='line_388'>and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can</a>
<a id='line_389'>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with</a>
<a id='line_390'>a smith.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_393'>Then is there the County Palatine.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_396'>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say “And you will not have me,</a>
<a id='line_397'>choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the</a>
<a id='line_398'>weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly</a>
<a id='line_399'>sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a</a>
<a id='line_400'>bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these</a>
<a id='line_401'>two!</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_404'>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_407'>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it</a>
<a id='line_408'>is a sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the</a>
<a id='line_409'>Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.</a>
<a id='line_410'>He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight</a>
<a id='line_411'>a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I</a>
<a id='line_412'>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive</a>
<a id='line_413'>him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_416'>What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?</a>
<a id='line_417'></a>
<a id='line_418'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_419'>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he</a>
<a id='line_420'>hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the</a>
<a id='line_421'>court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a</a>
<a id='line_422'>proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How</a>
<a id='line_423'>oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</a>
<a id='line_424'>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.</a>
<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_427'>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</a>
<a id='line_428'></a>
<a id='line_429'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_430'>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the</a>
<a id='line_431'>ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was</a>
<a id='line_432'>able. I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for</a>
<a id='line_433'>another.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_436'>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_439'>Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the</a>
<a id='line_440'>afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than</a>
<a id='line_441'>a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the</a>
<a id='line_442'>worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_445'>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should</a>
<a id='line_446'>refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept</a>
<a id='line_447'>him.</a>
<a id='line_448'></a>
<a id='line_449'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_450'>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of</a>
<a id='line_451'>Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and</a>
<a id='line_452'>that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything,</a>
<a id='line_453'>Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_456'>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have</a>
<a id='line_457'>acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to</a>
<a id='line_458'>their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won</a>
<a id='line_459'>by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the</a>
<a id='line_460'>caskets.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_463'>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana,</a>
<a id='line_464'>unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this</a>
<a id='line_465'>parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but</a>
<a id='line_466'>I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_469'>Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar</a>
<a id='line_470'>and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of</a>
<a id='line_471'>Montferrat?</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_474'>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_477'>True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon,</a>
<a id='line_478'>was the best deserving a fair lady.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_481'>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.</a>
<a id='line_482'></a>
<a id='line_483'> Enter a Servingman.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>How now! what news?</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>SERVINGMAN.</a>
<a id='line_488'>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there</a>
<a id='line_489'>is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings</a>
<a id='line_490'>word the Prince his master will be here tonight.</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_493'>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the</a>
<a id='line_494'>other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the</a>
<a id='line_495'>condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he</a>
<a id='line_496'>should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles</a>
<a id='line_497'>we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</a>
<a id='line_498'></a>
<a id='line_499'> [_Exeunt._]</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>SCENE III. Venice. A public place.</a>
<a id='line_502'></a>
<a id='line_503'> Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_506'>Three thousand ducats, well.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_509'>Ay, sir, for three months.</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_512'>For three months, well.</a>
<a id='line_513'></a>
<a id='line_514'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_515'>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_518'>Antonio shall become bound, well.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_521'>May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_524'>Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_527'>Your answer to that.</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_530'>Antonio is a good man.</a>
<a id='line_531'></a>
<a id='line_532'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_533'>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</a>
<a id='line_534'></a>
<a id='line_535'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_536'>Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have</a>
<a id='line_537'>you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in</a>
<a id='line_538'>supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the</a>
<a id='line_539'>Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at</a>
<a id='line_540'>Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered</a>
<a id='line_541'>abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats</a>
<a id='line_542'>and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—I mean pirates—and then</a>
<a id='line_543'>there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is,</a>
<a id='line_544'>notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take</a>
<a id='line_545'>his bond.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_548'>Be assured you may.</a>
<a id='line_549'></a>
<a id='line_550'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_551'>I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me.</a>
<a id='line_552'>May I speak with Antonio?</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_555'>If it please you to dine with us.</a>
<a id='line_556'></a>
<a id='line_557'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_558'>Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the</a>
<a id='line_559'>Nazarite, conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you,</a>
<a id='line_560'>talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with</a>
<a id='line_561'>you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is</a>
<a id='line_562'>he comes here?</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'> Enter Antonio.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_567'>This is Signior Antonio.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_570'>[_Aside._] How like a fawning publican he looks!</a>
<a id='line_571'>I hate him for he is a Christian,</a>
<a id='line_572'>But more for that in low simplicity</a>
<a id='line_573'>He lends out money gratis, and brings down</a>
<a id='line_574'>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</a>
<a id='line_575'>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</a>
<a id='line_576'>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</a>
<a id='line_577'>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,</a>
<a id='line_578'>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</a>
<a id='line_579'>On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,</a>
<a id='line_580'>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe</a>
<a id='line_581'>If I forgive him!</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_584'>Shylock, do you hear?</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_587'>I am debating of my present store,</a>
<a id='line_588'>And by the near guess of my memory</a>
<a id='line_589'>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</a>
<a id='line_590'>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</a>
<a id='line_591'>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</a>
<a id='line_592'>Will furnish me. But soft! how many months</a>
<a id='line_593'>Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior,</a>
<a id='line_594'>Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_597'>Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow</a>
<a id='line_598'>By taking nor by giving of excess,</a>
<a id='line_599'>Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</a>
<a id='line_600'>I’ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess’d</a>
<a id='line_601'>How much ye would?</a>
<a id='line_602'></a>
<a id='line_603'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_604'>Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_607'>And for three months.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_610'>I had forgot, three months, you told me so.</a>
<a id='line_611'>Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,</a>
<a id='line_612'>Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow</a>
<a id='line_613'>Upon advantage.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_616'>I do never use it.</a>
<a id='line_617'></a>
<a id='line_618'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_619'>When Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep,—</a>
<a id='line_620'>This Jacob from our holy Abram was</a>
<a id='line_621'>As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,</a>
<a id='line_622'>The third possessor; ay, he was the third.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_625'>And what of him? Did he take interest?</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_628'>No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</a>
<a id='line_629'>Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.</a>
<a id='line_630'>When Laban and himself were compromis’d</a>
<a id='line_631'>That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied</a>
<a id='line_632'>Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank</a>
<a id='line_633'>In end of autumn turned to the rams,</a>
<a id='line_634'>And when the work of generation was</a>
<a id='line_635'>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</a>
<a id='line_636'>The skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands,</a>
<a id='line_637'>And in the doing of the deed of kind,</a>
<a id='line_638'>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</a>
<a id='line_639'>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</a>
<a id='line_640'>Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s.</a>
<a id='line_641'>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;</a>
<a id='line_642'>And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_645'>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for,</a>
<a id='line_646'>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</a>
<a id='line_647'>But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_648'>Was this inserted to make interest good?</a>
<a id='line_649'>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</a>
<a id='line_650'></a>
<a id='line_651'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_652'>I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.</a>
<a id='line_653'>But note me, signior.</a>
<a id='line_654'></a>
<a id='line_655'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_656'>Mark you this, Bassanio,</a>
<a id='line_657'>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</a>
<a id='line_658'>An evil soul producing holy witness</a>
<a id='line_659'>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</a>
<a id='line_660'>A goodly apple rotten at the heart.</a>
<a id='line_661'>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</a>
<a id='line_662'></a>
<a id='line_663'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_664'>Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum.</a>
<a id='line_665'>Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.</a>
<a id='line_666'></a>
<a id='line_667'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_668'>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_671'>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</a>
<a id='line_672'>In the Rialto you have rated me</a>
<a id='line_673'>About my moneys and my usances.</a>
<a id='line_674'>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,</a>
<a id='line_675'>(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.)</a>
<a id='line_676'>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</a>
<a id='line_677'>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,</a>
<a id='line_678'>And all for use of that which is mine own.</a>
<a id='line_679'>Well then, it now appears you need my help.</a>
<a id='line_680'>Go to, then, you come to me, and you say</a>
<a id='line_681'>“Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so:</a>
<a id='line_682'>You that did void your rheum upon my beard,</a>
<a id='line_683'>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</a>
<a id='line_684'>Over your threshold, moneys is your suit.</a>
<a id='line_685'>What should I say to you? Should I not say</a>
<a id='line_686'>“Hath a dog money? Is it possible</a>
<a id='line_687'>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or</a>
<a id='line_688'>Shall I bend low and, in a bondman’s key,</a>
<a id='line_689'>With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,</a>
<a id='line_690'>Say this:</a>
<a id='line_691'>“Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;</a>
<a id='line_692'>You spurn’d me such a day; another time</a>
<a id='line_693'>You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies</a>
<a id='line_694'>I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?</a>
<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_697'>I am as like to call thee so again,</a>
<a id='line_698'>To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.</a>
<a id='line_699'>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</a>
<a id='line_700'>As to thy friends, for when did friendship take</a>
<a id='line_701'>A breed for barren metal of his friend?</a>
<a id='line_702'>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</a>
<a id='line_703'>Who if he break, thou mayst with better face</a>
<a id='line_704'>Exact the penalty.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_707'>Why, look you how you storm!</a>
<a id='line_708'>I would be friends with you, and have your love,</a>
<a id='line_709'>Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with,</a>
<a id='line_710'>Supply your present wants, and take no doit</a>
<a id='line_711'>Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me,</a>
<a id='line_712'>This is kind I offer.</a>
<a id='line_713'></a>
<a id='line_714'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_715'>This were kindness.</a>
<a id='line_716'></a>
<a id='line_717'>SHYLOCK.</a>
<a id='line_718'>This kindness will I show.</a>
<a id='line_719'>Go with me to a notary, seal me there</a>
<a id='line_720'>Your single bond; and in a merry sport,</a>
<a id='line_721'>If you repay me not on such a day,</a>
<a id='line_722'>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</a>
<a id='line_723'>Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit</a>
<a id='line_724'>Be nominated for an equal pound</a>
<a id='line_725'>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken</a>
<a id='line_726'>In what part of your body pleaseth me.</a>
<a id='line_727'></a>
<a id='line_728'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_729'>Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond,</a>
<a id='line_730'>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</a>

<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>LAUNCELET.</a>
<a id='line_861'>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master.</a>
<a id='line_862'>The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo,</a>
<a id='line_863'>Launcelet Gobbo, good Launcelet” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Launcelet</a>

<a id='line_865'>“No; take heed, honest Launcelet, take heed, honest Gobbo” or, as</a>
<a id='line_866'>aforesaid, “honest Launcelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy</a>

<a id='line_868'>fiend, “away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave</a>
<a id='line_869'>mind,” says the fiend “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the</a>
<a id='line_870'>neck of my heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend Launcelet,</a>
<a id='line_871'>being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed</a>
<a id='line_872'>my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of</a>
<a id='line_873'>taste;—well, my conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.” “Budge,” says</a>
<a id='line_874'>the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you</a>
<a id='line_875'>counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my</a>
<a id='line_876'>conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, (God bless the</a>
<a id='line_877'>mark) is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be</a>
<a id='line_878'>ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the devil himself.</a>
<a id='line_879'>Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my conscience,</a>
<a id='line_880'>my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me</a>
<a id='line_881'>to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will</a>

<a id='line_2166'>Who inward search’d, have livers white as milk,</a>
<a id='line_2167'>And these assume but valour’s excrement</a>
<a id='line_2168'>To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,</a>
<a id='line_2169'>And you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight,</a>

<a id='line_2171'>Making them lightest that wear most of it:</a>
<a id='line_2172'>So are those crisped snaky golden locks</a>

<a id='line_2183'>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</a>
<a id='line_2184'>’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</a>
<a id='line_2185'>Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,</a>

<a id='line_2384'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_2385'>There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper</a>

<a id='line_2387'>Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world</a>
<a id='line_2388'>Could turn so much the constitution</a>

<a id='line_2390'>With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,</a>

<a id='line_2393'></a>
<a id='line_2394'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_2395'>O sweet Portia,</a>
<a id='line_2396'>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</a>
<a id='line_2397'>That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,</a>
<a id='line_2398'>When I did first impart my love to you,</a>
<a id='line_2399'>I freely told you all the wealth I had</a>
<a id='line_2400'>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_2401'>And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</a>
<a id='line_2402'>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</a>
<a id='line_2403'>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</a>
<a id='line_2404'>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</a>
<a id='line_2405'>That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</a>
<a id='line_2406'>I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,</a>
<a id='line_2408'>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</a>
<a id='line_2409'>The paper as the body of my friend,</a>
<a id='line_2410'>And every word in it a gaping wound</a>
<a id='line_2411'>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</a>
<a id='line_2412'>Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?</a>
<a id='line_2413'>From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,</a>
<a id='line_2414'>From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,</a>
<a id='line_2415'>And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch</a>
<a id='line_2416'>Of merchant-marring rocks?</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>SALERIO.</a>
<a id='line_2419'>Not one, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2420'>Besides, it should appear, that if he had</a>
<a id='line_2421'>The present money to discharge the Jew,</a>
<a id='line_2422'>He would not take it. Never did I know</a>
<a id='line_2423'>A creature that did bear the shape of man</a>
<a id='line_2424'>So keen and greedy to confound a man.</a>
<a id='line_2425'>He plies the Duke at morning and at night,</a>
<a id='line_2426'>And doth impeach the freedom of the state</a>
<a id='line_2427'>If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,</a>
<a id='line_2428'>The Duke himself, and the magnificoes</a>
<a id='line_2429'>Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,</a>
<a id='line_2430'>But none can drive him from the envious plea</a>
<a id='line_2431'>Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>JESSICA.</a>
<a id='line_2434'>When I was with him, I have heard him swear</a>
<a id='line_2435'>To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,</a>
<a id='line_2436'>That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh</a>
<a id='line_2437'>Than twenty times the value of the sum</a>
<a id='line_2438'>That he did owe him. And I know, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2439'>If law, authority, and power deny not,</a>
<a id='line_2440'>It will go hard with poor Antonio.</a>

<a id='line_2464'>First go with me to church and call me wife,</a>

<a id='line_2902'>As there is no firm reason to be render’d</a>

<a id='line_2905'>Why he a woollen bagpipe, but of force</a>
<a id='line_2906'>Must yield to such inevitable shame</a>
<a id='line_2907'>As to offend, himself being offended,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</a>

<a id='line_3060'>[_Reads._] _Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your</a>
<a id='line_3061'>letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in</a>
<a id='line_3062'>loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is</a>
<a id='line_3063'>Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the</a>
<a id='line_3064'>Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turn’d o’er many books together. He is</a>
<a id='line_3065'>furnished with my opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the</a>
<a id='line_3066'>greatness whereof I cannot enough commend), comes with him at my</a>

<a id='line_3089'>I am informed throughly of the cause.</a>
<a id='line_3090'>Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?</a>

<a id='line_3105'>[_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not?</a>

<a id='line_3120'>On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.</a>
<a id='line_3121'></a>
<a id='line_3122'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_3123'>The quality of mercy is not strain’d,</a>
<a id='line_3124'>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</a>
<a id='line_3125'>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest,</a>
<a id='line_3126'>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</a>
<a id='line_3127'>’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes</a>
<a id='line_3128'>The throned monarch better than his crown.</a>
<a id='line_3129'>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</a>
<a id='line_3130'>The attribute to awe and majesty,</a>
<a id='line_3131'>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</a>
<a id='line_3132'>But mercy is above this sceptred sway,</a>
<a id='line_3133'>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</a>
<a id='line_3134'>It is an attribute to God himself;</a>
<a id='line_3135'>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</a>
<a id='line_3136'>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</a>
<a id='line_3137'>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</a>
<a id='line_3138'>That in the course of justice none of us</a>
<a id='line_3139'>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</a>
<a id='line_3140'>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</a>
<a id='line_3141'>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</a>
<a id='line_3142'>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,</a>
<a id='line_3143'>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</a>

<a id='line_3149'></a>
<a id='line_3150'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_3151'>Is he not able to discharge the money?</a>
<a id='line_3152'></a>
<a id='line_3153'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_3154'>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court,</a>
<a id='line_3155'>Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,</a>
<a id='line_3156'>I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er</a>
<a id='line_3157'>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.</a>
<a id='line_3158'>If this will not suffice, it must appear</a>

<a id='line_3188'></a>
<a id='line_3189'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_3190'>Why, this bond is forfeit,</a>
<a id='line_3191'>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</a>
<a id='line_3192'>A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</a>
<a id='line_3193'>Nearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful,</a>
<a id='line_3194'>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</a>

<a id='line_3197'>When it is paid according to the tenour.</a>
<a id='line_3198'>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;</a>
<a id='line_3199'>You know the law; your exposition</a>
<a id='line_3200'>Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,</a>
<a id='line_3201'>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</a>
<a id='line_3202'>Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear</a>
<a id='line_3203'>There is no power in the tongue of man</a>
<a id='line_3204'>To alter me. I stay here on my bond.</a>
<a id='line_3205'></a>
<a id='line_3206'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_3207'>Most heartily I do beseech the court</a>

<a id='line_3993'>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</a>
<a id='line_3994'>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</a>
<a id='line_3995'>Or your own honour to contain the ring,</a>
<a id='line_3996'>You would not then have parted with the ring.</a>
<a id='line_3997'>What man is there so much unreasonable,</a>
<a id='line_3998'>If you had pleas’d to have defended it</a>
<a id='line_3999'>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</a>
<a id='line_4000'>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</a>
<a id='line_4001'>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</a>
<a id='line_4002'>I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.</a>
<a id='line_4003'></a>
<a id='line_4004'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_4005'>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,</a>
<a id='line_4006'>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</a>
<a id='line_4007'>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,</a>
<a id='line_4008'>And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,</a>
<a id='line_4009'>And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away,</a>
<a id='line_4010'>Even he that had held up the very life</a>
<a id='line_4011'>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</a>
<a id='line_4012'>I was enforc’d to send it after him.</a>
<a id='line_4013'>I was beset with shame and courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_4014'>My honour would not let ingratitude</a>
<a id='line_4015'>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;</a>
<a id='line_4016'>For by these blessed candles of the night,</a>
<a id='line_4017'>Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d</a>
<a id='line_4018'>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</a>
<a id='line_4019'></a>
<a id='line_4020'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4021'>Let not that doctor e’er come near my house,</a>
<a id='line_4022'>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</a>
<a id='line_4023'>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</a>
<a id='line_4024'>I will become as liberal as you,</a>
<a id='line_4025'>I’ll not deny him anything I have,</a>
<a id='line_4026'>No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.</a>
<a id='line_4027'>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.</a>
<a id='line_4028'>Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus,</a>
<a id='line_4029'>If you do not, if I be left alone,</a>
<a id='line_4030'>Now by mine honour which is yet mine own,</a>
<a id='line_4031'>I’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.</a>
<a id='line_4032'></a>
<a id='line_4033'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_4034'>And I his clerk. Therefore be well advis’d</a>
<a id='line_4035'>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</a>
<a id='line_4036'></a>
<a id='line_4037'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_4038'>Well, do you so. Let not me take him then,</a>
<a id='line_4039'>For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.</a>
<a id='line_4040'></a>
<a id='line_4041'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_4042'>I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.</a>
<a id='line_4043'></a>
<a id='line_4044'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4045'>Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.</a>
<a id='line_4046'></a>
<a id='line_4047'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_4048'>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,</a>
<a id='line_4049'>And in the hearing of these many friends</a>
<a id='line_4050'>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</a>
<a id='line_4051'>Wherein I see myself—</a>
<a id='line_4052'></a>
<a id='line_4053'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4054'>Mark you but that!</a>
<a id='line_4055'>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,</a>
<a id='line_4056'>In each eye one. Swear by your double self,</a>
<a id='line_4057'>And there’s an oath of credit.</a>
<a id='line_4058'></a>
<a id='line_4059'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_4060'>Nay, but hear me.</a>
<a id='line_4061'>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</a>
<a id='line_4062'>I never more will break an oath with thee.</a>
<a id='line_4063'></a>
<a id='line_4064'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_4065'>I once did lend my body for his wealth,</a>
<a id='line_4066'>Which but for him that had your husband’s ring</a>
<a id='line_4067'>Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,</a>
<a id='line_4068'>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</a>
<a id='line_4069'>Will never more break faith advisedly.</a>
<a id='line_4070'></a>
<a id='line_4071'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4072'>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,</a>
<a id='line_4073'>And bid him keep it better than the other.</a>
<a id='line_4074'></a>
<a id='line_4075'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_4076'>Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.</a>
<a id='line_4077'></a>
<a id='line_4078'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_4079'>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</a>
<a id='line_4080'></a>
<a id='line_4081'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4082'>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,</a>
<a id='line_4083'>For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</a>
<a id='line_4084'></a>
<a id='line_4085'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_4086'>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,</a>
<a id='line_4087'>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,</a>
<a id='line_4088'>In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.</a>
<a id='line_4089'></a>
<a id='line_4090'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_4091'>Why, this is like the mending of highways</a>
<a id='line_4092'>In summer, where the ways are fair enough.</a>
<a id='line_4093'>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?</a>
<a id='line_4094'></a>
<a id='line_4095'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4096'>Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz’d.</a>
<a id='line_4097'>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.</a>
<a id='line_4098'>It comes from Padua from Bellario.</a>
<a id='line_4099'>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</a>
<a id='line_4100'>Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here</a>
<a id='line_4101'>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,</a>
<a id='line_4102'>And even but now return’d. I have not yet</a>
<a id='line_4103'>Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,</a>
<a id='line_4104'>And I have better news in store for you</a>
<a id='line_4105'>Than you expect: unseal this letter soon.</a>
<a id='line_4106'>There you shall find three of your argosies</a>
<a id='line_4107'>Are richly come to harbour suddenly.</a>
<a id='line_4108'>You shall not know by what strange accident</a>
<a id='line_4109'>I chanced on this letter.</a>
<a id='line_4110'></a>
<a id='line_4111'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_4112'>I am dumb.</a>
<a id='line_4113'></a>
<a id='line_4114'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_4115'>Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?</a>
<a id='line_4116'></a>
<a id='line_4117'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_4118'>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</a>
<a id='line_4119'></a>
<a id='line_4120'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_4121'>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</a>
<a id='line_4122'>Unless he live until he be a man.</a>
<a id='line_4123'></a>
<a id='line_4124'>BASSANIO.</a>
<a id='line_4125'>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.</a>
<a id='line_4126'>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'>ANTONIO.</a>
<a id='line_4129'>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;</a>
<a id='line_4130'>For here I read for certain that my ships</a>
<a id='line_4131'>Are safely come to road.</a>
<a id='line_4132'></a>
<a id='line_4133'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4134'>How now, Lorenzo!</a>
<a id='line_4135'>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</a>
<a id='line_4136'></a>
<a id='line_4137'>NERISSA.</a>
<a id='line_4138'>Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</a>
<a id='line_4139'>There do I give to you and Jessica,</a>
<a id='line_4140'>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</a>
<a id='line_4141'>After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.</a>
<a id='line_4142'></a>
<a id='line_4143'>LORENZO.</a>
<a id='line_4144'>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</a>
<a id='line_4145'>Of starved people.</a>
<a id='line_4146'></a>
<a id='line_4147'>PORTIA.</a>
<a id='line_4148'>It is almost morning,</a>
<a id='line_4149'>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</a>
<a id='line_4150'>Of these events at full. Let us go in,</a>
<a id='line_4151'>And charge us there upon inter’gatories,</a>
<a id='line_4152'>And we will answer all things faithfully.</a>
<a id='line_4153'></a>
<a id='line_4154'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_4155'>Let it be so. The first inter’gatory</a>
<a id='line_4156'>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</a>
<a id='line_4157'>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</a>
<a id='line_4158'>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</a>
<a id='line_4159'>But were the day come, I should wish it dark</a>
<a id='line_4160'>Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.</a>
<a id='line_4161'>Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing</a>
<a id='line_4162'>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.</a>
<a id='line_4163'></a>
