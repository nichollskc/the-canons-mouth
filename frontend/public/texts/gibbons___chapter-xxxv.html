<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     Invasion Of Gaul By Attila.—He Is Repulsed By Ætius And The</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Visigoths.—Attila Invades And Evacuates Italy.—The Deaths Of</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Attila, Ætius, And Valentinian The Third.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      It was the opinion of Marcian, that war should be avoided, as</a>
<a id='line_7'>      long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honorable peace;</a>
<a id='line_8'>      but it was likewise his opinion, that peace cannot be honorable</a>
<a id='line_9'>      or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to</a>
<a id='line_10'>      war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Attila, who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute.</a>
<a id='line_12'>      The emperor signified to the Barbarians, that they must no longer</a>
<a id='line_13'>      insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of a tribute; that he</a>
<a id='line_14'>      was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful</a>
<a id='line_15'>      friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate</a>
<a id='line_16'>      the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks. The same language,</a>
<a id='line_18'>      even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador</a>
<a id='line_19'>      Apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he</a>
<a id='line_20'>      had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of</a>
<a id='line_21'>      dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared</a>
<a id='line_22'>      to expect from the degenerate Romans. 1 He threatened to chastise</a>
<a id='line_23'>      the rash successor of Theodosius; but he hesitated whether he</a>
<a id='line_24'>      should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or</a>
<a id='line_25'>      the Western empire. While mankind awaited his decision with awful</a>
<a id='line_26'>      suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ravenna and</a>
<a id='line_27'>      Constantinople; and his ministers saluted the two emperors with</a>
<a id='line_28'>      the same haughty declaration. “Attila, my lord, and thy lord,</a>
<a id='line_29'>      commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception.” 2</a>
<a id='line_30'>      But as the Barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the Romans</a>
<a id='line_31'>      of the East, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared</a>
<a id='line_32'>      his resolution of suspending the easy conquest, till he had</a>
<a id='line_33'>      achieved a more glorious and important enterprise. In the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      memorable invasions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally</a>
<a id='line_35'>      attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      particular motives and provocations of Attila can only be</a>
<a id='line_37'>      explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      Valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, under the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      administration of Ætius. 3</a>

<a id='line_52'>      Attila; but the ingenious author, the Abbe Dubos, too often</a>
<a id='line_53'>      bewilders himself in system and conjecture.]</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>      After the death of his rival Boniface, Ætius had prudently</a>
<a id='line_56'>      retired to the tents of the Huns; and he was indebted to their</a>
<a id='line_57'>      alliance for his safety and his restoration. Instead of the</a>
<a id='line_58'>      suppliant language of a guilty exile, he solicited his pardon at</a>
<a id='line_59'>      the head of sixty thousand Barbarians; and the empress Placidia</a>
<a id='line_60'>      confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension, which</a>
<a id='line_61'>      might have been ascribed to clemency, was the effect of weakness</a>
<a id='line_62'>      or fear. She delivered herself, her son Valentinian, and the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      Western empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could</a>
<a id='line_64'>      Placidia protect the son-in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and</a>
<a id='line_65'>      faithful Sebastian, 4 from the implacable persecution which urged</a>
<a id='line_66'>      him from one kingdom to another, till he miserably perished in</a>
<a id='line_67'>      the service of the Vandals. The fortunate Ætius, who was</a>
<a id='line_68'>      immediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice</a>
<a id='line_69'>      invested with the honors of the consulship, assumed, with the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military</a>
<a id='line_71'>      power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contemporary</a>
<a id='line_72'>      writers, the duke, or general, of the Romans of the West. His</a>
<a id='line_73'>      prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple; and</a>
<a id='line_75'>      Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_76'>      while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and</a>
<a id='line_77'>      a patriot, who supported near twenty years the ruins of the</a>
<a id='line_78'>      Western empire. The Gothic historian ingenuously confesses, that</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Ætius was born for the salvation of the Roman republic; 5 and</a>
<a id='line_80'>      the following portrait, though it is drawn in the fairest colors,</a>
<a id='line_81'>      must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than</a>
<a id='line_82'>      of flattery. 411 “His mother was a wealthy and noble Italian, and</a>
<a id='line_83'>      his father Gaudentius, who held a distinguished rank in the</a>
<a id='line_84'>      province of Scythia, gradually rose from the station of a</a>
<a id='line_85'>      military domestic, to the dignity of master of the cavalry. Their</a>
<a id='line_86'>      son, who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards, was</a>
<a id='line_87'>      given as a hostage, first to Alaric, and afterwards to the Huns;</a>
<a id='line_88'>      412 and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of</a>
<a id='line_89'>      the palace, for which he was equally qualified by superior merit.</a>
<a id='line_90'>      The graceful figure of Ætius was not above the middle stature;</a>
<a id='line_91'>      but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty,</a>
<a id='line_92'>      and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing</a>
<a id='line_93'>      a horse, drawing the bow, and darting the javelin. He could</a>
<a id='line_94'>      patiently endure the want of food, or of sleep; and his mind and</a>
<a id='line_95'>      body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts. He</a>
<a id='line_96'>      possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers,</a>
<a id='line_97'>      but injuries: and it was impossible either to corrupt, or</a>
<a id='line_98'>      deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul.” 6 The</a>
<a id='line_99'>      Barbarians, who had seated themselves in the Western provinces,</a>
<a id='line_100'>      were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the</a>
<a id='line_101'>      patrician Ætius. He soothed their passions, consulted their</a>
<a id='line_102'>      prejudices, balanced their interests, and checked their ambition.</a>
<a id='line_103'>      611 A seasonable treaty, which he concluded with Genseric,</a>
<a id='line_104'>      protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals; the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid;</a>
<a id='line_106'>      the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Spain; and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi, whom he had</a>

<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>      From a principle of interest, as well as gratitude, Ætius</a>
<a id='line_177'>      assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns. While he resided</a>
<a id='line_178'>      in their tents as a hostage, or an exile, he had familiarly</a>
<a id='line_179'>      conversed with Attila himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and</a>
<a id='line_180'>      the two famous antagonists appeared to have been connected by a</a>

<a id='line_184'>      specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment, the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian</a>
<a id='line_186'>      conqueror, who pressed the two empires with his innumerable</a>
<a id='line_187'>      armies. His demands were obeyed or eluded. When he claimed the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold, which had been</a>
<a id='line_189'>      fraudulently embezzled, the civil and military governors of</a>
<a id='line_190'>      Noricum were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints: 7</a>
<a id='line_191'>      and it is evident, from their conversation with Maximin and</a>
<a id='line_192'>      Priscus, in the royal village, that the valor and prudence of</a>
<a id='line_193'>      Ætius had not saved the Western Romans from the common ignominy</a>
<a id='line_194'>      of tribute. Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      a salutary peace; and a numerous army of Huns and Alani, whom he</a>
<a id='line_196'>      had attached to his person, was employed in the defence of Gaul.</a>
<a id='line_197'>      Two colonies of these Barbarians were judiciously fixed in the</a>
<a id='line_198'>      territories of Valens and Orleans; 8 and their active cavalry</a>
<a id='line_199'>      secured the important passages of the Rhone and of the Loire.</a>
<a id='line_200'>      These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      subjects than to the enemies of Rome. Their original settlement</a>
<a id='line_202'>      was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest; and the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      province through which they marched was exposed to all the</a>
<a id='line_204'>      calamities of a hostile invasion. 9 Strangers to the emperor or</a>
<a id='line_205'>      the republic, the Alani of Gaul were devoted to the ambition of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      Ætius, and though he might suspect, that, in a contest with</a>
<a id='line_207'>      Attila himself, they would revolt to the standard of their</a>
<a id='line_208'>      national king, the patrician labored to restrain, rather than to</a>

<a id='line_254'>      Gothic king, who had raised the siege with some loss and</a>
<a id='line_255'>      disgrace, was persuaded, for an adequate subsidy, to divert the</a>
<a id='line_256'>      martial valor of his subjects in a Spanish war. Yet Theodoric</a>
<a id='line_257'>      still watched, and eagerly seized, the favorable moment of</a>
<a id='line_258'>      renewing his hostile attempts. The Goths besieged Narbonne, while</a>
<a id='line_259'>      the Belgic provinces were invaded by the Burgundians; and the</a>
<a id='line_260'>      public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union</a>
<a id='line_261'>      of the enemies of Rome. On every side, the activity of Ætius,</a>
<a id='line_262'>      and his Scythian cavalry, opposed a firm and successful</a>
<a id='line_263'>      resistance. Twenty thousand Burgundians were slain in battle; and</a>
<a id='line_264'>      the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the</a>
<a id='line_265'>      mountains of Savoy. 11 The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by</a>
<a id='line_266'>      the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last</a>
<a id='line_267'>      extremities of famine, when Count Litorius, approaching in</a>
<a id='line_268'>      silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him two</a>
<a id='line_269'>      sacks of flour, cut his way through the intrenchments of the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      besiegers. The siege was immediately raised; and the more</a>
<a id='line_271'>      decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of</a>
<a id='line_272'>      Ætius himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand</a>
<a id='line_273'>      Goths. But in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily</a>
<a id='line_274'>      summoned to Italy by some public or private interest, Count</a>
<a id='line_275'>      Litorius succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon</a>
<a id='line_276'>      discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing</a>
<a id='line_277'>      of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war. At</a>
<a id='line_278'>      the head of an army of Huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of</a>
<a id='line_279'>      Thoulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his</a>
<a id='line_280'>      misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made</a>
<a id='line_281'>      desperate. The predictions of the augurs had inspired Litorius</a>
<a id='line_282'>      with the profane confidence that he should enter the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_283'>      capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan</a>
<a id='line_284'>      allies, encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace,</a>
<a id='line_285'>      which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Theodoric. The king of the Goths exhibited in his distress the</a>
<a id='line_287'>      edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation; nor did he</a>
<a id='line_288'>      lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for</a>
<a id='line_289'>      the combat. His soldiers, animated with martial and religious</a>
<a id='line_290'>      enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of Litorius. The conflict was</a>
<a id='line_291'>      obstinate; the slaughter was mutual. The Roman general, after a</a>
<a id='line_292'>      total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful</a>
<a id='line_293'>      rashness, was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse, not</a>
<a id='line_294'>      in his own, but in a hostile triumph; and the misery which he</a>
<a id='line_295'>      experienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the</a>
<a id='line_296'>      compassion of the Barbarians themselves. 12 Such a loss, in a</a>
<a id='line_297'>      country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted,</a>
<a id='line_298'>      could not easily be repaired; and the Goths, assuming, in their</a>
<a id='line_299'>      turn, the sentiments of ambition and revenge, would have planted</a>
<a id='line_300'>      their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone, if the</a>
<a id='line_301'>      presence of Ætius had not restored strength and discipline to</a>
<a id='line_302'>      the Romans. 13 The two armies expected the signal of a decisive</a>
<a id='line_303'>      action; but the generals, who were conscious of each other’s</a>
<a id='line_304'>      force, and doubtful of their own superiority, prudently sheathed</a>
<a id='line_305'>      their swords in the field of battle; and their reconciliation was</a>
<a id='line_306'>      permanent and sincere. Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, appears</a>
<a id='line_307'>      to have deserved the love of his subjects, the confidence of his</a>
<a id='line_308'>      allies, and the esteem of mankind. His throne was surrounded by</a>
<a id='line_309'>      six valiant sons, who were educated with equal care in the</a>
<a id='line_310'>      exercises of the Barbarian camp, and in those of the Gallic</a>
<a id='line_311'>      schools: from the study of the Roman jurisprudence, they acquired</a>
<a id='line_312'>      the theory, at least, of law and justice; and the harmonious</a>
<a id='line_313'>      sense of Virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their</a>
<a id='line_314'>      native manners. 14 The two daughters of the Gothic king were</a>
<a id='line_315'>      given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the Suevi</a>
<a id='line_316'>      and of the Vandals, who reigned in Spain and Africa: but these</a>
<a id='line_317'>      illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord. The</a>
<a id='line_318'>      queen of the Suevi bewailed the death of a husband inhumanly</a>
<a id='line_319'>      massacred by her brother. The princess of the Vandals was the</a>
<a id='line_320'>      victim of a jealous tyrant, whom she called her father. The cruel</a>
<a id='line_321'>      Genseric suspected that his son’s wife had conspired to poison</a>
<a id='line_322'>      him; the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her</a>
<a id='line_323'>      nose and ears; and the unhappy daughter of Theodoric was</a>
<a id='line_324'>      ignominiously returned to the court of Thoulouse in that deformed</a>
<a id='line_325'>      and mutilated condition. This horrid act, which must seem</a>
<a id='line_326'>      incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator;</a>
<a id='line_327'>      but Theodoric was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king,</a>
<a id='line_328'>      to revenge such irreparable injuries. The Imperial ministers, who</a>
<a id='line_329'>      always cherished the discord of the Barbarians, would have</a>
<a id='line_330'>      supplied the Goths with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the</a>
<a id='line_331'>      African war; and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to</a>
<a id='line_332'>      himself, if the artful Vandal had not armed, in his cause, the</a>
<a id='line_333'>      formidable power of the Huns. His rich gifts and pressing</a>
<a id='line_334'>      solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila; and the designs of</a>

<a id='line_391'>      hereditary succession in the noble family of the Merovingians. 16</a>
<a id='line_392'>      These princes were elevated on a buckler, the symbol of military</a>
<a id='line_393'>      command; 17 and the royal fashion of long hair was the ensign of</a>

<a id='line_395'>      and dressed with singular care, hung down in flowing ringlets on</a>

<a id='line_397'>      obliged, either by law or custom, to shave the hinder part of</a>
<a id='line_398'>      their head, to comb their hair over the forehead, and to content</a>
<a id='line_399'>      themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers. 18 The lofty</a>
<a id='line_400'>      stature of the Franks, and their blue eyes, denoted a Germanic</a>
<a id='line_401'>      origin; their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of</a>
<a id='line_402'>      their limbs; a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt;</a>
<a id='line_403'>      their bodies were protected by a large shield; and these warlike</a>
<a id='line_404'>      Barbarians were trained, from their earliest youth, to run, to</a>
<a id='line_405'>      leap, to swim; to dart the javelin, or battle-axe, with unerring</a>
<a id='line_406'>      aim; to advance, without hesitation, against a superior enemy;</a>
<a id='line_407'>      and to maintain, either in life or death, the invincible</a>
<a id='line_408'>      reputation of their ancestors. 19 Clodion, the first of their</a>
<a id='line_409'>      long-haired kings, whose name and actions are mentioned in</a>
<a id='line_410'>      authentic history, held his residence at Dispargum, 20 a village</a>
<a id='line_411'>      or fortress, whose place may be assigned between Louvain and</a>
<a id='line_412'>      Brussels. From the report of his spies, the king of the Franks</a>
<a id='line_413'>      was informed, that the defenceless state of the second Belgic</a>
<a id='line_414'>      must yield, on the slightest attack, to the valor of his</a>
<a id='line_415'>      subjects. He boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses</a>
<a id='line_416'>      of the Carbonarian forest; 21 occupied Tournay and Cambray, the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      only cities which existed in the fifth century, and extended his</a>
<a id='line_418'>      conquests as far as the River Somme, over a desolate country,</a>
<a id='line_419'>      whose cultivation and populousness are the effects of more recent</a>
<a id='line_420'>      industry. 22 While Clodion lay encamped in the plains of Artois,</a>
<a id='line_421'>      23 and celebrated, with vain and ostentatious security, the</a>
<a id='line_422'>      marriage, perhaps, of his son, the nuptial feast was interrupted</a>
<a id='line_423'>      by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of Ætius, who had</a>
<a id='line_424'>      passed the Somme at the head of his light cavalry. The tables,</a>
<a id='line_425'>      which had been spread under the shelter of a hill, along the</a>
<a id='line_426'>      banks of a pleasant stream, were rudely overturned; the Franks</a>
<a id='line_427'>      were oppressed before they could recover their arms, or their</a>
<a id='line_428'>      ranks; and their unavailing valor was fatal only to themselves.</a>
<a id='line_429'>      The loaded wagons, which had followed their march, afforded a</a>
<a id='line_430'>      rich booty; and the virgin-bride, with her female attendants,</a>
<a id='line_431'>      submitted to the new lovers, who were imposed on them by the</a>
<a id='line_432'>      chance of war. This advance, which had been obtained by the skill</a>
<a id='line_433'>      and activity of Ætius, might reflect some disgrace on the</a>
<a id='line_434'>      military prudence of Clodion; but the king of the Franks soon</a>
<a id='line_435'>      regained his strength and reputation, and still maintained the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      possession of his Gallic kingdom from the Rhine to the Somme. 24</a>
<a id='line_437'>      Under his reign, and most probably from the enterprising spirit</a>
<a id='line_438'>      of his subjects, his three capitals, Mentz, Treves, and Cologne,</a>
<a id='line_439'>      experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice. The</a>
<a id='line_440'>      distress of Cologne was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of</a>
<a id='line_441'>      the same Barbarians, who evacuated the ruins of Treves; and</a>
<a id='line_442'>      Treves, which in the space of forty years had been four times</a>
<a id='line_443'>      besieged and pillaged, was disposed to lose the memory of her</a>
<a id='line_444'>      afflictions in the vain amusements of the Circus. 25 The death of</a>
<a id='line_445'>      Clodion, after a reign of twenty years, exposed his kingdom to</a>
<a id='line_446'>      the discord and ambition of his two sons. Meroveus, the younger,</a>

<a id='line_453'>      and the king of the Huns embraced an alliance, which facilitated</a>

<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>      When Attila declared his resolution of supporting the cause of</a>
<a id='line_553'>      his allies, the Vandals and the Franks, at the same time, and</a>
<a id='line_554'>      almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry, the savage monarch</a>
<a id='line_555'>      professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess</a>
<a id='line_556'>      Honoria. The sister of Valentinian was educated in the palace of</a>
<a id='line_557'>      Ravenna; and as her marriage might be productive of some danger</a>
<a id='line_558'>      to the state, she was raised, by the title of Augusta, 28 above</a>
<a id='line_559'>      the hopes of the most presumptuous subject. But the fair Honoria</a>
<a id='line_560'>      had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age, than she</a>
<a id='line_561'>      detested the importunate greatness which must forever exclude her</a>
<a id='line_562'>      from the comforts of honorable love; in the midst of vain and</a>
<a id='line_563'>      unsatisfactory pomp, Honoria sighed, yielded to the impulse of</a>
<a id='line_564'>      nature, and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain</a>
<a id='line_565'>      Eugenius. Her guilt and shame (such is the absurd language of</a>
<a id='line_566'>      imperious man) were soon betrayed by the appearances of</a>
<a id='line_567'>      pregnancy; but the disgrace of the royal family was published to</a>
<a id='line_568'>      the world by the imprudence of the empress Placidia who dismissed</a>
<a id='line_569'>      her daughter, after a strict and shameful confinement, to a</a>
<a id='line_570'>      remote exile at Constantinople. The unhappy princess passed</a>
<a id='line_571'>      twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of</a>
<a id='line_572'>      Theodosius, and their chosen virgins; to whose crown Honoria</a>
<a id='line_573'>      could no longer aspire, and whose monastic assiduity of prayer,</a>
<a id='line_574'>      fasting, and vigils, she reluctantly imitated. Her impatience of</a>
<a id='line_575'>      long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and</a>
<a id='line_576'>      desperate resolution. The name of Attila was familiar and</a>
<a id='line_577'>      formidable at Constantinople; and his frequent embassies</a>
<a id='line_578'>      entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the</a>
<a id='line_579'>      Imperial palace. In the pursuit of love, or rather of revenge,</a>
<a id='line_580'>      the daughter of Placidia sacrificed every duty and every</a>
<a id='line_581'>      prejudice; and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a</a>
<a id='line_582'>      Barbarian, of whose language she was ignorant, whose figure was</a>
<a id='line_583'>      scarcely human, and whose religion and manners she abhorred. By</a>
<a id='line_584'>      the ministry of a faithful eunuch, she transmitted to Attila a</a>
<a id='line_585'>      ring, the pledge of her affection; and earnestly conjured him to</a>
<a id='line_586'>      claim her as a lawful spouse, to whom he had been secretly</a>
<a id='line_587'>      betrothed. These indecent advances were received, however, with</a>
<a id='line_588'>      coldness and disdain; and the king of the Huns continued to</a>
<a id='line_589'>      multiply the number of his wives, till his love was awakened by</a>
<a id='line_590'>      the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice. The invasion</a>
<a id='line_591'>      of Gaul was preceded, and justified, by a formal demand of the</a>
<a id='line_592'>      princess Honoria, with a just and equal share of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_593'>      patrimony. His predecessors, the ancient Tanjous, had often</a>
<a id='line_594'>      addressed, in the same hostile and peremptory manner, the</a>
<a id='line_595'>      daughters of China; and the pretensions of Attila were not less</a>
<a id='line_596'>      offensive to the majesty of Rome. A firm, but temperate, refusal</a>
<a id='line_597'>      was communicated to his ambassadors. The right of female</a>
<a id='line_598'>      succession, though it might derive a specious argument from the</a>
<a id='line_599'>      recent examples of Placidia and Pulcheria, was strenuously</a>
<a id='line_600'>      denied; and the indissoluble engagements of Honoria were opposed</a>
<a id='line_601'>      to the claims of her Scythian lover. 29 On the discovery of her</a>
<a id='line_602'>      connection with the king of the Huns, the guilty princess had</a>
<a id='line_603'>      been sent away, as an object of horror, from Constantinople to</a>
<a id='line_604'>      Italy: her life was spared; but the ceremony of her marriage was</a>
<a id='line_605'>      performed with some obscure and nominal husband, before she was</a>
<a id='line_606'>      immured in a perpetual prison, to bewail those crimes and</a>

<a id='line_627'>      A native of Gaul, and a contemporary, the learned and eloquent</a>

<a id='line_630'>      history of the war of Attila. If the modesty of Sidonius had not</a>
<a id='line_631'>      discouraged him from the prosecution of this interesting work, 31</a>
<a id='line_632'>      the historian would have related, with the simplicity of truth,</a>
<a id='line_633'>      those memorable events, to which the poet, in vague and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_634'>      metaphors, has concisely alluded. 32 The kings and nations of</a>
<a id='line_635'>      Germany and Scythia, from the Volga perhaps to the Danube, obeyed</a>
<a id='line_636'>      the warlike summons of Attila. From the royal village, in the</a>
<a id='line_637'>      plains of Hungary his standard moved towards the West; and after</a>
<a id='line_638'>      a march of seven or eight hundred miles, he reached the conflux</a>
<a id='line_639'>      of the Rhine and the Neckar, where he was joined by the Franks,</a>
<a id='line_640'>      who adhered to his ally, the elder of the sons of Clodion. A</a>
<a id='line_641'>      troop of light Barbarians, who roamed in quest of plunder, might</a>
<a id='line_642'>      choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the</a>
<a id='line_643'>      ice; but the innumerable cavalry of the Huns required such plenty</a>
<a id='line_644'>      of forage and provisions, as could be procured only in a milder</a>
<a id='line_645'>      season; the Hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of</a>
<a id='line_646'>      boats; and the hostile myriads were poured, with resistless</a>
<a id='line_647'>      violence, into the Belgic provinces. 33 The consternation of Gaul</a>
<a id='line_648'>      was universal; and the various fortunes of its cities have been</a>
<a id='line_649'>      adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles. 34 Troyes was</a>
<a id='line_650'>      saved by the merits of St. Lupus; St. Servatius was removed from</a>
<a id='line_651'>      the world, that he might not behold the ruin of Tongres; and the</a>
<a id='line_652'>      prayers of St. Genevieve diverted the march of Attila from the</a>
<a id='line_653'>      neighborhood of Paris. But as the greatest part of the Gallic</a>
<a id='line_654'>      cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers, they were</a>
<a id='line_655'>      besieged and stormed by the Huns; who practised, in the example</a>
<a id='line_656'>      of Metz, 35 their customary maxims of war. They involved, in a</a>
<a id='line_657'>      promiscuous massacre, the priests who served at the altar, and</a>
<a id='line_658'>      the infants, who, in the hour of danger, had been providently</a>
<a id='line_659'>      baptized by the bishop; the flourishing city was delivered to the</a>
<a id='line_660'>      flames, and a solitary chapel of St. Stephen marked the place</a>
<a id='line_661'>      where it formerly stood. From the Rhine and the Moselle, Attila</a>
<a id='line_662'>      advanced into the heart of Gaul; crossed the Seine at Auxerre;</a>
<a id='line_663'>      and, after a long and laborious march, fixed his camp under the</a>
<a id='line_664'>      walls of Orleans. He was desirous of securing his conquests by</a>
<a id='line_665'>      the possession of an advantageous post, which commanded the</a>
<a id='line_666'>      passage of the Loire; and he depended on the secret invitation of</a>
<a id='line_667'>      Sangiban, king of the Alani, who had promised to betray the city,</a>
<a id='line_668'>      and to revolt from the service of the empire. But this</a>
<a id='line_669'>      treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed: Orleans had</a>
<a id='line_670'>      been strengthened with recent fortifications; and the assaults of</a>
<a id='line_671'>      the Huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valor of the</a>
<a id='line_672'>      soldiers, or citizens, who defended the place. The pastoral</a>
<a id='line_673'>      diligence of Anianus, a bishop of primitive sanctity and</a>
<a id='line_674'>      consummate prudence, exhausted every art of religious policy to</a>
<a id='line_675'>      support their courage, till the arrival of the expected succors.</a>
<a id='line_676'>      After an obstinate siege, the walls were shaken by the battering</a>
<a id='line_677'>      rams; the Huns had already occupied the suburbs; and the people,</a>
<a id='line_678'>      who were incapable of bearing arms, lay prostrate in prayer.</a>
<a id='line_679'>      Anianus, who anxiously counted the days and hours, despatched a</a>
<a id='line_680'>      trusty messenger to observe, from the rampart, the face of the</a>

<a id='line_682'>      could inspire hope or comfort; but, in his third report, he</a>
<a id='line_683'>      mentioned a small cloud, which he had faintly descried at the</a>

<a id='line_685'>      bishop, in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude</a>
<a id='line_686'>      repeated after him, “It is the aid of God.” The remote object, on</a>

<a id='line_755'>      Attila, awaited with doubtful and venal faith, the event of the</a>
<a id='line_756'>      war. The patrician passed the Alps at the head of some troops,</a>
<a id='line_757'>      whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army.</a>
<a id='line_758'>      36 But on his arrival at Arles, or Lyons, he was confounded by</a>
<a id='line_759'>      the intelligence, that the Visigoths, refusing to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_760'>      defence of Gaul, had determined to expect, within their own</a>
<a id='line_761'>      territories, the formidable invader, whom they professed to</a>
<a id='line_762'>      despise. The senator Avitus, who, after the honorable exercise of</a>
<a id='line_763'>      the Prætorian præfecture, had retired to his estate in</a>
<a id='line_764'>      Auvergne, was persuaded to accept the important embassy, which he</a>
<a id='line_765'>      executed with ability and success. He represented to Theodoric,</a>
<a id='line_766'>      that an ambitious conqueror, who aspired to the dominion of the</a>
<a id='line_767'>      earth, could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance</a>
<a id='line_768'>      of the powers whom he labored to oppress. The lively eloquence of</a>
<a id='line_769'>      Avitus inflamed the Gothic warriors, by the description of the</a>
<a id='line_770'>      injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns; whose</a>
<a id='line_771'>      implacable fury still pursued them from the Danube to the foot of</a>
<a id='line_772'>      the Pyrenees. He strenuously urged, that it was the duty of every</a>
<a id='line_773'>      Christian to save, from sacrilegious violation, the churches of</a>
<a id='line_774'>      God, and the relics of the saints: that it was the interest of</a>
<a id='line_775'>      every Barbarian, who had acquired a settlement in Gaul, to defend</a>
<a id='line_776'>      the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his use,</a>
<a id='line_777'>      against the desolation of the Scythian shepherds. Theodoric</a>
<a id='line_778'>      yielded to the evidence of truth; adopted the measure at once the</a>
<a id='line_779'>      most prudent and the most honorable; and declared, that, as the</a>
<a id='line_780'>      faithful ally of Ætius and the Romans, he was ready to expose</a>
<a id='line_781'>      his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul. 37 The</a>
<a id='line_782'>      Visigoths, who, at that time, were in the mature vigor of their</a>
<a id='line_783'>      fame and power, obeyed with alacrity the signal of war; prepared</a>
<a id='line_784'>      their arms and horses, and assembled under the standard of their</a>
<a id='line_785'>      aged king, who was resolved, with his two eldest sons, Torismond</a>
<a id='line_786'>      and Theodoric, to command in person his numerous and valiant</a>
<a id='line_787'>      people. The example of the Goths determined several tribes or</a>
<a id='line_788'>      nations, that seemed to fluctuate between the Huns and the</a>
<a id='line_789'>      Romans. The indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually</a>
<a id='line_790'>      collected the troops of Gaul and Germany, who had formerly</a>
<a id='line_791'>      acknowledged themselves the subjects, or soldiers, of the</a>
<a id='line_792'>      republic, but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service,</a>

<a id='line_797'>      conduct of Ætius and Theodoric, advanced, by rapid marches to</a>
<a id='line_798'>      relieve Orleans, and to give battle to the innumerable host of</a>

<a id='line_832'>      foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of Gaul,</a>

<a id='line_837'>      pressed, and sometimes engaged, the troops whom Attila had posted</a>

<a id='line_841'>      Gepidae, in which fifteen thousand 40 Barbarians were slain, was</a>
<a id='line_842'>      a prelude to a more general and decisive action. The Catalaunian</a>
<a id='line_843'>      fields 41 spread themselves round Chalons, and extend, according</a>
<a id='line_844'>      to the vague measurement of Jornandes, to the length of one</a>
<a id='line_845'>      hundred and fifty, and the breadth of one hundred miles, over the</a>
<a id='line_846'>      whole province, which is entitled to the appellation of a</a>
<a id='line_847'>      champaign country. 42 This spacious plain was distinguished,</a>
<a id='line_848'>      however, by some inequalities of ground; and the importance of a</a>
<a id='line_849'>      height, which commanded the camp of Attila, was understood and</a>
<a id='line_850'>      disputed by the two generals. The young and valiant Torismond</a>
<a id='line_851'>      first occupied the summit; the Goths rushed with irresistible</a>
<a id='line_852'>      weight on the Huns, who labored to ascend from the opposite side:</a>
<a id='line_853'>      and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the</a>
<a id='line_854'>      troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory. The</a>
<a id='line_855'>      anxiety of Attila prompted him to consult his priests and</a>
<a id='line_856'>      haruspices. It was reported, that, after scrutinizing the</a>
<a id='line_857'>      entrails of victims, and scraping their bones, they revealed, in</a>
<a id='line_858'>      mysterious language, his own defeat, with the death of his</a>
<a id='line_859'>      principal adversary; and that the Barbarians, by accepting the</a>
<a id='line_860'>      equivalent, expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior</a>
<a id='line_861'>      merit of Ætius. But the unusual despondency, which seemed to</a>
<a id='line_862'>      prevail among the Huns, engaged Attila to use the expedient, so</a>
<a id='line_863'>      familiar to the generals of antiquity, of animating his troops by</a>
<a id='line_864'>      a military oration; and his language was that of a king, who had</a>
<a id='line_865'>      often fought and conquered at their head. 43 He pressed them to</a>
<a id='line_866'>      consider their past glory, their actual danger, and their future</a>
<a id='line_867'>      hopes. The same fortune, which opened the deserts and morasses of</a>
<a id='line_868'>      Scythia to their unarmed valor, which had laid so many warlike</a>
<a id='line_869'>      nations prostrate at their feet, had reserved the joys of this</a>
<a id='line_870'>      memorable field for the consummation of their victories. The</a>
<a id='line_871'>      cautious steps of their enemies, their strict alliance, and their</a>
<a id='line_872'>      advantageous posts, he artfully represented as the effects, not</a>
<a id='line_873'>      of prudence, but of fear. The Visigoths alone were the strength</a>
<a id='line_874'>      and nerves of the opposite army; and the Huns might securely</a>
<a id='line_875'>      trample on the degenerate Romans, whose close and compact order</a>
<a id='line_876'>      betrayed their apprehensions, and who were equally incapable of</a>
<a id='line_877'>      supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle. The</a>
<a id='line_878'>      doctrine of predestination, so favorable to martial virtue, was</a>
<a id='line_879'>      carefully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who assured his</a>
<a id='line_880'>      subjects, that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were safe and</a>
<a id='line_881'>      invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring</a>
<a id='line_882'>      Fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious</a>
<a id='line_883'>      peace. “I myself,” continued Attila, “will throw the first</a>
<a id='line_884'>      javelin, and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his</a>
<a id='line_885'>      sovereign, is devoted to inevitable death.” The spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_886'>      Barbarians was rekindled by the presence, the voice, and the</a>
<a id='line_887'>      example of their intrepid leader; and Attila, yielding to their</a>
<a id='line_888'>      impatience, immediately formed his order of battle. At the head</a>
<a id='line_889'>      of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied in person the centre</a>
<a id='line_890'>      of the line. The nations subject to his empire, the Rugians, the</a>
<a id='line_891'>      Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Burgundians, were</a>
<a id='line_892'>      extended on either hand, over the ample space of the Catalaunian</a>
<a id='line_893'>      fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the</a>
<a id='line_894'>      Gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the</a>
<a id='line_895'>      Ostrogoths, were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes</a>
<a id='line_896'>      of the Visigoths. The disposition of the allies was regulated by</a>
<a id='line_897'>      a different principle. Sangiban, the faithless king of the Alani,</a>
<a id='line_898'>      was placed in the centre, where his motions might be strictly</a>
<a id='line_899'>      watched, and that the treachery might be instantly punished.</a>
<a id='line_900'>      Ætius assumed the command of the left, and Theodoric of the</a>
<a id='line_901'>      right wing; while Torismond still continued to occupy the heights</a>
<a id='line_902'>      which appear to have stretched on the flank, and perhaps the</a>
<a id='line_903'>      rear, of the Scythian army. The nations from the Volga to the</a>
<a id='line_904'>      Atlantic were assembled on the plain of Chalons; but many of</a>
<a id='line_905'>      these nations had been divided by faction, or conquest, or</a>
<a id='line_906'>      emigration; and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns, which</a>

<a id='line_956'>      in which the archers of Scythia might signalize their superior</a>
<a id='line_957'>      dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were</a>

<a id='line_959'>      the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_960'>      centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other, and</a>
<a id='line_961'>      wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole</a>
<a id='line_962'>      force against the Visigoths. As Theodoric rode along the ranks,</a>
<a id='line_963'>      to animate his troops, he received a mortal stroke from the</a>
<a id='line_964'>      javelin of Andages, a noble Ostrogoth, and immediately fell from</a>
<a id='line_965'>      his horse. The wounded king was oppressed in the general</a>
<a id='line_966'>      disorder, and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and</a>
<a id='line_967'>      this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of</a>
<a id='line_968'>      the haruspices. Attila already exulted in the confidence of</a>
<a id='line_969'>      victory, when the valiant Torismond descended from the hills, and</a>
<a id='line_970'>      verified the remainder of the prediction. The Visigoths, who had</a>
<a id='line_971'>      been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the</a>
<a id='line_972'>      Alani, gradually restored their order of battle; and the Huns</a>
<a id='line_973'>      were undoubtedly vanquished, since Attila was compelled to</a>
<a id='line_974'>      retreat. He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private</a>

<a id='line_1008'>      But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      anxiety. The inconsiderate courage of Torismond was tempted to</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      urge the pursuit, till he unexpectedly found himself, with a few</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      followers, in the midst of the Scythian wagons. In the confusion</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      of a nocturnal combat, he was thrown from his horse; and the</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      Gothic prince must have perished like his father, if his youthful</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      strength, and the intrepid zeal of his companions, had not</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      rescued him from this dangerous situation. In the same manner,</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      but on the left of the line, Ætius himself, separated from his</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      over the plains of Chalons; and at length reached the camp of the</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      Goths, which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      shields, till the dawn of day. The Imperial general was soon</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      satisfied of the defeat of Attila, who still remained inactive</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      within his intrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      scene, he observed, with secret satisfaction, that the loss had</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      principally fallen on the Barbarians. The body of Theodoric,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      pierced with honorable wounds, was discovered under a heap of the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      slain: his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father;</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations, and his</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      The Goths, clashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      son Torismond, to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      success; and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      sacred portion of his paternal inheritance. Yet the Goths</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      their formidable antagonist; and their historian has compared</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      Attila to a lion encompassed in his den, and threatening his</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and nations who might have</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      deserted his standard in the hour of distress, were made sensible</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      inevitable danger. All his instruments of martial music</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance; and</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      intrenchments. It was determined, in a general council of war, to</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      besiege the king of the Huns in his camp, to intercept his</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      provisions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      treaty or an unequal combat. But the impatience of the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures; and the</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      mature policy of Ætius was apprehensive that, after the</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppressed by the</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      pride and power of the Gothic nation. The patrician exerted the</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      which the son of Theodoric considered as a duty; represented,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      with seeming affection and real truth, the dangers of absence and</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      delay and persuaded Torismond to disappoint, by his speedy</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      return, the ambitious designs of his brothers, who might occupy</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      the throne and treasures of Thoulouse. 46 After the departure of</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      the Goths, and the separation of the allied army, Attila was</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      Chalons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      several days within the circle of his wagons, and his retreat</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      beyond the Rhine confessed the last victory which was achieved in</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      the name of the Western empire. Meroveus and his Franks,</a>

<a id='line_1065'>      strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      continued to follow the rear of the Huns till they reached the</a>

<a id='line_1068'>      Attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return,</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      that they exercised the cruelties which, about fourscore years</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      afterwards, were revenged by the son of Clovis. They massacred</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      their hostages, as well as their captives: two hundred young</a>

<a id='line_1076'>      limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and</a>

<a id='line_1105'>      Neither the spirit, nor the forces, nor the reputation, of</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      Attila, were impaired by the failure of the Gallic expedition. In</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      Honoria, and her patrimonial treasures. The demand was again</a>

<a id='line_1110'>      field, passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged Aquileia with</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      an innumerable host of Barbarians. Those Barbarians were</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege, which,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      even among the ancients, required some knowledge, or at least</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      some practice, of the mechanic arts. But the labor of many</a>
<a id='line_1115'>      thousand provincials and captives, whose lives were sacrificed</a>
<a id='line_1116'>      without pity, might execute the most painful and dangerous work.</a>
<a id='line_1117'>      The skill of the Roman artists might be corrupted to the</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      destruction of their country. The walls of Aquileia were</a>
<a id='line_1119'>      assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, movable</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      turrets, and engines, that threw stones, darts, and fire; 48 and</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope,</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      fear, emulation, and interest, to subvert the only barrier which</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      delayed the conquest of Italy. Aquileia was at that period one of</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      the richest, the most populous, and the strongest of the maritime</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      cities of the Adriatic coast. The Gothic auxiliaries, who</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      appeared to have served under their native princes, Alaric and</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      Antala, communicated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      their ancestors had opposed to a fierce, inexorable Barbarian,</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      who disgraced the majesty of the Roman purple. Three months were</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      consumed without effect in the siege of the Aquileia; till the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      want of provisions, and the clamors of his army, compelled Attila</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      to relinquish the enterprise; and reluctantly to issue his</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      orders, that the troops should strike their tents the next</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      morning, and begin their retreat. But as he rode round the walls,</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      pensive, angry, and disappointed, he observed a stork preparing</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      to leave her nest, in one of the towers, and to fly with her</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      infant family towards the country. He seized, with the ready</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident, which chance</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a loud and</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats,</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      solitude. 49 The favorable omen inspired an assurance of victory;</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigor; a large</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      taken her flight; the Huns mounted to the assault with</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      irresistible fury; and the succeeding generation could scarcely</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      discover the ruins of Aquileia. 50 After this dreadful</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      chastisement, Attila pursued his march; and as he passed, the</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      cities of Altinum, Concordia, and Padua, were reduced into heaps</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      of stones and ashes. The inland towns, Vicenza, Verona, and</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      Bergamo, were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns. Milan</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      and Pavia submitted, without resistance, to the loss of their</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      wealth; and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      the flames the public, as well as private, buildings, and spared</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      the lives of the captive multitude. The popular traditions of</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      Comum, Turin, or Modena, may justly be suspected; yet they concur</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      with more authentic evidence to prove, that Attila spread his</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      ravages over the rich plains of modern Lombardy; which are</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      divided by the Po, and bounded by the Alps and Apennine. 51 When</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      he took possession of the royal palace of Milan, he was surprised</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      Caesars seated on their throne, and the princes of Scythia</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      prostrate at their feet. The revenge which Attila inflicted on</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      this monument of Roman vanity, was harmless and ingenious. He</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes; and</a>

<a id='line_1170'>      the throne of the Scythian monarch. 52 The spectators must have</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration; and were</a>

<a id='line_1253'>      of vessels through some secret and narrow channels. 56 Till the</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      middle of the fifth century, these remote and sequestered spots</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      remained without cultivation, with few inhabitants, and almost</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      without a name. But the manners of the Venetian fugitives, their</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      arts and their government, were gradually formed by their new</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      situation; and one of the epistles of Cassiodorus, 57 which</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      describes their condition about seventy years afterwards, may be</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      considered as the primitive monument of the republic. 571 The</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      minister of Theodoric compares them, in his quaint declamatory</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      style, to water-fowl, who had fixed their nests on the bosom of</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      the waves; and though he allows, that the Venetian provinces had</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      formerly contained many noble families, he insinuates, that they</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      poverty. Fish was the common, and almost the universal, food of</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      every rank: their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt,</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange of that</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      commodity, so essential to human life, was substituted in the</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      neighboring markets to the currency of gold and silver. A people,</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      water, soon became alike familiar with the two elements; and the</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity. The</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      islanders, who, from Grado to Chiozza, were intimately connected</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      with each other, penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      secure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      canals. Their vessels, which were continually increasing in size</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      and number, visited all the harbors of the Gulf; and the marriage</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      which Venice annually celebrates with the Adriatic, was</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      contracted in her early infancy. The epistle of Cassiodorus, the</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      Prætorian præfect, is addressed to the maritime tribunes; and</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate the zeal</a>

<a id='line_1361'>      The Italians, who had long since renounced the exercise of arms,</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      were surprised, after forty years’ peace, by the approach of a</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      formidable Barbarian, whom they abhorred, as the enemy of their</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      religion, as well as of their republic. Amidst the general</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      consternation, Ætius alone was incapable of fear; but it was</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      impossible that he should achieve, alone and unassisted, any</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      military exploits worthy of his former renown. The Barbarians who</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      had defended Gaul, refused to march to the relief of Italy; and</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      the succors promised by the Eastern emperor were distant and</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      doubtful. Since Ætius, at the head of his domestic troops, still</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      maintained the field, and harassed or retarded the march of</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      Attila, he never showed himself more truly great, than at the</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      people. 59 If the mind of Valentinian had been susceptible of any</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      generous sentiments, he would have chosen such a general for his</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      example and his guide. But the timid grandson of Theodosius,</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      instead of sharing the dangers, escaped from the sound of war;</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      and his hasty retreat from Ravenna to Rome, from an impregnable</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      abandoning Italy, as soon as the danger should approach his</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      Imperial person. This shameful abdication was suspended, however,</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      by the spirit of doubt and delay, which commonly adheres to</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      pusillanimous counsels, and sometimes corrects their pernicious</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      tendency. The Western emperor, with the senate and people of</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      Rome, embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating, by a</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      solemn and suppliant embassy, the wrath of Attila. This important</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      commission was accepted by Avienus, who, from his birth and</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      riches, his consular dignity, the numerous train of his clients,</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      and his personal abilities, held the first rank in the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      senate. The specious and artful character of Avienus 60 was</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      admirably qualified to conduct a negotiation either of public or</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      private interest: his colleague Trigetius had exercised the</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      Prætorian præfecture of Italy; and Leo, bishop of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock. The</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      genius of Leo 61 was exercised and displayed in the public</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      misfortunes; and he has deserved the appellation of Great, by the</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      successful zeal with which he labored to establish his opinions</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      and his authority, under the venerable names of orthodox faith</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      and ecclesiastical discipline. The Roman ambassadors were</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      introduced to the tent of Attila, as he lay encamped at the place</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      where the slow-winding Mincius is lost in the foaming waves of</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      the Lake Benacus, 62 and trampled, with his Scythian cavalry, the</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      farms of Catullus and Virgil. 63 The Barbarian monarch listened</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      with favorable, and even respectful, attention; and the</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      deliverance of Italy was purchased by the immense ransom, or</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      dowry, of the princess Honoria. The state of his army might</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      facilitate the treaty, and hasten his retreat. Their martial</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      spirit was relaxed by the wealth and idolence of a warm climate.</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      The shepherds of the North, whose ordinary food consisted of milk</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      and raw flesh, indulged themselves too freely in the use of</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      bread, of wine, and of meat, prepared and seasoned by the arts of</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      cookery; and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      injuries of the Italians. 64 When Attila declared his resolution</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of Rome, he was</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      admonished by his friends, as well as by his enemies, that Alaric</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city. His mind,</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      superior to real danger, was assaulted by imaginary terrors; nor</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      could he escape the influence of superstition, which had so often</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      been subservient to his designs. 65 The pressing eloquence of</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      Leo, his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes, excited the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      veneration of Attila for the spiritual father of the Christians.</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      The apparition of the two apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, who</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      menaced the Barbarian with instant death, if he rejected the</a>

<a id='line_1736'>      considered as the accomplice of his own shame, excited Maximus to</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      a just revenge; the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition;</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      and he might reasonably aspire, by the free suffrage of the Roman</a>

<a id='line_1740'>      Valentinian, who supposed that every human breast was devoid,</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      like his own, of friendship and gratitude, had imprudently</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      Ætius. Two of these, of Barbarian race were persuaded to execute</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      a sacred and honorable duty, by punishing with death the assassin</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      of their patron; and their intrepid courage did not long expect a</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      favorable moment. Whilst Valentinian amused himself, in the field</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      of Mars, with the spectacle of some military sports, they</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons, despatched the</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      guilty Heraclius, and stabbed the emperor to the heart, without</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      the least opposition from his numerous train, who seemed to</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      rejoice in the tyrant’s death. Such was the fate of Valentinian</a>

<a id='line_1756'>      spirit and ability. Valentinian was less excusable, since he had</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      passions, without virtues: even his religion was questionable;</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      and though he never deviated into the paths of heresy, he</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      scandalized the pious Christians by his attachment to the profane</a>

<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>      As early as the time of Cicero and Varro, it was the opinion of</a>

<a id='line_1775'>      period of his city. 75 This prophecy, disregarded perhaps in the</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      season of health and prosperity, inspired the people with gloomy</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      apprehensions, when the twelfth century, clouded with disgrace</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      and misfortune, was almost elapsed; 76 and even posterity must</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      acknowledge with some surprise, that the arbitrary interpretation</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      of an accidental or fabulous circumstance has been seriously</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      verified in the downfall of the Western empire. But its fall was</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures: the</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      Roman government appeared every day less formidable to its</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      enemies, more odious and oppressive to its subjects. 77 The taxes</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      were multiplied with the public distress; economy was neglected</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      in proportion as it became necessary; and the injustice of the</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people,</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      whom they defrauded of the indulgences that might sometimes have</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      alleviated their misery. The severe inquisition which confiscated</a>

<a id='line_1791'>      of Valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      Barbarians, to fly to the woods and mountains, or to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      vile and abject condition of mercenary servants. They abjured and</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      abhorred the name of Roman citizens, which had formerly excited</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      the ambition of mankind. The Armorican provinces of Gaul, and the</a>
