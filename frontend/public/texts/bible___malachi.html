<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou</a>
<a id='line_6'>loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved</a>
<a id='line_7'>Jacob, 1:3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage</a>
<a id='line_8'>waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and</a>
<a id='line_11'>build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall</a>
<a id='line_12'>build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of</a>
<a id='line_13'>wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for</a>
<a id='line_14'>ever.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be</a>
<a id='line_17'>magnified from the border of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be</a>
<a id='line_20'>a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my</a>
<a id='line_21'>fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my</a>
<a id='line_22'>name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?  1:7 Ye offer</a>
<a id='line_23'>polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted</a>
<a id='line_24'>thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye</a>
<a id='line_27'>offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy</a>
<a id='line_28'>governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith</a>
<a id='line_29'>the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:</a>
<a id='line_32'>this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the</a>
<a id='line_33'>LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:10 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?</a>
<a id='line_36'>neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure</a>
<a id='line_37'>in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at</a>
<a id='line_38'>your hand.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the</a>
<a id='line_41'>same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place</a>
<a id='line_42'>incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my</a>
<a id='line_43'>name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:12 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is</a>
<a id='line_46'>polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed</a>
<a id='line_49'>at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn,</a>
<a id='line_50'>and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I</a>
<a id='line_51'>accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:14 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and</a>
<a id='line_54'>voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a</a>
<a id='line_55'>great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the</a>
<a id='line_56'>heathen.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>2:1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>2:2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give</a>
<a id='line_61'>glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse</a>
<a id='line_62'>upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them</a>
<a id='line_63'>already, because ye do not lay it to heart.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>2:3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,</a>
<a id='line_66'>even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with</a>
<a id='line_67'>it.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that</a>
<a id='line_70'>my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him</a>
<a id='line_73'>for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in</a>
<a id='line_76'>his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many</a>
<a id='line_77'>away from iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:7 For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek</a>
<a id='line_80'>the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble</a>
<a id='line_83'>at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_84'>hosts.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all</a>
<a id='line_87'>the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been</a>
<a id='line_88'>partial in the law.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do</a>
<a id='line_91'>we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the</a>
<a id='line_92'>covenant of our fathers?  2:11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an</a>
<a id='line_93'>abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath</a>
<a id='line_94'>profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the</a>
<a id='line_95'>daughter of a strange god.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>2:12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the</a>
<a id='line_98'>scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an</a>
<a id='line_99'>offering unto the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with</a>
<a id='line_102'>tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth</a>
<a id='line_103'>not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your</a>
<a id='line_104'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between</a>
<a id='line_107'>thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt</a>
<a id='line_108'>treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.</a>
<a id='line_111'>And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take</a>
<a id='line_112'>heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife</a>
<a id='line_113'>of his youth.</a>
<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>2:16 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting</a>
<a id='line_116'>away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_117'>hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not</a>
<a id='line_118'>treacherously.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>2:17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein</a>
<a id='line_121'>have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in</a>
<a id='line_122'>the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God</a>
<a id='line_123'>of judgment?  3:1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall</a>
<a id='line_124'>prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly</a>
<a id='line_125'>come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye</a>
<a id='line_126'>delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when</a>
<a id='line_129'>he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:</a>
<a id='line_130'>3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall</a>
<a id='line_131'>purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they</a>
<a id='line_132'>may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>3:4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto</a>
<a id='line_135'>the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>3:5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift</a>
<a id='line_138'>witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against</a>
<a id='line_139'>false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his</a>
<a id='line_140'>wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger</a>
<a id='line_141'>from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>3:6 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are</a>
<a id='line_144'>not consumed.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>3:7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine</a>
<a id='line_147'>ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return</a>
<a id='line_148'>unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we</a>
<a id='line_149'>return?  3:8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say,</a>
<a id='line_150'>Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole</a>
<a id='line_153'>nation.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be</a>
<a id='line_156'>meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_157'>hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out</a>
<a id='line_158'>a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>3:11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not</a>
<a id='line_161'>destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her</a>
<a id='line_162'>fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>3:12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a</a>
<a id='line_165'>delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>3:13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye</a>
<a id='line_168'>say, What have we spoken so much against thee?  3:14 Ye have said, It</a>
<a id='line_169'>is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his</a>
<a id='line_170'>ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_171'>hosts?  3:15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work</a>
<a id='line_172'>wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>3:16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and</a>
<a id='line_175'>the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was</a>
<a id='line_176'>written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought</a>
<a id='line_177'>upon his name.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>3:17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when</a>
<a id='line_180'>I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own</a>
<a id='line_181'>son that serveth him.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>3:18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the</a>
<a id='line_184'>wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all</a>
<a id='line_187'>the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the</a>
<a id='line_188'>day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it</a>
<a id='line_189'>shall leave them neither root nor branch.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness</a>
<a id='line_192'>arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as</a>
<a id='line_193'>calves of the stall.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under</a>
<a id='line_196'>the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD</a>
<a id='line_197'>of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>4:4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto</a>
<a id='line_200'>him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>4:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of</a>
<a id='line_203'>the great and dreadful day of the LORD: 4:6 And he shall turn the</a>
<a id='line_204'>heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to</a>
<a id='line_205'>their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</a>
