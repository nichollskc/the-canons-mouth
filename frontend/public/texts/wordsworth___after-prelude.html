<a id='line_272'>Mr. Rawnsley, formerly of Wray Vicarage--now Canon Rawnsley of</a>
<a id='line_273'>Crosthwaite Vicarage, Keswick--sent me the following letter in reference</a>
<a id='line_274'>to:</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>  ... that unruly child of mountain birth,</a>
<a id='line_278'>  The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed</a>
<a id='line_279'>  Within our garden, found himself at once,</a>
<a id='line_280'>  As if by trick insidious and unkind,</a>
<a id='line_281'>  Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down</a>
<a id='line_282'>   ...</a>
<a id='line_283'>  I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,</a>
<a id='line_284'>   ...</a>
<a id='line_285'>  'Ha,' quoth I, 'pretty prisoner, are you there!'</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>  "I was not quite content with Dr. Cradock's identification of this</a>
<a id='line_289'>  brook, or of the garden; partly because, beyond the present garden</a>
<a id='line_290'>  square I found, on going up the brook, other garden squares, which</a>
<a id='line_291'>  were much more likely to have been the garden belonging to Anne</a>
<a id='line_292'>  Tyson's cottage, and because in these garden plots the stream was not</a>
<a id='line_293'>  'stripped of his voice,' by the covering of Coniston flags, as is the</a>
<a id='line_294'>  case lower down towards the market place; and partly because--as you</a>
<a id='line_295'>  notice--you can both hear and see the stream through the interstices</a>
<a id='line_296'>  of the flags, and that it can hardly be described (by one who will</a>
<a id='line_297'>  listen) as stripped of its voice.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>  At the same time I was bound to admit that in comparing the voice of</a>
<a id='line_300'>  the stream here in the 'channel paved by man's officious care' with</a>
<a id='line_301'>  the sound of it up in the fields beyond the vicarage, nearer its</a>
<a id='line_302'>  birth-place, it certainly might be said to be softer voiced; and as</a>
<a id='line_303'>  the poet speaks of it as 'that unruly child of mountain birth,' it</a>
<a id='line_304'>  looks as if he too had realised the difference.</a>
<a id='line_305'></a>
<a id='line_306'>  But whilst I thought that the identification of Dr. Cradock and</a>
<a id='line_307'>  yourself was very happy (in absence of other possibilities), I had not</a>
<a id='line_308'>  thought that Wordsworth would describe the stream as 'dimpling down,'</a>
<a id='line_309'>  or address it as a 'pretty prisoner.' A smaller stream seemed</a>
<a id='line_310'>  necessary.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>  It was, therefore, not a little curious that, in poking about among</a>
<a id='line_313'>  the garden plots on the west bank of the stream, fronting (as nearly</a>
<a id='line_314'>  as I could judge) Anne Tyson's cottage, to seek for remains of the ash</a>
<a id='line_315'>  tree, in which so often the poet--as he lay awake on summer</a>
<a id='line_316'>  nights--had watched 'the moon in splendour couched among the leaves,'</a>
<a id='line_317'>  rocking 'with every impulse of the breeze,' I not only stumbled upon</a>
<a id='line_318'>  the remains of an ash tree--now a 'pollard'--which is evidently</a>
<a id='line_319'>  sprung from a larger tree since decayed (and which for all I know may</a>
<a id='line_320'>  be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself); but also had</a>
<a id='line_321'>  the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain Isaac Hodgson,</a>
<a id='line_322'>  who volunteered the following information.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>  First, that Wordsworth, it was commonly said, had lodged part of his</a>
<a id='line_325'>  time with one Betty Braithwaite, in the very house called Church Hill</a>
<a id='line_326'>  House.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>  She was a widow, and kept a confectionery shop, and 'did a deal of</a>
<a id='line_329'>  baking,' he believed.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>  Secondly, that there was a little patch of garden at the back of the</a>
<a id='line_332'>  house, with a famous spring well--still called Old Betty's Well--in</a>
<a id='line_333'>  it, and that only a few paces from where I was then standing by the</a>
<a id='line_334'>  pollard ash.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>  On jumping over the fence I found myself on the western side of the</a>
<a id='line_337'>  quaint old Church Hill House, with magnificent views of the whole of</a>
<a id='line_338'>  the western side of Hawkshead Vale; grassy swell and wooded rises</a>
<a id='line_339'>  taking the eye up to the moorland ridge between us and Coniston.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>  'But,' said I, 'what about Betty's Well.' 'Oh,' said my friend,</a>
<a id='line_342'>  'that's a noted spring, that never freezes, and always runs; we all</a>
<a id='line_343'>  drink of it, and neighbours send to it. Here it is,' he continued;</a>
<a id='line_344'>  and, gazing down, I saw a little dripping well of water, lustrous,</a>
<a id='line_345'>  clear, coming evidently in continuous force from the springs or secret</a>
<a id='line_346'>  channels up hill, pausing for a moment at the trough, thence falling</a>
<a id='line_347'>  into a box or 'channel paved by man's officious care,' and in a moment</a>
<a id='line_348'>  out of sight and soundless, to pursue its way, 'stripped of its</a>
<a id='line_349'>  voice,' towards the main Town beck, that ran at the north-east border</a>
<a id='line_350'>  of the garden plot. 'Ha, pretty prisoner,' and the words 'dimple down'</a>
<a id='line_351'>  came to my mind at once as appropriate. 'Old Betty's Well gave the</a>
<a id='line_352'>  key-note of the 'famous brook'; and 'boxed within our garden' seemed</a>

<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>  was there none. Not so, however, the Ash tree, the remains of which I</a>

<a id='line_367'>  'In old times,' said my friend, 'the wall fence ran across the garden,</a>

<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>  were known the better, and loved the more on that account. Certainly,</a>
<a id='line_375'>  thought I to myself, here is the famous spring; a brook that</a>
<a id='line_376'>  Wordsworth must have known, and that may have been the centre of</a>
<a id='line_377'>  memory to him in his description of those early Hawkshead days, with</a>
<a id='line_378'>  its metaphor of fountain life.</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>  May we not, as we gaze on this little fountain well, in a garden plot</a>

<a id='line_384'>    'This portion of the river of his mind</a>

<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>  Is it not possible that the old dame whose</a>

<a id='line_389'>    'Clear though shallow stream of piety,</a>
<a id='line_390'>    Ran on the Sabbath days a fresher course,'</a>

<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>The following additional extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley's</a>
<a id='line_396'>(Christmas, 1882) casts light, both on the Hawkshead beck and fountain,</a>
<a id='line_397'>and on the stone seat in the market square, referred to in the fourth</a>
<a id='line_398'>book of 'The Prelude'.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>  "Postlethwaite of the Sun Inn at Hawkshead, has a father aged 82, who</a>
<a id='line_401'>  can remember that there was a _stone_ bench, not called old Betty's,</a>
<a id='line_402'>  but Old Jane's Stone, on which she used to spread nuts and cakes for</a>
<a id='line_403'>  the scholars of the Grammar School, but that it did not stand where</a>
<a id='line_404'>  the Market Hall now is, and no one ever remembers a stone or</a>
<a id='line_405'>  stone-bench standing there. This stone or stone-bench stood about</a>
<a id='line_406'>  opposite the Red Lion inn, in front of the little row of houses that</a>
<a id='line_407'>  run east and west, just as you pass out of the village in a northerly</a>
<a id='line_408'>  direction by the Red Lion. This stone or stone-bench is not associated</a>
<a id='line_409'>  with dark pine trees, but they may have passed away root and branch in</a>
<a id='line_410'>  an earlier generation.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>  Next and most interesting, I think, as showing that I was right in the</a>
<a id='line_413'>  matter of the _famous fountain,_ or spring in the garden, behind Betty</a>
<a id='line_414'>  Braithwaite's house. There exists in Hawkshead near this house a</a>
<a id='line_415'>  covered-in place or shed, to which all the village repair for their</a>
<a id='line_416'>  drinking-water, and always have done so. It is known by the name of</a>
<a id='line_417'>  the Spout House, and the water--which flows all the year from a</a>
<a id='line_418'>  longish spout, with an overflow one by its side--comes direct from the</a>
<a id='line_419'>  little drop well in Betty B.'s garden, after having its voice stripped</a>
<a id='line_420'>  and boxed therein; and, falling out of the spout into a deep stone</a>
<a id='line_421'>  basin and culvert, runs through the town to join the Town Beck.</a>
<a id='line_422'></a>
<a id='line_423'>  So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this, their familiar fountainhead,</a>
<a id='line_424'>  that though water is supplied in stand-pipes now from a Reservoir, the</a>
<a id='line_425'>  folks won't have it, and come here to this spout-house, bucket and jug</a>
<a id='line_426'>  in hand, morn, noon and night. I have never seen anything so like a</a>
<a id='line_427'>  continental scene at the gathering at Hawkshead spout-house.</a>
<a id='line_428'></a>
<a id='line_429'>  Lastly, there is a very aged thorn-tree in the churchyard--blown over</a>
<a id='line_430'>  but propped up--in which the forefathers of the hamlet used to sit as</a>
<a id='line_431'>  boys (in the thorn, that is, not the churchyard), and which has been</a>
<a id='line_432'>  worn smooth by many Hawkshead generations. The tradition is, that</a>
<a id='line_433'>  _Wordsworth used to sit a deal in it when at school._"</a>

<a id='line_448'></a>

<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>If the farm-house where Wordsworth spent the evening before this</a>
<a id='line_454'>memorable morning walk was either at Elterwater or High Arnside, and the</a>
<a id='line_455'>homeward pathway led across the ridge of Ironkeld, either by the old</a>
<a id='line_456'>mountain road (now almost disused), or over the pathless fells, there</a>
<a id='line_457'>are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in the</a>
<a id='line_458'>distance. The one is from the heights looking down to the Duddon</a>
<a id='line_459'>estuary, across the Coniston valley; the other is from a spot nearer</a>
<a id='line_460'>Hawkshead, where Morecambe Bay is visible. In the former case "the</a>
<a id='line_461'>meadows and the lower grounds" would be those in Yewdale; in the latter</a>
<a id='line_462'>case, they would be those between Latterbarrow and Hawkshead; and, on</a>
<a id='line_463'>either alternative, the "solid mountains" would be those of the Coniston</a>
<a id='line_464'>group--the Old Man and Wetherlam. It is also possible that the course of</a>
<a id='line_465'>the walk was over the Latterbarrow fells, or heights of Colthouse; but,</a>
<a id='line_466'>from the reference to the sunrise "not unseen" from the copse and field,</a>
<a id='line_467'>through which the "homeward pathway wound," it may be supposed that the</a>
<a id='line_468'>course was south-east, and therefore not over these fells, when his back</a>
<a id='line_469'>would have been to the sun. Dr. Cradock's note [Footnote T to book iv]</a>
<a id='line_470'>to the text (p. 197) sums up all that can "be safely said"; but Mr.</a>
<a id='line_471'>Rawnsley has supplied me with the following interesting remarks:</a>
<a id='line_472'></a>
<a id='line_473'>  "After a careful reading of the passage describing the poet's return</a>
<a id='line_474'>  from a festal night, spent in some farm-house beyond the hills, I am</a>
<a id='line_475'>  quite unable to say that the path from High Arnside over the Ironkeld</a>
<a id='line_476'>  range entirely suits the description. Is it not possible that the lad</a>
<a id='line_477'>  had school-fellows whose parents lived in Yewdale? If he had, and was</a>
<a id='line_478'>  returning from the party in one of the Yewdale farms, he would, as he</a>
<a id='line_479'>  ascended towards Tarn Howes, and faced about south, to gain the main</a>
<a id='line_480'>  Coniston road, by traversing the meadows between Berwick ground and</a>
<a id='line_481'>  the top of the Hawkshead and Coniston Hill, command a view of the sea</a>
<a id='line_482'>  that 'lay laughing at a distance'; and 'near, the solid</a>
<a id='line_483'>  mountains'--Wetherlam and Coniston Old Man--would shine 'bright as the</a>
<a id='line_484'>  clouds.' I think this is likely to have been the poet's track, because</a>
<a id='line_485'>  he speaks of labourers going forth to till the fields; and the Yewdale</a>
<a id='line_486'>  valley is one that is (at its head) chiefly arable, so that he would</a>
<a id='line_487'>  be likelier to have gazed on them there than in the vale of Hawkshead</a>
<a id='line_488'>  itself. One is here, however--as in a former passage, when we fixed on</a>
<a id='line_489'>  Yewdale as the one described as being a 'cultured vale'--obliged to</a>
<a id='line_490'>  remember that in Wordsworth's boyhood wheat was grown more extensively</a>
<a id='line_491'>  than is now the case in these parts. Of course, the Furness Fell,</a>
<a id='line_492'>  above Colthouse, might have been the scene. It is eminently suited to</a>
<a id='line_493'>  the description."</a>

<a id='line_514'>The following is an extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth's to</a>
<a id='line_515'>Lady Beaumont at Coleorton, dated "14th August," probably in 1808:</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'></a>
<a id='line_518'>  "We reached Cambridge at half-past nine. In our way to the Inn we</a>
<a id='line_519'>  stopped at the gate of St. John's College to set down one of our</a>
<a id='line_520'>  passengers. The stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy</a>
<a id='line_521'>  musing, and I was awe-stricken with the solemnity of the old gateway,</a>
<a id='line_522'>  and the light from a great distance within streaming along the</a>
<a id='line_523'>  pavement. When they told me it was the entrance to 'St. John's'</a>
<a id='line_524'>  College, I was still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight</a>
<a id='line_525'>  before me, for I thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days</a>
<a id='line_526'>  passing through that gateway to his home, and I could have believed</a>
<a id='line_527'>  that I saw him there even then, as I had seen him in the first year of</a>
<a id='line_528'>  his residence. I met with Mr. Clarkson at the Inn, and was, you may</a>
<a id='line_529'>  believe, rejoiced to hear his voice at the coach door. We supped</a>
<a id='line_530'>  together, and immediately after supper I went to bed, and slept well,</a>
<a id='line_531'>  and at 8 o'clock next morning went to Trinity Chapel. There I stood</a>
<a id='line_532'>  for many minutes in silence before the statue of Newton, while the</a>
<a id='line_533'>  organ sounded. I never saw a statue that gave me one hundredth part so</a>
<a id='line_534'>  much pleasure--but pleasure, that is not the word, it is a sublime</a>
<a id='line_535'>  sensation--in harmony with sentiments of devotion to the Divine Being,</a>
<a id='line_536'>  and reverence for the holy places where He is worshipped. We walked in</a>
<a id='line_537'>  the groves all the morning and visited the Colleges. I sought out a</a>
<a id='line_538'>  favourite ash tree which my brother speaks of in his poem on his own</a>
<a id='line_539'>  life--a tree covered with ivy. We dined with a fellow of Peter-House</a>
<a id='line_540'>  in his rooms, and after dinner I went to King's College Chapel. There,</a>
<a id='line_541'>  and everywhere else at Cambridge, I was even much more impressed with</a>
<a id='line_542'>  the effect of the buildings than I had been formerly, and I do believe</a>
<a id='line_543'>  that this power of receiving an enlarged enjoyment from the sight of</a>
<a id='line_544'>  buildings is one of the privileges of our later years. I have this</a>

<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>The following extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley's casts important</a>
<a id='line_566'>light on a difficult question of localization. Dr. Cradock is inclined</a>
<a id='line_567'>now to select the Outgate Crag, the second of the four places referred</a>
<a id='line_568'>to by Mr. Rawnsley. But the first may have been the place, and the</a>
<a id='line_569'>extract which follows will show how much is yet to be done in this</a>
<a id='line_570'>matter of localizing poetical allusions.</a>
<a id='line_571'></a>
<a id='line_572'>  "As to</a>
<a id='line_573'></a>
<a id='line_574'>                                'the crag,</a>
<a id='line_575'>    That, from the meeting-point of two highways</a>
<a id='line_576'>    Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched,'</a>
<a id='line_577'></a>
<a id='line_578'>  there seems to be no doubt but that we have four competitors for the</a>
<a id='line_579'>  honour of being the place to which the poet:</a>
<a id='line_580'></a>
<a id='line_581'>                  'impatient for the sight</a>
<a id='line_582'>    Of those led palfreys that should bear them home'</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>  repaired with his brothers</a>
<a id='line_585'></a>
<a id='line_586'>                       'one Christmas-time,</a>
<a id='line_587'>    On the glad eve of its dear holidays.'</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>  And unless, as it seems is quite possible, from what one sees in other</a>
<a id='line_590'>  of Wordsworth's poems, he really stood on one of the crags, and then</a>
<a id='line_591'>  in his description drew the picture of the landscape at his feet from</a>
<a id='line_592'>  his memory of what it was as seen from another of the vantage places,</a>
<a id='line_593'>  we need a high crag, rising gradually or abruptly from the actual</a>
<a id='line_594'>  meeting-place of two highways, with, if possible at this distance of</a>
<a id='line_595'>  time, a wall--or traces of it--quite at its summit. (I may mention</a>
<a id='line_596'>  that the wallers in this country still give two hundred years as the</a>
<a id='line_597'>  length of time that a dry wall will stand.) We need also traces of an</a>
<a id='line_598'>  old thorn tree close by. The wall, too, must be so placed on the</a>
<a id='line_599'>  summit of the crag that, as it faces the direction in which the lad is</a>
<a id='line_600'>  looking for his palfrey, it shall afford shelter to him against</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>                  'the sleety rain,</a>
<a id='line_603'>    And all the business of the elements.'</a>
<a id='line_604'></a>
<a id='line_605'>  It is evident that the lad would be looking out in a north-easterly</a>
<a id='line_606'>  direction, i. e. towards the head of Windermere and Ambleside. So that</a>
<a id='line_607'></a>
<a id='line_608'>                       'the mist,</a>
<a id='line_609'>    That on the line of each of those two roads</a>
<a id='line_610'>    Advanced in such indisputable shapes,'</a>
<a id='line_611'></a>
<a id='line_612'>  was urged by a wind that found the poet at his look-out station, glad</a>
<a id='line_613'>  to have the wall between him and it. Further, there must be in close</a>
<a id='line_614'>  proximity wood and the sound of rushing water, or the lapping of a</a>
<a id='line_615'>  lake wind-driven against the marge, for the boy remembers that 'the</a>
<a id='line_616'>  bleak music from that old stone wall' was mingled with 'the noise of</a>
<a id='line_617'>  wood and water.' The roads spoken of must be two highways, and must be</a>
<a id='line_618'>  capable of being seen for some distance; unless, as it is just</a>
<a id='line_619'>  possible, the epithet 'far-stretched' may be taken as applying not so</a>
<a id='line_620'>  much to the roads, as to the gradual ascent of the crag from the</a>
<a id='line_621'>  meeting-place of the two highways.</a>
<a id='line_622'></a>
<a id='line_623'>  The scene from the crag must be extended, and half plain half</a>
<a id='line_624'>  wood-land; at least one gathers as much from the lines:</a>
<a id='line_625'></a>
<a id='line_626'>                  'as the mist</a>
<a id='line_627'>    Gave intermitting prospect of the copse</a>
<a id='line_628'>    And plain beneath.'</a>
<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>  Lastly, it was a day of driving sleet and mist, and this of itself</a>
<a id='line_631'>  would necessitate that the poet and his brothers should only go to the</a>
<a id='line_632'>  place close to which the ponies must pass, or from which most plainly</a>
<a id='line_633'>  the roads were visible.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>  The boys too were</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>            'feverish, and tired, and restless,'</a>
<a id='line_638'></a>
<a id='line_639'>  and a schoolboy, to gain his point on such a day and on such an</a>
<a id='line_640'>  errand, does not take much account of a mile of country to be</a>
<a id='line_641'>  travelled over.</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>  So that it is immaterial, I think, to make the distance from Hawkshead</a>
<a id='line_644'>  of either of the four crags or vantage grounds a factor in decision.</a>
<a id='line_645'></a>
<a id='line_646'>  The farther the lads were from home when they met their ponies, the</a>
<a id='line_647'>  longer ride back they would have, and this to schoolboys is matter of</a>
<a id='line_648'>  consideration at such times.</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>  Taking then a survey of the ground of choice, we have to decide</a>
<a id='line_651'>  whether the crag in question is situated at the first division or main</a>
<a id='line_652'>  split of the road from Ambleside furthest from Hawkshead, or whether</a>
<a id='line_653'>  at the place where the two roads converge again into one nearer</a>
<a id='line_654'>  Hawkshead.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>  Whether, that is, the crag above the Pullwyke quarry, at the junction</a>
<a id='line_657'>  of the road to Water Barngates and the road to Wray and Outgate is to</a>
<a id='line_658'>  be selected, about two miles from Hawkshead; or whether we are to fix</a>
<a id='line_659'>  on the spot you have chosen, at the point about a mile north-east of</a>
<a id='line_660'>  Hawkshead, 'called in the ordnance map Outgate.'</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>  Of the two I incline to the former, for these reasons. The boys could</a>
<a id='line_663'>  not be so certain of 'not missing the ponies', at any other place than</a>
<a id='line_664'>  here at Pullwyke.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>  The crag exactly answers the poet's description, a rising ground, the</a>
<a id='line_667'>  meeting-place of two highways. For in the poet's time the old</a>
<a id='line_668'>  Hawkshead and Outgate road at the Pullwyke corner ran at the very foot</a>
<a id='line_669'>  of the rising ground (roughly speaking) parallel to and some 60 to 100</a>
<a id='line_670'>  yards west of the present road from the Pull to Wray.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>  It is true that no trace of wall is visible at its summit, but the</a>
<a id='line_673'>  summit has been planted since with trees, and walls are often removed</a>
<a id='line_674'>  at time of planting.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>  The poet would have a full view of the main road, down to, and round,</a>
<a id='line_677'>  the Pullwyke Bay; he would see the branch road from the fork, as it</a>
<a id='line_678'>  mounted the Water Barngates Hill, to the west, and would see the other</a>
<a id='line_679'>  road of the fork far-stretched and going south.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>  He would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land. He</a>
<a id='line_682'>  might, if the wind were south-easterly, hear the noise of Windermere,</a>
<a id='line_683'>  sobbing in the Pullwyke Bay, and would without doubt hear also the</a>
<a id='line_684'>  roar of the Pull Beck water, as it passed down from the Ironkeld</a>
<a id='line_685'>  slopes on his left towards the lake.</a>
<a id='line_686'></a>
<a id='line_687'>  It might be objected that the poem gives us the idea of a crag which,</a>
<a id='line_688'>  from the Hawkshead side at any rate, would require to be of more</a>
<a id='line_689'>  difficult ascent than this is, to justify the idea of difficulty as</a>
<a id='line_690'>  suggested in the lines:</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>                'thither I repaired,</a>
<a id='line_693'>    Scout-like, and gained the summit;'</a>
<a id='line_694'></a>
<a id='line_695'>  but I do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy</a>
<a id='line_696'>  felt--as he scanned the country with his eyes, on the 'qui vive' at</a>
<a id='line_697'>  every rise in the ground--the feelings of a scout, who questions</a>
<a id='line_698'>  constantly the distant prospect.</a>
<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>  And certainly the Pullwyke quarry crag rises most steeply from the</a>
<a id='line_701'>  meeting-point of the two highways.</a>
<a id='line_702'></a>
<a id='line_703'>  Next as to the Outgate crag, which you have chosen. I am out of love</a>
<a id='line_704'>  with it. First, if the lads wanted to make sure of the ponies, they</a>
<a id='line_705'>  would not have ascended it, but would have stayed just at the</a>
<a id='line_706'>  Hawkshead side of Outgate, or at the village itself, at the point of</a>
<a id='line_707'>  convergence of the ways.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>  Secondly, the crag can hardly be described as rising from the</a>
<a id='line_710'>  meeting-point of two highways; only one highway passes near it.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>  The crag is of so curious a formation geologically, that I can't fancy</a>
<a id='line_713'>  the poet describing his memory of it, without calling it a terraced</a>
<a id='line_714'>  hill, or an ascent by natural terraces.</a>
<a id='line_715'></a>
<a id='line_716'>  Then, again, the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it. The</a>
<a id='line_717'>  stream not near enough, or rather not of size enough, to be heard.</a>
<a id='line_718'>  Blelham Tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound, it is</a>
<a id='line_719'>  true, but the wind we suppose to have been north-east, and the sound</a>
<a id='line_720'>  of the Blelham Tarn would be much carried away from him.</a>
<a id='line_721'></a>
<a id='line_722'>  The present stone wall is not near the summit, and is of comparatively</a>
<a id='line_723'>  recent date. It is difficult to believe from the slope of the outcrop</a>
<a id='line_724'>  of rock that a wall could ever have been at the summit.</a>
<a id='line_725'></a>
<a id='line_726'>  But there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those</a>
<a id='line_727'>  extremes, both of which were probably in the mind and memory of the</a>
<a id='line_728'>  poet as he described the scene, and</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>    'The intermitting prospect of the copse.</a>
<a id='line_731'>    And plain beneath,'</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>  allowed him by the mist. One of these is the High Crag, about</a>
<a id='line_734'>  three-quarters of a mile from the divergence or convergence of the two</a>
<a id='line_735'>  highways, which Dr. Cradock has selected.</a>
<a id='line_736'></a>
<a id='line_737'>  There can be no doubt that this is the crag 'par excellence' for a</a>
<a id='line_738'>  wide and extended look-out over all the country between Outgate and</a>
<a id='line_739'>  Ambleside. Close at its summit there remain aged thorn trees, but no</a>
<a id='line_740'>  trace of a wall.</a>
<a id='line_741'></a>
<a id='line_742'>  But High Crag can hardly be said to have risen at 'the meeting-point</a>
<a id='line_743'>  of two highways,' unless we are to understand the epithet</a>
<a id='line_744'>  'far-stretched' as applying to the south-western slopes or skirts of</a>
<a id='line_745'>  the hill; and the two highways, the roads between Water Barngates on</a>
<a id='line_746'>  the west, and the bridle road between Pullwyke and Outgate at their</a>
<a id='line_747'>  Outgate junction, and this is rather too far a stretch.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>  It is quite true that if bridle paths can be described as highways,</a>
<a id='line_750'>  there may be said to be a meeting-point of these close at the</a>
<a id='line_751'>  north-eastern side of the crag.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>  But, remembering that the ponies came from Penrith, the driver was not</a>
<a id='line_754'>  likely to have had any intimate knowledge of these bridle paths;</a>
<a id='line_755'>  while, at the same time, on that misty day, I much question whether</a>
<a id='line_756'>  the boys on the look-out at High Crag could have seen ponies creeping</a>
<a id='line_757'>  along between walled roads at so great a distance as half a mile or</a>
<a id='line_758'>  more.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>  And this would seem to have been the problem for them on that day.</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>  I ought in fairness to say that it is not likely that the roads were</a>
<a id='line_763'>  then (as to-day) walled up high on either side. To-day, even from the</a>
<a id='line_764'>  summit of High Crag, only the head and ears of a pony could be seen as</a>
<a id='line_765'>  it passed up the Water Barngates Road; but at the end of last century</a>
<a id='line_766'>  many of the roads were only partially walled off from the moorlands</a>
<a id='line_767'>  they passed over in the Lake Country.</a>
<a id='line_768'></a>
<a id='line_769'>  Still, as I said, High Crag was a point of vantage that the poet, as a</a>
<a id='line_770'>  lad, must have often climbed, in this part of the country, if he</a>
<a id='line_771'>  wanted to indulge in the delights of panoramic scene.</a>
<a id='line_772'></a>
<a id='line_773'>  There is a wall some hundred yards from the summit, on the</a>
<a id='line_774'>  south-westerly flank of High Crag; near this--at a point close by, two</a>
<a id='line_775'>  large holly trees--the boy might have sheltered himself against the</a>
<a id='line_776'>  north-eastern wind, and have got a closer and better view of the road</a>
<a id='line_777'>  between Barngates and Outgate, and Randy Pike and Outgate.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>  Here, too, he could possibly hear the sound of the stream in the</a>
<a id='line_780'>  dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet; but I am far from</a>
<a id='line_781'>  content with this as being the spot the poet watched from.</a>
<a id='line_782'></a>
<a id='line_783'>  There is again a fourth possible look-out place, to which you will</a>
<a id='line_784'>  remember I directed your attention, nearer Randy Pike. The slope,</a>
<a id='line_785'>  covered with larches, rises up from the Randy Pike Road to a</a>
<a id='line_786'>  precipitous crag which faces north and east.</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>  From this, a grand view of the country between Randy Pike and Pullwyke</a>
<a id='line_789'>  is obtained, and if the bridle paths might--as is possible, but</a>
<a id='line_790'>  unlikely--be called two highways, then this crag could be spoken of as</a>
<a id='line_791'>  rising from the meeting place of the two highways. For the old</a>
<a id='line_792'>  Hawkshead Road passed along to the east, within calling distance (say</a>
<a id='line_793'>  ninety yards), and a bridle road from Pullwyke, now used chiefly by</a>
<a id='line_794'>  the quarrymen, passed within eighty yards to the west; while it is</a>
<a id='line_795'>  certain that the brook below, when swollen by winter rains, might be</a>
<a id='line_796'>  loud enough to be heard from the copse. This crag is known as Coldwell</a>
<a id='line_797'>  or Caudwell Crag, and is situated about half a mile east-south-east of</a>
<a id='line_798'>  the High Crag.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>  It has this much in its favour, that a wall of considerable age crests</a>
<a id='line_801'>  its summit, and one can whilst sitting down on a rock close behind it</a>
<a id='line_802'>  be sheltered from the north and east, and yet obtain an extensive view</a>
<a id='line_803'>  of the subadjacent country. IF it were certain that the ponies when</a>
<a id='line_804'>  they got to Pullwyke did not go up towards Water Barngates, and so to</a>
<a id='line_805'>  Hawkshead, then there is no crag in the district which would so</a>
<a id='line_806'>  thoroughly answer to all the needs of the boys, and to all the points</a>
<a id='line_807'>  of description the poet has placed on record.</a>
<a id='line_808'></a>
<a id='line_809'>  But it is just this IF that makes me decide on the Pullwyke Crag--the</a>
<a id='line_810'>  one first described--as being the actual spot to which, scout-like,</a>
<a id='line_811'>  the schoolboys clomb, on that eventful 'eve of their dear holidays;'</a>
<a id='line_812'>  while, at the same time, it is my firm conviction that Wordsworth--as</a>
<a id='line_813'>  he painted the memories of that event--had also before his mind's eye</a>
<a id='line_814'>  the scene as viewed from Coldwell and High Crag."</a>

<a id='line_832'>The following is a copy of a version of these 'Lines', sent by Coleridge</a>
<a id='line_833'>to Sir George Beaumont, at Dunmow, Essex, in January, 1807. The</a>

<a id='line_835'>finally adopted (see p. 129), are interesting in many ways:</a>

<a id='line_851'>  What _may_ be told, by words revealable:</a>

<a id='line_853'>  Of vernal growth, oft quickening in the heart</a>
<a id='line_854'>  Thoughts, that obey no mastery of words,                        10</a>

<a id='line_1057'>NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY</a>
<a id='line_1058'></a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>(See pp. 297 and 302, 'The Prelude', book ix.)</a>
<a id='line_1061'></a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>Professor Emile Legouis of Lyons--a thorough student, and a very</a>
<a id='line_1064'>competent expounder, of our modern English Literature--supplied me, some</a>
<a id='line_1065'>years ago, with numerous facts in reference to Wordsworth's friend</a>
<a id='line_1066'>General Beaupuy, and his family, from which I extract the following:</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>  'The Prelude' gives us very little precise information about the</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  republican officer with whom Wordsworth became acquainted in France,</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  and on whom he bestowed more praise than on almost any other of his</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  contemporaries. We only gather the following facts:--That his name was</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  'Beaupuy', that he was quartered at Orleans, with royalist officers,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  sometime between November 1791 and the spring of 1792, and that</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>    'He perished fighting, _in supreme command_,</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    For liberty, against deluded men,</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    His fellow-countrymen....'</a>
<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>  Though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  data, the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  Wordsworth's statement, which, however, can be explained and redressed</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  without much difficulty.</a>
<a id='line_1084'></a>
<a id='line_1085'>  The first inaccuracy is in the spelling of the name, which is</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  'Beaupuy' and not 'Beaupuis'--a slight mistake considering that</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  Wordsworth was a foreigner, and, besides, wrote down his friend's name</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  ten years and perhaps more after losing sight of him. Moreover, the</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  name of the general who, I think, was meant by Wordsworth, I have</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  found spelt 'Beaupuy' in one instance, viz. the signature of a letter</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  of his, as printed in 'Vie et Correspondance de Merlin de Thionville',</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  publiée par Jean Reynaud, Paris, 1860 (2'e partie p. 241).</a>
<a id='line_1093'></a>
<a id='line_1094'>  The spelling of proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays,</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  and this irregularity is not to be wondered at.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>  The second inaccuracy consists in stating that General Beaupuy died on</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  the banks of the Loire during the Vendean war. Indeed, he was</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  grievously wounded at the Battle of Château-Gonthier, on the 26th of</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  October 1793, and reported as dead. His soldiers thought he had been</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  killed, and the rumour must have spread abroad, as it was recorded by</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  A. Thiers himself in his 'Histoire de la Révolution', and by A.</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  Challemel in his 'Histoire Musée de la République Française'.</a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>  It is no wonder that Wordsworth, who was then in England, and could</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  only read imperfect accounts of what took place in France, should have</a>
<a id='line_1107'>  been mistaken too.</a>
<a id='line_1108'></a>
<a id='line_1109'>  No other General Beaupuy is recorded in the history of the Revolution,</a>
<a id='line_1110'>  so far as I have been able to ascertain. The moral character of the</a>
<a id='line_1111'>  officer, whose life I shall relate, answers to Wordsworth's</a>
<a id='line_1112'>  description, and is worthy of his high estimate.</a>
<a id='line_1113'></a>
<a id='line_1114'>  Armand Michel de Bachelier, Chevalier de Beaupuy, was born at</a>
<a id='line_1115'>  Mussidan, in Perigord, on the 15th of July 1757. He belonged to a</a>
<a id='line_1116'>  noble family, less proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had</a>
<a id='line_1117'>  shed for France on many battlefields. On his mother's side (Mlle. de</a>
<a id='line_1118'>  Villars), he reckoned Montaigne, the celebrated essayist, among his</a>
<a id='line_1119'>  ancestors. His parents having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the</a>
<a id='line_1120'>  time, educated him according to their principles.</a>
<a id='line_1121'></a>
<a id='line_1122'>  He had four brothers, who were all destined to turn republicans and do</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  good service to the new cause, though their interest certainly lay in</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  the opposite direction.</a>
<a id='line_1125'></a>
<a id='line_1126'>  ...</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>  He was made sub-lieutenant in the regiment of Bassigny (33rd division</a>
<a id='line_1129'>  of foot) on the 2nd of March 1773, and lieutenant of grenadiers on the</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  1st of October of the same year.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>  In 1791 he was first lieutenant in the same regiment. Having sided</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  with the Revolution, he was appointed commander of a battalion of</a>
<a id='line_1134'>  national volunteers in the department of Dordogne. I have not found</a>
<a id='line_1135'>  the exact date of this appointment, but it must have taken place</a>
<a id='line_1136'>  immediately after his stay at Orléans with Wordsworth.</a>
<a id='line_1137'></a>
<a id='line_1138'>  I have found no further mention of his name till September 1792, when</a>
<a id='line_1139'>  he is known to have served in the "Armée du Rhin," under General</a>
<a id='line_1140'>  Custine, and contributed to the taking of Spire.</a>
<a id='line_1141'></a>
<a id='line_1142'>  He took an important part in the taking of Worms, 4th October; of</a>
<a id='line_1143'>  Mayence (Maenz) 21st October. He was among the garrison of Mayence</a>
<a id='line_1144'>  when this place was besieged by the Prussians, and obliged to</a>
<a id='line_1145'>  capitulate after a long and famous siege (from 6th April 1793 to 22nd</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  July 1793). [A]</a>
<a id='line_1147'></a>
<a id='line_1148'>  During the siege he wrote a journal of all the operations.</a>
<a id='line_1149'>  Unfortunately, this journal is very short, and purely military. It has</a>
<a id='line_1150'>  been handed down to us, and is found in the Bibliothèque Nationale of</a>
<a id='line_1151'>  Paris in the 'Papiers de Merlin de Thionville', n. acq. fr. Nos.</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  244-252, 8 vol. in-8°. Beaupuy's journal is in the 3rd volume, fol.</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  213-228.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>  ...</a>
<a id='line_1156'></a>
<a id='line_1157'>  In the Vendean war, the "Mayençais," or soldiers returned from</a>
<a id='line_1158'>  Mayence, made themselves conspicuous, and bore almost all the brunt of</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  the campaign. But none of them distinguished himself more than</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  Beaupuy, then a General of Brigade.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>  The Mayençais arrived in Vendée at the end of August or beginning of</a>
<a id='line_1163'>  September 1793. To Beaupuy's skill the victory of Chollet (Oct. 17,</a>
<a id='line_1164'>  1793) is attributed by Jomini. In this battle he fought hand to hand</a>
<a id='line_1165'>  with and overcame a Vendean cavalier. He himself had three horses</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  killed, and had a very narrow escape. On the battlefield he was made</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  'general of division' by the "Represéntants du peuple." It was after</a>
<a id='line_1168'>  Chollet that the Vendeans made the memorable crossing of the Loire at</a>
<a id='line_1169'>  St. Florent.</a>
<a id='line_1170'></a>
<a id='line_1171'>  At Laval and Château-Gonthier (Oct. 26) a terrible defeat was</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  inflicted on the Republicans, owing to the incapacity of their</a>
<a id='line_1173'>  commander-in-chief, Léchelle. The whole corps commanded by General</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  Beaupuy was crushed by a terrible fire, He himself, after withstanding</a>
<a id='line_1175'>  for two or three hours with 2000 or 3000 men all the attacks of the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  royalists, was disabled by a shot, and fell, crying out, "'Laissez-moi</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  là, et portez à mes grenadiers ma chemise sanglante'." His soldiers</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  thought he was dead, and then the error was spread, which was repeated</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  by Wordsworth, Thiers, and Challamel. Wordsworth's mistake is so far</a>
<a id='line_1180'>  interesting, as it seems to prove that very little or no</a>
<a id='line_1181'>  correspondence passed between the two friends after they had parted.</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  Beaupuy, moreover, had too much work upon his hands to give much of</a>
<a id='line_1183'>  his time to letter-writing.</a>
<a id='line_1184'></a>
<a id='line_1185'>  Though severely wounded, Beaupuy lived on, and less than six weeks</a>
<a id='line_1186'>  after the battle of Château-Gonthier, he was seen on the ramparts of</a>
<a id='line_1187'>  Angers, where he required himself to be carried to animate his</a>
<a id='line_1188'>  soldiers and head the defenders of the place, from which the Vendeans</a>
<a id='line_1189'>  were driven after a severe contest (Dec. 5 and 6).</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>  On the 22nd of December 1793 he shared in the victory of Savenay with</a>
<a id='line_1192'>  his celebrated friends, Marceau, Kleber, and Westermann. After this</a>
<a id='line_1193'>  battle, which put an end to the great Vendean war, he wrote the</a>
<a id='line_1194'>  following letter to his friend Merlin de Thionville, the celebrated</a>
<a id='line_1195'>  "représentant du peuple."</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>    "SAVENAY, le 4 Nivôse au 2'e (25 Dec. 73).</a>

<a id='line_1233'>    LE GÉNERAL DE BRIGADE BEAUPUY.</a>
<a id='line_1234'></a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>  I think I can recognize in this letter some traits of Beaupuy's</a>
<a id='line_1237'>  character as pointed out by Wordsworth, not excepting the</a>
<a id='line_1238'>  half-suppressed criticism:</a>
<a id='line_1239'></a>
<a id='line_1240'>      '... somewhat vain he was,</a>
<a id='line_1241'>    Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,</a>
<a id='line_1242'>    But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy</a>
<a id='line_1243'>    Diffused around him ...'</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>  Passing over numerous military incidents, on the 26th of June 1796</a>
<a id='line_1246'>  Beaupuy received seven or eight sabre-cuts at Jorich-Wildstadt. But on</a>
<a id='line_1247'>  the 8th of July he was already back at his post.</a>
<a id='line_1248'></a>
<a id='line_1249'>  He again greatly distinguished himself on the 1st of September 1796 at</a>
<a id='line_1250'>  Greisenfeld and Langenbruck, where the victory of the French was owing</a>
<a id='line_1251'>  to a timely attack made by Desaix and himself.</a>
<a id='line_1252'></a>
<a id='line_1253'>  He was one of the generals under Moreau when the latter achieved his</a>
<a id='line_1254'>  well-known retreat through the Black Forest, begun on the 15th of</a>
<a id='line_1255'>  September 1796, and during which many battles were fought. In one of</a>
<a id='line_1256'>  the actions on the banks of the Elz, Beaupuy was killed by a</a>
<a id='line_1257'>  cannon-ball, while opposing General Latour on the heights of</a>
<a id='line_1258'>  Malterdingen. His soldiers, who loved him passionately, fought</a>
<a id='line_1259'>  desperately to avenge his death (Oct. 19, 1796).</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>  One of Beaupuy's colleagues, General Duhem, in his account of the</a>
<a id='line_1262'>  battle to the Government, thus expressed himself on General Beaupuy:</a>

<a id='line_1271'>  Such bombastic style was then common, but what we have seen of Beaupuy</a>
<a id='line_1272'>  in this sketch shows that he had through his career united Nestor's</a>
<a id='line_1273'>  prudence [B] with Achilles' bodily courage and Bayard's chivalric</a>
<a id='line_1274'>  spirit,--to use the language of the time.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>  General Moreau had Beaupuy's remains transported to Brisach, where a</a>
<a id='line_1277'>  monument was erected to his memory in 1802, after the peace of</a>
<a id='line_1278'>  Lunéville.</a>
<a id='line_1279'></a>
<a id='line_1280'>  In short, Beaupuy seems to have always remained worthy of the high</a>
<a id='line_1281'>  praise bestowed on him by Wordsworth. His name is to be remembered</a>
<a id='line_1282'>  along with those of the unspotted generals of the first years of the</a>
<a id='line_1283'>  Revolution--Hoche, Marceau, etc.--before the craving for conquest had</a>
<a id='line_1284'>  developed, and the love of liberty yielded to a fond admiration of</a>
<a id='line_1285'>  Bonaparte as it did in the case of Kleber, Desaix, and so many others.</a>
<a id='line_1286'>  [C]</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>  N. B.--The great influence which Beaupuy exercised at that time on</a>
<a id='line_1289'>  Wordsworth will be easily understood, if we take into account not only</a>
<a id='line_1290'>  his real qualities, but also his age. When they met, Wordsworth was</a>
<a id='line_1291'>  only twenty-one, Beaupuy nearly thirty-five. The grown-up man could</a>
<a id='line_1292'>  impart much of his knowledge of life, and of the favourite authors of</a>
<a id='line_1293'>  the time, to a youth fresh from the University--though that youth was</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  Wordsworth.</a>
