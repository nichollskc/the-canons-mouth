<a id='line_128'>                                 Exeunt KING, QUEEN, and SUFFOLK</a>
<a id='line_129'>  GLOUCESTER. Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</a>
<a id='line_130'>    To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief</a>
<a id='line_131'>    Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</a>
<a id='line_132'>    What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,</a>
<a id='line_133'>    His valour, coin, and people, in the wars?</a>
<a id='line_134'>    Did he so often lodge in open field,</a>
<a id='line_135'>    In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,</a>
<a id='line_136'>    To conquer France, his true inheritance?</a>
<a id='line_137'>    And did my brother Bedford toil his wits</a>
<a id='line_138'>    To keep by policy what Henry got?</a>
<a id='line_139'>    Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</a>
<a id='line_140'>    Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</a>
<a id='line_141'>    Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy?</a>
<a id='line_142'>    Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</a>
<a id='line_143'>    With all the learned Council of the realm,</a>
<a id='line_144'>    Studied so long, sat in the Council House</a>
<a id='line_145'>    Early and late, debating to and fro</a>
<a id='line_146'>    How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe?</a>
<a id='line_147'>    And had his Highness in his infancy</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Crowned in Paris, in despite of foes?</a>
<a id='line_149'>    And shall these labours and these honours die?</a>
<a id='line_150'>    Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,</a>
<a id='line_151'>    Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?</a>
<a id='line_152'>    O peers of England, shameful is this league!</a>
<a id='line_153'>    Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</a>
<a id='line_154'>    Blotting your names from books of memory,</a>
<a id='line_155'>    Razing the characters of your renown,</a>
<a id='line_156'>    Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,</a>
<a id='line_157'>    Undoing all, as all had never been!</a>
<a id='line_158'>  CARDINAL. Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</a>
<a id='line_159'>    This peroration with such circumstance?</a>
<a id='line_160'>    For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.</a>
<a id='line_161'>  GLOUCESTER. Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can;</a>
<a id='line_162'>    But now it is impossible we should.</a>
<a id='line_163'>    Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</a>
<a id='line_164'>    Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</a>
<a id='line_165'>    Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</a>
<a id='line_166'>    Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</a>
<a id='line_167'>  SALISBURY. Now, by the death of Him that died for all,</a>
<a id='line_168'>    These counties were the keys of Normandy!</a>
<a id='line_169'>    But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</a>
<a id='line_170'>  WARWICK. For grief that they are past recovery;</a>
<a id='line_171'>    For were there hope to conquer them again</a>
<a id='line_172'>    My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</a>
<a id='line_173'>    Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;</a>
<a id='line_174'>    Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer;</a>
<a id='line_175'>    And are the cities that I got with wounds</a>
<a id='line_176'>    Deliver'd up again with peaceful words?</a>
<a id='line_177'>    Mort Dieu!</a>
<a id='line_178'>  YORK. For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,</a>
<a id='line_179'>    That dims the honour of this warlike isle!</a>
<a id='line_180'>    France should have torn and rent my very heart</a>
<a id='line_181'>    Before I would have yielded to this league.</a>
<a id='line_182'>    I never read but England's kings have had</a>
<a id='line_183'>    Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives;</a>
<a id='line_184'>    And our King Henry gives away his own</a>
<a id='line_185'>    To match with her that brings no vantages.</a>
<a id='line_186'>  GLOUCESTER. A proper jest, and never heard before,</a>
<a id='line_187'>    That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</a>
<a id='line_188'>    For costs and charges in transporting her!</a>
<a id='line_189'>    She should have stay'd in France, and starv'd in France,</a>
<a id='line_190'>    Before-</a>
<a id='line_191'>  CARDINAL. My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</a>
<a id='line_192'>    It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</a>
<a id='line_193'>  GLOUCESTER. My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;</a>
<a id='line_194'>    'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</a>
<a id='line_195'>    But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.</a>
<a id='line_196'>    Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face</a>
<a id='line_197'>    I see thy fury; if I longer stay</a>
<a id='line_198'>    We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</a>
<a id='line_199'>    Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,</a>
<a id='line_200'>    I prophesied France will be lost ere long.              Exit</a>
<a id='line_201'>  CARDINAL. So, there goes our Protector in a rage.</a>
<a id='line_202'>    'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;</a>
<a id='line_203'>    Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,</a>
<a id='line_204'>    And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.</a>
<a id='line_205'>    Consider, lords, he is the next of blood</a>
<a id='line_206'>    And heir apparent to the English crown.</a>
<a id='line_207'>    Had Henry got an empire by his marriage</a>
<a id='line_208'>    And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</a>
<a id='line_209'>    There's reason he should be displeas'd at it.</a>
<a id='line_210'>    Look to it, lords; let not his smoothing words</a>
<a id='line_211'>    Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.</a>
<a id='line_212'>    What though the common people favour him,</a>
<a id='line_213'>    Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,'</a>
<a id='line_214'>    Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice</a>
<a id='line_215'>    'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'</a>
<a id='line_216'>    With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'</a>
<a id='line_217'>    I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</a>
<a id='line_218'>    He will be found a dangerous Protector.</a>
<a id='line_219'>  BUCKINGHAM. Why should he then protect our sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_220'>    He being of age to govern of himself?</a>
<a id='line_221'>    Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</a>
<a id='line_222'>    And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</a>
<a id='line_223'>    We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</a>
<a id='line_224'>  CARDINAL. This weighty business will not brook delay;</a>
<a id='line_225'>    I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.                  Exit</a>
<a id='line_226'>  SOMERSET. Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride</a>
<a id='line_227'>    And greatness of his place be grief to us,</a>
<a id='line_228'>    Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal;</a>
<a id='line_229'>    His insolence is more intolerable</a>
<a id='line_230'>    Than all the princes in the land beside;</a>
<a id='line_231'>    If Gloucester be displac'd, he'll be Protector.</a>
<a id='line_232'>  BUCKINGHAM. Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,</a>
<a id='line_233'>    Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal.</a>
<a id='line_234'>                                  Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET</a>
<a id='line_235'>  SALISBURY. Pride went before, ambition follows him.</a>
<a id='line_236'>    While these do labour for their own preferment,</a>
<a id='line_237'>    Behoves it us to labour for the realm.</a>
<a id='line_238'>    I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</a>
<a id='line_239'>    Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_240'>    Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal-</a>
<a id='line_241'>    More like a soldier than a man o' th' church,</a>
<a id='line_242'>    As stout and proud as he were lord of all-</a>
<a id='line_243'>    Swear like a ruffian and demean himself</a>
<a id='line_244'>    Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.</a>
<a id='line_245'>    Warwick my son, the comfort of my age,</a>
<a id='line_246'>    Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy housekeeping,</a>
<a id='line_247'>    Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,</a>
<a id='line_248'>    Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.</a>
<a id='line_249'>    And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_250'>    In bringing them to civil discipline,</a>
<a id='line_251'>    Thy late exploits done in the heart of France</a>
<a id='line_252'>    When thou wert Regent for our sovereign,</a>
<a id='line_253'>    Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:</a>
<a id='line_254'>    Join we together for the public good,</a>
<a id='line_255'>    In what we can, to bridle and suppress</a>
<a id='line_256'>    The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal,</a>
<a id='line_257'>    With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;</a>
<a id='line_258'>    And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds</a>
<a id='line_259'>    While they do tend the profit of the land.</a>
<a id='line_260'>  WARWICK. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land</a>
<a id='line_261'>    And common profit of his country!</a>
<a id='line_262'>  YORK. And so says York- [Aside] for he hath greatest cause.</a>
<a id='line_263'>  SALISBURY. Then let's make haste away and look unto the main.</a>
<a id='line_264'>  WARWICK. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost-</a>
<a id='line_265'>    That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,</a>
<a id='line_266'>    And would have kept so long as breath did last.</a>
<a id='line_267'>    Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,</a>
<a id='line_268'>    Which I will win from France, or else be slain.</a>
<a id='line_269'>                                    Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY</a>
<a id='line_270'>  YORK. Anjou and Maine are given to the French;</a>
<a id='line_271'>    Paris is lost; the state of Normandy</a>
<a id='line_272'>    Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.</a>
<a id='line_273'>    Suffolk concluded on the articles;</a>
<a id='line_274'>    The peers agreed; and Henry was well pleas'd</a>
<a id='line_275'>    To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.</a>
<a id='line_276'>    I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?</a>
<a id='line_277'>    'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</a>
<a id='line_278'>    Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,</a>
<a id='line_279'>    And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,</a>
<a id='line_280'>    Still revelling like lords till all be gone;</a>
<a id='line_281'>    While as the silly owner of the goods</a>
<a id='line_282'>    Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands</a>
<a id='line_283'>    And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,</a>
<a id='line_284'>    While all is shar'd and all is borne away,</a>
<a id='line_285'>    Ready to starve and dare not touch his own.</a>
<a id='line_286'>    So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</a>
<a id='line_287'>    While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.</a>
<a id='line_288'>    Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_289'>    Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</a>
<a id='line_290'>    As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt</a>
<a id='line_291'>    Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.</a>
<a id='line_292'>    Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</a>
<a id='line_293'>    Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</a>
<a id='line_294'>    Even as I have of fertile England's soil.</a>
<a id='line_295'>    A day will come when York shall claim his own;</a>

<a id='line_901'>  SIMPCOX. O, born so, master!</a>
<a id='line_902'>  GLOUCESTER. What, and wouldst climb a tree?</a>
<a id='line_903'>  SIMPCOX. But that in all my life, when I was a youth.</a>
<a id='line_904'>  WIFE. Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.</a>
<a id='line_905'>  GLOUCESTER. Mass, thou lov'dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.</a>

<a id='line_907'>    And made me climb, With danger of my life.</a>
<a id='line_908'>  GLOUCESTER. A subtle knave! But yet it shall not serve:</a>

<a id='line_912'>  GLOUCESTER. Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?</a>
<a id='line_913'>  SIMPCOX. Red, master; red as blood.</a>
<a id='line_914'>  GLOUCESTER. Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?</a>
<a id='line_915'>  SIMPCOX. Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.</a>
<a id='line_916'>  KING HENRY. Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?</a>
<a id='line_917'>  SUFFOLK. And yet, I think, jet did he never see.</a>

<a id='line_1019'>Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK</a>
<a id='line_1020'></a>
<a id='line_1021'>  YORK. Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</a>
<a id='line_1022'>    Our simple supper ended, give me leave</a>
<a id='line_1023'>    In this close walk to satisfy myself</a>
<a id='line_1024'>    In craving your opinion of my tide,</a>
<a id='line_1025'>    Which is infallible, to England's crown.</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  SALISBURY. My lord, I long to hear it at full.</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  WARWICK. Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>    The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  YORK. Then thus:</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons;</a>
<a id='line_1031'>    The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</a>
<a id='line_1032'>    The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>    Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom</a>
<a id='line_1034'>    Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</a>
<a id='line_1035'>    The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</a>
<a id='line_1036'>    The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</a>
<a id='line_1038'>    Edward the Black Prince died before his father</a>
<a id='line_1039'>    And left behind him Richard, his only son,</a>
<a id='line_1040'>    Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king</a>
<a id='line_1041'>    Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_1042'>    The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</a>
<a id='line_1043'>    Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,</a>
<a id='line_1044'>    Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>    Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came.</a>
<a id='line_1046'>    And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>    Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  WARWICK. Father, the Duke hath told the truth;</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  YORK. Which now they hold by force, and not by right;</a>
<a id='line_1051'>    For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,</a>
<a id='line_1052'>    The issue of the next son should have reign'd.</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  SALISBURY. But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  YORK. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</a>
<a id='line_1055'>    I claim the crown, had issue Philippe, a daughter,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>    Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;</a>
<a id='line_1057'>    Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  SALISBURY. This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>    As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    Who kept him in captivity till he died.</a>
<a id='line_1063'>    But, to the rest.</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  YORK. His eldest sister, Anne,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    My mother, being heir unto the crown,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was</a>
<a id='line_1067'>    To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son, son.</a>
<a id='line_1068'>    By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</a>
<a id='line_1071'>    Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;</a>
<a id='line_1072'>    So, if the issue of the elder son</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    Succeed before the younger, I am King.</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  WARWICK. What plain proceedings is more plain than this?</a>
<a id='line_1075'>    Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</a>
<a id='line_1076'>    The fourth son: York claims it from the third.</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign.</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee</a>
<a id='line_1079'>    And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</a>
<a id='line_1080'>    Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    And in this private plot be we the first</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    That shall salute our rightful sovereign</a>
<a id='line_1083'>    With honour of his birthright to the crown.</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  BOTH. Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King!</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  YORK. We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    Till I be crown'd, and that my sword be stain'd</a>
<a id='line_1087'>    With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</a>
<a id='line_1088'>    And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    But with advice and silent secrecy.</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</a>
<a id='line_1091'>    Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,</a>
<a id='line_1092'>    At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,</a>
<a id='line_1095'>    That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey;</a>
<a id='line_1096'>    'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  SALISBURY. My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  WARWICK. My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</a>
<a id='line_1100'>    Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  YORK. And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,</a>

<a id='line_1438'>  KING HENRY. Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?</a>
<a id='line_1439'>  SOMERSET. That all your interest in those territories</a>

<a id='line_1441'>  KING HENRY. Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's will be done!</a>

<a id='line_1444'>    Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,</a>
<a id='line_1445'>    And caterpillars eat my leaves away;</a>

<a id='line_1461'>    Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?</a>
<a id='line_1462'>  YORK. 'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France</a>
<a id='line_1463'>    And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;</a>
<a id='line_1464'>    By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.</a>

<a id='line_1477'>  CARDINAL. It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</a>

<a id='line_1512'>    Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,</a>

<a id='line_1529'>    'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  CARDINAL. My liege, his railing is intolerable.</a>

<a id='line_1615'>    No; let him die, in that he is a fox,</a>

<a id='line_1728'>    Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</a>
<a id='line_1729'>    Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,</a>

<a id='line_1733'>    This devil here shall be my substitute;</a>
<a id='line_1734'>    For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>    In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.</a>
<a id='line_1736'>    By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,</a>
<a id='line_1737'>    How they affect the house and claim of York.</a>
<a id='line_1738'>    Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured;</a>
<a id='line_1739'>    I know no pain they can inflict upon him</a>

<a id='line_1854'>    Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?</a>
<a id='line_1855'>    Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,</a>

<a id='line_1858'>    Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore</a>

<a id='line_1862'>    Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</a>
<a id='line_1863'>    Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</a>
<a id='line_1864'>    As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</a>
<a id='line_1865'>    When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    I stood upon the hatches in the storm;</a>
<a id='line_1867'>    And when the dusky sky began to rob</a>
<a id='line_1868'>    My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    I took a costly jewel from my neck-</a>
<a id='line_1870'>    A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-</a>
<a id='line_1871'>    And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;</a>
<a id='line_1872'>    And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    And even with this I lost fair England's view,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,</a>
<a id='line_1875'>    And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue-</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    The agent of thy foul inconstancy-</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did</a>

<a id='line_1882'>    Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?</a>

<a id='line_1911'>    Upon his face an ocean of salt tears</a>
<a id='line_1912'>    To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk;</a>
<a id='line_1913'>    And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;</a>

<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>               Bed put forth with the body. Enter WARWICK</a>

<a id='line_1923'>    For, seeing him, I see my life in death.</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  WARWICK. As surely as my soul intends to live</a>

<a id='line_1926'>    To free us from his Father's wrathful curse,</a>
<a id='line_1927'>    I do believe that violent hands were laid</a>
<a id='line_1928'>    Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke.</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  SUFFOLK. A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!</a>
<a id='line_1930'>    What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  WARWICK. See how the blood is settled in his face.</a>
<a id='line_1932'>    Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,</a>
<a id='line_1933'>    Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    Being all descended to the labouring heart,</a>
<a id='line_1935'>    Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    To blush and beautify the cheek again.</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    But see, his face is black and full of blood;</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    His eye-balls further out than when he liv'd,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretch'd with struggling;</a>
<a id='line_1943'>    His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd</a>
<a id='line_1944'>    And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking;</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,</a>
<a id='line_1947'>    Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    It cannot be but he was murd'red here:</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    The least of all these signs were probable.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  SUFFOLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  WARWICK. But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes;</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  QUEEN. Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.</a>
<a id='line_1959'>  WARWICK. Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,</a>
<a id='line_1960'>    And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?</a>
<a id='line_1962'>    Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    But may imagine how the bird was dead,</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</a>
<a id='line_1965'>    Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</a>
<a id='line_1966'>  QUEEN. Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?</a>
<a id='line_1967'>    Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  SUFFOLK. I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,</a>
<a id='line_1970'>    That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart</a>
<a id='line_1971'>    That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.</a>
<a id='line_1972'>    Say if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,</a>
<a id='line_1973'>    That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.</a>
<a id='line_1974'>                           Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  WARWICK. What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  QUEEN. He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,</a>
<a id='line_1977'>    Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>    Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</a>
<a id='line_1979'>  WARWICK. Madam, be still- with reverence may I say;</a>
<a id='line_1980'>    For every word you speak in his behalf</a>
<a id='line_1981'>    Is slander to your royal dignity.</a>
<a id='line_1982'>  SUFFOLK. Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanour,</a>
<a id='line_1983'>    If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,</a>
<a id='line_1984'>    Thy mother took into her blameful bed</a>
<a id='line_1985'>    Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock</a>
<a id='line_1986'>    Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art,</a>
<a id='line_1987'>    And never of the Nevils' noble race.</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  WARWICK. But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,</a>

<a id='line_1990'>    Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,</a>
<a id='line_1991'>    And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,</a>
<a id='line_1992'>    I would, false murd'rous coward, on thy knee</a>
<a id='line_1993'>    Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech</a>

<a id='line_2277'>    How now! Why start'st thou? What, doth death affright?</a>
<a id='line_2278'>  SUFFOLK. Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</a>
<a id='line_2279'>    A cunning man did calculate my birth</a>

<a id='line_2281'>    Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;</a>
<a id='line_2282'>    Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded.</a>

<a id='line_2284'>    Never yet did base dishonour blur our name</a>

<a id='line_2290'>    The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.</a>
<a id='line_2291'>  WHITMORE. The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?</a>
<a id='line_2292'>  SUFFOLK. Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke:</a>
<a id='line_2293'>    Jove sometime went disguis'd, and why not I?</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  LIEUTENANT. But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.</a>

<a id='line_2311'>  LIEUTENANT. First let my words stab him, as he hath me.</a>
<a id='line_2312'>  SUFFOLK. Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.</a>

<a id='line_2352'>    Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!</a>
<a id='line_2353'>    Small things make base men proud: this villain here,</a>

<a id='line_2408'>  JOHN. They have the more need to sleep now, then.</a>
<a id='line_2409'>  GEORGE. I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.</a>
<a id='line_2411'>  JOHN. So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it was never</a>
<a id='line_2412'>    merry world in England since gentlemen came up.</a>
<a id='line_2413'>  GEORGE. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.</a>
<a id='line_2414'>  JOHN. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.</a>
<a id='line_2415'>  GEORGE. Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.</a>
<a id='line_2416'>  JOHN. True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is</a>
<a id='line_2417'>    as much to say as 'Let the magistrates be labouring men'; and</a>
<a id='line_2418'>    therefore should we be magistrates.</a>
<a id='line_2419'>  GEORGE. Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave</a>
<a id='line_2420'>    mind than a hard hand.</a>
<a id='line_2421'>  JOHN. I see them! I see them! There's Best's son, the tanner of</a>

<a id='line_2439'>  DICK. Silence!</a>
<a id='line_2440'>  CADE. My father was a Mortimer-</a>
<a id='line_2441'>  DICK. [Aside] He was an honest man and a good bricklayer.</a>

<a id='line_2449'>  CADE. Therefore am I of an honourable house.</a>
<a id='line_2450'>  DICK. [Aside] Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable, and there</a>

<a id='line_2458'>  CADE. I fear neither sword nor fire.</a>
<a id='line_2459'>  SMITH. [Aside] He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of</a>
<a id='line_2460'>    proof.</a>
<a id='line_2461'>  DICK. [Aside] But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being</a>
<a id='line_2462'>    burnt i' th' hand for stealing of sheep.</a>
<a id='line_2463'>  CADE. Be brave, then, for your captain is brave, and vows</a>

<a id='line_2474'>  DICK. The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.</a>
<a id='line_2475'>  CADE. Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that</a>
<a id='line_2476'>    of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That</a>

<a id='line_3390'>    It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;</a>
<a id='line_3391'>    No more will I their babes. Tears virginal</a>
<a id='line_3392'>    Shall be to me even as the dew to fire;</a>
<a id='line_3393'>    And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,</a>
<a id='line_3394'>    Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.</a>
<a id='line_3395'>    Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:</a>
<a id='line_3396'>    Meet I an infant of the house of York,</a>
<a id='line_3397'>    Into as many gobbets will I cut it</a>
<a id='line_3398'>    As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;</a>
<a id='line_3399'>    In cruelty will I seek out my fame.</a>
<a id='line_3400'>    Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house;</a>
<a id='line_3401'>    As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,</a>
<a id='line_3402'>    So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;</a>
<a id='line_3403'>    But then Aeneas bare a living load,</a>
<a id='line_3404'>    Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.</a>
<a id='line_3405'>                                              Exit with the body</a>
<a id='line_3406'></a>
<a id='line_3407'>       Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed</a>
<a id='line_3408'></a>
<a id='line_3409'>  RICHARD. So, lie thou there;</a>
<a id='line_3410'>    For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,</a>
<a id='line_3411'>    The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset</a>
<a id='line_3412'>    Hath made the wizard famous in his death.</a>
<a id='line_3413'>    Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:</a>
<a id='line_3414'>    Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.             Exit</a>
<a id='line_3415'></a>
<a id='line_3416'>        Fight. Excursions. Enter KING, QUEEN, and others</a>
<a id='line_3417'></a>
<a id='line_3418'>  QUEEN. Away, my lord! You are slow; for shame, away!</a>
<a id='line_3419'>  KING HENRY. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.</a>
<a id='line_3420'>  QUEEN. What are you made of? You'll nor fight nor fly.</a>
<a id='line_3421'>    Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence,</a>
<a id='line_3422'>    To give the enemy way, and to secure us</a>
<a id='line_3423'>    By what we can, which can no more but fly.</a>
<a id='line_3424'>                                               [Alarum afar off]</a>
<a id='line_3425'>    If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom</a>
<a id='line_3426'>    Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape-</a>
<a id='line_3427'>    As well we may, if not through your neglect-</a>
<a id='line_3428'>    We shall to London get, where you are lov'd,</a>
<a id='line_3429'>    And where this breach now in our fortunes made</a>
<a id='line_3430'>    May readily be stopp'd.</a>
<a id='line_3431'></a>
<a id='line_3432'>                     Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD</a>
<a id='line_3433'></a>
<a id='line_3434'>  YOUNG CLIFFORD. But that my heart's on future mischief set,</a>
<a id='line_3435'>    I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly;</a>
<a id='line_3436'>    But fly you must; uncurable discomfit</a>
<a id='line_3437'>    Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.</a>
<a id='line_3438'>    Away, for your relief! and we will live</a>
<a id='line_3439'>    To see their day and them our fortune give.</a>
<a id='line_3440'>    Away, my lord, away!                                  Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_3441'></a>
<a id='line_3442'>SCENE III. Fields near Saint Albans</a>
<a id='line_3443'></a>
<a id='line_3444'>Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and soldiers, with drum</a>
<a id='line_3445'>and colours</a>
<a id='line_3446'></a>
<a id='line_3447'>  YORK. Of Salisbury, who can report of him,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>    That winter lion, who in rage forgets</a>
<a id='line_3449'>    Aged contusions and all brush of time</a>
<a id='line_3450'>    And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,</a>
<a id='line_3451'>    Repairs him with occasion? This happy day</a>
<a id='line_3452'>    Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,</a>
<a id='line_3453'>    If Salisbury be lost.</a>
<a id='line_3454'>  RICHARD. My noble father,</a>
<a id='line_3455'>    Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,</a>
<a id='line_3456'>    Three times bestrid him, thrice I led him off,</a>
<a id='line_3457'>    Persuaded him from any further act;</a>
<a id='line_3458'>    But still where danger was, still there I met him;</a>
<a id='line_3459'>    And like rich hangings in a homely house,</a>
<a id='line_3460'>    So was his will in his old feeble body.</a>
<a id='line_3461'>    But, noble as he is, look where he comes.</a>
<a id='line_3462'></a>
<a id='line_3463'>                         Enter SALISBURY</a>
<a id='line_3464'></a>
<a id='line_3465'>  SALISBURY. Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day!</a>
<a id='line_3466'>    By th' mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:</a>
<a id='line_3467'>    God knows how long it is I have to live,</a>
<a id='line_3468'>    And it hath pleas'd Him that three times to-day</a>
<a id='line_3469'>    You have defended me from imminent death.</a>
<a id='line_3470'>    Well, lords, we have not got that which we have;</a>
<a id='line_3471'>    'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</a>
<a id='line_3472'>    Being opposites of such repairing nature.</a>
<a id='line_3473'>  YORK. I know our safety is to follow them;</a>
<a id='line_3474'>    For, as I hear, the King is fled to London</a>
<a id='line_3475'>    To call a present court of Parliament.</a>
<a id='line_3476'>    Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.</a>
<a id='line_3477'>    What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?</a>
<a id='line_3478'>  WARWICK. After them? Nay, before them, if we can.</a>
<a id='line_3479'>    Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:</a>
<a id='line_3480'>    Saint Albans' battle, won by famous York,</a>
<a id='line_3481'>    Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come.</a>
<a id='line_3482'>    Sound drum and trumpets and to London all;</a>
<a id='line_3483'>    And more such days as these to us befall!             Exeunt</a>
