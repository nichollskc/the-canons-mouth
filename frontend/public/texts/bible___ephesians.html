                    <a id='line_0'>The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the</a>
<a id='line_4'>saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord</a>
<a id='line_6'>Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath</a>
<a id='line_9'>blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</a>
<a id='line_10'>1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the</a>
<a id='line_11'>world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</a>
<a id='line_12'>1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus</a>
<a id='line_13'>Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 1:6 To</a>
<a id='line_14'>the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted</a>
<a id='line_15'>in the beloved.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of</a>
<a id='line_18'>sins, according to the riches of his grace; 1:8 Wherein he hath</a>
<a id='line_19'>abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 1:9 Having made known</a>
<a id='line_20'>unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which</a>
<a id='line_21'>he hath purposed in himself: 1:10 That in the dispensation of the</a>
<a id='line_22'>fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ,</a>
<a id='line_23'>both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 1:11 In</a>
<a id='line_24'>whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated</a>
<a id='line_25'>according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the</a>
<a id='line_26'>counsel of his own will: 1:12 That we should be to the praise of his</a>
<a id='line_27'>glory, who first trusted in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,</a>
<a id='line_30'>the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye</a>
<a id='line_31'>were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 1:14 Which is the</a>
<a id='line_32'>earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased</a>
<a id='line_33'>possession, unto the praise of his glory.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,</a>
<a id='line_36'>and love unto all the saints, 1:16 Cease not to give thanks for you,</a>
<a id='line_37'>making mention of you in my prayers; 1:17 That the God of our Lord</a>
<a id='line_38'>Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_39'>wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 1:18 The eyes of your</a>
<a id='line_40'>understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of</a>
<a id='line_41'>his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in</a>
<a id='line_42'>the saints, 1:19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to</a>
<a id='line_43'>us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</a>
<a id='line_44'>1:20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and</a>
<a id='line_45'>set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, 1:21 Far above</a>
<a id='line_46'>all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name</a>
<a id='line_47'>that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to</a>
<a id='line_48'>come: 1:22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be</a>
<a id='line_49'>the head over all things to the church, 1:23 Which is his body, the</a>
<a id='line_50'>fulness of him that filleth all in all.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;</a>
<a id='line_53'>2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this</a>
<a id='line_54'>world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit</a>
<a id='line_55'>that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 2:3 Among whom also</a>
<a id='line_56'>we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,</a>
<a id='line_57'>fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by</a>
<a id='line_58'>nature the children of wrath, even as others.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he</a>
<a id='line_61'>loved us, 2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us</a>
<a id='line_62'>together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 2:6 And hath raised us</a>
<a id='line_63'>up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ</a>
<a id='line_64'>Jesus: 2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches</a>
<a id='line_65'>of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of</a>
<a id='line_68'>yourselves: it is the gift of God: 2:9 Not of works, lest any man</a>
<a id='line_69'>should boast.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good</a>
<a id='line_72'>works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>2:11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the</a>
<a id='line_75'>flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the</a>
<a id='line_76'>Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 2:12 That at that time ye</a>
<a id='line_77'>were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and</a>
<a id='line_78'>strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without</a>
<a id='line_79'>God in the world: 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were</a>
<a id='line_80'>far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down</a>
<a id='line_83'>the middle wall of partition between us; 2:15 Having abolished in his</a>
<a id='line_84'>flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in</a>
<a id='line_85'>ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making</a>
<a id='line_86'>peace; 2:16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by</a>
<a id='line_87'>the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 2:17 And came and preached</a>
<a id='line_88'>peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the</a>
<a id='line_91'>Father.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but</a>
<a id='line_94'>fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 2:20 And</a>
<a id='line_95'>are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus</a>
<a id='line_96'>Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 2:21 In whom all the</a>
<a id='line_97'>building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the</a>
<a id='line_98'>Lord: 2:22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of</a>
<a id='line_99'>God through the Spirit.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>3:1 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you</a>
<a id='line_102'>Gentiles, 3:2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God</a>
<a id='line_103'>which is given me to you-ward: 3:3 How that by revelation he made</a>
<a id='line_104'>known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 3:4</a>
<a id='line_105'>Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery</a>
<a id='line_106'>of Christ) 3:5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of</a>
<a id='line_107'>men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the</a>
<a id='line_108'>Spirit; 3:6 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same</a>
<a id='line_109'>body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 3:7</a>
<a id='line_110'>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of</a>
<a id='line_111'>God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>3:8 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace</a>
<a id='line_114'>given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches</a>
<a id='line_115'>of Christ; 3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the</a>
<a id='line_116'>mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,</a>
<a id='line_117'>who created all things by Jesus Christ: 3:10 To the intent that now</a>
<a id='line_118'>unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known</a>
<a id='line_119'>by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 3:11 According to the</a>
<a id='line_120'>eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 3:12 In</a>
<a id='line_121'>whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>3:13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,</a>
<a id='line_124'>which is your glory.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus</a>
<a id='line_127'>Christ, 3:15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</a>
<a id='line_128'>3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to</a>
<a id='line_129'>be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 3:17 That</a>
<a id='line_130'>Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and</a>
<a id='line_131'>grounded in love, 3:18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what</a>
<a id='line_132'>is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 3:19 And to know</a>
<a id='line_133'>the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled</a>
<a id='line_134'>with all the fulness of God.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all</a>
<a id='line_137'>that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 3:21</a>
<a id='line_138'>Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,</a>
<a id='line_139'>world without end. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>4:1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk</a>
<a id='line_142'>worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, 4:2 With all lowliness</a>
<a id='line_143'>and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 4:3</a>
<a id='line_144'>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one</a>
<a id='line_147'>hope of your calling; 4:5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 4:6 One</a>
<a id='line_148'>God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you</a>
<a id='line_149'>all.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>4:7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure</a>
<a id='line_152'>of the gift of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity</a>
<a id='line_155'>captive, and gave gifts unto men.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first</a>
<a id='line_158'>into the lower parts of the earth?  4:10 He that descended is the same</a>
<a id='line_159'>also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all</a>
<a id='line_160'>things.)  4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and</a>
<a id='line_161'>some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 4:12 For the</a>
<a id='line_162'>perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the</a>
<a id='line_163'>edifying of the body of Christ: 4:13 Till we all come in the unity of</a>
<a id='line_164'>the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,</a>
<a id='line_165'>unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 4:14 That we</a>
<a id='line_166'>henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about</a>
<a id='line_167'>with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning</a>
<a id='line_168'>craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 4:15 But speaking the</a>
<a id='line_169'>truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head,</a>
<a id='line_170'>even Christ: 4:16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and</a>
<a id='line_171'>compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the</a>
<a id='line_172'>effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the</a>
<a id='line_173'>body unto the edifying of itself in love.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth</a>
<a id='line_176'>walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 4:18</a>
<a id='line_177'>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of</a>
<a id='line_178'>God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of</a>
<a id='line_179'>their heart: 4:19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over</a>
<a id='line_180'>unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>4:20 But ye have not so learned Christ; 4:21 If so be that ye have</a>
<a id='line_183'>heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 4:22</a>
<a id='line_184'>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which</a>
<a id='line_185'>is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 4:23 And be renewed in</a>
<a id='line_186'>the spirit of your mind; 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which</a>
<a id='line_187'>after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>4:25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his</a>
<a id='line_190'>neighbour: for we are members one of another.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>4:26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your</a>
<a id='line_193'>wrath: 4:27 Neither give place to the devil.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,</a>
<a id='line_196'>working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to</a>
<a id='line_197'>give to him that needeth.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that</a>
<a id='line_200'>which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto</a>
<a id='line_201'>the hearers.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto</a>
<a id='line_204'>the day of redemption.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>4:31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil</a>
<a id='line_207'>speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: 4:32 And be ye kind</a>
<a id='line_208'>one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for</a>
<a id='line_209'>Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>5:1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 5:2 And walk</a>
<a id='line_212'>in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us</a>
<a id='line_213'>an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not</a>
<a id='line_216'>be once named among you, as becometh saints; 5:4 Neither filthiness,</a>
<a id='line_217'>nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather</a>
<a id='line_218'>giving of thanks.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>5:5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor</a>
<a id='line_221'>covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_222'>of Christ and of God.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these</a>
<a id='line_225'>things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>5:8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:</a>
<a id='line_230'>walk as children of light: 5:9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all</a>
<a id='line_231'>goodness and righteousness and truth;) 5:10 Proving what is acceptable</a>
<a id='line_232'>unto the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>5:11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but</a>
<a id='line_235'>rather reprove them.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>5:12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of</a>
<a id='line_238'>them in secret.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>5:13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light:</a>
<a id='line_241'>for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>5:14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the</a>
<a id='line_244'>dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>5:15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</a>
<a id='line_247'>5:16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of</a>
<a id='line_250'>the Lord is.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>5:18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with</a>
<a id='line_253'>the Spirit; 5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and</a>
<a id='line_254'>spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</a>
<a id='line_255'>5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in</a>
<a id='line_256'>the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 5:21 Submitting yourselves one to</a>
<a id='line_257'>another in the fear of God.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the</a>
<a id='line_260'>Lord.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the</a>
<a id='line_263'>head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives</a>
<a id='line_266'>be to their own husbands in every thing.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,</a>
<a id='line_269'>and gave himself for it; 5:26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it</a>
<a id='line_270'>with the washing of water by the word, 5:27 That he might present it</a>
<a id='line_271'>to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such</a>
<a id='line_272'>thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>5:28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that</a>
<a id='line_275'>loveth his wife loveth himself.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>5:29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and</a>
<a id='line_278'>cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 5:30 For we are members of</a>
<a id='line_279'>his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall</a>
<a id='line_282'>be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>5:32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the</a>
<a id='line_285'>church.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>5:33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife</a>
<a id='line_288'>even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>6:2 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with</a>
<a id='line_293'>promise; 6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long</a>
<a id='line_294'>on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring</a>
<a id='line_297'>them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to</a>
<a id='line_300'>the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as</a>
<a id='line_301'>unto Christ; 6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the</a>
<a id='line_302'>servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 6:7 With</a>
<a id='line_303'>good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 6:8 Knowing</a>
<a id='line_304'>that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of</a>
<a id='line_305'>the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing</a>
<a id='line_308'>threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is</a>
<a id='line_309'>there respect of persons with him.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of</a>
<a id='line_312'>his might.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand</a>
<a id='line_315'>against the wiles of the devil.</a>
<a id='line_316'></a>
<a id='line_317'>6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against</a>
<a id='line_318'>principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of</a>
<a id='line_319'>this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be</a>
<a id='line_322'>able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>6:14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and</a>
<a id='line_325'>having on the breastplate of righteousness; 6:15 And your feet shod</a>
<a id='line_326'>with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 6:16 Above all, taking</a>
<a id='line_327'>the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the</a>
<a id='line_328'>fiery darts of the wicked.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,</a>
<a id='line_331'>which is the word of God: 6:18 Praying always with all prayer and</a>
<a id='line_332'>supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all</a>
<a id='line_333'>perseverance and supplication for all saints; 6:19 And for me, that</a>
<a id='line_334'>utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to</a>
<a id='line_335'>make known the mystery of the gospel, 6:20 For which I am an</a>
<a id='line_336'>ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to</a>
<a id='line_337'>speak.</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>6:21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a</a>
<a id='line_340'>beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to</a>
<a id='line_341'>you all things: 6:22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,</a>
<a id='line_342'>that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the</a>
<a id='line_345'>Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>6:24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in</a>
<a id='line_348'>sincerity.</a>
