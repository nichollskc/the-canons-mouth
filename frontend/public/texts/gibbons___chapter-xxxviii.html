<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The Gauls, 1 who impatiently supported the Roman yoke, received a</a>
<a id='line_8'>      memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose</a>
<a id='line_9'>      weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of</a>
<a id='line_10'>      Tacitus. 2 “The protection of the republic has delivered Gaul</a>
<a id='line_11'>      from internal discord and foreign invasions. By the loss of</a>
<a id='line_12'>      national independence, you have acquired the name and privileges</a>
<a id='line_13'>      of Roman citizens. You enjoy, in common with yourselves, the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      permanent benefits of civil government; and your remote situation</a>
<a id='line_15'>      is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny. Instead</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to</a>
<a id='line_17'>      impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation.</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Peace cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be</a>
<a id='line_19'>      supported at the expense of the people. It is for your sake, not</a>
<a id='line_20'>      for our own, that we guard the barrier of the Rhine against the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      ferocious Germans, who have so often attempted, and who will</a>
<a id='line_22'>      always desire, to exchange the solitude of their woods and</a>
<a id='line_23'>      morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul. The fall of Rome</a>
<a id='line_24'>      would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor</a>
<a id='line_26'>      and wisdom of eight hundred years. Your imaginary freedom would</a>
<a id='line_27'>      be insulted and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion</a>
<a id='line_28'>      of the Romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the Barbarian conquerors.” 3 This salutary advice was accepted,</a>
<a id='line_30'>      and this strange prediction was accomplished. In the space of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who had encountered the arms</a>
<a id='line_32'>      of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of</a>
<a id='line_33'>      citizens and subjects: the Western empire was dissolved; and the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Germans, who had passed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the</a>
<a id='line_35'>      possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of</a>
<a id='line_36'>      its peaceful and polished inhabitants. With that conscious pride</a>
<a id='line_37'>      which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to</a>
<a id='line_38'>      inspire, they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      North; their rustic manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite,</a>
<a id='line_40'>      and their horrid appearance, equally disgusting to the sight and</a>
<a id='line_41'>      to the smell. The liberal studies were still cultivated in the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      schools of Autun and Bordeaux; and the language of Cicero and</a>
<a id='line_43'>      Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their ears were</a>
<a id='line_44'>      astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic</a>
<a id='line_45'>      dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses</a>
<a id='line_46'>      fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre. The Gauls were</a>
<a id='line_47'>      endowed with all the advantages of art and nature; but as they</a>
<a id='line_48'>      wanted courage to defend them, they were justly condemned to</a>
<a id='line_49'>      obey, and even to flatter, the victorious Barbarians, by whose</a>
<a id='line_50'>      clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives. 4</a>

<a id='line_76'>      As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire, he sought</a>
<a id='line_77'>      the friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians. The new</a>

<a id='line_79'>      the Roman conquests beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      Ocean: 5 and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some</a>
<a id='line_81'>      ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue and</a>
<a id='line_82'>      dominion. The lawful pretensions of Euric were justified by</a>
<a id='line_83'>      ambition and success; and the Gothic nation might aspire, under</a>
<a id='line_84'>      his command, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul. Arles and</a>
<a id='line_85'>      Marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom of</a>
<a id='line_86'>      Auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from</a>
<a id='line_87'>      exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. Sidonius waited</a>
<a id='line_88'>      before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and</a>

<a id='line_96'>      imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. The</a>
<a id='line_97'>      Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Ostrogoths of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against</a>

<a id='line_121'>      (Mem. de ‘Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 68.)]</a>
<a id='line_122'></a>
<a id='line_123'>      While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany,</a>
<a id='line_124'>      he was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      king, of the Thuringians. After his restoration, Basina escaped</a>
<a id='line_126'>      from her husband’s bed to the arms of her lover; freely</a>
<a id='line_127'>      declaring, that if she had known a man wiser, stronger, or more</a>
<a id='line_128'>      beautiful, than Childeric, that man should have been the object</a>
<a id='line_129'>      of her preference. 8 9 Clovis was the offspring of this voluntary</a>
<a id='line_130'>      union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of age, he</a>
<a id='line_131'>      succeeded, by his father’s death, to the command of the Salian</a>
<a id='line_132'>      tribe. The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the</a>
<a id='line_133'>      island of the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and</a>
<a id='line_134'>      Arras; 10 and at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors</a>
<a id='line_135'>      could not exceed five thousand. The kindred tribes of the Franks,</a>
<a id='line_136'>      who had seated themselves along the Belgic rivers, the Scheld,</a>
<a id='line_137'>      the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, were governed by their</a>
<a id='line_138'>      independent kings, of the Merovingian race; the equals, the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      allies, and sometimes the enemies of the Salic prince. But the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      Germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary jurisdiction of</a>
<a id='line_141'>      their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of a popular and</a>
<a id='line_142'>      victorious general; and the superior merit of Clovis attracted</a>
<a id='line_143'>      the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy. When he</a>
<a id='line_144'>      first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his</a>
<a id='line_145'>      coffers, nor wine and corn in his magazine; 11 but he imitated</a>
<a id='line_146'>      the example of Caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired</a>
<a id='line_147'>      wealth by the sword, and purchased soldiers with the fruits of</a>
<a id='line_148'>      conquest. After each successful battle or expedition, the spoils</a>
<a id='line_149'>      were accumulated in one common mass; every warrior received his</a>
<a id='line_150'>      proportionable share; and the royal prerogative submitted to the</a>
<a id='line_151'>      equal regulations of military law. The untamed spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_152'>      Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular</a>
<a id='line_153'>      discipline. 12 At the annual review of the month of March, their</a>
<a id='line_154'>      arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed a</a>
<a id='line_155'>      peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade of</a>
<a id='line_156'>      grass. The justice of Clovis was inexorable; and his careless or</a>
<a id='line_157'>      disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death. It would</a>
<a id='line_158'>      be superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank; but the valor of</a>
<a id='line_159'>      Clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence. 13 In all</a>
<a id='line_160'>      his transactions with mankind, he calculated the weight of</a>
<a id='line_161'>      interest, of passion, and of opinion; and his measures were</a>
<a id='line_162'>      sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans, and</a>
<a id='line_163'>      sometimes moderated by the milder genius of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_164'>      Christianity. He was intercepted in the career of victory, since</a>
<a id='line_165'>      he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already</a>
<a id='line_166'>      accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of</a>

<a id='line_201'>      The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius, the son</a>

<a id='line_203'>      inflamed by private resentment. The glory of the father still</a>
<a id='line_204'>      insulted the Merovingian race; the power of the son might excite</a>
<a id='line_205'>      the jealous ambition of the king of the Franks. Syagrius</a>
<a id='line_206'>      inherited, as a patrimonial estate, the city and diocese of</a>
<a id='line_207'>      Soissons: the desolate remnant of the second Belgic, Rheims and</a>

<a id='line_210'>      he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority, of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      king of the Romans. 15 As a Roman, he had been educated in the</a>
<a id='line_212'>      liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged</a>
<a id='line_213'>      by accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom.</a>
<a id='line_214'>      The independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a</a>

<a id='line_216'>      their native tongue, the dictates of reason and equity. The</a>
<a id='line_217'>      diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular, the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary</a>
<a id='line_219'>      obedience, and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and</a>
<a id='line_220'>      Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil</a>
<a id='line_221'>      society. 16 In the midst of these peaceful occupations, Syagrius</a>
<a id='line_222'>      received, and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis;</a>
<a id='line_223'>      who challenged his rival in the spirit, and almost in the</a>
<a id='line_224'>      language, of chivalry, to appoint the day and the field 17 of</a>
<a id='line_225'>      battle. In the time of Caesar Soissons would have poured forth a</a>
<a id='line_226'>      body of fifty thousand horse and such an army might have been</a>
<a id='line_227'>      plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and military</a>
<a id='line_228'>      engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city. 18</a>
<a id='line_229'>      But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since</a>
<a id='line_230'>      exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who</a>
<a id='line_231'>      marched under the standard of Syagrius, were incapable of</a>
<a id='line_232'>      contending with the national valor of the Franks. It would be</a>
<a id='line_233'>      ungenerous without some more accurate knowledge of his strength</a>
<a id='line_234'>      and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius, who</a>
<a id='line_235'>      escaped, after the loss of a battle, to the distant court of</a>
<a id='line_236'>      Thoulouse. The feeble minority of Alaric could not assist or</a>

<a id='line_239'>      short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      executioner. The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the</a>
<a id='line_241'>      Franks; and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the</a>
<a id='line_242'>      ample diocese of Tongres 20 which Clovis subdued in the tenth</a>

<a id='line_309'>      forever the alternative of empire or servitude. The last king of</a>
<a id='line_310'>      the Alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were</a>
<a id='line_311'>      slaughtered or pursued, till they threw down their arms, and</a>
<a id='line_312'>      yielded to the mercy of the conqueror. Without discipline it was</a>

<a id='line_371'>      the churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of Gaul</a>
<a id='line_372'>      enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops</a>
<a id='line_373'>      entertained a more favorable hope of the idolater, than of the</a>
<a id='line_374'>      heretics. The Merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate</a>
<a id='line_375'>      alliance with the fair Clotilda, the niece of the king of</a>
<a id='line_376'>      Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian court, was educated in</a>
<a id='line_377'>      the profession of the Catholic faith. It was her interest, as</a>
<a id='line_378'>      well as her duty, to achieve the conversion 26 of a Pagan</a>
<a id='line_379'>      husband; and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and</a>
<a id='line_380'>      religion. He consented (perhaps such terms had been previously</a>
<a id='line_381'>      stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest son; and though the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he</a>
<a id='line_383'>      was persuaded, a second time, to repeat the dangerous experiment.</a>
<a id='line_384'>      In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked</a>
<a id='line_385'>      the God of Clotilda and the Christians; and victory disposed him</a>
<a id='line_386'>      to hear, with respectful gratitude, the eloquent 27 Remigius, 28</a>
<a id='line_387'>      bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed the temporal and</a>
<a id='line_388'>      spiritual advantages of his conversion. The king declared himself</a>
<a id='line_389'>      satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith; and the political</a>
<a id='line_390'>      reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were</a>
<a id='line_391'>      removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who</a>
<a id='line_392'>      showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to</a>
<a id='line_393'>      the field of battle, or to the baptismal font. The important</a>
<a id='line_394'>      ceremony was performed in the cathedral of Rheims, with every</a>
<a id='line_395'>      circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an</a>
<a id='line_396'>      awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes. 29</a>
<a id='line_397'>      The new Constantine was immediately baptized, with three thousand</a>
<a id='line_398'>      of his warlike subjects; and their example was imitated by the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      remainder of the gentle Barbarians, who, in obedience to the</a>
<a id='line_400'>      victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and</a>
<a id='line_401'>      burnt the idols which they had formerly adored. 30 The mind of</a>
<a id='line_402'>      Clovis was susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by</a>
<a id='line_403'>      the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ; and,</a>
<a id='line_404'>      instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious</a>
<a id='line_405'>      sacrifice, he exclaimed, with indiscreet fury, “Had I been</a>
<a id='line_406'>      present at the head of my valiant Franks, I would have revenged</a>
<a id='line_407'>      his injuries.” 31 But the savage conqueror of Gaul was incapable</a>
<a id='line_408'>      of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends on the</a>
<a id='line_409'>      laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative</a>
<a id='line_410'>      theology. He was still more incapable of feeling the mild</a>
<a id='line_411'>      influence of the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart</a>
<a id='line_412'>      of a genuine convert. His ambitious reign was a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_413'>      violation of moral and Christian duties: his hands were stained</a>
<a id='line_414'>      with blood in peace as well as in war; and, as soon as Clovis had</a>
<a id='line_415'>      dismissed a synod of the Gallican church, he calmly assassinated</a>
<a id='line_416'>      all the princes of the Merovingian race. 32 Yet the king of the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God, as a Being more</a>
<a id='line_418'>      excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the signal</a>
<a id='line_419'>      deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide</a>
<a id='line_420'>      in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts. Martin, the most</a>
<a id='line_421'>      popular of the saints, had filled the Western world with the fame</a>
<a id='line_422'>      of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy</a>
<a id='line_423'>      sepulchre of Tours. His visible or invisible aid promoted the</a>
<a id='line_424'>      cause of a liberal and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of</a>
<a id='line_425'>      Clovis himself, that St.Martin was an expensive friend, 33 need</a>
<a id='line_426'>      not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational</a>
<a id='line_427'>      scepticism. But earth, as well as heaven, rejoiced in the</a>
<a id='line_428'>      conversion of the Franks. On the memorable day when Clovis</a>
<a id='line_429'>      ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the Christian</a>
<a id='line_430'>      world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king. The</a>

<a id='line_432'>      the nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of</a>

<a id='line_764'>      youthful fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius</a>
<a id='line_765'>      of his rival. Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their</a>
<a id='line_766'>      contiguous dominions; and after the delays of fruitless</a>
<a id='line_767'>      negotiation, a personal interview of the two kings was proposed</a>
<a id='line_768'>      and accepted. The conference of Clovis and Alaric was held in a</a>
<a id='line_769'>      small island of the Loire, near Amboise. They embraced,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      familiarly conversed, and feasted together; and separated with</a>
<a id='line_771'>      the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love. But their</a>
<a id='line_772'>      apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and</a>
<a id='line_773'>      treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited,</a>
<a id='line_774'>      eluded, and disclaimed, a final arbitration. At Paris, which he</a>
<a id='line_775'>      already considered as his royal seat, Clovis declared to an</a>
<a id='line_776'>      assembly of the princes and warriors, the pretence, and the</a>
<a id='line_777'>      motive, of a Gothic war. “It grieves me to see that the Arians</a>
<a id='line_778'>      still possess the fairest portion of Gaul. Let us march against</a>
<a id='line_779'>      them with the aid of God; and, having vanquished the heretics, we</a>
<a id='line_780'>      will possess and divide their fertile provinces.” 46 The Franks,</a>
<a id='line_781'>      who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal, applauded</a>
<a id='line_782'>      the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution</a>
<a id='line_783'>      to conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally</a>
<a id='line_784'>      profitable; and solemnly protested that they would never shave</a>
<a id='line_785'>      their beards till victory should absolve them from that</a>
<a id='line_786'>      inconvenient vow. The enterprise was promoted by the public or</a>
<a id='line_787'>      private exhortations of Clotilda. She reminded her husband how</a>
<a id='line_788'>      effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the Deity, and</a>
<a id='line_789'>      his servants: and the Christian hero, darting his battle-axe with</a>
<a id='line_790'>      a skilful and nervous band, “There, (said he,) on that spot where</a>
<a id='line_791'>      my Francisca, 47 shall fall, will I erect a church in honor of</a>
<a id='line_792'>      the holy apostles.” This ostentatious piety confirmed and</a>
<a id='line_793'>      justified the attachment of the Catholics, with whom he secretly</a>
<a id='line_794'>      corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into</a>
<a id='line_795'>      a formidable conspiracy. The people of Aquitain were alarmed by</a>
<a id='line_796'>      the indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants, who justly</a>
<a id='line_797'>      accused them of preferring the dominion of the Franks: and their</a>
<a id='line_798'>      zealous adherent Quintianus, bishop of Rodez, 48 preached more</a>

<a id='line_800'>      foreign and domestic enemies, who were fortified by the alliance</a>
<a id='line_801'>      of the Burgundians, Alaric collected his troops, far more</a>
<a id='line_802'>      numerous than the military powers of Clovis. The Visigoths</a>
<a id='line_803'>      resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in a long</a>

<a id='line_852'>      messengers were instructed to remark the words of the Psalm which</a>
<a id='line_853'>      should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they</a>
<a id='line_854'>      entered the church. Those words most fortunately expressed the</a>

<a id='line_856'>      was easily transferred to the new Joshua, the new Gideon, who</a>
<a id='line_857'>      went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord. 51 Orleans</a>
<a id='line_858'>      secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance</a>
<a id='line_859'>      of forty miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by</a>
<a id='line_860'>      an extraordinary swell of the River Vigenna or Vienne; and the</a>

<a id='line_862'>      Delay must be always dangerous to Barbarians, who consume the</a>
<a id='line_863'>      country through which they march; and had Clovis possessed</a>
<a id='line_864'>      leisure and materials, it might have been impracticable to</a>
<a id='line_865'>      construct a bridge, or to force a passage, in the face of a</a>
<a id='line_866'>      superior enemy. But the affectionate peasants who were impatient</a>
<a id='line_867'>      to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown or</a>
<a id='line_868'>      unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the</a>
<a id='line_869'>      useful interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of</a>
<a id='line_870'>      singular size and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march</a>
<a id='line_871'>      of the Catholic army. The counsels of the Visigoths were</a>
<a id='line_872'>      irresolute and distracted. A crowd of impatient warriors,</a>
<a id='line_873'>      presumptuous in their strength, and disdaining to fly before the</a>
<a id='line_874'>      robbers of Germany, excited Alaric to assert in arms the name and</a>
<a id='line_875'>      blood of the conquerors of Rome. The advice of the graver</a>
<a id='line_876'>      chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the Franks;</a>
<a id='line_877'>      and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran and</a>
<a id='line_878'>      victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already sent to</a>
<a id='line_879'>      his assistance. The decisive moments were wasted in idle</a>
<a id='line_880'>      deliberation the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an</a>
<a id='line_881'>      advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was</a>
<a id='line_882'>      lost by their slow and disorderly motions. After Clovis had</a>
<a id='line_883'>      passed the ford, as it is still named, of the Hart, he advanced</a>
<a id='line_884'>      with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy. His</a>
<a id='line_885'>      nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspended in</a>
<a id='line_886'>      the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which</a>
<a id='line_887'>      might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St.</a>
<a id='line_888'>      Hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the</a>
<a id='line_889'>      Israelites in the desert. At the third hour of the day, about ten</a>
<a id='line_890'>      miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis overtook, and instantly attacked,</a>
<a id='line_891'>      the Gothic army; whose defeat was already prepared by terror and</a>
<a id='line_892'>      confusion. Yet they rallied in their extreme distress, and the</a>
<a id='line_893'>      martial youths, who had clamorously demanded the battle, refused</a>
<a id='line_894'>      to survive the ignominy of flight. The two kings encountered each</a>
<a id='line_895'>      other in single combat. Alaric fell by the hand of his rival; and</a>
<a id='line_896'>      the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass,</a>
<a id='line_897'>      and the vigor of his horse, from the spears of two desperate</a>
<a id='line_898'>      Goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of</a>

<a id='line_903'>      the nobles of Auvergne. Perhaps these suspected Catholics had</a>
<a id='line_904'>      been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy; and</a>
<a id='line_905'>      perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal</a>

<a id='line_935'>      followed by the conquest of Aquitain. Alaric had left behind him</a>

<a id='line_940'>      without delay to the siege of Angoulême. At the sound of his</a>
<a id='line_941'>      trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho,</a>

<a id='line_1167'>      compose the Salic laws; 66 and their labors were examined and</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      approved in three successive assemblies of the people. After the</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      baptism of Clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      incompatible with Christianity: the Salic law was again amended</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      by his sons; and at length, under the reign of Dagobert, the code</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      was revised and promulgated in its actual form, one hundred years</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      after the establishment of the French monarchy. Within the same</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      period, the customs of the Ripuarians were transcribed and</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      published; and Charlemagne himself, the legislator of his age and</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      country, had accurately studied the two national laws, which</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      still prevailed among the Franks. 67 The same care was extended</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      to their vassals; and the rude institutions of the Alemanni and</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      Bavarians were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      authority of the Merovingian kings. The Visigoths and</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      Burgundians, whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      Franks, showed less impatience to attain one of the principal</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      benefits of civilized society. Euric was the first of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      princes who expressed, in writing, the manners and customs of his</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      people; and the composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      of policy rather than of justice; to alleviate the yoke, and</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      regain the affections, of their Gallic subjects. 68 Thus, by a</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      singular coincidence, the Germans framed their artless</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      institutions, at a time when the elaborate system of Roman</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      jurisprudence was finally consummated. In the Salic laws, and the</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      Pandects of Justinian, we may compare the first rudiments, and</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      the full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      be suggested in favor of Barbarism, our calmer reflections will</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      ascribe to the Romans the superior advantages, not only of</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      science and reason, but of humanity and justice. Yet the laws 681</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires, their</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      preserve the peace, and promote the improvement, of the society</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      for whose use they were originally established. The Merovingians,</a>

<a id='line_1203'>      the Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      toleration. 70 The children embraced the law of their parents,</a>

<a id='line_1342'>      pieces of gold. Had these laws been regulated by any principle of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      equity or reason, the public protection should have supplied, in</a>

<a id='line_1345'>      legislator had weighed in the scale, not of justice, but of</a>

<a id='line_1860'>      rises towards the south into the mountains of the Cevennes,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures; the</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      crowned with a villa or castle. In the Lower Auvergne, the River</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne; and</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      supplies, without any interval of repose, the constant repetition</a>

<a id='line_1869'>      Auvergne were betrayed by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris.</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      Childebert enjoyed this clandestine victory; and the free</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      subjects of Theodoric threatened to desert his standard, if he</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      indulged his private resentment, while the nation was engaged in</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      the Burgundian war. But the Franks of Austrasia soon yielded to</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      the persuasive eloquence of their king. “Follow me,” said</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      Theodoric, “into Auvergne; I will lead you into a province, where</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      you may acquire gold, silver, slaves, cattle, and precious</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      apparel, to the full extent of your wishes. I repeat my promise;</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      I give you the people and their wealth as your prey; and you may</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      transport them at pleasure into your own country.” By the</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      execution of this promise, Theodoric justly forfeited the</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      allegiance of a people whom he devoted to destruction. His</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      troops, reenforced by the fiercest Barbarians of Germany, 104</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne; and two</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      redeemed from their licentious fury. The castle of Meroliac 105</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      was seated on a lofty rock, which rose a hundred feet above the</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      surface of the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      enclosed, with some arable lands, within the circle of its</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      fortifications. The Franks beheld with envy and despair this</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      impregnable fortress; but they surprised a party of fifty</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number of their</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      captives, they fixed, at a trifling ransom, the alternative of</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      Barbarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the</a>

<a id='line_1896'>      Brioude, where the inhabitants, with their valuable effects, had</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      taken refuge in the sanctuary of St. Julian. The doors of the</a>

<a id='line_1961'>      exacted some pledges of the future loyalty of a people, whose</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      just hatred could be restrained only by their fear. A select band</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      of noble youths, the sons of the principal senators, was</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      delivered to the conqueror, as the hostages of the faith of</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      Childebert, and of their countrymen. On the first rumor of war,</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      or conspiracy, these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      servitude; and one of them, Attalus, 107 whose adventures are</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      more particularly related, kept his master’s horses in the</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      diocese of Treves. After a painful search, he was discovered, in</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather,</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      Gregory bishop of Langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      rejected by the avarice of the Barbarian, who required an</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      exorbitant sum of ten pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      captive. His deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      Leo, a slave belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of Langres.</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      108 An unknown agent easily introduced him into the same family.</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      The Barbarian purchased Leo for the price of twelve pieces of</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      gold; and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      luxury of an episcopal table: “Next Sunday,” said the Frank, “I</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen. Exert thy art, and force</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      them to confess, that they have never seen, or tasted, such an</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      entertainment, even in the king’s house.” Leo assured him, that</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      should be satisfied. The master who already aspired to the merit</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      of elegant hospitality, assumed, as his own, the praise which the</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      dexterous Leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      household. After the patient expectation of a whole year, he</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      cautiously whispered his design to Attalus, and exhorted him to</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      prepare for flight in the ensuing night. At the hour of midnight,</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      the intemperate guests retired from the table; and the Frank’s</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      son-in-law, whom Leo attended to his apartment with a nocturnal</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which he</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      might betray his trust. The intrepid slave, after sustaining this</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      dangerous raillery, entered his master’s bedchamber; removed his</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      spear and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      stable; unbarred the ponderous gates; and excited Attalus to save</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      his life and liberty by incessant diligence. Their apprehensions</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the Meuse; 109</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      they swam the river, wandered three days in the adjacent forest,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      plum-tree. As they lay concealed in a dark thicket, they heard</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry countenance</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      of their master, and they anxiously listened to his declaration,</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, one of them he</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      a gibbet. A length, Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      friendly habitation of a presbyter of Rheims, who recruited their</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      fainting strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      search of their enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      limits of the Austrasian kingdom, to the episcopal palace of</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      Langres. Gregory embraced his grandson with tears of joy,</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      gratefully delivered Leo, with his whole family, from the yoke of</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      servitude, and bestowed on him the property of a farm, where he</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      might end his days in happiness and freedom. Perhaps this</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances of</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      truth and nature, was related by Attalus himself, to his cousin</a>

<a id='line_2080'>      citizens. A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use</a>

<a id='line_2103'>      Barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from the</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      dignities, and even from the orders, of the church. 115 The</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      clergy of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials;</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      the haughty Franks fell at the feet of their subjects, who were</a>

<a id='line_2108'>      which had been lost in war, were insensibly recovered by</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      superstition. 116 In all temporal affairs, the Theodosian Code</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      was the universal law of the clergy; but the Barbaric</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety; a</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      sub-deacon was equivalent to two Franks; the antrustion, and</a>

<a id='line_2115'>      nine hundred pieces of gold. 117 The Romans communicated to their</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      conquerors the use of the Christian religion and Latin language;</a>

<a id='line_2266'>      ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal</a>

<a id='line_2713'>      blood and military renown. The tomb of Vortimer, the son of</a>

<a id='line_2715'>      landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      in the fields of Kent. Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      noble family of Romans; 138 his modesty was equal to his valor,</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      and his valor, till the last fatal action, 139 was crowned with</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      splendid success. But every British name is effaced by the</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      illustrious name of Arthur, 140 the hereditary prince of the</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      Silures, in South Wales, and the elective king or general of the</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      nation. According to the most rational account, he defeated, in</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      twelve successive battles, the Angles of the North, and the</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the hero was</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes. The</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      events of his life are less interesting than the singular</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely</a>
<a id='line_2729'>      embellished, by the obscure bards of Wales and Armorica, who were</a>
<a id='line_2730'>      odious to the Saxons, and unknown to the rest of mankind. The</a>
<a id='line_2731'>      pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors prompted them to</a>
<a id='line_2732'>      inquire into the ancient history of Britain: they listened with</a>
<a id='line_2733'>      fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the</a>
<a id='line_2734'>      merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common</a>
<a id='line_2735'>      enemies. His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of</a>
<a id='line_2736'>      Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of</a>
<a id='line_2737'>      the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent,</a>
<a id='line_2738'>      ornaments which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or</a>
<a id='line_2739'>      the fancy, of the twelfth century. The progress of a Phrygian</a>
<a id='line_2740'>      colony, from the Tyber to the Thames, was easily ingrafted on the</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      fable of the Aeneid; and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      Caesars. His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged the recent</a>
<a id='line_2745'>      injuries of his country. The gallantry and superstition of the</a>
<a id='line_2746'>      British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable</a>
<a id='line_2747'>      institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully</a>
<a id='line_2748'>      copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      exploits of Uther’s son appear less incredible than the</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the</a>

<a id='line_3184'>      The Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province,</a>
<a id='line_3185'>      imputed the triumphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the</a>
<a id='line_3186'>      fortune, of the republic. The inconstant goddess, who so blindly</a>
<a id='line_3187'>      distributes and resumes her favors, had now consented (such was</a>
<a id='line_3188'>      the language of envious flattery) to resign her wings, to descend</a>
<a id='line_3189'>      from her globe, and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the</a>
<a id='line_3190'>      banks of the Tyber. 1000 A wiser Greek, who has composed, with a</a>
<a id='line_3191'>      philosophic spirit, the memorable history of his own times,</a>
<a id='line_3192'>      deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort, by</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      Rome. 2000 The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      prejudices of religion. Honor, as well as virtue, was the</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      principle of the republic; the ambitious citizens labored to</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      deserve the solemn glories of a triumph; and the ardor of the</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      Roman youth was kindled into active emulation, as often as they</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      beheld the domestic images of their ancestors. 3000 The temperate</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      the firm and equal balance of the constitution; which united the</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and wisdom of a</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. When the</a>
<a id='line_3205'>      consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound</a>
<a id='line_3206'>      himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the</a>
<a id='line_3207'>      cause of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a</a>
<a id='line_3208'>      military service of ten years. This wise institution continually</a>
<a id='line_3209'>      poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      soldiers; and their numbers were reenforced by the warlike and</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      populous states of Italy, who, after a brave resistance, had</a>
<a id='line_3212'>      yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance, of the Romans.</a>

<a id='line_3214'>      and beheld the ruin of Carthage, 4000 has accurately described</a>

<a id='line_3224'>      and courage. The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in</a>

<a id='line_3267'>      The rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as</a>
<a id='line_3268'>      a singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. But the</a>
<a id='line_3269'>      decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of</a>
<a id='line_3270'>      immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay;</a>
<a id='line_3271'>      the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest;</a>
<a id='line_3272'>      and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial</a>
<a id='line_3273'>      supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its</a>
<a id='line_3274'>      own weight. The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and</a>
<a id='line_3275'>      instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we</a>
<a id='line_3276'>      should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The</a>
<a id='line_3277'>      victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of</a>
<a id='line_3278'>      strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the</a>
<a id='line_3279'>      republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The</a>
<a id='line_3280'>      emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,</a>
<a id='line_3281'>      were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline</a>
<a id='line_3282'>      which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to</a>
<a id='line_3283'>      the enemy; the vigor of the military government was relaxed, and</a>
<a id='line_3284'>      finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine;</a>
<a id='line_3285'>      and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_3286'></a>
<a id='line_3287'>      The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation</a>
<a id='line_3288'>      of the seat of empire; but this History has already shown, that</a>
<a id='line_3289'>      the powers of government were divided, rather than removed. The</a>
<a id='line_3290'>      throne of Constantinople was erected in the East; while the West</a>
<a id='line_3291'>      was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their</a>
<a id='line_3292'>      residence in Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the</a>
<a id='line_3293'>      legions and provinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the</a>
<a id='line_3294'>      strength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the</a>
<a id='line_3295'>      instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were</a>
<a id='line_3296'>      multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was</a>
<a id='line_3297'>      introduced and supported between the degenerate successors of</a>
<a id='line_3298'>      Theodosius. Extreme distress, which unites the virtue of a free</a>
<a id='line_3299'>      people, imbitters the factions of a declining monarchy. The</a>
<a id='line_3300'>      hostile favorites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic</a>
<a id='line_3301'>      to its common enemies; and the Byzantine court beheld with</a>
<a id='line_3302'>      indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace of Rome, the</a>
<a id='line_3303'>      misfortunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the</a>
<a id='line_3304'>      succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored;</a>
<a id='line_3305'>      but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and</a>
<a id='line_3306'>      ineffectual; and the national schism of the Greeks and Latins was</a>
<a id='line_3307'>      enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of</a>
<a id='line_3308'>      interests, and even of religion. Yet the salutary event approved</a>
<a id='line_3309'>      in some measure the judgment of Constantine. During a long period</a>
<a id='line_3310'>      of decay, his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of</a>
<a id='line_3311'>      Barbarians, protected the wealth of Asia, and commanded, both in</a>
<a id='line_3312'>      peace and war, the important straits which connect the Euxine and</a>
<a id='line_3313'>      Mediterranean Seas. The foundation of Constantinople more</a>
<a id='line_3314'>      essentially contributed to the preservation of the East, than to</a>
<a id='line_3315'>      the ruin of the West.</a>
<a id='line_3316'></a>
<a id='line_3317'>      As the happiness of a future life is the great object of</a>
<a id='line_3318'>      religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal, that the</a>
<a id='line_3319'>      introduction or at least the abuse, of Christianity had some</a>
<a id='line_3320'>      influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy</a>
<a id='line_3321'>      successfully preached the doctrines of patience and</a>
<a id='line_3322'>      pusillanimity: the active virtues of society were discouraged;</a>
<a id='line_3323'>      and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the</a>
<a id='line_3324'>      cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was</a>
<a id='line_3325'>      consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and</a>
<a id='line_3326'>      the soldiers’ pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both</a>
<a id='line_3327'>      sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and</a>
<a id='line_3328'>      chastity. 511 Faith, zeal, curiosity, and the more earthly</a>
<a id='line_3329'>      passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological</a>
<a id='line_3330'>      discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by</a>
<a id='line_3331'>      religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody, and</a>
<a id='line_3332'>      always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted</a>
<a id='line_3333'>      from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new</a>
<a id='line_3334'>      species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret</a>
<a id='line_3335'>      enemies of their country. Yet party spirit, however pernicious or</a>
<a id='line_3336'>      absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. The</a>
<a id='line_3337'>      bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of</a>
<a id='line_3338'>      passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their</a>
<a id='line_3339'>      frequent assemblies, and perpetual correspondence, maintained the</a>
<a id='line_3340'>      communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the</a>
<a id='line_3341'>      gospel was strengthened, though confined, by the spiritual</a>
<a id='line_3342'>      alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was</a>
<a id='line_3343'>      devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if</a>
<a id='line_3344'>      superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices</a>
<a id='line_3345'>      would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser</a>
<a id='line_3346'>      motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are</a>
<a id='line_3347'>      easily obeyed, which indulge and sanctify the natural</a>
<a id='line_3348'>      inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine</a>
<a id='line_3349'>      influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though</a>
<a id='line_3350'>      imperfect, effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the North. If</a>
<a id='line_3351'>      the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of</a>
<a id='line_3352'>      Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the</a>

<a id='line_3383'>      Northern countries of Europe and Asia were filled with</a>
<a id='line_3384'>      innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and</a>
<a id='line_3385'>      turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to ravish the fruits of</a>
<a id='line_3386'>      industry. The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse</a>
<a id='line_3387'>      of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant</a>
<a id='line_3388'>      revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a victorious</a>
<a id='line_3389'>      enemy, directed their march towards the West; and the torrent was</a>
<a id='line_3390'>      swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The</a>

<a id='line_3432'>      the hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the</a>
<a id='line_3433'>      character of Roman citizens; and the provinces of the West were</a>
<a id='line_3434'>      reluctantly torn by the Barbarians from the bosom of their mother</a>

<a id='line_3436'>      national freedom and military spirit; and the servile provinces,</a>
<a id='line_3437'>      destitute of life and motion, expected their safety from the</a>
<a id='line_3438'>      mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders</a>
<a id='line_3439'>      of a distant court. The happiness of a hundred millions depended</a>
<a id='line_3440'>      on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose</a>
<a id='line_3441'>      minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power.</a>
<a id='line_3442'>      The deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the</a>

<a id='line_3445'>      abandoned the church to the bishops, the state to the eunuchs,</a>
<a id='line_3446'>      and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe is now divided into</a>
<a id='line_3447'>      twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three respectable</a>
<a id='line_3448'>      commonwealths, and a variety of smaller, though independent,</a>

<a id='line_3454'>      republics have acquired order and stability; monarchies have</a>
<a id='line_3455'>      imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at least, of moderation;</a>

<a id='line_3458'>      peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by</a>
<a id='line_3459'>      the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the European</a>
<a id='line_3460'>      forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. If a</a>
<a id='line_3461'>      savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary, he</a>
<a id='line_3462'>      must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia, the</a>

<a id='line_3553'>      threefold aspect. 1. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age</a>

<a id='line_3555'>      powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions;</a>

<a id='line_3558'>      the lessons of a preceptor. 2. The benefits of law and policy, of</a>
<a id='line_3559'>      trade and manufactures, of arts and sciences, are more solid and</a>

<a id='line_3561'>      and discipline, to promote, in their respective stations, the</a>
