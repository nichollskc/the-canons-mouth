<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>            Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>  RUMOUR. Open your ears; for which of you will stop</a>
<a id='line_74'>    The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</a>
<a id='line_75'>    I, from the orient to the drooping west,</a>
<a id='line_76'>    Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</a>
<a id='line_77'>    The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</a>
<a id='line_78'>    Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</a>
<a id='line_79'>    The which in every language I pronounce,</a>
<a id='line_80'>    Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</a>
<a id='line_81'>    I speak of peace while covert emnity,</a>
<a id='line_82'>    Under the smile of safety, wounds the world;</a>
<a id='line_83'>    And who but Rumour, who but only I,</a>
<a id='line_84'>    Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</a>
<a id='line_86'>    Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</a>
<a id='line_87'>    And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</a>
<a id='line_88'>    Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</a>
<a id='line_89'>    And of so easy and so plain a stop</a>
<a id='line_90'>    That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</a>
<a id='line_91'>    The still-discordant wav'ring multitude,</a>
<a id='line_92'>    Can play upon it. But what need I thus</a>
<a id='line_93'>    My well-known body to anatomize</a>
<a id='line_94'>    Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</a>
<a id='line_95'>    I run before King Harry's victory,</a>
<a id='line_96'>    Who, in a bloody field by Shrewsbury,</a>
<a id='line_97'>    Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</a>
<a id='line_98'>    Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</a>
<a id='line_99'>    Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I</a>
<a id='line_100'>    To speak so true at first? My office is</a>
<a id='line_101'>    To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</a>
<a id='line_102'>    Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,</a>
<a id='line_103'>    And that the King before the Douglas' rage</a>
<a id='line_104'>    Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.</a>
<a id='line_105'>    This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns</a>
<a id='line_106'>    Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</a>
<a id='line_107'>    And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</a>
<a id='line_108'>    Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,</a>
<a id='line_109'>    Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</a>
<a id='line_110'>    And not a man of them brings other news</a>
<a id='line_111'>    Than they have learnt of me. From Rumour's tongues</a>
<a id='line_112'>    They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.</a>

<a id='line_124'>  PORTER. What shall I say you are?</a>
<a id='line_125'>  LORD BARDOLPH. Tell thou the Earl</a>
<a id='line_126'>    That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</a>
<a id='line_127'>  PORTER. His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard.</a>
<a id='line_128'>    Please it your honour knock but at the gate,</a>
<a id='line_129'>    And he himself will answer.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>                      Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>  LORD BARDOLPH. Here comes the Earl.                Exit PORTER</a>
<a id='line_134'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now</a>
<a id='line_135'>    Should be the father of some stratagem.</a>
<a id='line_136'>    The times are wild; contention, like a horse</a>
<a id='line_137'>    Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose</a>
<a id='line_138'>    And bears down all before him.</a>
<a id='line_139'>  LORD BARDOLPH. Noble Earl,</a>
<a id='line_140'>    I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</a>
<a id='line_141'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Good, an God will!</a>
<a id='line_142'>  LORD BARDOLPH. As good as heart can wish.</a>
<a id='line_143'>    The King is almost wounded to the death;</a>
<a id='line_144'>    And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</a>
<a id='line_145'>    Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</a>
<a id='line_146'>    Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,</a>
<a id='line_147'>    And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;</a>
<a id='line_148'>    And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,</a>
<a id='line_149'>    Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day,</a>
<a id='line_150'>    So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,</a>
<a id='line_151'>    Came not till now to dignify the times,</a>
<a id='line_152'>    Since Cxsar's fortunes!</a>
<a id='line_153'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. How is this deriv'd?</a>
<a id='line_154'>    Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?</a>
<a id='line_155'>  LORD BARDOLPH. I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence;</a>
<a id='line_156'>    A gentleman well bred and of good name,</a>
<a id='line_157'>    That freely rend'red me these news for true.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>                         Enter TRAVERS</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent</a>
<a id='line_162'>    On Tuesday last to listen after news.</a>
<a id='line_163'>  LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I over-rode him on the way;</a>
<a id='line_164'>    And he is furnish'd with no certainties</a>
<a id='line_165'>    More than he haply may retail from me.</a>
<a id='line_166'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</a>
<a id='line_167'>  TRAVERS. My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back</a>
<a id='line_168'>    With joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</a>
<a id='line_170'>    A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</a>
<a id='line_171'>    That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</a>
<a id='line_172'>    He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</a>
<a id='line_173'>    I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.</a>
<a id='line_174'>    He told me that rebellion had bad luck,</a>
<a id='line_175'>    And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</a>
<a id='line_176'>    With that he gave his able horse the head</a>
<a id='line_177'>    And, bending forward, struck his armed heels</a>
<a id='line_178'>    Against the panting sides of his poor jade</a>
<a id='line_179'>    Up to the rowel-head; and starting so,</a>
<a id='line_180'>    He seem'd in running to devour the way,</a>
<a id='line_181'>    Staying no longer question.</a>
<a id='line_182'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Ha! Again:</a>
<a id='line_183'>    Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?</a>
<a id='line_184'>    Of Hotspur, Coldspur? that rebellion</a>
<a id='line_185'>    Had met ill luck?</a>
<a id='line_186'>  LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I'll tell you what:</a>
<a id='line_187'>    If my young lord your son have not the day,</a>
<a id='line_188'>    Upon mine honour, for a silken point</a>
<a id='line_189'>    I'll give my barony. Never talk of it.</a>
<a id='line_190'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</a>
<a id='line_191'>    Give then such instances of loss?</a>
<a id='line_192'>  LORD BARDOLPH. Who- he?</a>
<a id='line_193'>    He was some hilding fellow that had stol'n</a>
<a id='line_194'>    The horse he rode on and, upon my life,</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>                        Enter Morton</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,</a>
<a id='line_200'>    Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.</a>
<a id='line_201'>    So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</a>
<a id='line_202'>    Hath left a witness'd usurpation.</a>
<a id='line_203'>    Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</a>
<a id='line_204'>  MORTON. I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;</a>
<a id='line_205'>    Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</a>
<a id='line_206'>    To fright our party.</a>
<a id='line_207'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. How doth my son and brother?</a>
<a id='line_208'>    Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</a>
<a id='line_209'>    Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</a>
<a id='line_210'>    Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</a>
<a id='line_211'>    So dull, so dread in look, so woe-begone,</a>
<a id='line_212'>    Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night</a>
<a id='line_213'>    And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</a>
<a id='line_214'>    But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</a>
<a id='line_215'>    And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.</a>
<a id='line_216'>    This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus;</a>
<a id='line_217'>    Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'-</a>
<a id='line_218'>    Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;</a>
<a id='line_219'>    But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</a>
<a id='line_220'>    Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</a>
<a id='line_221'>    Ending with 'Brother, son, and all, are dead.'</a>
<a id='line_222'>  MORTON. Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;</a>
<a id='line_223'>    But for my lord your son-</a>
<a id='line_224'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, he is dead.</a>
<a id='line_225'>    See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</a>
<a id='line_226'>    He that but fears the thing he would not know</a>
<a id='line_227'>    Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes</a>
<a id='line_228'>    That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</a>
<a id='line_229'>    Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</a>
<a id='line_230'>    And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</a>
<a id='line_231'>    And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</a>
<a id='line_232'>  MORTON. You are too great to be by me gainsaid;</a>
<a id='line_233'>    Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</a>
<a id='line_234'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.</a>
<a id='line_235'>    I see a strange confession in thine eye;</a>
<a id='line_236'>    Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin</a>
<a id='line_237'>    To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so:</a>
<a id='line_238'>    The tongue offends not that reports his death;</a>
<a id='line_239'>    And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</a>
<a id='line_240'>    Not he which says the dead is not alive.</a>
<a id='line_241'>    Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</a>
<a id='line_242'>    Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</a>
<a id='line_243'>    Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</a>
<a id='line_244'>    Rememb'red tolling a departing friend.</a>
<a id='line_245'>  LORD BARDOLPH. I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</a>
<a id='line_246'>  MORTON. I am sorry I should force you to believe</a>
<a id='line_247'>    That which I would to God I had not seen;</a>
<a id='line_248'>    But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</a>
<a id='line_249'>    Rend'ring faint quittance, wearied and out-breath'd,</a>
<a id='line_250'>    To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</a>
<a id='line_251'>    The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_252'>    From whence with life he never more sprung up.</a>
<a id='line_253'>    In few, his death- whose spirit lent a fire</a>
<a id='line_254'>    Even to the dullest peasant in his camp-</a>
<a id='line_255'>    Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</a>
<a id='line_256'>    From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;</a>
<a id='line_257'>    For from his metal was his party steeled;</a>
<a id='line_258'>    Which once in him abated, an the rest</a>
<a id='line_259'>    Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</a>
<a id='line_260'>    And as the thing that's heavy in itself</a>
<a id='line_261'>    Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</a>
<a id='line_262'>    So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,</a>
<a id='line_263'>    Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</a>
<a id='line_264'>    That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</a>
<a id='line_265'>    Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</a>
<a id='line_266'>    Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester</a>
<a id='line_267'>    Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</a>
<a id='line_268'>    The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</a>
<a id='line_269'>    Had three times slain th' appearance of the King,</a>
<a id='line_270'>    Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</a>
<a id='line_271'>    Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,</a>
<a id='line_272'>    Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</a>
<a id='line_273'>    Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out</a>
<a id='line_274'>    A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_275'>    Under the conduct of young Lancaster</a>
<a id='line_276'>    And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</a>
<a id='line_277'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</a>
<a id='line_278'>    In poison there is physic; and these news,</a>
<a id='line_279'>    Having been well, that would have made me sick,</a>
<a id='line_280'>    Being sick, have in some measure made me well;</a>
<a id='line_281'>    And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,</a>
<a id='line_282'>    Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</a>
<a id='line_283'>    Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</a>
<a id='line_284'>    Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,</a>
<a id='line_285'>    Weak'ned with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,</a>
<a id='line_286'>    Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</a>
<a id='line_287'>    A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</a>
<a id='line_288'>    Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!</a>
<a id='line_289'>    Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</a>
<a id='line_290'>    Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.</a>
<a id='line_291'>    Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</a>
<a id='line_292'>    The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring</a>
<a id='line_293'>    To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland!</a>
<a id='line_294'>    Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature's hand</a>
<a id='line_295'>    Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!</a>
<a id='line_296'>    And let this world no longer be a stage</a>
<a id='line_297'>    To feed contention in a ling'ring act;</a>
<a id='line_298'>    But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</a>
<a id='line_299'>    Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</a>
<a id='line_300'>    On bloody courses, the rude scene may end</a>
<a id='line_301'>    And darkness be the burier of the dead!</a>
<a id='line_302'>  LORD BARDOLPH. This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_303'>  MORTON. Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.</a>
<a id='line_304'>    The lives of all your loving complices</a>
<a id='line_305'>    Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er</a>
<a id='line_306'>    To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</a>
<a id='line_307'>    You cast th' event of war, my noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_308'>    And summ'd the account of chance before you said</a>
<a id='line_309'>    'Let us make head.' It was your pre-surmise</a>
<a id='line_310'>    That in the dole of blows your son might drop.</a>
<a id='line_311'>    You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge,</a>

<a id='line_313'>    You were advis'd his flesh was capable</a>

<a id='line_316'>    Yet did you say 'Go forth'; and none of this,</a>

<a id='line_320'>    More than that being which was like to be?</a>
<a id='line_321'>  LORD BARDOLPH. We all that are engaged to this loss</a>

<a id='line_328'>  MORTON. 'Tis more than time. And, my most noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_329'>    I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:</a>
<a id='line_330'>    The gentle Archbishop of York is up</a>
<a id='line_331'>    With well-appointed pow'rs. He is a man</a>
<a id='line_332'>    Who with a double surety binds his followers.</a>
<a id='line_333'>    My lord your son had only but the corpse,</a>
<a id='line_334'>    But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</a>
<a id='line_335'>    For that same word 'rebellion' did divide</a>
<a id='line_336'>    The action of their bodies from their souls;</a>
<a id='line_337'>    And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,</a>
<a id='line_338'>    As men drink potions; that their weapons only</a>
<a id='line_339'>    Seem'd on our side, but for their spirits and souls</a>
<a id='line_340'>    This word 'rebellion'- it had froze them up,</a>
<a id='line_341'>    As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</a>
<a id='line_342'>    Turns insurrection to religion.</a>
<a id='line_343'>    Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_344'>    He's follow'd both with body and with mind;</a>

<a id='line_351'>  NORTHUMBERLAND. I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,</a>
<a id='line_352'>    This present grief had wip'd it from my mind.</a>
<a id='line_353'>    Go in with me; and counsel every man</a>
<a id='line_354'>    The aptest way for safety and revenge.</a>

<a id='line_360'>Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>  FALSTAFF. Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</a>
<a id='line_363'>  PAGE. He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water; but</a>
<a id='line_364'>    for the party that owed it, he might have moe diseases than he</a>
<a id='line_365'>    knew for.</a>
<a id='line_366'>  FALSTAFF. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of</a>
<a id='line_367'>    this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything</a>
<a id='line_368'>    that intends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented on</a>
<a id='line_369'>    me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in</a>
<a id='line_370'>    other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath</a>
<a id='line_371'>    overwhelm'd all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into</a>
<a id='line_372'>    my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I</a>
<a id='line_373'>    have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be</a>
<a id='line_374'>    worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann'd with</a>
<a id='line_375'>    an agate till now; but I will inset you neither in gold nor</a>
<a id='line_376'>    silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your</a>
<a id='line_377'>    master, for a jewel- the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose</a>

<a id='line_379'>    palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek; and yet he</a>
<a id='line_380'>    will not stick to say his face is a face-royal. God may finish it</a>
<a id='line_381'>    when he will, 'tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at</a>
<a id='line_382'>    a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it;</a>
<a id='line_383'>    and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his</a>
<a id='line_384'>    father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he's almost</a>
<a id='line_385'>    out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about</a>
<a id='line_386'>    the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</a>
<a id='line_387'>  PAGE. He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than</a>
<a id='line_388'>    Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours; he liked not the</a>

<a id='line_390'>  FALSTAFF. Let him be damn'd, like the Glutton; pray God his tongue</a>
<a id='line_391'>    be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascal-yea-forsooth knave, to</a>
<a id='line_392'>    bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The</a>
<a id='line_393'>    whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and</a>
<a id='line_394'>    bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through with</a>
<a id='line_395'>    them in honest taking-up, then they must stand upon security. I</a>
<a id='line_396'>    had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop</a>
<a id='line_397'>    it with security. I look'd 'a should have sent me two and twenty</a>
<a id='line_398'>    yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me security.</a>
<a id='line_399'>    Well, he may sleep in security; for he hath the horn of</a>
<a id='line_400'>    abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and</a>

<a id='line_413'>  an't please your lordship. CHIEF JUSTICE. He that was in question for</a>
<a id='line_414'>  the robb'ry? SERVANT. He, my lord; but he hath since done good</a>

<a id='line_416'>  to the Lord John of Lancaster. CHIEF JUSTICE. What, to York? Call him</a>
<a id='line_417'>  back again. SERVANT. Sir John Falstaff! FALSTAFF. Boy, tell him I am</a>
<a id='line_418'>  deaf. PAGE. You must speak louder; my master is deaf. CHIEF JUSTICE.</a>
<a id='line_419'>  I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good. Go, pluck him by</a>
<a id='line_420'>  the elbow; I must speak with him. SERVANT. Sir John! FALSTAFF. What!</a>
<a id='line_421'>  a young knave, and begging! Is there not wars? Is there not</a>
<a id='line_422'>  employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need</a>
<a id='line_423'>  soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse</a>
<a id='line_424'>  shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the</a>
<a id='line_425'>  name of rebellion can tell how to make it. SERVANT. You mistake me,</a>
<a id='line_426'>  sir. FALSTAFF. Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my</a>
<a id='line_427'>  knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had</a>
<a id='line_428'>  said so. SERVANT. I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your</a>
<a id='line_429'>  soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you you in your throat,</a>
<a id='line_430'>  if you say I am any other than an honest man. FALSTAFF. I give thee</a>
<a id='line_431'>  leave to tell me so! I lay aside that which grows to me! If thou</a>
<a id='line_432'>  get'st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak'st leave, thou wert</a>
<a id='line_433'>  better be hang'd. You hunt counter. Hence! Avaunt! SERVANT. Sir, my</a>
<a id='line_434'>  lord would speak with you. CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John Falstaff, a word</a>
<a id='line_435'>  with you. FALSTAFF. My good lord! God give your lordship good time of</a>
<a id='line_436'>  day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship</a>
<a id='line_437'>  was sick; I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship,</a>
<a id='line_438'>  though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in you,</a>
<a id='line_439'>  some relish of the saltness of time; and I most humbly beseech your</a>
<a id='line_440'>  lordship to have a reverend care of your health. CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir</a>
<a id='line_441'>  John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury. FALSTAFF.</a>
<a id='line_442'>  An't please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is return'd with some</a>
<a id='line_443'>  discomfort from Wales. CHIEF JUSTICE. I talk not of his Majesty. You</a>
<a id='line_444'>  would not come when I sent for you. FALSTAFF. And I hear, moreover,</a>
<a id='line_445'>  his Highness is fall'n into this same whoreson apoplexy. CHIEF</a>
<a id='line_446'>  JUSTICE. Well God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.</a>
<a id='line_447'>  FALSTAFF. This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an't</a>
<a id='line_448'>  please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson</a>
<a id='line_449'>  tingling. CHIEF JUSTICE. What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.</a>
<a id='line_450'>  FALSTAFF. It hath it original from much grief, from study, and</a>
<a id='line_451'>  perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in</a>
<a id='line_452'>  Galen; it is a kind of deafness. CHIEF JUSTICE. I think you are</a>
<a id='line_453'>  fall'n into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.</a>
<a id='line_454'>  FALSTAFF. Very well, my lord, very well. Rather an't please you, it</a>
<a id='line_455'>  is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am</a>
<a id='line_456'>  troubled withal. CHIEF JUSTICE. To punish you by the heels would</a>
<a id='line_457'>  amend the attention of your ears; and I care not if I do become your</a>
<a id='line_458'>  physician. FALSTAFF. I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so</a>
<a id='line_459'>  patient. Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me</a>
<a id='line_460'>  in respect of poverty; but how I should be your patient to follow</a>
<a id='line_461'>  your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or</a>
<a id='line_462'>  indeed a scruple itself. CHIEF JUSTICE. I sent for you, when there</a>
<a id='line_463'>  were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.</a>
<a id='line_464'>  FALSTAFF. As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws of</a>
<a id='line_465'>  this land-service, I did not come. CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the truth is,</a>
<a id='line_466'>  Sir John, you live in great infamy. FALSTAFF. He that buckles himself</a>
<a id='line_467'>  in my belt cannot live in less. CHIEF JUSTICE. Your means are very</a>
<a id='line_468'>  slender, and your waste is great. FALSTAFF. I would it were</a>
<a id='line_469'>  otherwise; I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer.</a>
<a id='line_470'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. You have misled the youthful Prince. FALSTAFF. The</a>
<a id='line_471'>  young Prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the great belly,</a>
<a id='line_472'>  and he my dog. CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd</a>
<a id='line_473'>  wound. Your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over</a>
<a id='line_474'>  your night's exploit on Gadshill. You may thank th' unquiet time for</a>
<a id='line_475'>  your quiet o'erposting that action. FALSTAFF. My lord- CHIEF JUSTICE.</a>
<a id='line_476'>  But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a sleeping wolf.</a>
<a id='line_477'>  FALSTAFF. To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox. CHIEF JUSTICE.</a>
<a id='line_478'>  What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt out. FALSTAFF. A</a>
<a id='line_479'>  wassail candle, my lord- all tallow; if I did say of wax, my growth</a>
<a id='line_480'>  would approve the truth. CHIEF JUSTICE. There is not a white hair in</a>
<a id='line_481'>  your face but should have his effect of gravity. FALSTAFF. His effect</a>
<a id='line_482'>  of gravy, gravy, CHIEF JUSTICE. You follow the young Prince up and</a>
<a id='line_483'>  down, like his ill angel. FALSTAFF. Not so, my lord. Your ill angel</a>
<a id='line_484'>  is light; but  hope he that looks upon me will take me without</a>
<a id='line_485'>  weighing. And yet in some respects, I grant, I cannot go- I cannot</a>
<a id='line_486'>  tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers' times</a>
<a id='line_487'>  that true valour is turn'd berod; pregnancy is made a tapster, and</a>
<a id='line_488'>  his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts</a>
<a id='line_489'>  appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not</a>
<a id='line_490'>  worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of</a>
<a id='line_491'>  us that are young; you do measure the heat of our livers with the</a>
<a id='line_492'>  bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth,</a>
<a id='line_493'>  must confess, are wags too. CHIEF JUSTICE. Do you set down your name</a>
<a id='line_494'>  in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the</a>
<a id='line_495'>  characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow</a>
<a id='line_496'>  cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not</a>
<a id='line_497'>  your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit</a>
<a id='line_498'>  single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you</a>
<a id='line_499'>  yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John! FALSTAFF. My lord,</a>
<a id='line_500'>  I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white</a>
<a id='line_501'>  head and something a round belly. For my voice- I have lost it with</a>
<a id='line_502'>  hallooing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will</a>
<a id='line_503'>  not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and</a>
<a id='line_504'>  he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</a>
<a id='line_505'>  money, and have at him. For the box of the ear that the Prince gave</a>
<a id='line_506'>  you- he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible</a>
<a id='line_507'>  lord. I have check'd him for it; and the young lion repents- marry,</a>
<a id='line_508'>  not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack. CHIEF</a>
<a id='line_509'>  JUSTICE. Well, God send the Prince a better companion! FALSTAFF. God</a>
<a id='line_510'>  send the companion a better prince! I cannot rid my hands of him.</a>
<a id='line_511'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the King hath sever'd you. I hear you are going</a>
<a id='line_512'>  with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of</a>
<a id='line_513'>  Northumberland. FALSTAFF. Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it.</a>
<a id='line_514'>  But look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our</a>
<a id='line_515'>  armies join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts</a>
<a id='line_516'>  out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot</a>
<a id='line_517'>  day, and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I might never spit</a>
<a id='line_518'>  white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head</a>
<a id='line_519'>  but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever; but it was alway</a>
<a id='line_520'>  yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to</a>
<a id='line_521'>  make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should</a>
<a id='line_522'>  give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the</a>
<a id='line_523'>  enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than</a>
<a id='line_524'>  to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion. CHIEF JUSTICE. Well,</a>
<a id='line_525'>  be honest, be honest; and God bless your expedition! FALSTAFF. Will</a>
<a id='line_526'>  your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth? CHIEF</a>
<a id='line_527'>  JUSTICE. Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to bear</a>
<a id='line_528'>  crosses. Fare you well. Commend me to my cousin Westmoreland. Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_529'>  CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT FALSTAFF. If I do, fillip me with a</a>
<a id='line_530'>  three-man beetle. A man can no more separate age and covetousness</a>
<a id='line_531'>  than 'a can part young limbs and lechery; but the gout galls the one,</a>
<a id='line_532'>  and the pox pinches the other; and so both the degrees prevent my</a>
<a id='line_533'>  curses. Boy! PAGE. Sir? FALSTAFF. What money is in my purse? PAGE.</a>
<a id='line_534'>  Seven groats and two pence. FALSTAFF. I can get no remedy against</a>
<a id='line_535'>  this consumption of the purse; borrowing only lingers and lingers it</a>
<a id='line_536'>  out, but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter to my Lord of</a>
<a id='line_537'>  Lancaster; this to the Prince; this to the Earl of Westmoreland; and</a>
<a id='line_538'>  this to old Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry since</a>
<a id='line_539'>  I perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin. About it; you know where</a>

<a id='line_553'>    Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes-</a>

<a id='line_555'>  MOWBRAY. I well allow the occasion of our amis;</a>

<a id='line_557'>    How, in our means, we should advance ourselves</a>

<a id='line_564'>    With an incensed fire of injuries.</a>
<a id='line_565'>  LORD BARDOLPH. The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:</a>
<a id='line_566'>    Whether our present five and twenty thousand</a>
<a id='line_567'>    May hold up head without Northumberland?</a>

<a id='line_580'>    Flatt'ring himself in project of a power</a>
<a id='line_581'>    Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;</a>
<a id='line_582'>    And so, with great imagination</a>
<a id='line_583'>    Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,</a>
<a id='line_584'>    And, winking, leapt into destruction.</a>
<a id='line_585'>  HASTINGS. But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt</a>
<a id='line_586'>    To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</a>
<a id='line_587'>  LORD BARDOLPH. Yes, if this present quality of war-</a>
<a id='line_588'>    Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot-</a>
<a id='line_589'>    Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</a>
<a id='line_590'>    We see th' appearing buds; which to prove fruit</a>
<a id='line_591'>    Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair</a>
<a id='line_592'>    That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</a>
<a id='line_593'>    We first survey the plot, then draw the model;</a>
<a id='line_594'>    And when we see the figure of the house,</a>
<a id='line_595'>    Then we must rate the cost of the erection;</a>
<a id='line_596'>    Which if we find outweighs ability,</a>
<a id='line_597'>    What do we then but draw anew the model</a>
<a id='line_598'>    In fewer offices, or at least desist</a>
<a id='line_599'>    To build at all? Much more, in this great work-</a>
<a id='line_600'>    Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</a>
<a id='line_601'>    And set another up- should we survey</a>
<a id='line_602'>    The plot of situation and the model,</a>
<a id='line_603'>    Consent upon a sure foundation,</a>
<a id='line_604'>    Question surveyors, know our own estate</a>
<a id='line_605'>    How able such a work to undergo-</a>
<a id='line_606'>    To weigh against his opposite; or else</a>
<a id='line_607'>    We fortify in paper and in figures,</a>
<a id='line_608'>    Using the names of men instead of men;</a>
<a id='line_609'>    Like one that draws the model of a house</a>
<a id='line_610'>    Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,</a>
<a id='line_611'>    Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost</a>
<a id='line_612'>    A naked subject to the weeping clouds</a>
<a id='line_613'>    And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.</a>
<a id='line_614'>  HASTINGS. Grant that our hopes- yet likely of fair birth-</a>
<a id='line_615'>    Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd</a>
<a id='line_616'>    The utmost man of expectation,</a>
<a id='line_617'>    I think we are so a body strong enough,</a>
<a id='line_618'>    Even as we are, to equal with the King.</a>
<a id='line_619'>  LORD BARDOLPH. What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?</a>
<a id='line_620'>  HASTINGS. To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph;</a>
<a id='line_621'>    For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</a>
<a id='line_622'>    Are in three heads: one power against the French,</a>
<a id='line_623'>    And one against Glendower; perforce a third</a>
<a id='line_624'>    Must take up us. So is the unfirm King</a>
<a id='line_625'>    In three divided; and his coffers sound</a>
<a id='line_626'>    With hollow poverty and emptiness.</a>
<a id='line_627'>  ARCHBISHOP. That he should draw his several strengths together</a>
<a id='line_628'>    And come against us in full puissance</a>

<a id='line_630'>  HASTINGS. If he should do so,</a>
<a id='line_631'>    He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh</a>

<a id='line_729'>    Stand from him, fellow; wherefore hang'st thou upon him?</a>
<a id='line_730'>  HOSTESS. O My most worshipful lord, an't please your Grace, I am a</a>

<a id='line_733'>  HOSTESS. It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all- all I</a>

<a id='line_736'>    out again, or I will ride thee a nights like a mare.</a>
<a id='line_737'>  FALSTAFF. I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have any</a>

<a id='line_739'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good</a>
<a id='line_740'>    temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not</a>

<a id='line_742'>    her own?</a>
<a id='line_743'>  FALSTAFF. What is the gross sum that I owe thee?</a>
<a id='line_744'>  HOSTESS. Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money</a>
<a id='line_745'>    too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in</a>
<a id='line_746'>    my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon</a>
<a id='line_747'>    Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for</a>
<a id='line_748'>    liking his father to singing-man of Windsor- thou didst swear to</a>
<a id='line_749'>    me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my</a>
<a id='line_750'>    lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the</a>
<a id='line_751'>    butcher's wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly? Coming</a>
<a id='line_752'>    in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish of</a>
<a id='line_753'>    prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told</a>
<a id='line_754'>    thee they were ill for green wound? And didst thou not, when she</a>
<a id='line_755'>    was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with</a>
<a id='line_756'>    such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me madam?</a>
<a id='line_757'>    And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch the thirty</a>
<a id='line_758'>    shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it, if thou</a>
<a id='line_759'>    canst.</a>
<a id='line_760'>  FALSTAFF. My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and</a>
<a id='line_761'>    down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in</a>

<a id='line_763'>    for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress</a>
<a id='line_764'>    against them.</a>
<a id='line_765'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your</a>
<a id='line_766'>    manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a</a>
<a id='line_767'>    confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more</a>
<a id='line_768'>    than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level</a>
<a id='line_769'>    consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practis'd upon the</a>
<a id='line_770'>    easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses</a>
<a id='line_771'>    both in purse and in person.</a>
<a id='line_772'>  HOSTESS. Yea, in truth, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_773'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and</a>
<a id='line_774'>    unpay the villainy you have done with her; the one you may do</a>
<a id='line_775'>    with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.</a>
<a id='line_776'>  FALSTAFF. My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You</a>
<a id='line_777'>    call honourable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will make</a>
<a id='line_778'>    curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble</a>
<a id='line_779'>    duty rememb'red, I will not be your suitor. I say to you I do</a>
<a id='line_780'>    desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty</a>
<a id='line_781'>    employment in the King's affairs.</a>
<a id='line_782'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in</a>

<a id='line_857'>    indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my</a>
<a id='line_858'>    greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or</a>
<a id='line_859'>    to know thy face to-morrow, or to take note how many pair of silk</a>
<a id='line_860'>    stockings thou hast- viz., these, and those that were thy</a>
<a id='line_861'>    peach-colour'd ones- or to bear the inventory of thy shirts- as,</a>
<a id='line_862'>    one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the</a>
<a id='line_863'>    tennis-court-keeper knows better than I; for it is a low ebb of</a>
<a id='line_864'>    linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast</a>
<a id='line_865'>    not done a great while, because the rest of thy low countries</a>
<a id='line_866'>    have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether</a>
<a id='line_867'>    those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his</a>
<a id='line_868'>    kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault;</a>
<a id='line_869'>    whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily</a>
<a id='line_870'>    strengthened.</a>
<a id='line_871'>  POINS. How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, you</a>
<a id='line_872'>    should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would</a>
<a id='line_873'>    do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?</a>
<a id='line_874'>  PRINCE. Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</a>
<a id='line_875'>  POINS. Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.</a>
<a id='line_876'>  PRINCE. It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</a>
<a id='line_877'>  POINS. Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you will</a>
<a id='line_878'>    tell.</a>
<a id='line_879'>  PRINCE. Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now</a>
<a id='line_880'>    my father is sick; albeit I could tell to thee- as to one it</a>
<a id='line_881'>    pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend- I could be</a>
<a id='line_882'>    sad and sad indeed too.</a>
<a id='line_883'>  POINS. Very hardly upon such a subject.</a>
<a id='line_884'>  PRINCE. By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book</a>
<a id='line_885'>    as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency: let the end</a>
<a id='line_886'>    try the man. But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my</a>
<a id='line_887'>    father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath</a>
<a id='line_888'>    in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</a>
<a id='line_889'>  POINS. The reason?</a>
<a id='line_890'>  PRINCE. What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?</a>
<a id='line_891'>  POINS. I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</a>
<a id='line_892'>  PRINCE. It would be every man's thought; and thou art a blessed</a>
<a id='line_893'>    fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man's thought in the</a>
<a id='line_894'>    world keeps the road-way better than thine. Every man would think</a>
<a id='line_895'>    me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful</a>
<a id='line_896'>    thought to think so?</a>
<a id='line_897'>  POINS. Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to</a>
<a id='line_898'>    Falstaff.</a>
<a id='line_899'>  PRINCE. And to thee.</a>
<a id='line_900'>  POINS. By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it with mine</a>

<a id='line_1664'>    your good hand, give me your worship's good hand. By my troth,</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    you like well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good Sir</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    John.</a>
<a id='line_1667'>  FALSTAFF. I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1668'>    Master Surecard, as I think?</a>
<a id='line_1669'>  SHALLOW. No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with</a>
<a id='line_1670'>   me.</a>
<a id='line_1671'>  FALSTAFF. Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the</a>
<a id='line_1672'>    peace.</a>
<a id='line_1673'>  SILENCE. Your good worship is welcome.</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  FALSTAFF. Fie! this is hot weather. Gentlemen, have you provided me</a>
<a id='line_1675'>    here half a dozen sufficient men?</a>
<a id='line_1676'>  SHALLOW. Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?</a>
<a id='line_1677'>  FALSTAFF. Let me see them, I beseech you.</a>
<a id='line_1678'>  SHALLOW. Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Let</a>
<a id='line_1679'>    me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so,- so, so- yea,</a>
<a id='line_1680'>    marry, sir. Rafe Mouldy! Let them appear as I call; let them do</a>
<a id='line_1681'>    so, let them do so. Let me see; where is Mouldy?</a>
<a id='line_1682'>  MOULDY. Here, an't please you.</a>
<a id='line_1683'>  SHALLOW. What think you, Sir John? A good-limb'd fellow; young,</a>
<a id='line_1684'>    strong, and of good friends.</a>
<a id='line_1685'>  FALSTAFF. Is thy name Mouldy?</a>
<a id='line_1686'>  MOULDY. Yea, an't please you.</a>
<a id='line_1687'>  FALSTAFF. 'Tis the more time thou wert us'd.</a>
<a id='line_1688'>  SHALLOW. Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that are</a>
<a id='line_1689'>    mouldy lack use. Very singular good! In faith, well said, Sir</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    John; very well said.</a>
<a id='line_1691'>  FALSTAFF. Prick him.</a>
<a id='line_1692'>  MOULDY. I was prick'd well enough before, an you could have let me</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    alone. My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    and her drudgery. You need not to have prick'd me; there are</a>
<a id='line_1695'>    other men fitter to go out than I.</a>
<a id='line_1696'>  FALSTAFF. Go to; peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is time</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    you were spent.</a>
<a id='line_1698'>  MOULDY. Spent!</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  SHALLOW. Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside; know you where you are?</a>
<a id='line_1700'>    For th' other, Sir John- let me see. Simon Shadow!</a>
<a id='line_1701'>  FALSTAFF. Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under. He's like to be</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    a cold soldier.</a>
<a id='line_1703'>  SHALLOW. Where's Shadow?</a>
<a id='line_1704'>  SHADOW. Here, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1705'>  FALSTAFF. Shadow, whose son art thou?</a>
<a id='line_1706'>  SHADOW. My mother's son, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1707'>  FALSTAFF. Thy mother's son! Like enough; and thy father's shadow.</a>
<a id='line_1708'>    So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is often</a>
<a id='line_1709'>    so indeed; but much of the father's substance!</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  SHALLOW. Do you like him, Sir John?</a>
<a id='line_1711'>  FALSTAFF. Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him; for we have a</a>
<a id='line_1712'>    number of shadows fill up the muster-book.</a>
<a id='line_1713'>  SHALLOW. Thomas Wart!</a>
<a id='line_1714'>  FALSTAFF. Where's he?</a>
<a id='line_1715'>  WART. Here, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1716'>  FALSTAFF. Is thy name Wart?</a>
<a id='line_1717'>  WART. Yea, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1718'>  FALSTAFF. Thou art a very ragged wart.</a>
<a id='line_1719'>  SHALLOW. Shall I prick him, Sir John?</a>
<a id='line_1720'>  FALSTAFF. It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon his</a>
<a id='line_1721'>    back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more.</a>
<a id='line_1722'>  SHALLOW. Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir; you can do it. I commend</a>
<a id='line_1723'>    you well. Francis Feeble!</a>
<a id='line_1724'>  FEEBLE. Here, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1725'>  FALSTAFF. What trade art thou, Feeble?</a>
<a id='line_1726'>  FEEBLE. A woman's tailor, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1727'>  SHALLOW. Shall I prick him, sir?</a>
<a id='line_1728'>  FALSTAFF. You may; but if he had been a man's tailor, he'd ha'</a>
<a id='line_1729'>    prick'd you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as</a>
<a id='line_1730'>    thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?</a>
<a id='line_1731'>  FEEBLE. I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.</a>
<a id='line_1732'>  FALSTAFF. Well said, good woman's tailor! well said, courageous</a>
<a id='line_1733'>    Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most</a>
<a id='line_1734'>    magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman's tailor- well, Master</a>
<a id='line_1735'>    Shallow, deep, Master Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1736'>  FEEBLE. I would Wart might have gone, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1737'>  FALSTAFF. I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst mend</a>
<a id='line_1738'>    him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private</a>
<a id='line_1739'>    soldier, that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that</a>
<a id='line_1740'>    suffice, most forcible Feeble.</a>
<a id='line_1741'>  FEEBLE. It shall suffice, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1742'>  FALSTAFF. I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?</a>
<a id='line_1743'>  SHALLOW. Peter Bullcalf o' th' green!</a>
<a id='line_1744'>  FALSTAFF. Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.</a>
<a id='line_1745'>  BULLCALF. Here, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  FALSTAFF. Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf till</a>
<a id='line_1747'>    he roar again.</a>
<a id='line_1748'>  BULLCALF. O Lord! good my lord captain-</a>
<a id='line_1749'>  FALSTAFF. What, dost thou roar before thou art prick'd?</a>
<a id='line_1750'>  BULLCALF. O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.</a>
<a id='line_1751'>  FALSTAFF. What disease hast thou?</a>
<a id='line_1752'>  BULLCALF. A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with</a>
<a id='line_1753'>    ringing in the King's affairs upon his coronation day, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1754'>  FALSTAFF. Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We will have</a>
<a id='line_1755'>    away thy cold; and I will take such order that thy friends shall</a>
<a id='line_1756'>    ring for thee. Is here all?</a>
<a id='line_1757'>  SHALLOW. Here is two more call'd than your number. You must have</a>
<a id='line_1758'>    but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.</a>
<a id='line_1759'>  FALSTAFF. Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry</a>
<a id='line_1760'>    dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  SHALLOW. O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the</a>
<a id='line_1762'>    windmill in Saint George's Field?</a>
<a id='line_1763'>  FALSTAFF. No more of that, Master Shallow, no more of that.</a>
<a id='line_1764'>  SHALLOW. Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?</a>
<a id='line_1765'>  FALSTAFF. She lives, Master Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1766'>  SHALLOW. She never could away with me.</a>
<a id='line_1767'>  FALSTAFF. Never, never; she would always say she could not abide</a>
<a id='line_1768'>    Master Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1769'>  SHALLOW. By the mass, I could anger her to th' heart. She was then</a>
<a id='line_1770'>    a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?</a>
<a id='line_1771'>  FALSTAFF. Old, old, Master Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1772'>  SHALLOW. Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;</a>
<a id='line_1773'>    certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork, by old Nightwork,</a>
<a id='line_1774'>    before I came to Clement's Inn.</a>
<a id='line_1775'>  SILENCE. That's fifty-five year ago.</a>
<a id='line_1776'>  SHALLOW. Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this</a>
<a id='line_1777'>    knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?</a>
<a id='line_1778'>  FALSTAFF. We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.</a>
<a id='line_1779'>  SHALLOW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir</a>
<a id='line_1780'>    John, we have. Our watchword was 'Hem, boys!' Come, let's to</a>
<a id='line_1781'>    dinner; come, let's to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have seen!</a>
<a id='line_1782'>    Come, come.</a>
<a id='line_1783'>                                Exeunt FALSTAFF and the JUSTICES</a>
<a id='line_1784'>  BULLCALF. Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend; and</a>
<a id='line_1785'>    here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you. In very</a>
<a id='line_1786'>    truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd, sir, as go. And yet, for</a>
<a id='line_1787'>    mine own part, sir, I do not care; but rather because I am</a>
<a id='line_1788'>    unwilling and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my</a>
<a id='line_1789'>    friends; else, sir, I did not care for mine own part so much.</a>
<a id='line_1790'>  BARDOLPH. Go to; stand aside.</a>
<a id='line_1791'>  MOULDY. And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's sake,</a>
<a id='line_1792'>    stand my friend. She has nobody to do anything about her when I</a>

<a id='line_1794'>    forty, sir.</a>
<a id='line_1795'>  BARDOLPH. Go to; stand aside.</a>
<a id='line_1796'>  FEEBLE. By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God</a>

<a id='line_1807'>  SHALLOW. Four of which you please.</a>
<a id='line_1808'>  BARDOLPH. Sir, a word with you. I have three pound to free Mouldy</a>

<a id='line_1810'>  FALSTAFF. Go to; well.</a>
<a id='line_1811'>  SHALLOW. Come, Sir John, which four will you have?</a>
<a id='line_1812'>  FALSTAFF. Do you choose for me.</a>
<a id='line_1813'>  SHALLOW. Marry, then- Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.</a>
<a id='line_1814'>  FALSTAFF. Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home till</a>

<a id='line_1816'>    unto it. I will none of you.</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  SHALLOW. Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your</a>
<a id='line_1818'>    likeliest men, and I would have you serv'd with the best.</a>
<a id='line_1819'>  FALSTAFF. Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man?</a>
<a id='line_1820'>    Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big</a>
<a id='line_1821'>    assemblance of a man! Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here's</a>
<a id='line_1822'>    Wart; you see what a ragged appearance it is. 'A shall charge you</a>

<a id='line_1824'>    off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer's bucket.</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    And this same half-fac'd fellow, Shadow- give me this man. He</a>
<a id='line_1826'>    presents no mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim</a>
<a id='line_1827'>    level at the edge of a penknife. And, for a retreat- how swiftly</a>
<a id='line_1828'>    will this Feeble, the woman's tailor, run off! O, give me the</a>
<a id='line_1829'>    spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into</a>

<a id='line_1831'>  BARDOLPH. Hold, Wart. Traverse- thus, thus, thus.</a>
<a id='line_1832'>  FALSTAFF. Come, manage me your caliver. So- very well. Go to; very</a>

<a id='line_1835'>    Hold, there's a tester for thee.</a>
<a id='line_1836'>  SHALLOW. He is not his craft's master, he doth not do it right. I</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at Clement's Inn- I was</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show- there was a little quiver</a>
<a id='line_1839'>    fellow, and 'a would manage you his piece thus; and 'a would</a>

<a id='line_1843'>  FALSTAFF. These fellows will do well. Master Shallow, God keep you!</a>

<a id='line_1851'>  FALSTAFF. Fore God, would you would.</a>
<a id='line_1852'>  SHALLOW. Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.</a>

<a id='line_1854'>    Bardolph; lead the men away.  [Exeunt all but FALSTAFF]  As I</a>
<a id='line_1855'>    return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of</a>
<a id='line_1856'>    justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this</a>
<a id='line_1857'>    vice of lying! This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but</a>
<a id='line_1858'>    prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath</a>
<a id='line_1859'>    done about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer paid</a>
<a id='line_1860'>    to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember him at</a>
<a id='line_1861'>    Clement's Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring.</a>
<a id='line_1862'>    When 'a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork'd radish,</a>
<a id='line_1863'>    with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. 'A was so</a>
<a id='line_1864'>    forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. 'A</a>
<a id='line_1865'>    was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    whores call'd him mandrake. 'A came ever in the rearward of the</a>
<a id='line_1867'>    fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that</a>
<a id='line_1868'>    he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire,</a>
<a id='line_1870'>    and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn</a>
<a id='line_1871'>    brother to him; and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in</a>
<a id='line_1872'>    the Tiltyard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    name; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an</a>
<a id='line_1875'>    eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    court- and now has he land and beeves. Well, I'll be acquainted</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    with him if I return; and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap</a>
<a id='line_1880'>    at him. Let time shape, and there an end.               Exit</a>

<a id='line_1928'>    Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    And countenanc'd by boys and beggary-</a>
<a id='line_1930'>    I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd</a>
<a id='line_1931'>    In his true, native, and most proper shape,</a>
<a id='line_1932'>    You, reverend father, and these noble lords,</a>
<a id='line_1933'>    Had not been here to dress the ugly form</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    Of base and bloody insurrection</a>
<a id='line_1935'>    With your fair honours. You, Lord Archbishop,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>    Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    Whose white investments figure innocence,</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace-</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace,</a>
<a id='line_1943'>    Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war;</a>
<a id='line_1944'>    Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    To a loud trumpet and a point of war?</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  ARCHBISHOP. Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</a>
<a id='line_1950'>    Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    And we must bleed for it; of which disease</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    Our late King, Richard, being infected, died.</a>
<a id='line_1953'>    But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    I take not on me here as a physician;</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    Nor do I as an enemy to peace</a>
<a id='line_1956'>    Troop in the throngs of military men;</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    But rather show awhile like fearful war</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    To diet rank minds sick of happiness,</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop</a>
<a id='line_1960'>    Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</a>
<a id='line_1962'>    What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</a>
<a id='line_1963'>    And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    We see which way the stream of time doth run</a>
<a id='line_1965'>    And are enforc'd from our most quiet there</a>
<a id='line_1966'>    By the rough torrent of occasion;</a>
<a id='line_1967'>    And have the summary of all our griefs,</a>
<a id='line_1968'>    When time shall serve, to show in articles;</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,</a>
<a id='line_1970'>    And might by no suit gain our audience:</a>
<a id='line_1971'>    When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,</a>
<a id='line_1972'>    We are denied access unto his person,</a>
<a id='line_1973'>    Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</a>
<a id='line_1974'>    The dangers of the days but newly gone,</a>
<a id='line_1975'>    Whose memory is written on the earth</a>
<a id='line_1976'>    With yet appearing blood, and the examples</a>
<a id='line_1977'>    Of every minute's instance, present now,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>    Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms;</a>
<a id='line_1979'>    Not to break peace, or any branch of it,</a>
<a id='line_1980'>    But to establish here a peace indeed,</a>
<a id='line_1981'>    Concurring both in name and quality.</a>
<a id='line_1982'>  WESTMORELAND. When ever yet was your appeal denied;</a>
<a id='line_1983'>    Wherein have you been galled by the King;</a>
<a id='line_1984'>    What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you</a>
<a id='line_1985'>    That you should seal this lawless bloody book</a>
<a id='line_1986'>    Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine,</a>
<a id='line_1987'>    And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  ARCHBISHOP. My brother general, the commonwealth,</a>
<a id='line_1989'>    To brother horn an household cruelty,</a>
<a id='line_1990'>    I make my quarrel in particular.</a>
<a id='line_1991'>  WESTMORELAND. There is no need of any such redress;</a>
<a id='line_1992'>    Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</a>
<a id='line_1993'>  MOWBRAY. Why not to him in part, and to us all</a>
<a id='line_1994'>    That feel the bruises of the days before,</a>
<a id='line_1995'>    And suffer the condition of these times</a>
<a id='line_1996'>    To lay a heavy and unequal hand</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    Upon our honours?</a>
<a id='line_1998'>  WESTMORELAND. O my good Lord Mowbray,</a>
<a id='line_1999'>    Construe the times to their necessities,</a>
<a id='line_2000'>    And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>    And not the King, that doth you injuries.</a>
<a id='line_2002'>    Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>    Either from the King or in the present time,</a>
<a id='line_2004'>    That you should have an inch of any ground</a>
<a id='line_2005'>    To build a grief on. Were you not restor'd</a>
<a id='line_2006'>    To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories,</a>
<a id='line_2007'>    Your noble and right well-rememb'red father's?</a>
<a id='line_2008'>  MOWBRAY. What thing, in honour, had my father lost</a>
<a id='line_2009'>    That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me?</a>
<a id='line_2010'>    The King that lov'd him, as the state stood then,</a>
<a id='line_2011'>    Was force perforce compell'd to banish him,</a>
<a id='line_2012'>    And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,</a>
<a id='line_2013'>    Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</a>
<a id='line_2014'>    Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</a>
<a id='line_2015'>    Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</a>
<a id='line_2016'>    Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,</a>
<a id='line_2017'>    And the loud trumpet blowing them together-</a>
<a id='line_2018'>    Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd</a>
<a id='line_2019'>    My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</a>
<a id='line_2020'>    O, when the King did throw his warder down-</a>
<a id='line_2021'>    His own life hung upon the staff he threw-</a>
<a id='line_2022'>    Then threw he down himself, and all their lives</a>
<a id='line_2023'>    That by indictment and by dint of sword</a>
<a id='line_2024'>    Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</a>
<a id='line_2025'>  WESTMORELAND. You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</a>
<a id='line_2026'>    The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</a>
<a id='line_2027'>    In England the most valiant gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_2028'>    Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd?</a>
<a id='line_2029'>    But if your father had been victor there,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>    He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry;</a>
<a id='line_2031'>    For all the country, in a general voice,</a>
<a id='line_2032'>    Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on,</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King.</a>
<a id='line_2035'>    But this is mere digression from my purpose.</a>
<a id='line_2036'>    Here come I from our princely general</a>
<a id='line_2037'>    To know your griefs; to tell you from his Grace</a>
<a id='line_2038'>    That he will give you audience; and wherein</a>
<a id='line_2039'>    It shall appear that your demands are just,</a>
<a id='line_2040'>    You shall enjoy them, everything set off</a>
<a id='line_2041'>    That might so much as think you enemies.</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  MOWBRAY. But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer;</a>
<a id='line_2043'>    And it proceeds from policy, not love.</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  WESTMORELAND. Mowbray. you overween to take it so.</a>
<a id='line_2045'>    This offer comes from mercy, not from fear;</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    For, lo! within a ken our army lies-</a>
<a id='line_2047'>    Upon mine honour, all too confident</a>
<a id='line_2048'>    To give admittance to a thought of fear.</a>
<a id='line_2049'>    Our battle is more full of names than yours,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>    Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</a>
<a id='line_2051'>    Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</a>
<a id='line_2052'>    Then reason will our hearts should be as good.</a>
<a id='line_2053'>    Say you not, then, our offer is compell'd.</a>
<a id='line_2054'>  MOWBRAY. Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  WESTMORELAND. That argues but the shame of your offence:</a>
<a id='line_2056'>    A rotten case abides no handling.</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  HASTINGS. Hath the Prince John a full commission,</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    In very ample virtue of his father,</a>
<a id='line_2059'>    To hear and absolutely to determine</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</a>
<a id='line_2061'>  WESTMORELAND. That is intended in the general's name.</a>
<a id='line_2062'>    I muse you make so slight a question.</a>
<a id='line_2063'>  ARCHBISHOP. Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,</a>
<a id='line_2064'>    For this contains our general grievances.</a>
<a id='line_2065'>    Each several article herein redress'd,</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    All members of our cause, both here and hence,</a>
<a id='line_2067'>    That are insinewed to this action,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>    Acquitted by a true substantial form,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>    And present execution of our wills</a>
<a id='line_2070'>    To us and to our purposes confin'd-</a>
<a id='line_2071'>    We come within our awful banks again,</a>
<a id='line_2072'>    And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</a>
<a id='line_2073'>  WESTMORELAND. This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    In sight of both our battles we may meet;</a>
<a id='line_2075'>    And either end in peace- which God so frame!-</a>
<a id='line_2076'>    Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords</a>
<a id='line_2077'>    Which must decide it.</a>
<a id='line_2078'>  ARCHBISHOP. My lord, we will do so.          Exit WESTMORELAND</a>
<a id='line_2079'>  MOWBRAY. There is a thing within my bosom tells me</a>
<a id='line_2080'>    That no conditions of our peace can stand.</a>
<a id='line_2081'>  HASTINGS. Fear you not that: if we can make our peace</a>
<a id='line_2082'>    Upon such large terms and so absolute</a>
<a id='line_2083'>    As our conditions shall consist upon,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>    Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</a>
<a id='line_2085'>  MOWBRAY. Yea, but our valuation shall be such</a>
<a id='line_2086'>    That every slight and false-derived cause,</a>
<a id='line_2087'>    Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>    Shall to the King taste of this action;</a>
<a id='line_2089'>    That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>    We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind</a>
<a id='line_2091'>    That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,</a>
<a id='line_2092'>    And good from bad find no partition.</a>
<a id='line_2093'>  ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary</a>
<a id='line_2094'>    Of dainty and such picking grievances;</a>
<a id='line_2095'>    For he hath found to end one doubt by death</a>
<a id='line_2096'>    Revives two greater in the heirs of life;</a>
<a id='line_2097'>    And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,</a>
<a id='line_2098'>    And keep no tell-tale to his memory</a>
<a id='line_2099'>    That may repeat and history his los</a>
<a id='line_2100'>    To new remembrance. For full well he knows</a>
<a id='line_2101'>    He cannot so precisely weed this land</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    As his misdoubts present occasion:</a>
<a id='line_2103'>    His foes are so enrooted with his friends</a>
<a id='line_2104'>    That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</a>
<a id='line_2105'>    He doth unfasten so and shake a friend.</a>
<a id='line_2106'>    So that this land, like an offensive wife</a>
<a id='line_2107'>    That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes,</a>
<a id='line_2108'>    As he is striking, holds his infant up,</a>
<a id='line_2109'>    And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm</a>
<a id='line_2110'>    That was uprear'd to execution.</a>
<a id='line_2111'>  HASTINGS. Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods</a>
<a id='line_2112'>    On late offenders, that he now doth lack</a>
<a id='line_2113'>    The very instruments of chastisement;</a>
<a id='line_2114'>    So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</a>
<a id='line_2115'>    May offer, but not hold.</a>
<a id='line_2116'>  ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true;</a>
<a id='line_2117'>    And therefore be assur'd, my good Lord Marshal,</a>
<a id='line_2118'>    If we do now make our atonement well,</a>
<a id='line_2119'>    Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</a>
<a id='line_2120'>    Grow stronger for the breaking.</a>
<a id='line_2121'>  MOWBRAY. Be it so.</a>
<a id='line_2122'>    Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>                       Re-enter WESTMORELAND</a>

<a id='line_2126'>  WESTMORELAND. The Prince is here at hand. Pleaseth your lordship</a>
<a id='line_2127'>    To meet his Grace just distance 'tween our armies?</a>
<a id='line_2128'>  MOWBRAY. Your Grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.</a>

<a id='line_2136'>WESTMORELAND, OFFICERS, and others</a>
<a id='line_2137'></a>
<a id='line_2138'>  PRINCE JOHN. You are well encount'red here, my cousin Mowbray.</a>
<a id='line_2139'>    Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop;</a>
<a id='line_2140'>    And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.</a>
<a id='line_2141'>    My Lord of York, it better show'd with you</a>
<a id='line_2142'>    When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</a>
<a id='line_2143'>    Encircled you to hear with reverence</a>
<a id='line_2144'>    Your exposition on the holy text</a>
<a id='line_2145'>    Than now to see you here an iron man,</a>
<a id='line_2146'>    Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</a>
<a id='line_2147'>    Turning the word to sword, and life to death.</a>
<a id='line_2148'>    That man that sits within a monarch's heart</a>
<a id='line_2149'>    And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,</a>
<a id='line_2150'>    Would he abuse the countenance of the king,</a>
<a id='line_2151'>    Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach</a>
<a id='line_2152'>    In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,</a>
<a id='line_2153'>    It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</a>
<a id='line_2154'>    How deep you were within the books of God?</a>
<a id='line_2155'>    To us the speaker in His parliament,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>    To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself,</a>
<a id='line_2157'>    The very opener and intelligencer</a>
<a id='line_2158'>    Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_2159'>    And our dull workings. O, who shall believe</a>
<a id='line_2160'>    But you misuse the reverence of your place,</a>
<a id='line_2161'>    Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n</a>
<a id='line_2162'>    As a false favourite doth his prince's name,</a>
<a id='line_2163'>    In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,</a>
<a id='line_2164'>    Under the counterfeited zeal of God,</a>
<a id='line_2165'>    The subjects of His substitute, my father,</a>
<a id='line_2166'>    And both against the peace of heaven and him</a>
<a id='line_2167'>    Have here up-swarm'd them.</a>
<a id='line_2168'>  ARCHBISHOP. Good my Lord of Lancaster,</a>
<a id='line_2169'>    I am not here against your father's peace;</a>
<a id='line_2170'>    But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland,</a>
<a id='line_2171'>    The time misord'red doth, in common sense,</a>
<a id='line_2172'>    Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form</a>
<a id='line_2173'>    To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace</a>
<a id='line_2174'>    The parcels and particulars of our grief,</a>
<a id='line_2175'>    The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court,</a>
<a id='line_2176'>    Whereon this hydra son of war is born;</a>
<a id='line_2177'>    Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep</a>
<a id='line_2178'>    With grant of our most just and right desires;</a>
<a id='line_2179'>    And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,</a>
<a id='line_2180'>    Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.</a>
<a id='line_2181'>  MOWBRAY. If not, we ready are to try our fortunes</a>
<a id='line_2182'>    To the last man.</a>
<a id='line_2183'>  HASTINGS. And though we here fall down,</a>
<a id='line_2184'>    We have supplies to second our attempt.</a>
<a id='line_2185'>    If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;</a>
<a id='line_2186'>    And so success of mischief shall be born,</a>
<a id='line_2187'>    And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up</a>
<a id='line_2188'>    Whiles England shall have generation.</a>
<a id='line_2189'>  PRINCE JOHN. YOU are too shallow, Hastings, much to shallow,</a>
<a id='line_2190'>    To sound the bottom of the after-times.</a>
<a id='line_2191'>  WESTMORELAND. Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly</a>
<a id='line_2192'>    How far forth you do like their articles.</a>
<a id='line_2193'>  PRINCE JOHN. I like them all and do allow them well;</a>
<a id='line_2194'>    And swear here, by the honour of my blood,</a>
<a id='line_2195'>    My father's purposes have been mistook;</a>
<a id='line_2196'>    And some about him have too lavishly</a>
<a id='line_2197'>    Wrested his meaning and authority.</a>
<a id='line_2198'>    My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;</a>
<a id='line_2199'>    Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,</a>
<a id='line_2200'>    Discharge your powers unto their several counties,</a>
<a id='line_2201'>    As we will ours; and here, between the armies,</a>
<a id='line_2202'>    Let's drink together friendly and embrace,</a>

<a id='line_2205'>  ARCHBISHOP. I take your princely word for these redresses.</a>
<a id='line_2206'>  PRINCE JOHN. I give it you, and will maintain my word;</a>
<a id='line_2207'>    And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.</a>
<a id='line_2208'>  HASTINGS. Go, Captain, and deliver to the army</a>
<a id='line_2209'>    This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part.</a>
<a id='line_2210'>    I know it will please them. Hie thee, Captain.</a>

<a id='line_2283'>    what place, I pray?</a>
<a id='line_2284'>  COLVILLE. I am a knight sir; and my name is Colville of the Dale.</a>
<a id='line_2285'>  FALSTAFF. Well then, Colville is your name, a knight is your</a>
<a id='line_2286'>    degree, and your place the Dale. Colville shall still be your</a>

<a id='line_2289'>  COLVILLE. Are not you Sir John Falstaff?</a>
<a id='line_2290'>  FALSTAFF. As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do you yield,</a>
<a id='line_2291'>    sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops</a>
<a id='line_2292'>    of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death; therefore rouse up</a>
<a id='line_2293'>    fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy.</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  COLVILLE. I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought</a>
<a id='line_2295'>    yield me.</a>
<a id='line_2296'>  FALSTAFF. I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine;</a>
<a id='line_2297'>    and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name.</a>

<a id='line_2309'>    When everything is ended, then you come.</a>
<a id='line_2310'>    These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,</a>
<a id='line_2311'>    One time or other break some gallows' back.</a>
<a id='line_2312'>  FALSTAFF. I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I never</a>
<a id='line_2313'>    knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour. Do you</a>
<a id='line_2314'>    think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I, in my poor and</a>
<a id='line_2315'>    old motion, the expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with</a>
<a id='line_2316'>    the very extremest inch of possibility; I have found'red nine</a>
<a id='line_2317'>    score and odd posts; and here, travel tainted as I am, have, in</a>
<a id='line_2318'>    my pure and immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colville of the</a>
<a id='line_2319'>    Dale,a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of that?</a>
<a id='line_2320'>    He saw me, and yielded; that I may justly say with the hook-nos'd</a>
<a id='line_2321'>    fellow of Rome-I came, saw, and overcame.</a>
<a id='line_2322'>  PRINCE JOHN. It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.</a>

<a id='line_2324'>    beseech your Grace, let it be book'd with the rest of this day's</a>
<a id='line_2325'>    deeds; or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad</a>
<a id='line_2326'>    else, with mine own picture on the top on't, Colville kissing my</a>
<a id='line_2327'>    foot; to the which course if I be enforc'd, if you do not all</a>
<a id='line_2328'>    show like gilt twopences to me, and I, in the clear sky of fame,</a>
<a id='line_2329'>    o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the</a>
<a id='line_2330'>    element, which show like pins' heads to her, believe not the word</a>

<a id='line_2332'>  PRINCE JOHN. Thine's too heavy to mount.</a>
<a id='line_2333'>  FALSTAFF. Let it shine, then.</a>
<a id='line_2334'>  PRINCE JOHN. Thine's too thick to shine.</a>
<a id='line_2335'>  FALSTAFF. Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good,</a>
<a id='line_2336'>    and call it what you will.</a>
<a id='line_2337'>  PRINCE JOHN. Is thy name Colville?</a>
<a id='line_2338'>  COLVILLE. It is, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2339'>  PRINCE JOHN. A famous rebel art thou, Colville.</a>
<a id='line_2340'>  FALSTAFF. And a famous true subject took him.</a>
<a id='line_2341'>  COLVILLE. I am, my lord, but as my betters are</a>
<a id='line_2342'>    That led me hither. Had they been rul'd by me,</a>
<a id='line_2343'>    You should have won them dearer than you have.</a>
<a id='line_2344'>  FALSTAFF. I know not how they sold themselves; but thou, like a</a>

<a id='line_2352'>  PRINCE JOHN. Send Colville, with his confederates,</a>
<a id='line_2353'>    To York, to present execution.</a>
<a id='line_2354'>    Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.</a>

<a id='line_2356'>    And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.</a>

<a id='line_2363'>    pray, in your good report.</a>
<a id='line_2364'>  PRINCE JOHN. Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition,</a>
<a id='line_2365'>    Shall better speak of you than you deserve.</a>
<a id='line_2366'>                                         Exeunt all but FALSTAFF</a>
<a id='line_2367'>  FALSTAFF. I would you had but the wit; 'twere better than your</a>
<a id='line_2368'>    dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not</a>
<a id='line_2369'>    love me; nor a man cannot make him laugh- but that's no marvel;</a>
<a id='line_2370'>    he drinks no wine. There's never none of these demure boys come</a>
<a id='line_2371'>    to any proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and</a>
<a id='line_2372'>    making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    green-sickness; and then, when they marry, they get wenches. They</a>
<a id='line_2374'>    are generally fools and cowards-which some of us should be too,</a>
<a id='line_2375'>    but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold</a>
<a id='line_2376'>    operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; dries me there all</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it; makes it</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and</a>
<a id='line_2379'>    delectable shapes; which delivered o'er to the voice, the tongue,</a>
<a id='line_2380'>    which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood; which before,</a>
<a id='line_2382'>    cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the</a>
<a id='line_2383'>    badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it,</a>
<a id='line_2384'>    and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes. It</a>
<a id='line_2385'>    illumineth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the</a>
<a id='line_2386'>    rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital</a>
<a id='line_2387'>    commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their</a>
<a id='line_2388'>    captain, the heart, who, great and puff'd up with this retinue,</a>
<a id='line_2389'>    doth any deed of courage- and this valour comes of sherris. So</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets</a>
<a id='line_2391'>    it a-work; and learning, a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil</a>
<a id='line_2392'>    till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes</a>
<a id='line_2393'>    it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did</a>
<a id='line_2394'>    naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and</a>
<a id='line_2395'>    bare land, manured, husbanded, and till'd, with excellent</a>
<a id='line_2396'>    endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris,</a>
<a id='line_2397'>    that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons,</a>
<a id='line_2398'>    the first humane principle I would teach them should be to</a>
<a id='line_2399'>    forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</a>

<a id='line_2768'>    Better opinion, better confirmation;</a>
<a id='line_2769'>    For all the soil of the achievement goes</a>

<a id='line_2783'>    Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</a>
<a id='line_2784'>    And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</a>

<a id='line_2786'>    By whose fell working I was first advanc'd,</a>
<a id='line_2787'>    And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</a>
<a id='line_2788'>    To be again displac'd; which to avoid,</a>
<a id='line_2789'>    I cut them off; and had a purpose now</a>
<a id='line_2790'>    To lead out many to the Holy Land,</a>
<a id='line_2791'>    Lest rest and lying still might make them look</a>

<a id='line_2796'>    More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</a>

<a id='line_2884'>    and PAGE]  If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four</a>

<a id='line_2886'>    wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's</a>
<a id='line_2887'>    spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear themselves</a>
<a id='line_2888'>    like foolish justices: he, by conversing with them, is turned</a>
<a id='line_2889'>    into a justice-like serving-man. Their spirits are so married in</a>
<a id='line_2890'>    conjunction with the participation of society that they flock</a>
<a id='line_2891'>    together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to</a>

<a id='line_2893'>    being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master</a>

<a id='line_3325'>    So will I those that kept me company.</a>
<a id='line_3326'>    When thou dost hear I am as I have been,</a>
<a id='line_3327'>    Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,</a>
<a id='line_3328'>    The tutor and the feeder of my riots.</a>
<a id='line_3329'>    Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,</a>
<a id='line_3330'>    As I have done the rest of my misleaders,</a>
<a id='line_3331'>    Not to come near our person by ten mile.</a>
<a id='line_3332'>    For competence of life I will allow you,</a>
<a id='line_3333'>    That lack of means enforce you not to evils;</a>
<a id='line_3334'>    And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,</a>
<a id='line_3335'>    We will, according to your strengths and qualities,</a>
<a id='line_3336'>    Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_3337'>    To see perform'd the tenour of our word.</a>
<a id='line_3338'>    Set on.                        Exeunt the KING and his train</a>
<a id='line_3339'>  FALSTAFF. Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pounds.</a>
<a id='line_3340'>  SHALLOW. Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me have</a>
<a id='line_3341'>    home with me.</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  FALSTAFF. That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at</a>
<a id='line_3343'>    this; I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must</a>
<a id='line_3344'>    seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements; I will be the</a>
<a id='line_3345'>    man yet that shall make you great.</a>
<a id='line_3346'>  SHALLOW. I cannot perceive how, unless you give me your doublet,</a>
<a id='line_3347'>    and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John, let me</a>
<a id='line_3348'>    have five hundred of my thousand.</a>
<a id='line_3349'>  FALSTAFF. Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard</a>
<a id='line_3350'>    was but a colour.</a>
<a id='line_3351'>  SHALLOW. A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.</a>
<a id='line_3352'>  FALSTAFF. Fear no colours; go with me to dinner. Come, Lieutenant</a>
<a id='line_3353'>    Pistol; come, Bardolph. I shall be sent for soon at night.</a>
<a id='line_3354'></a>
<a id='line_3355'>            Re-enter PRINCE JOHN, the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE,</a>
<a id='line_3356'>                            with officers</a>
<a id='line_3357'></a>
<a id='line_3358'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;</a>
<a id='line_3359'>    Take all his company along with him.</a>
<a id='line_3360'>  FALSTAFF. My lord, my lord-</a>
<a id='line_3361'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.</a>
<a id='line_3362'>    Take them away.</a>
<a id='line_3363'>  PISTOL. Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta.</a>
<a id='line_3364'>           Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE</a>
<a id='line_3365'>  PRINCE JOHN. I like this fair proceeding of the King's.</a>
<a id='line_3366'>    He hath intent his wonted followers</a>
<a id='line_3367'>    Shall all be very well provided for;</a>
<a id='line_3368'>    But all are banish'd till their conversations</a>
<a id='line_3369'>    Appear more wise and modest to the world.</a>
<a id='line_3370'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. And so they are.</a>
<a id='line_3371'>  PRINCE JOHN. The King hath call'd his parliament, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_3372'>  CHIEF JUSTICE. He hath.</a>
<a id='line_3373'>  PRINCE JOHN. I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,</a>
<a id='line_3374'>    We bear our civil swords and native fire</a>
<a id='line_3375'>    As far as France. I heard a bird so sing,</a>
<a id='line_3376'>    Whose music, to my thinking, pleas'd the King.</a>
<a id='line_3377'>    Come, will you hence?                                 Exeunt</a>
<a id='line_3378'></a>
<a id='line_3379'>EPILOGUE EPILOGUE.</a>
<a id='line_3380'></a>
<a id='line_3381'>  First my fear, then my curtsy, last my speech. My fear, is your</a>
<a id='line_3382'>  displeasure; my curtsy, my duty; and my speech, to beg your pardons.</a>
<a id='line_3383'>  If you look for a good speech now, you undo me; for what I have to</a>
<a id='line_3384'>  say is of mine own making; and what, indeed, I should say will, I</a>
<a id='line_3385'>  doubt, prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the</a>
<a id='line_3386'>  venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in</a>
<a id='line_3387'>  the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to</a>
<a id='line_3388'>  promise you a better. I meant, indeed, to pay you with this; which if</a>
<a id='line_3389'>  like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my</a>
<a id='line_3390'>  gentle creditors, lose. Here I promis'd you I would be, and here I</a>
<a id='line_3391'>  commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you</a>
<a id='line_3392'>  some, and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely; and so I kneel</a>
<a id='line_3393'>  down before you- but, indeed, to pray for the Queen. If my tongue</a>
<a id='line_3394'>  cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs?</a>
<a id='line_3395'>  And yet that were but light payment-to dance out of your debt. But a</a>
<a id='line_3396'>  good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I.</a>
<a id='line_3397'>  All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me. If the gentlemen will not,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>  then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never</a>
<a id='line_3399'>  seen before in such an assembly. One word more, I beseech you. If you</a>
<a id='line_3400'>  be not too much cloy'd with fat meat, our humble author will continue</a>
<a id='line_3401'>  the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair</a>
<a id='line_3402'>  Katherine of France; where, for anything I know, Falstaff shall die</a>
<a id='line_3403'>  of a sweat, unless already 'a be killed with your hard opinions; for</a>
<a id='line_3404'>  Oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the man. My tongue is weary;</a>
<a id='line_3405'>  when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.</a>
