<a id='line_62'>ACT I.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>SCENE I. An Apartment in the Duke’s Palace.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'> Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians</a>
<a id='line_67'> attending.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_70'>If music be the food of love, play on,</a>
<a id='line_71'>Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,</a>
<a id='line_72'>The appetite may sicken and so die.</a>
<a id='line_73'>That strain again, it had a dying fall;</a>
<a id='line_74'>O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound</a>
<a id='line_75'>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</a>
<a id='line_76'>Stealing and giving odour. Enough; no more;</a>
<a id='line_77'>’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.</a>
<a id='line_78'>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,</a>
<a id='line_79'>That notwithstanding thy capacity</a>
<a id='line_80'>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</a>
<a id='line_81'>Of what validity and pitch soever,</a>
<a id='line_82'>But falls into abatement and low price</a>
<a id='line_83'>Even in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy,</a>
<a id='line_84'>That it alone is high fantastical.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>CURIO.</a>
<a id='line_87'>Will you go hunt, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>

<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_96'>Why so I do, the noblest that I have.</a>
<a id='line_97'>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</a>
<a id='line_98'>Methought she purg’d the air of pestilence;</a>
<a id='line_99'>That instant was I turn’d into a hart,</a>
<a id='line_100'>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,</a>
<a id='line_101'>E’er since pursue me. How now? what news from her?</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'> Enter Valentine.</a>

<a id='line_105'>VALENTINE.</a>
<a id='line_106'>So please my lord, I might not be admitted,</a>
<a id='line_107'>But from her handmaid do return this answer:</a>
<a id='line_108'>The element itself, till seven years’ heat,</a>
<a id='line_109'>Shall not behold her face at ample view;</a>
<a id='line_110'>But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,</a>
<a id='line_111'>And water once a day her chamber round</a>
<a id='line_112'>With eye-offending brine: all this to season</a>
<a id='line_113'>A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh</a>
<a id='line_114'>And lasting in her sad remembrance.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_117'>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</a>
<a id='line_118'>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</a>
<a id='line_119'>How will she love, when the rich golden shaft</a>
<a id='line_120'>Hath kill’d the flock of all affections else</a>
<a id='line_121'>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</a>
<a id='line_122'>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill’d</a>
<a id='line_123'>Her sweet perfections with one self king!</a>
<a id='line_124'>Away before me to sweet beds of flowers,</a>

<a id='line_129'>SCENE II. The sea-coast.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'> Enter Viola, a Captain and Sailors.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_134'>What country, friends, is this?</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_137'>This is Illyria, lady.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_140'>And what should I do in Illyria?</a>
<a id='line_141'>My brother he is in Elysium.</a>
<a id='line_142'>Perchance he is not drown’d. What think you, sailors?</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_145'>It is perchance that you yourself were sav’d.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_148'>O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_151'>True, madam; and to comfort you with chance,</a>
<a id='line_152'>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</a>
<a id='line_153'>When you, and those poor number sav’d with you,</a>
<a id='line_154'>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</a>
<a id='line_155'>Most provident in peril, bind himself,</a>
<a id='line_156'>(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)</a>
<a id='line_157'>To a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea;</a>
<a id='line_158'>Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,</a>
<a id='line_159'>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</a>
<a id='line_160'>So long as I could see.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_163'>For saying so, there’s gold!</a>
<a id='line_164'>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</a>
<a id='line_165'>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</a>
<a id='line_166'>The like of him. Know’st thou this country?</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_169'>Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born</a>
<a id='line_170'>Not three hours’ travel from this very place.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_173'>Who governs here?</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_176'>A noble duke, in nature as in name.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_179'>What is his name?</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_182'>Orsino.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_185'>Orsino! I have heard my father name him.</a>
<a id='line_186'>He was a bachelor then.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_189'>And so is now, or was so very late;</a>
<a id='line_190'>For but a month ago I went from hence,</a>
<a id='line_191'>And then ’twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know,</a>
<a id='line_192'>What great ones do, the less will prattle of)</a>
<a id='line_193'>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_196'>What’s she?</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_199'>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</a>
<a id='line_200'>That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her</a>
<a id='line_201'>In the protection of his son, her brother,</a>
<a id='line_202'>Who shortly also died; for whose dear love</a>
<a id='line_203'>They say, she hath abjur’d the company</a>
<a id='line_204'>And sight of men.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_207'>O that I served that lady,</a>
<a id='line_208'>And might not be delivered to the world,</a>
<a id='line_209'>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</a>
<a id='line_210'>What my estate is.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_213'>That were hard to compass,</a>
<a id='line_214'>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</a>
<a id='line_215'>No, not the Duke’s.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_218'>There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;</a>
<a id='line_219'>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</a>
<a id='line_220'>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</a>
<a id='line_221'>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</a>
<a id='line_222'>With this thy fair and outward character.</a>
<a id='line_223'>I pray thee, and I’ll pay thee bounteously,</a>
<a id='line_224'>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</a>
<a id='line_225'>For such disguise as haply shall become</a>
<a id='line_226'>The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke;</a>
<a id='line_227'>Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.</a>
<a id='line_228'>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing,</a>
<a id='line_229'>And speak to him in many sorts of music,</a>
<a id='line_230'>That will allow me very worth his service.</a>
<a id='line_231'>What else may hap, to time I will commit;</a>
<a id='line_232'>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>CAPTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_235'>Be you his eunuch and your mute I’ll be;</a>
<a id='line_236'>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_239'>I thank thee. Lead me on.</a>

<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>SCENE III. A Room in Olivia’s House.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'> Enter Sir Toby and Maria.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_248'>What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I</a>
<a id='line_249'>am sure care’s an enemy to life.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_252'>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights; your cousin,</a>
<a id='line_253'>my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_256'>Why, let her except, before excepted.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_259'>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_262'>Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good</a>
<a id='line_263'>enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let</a>
<a id='line_264'>them hang themselves in their own straps.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_267'>That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it</a>
<a id='line_268'>yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here</a>
<a id='line_269'>to be her wooer.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_272'>Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_275'>Ay, he.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_278'>He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_281'>What’s that to th’ purpose?</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_284'>Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.</a>
<a id='line_285'></a>
<a id='line_286'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_287'>Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool,</a>
<a id='line_288'>and a prodigal.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_291'>Fie, that you’ll say so! he plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks</a>
<a id='line_292'>three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the</a>
<a id='line_293'>good gifts of nature.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_296'>He hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a</a>
<a id='line_297'>great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay</a>
<a id='line_298'>the gust he hath in quarrelling, ’tis thought among the prudent he</a>
<a id='line_299'>would quickly have the gift of a grave.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_302'>By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.</a>
<a id='line_303'>Who are they?</a>
<a id='line_304'></a>
<a id='line_305'>MARIA.</a>
<a id='line_306'>They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_309'>With drinking healths to my niece; I’ll drink to her as long as there</a>
<a id='line_310'>is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a</a>
<a id='line_311'>coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the</a>
<a id='line_312'>toe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes</a>
<a id='line_313'>Sir Andrew Agueface.</a>

<a id='line_346'></a>

<a id='line_351'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_352'>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the</a>

<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>SIR ANDREW.</a>

<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_370'>Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.</a>

<a id='line_399'>O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put</a>
<a id='line_400'>down?</a>
<a id='line_401'></a>
<a id='line_402'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_403'>Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.</a>
<a id='line_404'>Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary</a>
<a id='line_405'>man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm</a>
<a id='line_406'>to my wit.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_409'>No question.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_412'>And I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.</a>

<a id='line_414'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_415'>_Pourquoy_, my dear knight?</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_418'>What is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in</a>
<a id='line_419'>the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I</a>
<a id='line_420'>but followed the arts!</a>
<a id='line_421'></a>
<a id='line_422'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_423'>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.</a>
<a id='line_424'></a>
<a id='line_425'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_426'>Why, would that have mended my hair?</a>
<a id='line_427'></a>
<a id='line_428'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_429'>Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_432'>But it becomes me well enough, does’t not?</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_435'>Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a</a>
<a id='line_436'>houswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_439'>Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if</a>
<a id='line_440'>she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard</a>

<a id='line_442'></a>
<a id='line_443'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_444'>She’ll none o’ the Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in</a>
<a id='line_445'>estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life</a>
<a id='line_446'>in’t, man.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_449'>I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ the strangest mind i’ the</a>

<a id='line_460'>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_463'>Faith, I can cut a caper.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>

<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_469'>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in</a>
<a id='line_470'>Illyria.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_473'>Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain</a>
<a id='line_474'>before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture?</a>
<a id='line_475'>Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a</a>
<a id='line_476'>coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make</a>
<a id='line_477'>water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide</a>
<a id='line_478'>virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it</a>
<a id='line_479'>was formed under the star of a galliard.</a>
<a id='line_480'></a>
<a id='line_481'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_482'>Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam’d-colour’d</a>

<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>SIR TOBY.</a>

<a id='line_488'>SIR ANDREW.</a>
<a id='line_489'>Taurus? That’s sides and heart.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>SIR TOBY.</a>
<a id='line_492'>No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha,</a>

<a id='line_2369'>Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.</a>
<a id='line_2370'>Under your hard construction must I sit;</a>
<a id='line_2371'>To force that on you in a shameful cunning,</a>

<a id='line_2375'>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</a>

<a id='line_2428'>A murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon</a>

<a id='line_2430'>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</a>
<a id='line_2431'>By maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,</a>
<a id='line_2432'>I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,</a>

<a id='line_2434'>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</a>
<a id='line_2435'>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;</a>

<a id='line_2439'>VIOLA.</a>
<a id='line_2440'>By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</a>

<a id='line_2486'>And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.</a>
<a id='line_2487'></a>
<a id='line_2488'>FABIAN.</a>
<a id='line_2489'>She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you,</a>
<a id='line_2490'>to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone</a>
<a id='line_2491'>in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some</a>
<a id='line_2492'>excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the</a>
<a id='line_2493'>youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was</a>
<a id='line_2494'>balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and</a>
<a id='line_2495'>you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will</a>
