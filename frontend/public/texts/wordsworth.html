<a id='line_116'>The poems written in 1804 were not numerous; and, with the exception of</a>
<a id='line_117'>'The Small Celandine', the stanzas beginning "I wandered lonely as a</a>
<a id='line_118'>cloud," and "She was a Phantom of delight," they were less remarkable</a>
<a id='line_119'>than those of the two preceding, and the three following years.</a>
<a id='line_120'>Wordsworth's poetical activity in 1804 is not recorded, however, in</a>
<a id='line_121'>Lyrical Ballads or Sonnets, but in 'The Prelude', much of which was</a>
<a id='line_122'>thought out, and afterwards dictated to Dorothy or Mary Wordsworth, on</a>
<a id='line_123'>the terrace walk of Lancrigg during that year; while the 'Ode,</a>
<a id='line_124'>Intimations of Immortality' was altered and added to, although it did</a>
<a id='line_125'>not receive its final form till 1806. In the sixth book of 'The</a>
<a id='line_126'>Prelude', p. 222, the lines occur:</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>  'Four years and thirty, told this very week,</a>
<a id='line_129'>  Have I been now a sojourner on earth.'</a>

<a id='line_132'>have been composed in April, 1804.--Ed.</a>

<a id='line_237'>FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>[Footnote A: Compare two references to Mary Wordsworth in 'The Prelude':</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>    'Another maid there was, who also shed</a>
<a id='line_242'>  A gladness o'er that season, then to me,</a>
<a id='line_243'>  By her exulting outside look of youth</a>
<a id='line_244'>  And placid under-countenance, first endeared;'</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>(Book vi. l. 224).</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>  'She came, no more a phantom to adorn</a>
<a id='line_249'>  A moment, but an inmate of the heart,</a>
<a id='line_250'>  And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined</a>
<a id='line_251'>  To penetrate the lofty and the low;'</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>(Book xiv, l. 268).--Ed.]</a>
<a id='line_254'></a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>It is not easy to say what were the "four lines composed as a part of</a>
<a id='line_258'>the verses on the 'Highland Girl'" which the Fenwick note tells us was</a>
<a id='line_259'>"the germ of this poem." They may be lines now incorporated in those 'To</a>
<a id='line_260'>a Highland Girl', vol. ii. p. 389, or they may be lines in the present</a>
<a id='line_261'>poem, which Wordsworth wrote at first for the 'Highland Girl', but</a>
<a id='line_262'>afterwards transferred to this one. They _may_ have been the first four</a>
<a id='line_263'>lines of the later poem. The two should be read consecutively, and</a>
<a id='line_264'>compared.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>After Wordsworth's death, a writer in the 'Daily News', January</a>
<a id='line_267'>1859--then understood to be Miss Harriet Martineau--wrote thus:</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>  "In the 'Memoirs', by the nephew of the poet, it is said that these</a>
<a id='line_270'>  verses refer to Mrs. Wordsworth; but for half of Wordsworth's life it</a>
<a id='line_271'>  was always understood that they referred to some other phantom which</a>
<a id='line_272'>  'gleamed upon his sight' before Mary Hutchinson."</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>This statement is much more than improbable; it is, I think, disproved</a>
<a id='line_275'>by the Fenwick note. They cannot refer to the "Lucy" of the Goslar</a>
<a id='line_276'>poems; and Wordsworth indicates, as plainly as he chose, to whom they</a>
<a id='line_277'>actually do refer. Compare the Hon. Justice Coleridge's account of a</a>
<a id='line_278'>conversation with Wordsworth ('Memoirs', vol. ii. p. 306), in which the</a>
<a id='line_279'>poet expressly said that the lines were written on his wife. The</a>
<a id='line_280'>question was, however, set at rest in a conversation of Wordsworth with</a>
<a id='line_281'>Henry Crabb Robinson, who wrote in his 'Diary' on</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>  "May 12 (1842).--Wordsworth said that the poems 'Our walk was far</a>
<a id='line_284'>  among the ancient trees' [vol. ii. p. 167], then 'She was a Phantom of</a>
<a id='line_285'>  delight,' [B] and finally the two sonnets 'To a Painter', should be</a>
<a id='line_286'>  read in succession as exhibiting the different phases of his affection</a>
<a id='line_287'>  to his wife."</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>('Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson',</a>
<a id='line_290'>vol. iii. p. 197.)</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>The use of the word "machine," in the third stanza of the poem, has been</a>
<a id='line_293'>much criticised, but for a similar use of the term, see the sequel to</a>
<a id='line_294'>'The Waggoner' (p. 107):</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>  'Forgive me, then; for I had been</a>
<a id='line_297'>  On friendly terms with this Machine.'</a>

<a id='line_302'>  'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him.'</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>The progress of mechanical industry in Britain since the beginning of</a>
<a id='line_305'>the present century has given a more limited, and purely technical,</a>

<a id='line_411'>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, under date,</a>
<a id='line_412'>Thursday, April 15, 1802:</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>  "When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few</a>
<a id='line_415'>  daffodils close to the water side. We fancied that the sea had floated</a>
<a id='line_416'>  the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as</a>
<a id='line_417'>  we went along there were more, and yet more; and, at last, under the</a>
<a id='line_418'>  boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along</a>
<a id='line_419'>  the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpike road. I never saw</a>
<a id='line_420'>  daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones, about and</a>
<a id='line_421'>  above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow</a>
<a id='line_422'>  for weariness; and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed</a>
<a id='line_423'>  as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the</a>
<a id='line_424'>  lake. They looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing. This wind blew</a>
<a id='line_425'>  directly over the lake to them. There was here and there a little</a>
<a id='line_426'>  knot, and a few stragglers higher up; but they were so few as not to</a>
<a id='line_427'>  disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway. We</a>
<a id='line_428'>  rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the waves</a>
<a id='line_429'>  at different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the</a>
<a id='line_430'>  sea...."</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>In the edition of 1815 there is a footnote to the lines</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>  'They flash upon that inward eye</a>
<a id='line_435'>  Which is the bliss of solitude'</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>to the following effect:</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>  "The subject of these Stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and</a>
<a id='line_440'>  simple impression (approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum)</a>
<a id='line_441'>  upon the imaginative faculty, than an exertion of it. The one which</a>
<a id='line_442'>  follows [A] is strictly a Reverie; and neither that, nor the next</a>
<a id='line_443'>  after it in succession, 'Power of Music', would have been placed here</a>
<a id='line_444'>  except for the reason given in the foregoing note."</a>
<a id='line_445'></a>
<a id='line_446'>The being "placed here" refers to its being included among the "Poems of</a>
<a id='line_447'>the Imagination." The "foregoing note" is the note appended to 'The Horn</a>
<a id='line_448'>of Egremont Castle'; and the "reason given" in it is "to avoid a</a>
<a id='line_449'>needless multiplication of the Classes" into which Wordsworth divided</a>
<a id='line_450'>his poems. This note of 181? [B], is reprinted mainly to show the</a>
<a id='line_451'>difficulties to which Wordsworth was reduced by the artificial method of</a>
<a id='line_452'>arrangement referred to. The following letter to Mr. Wrangham is a more</a>
<a id='line_453'>appropriate illustration of the poem of "The Daffodils." It was written,</a>
<a id='line_454'>the late Bishop of Lincoln says, "sometime afterwards." (See 'Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_455'>Wordsworth', vol. i. pp. 183, 184); and, for the whole of the letter,</a>
<a id='line_456'>see a subsequent volume of this edition.</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>  "GRASMERE, Nov. 4.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>  "MY DEAR WRANGHAM,--I am indeed much pleased that Mrs. Wrangham and</a>
<a id='line_461'>  yourself have been gratified by these breathings of simple nature. You</a>
<a id='line_462'>  mention Butler, Montagu's friend; not Tom Butler, but the conveyancer:</a>
<a id='line_463'>  when I was in town in spring, he happened to see the volumes lying on</a>
<a id='line_464'>  Montagu's mantelpiece, and to glance his eye upon the very poem of</a>
<a id='line_465'>  'The Daffodils.' 'Aye,' says he, 'a fine morsel this for the</a>
<a id='line_466'>  Reviewers.' When this was told me (for I was not present) I observed</a>
<a id='line_467'>  that there were 'two lines' in that little poem which, if thoroughly</a>
<a id='line_468'>  felt, would annihilate nine-tenths of the reviews of the kingdom, as</a>
<a id='line_469'>  they would find no readers. The lines I alluded to were these:</a>
<a id='line_470'></a>
<a id='line_471'>    'They flash upon that inward eye</a>
<a id='line_472'>    Which is the bliss of solitude.'"</a>
<a id='line_473'></a>
<a id='line_474'>These two lines were composed by Mrs. Wordsworth. In 1877 the daffodils</a>
<a id='line_475'>were still growing in abundance on the shore of Ullswater, below</a>
<a id='line_476'>Gowbarrow Park.</a>

<a id='line_670'>excluded as superfluous there, but preserved in the faint hope that it</a>
<a id='line_671'>may turn to account by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel. My</a>
<a id='line_672'>poetry has been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort,--a</a>
<a id='line_673'>charge which the piece beginning, "Lyre! though such power do in thy</a>

<a id='line_678'>tone and unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all</a>

<a id='line_1771'>  His father's house, where to the innocent child</a>

<a id='line_3332'>The Principal had not remembered at the time that the "perfection of</a>

<a id='line_3334'>the prosaic version of 1820 and 1827 ever took its place. Wordsworth's</a>
<a id='line_3335'>return to his original reading was one of the wisest changes he</a>

<a id='line_3340'>There is a Peele Castle, on a small rocky island, close to the town of</a>
<a id='line_3341'>Peele, in the Isle of Man; yet separated from it, much as St. Michael's</a>
<a id='line_3342'>Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland. This castle was</a>
<a id='line_3343'>believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted, and which gave</a>
<a id='line_3344'>rise to the foregoing lines. I visited it in 1879, being then ignorant</a>
<a id='line_3345'>that any other Peele Castle existed; and although, the day being calm,</a>
<a id='line_3346'>and the season summer, I thought Sir George had idealized his subject</a>
<a id='line_3347'>much--(as I had just left Coleorton, where the picture still exists)--I</a>
<a id='line_3348'>accepted the customary opinion. But I am now convinced, both from the</a>
<a id='line_3349'>testimony of the Arnold family, [B] and as the result of a visit to Piel</a>
<a id='line_3350'>Castle, near Barrow in Furness, that Wordsworth refers to it. The late</a>
<a id='line_3351'>Bishop of Lincoln, in his uncle's 'Memoirs' (vol. i. p. 299), quotes the</a>
<a id='line_3352'>line</a>

<a id='line_3354'>  "I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile,"</a>

<a id='line_3358'>  "He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the</a>
<a id='line_3359'>  house of his cousin, Mr. Barker."</a>
<a id='line_3360'></a>
<a id='line_3361'>This house was at Rampside, the village opposite Piel, on the coast of</a>
<a id='line_3362'>Lancashire. The "rugged pile," too, now "cased in the unfeeling armour</a>
<a id='line_3363'>of old time," painted by Beaumont, is obviously this Piel Castle near</a>
<a id='line_3364'>Barrow. I took the engraving of his picture with me, when visiting it:</a>
<a id='line_3365'>and although Sir George--after the manner of landscape artists of his</a>
<a id='line_3366'>day--took many liberties with his subjects, it is apparent that it was</a>
<a id='line_3367'>this, and not Peele Castle in Mona, that he painted. The "four summer</a>
<a id='line_3368'>weeks" referred to in the first stanza, were those spent at Piel during</a>

<a id='line_3585'>  track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale, and is</a>
<a id='line_3586'>  about 100 yards from the tarn. No more suitable one can be found, and</a>
<a id='line_3587'>  we have the testimony of Mr. David Richardson of Newcastle, who has</a>
<a id='line_3588'>  practical knowledge of engineering, that it is the fittest, both from</a>
<a id='line_3589'>  shape and from slight incline of plane.</a>
<a id='line_3590'></a>
<a id='line_3591'>  It has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock, that so</a>
<a id='line_3592'>  the inscription may be slightly protected, and to engrave the letters</a>
<a id='line_3593'>  upon the face of the panel thus obtained. But it is not quite certain</a>
<a id='line_3594'>  yet that the grain of the rock--volcanic ash--will admit of the</a>
<a id='line_3595'>  lettering. If this cannot be carried out, it has been determined to</a>
<a id='line_3596'>  have the letters engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate, and imbed it</a>
<a id='line_3597'>  in the Grisedale Rock.</a>
<a id='line_3598'></a>
<a id='line_3599'>  It is believed that the simplicity of the design, the lonely isolation</a>
<a id='line_3600'>  of this mountain memorial, will appeal at once</a>
<a id='line_3601'></a>
<a id='line_3602'>    ' ... to the few who pass this way,</a>
<a id='line_3603'>    Traveller or Shepherd.'</a>
<a id='line_3604'></a>
<a id='line_3605'>  And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see</a>
<a id='line_3606'>  it, to forego the wish of adding to it, or taking anything from it, by</a>
<a id='line_3607'>  engraving their own names; and to let the Monumental Stone stand, as</a>
<a id='line_3608'>  the poet wished it might</a>
<a id='line_3609'></a>
<a id='line_3610'>    ' ... stand, SACRED as a Shrine.'</a>
<a id='line_3611'></a>
<a id='line_3612'>  We owe great thanks to Mrs. Sturge for first surveying the place, to</a>
<a id='line_3613'>  ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_3614'>  striking in position; to Mr. Richardson, jun., for his etching of the</a>
<a id='line_3615'>  rock, upon which the inscription is to be made; to his father for the</a>
<a id='line_3616'>  kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock; and</a>
<a id='line_3617'>  particularly to the seconder of the original proposal, and my</a>
<a id='line_3618'>  coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work,</a>
<a id='line_3619'>  Mr. W. H. Hills.</a>
<a id='line_3620'></a>
<a id='line_3621'>  H. D. RAWNSLEY.</a>
<a id='line_3622'></a>
<a id='line_3623'>  _P. S._--When we came to examine the rock, we found the area for the</a>
<a id='line_3624'>  panel less than we had hoped for, owing to certain rock fissures,</a>
<a id='line_3625'>  which, by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface, would</a>
<a id='line_3626'>  have much interfered with the durability of the inscription. The</a>
<a id='line_3627'>  available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9</a>
<a id='line_3628'>  inches in depth. Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone, it</a>
<a id='line_3629'>  may be quite possible to letter the native rock; but it has been</a>
<a id='line_3630'>  difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that</a>
<a id='line_3631'>  shall be at once in good taste, forcible, and plain. It was proposed</a>
<a id='line_3632'>  that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the</a>
<a id='line_3633'>  inscription cut on the rock, in the late Mr. Ball's garden grounds</a>
<a id='line_3634'>  below the Mount at Rydal, should be adopted; but a final decision has</a>
<a id='line_3635'>  been given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has</a>
<a id='line_3636'>  designed. The panel is, from its position, certain to attract the eye</a>
<a id='line_3637'>  of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass.</a>

<a id='line_3647'></a>
<a id='line_3648'>  "One morning, coming down early, I saw what I thought was a great big</a>

<a id='line_3650'>  which had sunk with all sails set, hardly three miles from the shore,</a>

<a id='line_3652'></a>
<a id='line_3653'>  Had any of the crew taken refuge in the main-top, they might have been</a>
<a id='line_3654'>  saved; but the bowsprit, which was crowded with human beings, gave a</a>
<a id='line_3655'>  lurch into the sea as the ship settled down, and thus all were washed</a>
<a id='line_3656'>  off--though the timber appeared again above water when the</a>
<a id='line_3657'>  'Abergavenny' touched the ground. The ship had sprung a leak off St.</a>
<a id='line_3658'>  Alban's Head; and in spite of pumps, she went to the bottom just</a>
<a id='line_3659'>  within reach of safety."    Pp. 12, 13.</a>

<a id='line_3676'>  "... It does me good to weep for him, and it does me good to find that</a>
<a id='line_3677'>  others weep, and I bless them for it. ... It is with me, when I write,</a>
<a id='line_3678'>  as when I am walking out in this vale, once so full of joy. I can turn</a>
<a id='line_3679'>  to no object that does not remind me of our loss. I see nothing that</a>
<a id='line_3680'>  he would not have loved, and enjoyed.... My consolations rather come</a>
<a id='line_3681'>  to me in gusts of feeling, than are the quiet growth of my mind. I</a>
<a id='line_3682'>  know it will not always be so. The time will come when the light of</a>
<a id='line_3683'>  the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure</a>
<a id='line_3684'>  joy; not the same _gladness_, that can never be--but yet a joy even</a>
<a id='line_3685'>  more tender. It will soothe me to know how happy he would have been,</a>
<a id='line_3686'>  could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle.... He was taken away</a>
<a id='line_3687'>  in the freshness of his manhood; pure he was, and innocent as a child.</a>
<a id='line_3688'>  Never human being was more thoroughly modest, and his courage I need</a>
<a id='line_3689'>  not speak of. He was 'seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the</a>
<a id='line_3690'>  first mate a few minutes before the ship went down;' and when nothing</a>
<a id='line_3691'>  more could be done, He said, 'the will of God be done.' I have no</a>
<a id='line_3692'>  doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he</a>
<a id='line_3693'>  was as calm as before, if some thought of what we should endure did</a>
<a id='line_3694'>  not awaken a pang.... He loved solitude, and he rejoiced in society.</a>
<a id='line_3695'>  He would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishing-rod, or led</a>
<a id='line_3696'>  on by the mere pleasure of walking, for many hours; or he would walk</a>
<a id='line_3697'>  with W. or me, or both of us, and was continually pointing out--with a</a>
<a id='line_3698'>  gladness which is seldom seen but in very young people--something</a>
<a id='line_3699'>  which perhaps would have escaped our observation; for he had so fine</a>
<a id='line_3700'>  an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him, and so tender a</a>
<a id='line_3701'>  feeling that he never noticed anything in vain. Many a time has he</a>
<a id='line_3702'>  called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars, or a cloudy</a>
<a id='line_3703'>  sky, or this vale in the quiet moonlight; but the stars and moon were</a>
<a id='line_3704'>  his chief delight. He made of them his companions when he was at sea,</a>
<a id='line_3705'>  and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night</a>
<a id='line_3706'>  fed in him. Then he was so happy by the fireside. Any little business</a>
<a id='line_3707'>  of the house interested him. He loved our cottage. He helped us to</a>
<a id='line_3708'>  furnish it, and to make the garden. Trees are growing now which he</a>
<a id='line_3709'>  planted.... He staid with us till the 29th of September, having come</a>
<a id='line_3710'>  to us about the end of January. During that time Mary Hutchinson--now</a>
<a id='line_3711'>  Mary Wordsworth--staid with us six weeks. John used to walk with her</a>
<a id='line_3712'>  everywhere, and they were exceedingly attached to each other; so my</a>
<a id='line_3713'>  poor sister mourns with us, not merely because we have lost one who</a>
<a id='line_3714'>  was so dear to William and me, but from tender love to John and an</a>
<a id='line_3715'>  intimate knowledge of him. Her hopes as well as ours were fixed on</a>
<a id='line_3716'>  John.... I can think of nothing but of our departed Brother, yet I am</a>
<a id='line_3717'>  very tranquil to-day. I honour him, and love him, and glory in his</a>
<a id='line_3718'>  memory...."</a>

<a id='line_3720'>Southey, writing to his friend, C. W. W. Wynn, on the 3rd of April 1805,</a>
<a id='line_3721'>says:</a>
<a id='line_3722'></a>
<a id='line_3723'>  "DEAR WYNN,</a>
<a id='line_3724'></a>
<a id='line_3725'>  I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the</a>
<a id='line_3726'>  'Abergavenny', of which Wordsworth's brother was captain. Of course</a>
<a id='line_3727'>  the news came flying up to us from all quarters, and it has disordered</a>
<a id='line_3728'>  me from head to foot. At such circumstances I believe we feel as much</a>
<a id='line_3729'>  for others as for ourselves; just as a violent blow occasions the same</a>
<a id='line_3730'>  pain as a wound, and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the</a>
<a id='line_3731'>  moment as the man whose leg is shot off. In fact, I am writing to you</a>
<a id='line_3732'>  merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to</a>
<a id='line_3733'>  do anything else. It is the heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever</a>
<a id='line_3734'>  experienced, and in all probability I shall have to communicate it to</a>
<a id='line_3735'>  him, as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him.</a>
<a id='line_3736'>  What renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is,</a>
<a id='line_3737'>  that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event</a>
<a id='line_3738'>  occurs, by the mere mention of shipwreck, or the sound of the wind. Of</a>
<a id='line_3739'>  all deaths it is the most dreadful, from the circumstances of terror</a>

<a id='line_3747'>  "MY DEAR MISS WORDSWORTH,--</a>
<a id='line_3748'></a>
<a id='line_3749'>  I wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful</a>
<a id='line_3750'>  state of mind and sweet memory of the dead, which you so happily</a>
<a id='line_3751'>  describe, as now almost begun; but I felt that it was improper, and</a>
<a id='line_3752'>  most grating to the feelings of the afflicted, to say to them that the</a>
<a id='line_3753'>  memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part, not</a>
<a id='line_3754'>  only of their dreams, but of their most wakeful sense of happiness.</a>
<a id='line_3755'>  That you would see every object with and through your lost brother,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>  and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of</a>
<a id='line_3757'>  comfort to you, I felt, and well knew, from my own experience in</a>
<a id='line_3758'>  sorrow; but till you yourself began to feel this, I did not dare to</a>
<a id='line_3759'>  tell you so; but I send you some poor lines, which I wrote under this</a>
<a id='line_3760'>  conviction of mind, and before I heard Coleridge was returning home.</a>
<a id='line_3761'></a>
<a id='line_3762'>  ...</a>

<a id='line_3767'>    Their woes, and gently bring a ray</a>
<a id='line_3768'>    (So happily he'd time relief,)</a>
<a id='line_3769'>    Of comfort from their very grief.</a>
<a id='line_3770'>    He'd tell them that their brother dead,</a>
<a id='line_3771'>    When years have passed o'er their head,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>    Will be remembered with such holy,</a>
<a id='line_3773'>    True and tender melancholy,</a>
<a id='line_3774'>    That ever this lost brother John</a>

<a id='line_3840'>  Some nook where they had made their final stand,                  30</a>

<a id='line_4083'>For the date of this poem in the Chronological Tables given in the</a>
<a id='line_4084'>editions of 1815 and 1820, Wordsworth assigned the year 1802. But, in</a>
<a id='line_4085'>the edition of 1836, he assigned it to the year 1805, the date retained</a>
<a id='line_4086'>by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857. Captain Wordsworth perished on the</a>
<a id='line_4087'>5th of February 1805; and if the poem was written in 1805, it must have</a>
<a id='line_4088'>been in the month of January of that year. The note to the poem is</a>
<a id='line_4089'>explicit--"Not long after" he "perished by shipwreck," etc. Thus the</a>
<a id='line_4090'>poem _may_ have been written in the beginning of 1805; but it is not at</a>
<a id='line_4091'>all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year.</a>
<a id='line_4092'>John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town-end</a>
<a id='line_4093'>Cottage, Grasmere, during part of the winter, and during the whole of</a>
<a id='line_4094'>the spring, summer, and autumn of 1800, William and John going together</a>
<a id='line_4095'>on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the 7th of June. John</a>
<a id='line_4096'>left Grasmere on Michaelmas day (September 29th) 1800, and never</a>
<a id='line_4097'>returned to it again. The following is Miss Wordsworth's record of that</a>
<a id='line_4098'>day in her Journal of 1800:</a>
<a id='line_4099'></a>
<a id='line_4100'>  "On Monday, 29th, John left us. William and I parted with him in sight</a>
<a id='line_4101'>  of Ullswater. It was a fine day, showery, but with sunshine and fine</a>
<a id='line_4102'>  clouds. Poor fellow, my heart was right sad, I could not help thinking</a>
<a id='line_4103'>  we should see him again, because he was only going to Penrith."</a>
<a id='line_4104'></a>
<a id='line_4105'>In the spring of 1801, John Wordsworth sailed for China in the</a>
<a id='line_4106'>'Abergavenny'.  He returned from this voyage in safety, and the brothers</a>
<a id='line_4107'>met once again in London. He went to sea again in 1803, and returned to</a>
<a id='line_4108'>London in 1804, but could not visit Grasmere; and in the month of</a>
<a id='line_4109'>February 1805--shortly after he was appointed to the command of the</a>
<a id='line_4110'>'Abergavenny'--the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland, and every one</a>
<a id='line_4111'>on board perished. It is clear that the latter part of the poem, "When,</a>
<a id='line_4112'>to the attractions of the busy world," was written between John</a>
<a id='line_4113'>Wordsworth's departure from Grasmere and the loss of the 'Abergavenny',</a>
<a id='line_4114'>i. e. between September 1800 and February 1805, as there are references</a>
<a id='line_4115'>in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to</a>
<a id='line_4116'>sea:</a>
<a id='line_4117'></a>
<a id='line_4118'>  'Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone.'</a>
<a id='line_4119'></a>
<a id='line_4120'>There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to</a>
<a id='line_4121'>negative the idea of its having been written in 1800. The opening lines</a>
<a id='line_4122'>seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant. He speaks of being</a>
<a id='line_4123'>"wont" to do certain things. But, on the other hand, I find an entry in</a>
<a id='line_4124'>Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, which leads me to believe that the poem</a>
<a id='line_4125'>may have been begun in 1800, and that the first part, ending (as it did</a>
<a id='line_4126'>then) with the line:</a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'>  'While she is travelling through the dreary sea,'</a>
<a id='line_4129'></a>
<a id='line_4130'>may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere;</a>
<a id='line_4131'>the second part being written afterwards, while he was at sea;</a>
<a id='line_4132'>and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions</a>
<a id='line_4133'>of 1815 and 1820, viz. 1802.</a>
<a id='line_4134'></a>
<a id='line_4135'>Passages occur in Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal to the</a>
<a id='line_4136'>following effect:</a>
<a id='line_4137'></a>
<a id='line_4138'>  "Monday Morning, 1st September.--We walked in the wood by the lake.</a>
<a id='line_4139'>  William read 'Joanna' and 'the Firgrove' to Coleridge."</a>
<a id='line_4140'></a>
<a id='line_4141'>A little earlier there is the record,</a>
<a id='line_4142'></a>
<a id='line_4143'>  "Saturday, 22nd August.--William was composing all the morning....</a>
<a id='line_4144'>  William read us the poem of 'Joanna' beside the Rothay by the</a>
<a id='line_4145'>  roadside."</a>
<a id='line_4146'></a>
<a id='line_4147'>Then, on Friday, the 25th August, there is the entry,</a>
<a id='line_4148'></a>
<a id='line_4149'>  "We walked over the hill by the Firgrove, I sate upon a rock and</a>
<a id='line_4150'>  observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head.</a>
<a id='line_4151'>  We walked through the wood to the stepping stones, the lake of Rydale</a>
<a id='line_4152'>  very beautiful, partly still, I left William to compose an</a>
<a id='line_4153'>  inscription, that about the path...."</a>
<a id='line_4154'></a>
<a id='line_4155'>Then, next day,</a>
<a id='line_4156'></a>
<a id='line_4157'>  "Saturday morning, 30th August.--William finished his inscription of</a>
<a id='line_4158'>  the Pathway, then walked in the wood, and when John returned he sought</a>
<a id='line_4159'>  him, and they bathed together."</a>
<a id='line_4160'></a>
<a id='line_4161'>To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the</a>
<a id='line_4162'>"Inscription of the Pathway" has puzzled me much. There is no poem</a>
<a id='line_4163'>amongst his "Inscriptions" (written in or before August 1800) that</a>
<a id='line_4164'>corresponds to it in the least. But, if my conjecture is right that this</a>
<a id='line_4165'>"Poem on the Naming of Places," beginning:</a>
<a id='line_4166'></a>
<a id='line_4167'>  'When, to the attractions of the busy world,'</a>
<a id='line_4168'></a>
<a id='line_4169'>was composed at two different times, it is quite possible that "the</a>
<a id='line_4170'>Firgrove" which was read--along with 'Joanna'--to Coleridge on September</a>
<a id='line_4171'>1st, 1800, was the first part of this very poem.</a>
<a id='line_4172'></a>
<a id='line_4173'>If this supposition is correct, some light is cast both on the</a>
<a id='line_4174'>"Inscription of the Pathway." and on the date assigned by Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_4175'>himself to the poem. There is a certain fitness, however, in this poem</a>
<a id='line_4176'>being placed--as it now is--in sequence to the 'Elegiac Verses' in</a>
<a id='line_4177'>memory of John Wordsworth, beginning, "The Sheep-boy whistled loud," and</a>
<a id='line_4178'>near the fourth poem 'To the Daisy', beginning, "Sweet Flower! belike</a>
<a id='line_4179'>one day to have."</a>
<a id='line_4180'></a>
<a id='line_4181'>The "Fir-grove" still exists. It is between Wishing Gate and White Moss</a>
<a id='line_4182'>Common, and almost exactly opposite the former. Standing at the gate and</a>
<a id='line_4183'>looking eastwards, the grove is to the left, not forty yards distant.</a>
<a id='line_4184'>Some of the firs (Scotch ones) still survive, and several beech trees,</a>
<a id='line_4185'>not "a single beech-tree," as in the poem. From this, one might infer</a>
<a id='line_4186'>that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_4187'>century, and that the special tree, in which was the thrush's nest, had</a>
<a id='line_4188'>perished; but Dr. Cradock wrote to me that "Wordsworth pointed out the</a>
<a id='line_4189'>tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora Wordsworth's death. The tree</a>
<a id='line_4190'>is near the upper wall and tells its own tale." The Fir-grove--"John's</a>
<a id='line_4191'>Grove"--can easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond</a>
<a id='line_4192'>the Wishing-gate, as one goes toward Rydal. The view from it, the</a>
<a id='line_4193'>"visionary scene,"</a>
<a id='line_4194'></a>
<a id='line_4195'>                           'the spectacle</a>
<a id='line_4196'>  Of clouded splendour, ... this dream-like sight</a>
<a id='line_4197'>  Of solemn loveliness,'</a>
<a id='line_4198'></a>
<a id='line_4199'>is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately</a>
<a id='line_4200'>below the firs. It must have been very different in Wordsworth's time,</a>
<a id='line_4201'>and is constantly referred to in his sister's Journal as a favourite</a>
<a id='line_4202'>retreat, resorted to</a>
<a id='line_4203'></a>
<a id='line_4204'>                           'when cloudless suns</a>
<a id='line_4205'>  Shone hot, or wind blew troublesome and strong.'</a>
<a id='line_4206'></a>
<a id='line_4207'>In the absence of contrary testimony, it might be supposed that "the</a>
<a id='line_4208'>track" which the brother had "worn,"</a>
<a id='line_4209'></a>
<a id='line_4210'>  'By pacing here, unwearied and alone,'</a>
<a id='line_4211'></a>
<a id='line_4212'>faced Silver-How and the Grasmere Island, and that the single beech tree</a>
<a id='line_4213'>was nearer the lower than the upper wall. But Miss Cookson's testimony</a>
<a id='line_4214'>is explicit. Only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove,</a>
<a id='line_4215'>which is now open and desolate, not as it was in those earlier days,</a>
<a id='line_4216'>when</a>
<a id='line_4217'></a>
<a id='line_4218'>                                  'the trees</a>
<a id='line_4219'>  Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven</a>
<a id='line_4220'>  With such perplexed and intricate array,</a>
<a id='line_4221'>  That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems</a>
<a id='line_4222'>  A length of open space ...'</a>
<a id='line_4223'></a>
<a id='line_4224'>Dr. Cradock remarks,</a>
<a id='line_4225'></a>
<a id='line_4226'>  "As to there being more than one beech, Wordsworth would not have</a>
<a id='line_4227'>  hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect." He had a</a>
<a id='line_4228'>  fancy for "one"--</a>
<a id='line_4229'></a>
<a id='line_4230'>    'Fair as a star when only one</a>
<a id='line_4231'>    Is shining in the sky;'</a>

<a id='line_4285'>This poem underwent no change in successive editions. The title in all</a>
<a id='line_4286'>the earlier ones (1815 to 1843) was 'The Cottager to her Infant. By a</a>
<a id='line_4287'>Female Friend'; and in the preface to the edition of 1815, Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_4288'>wrote,</a>
<a id='line_4289'></a>
<a id='line_4290'>  "Three short pieces (now first published) are the work of a Female</a>
<a id='line_4291'>  Friend; ... if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to</a>
<a id='line_4292'>  condemn them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own</a>
<a id='line_4293'>  sense of their merit, and their fitness for the place which they</a>
<a id='line_4294'>  occupy, _extorted_ them from the Authoress."</a>
<a id='line_4295'></a>
<a id='line_4296'>In the edition of 1845, he disclosed the authorship; and gave the more</a>
<a id='line_4297'>natural title, 'By my Sister'. Other two poems by her were introduced</a>
<a id='line_4298'>into the edition of 1815, and subsequent ones, viz. the 'Address to a</a>
<a id='line_4299'>Child', and 'The Mother's Return'. In an appendix to a MS. copy of the</a>
<a id='line_4300'>'Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland', by Dorothy Wordsworth,</a>
<a id='line_4301'>transcribed by Mrs. Clarkson, I find the poem 'The Cottager to her</a>
<a id='line_4302'>Infant' with two additional stanzas, which are there attributed to</a>
<a id='line_4303'>Wordsworth. The appendix runs thus:</a>
<a id='line_4304'></a>
<a id='line_4305'>  "To my Niece Dorothy, a sleepless Baby</a>
<a id='line_4306'></a>
<a id='line_4307'>    THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT</a>

<a id='line_4355'>MY DEAR FRIEND,</a>
<a id='line_4356'></a>
<a id='line_4357'>When I sent you, a few weeks ago, the Tale of 'Peter Bell', you asked</a>
<a id='line_4358'>"why THE WAGGONER was not added?"--To say the truth,--from the higher</a>
<a id='line_4359'>tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the</a>
<a id='line_4360'>former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without</a>
<a id='line_4361'>disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, THE WAGGONER was</a>
<a id='line_4362'>read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered it for so long a</a>
<a id='line_4363'>time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on</a>
<a id='line_4364'>which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you, it</a>
<a id='line_4365'>may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure the</a>
<a id='line_4366'>cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the gratification of</a>
<a id='line_4367'>inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived</a>
<a id='line_4368'>from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which</a>

<a id='line_4497'>    Now am I fairly safe to-night--110</a>
<a id='line_4498'>  And with proud cause my heart is light: [15]</a>
<a id='line_4499'>  I trespassed lately worse than ever--</a>

<a id='line_4505'>  My jolly team, he finds that ye</a>

<a id='line_4507'>  Full proof of this the Country gained;                           120</a>
<a id='line_4508'>  It knows how ye were vexed and strained,</a>
<a id='line_4509'>  And forced unworthy stripes to bear,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>  When trusted to another's care. [18]</a>
<a id='line_4511'>  Here was it--on this rugged slope,</a>
<a id='line_4512'>  Which now ye climb with heart and hope,                          125</a>
<a id='line_4513'>  I saw you, between rage and fear,</a>
<a id='line_4514'>  Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,</a>
<a id='line_4515'>  And ever more and more confused,</a>
<a id='line_4516'>  As ye were more and more abused: [19]</a>
<a id='line_4517'>  As chance would have it, passing by                              130</a>
<a id='line_4518'>  I saw you in that [20] jeopardy:</a>
<a id='line_4519'>  A word from me was like a charm; [D]</a>
<a id='line_4520'>  Ye pulled together with one mind; [21]</a>
<a id='line_4521'>  And your huge burthen, safe from harm,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>  Moved like a vessel in the wind!                                 135</a>
<a id='line_4523'>  --Yes, without me, up hills so high</a>
<a id='line_4524'>  'Tis vain to strive for mastery.</a>
<a id='line_4525'>  Then grieve not, jolly team! though tough</a>
<a id='line_4526'>  The road we travel, steep, and rough; [22]</a>
<a id='line_4527'>  Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise,                          140</a>
<a id='line_4528'>  And all their fellow banks and braes,</a>
<a id='line_4529'>  Full often make you stretch and strain,</a>
<a id='line_4530'>  And halt for breath and halt again,</a>
<a id='line_4531'>  Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing</a>
<a id='line_4532'>  That side by side we still are going!                            145</a>
<a id='line_4533'></a>
<a id='line_4534'>    While Benjamin in earnest mood</a>
<a id='line_4535'>  His meditations thus pursued,</a>
<a id='line_4536'>  A storm, which had been smothered long,</a>
<a id='line_4537'>  Was growing inwardly more strong;</a>
<a id='line_4538'>  And, in its struggles to get free,                               150</a>
<a id='line_4539'>  Was busily employed as he.</a>
<a id='line_4540'>  The thunder had begun to growl--</a>
<a id='line_4541'>  He heard not, too intent of soul;</a>
<a id='line_4542'>  The air was now without a breath--</a>
<a id='line_4543'>  He marked not that 'twas still as death.                         155</a>
<a id='line_4544'>  But soon large rain-drops on his head [23]</a>
<a id='line_4545'>  Fell with the weight of drops of lead;--</a>
<a id='line_4546'>  He starts--and takes, at the admonition,</a>
<a id='line_4547'>  A sage survey of his condition. [24]</a>
<a id='line_4548'>  The road is black before his eyes,                               160</a>
<a id='line_4549'>  Glimmering faintly where it lies;</a>
<a id='line_4550'>  Black is the sky--and every hill,</a>
<a id='line_4551'>  Up to the sky, is blacker still--</a>
<a id='line_4552'>  Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room, [25]</a>
<a id='line_4553'>  Hung round and overhung with gloom;                              165</a>
<a id='line_4554'>  Save that above a single height</a>
<a id='line_4555'>  Is to be seen a lurid light,</a>
<a id='line_4556'>  Above Helm-crag [E]--a streak half dead,</a>
<a id='line_4557'>  A burning of portentous red;</a>
<a id='line_4558'>  And near that lurid light, full well                             170</a>
<a id='line_4559'>  The ASTROLOGER, sage Sidrophel,</a>
<a id='line_4560'>  Where at his desk and book he sits,</a>
<a id='line_4561'>  Puzzling aloft [26] his curious wits;</a>
<a id='line_4562'>  He whose domain is held in common</a>
<a id='line_4563'>  With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,                               175</a>
<a id='line_4564'>  Cowering beside her rifted cell,</a>
<a id='line_4565'>  As if intent on magic spell;-</a>
<a id='line_4566'>  Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,</a>
<a id='line_4567'>  Still sit upon Helm-crag together!</a>
<a id='line_4568'></a>
<a id='line_4569'>    The ASTROLOGER was not unseen                                  180</a>
<a id='line_4570'>  By solitary Benjamin;</a>
<a id='line_4571'>  But total darkness came anon,</a>
<a id='line_4572'>  And he and every thing was gone:</a>
<a id='line_4573'>  And suddenly a ruffling breeze,</a>
<a id='line_4574'>  (That would have rocked the sounding trees                       185</a>
<a id='line_4575'>  Had aught of sylvan growth been there)</a>
<a id='line_4576'>  Swept through the Hollow long and bare: [27]</a>
<a id='line_4577'>  The rain rushed down--the road was battered,</a>
<a id='line_4578'>  As with the force of billows shattered;</a>
<a id='line_4579'>  The horses are dismayed, nor know                                190</a>
<a id='line_4580'>  Whether they should stand or go;</a>
<a id='line_4581'>  And Benjamin is groping near them,</a>
<a id='line_4582'>  Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.</a>
<a id='line_4583'>  He is astounded,--wonder not,--</a>
<a id='line_4584'>  With such a charge in such a spot;                               195</a>
<a id='line_4585'>  Astounded in the mountain gap</a>
<a id='line_4586'>  With thunder-peals, clap after clap,</a>
<a id='line_4587'>  Close-treading on the silent flashes--</a>
<a id='line_4588'>  And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes [28]</a>
<a id='line_4589'>  Among the rocks; with weight of rain,                            200</a>
<a id='line_4590'>  And sullen [29] motions long and slow,</a>
<a id='line_4591'>  That to a dreary distance go--</a>
<a id='line_4592'>  Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,</a>
<a id='line_4593'>  A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.</a>
<a id='line_4594'></a>
<a id='line_4595'>    Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,                               205</a>
<a id='line_4596'>  And oftentimes compelled to halt,</a>
<a id='line_4597'>  The horses cautiously pursue</a>
<a id='line_4598'>  Their way, without mishap or fault;</a>
<a id='line_4599'>  And now have reached that pile of stones,</a>
<a id='line_4600'>  Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;                          210</a>
<a id='line_4601'>  He who had once supreme command,</a>
<a id='line_4602'>  Last king of rocky Cumberland;</a>
<a id='line_4603'>  His bones, and those of all his Power,</a>
<a id='line_4604'>  Slain here in a disastrous hour!</a>
<a id='line_4605'></a>
<a id='line_4606'>    When, passing through this narrow strait,                      215</a>
<a id='line_4607'>  Stony, and dark, and desolate,</a>
<a id='line_4608'>  Benjamin can faintly hear</a>
<a id='line_4609'>  A voice that comes from some one near,</a>
<a id='line_4610'>  A female voice:--"Whoe'er you be,</a>
<a id='line_4611'>  Stop," it exclaimed, "and pity me!"                              220</a>
<a id='line_4612'>  And, less in pity than in wonder,</a>
<a id='line_4613'>  Amid the darkness and the thunder,</a>
<a id='line_4614'>  The Waggoner, with prompt command,</a>
<a id='line_4615'>  Summons his horses to a stand.</a>
<a id='line_4616'></a>
<a id='line_4617'>    While, with increasing agitation,                              225</a>
<a id='line_4618'>  The Woman urged her supplication,</a>
<a id='line_4619'>  In rueful words, with sobs between--</a>
<a id='line_4620'>  The voice of tears that fell unseen; [30]</a>
<a id='line_4621'>  There came a flash--a startling glare,</a>
<a id='line_4622'>  And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare!                               230</a>
<a id='line_4623'>  'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,</a>
<a id='line_4624'>  And Benjamin, without a question,</a>
<a id='line_4625'>  Taking her for some way-worn rover, [31]</a>
<a id='line_4626'>  Said, "Mount, and get you under cover!"</a>
<a id='line_4627'>  Another voice, in tone as hoarse                                 235</a>
<a id='line_4628'>  As a swoln brook with rugged course,</a>
<a id='line_4629'>  Cried out, "Good brother, why so fast?</a>
<a id='line_4630'>  I've had a glimpse of you--'avast!'</a>
<a id='line_4631'>  Or, since it suits you to be civil,</a>
<a id='line_4632'>  Take her at once--for good and evil!"                            240</a>
<a id='line_4633'></a>
<a id='line_4634'>  "It is my Husband," softly said</a>
<a id='line_4635'>  The Woman, as if half afraid:</a>
<a id='line_4636'>  By this time she was snug within,</a>
<a id='line_4637'>  Through help of honest Benjamin;</a>
<a id='line_4638'>  She and her Babe, which to her breast                            245</a>
<a id='line_4639'>  With thankfulness the Mother pressed;</a>
<a id='line_4640'>  And now the same strong voice more near</a>
<a id='line_4641'>  Said cordially, "My Friend, what cheer?</a>
<a id='line_4642'>  Rough doings these! as God's my judge,</a>
<a id='line_4643'>  The sky owes somebody a grudge!                                  250</a>
<a id='line_4644'>  We've had in half an hour or less</a>
<a id='line_4645'>  A twelvemonth's terror [32] and distress!"</a>
<a id='line_4646'></a>
<a id='line_4647'>  Then Benjamin entreats the Man</a>
<a id='line_4648'>  Would mount, too, quickly as he can:</a>
<a id='line_4649'>  The Sailor--Sailor now no more,                                  255</a>
<a id='line_4650'>  But such he had been heretofore--</a>
<a id='line_4651'>  To courteous Benjamin replied,</a>
<a id='line_4652'>  "Go you your way, and mind not me;</a>
<a id='line_4653'>  For I must have, whate'er betide,</a>
<a id='line_4654'>  My Ass and fifty things beside,--260</a>
<a id='line_4655'>  Go, and I'll follow speedily!"</a>
<a id='line_4656'></a>
<a id='line_4657'>  The Waggon moves--and with its load</a>
<a id='line_4658'>  Descends along the sloping road;</a>
<a id='line_4659'>  And the rough Sailor instantly</a>
<a id='line_4660'>  Turns to a little tent hard by: [33]                             265</a>
<a id='line_4661'>  For when, at closing-in of day,</a>
<a id='line_4662'>  The family had come that way,</a>
<a id='line_4663'>  Green pasture and the soft warm air</a>
<a id='line_4664'>  Tempted [34] them to settle there.--</a>
<a id='line_4665'>  Green is the grass for beast to graze,                           270</a>
<a id='line_4666'>  Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!</a>
<a id='line_4667'></a>
<a id='line_4668'>  The Sailor gathers up his bed,</a>
<a id='line_4669'>  Takes down the canvass overhead;</a>
<a id='line_4670'>  And, after farewell to the place,</a>
<a id='line_4671'>  A parting word--though not of grace,                             275</a>
<a id='line_4672'>  Pursues, with Ass and all his store,</a>
<a id='line_4673'>  The way the Waggon went before.</a>
<a id='line_4674'></a>
<a id='line_4675'></a>
<a id='line_4676'></a>
<a id='line_4677'>CANTO SECOND</a>

<a id='line_5086'>  By this time near their journey's end;</a>
<a id='line_5087'>  And, after their high-minded riot,</a>
<a id='line_5088'>  Sickening into thoughtful quiet;</a>
<a id='line_5089'>  As if the morning's pleasant hour,</a>
<a id='line_5090'>  Had for their joys a killing power.                              660</a>
<a id='line_5091'>  And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein</a>

<a id='line_5102'>  With increasing vigour climb,</a>
<a id='line_5103'>  Eager to repair lost time;</a>

<a id='line_5120'>  Rising like an exhalation,</a>
<a id='line_5121'>  Blend [60] with the mist--a moving shroud                        690</a>
<a id='line_5122'>  To form, an undissolving cloud;</a>
<a id='line_5123'>  Which, with slant ray, the merry sun</a>

<a id='line_5137'>  Can destiny be turned aside?                                     705</a>
<a id='line_5138'>  No--sad progress of my story!</a>
<a id='line_5139'>  Benjamin, this outward glory</a>
<a id='line_5140'>  Cannot shield [62] thee from thy Master,</a>
<a id='line_5141'>  Who from Keswick has pricked forth,</a>
<a id='line_5142'>  Sour and surly as the north;                                     710</a>
<a id='line_5143'>  And, in fear of some disaster,</a>
<a id='line_5144'>  Comes to give what help he may,</a>
<a id='line_5145'>  And [63] to hear what thou canst say;</a>
<a id='line_5146'>  If, as needs he must forebode, [64]</a>
<a id='line_5147'>  Thou hast been loitering [65] on the road!                       715</a>
<a id='line_5148'>  His fears, his doubts, [66] may now take flight--</a>
<a id='line_5149'>  The wished-for object is in sight;</a>
<a id='line_5150'>  Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath</a>
<a id='line_5151'>  Stirred him up to livelier wrath;</a>
<a id='line_5152'>  Which he stifles, moody man!                                     720</a>
<a id='line_5153'>  With all the patience that he can;</a>
<a id='line_5154'>  To the end that, at your meeting,</a>
<a id='line_5155'>  He may give thee decent greeting.</a>
<a id='line_5156'></a>
<a id='line_5157'>    There he is--resolved to stop,</a>
<a id='line_5158'>  Till the waggon gains the top;                                   725</a>
<a id='line_5159'>  But stop he cannot--must advance:</a>
<a id='line_5160'>  Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,</a>
<a id='line_5161'>  Espies--and instantly is ready,</a>
<a id='line_5162'>  Self-collected, poised, and steady:</a>
<a id='line_5163'>  And, to be the better seen,                                      730</a>
<a id='line_5164'>  Issues from his radiant shroud,</a>
<a id='line_5165'>  From his close-attending cloud,</a>
<a id='line_5166'>  With careless air and open mien.</a>
<a id='line_5167'>  Erect his port, and firm his going;</a>
<a id='line_5168'>  So struts yon cock that now is crowing;                          735</a>
<a id='line_5169'>  And the morning light in grace</a>
<a id='line_5170'>  Strikes upon his lifted face,</a>
<a id='line_5171'>  Hurrying the pallid hue away</a>
<a id='line_5172'>  That might his trespasses betray.</a>
<a id='line_5173'>  But what can all avail to clear him,                             740</a>
<a id='line_5174'>  Or what need of explanation,</a>
<a id='line_5175'>  Parley or interrogation?</a>
<a id='line_5176'>  For the Master sees, alas!</a>
<a id='line_5177'>  That unhappy Figure near him,</a>
<a id='line_5178'>  Limping o'er the dewy grass,                                     745</a>
<a id='line_5179'>  Where the road it fringes, sweet,</a>
<a id='line_5180'>  Soft and cool to way-worn feet;</a>
<a id='line_5181'>  And, O indignity! an Ass,</a>
<a id='line_5182'>  By his noble Mastiffs side,</a>
<a id='line_5183'>  Tethered to the waggon's tail:                                   750</a>
<a id='line_5184'>  And the ship, in all her pride,</a>
<a id='line_5185'>  Following after in full sail!</a>
<a id='line_5186'>  Not to speak of babe and mother;</a>
<a id='line_5187'>  Who, contented with each other,</a>
<a id='line_5188'>  And snug as birds in leafy arbour,                               755</a>
<a id='line_5189'>  Find, within, a blessed harbour!</a>
<a id='line_5190'></a>
<a id='line_5191'>    With eager eyes the Master pries;</a>
<a id='line_5192'>  Looks in and out, and through and through;</a>
<a id='line_5193'>  Says nothing--till at last he spies</a>
<a id='line_5194'>  A wound upon the Mastiff's head,                                 760</a>
<a id='line_5195'>  A wound, where plainly might be read</a>
<a id='line_5196'>  What feats an Ass's hoof can do!</a>
<a id='line_5197'>  But drop the rest:--this aggravation,</a>
<a id='line_5198'>  This complicated provocation,</a>
<a id='line_5199'>  A hoard of grievances unsealed;                                  765</a>
<a id='line_5200'>  All past forgiveness it repealed;</a>
<a id='line_5201'>  And thus, and through distempered blood</a>
<a id='line_5202'>  On both sides, Benjamin the good,</a>
<a id='line_5203'>  The patient, and the tender-hearted,</a>
<a id='line_5204'>  Was from his team and waggon parted;                             770</a>
<a id='line_5205'>  When duty of that day was o'er,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>  Laid down his whip--and served no more.--</a>
<a id='line_5207'>  Nor could the waggon long survive,</a>
<a id='line_5208'>  Which Benjamin had ceased to drive:</a>
<a id='line_5209'>  It lingered on;--guide after guide                               775</a>
<a id='line_5210'>  Ambitiously the office tried;</a>
<a id='line_5211'>  But each unmanageable hill</a>
<a id='line_5212'>  Called for _his_ patience and _his_ skill;--</a>
<a id='line_5213'>  And sure it is, that through this night,</a>
<a id='line_5214'>  And what the morning brought to light,                           780</a>
<a id='line_5215'>  Two losses had we to sustain,</a>
<a id='line_5216'>  We lost both WAGGONER and WAIN!</a>

<a id='line_5220'>  Accept, O Friend, for praise or blame,</a>
<a id='line_5221'>  The gift of this adventurous song;</a>
<a id='line_5222'>  A record which I dared to frame,                                 785</a>
<a id='line_5223'>  Though timid scruples checked me long;</a>
<a id='line_5224'>  They checked me--and I left the theme</a>
<a id='line_5225'>  Untouched;--in spite of many a gleam</a>
<a id='line_5226'>  Of fancy which thereon was shed,</a>
<a id='line_5227'>  Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still                            790</a>
<a id='line_5228'>  Upon the side of a distant hill:</a>
<a id='line_5229'>  But Nature might not be gainsaid;</a>
<a id='line_5230'>  For what I have and what I miss</a>
<a id='line_5231'>  I sing of these;--it makes my bliss!</a>
<a id='line_5232'>  Nor is it I who play the part,                                   795</a>
<a id='line_5233'>  But a shy spirit in my heart,</a>
<a id='line_5234'>  That comes and goes--will sometimes leap</a>
<a id='line_5235'>  From hiding-places ten years deep;</a>
<a id='line_5236'>  Or haunts me with familiar face, [67]</a>
<a id='line_5237'>  Returning, like a ghost unlaid,                                  800</a>
<a id='line_5238'>  Until the debt I owe be paid.</a>

<a id='line_5243'>  A living almanack had we;</a>
<a id='line_5244'>  We had a speaking diary,</a>
<a id='line_5245'>  That in this uneventful place,</a>
<a id='line_5246'>  Gave to the days a mark and name</a>

<a id='line_5248'>--Yes, I, and all about me here,</a>

<a id='line_5278'>  The summit of a cumbrous freight,</a>

<a id='line_6062'>Several years after the event that forms the subject of the foregoing</a>
<a id='line_6063'>poem, in company with my friend, the late Mr. Coleridge, I happened to</a>
<a id='line_6064'>fall in with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given. Upon our</a>
<a id='line_6065'>expressing regret that we had not, for a long time, seen upon the road</a>
<a id='line_6066'>either him or his waggon, he said:--"They could not do without me; and</a>
<a id='line_6067'>as to the man who was put in my place, no good could come out of him; he</a>
<a id='line_6068'>was a man of no _ideas_."</a>
<a id='line_6069'></a>
<a id='line_6070'>The fact of my discarded hero's getting the horses out of a great</a>
<a id='line_6071'>difficulty with a word, as related in the poem, was told me by an</a>
<a id='line_6072'>eye-witness.</a>

<a id='line_6081'>  'The Night-hawk is singing his frog-like tune,</a>
<a id='line_6082'>  Twirling his watchman's rattle about--'</a>
<a id='line_6083'></a>
<a id='line_6084'>but from unwillingness to startle the reader at the outset by so bold a</a>
<a id='line_6085'>mode of expression, the passage was altered as it now stands.</a>

<a id='line_6091'>an incident which has been kept back. Part of the suppressed verses</a>
<a id='line_6092'>shall here be given as a gratification of private feeling, which the</a>
<a id='line_6093'>well-disposed reader will find no difficulty in excusing. They are now</a>
<a id='line_6094'>printed for the first time.</a>
<a id='line_6095'></a>
<a id='line_6096'>  Can any mortal clog come to her?</a>
<a id='line_6097'>  It can: ...</a>
<a id='line_6098'>  ...</a>
<a id='line_6099'>  But Benjamin, in his vexation,</a>
<a id='line_6100'>  Possesses inward consolation;</a>
<a id='line_6101'>  He knows his ground, and hopes to find</a>
<a id='line_6102'>  A spot with all things to his mind,</a>
<a id='line_6103'>  An upright mural block of stone,</a>

<a id='line_6151'>There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of</a>
<a id='line_6152'>the English Lakes--and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick--than 'The</a>
<a id='line_6153'>Waggoner' is, and in none are the topographical allusions more minute</a>
<a id='line_6154'>and faithful.</a>
<a id='line_6155'></a>
<a id='line_6156'>Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what "class" of his poems to</a>
<a id='line_6157'>place 'The Waggoner;' and his frequent changes--removing it from one</a>
<a id='line_6158'>group to another--shew the artificial character of these classes. Thus,</a>
<a id='line_6159'>in the edition of 1820, it stood first among the "Poems of the Fancy."</a>
<a id='line_6160'>In 1827 it was the last of the "Poems founded on the Affections." In</a>
<a id='line_6161'>1832 it was reinstated among the "Poems of the Fancy." In 1836 it had a</a>
<a id='line_6162'>place of its own, and was inserted between the "Poems of the Fancy" and</a>
<a id='line_6163'>those "Founded on the Affections;" while in 1845 it was sent back to its</a>
<a id='line_6164'>original place among the "Poems of the Fancy;" although in the table of</a>
<a id='line_6165'>contents it was printed as an independent poem, closing the series.</a>
<a id='line_6166'></a>
<a id='line_6167'>The original text of 'The Waggoner' underwent little change, till the</a>
<a id='line_6168'>year 1836, when it was carefully revised, and altered throughout. The</a>
<a id='line_6169'>final edition of 1845, however, reverted, in many instances--especially</a>
<a id='line_6170'>in the first canto--to the original text of 1819.</a>
<a id='line_6171'></a>
<a id='line_6172'>As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb, it may be of interest to</a>
<a id='line_6173'>note that, some six months afterwards, Lamb presented Wordsworth with a</a>
<a id='line_6174'>copy of the first edition of 'Paradise Regained' (the edition of 1671),</a>
<a id='line_6175'>writing on it the following sentence,</a>
<a id='line_6176'></a>
<a id='line_6177'>  "Charles Lamb, to the best knower of Milton, and therefore the</a>
<a id='line_6178'>  worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition.--Jan. 2nd, 1820."</a>
<a id='line_6179'></a>
<a id='line_6180'>The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June</a>
<a id='line_6181'>evening, with a thunder-storm imminent.</a>
<a id='line_6182'></a>
<a id='line_6183'>  ' 'Tis spent--this burning day of June!</a>
<a id='line_6184'>  Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;</a>
<a id='line_6185'>  The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,--</a>
<a id='line_6186'>  That solitary bird</a>

<a id='line_6196'>  With a haunting and a panting,</a>
<a id='line_6197'>  Like the stifling of disease;</a>

<a id='line_6212'>rock on the right, and the "two heath-clad rocks," referred to in the</a>
<a id='line_6213'>last of the "Poems on the Naming of Places," on the left. He next passes</a>
<a id='line_6214'>"The Wishing Gate" on the left, John's Grove on the right, and descends</a>
<a id='line_6215'>by Dove Cottage--where Wordsworth lived--to Grasmere.</a>

<a id='line_6236'>As early as 1819, when the poem was first published, "this rude piece of</a>

<a id='line_6243'>As he proceeds, the storm gathers, and "struggles to get free." Road,</a>
<a id='line_6244'>hill, and sky are dark; and he barely sees the well-known rocks at the</a>
<a id='line_6245'>summit of Helm-crag, where two figures seem to sit, like those on the</a>
<a id='line_6246'>Cobbler, near Arrochar, in Argyle.</a>

<a id='line_6248'>  'Black is the sky--and every hill,</a>
<a id='line_6249'>  Up to the sky, is blacker still--</a>

<a id='line_6254'>  Above Helm-crag--a streak half dead,</a>
<a id='line_6255'>  A burning of portentous red;</a>

<a id='line_6267'>At the top of the "raise"--the water-shed between the vales of Grasmere</a>
<a id='line_6268'>and Wytheburn--he reaches the familiar pile of stones, at the boundary</a>
<a id='line_6269'>between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland.</a>
<a id='line_6270'></a>
<a id='line_6271'>  '... that pile of stones,</a>
<a id='line_6272'>  Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;</a>

<a id='line_6276'></a>
<a id='line_6277'>The allusion to Seat-Sandal laid bare by the flash of lightning, and the</a>
<a id='line_6278'>description, in the last canto, of the ascent of the Raise by the</a>
<a id='line_6279'>Waggoner on a summer morning, are as true to the spirit of the place as</a>
<a id='line_6280'>anything that Wordsworth has written. He tells his friend Lamb, fourteen</a>
<a id='line_6281'>years after he wrote the poem of 'The Waggoner,'</a>
<a id='line_6282'></a>
<a id='line_6283'>  'Yes, I, and all about me here,</a>
<a id='line_6284'>  Through all the changes of the year,</a>
<a id='line_6285'>  Had seen him through the mountains go,</a>
<a id='line_6286'>  In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,</a>
<a id='line_6287'>  Majestically huge and slow:</a>
<a id='line_6288'>  Or, with a milder grace adorning</a>
<a id='line_6289'>  The landscape of a summer's morning;</a>
<a id='line_6290'>  While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain</a>
<a id='line_6291'>  The moving image to detain;</a>
<a id='line_6292'>  And mighty Fairfield, with a chime</a>
<a id='line_6293'>  Of echoes, to his march kept time;</a>
<a id='line_6294'>  When little other business stirred,</a>
<a id='line_6295'>  And little other sound was heard;</a>
<a id='line_6296'>  In that delicious hour of balm,</a>
<a id='line_6297'>  Stillness, solitude, and calm,</a>
<a id='line_6298'>  While yet the valley is arrayed,</a>
<a id='line_6299'>  On this side with a sober shade;</a>

<a id='line_6306'>  As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,'</a>
<a id='line_6307'></a>
<a id='line_6308'>remains very much as it was in 1805; but the primitive simplicity and</a>
<a id='line_6309'>"lowliness" of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of</a>
<a id='line_6310'>an apse, by the removal of some of the old rafters, and by the reseating</a>
<a id='line_6311'>of the pews.</a>
<a id='line_6312'></a>
<a id='line_6313'>The Cherry Tree Tavern, where "the village Merry-night" was being</a>
<a id='line_6314'>celebrated, still stands on the eastern or Helvellyn side of the road.</a>
<a id='line_6315'>It is now a farm-house; but it will be regarded with interest from the</a>
<a id='line_6316'>description of the rustic dance, which recalls ('longo intervallo') 'The</a>
<a id='line_6317'>Jolly Beggars' of Burns. After two hours' delay at the Cherry Tree, the</a>
<a id='line_6318'>Waggoner and Sailor "coast the silent lake" of Thirlmere, and pass the</a>
<a id='line_6319'>Rock of Names.</a>
<a id='line_6320'></a>
<a id='line_6321'>This rock was, until lately, one of the most interesting memorials of</a>
<a id='line_6322'>Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District; but the</a>
<a id='line_6323'>vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water-tank, and the place which</a>
<a id='line_6324'>knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more. It was a sort of trysting</a>
<a id='line_6325'>place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick--being nearly half-way</a>
<a id='line_6326'>between the two places--and there, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other</a>
<a id='line_6327'>members of their households often met. When Coleridge left Grasmere for</a>
<a id='line_6328'>Keswick, the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock;</a>
<a id='line_6329'>and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere.</a>
<a id='line_6330'>Compare the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge's Reminiscences. ('Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_6331'>Wordsworth,' vol. ii. p. 310.)</a>
<a id='line_6332'></a>
<a id='line_6333'>The rock was on the right hand of the road, a little way past Waterhead,</a>
<a id='line_6334'>at the southern end of Thirlmere; and on it were cut the letters,</a>
<a id='line_6335'></a>
<a id='line_6336'>  W. W.</a>
<a id='line_6337'>  M. H.</a>
<a id='line_6338'>  D. W.</a>

<a id='line_6340'>  J. W.</a>
<a id='line_6341'>  S. H.</a>
<a id='line_6342'></a>
<a id='line_6343'>the initials of William Wordsworth, Mary Hutchinson, Dorothy Wordsworth,</a>
<a id='line_6344'>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Wordsworth, and Sarah Hutchinson. The</a>
<a id='line_6345'>Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799. As</a>
<a id='line_6346'>mentioned in a previous note, John Wordsworth lived with his brother and</a>
<a id='line_6347'>sister during most of that winter, and during the whole of the spring,</a>
<a id='line_6348'>summer, and autumn of 1800, leaving it finally on September 29, 1800.</a>
<a id='line_6349'>These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of</a>
<a id='line_6350'>1800. There is no record of the occurrence, and no allusion to the rock,</a>
<a id='line_6351'>in Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal of 1800. But that Journal, so</a>
<a id='line_6352'>far as I have seen it, begins on the 14th of May 1800. Almost every</a>
<a id='line_6353'>detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so</a>
<a id='line_6354'>minutely recorded in it, that I am convinced that this incident of the</a>
<a id='line_6355'>cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned, had it</a>
<a id='line_6356'>happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth's departure from</a>
<a id='line_6357'>Grasmere in September. Such references as this, for example, occur in</a>
<a id='line_6358'>the Journal:</a>
<a id='line_6359'></a>
<a id='line_6360'>  "Saturday, August 2.--William and Coleridge went to Keswick. John went</a>
<a id='line_6361'>  with them to Wytheburn, and staid all day fishing."</a>
<a id='line_6362'></a>
<a id='line_6363'>I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that</a>
<a id='line_6364'>the names were cut.</a>
<a id='line_6365'></a>
<a id='line_6366'>I may add that the late Dean of Westminster--Dean Stanley--took much</a>
<a id='line_6367'>interest in this Rock of Names; and doubt having been cast on the</a>
<a id='line_6368'>accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions, in a</a>
<a id='line_6369'>letter from Dr. Fraser, then Bishop of Manchester, which he forwarded to</a>
<a id='line_6370'>me, he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was</a>
<a id='line_6371'>wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a</a>
<a id='line_6372'>Church.</a>
<a id='line_6373'></a>
<a id='line_6374'>There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of</a>
<a id='line_6375'>preservation than this "upright mural block of stone." When one</a>
<a id='line_6376'>remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of</a>
<a id='line_6377'>William and John Wordsworth, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, possibly with</a>
<a id='line_6378'>the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth, the two Hutchinsons (Mary and</a>
<a id='line_6379'>Sarah), and that Wordsworth says of it,</a>

<a id='line_6382'>  Shapes that defied a scornful look,'</a>
<a id='line_6383'></a>
<a id='line_6384'>this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the</a>
<a id='line_6385'>group of poets that used to meet beside it, than the Stone in the</a>
<a id='line_6386'>grounds of Rydal Mount, which was spared at Wordsworth's suit, "from</a>
<a id='line_6387'>some rude beauty of its own." There was simplicity, as well as strength,</a>
<a id='line_6388'>in the way in which the initials were cut. But the stone was afterwards</a>
<a id='line_6389'>desecrated by tourists, and others, who had the audacity to scratch</a>
<a id='line_6390'>their own names or initials upon it. In 1877 I wrote, "The rock is as</a>
<a id='line_6391'>yet wonderfully free from such; and its preservation is probably due to</a>
<a id='line_6392'>the dark olive-coloured moss, with which the 'pure water trickling down'</a>
<a id='line_6393'>has covered the face of the 'mural block,' and thus secured it from</a>
<a id='line_6394'>observation, even on that highway;" but I found in the summer of 1882</a>
<a id='line_6395'>that several other names had been ruthlessly added. When the Manchester</a>
<a id='line_6396'>Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon, an effort was made to remove</a>
<a id='line_6397'>the Stone, with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the</a>
<a id='line_6398'>side of the new roadway. In the course of this attempt, the Stone was</a>
<a id='line_6399'>broken to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_6400'></a>

<a id='line_6405'>Sailor and his quaint model of the 'Vanguard' along the road toward</a>
<a id='line_6406'>Keswick. She "scents the morning air," and</a>
<a id='line_6407'></a>
<a id='line_6408'>  'Quits the slow-paced waggon's side,</a>
<a id='line_6409'>  To wander down yon hawthorn dell,</a>
<a id='line_6410'>  With murmuring Greta for her guide.'</a>
<a id='line_6411'></a>
<a id='line_6412'>The "hawthorn dell" is the upper part of the Vale of St. John.</a>
<a id='line_6413'></a>
<a id='line_6414'>  '--There doth she ken the awful form</a>
<a id='line_6415'>  Of Raven-crag--black as a storm--</a>
<a id='line_6416'>  Glimmering through the twilight pale;</a>
<a id='line_6417'>  And Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother,</a>
<a id='line_6418'>  Each peering forth to meet the other.'</a>
<a id='line_6419'></a>
<a id='line_6420'>Raven-crag is well known,--H.C. Robinson writes of it in his 'Diary' in</a>
<a id='line_6421'>1818, as "the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not</a>
<a id='line_6422'>one insignificant,"--a rock on the western side of Thirlmere, where the</a>
<a id='line_6423'>Greta issues from the lake. But there is no rock in the district now</a>
<a id='line_6424'>called by the name of Ghimmer-crag, or the crag of the Ewe-lamb. I am</a>
<a id='line_6425'>inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the "Fisher-crag" of the</a>
<a id='line_6426'>Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books. No other rock round Thirlmere can</a>
<a id='line_6427'>with any accuracy be called the "tall twin brother" of Raven-crag:</a>
<a id='line_6428'>certainly not Great How, nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell.</a>
<a id='line_6429'>Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag, as seen from Thirlmere Bridge, or from</a>
<a id='line_6430'>the high road above it; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green--in his</a>
<a id='line_6431'>Guide to the Lakes (a volume which the poet possessed)--makes use of the</a>
<a id='line_6432'>same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two</a>
<a id='line_6433'>crags, Raven and Fisher.</a>
<a id='line_6434'></a>
<a id='line_6435'>  "The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood</a>
<a id='line_6436'>  and water; and Fischer Crag, twin brother to Raven Crag, is no bad</a>
<a id='line_6437'>  object, when taken near the island called Buck's Holm"</a>
<a id='line_6438'></a>
<a id='line_6439'>('A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature', by William Green of</a>
<a id='line_6440'>Ambleside, 1810, p. 57). I cannot find any topographical allusion to a</a>
<a id='line_6441'>Ghimmer-crag in contemporary local writers. Clarke, in his 'Survey of</a>
<a id='line_6442'>the Lakes', does not mention it.</a>
<a id='line_6443'></a>
<a id='line_6444'>The Castle Rock, in the Vale of Legberthwaite, between High Fell and</a>
<a id='line_6445'>Great How, is the fairy castle of Sir Walter Scott's 'Bridal of</a>
<a id='line_6446'>Triermain'. "Nathdale Fell" is the ridge between Naddle Vale (Nathdale</a>
<a id='line_6447'>Vale) and that of St. John, now known as High Rigg. The old Hall of</a>
<a id='line_6448'>Threlkeld has long been in a state of ruinous dilapidation, the only</a>
<a id='line_6449'>habitable part of it having been for many years converted into a</a>
<a id='line_6450'>farmhouse. The remaining local allusions in 'The Waggoner' are obvious</a>
<a id='line_6451'>enough: Castrigg is the shortened form of Castlerigg, the ridge between</a>
<a id='line_6452'>Naddle Valley and Keswick.</a>
<a id='line_6453'></a>
<a id='line_6454'>In the "Reminiscences" of Wordsworth, which the Hon. Mr. Justice</a>
<a id='line_6455'>Coleridge wrote for the late Bishop of Lincoln, in 1850, there is the</a>
<a id='line_6456'>following reference to 'The Waggoner'. (See 'Memoirs', vol. ii. p. 310.)</a>
<a id='line_6457'></a>
<a id='line_6458'>  "'The Waggoner' seems a very favourite poem of his. He said his object</a>
<a id='line_6459'>  in it had not been understood. It was a play of the fancy on a</a>
<a id='line_6460'>  domestic incident, and lowly character. He wished by the opening</a>
<a id='line_6461'>  descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he</a>
<a id='line_6462'>  wished it to be read. If he failed in doing that, he wished him to lay</a>
<a id='line_6463'>  it down. He pointed out with the same view, the glowing lines on the</a>
<a id='line_6464'>  state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the</a>
<a id='line_6465'>  influence of liquor. Then he read the sickening languor of the morning</a>
<a id='line_6466'>  walk, contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature, and the songs</a>
<a id='line_6467'>  of the birds. Here he has added about six most exquisite lines."</a>
<a id='line_6468'></a>
<a id='line_6469'>The lines referred to are doubtless the eight (p. 101), beginning</a>
<a id='line_6470'></a>
<a id='line_6471'>  'Say more; for by that power a vein,'</a>
<a id='line_6472'></a>
<a id='line_6473'>which were added in the edition of 1836.</a>
<a id='line_6474'></a>
<a id='line_6475'>The following is Sara Coleridge's criticism of 'The Waggoner'. (See</a>
<a id='line_6476'>'Biographia Literaria', vol. ii. pp. 183, 184, edition 1847.)</a>
<a id='line_6477'></a>
<a id='line_6478'>  "Due honour is done to 'Peter Bell', at this time, by students of</a>
<a id='line_6479'>  poetry in general; but some, even of Mr. Wordsworth's greatest</a>
<a id='line_6480'>  admirers, do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of 'The</a>
<a id='line_6481'>  Waggoner', a poem which my dear uncle, Mr. Southey, preferred even to</a>
<a id='line_6482'>  the former. 'Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen',</a>
<a id='line_6483'>  as Lessing says: I will force my way of thinking on nobody, but take</a>
<a id='line_6484'>  the liberty, for my own gratification, to express it. The sketches of</a>
<a id='line_6485'>  hill and valley in this poem have a lightness, and spirit--an Allegro</a>
<a id='line_6486'>  touch--distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which</a>
<a id='line_6487'>  characterises Mr. Wordsworth's representations of Nature in general,</a>
<a id='line_6488'>  and from the passive tenderness of those in 'The White Doe', while it</a>
<a id='line_6489'>  harmonises well with the human interest of the piece; indeed it is the</a>
<a id='line_6490'>  harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by</a>
<a id='line_6491'>  its special admirers. In its course it describes, with bold brief</a>
<a id='line_6492'>  touches, the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick; it</a>
<a id='line_6493'>  commences with an evening storm among the mountains, presents a lively</a>
<a id='line_6494'>  interior of a country inn during midnight, and concludes after</a>
<a id='line_6495'>  bringing us in sight of St. John's Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen</a>
<a id='line_6496'>  by day-break--'Skiddaw touched with rosy light,' and the prospect from</a>
<a id='line_6497'>  Nathdale Fell 'hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn:' thus giving a</a>
<a id='line_6498'>  beautiful and well-contrasted Panorama, produced by the most delicate</a>
<a id='line_6499'>  and masterly strokes of the pencil. Well may Mr. Ruskin, a fine</a>
<a id='line_6500'>  observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural</a>
<a id='line_6501'>  appearances, speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape</a>
<a id='line_6502'>  painter of the age. But Mr. Ruskin has found how seldom the great</a>
<a id='line_6503'>  landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and</a>
<a id='line_6504'>  affections on canvas, or even successful in the introduction of human</a>
<a id='line_6505'>  figures into their foregrounds; whereas in the poetic paintings of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_6506'>  Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest;</a>
<a id='line_6507'>  certainly, in 'The Waggoner', the little sketch of human nature which</a>
<a id='line_6508'>  occupies, as it were, the front of that encircling background, the</a>
<a id='line_6509'>  picture of Benjamin and his temptations, his humble friends and the</a>
<a id='line_6510'>  mute companions of his way, has a character of its own, combining with</a>
<a id='line_6511'>  sportiveness a homely pathos, which must ever be delightful to some of</a>
<a id='line_6512'>  those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_6513'>  Wordsworth's poetry. It may be compared with the ale-house scene in</a>
<a id='line_6514'>  'Tam o'Shanter', parts of Voss's Luise, or Ovid's Baucis and Philemon;</a>
<a id='line_6515'>  though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each</a>
<a id='line_6516'>  other. The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very</a>
<a id='line_6517'>  beautifully."</a>
<a id='line_6518'></a>
<a id='line_6519'>The editor of Southey's 'Life and Correspondence'--his son, the Rev.</a>
<a id='line_6520'>Charles Cuthbert Southey--tells us, in a note to a letter from S.T.</a>
<a id='line_6521'>Coleridge to his father, that the Waggoner's name was Jackson; and that</a>
<a id='line_6522'>"all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct." This</a>
<a id='line_6523'>Jackson, after retiring from active work as waggoner, became the tenant</a>
<a id='line_6524'>of Greta Hall, where first Coleridge, and afterwards Southey lived. The</a>
<a id='line_6525'>Hall was divided into two houses, one of which Jackson occupied, and the</a>
<a id='line_6526'>other of which he let to Coleridge, who speaks thus of him in the letter</a>
<a id='line_6527'>to Southey, dated Greta Hall, Keswick, April 13, 1801:</a>
<a id='line_6528'></a>
<a id='line_6529'>  "My landlord, who dwells next door, has a very respectable library,</a>
<a id='line_6530'>  which he has put with mine; histories, encyclopedias, and all the</a>
<a id='line_6531'>  modern poetry, etc. etc. etc. A more truly disinterested man I never</a>
<a id='line_6532'>  met with; severely frugal, yet almost carelessly generous; and yet he</a>
<a id='line_6533'>  got all his money as a common carrier, by hard labour, and by pennies</a>
<a id='line_6534'>  and pennies. He is one instance among many in this country of the</a>
<a id='line_6535'>  salutary effect of the love of knowledge--he was from a boy a lover of</a>
<a id='line_6536'>  learning."</a>

<a id='line_6541'>Charles Lamb--to whom 'The Waggoner' was dedicated--wrote thus to</a>
<a id='line_6542'>Wordsworth on 7th June 1819:</a>
<a id='line_6543'></a>
<a id='line_6544'>  "My dear Wordsworth,--You cannot imagine how proud we are here of the</a>
<a id='line_6545'>  dedication. We read it twice for once that we do the poem. I mean all</a>
<a id='line_6546'>  through; yet 'Benjamin' is no common favourite; there is a spirit of</a>
<a id='line_6547'>  beautiful tolerance in it. It is as good as it was in 1806; and it</a>
<a id='line_6548'>  will be as good in 1829, if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it.</a>
<a id='line_6549'>  Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of</a>
<a id='line_6550'>  the narrative and the subject of the dedication.</a>
<a id='line_6551'>   ...</a>
<a id='line_6552'>  "I do not know which I like best,--the prologue (the latter part</a>
<a id='line_6553'>  especially) to 'P. Bell,' or the epilogue to 'Benjamin.' Yes, I tell</a>
<a id='line_6554'>  stories; I do know I like the last best; and the 'Waggoner' altogether</a>

<a id='line_6567'>  was my poor landlord Jackson, and the cause of his exchanging it for</a>
<a id='line_6568'>  the one-horse cart was just as is represented in the poem; nobody but</a>
<a id='line_6569'>  Benjamin could manage it upon these hills, and Benjamin could not</a>

<a id='line_6596'></a>
<a id='line_6597'>The following Poem was commenced in the beginning of the year 1799, and</a>
<a id='line_6598'>completed in the summer of 1805.</a>
<a id='line_6599'></a>
<a id='line_6600'>The design and occasion of the work are described by the Author in his</a>
<a id='line_6601'>Preface to the EXCURSION, first published in 1814, where he thus speaks:</a>
<a id='line_6602'></a>
<a id='line_6603'>  "Several years ago, when the Author retired to his native mountains</a>
<a id='line_6604'>  with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might</a>
<a id='line_6605'>  live, it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his</a>
<a id='line_6606'>  own mind, and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him</a>
<a id='line_6607'>  for such an employment.</a>
<a id='line_6608'></a>
<a id='line_6609'>  "As subsidiary to this preparation, he undertook to record, in verse,</a>
<a id='line_6610'>  the origin and progress of his own powers, as far as he was acquainted</a>
<a id='line_6611'>  with them.</a>
<a id='line_6612'></a>
<a id='line_6613'>  "That work, addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his</a>
<a id='line_6614'>  knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply</a>
<a id='line_6615'>  indebted, has been long finished; and the result of the investigation</a>
<a id='line_6616'>  which gave rise to it, was a determination to compose a philosophical</a>
<a id='line_6617'>  Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled</a>
<a id='line_6618'>  'The Recluse;' as having for its principal subject the sensations and</a>
<a id='line_6619'>  opinions of a poet living in retirement.</a>
<a id='line_6620'></a>
<a id='line_6621'>  "The preparatory poem is biographical, and conducts the history of the</a>
<a id='line_6622'>  Author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his</a>
<a id='line_6623'>  faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous</a>
<a id='line_6624'>  labour which he had proposed to himself; and the two works have the</a>
<a id='line_6625'>  same kind of relation to each other, if he may so express himself, as</a>
<a id='line_6626'>  the Ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic Church. Continuing this</a>
<a id='line_6627'>  allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his minor pieces, which</a>
<a id='line_6628'>  have been long before the public, when they shall be properly</a>
<a id='line_6629'>  arranged, will be found by the attentive reader to have such</a>
<a id='line_6630'>  connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to</a>
<a id='line_6631'>  the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses, ordinarily</a>
<a id='line_6632'>  included in those edifices."</a>
<a id='line_6633'></a>
<a id='line_6634'>Such was the Author's language in the year 1814.</a>
<a id='line_6635'></a>
<a id='line_6636'>It will thence be seen, that the present Poem was intended to be</a>
<a id='line_6637'>introductory to the RECLUSE, and that the RECLUSE, if completed, would</a>
<a id='line_6638'>have consisted of Three Parts. Of these, the Second Part alone, viz. the</a>
<a id='line_6639'>EXCURSION, was finished, and given to the world by the Author.</a>
<a id='line_6640'></a>
<a id='line_6641'>The First Book of the First Part of the RECLUSE still remains in</a>
<a id='line_6642'>manuscript; but the Third Part was only planned. The materials of which</a>
<a id='line_6643'>it would have been formed have, however, been incorporated, for the most</a>
<a id='line_6644'>part, in the Author's other Publications, written subsequently to the</a>
<a id='line_6645'>EXCURSION.</a>
<a id='line_6646'></a>
<a id='line_6647'>The Friend, to whom the present Poem is addressed, was the late SAMUEL</a>
<a id='line_6648'>TAYLOR COLERIDGE, who was resident in Malta, for the restoration of his</a>
<a id='line_6649'>health, when the greater part of it was composed.</a>
<a id='line_6650'></a>
<a id='line_6651'>Mr. Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he was</a>
<a id='line_6652'>abroad; and his feelings, on hearing it recited by the Author (after his</a>
<a id='line_6653'>return to his own country) are recorded in his Verses, addressed to Mr.</a>
<a id='line_6654'>Wordsworth, which will be found in the 'Sibylline Leaves,' p. 197,</a>
<a id='line_6655'>edition 1817, or 'Poetical Works, by S. T. Coleridge,' vol. i. p. 206.</a>

<a id='line_6658'></a>
<a id='line_6659'></a>
<a id='line_6660'>This "advertisement" to the first edition of 'The Prelude,' published in</a>
<a id='line_6661'>1850--the year of Wordsworth's death--was written by Mr. Carter, who</a>
<a id='line_6662'>edited the volume. Mr. Carter was for many years the poet's secretary,</a>
<a id='line_6663'>and afterwards one of his literary executors. The poem was not only kept</a>
<a id='line_6664'>back from publication during Wordsworth's life-time, but it remained</a>
<a id='line_6665'>without a title; being alluded to by himself, when he spoke or wrote of</a>
<a id='line_6666'>it, as "the poem on my own poetical education," the "poem on my own</a>
<a id='line_6667'>life," etc.</a>
<a id='line_6668'></a>
<a id='line_6669'>As 'The Prelude' is autobiographical, a large part of Wordsworth's life</a>
<a id='line_6670'>might be written in the notes appended to it; but, besides breaking up</a>
<a id='line_6671'>the text of the poem unduly, this plan has many disadvantages, and would</a>
<a id='line_6672'>render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or</a>
<a id='line_6673'>repetitive. The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the</a>
<a id='line_6674'>explanation of local, historical, and chronological allusions, or to</a>
<a id='line_6675'>references to Wordsworth's own career that are not obvious without them.</a>
<a id='line_6676'>It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the</a>
<a id='line_6677'>allusions, to minute points in ancient history, mediæval mythology, and</a>
<a id='line_6678'>contemporary politics, should be explained or left alone; but I have</a>
<a id='line_6679'>preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details, with</a>
<a id='line_6680'>which every scholar is familiar.</a>
<a id='line_6681'></a>
<a id='line_6682'>'The Prelude' was begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar,</a>
<a id='line_6683'>in Lower Saxony, where he spent part of the last winter of last century,</a>
<a id='line_6684'>and which he left on the 10th of February 1799. Only lines 1 to 45,</a>
<a id='line_6685'>however, were composed at that time; and the poem was continued at</a>
<a id='line_6686'>desultory intervals after the settlement at Grasmere, during 1800, and</a>
<a id='line_6687'>following years. Large portions of it were dictated to his devoted</a>
<a id='line_6688'>amanuenses as he walked, or sat, on the terraces of Lancrigg. Six books</a>
<a id='line_6689'>were finished by 1805.</a>
<a id='line_6690'></a>
<a id='line_6691'>  "The seventh was begun in the opening of that year; ... and the</a>
<a id='line_6692'>  remaining seven were written before the end of June 1805, when his</a>
<a id='line_6693'>  friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta, for the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_6694'>  his health."</a>
<a id='line_6695'></a>
<a id='line_6696'>(The late Bishop of Lincoln.)</a>
<a id='line_6697'></a>
<a id='line_6698'>There is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were</a>
<a id='line_6699'>written; but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date</a>
<a id='line_6700'>of the earlier ones. Writing from Grasmere to his friend Francis</a>
<a id='line_6701'>Wrangham--the letter is undated--Wordsworth says,</a>
<a id='line_6702'></a>
<a id='line_6703'>  "I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life, which will</a>
<a id='line_6704'>  take five parts or books to complete, three of which are nearly</a>
<a id='line_6705'>  finished."</a>
<a id='line_6706'></a>
<a id='line_6707'>The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was</a>
<a id='line_6708'>written "at the close of 1803, or beginning of 1804." (See 'Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_6709'>Wordsworth,' vol. i. p. 303.) There is evidence that it belongs to 1804.</a>
<a id='line_6710'>At the commencement of the seventh book, p. 247, he says:</a>
<a id='line_6711'></a>
<a id='line_6712'>  _Six changeful years_ have vanished since I first</a>
<a id='line_6713'>  Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze</a>
<a id='line_6714'>  Which met me issuing from the City's walls)</a>
<a id='line_6715'>  _A glad preamble to this Verse:_ I sang</a>
<a id='line_6716'>  Aloud, with fervour irresistible</a>
<a id='line_6717'>  Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,</a>
<a id='line_6718'>  From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side</a>
<a id='line_6719'>  To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth</a>
<a id='line_6720'>  (So willed the Muse) _a less impetuous stream,</a>
<a id='line_6721'>  That flowed awhile with unabating strength,</a>
<a id='line_6722'>  Then stopped for years; not audible again</a>
<a id='line_6723'>  Before last primrose-time._</a>
<a id='line_6724'></a>
<a id='line_6725'>I have _italicised_ the clauses which give some clue to the dates of</a>
<a id='line_6726'>composition. From these it would appear that the "glad preamble,"</a>
<a id='line_6727'>written on leaving Goslar in 1799 (which, I think, included only the</a>
<a id='line_6728'>first two paragraphs of book first), was a "short-lived transport"; but</a>
<a id='line_6729'>that "soon" afterwards "a less impetuous stream" broke forth, which,</a>
<a id='line_6730'>after the settlement at Grasmere, "flowed awhile with unabating</a>
<a id='line_6731'>strength," and then "stopped for years." Now the above passage,</a>
<a id='line_6732'>recording these things, was written in 1805, and in the late autumn of</a>
<a id='line_6733'>that year; (as is evident from the reference which immediately follows</a>
<a id='line_6734'>to the "choir of redbreasts" and the approach of winter). We must</a>
<a id='line_6735'>therefore assign the flowing of the "less impetuous stream," to 1802; in</a>
<a id='line_6736'>order to leave room for the intervening "years," in which it ceased to</a>
<a id='line_6737'>flow, till it was audible again in the spring of 1804, "last</a>
<a id='line_6738'>primrose-time."</a>
<a id='line_6739'></a>
<a id='line_6740'>A second reference to date occurs in the sixth book, p. 224, entitled</a>
<a id='line_6741'>"Cambridge and the Alps," in which he says,</a>
<a id='line_6742'></a>
<a id='line_6743'>  _Four years and thirty, told, this very week,_</a>
<a id='line_6744'>  Have I been now a sojourner on earth.</a>
<a id='line_6745'></a>
<a id='line_6746'>This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of _that_ part</a>
<a id='line_6747'>of the work, _viz._ April 1804, which corresponds exactly to the "last</a>
<a id='line_6748'>primrose-time" of the previous extract from the seventh book, in which</a>
<a id='line_6749'>he tells us that after its long silence, his Muse was heard again. So</a>
<a id='line_6750'>far Wordsworth's own allusions to the date of 'The Prelude.'</a>
<a id='line_6751'></a>
<a id='line_6752'>But there are others supplied by his own, and his sister's letters, and</a>
<a id='line_6753'>also by the Grasmere Journal. In the Dove Cottage household it was</a>
<a id='line_6754'>known, and talked of, as "the Poem to Coleridge;" and Dorothy records,</a>
<a id='line_6755'>on 11th January 1803, that her brother was working at it. On 13th</a>
<a id='line_6756'>February 1804, she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother was engaged</a>
<a id='line_6757'>on a poem on his own life, and was "going on with great rapidity." On</a>
<a id='line_6758'>the 6th of March 1804, Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey,</a>
<a id='line_6759'></a>
<a id='line_6760'>  "I am now writing a poem on my own earlier life: I have just finished</a>
<a id='line_6761'>  that part of it in which I speak of my residence at the University."</a>
<a id='line_6762'>  ... It is "better than half complete, viz. four books, amounting to</a>
<a id='line_6763'>  about 2500 lines."[A]</a>
<a id='line_6764'></a>
<a id='line_6765'>On the 24th of March, Dorothy wrote to Mrs. Clarkson, that since</a>
<a id='line_6766'>Coleridge left them (which was in January 1804), her brother had added</a>
<a id='line_6767'>1500 lines to the poem on his own life. On the 29th of April 1804,</a>
<a id='line_6768'>Wordsworth wrote to Richard Sharpe,</a>
<a id='line_6769'></a>
<a id='line_6770'>  "I have been very busy these last ten weeks: having written between</a>
<a id='line_6771'>  two and three thousand lines--accurately near three thousand--in that</a>
<a id='line_6772'>  time; namely, four books, and a third of another. I am at present at</a>
<a id='line_6773'>  the Seventh Book."</a>
<a id='line_6774'></a>
<a id='line_6775'>On the 25th December 1804, he wrote to Sir George Beaumont,</a>
<a id='line_6776'></a>
<a id='line_6777'>  "I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks."</a>
<a id='line_6778'></a>
<a id='line_6779'>We thus find that Books I. to IV. had been written by the 6th of March</a>
<a id='line_6780'>1804, that from the 19th February to the 29th of April nearly 3000 lines</a>
<a id='line_6781'>were written, that March and April were specially productive months, for</a>
<a id='line_6782'>by the 29th April he had reached Book VII. while from 16th October to</a>
<a id='line_6783'>25th December he wrote over 2000 lines.</a>
<a id='line_6784'></a>
<a id='line_6785'>Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than</a>
<a id='line_6786'>once, and a copy of some of them was given to Coleridge to take with him</a>
<a id='line_6787'>to Malta.</a>
<a id='line_6788'></a>
<a id='line_6789'>It is certain that the remaining books of 'The Prelude' were all written</a>
<a id='line_6790'>in the spring and early summer of 1805; the seventh, eighth, ninth,</a>
<a id='line_6791'>tenth, eleventh, and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle</a>
<a id='line_6792'>of April; the last 300 lines of book twelfth in the last week of April;</a>
<a id='line_6793'>and the two remaining books--the thirteenth and fourteenth--before the</a>
<a id='line_6794'>20th of May. The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir</a>
<a id='line_6795'>George Beaumont make this clear, and also cast light on matters much</a>
<a id='line_6796'>more important than the mere dates of composition.</a>
<a id='line_6797'></a>
<a id='line_6798'>  GRASMERE, Dec. 25, 1804.</a>
<a id='line_6799'></a>
<a id='line_6800'>  "My dear Sir George,--You will be pleased to hear that I have been</a>
<a id='line_6801'>  advancing with my work: I have written upwards of 2000 verses during</a>
<a id='line_6802'>  the last ten weeks. I do not know if you are exactly acquainted with</a>
<a id='line_6803'>  the plan of my poetical labour: It is twofold; first, a Poem, to be</a>
<a id='line_6804'>  called 'The Recluse;' in which it will be my object to express in</a>
<a id='line_6805'>  verse my most interesting feelings concerning man, nature, and</a>
<a id='line_6806'>  society; and next, a poem (in which I am at present chiefly engaged)</a>
<a id='line_6807'>  on _my earlier life, or the growth of my own mind,_ taken up upon a</a>
<a id='line_6808'>  large scale. This latter work I expect to have finished before the</a>
<a id='line_6809'>  month of May; and then I purpose to fall with all my might on the</a>
<a id='line_6810'>  former, which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been</a>
<a id='line_6811'>  fixed these many years. Of this poem, that of 'The Pedlar,' which</a>
<a id='line_6812'>  Coleridge read to you, is part; and I may have written of it</a>
<a id='line_6813'>  altogether about 2000 lines. It will consist, I hope, of about ten or</a>
<a id='line_6814'>  twelve thousand."</a>
<a id='line_6815'></a>
<a id='line_6816'></a>
<a id='line_6817'>  GRASMERE, May 1, 1805.</a>
<a id='line_6818'></a>
<a id='line_6819'>  "Unable to proceed with this work, [B] I turned my thoughts again to</a>
<a id='line_6820'>  the 'Poem on my own Life', and you will be glad to hear that I have</a>
<a id='line_6821'>  added 300 lines to it in the course of last week. Two books more will</a>
<a id='line_6822'>  conclude it. It will not be much less than 9000 lines,--not hundred</a>
<a id='line_6823'>  but thousand lines long,--an alarming length! and a thing</a>
<a id='line_6824'>  unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about</a>
<a id='line_6825'>  himself. It is not self-conceit, as you will know well, that has</a>
<a id='line_6826'>  induced me to do this, but real humility. I began the work because I</a>
<a id='line_6827'>  was _unprepared_ to treat _any more arduous subject_, and _diffident</a>
<a id='line_6828'>  of my own powers_. Here, at least, I hoped that to a certain degree I</a>
<a id='line_6829'>  should be sure of succeeding, as I had nothing to do but describe what</a>
<a id='line_6830'>  I had felt and thought, and therefore could not easily be bewildered.</a>
<a id='line_6831'>  This might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more</a>
<a id='line_6832'>  address; but I have done my best. If, when the work shall be finished,</a>
<a id='line_6833'>  it appears to the judicious to have redundancies, they shall be lopped</a>
<a id='line_6834'>  off, if possible; but this is very difficult to do, when a man has</a>
<a id='line_6835'>  written with thought; and this defect, whenever I have suspected it or</a>
<a id='line_6836'>  found it to exist in any writings of mine, I have always found it</a>
<a id='line_6837'>  incurable. The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception."</a>

<a id='line_6839'></a>
<a id='line_6840'>  GRASMERE, June 3, 1805.</a>
<a id='line_6841'></a>
<a id='line_6842'>  "I have the pleasure to say that I _finished my poem_ about a</a>
<a id='line_6843'>  fortnight ago. I had looked forward to the day as a most happy one;</a>
<a id='line_6844'>  ... But it was not a happy day for me; I was dejected on many</a>
<a id='line_6845'>  accounts: when I looked back upon the performance, it seemed to have a</a>
<a id='line_6846'>  dead weight about it,--the reality so far short of the expectation. It</a>
<a id='line_6847'>  was the first long labour that I had finished; and the doubt whether I</a>
<a id='line_6848'>  should ever live to write 'The Recluse', and the sense which I had of</a>
<a id='line_6849'>  this poem being so far below what I seemed capable of executing,</a>
<a id='line_6850'>  depressed me much; above all, many heavy thoughts of my poor departed</a>
<a id='line_6851'>  brother hung upon me, the joy which I should have had in showing him</a>
<a id='line_6852'>  the manuscript, and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams. I have</a>
<a id='line_6853'>  spoken of this, because it was a state of feeling new to me, the</a>
<a id='line_6854'>  occasion being new. This work may be considered as a sort of _portico_</a>
<a id='line_6855'>  to 'The Recluse', part of the same building, which I hope to be able,</a>
<a id='line_6856'>  ere long, to begin with in earnest; and if I am permitted to bring it</a>
<a id='line_6857'>  to a conclusion, and to write, further, a narrative poem of the epic</a>
<a id='line_6858'>  kind, I shall consider the task of my life as over. I ought to add,</a>
<a id='line_6859'>  that I have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of</a>
<a id='line_6860'>  so alarming a length as I apprehended."</a>
<a id='line_6861'></a>
<a id='line_6862'></a>
<a id='line_6863'>These letters explain the delay in the publication of 'The Prelude'.</a>
<a id='line_6864'>They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was</a>
<a id='line_6865'>not self-conceit, but self-diffidence. He felt unprepared as yet for the</a>
<a id='line_6866'>more arduous task he had set before himself. He saw its faults as</a>
<a id='line_6867'>clearly, or more clearly, than the critics who condemned him. He knew</a>
<a id='line_6868'>that its length was excessive. He tried to condense it; he kept it</a>
<a id='line_6869'>beside him unpublished, and occasionally revised it, with a view to</a>
<a id='line_6870'>condensation, in vain. The text received his final corrections in the</a>
<a id='line_6871'>year 1832.</a>
<a id='line_6872'></a>
<a id='line_6873'>Wordsworth's reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem,</a>
<a id='line_6874'>'The Recluse', other than 'The Excursion', during his lifetime, was a</a>
<a id='line_6875'>matter of surprise to his friends; to whom he, or the ladies of his</a>
<a id='line_6876'>household, had read portions of it. In the year 1819, Charles Lamb wrote</a>
<a id='line_6877'>to him,</a>
<a id='line_6878'></a>
<a id='line_6879'>  "If, as you say, 'The Waggoner', in some sort, came at my call, oh for</a>
<a id='line_6880'>  a potent voice to call forth 'The Recluse' from his profound</a>
<a id='line_6881'>  dormitory, where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish charge--the</a>
<a id='line_6882'>  world!"</a>
<a id='line_6883'></a>
<a id='line_6884'>('The Letters of Charles Lamb', edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. p.</a>
<a id='line_6885'>26.)</a>
<a id='line_6886'></a>
<a id='line_6887'>The admission made in the letter of May 1st, 1805, is note-worthy:</a>
<a id='line_6888'></a>
<a id='line_6889'>  "This defect" (of redundancy) "whenever I have suspected it or found</a>
<a id='line_6890'>  it to exist in any writings of mine, _I have always found incurable.</a>
<a id='line_6891'>  The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception_."</a>
<a id='line_6892'></a>
<a id='line_6893'>The actual result--in the Poem he had at length committed to</a>
<a id='line_6894'>writing--was so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise, that</a>
<a id='line_6895'>he could never be induced to publish it. He spoke of the MS. as forming</a>
<a id='line_6896'>a sort of _portico_ to his larger work--the poem on Man, Nature, and</a>
<a id='line_6897'>Society--which he meant to call 'The Recluse', and of which one portion</a>
<a id='line_6898'>only, _viz._ 'The Excursion', was finished. It is clear that throughout</a>
<a id='line_6899'>the composition of 'The Prelude', he felt that he was experimenting with</a>
<a id='line_6900'>his powers. He wished to find out whether he could construct "a literary</a>
<a id='line_6901'>work that might live," on a larger scale than his Lyrics; and it was on</a>
<a id='line_6902'>the writing of a "philosophical poem," dealing with Man and Nature, in</a>
<a id='line_6903'>their deepest aspects, that his thoughts had been fixed for many years.</a>
<a id='line_6904'>From the letter to Sir George Beaumont, December 25, 1804, it is evident</a>
<a id='line_6905'>that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this</a>
<a id='line_6906'>larger work, to which he hoped to turn "with all his might" after 'The</a>
<a id='line_6907'>Prelude' was finished, and of which he had already written about a fifth</a>
<a id='line_6908'>or a sixth (see 'Memoirs', vol. i. p. 304). This was the part known in</a>
<a id='line_6909'>the Grasmere household as "The Pedlar," a title given to it from the</a>
<a id='line_6910'>character of the Wanderer, but afterwards happily set aside. He did not</a>
<a id='line_6911'>devote himself, however, to the completion of his wider purpose,</a>
<a id='line_6912'>immediately after 'The Prelude' was finished. He wrote one book of 'The</a>
<a id='line_6913'>Recluse' which he called "Home at Grasmere"; and, though detached from</a>
<a id='line_6914'>'The Prelude', it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at</a>
<a id='line_6915'>the point where it is left off in the latter poem. It consists of 733</a>
<a id='line_6916'>lines. Two extracts from it were published in the 'Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_6917'>Wordsworth' in 1851 (vol. i. pp. 151 and 155), beginning,</a>
<a id='line_6918'></a>
<a id='line_6919'>  'On Nature's invitation do I come,'</a>
<a id='line_6920'></a>
<a id='line_6921'>and</a>
<a id='line_6922'></a>
<a id='line_6923'>  'Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak.'</a>
<a id='line_6924'></a>
<a id='line_6925'>These will be found in vol. ii. of this edition, pp. 118 and 121</a>
<a id='line_6926'>respectively.</a>
<a id='line_6927'></a>
<a id='line_6928'>The autobiographical poem remained, as already stated, during</a>
<a id='line_6929'>Wordsworth's lifetime without a title. The name finally adopted--'The</a>
<a id='line_6930'>Prelude'--was suggested by Mrs. Wordsworth, both to indicate its</a>
<a id='line_6931'>relation to the larger work, and the fact of its having been written</a>
<a id='line_6932'>comparatively early.</a>
<a id='line_6933'></a>
<a id='line_6934'>As the poem was addressed to Coleridge, it may be desirable to add in</a>
<a id='line_6935'>this place his critical verdict upon it; along with the poem which he</a>
<a id='line_6936'>wrote, on hearing Wordsworth read a portion of it to him, in the winter</a>
<a id='line_6937'>of 1806, at Coleorton.</a>
<a id='line_6938'></a>
<a id='line_6939'>In his 'Table Talk' (London, 1835, vol. ii. p. 70), Coleridge's opinion</a>
<a id='line_6940'>is recorded thus:</a>
<a id='line_6941'></a>
<a id='line_6942'>  "I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his</a>
<a id='line_6943'>  thirteen (fourteen) books on the growth of an individual</a>
<a id='line_6944'>  mind--superior, as I used to think, upon the whole to 'The Excursion'.</a>
<a id='line_6945'>  You may judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion.</a>
<a id='line_6946'>  Then the plan laid out, and, I believe, partly suggested by me, was,</a>
<a id='line_6947'>  that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose,</a>
<a id='line_6948'>  one whose principles were made up, and so prepared to deliver upon</a>
<a id='line_6949'>  authority a system of philosophy. He was to treat man as man,--a</a>
<a id='line_6950'>  subject of eye, ear, touch, and taste in contact with external nature,</a>
<a id='line_6951'>  and informing the senses from the mind, and not compounding a mind out</a>
<a id='line_6952'>  of the senses; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states</a>
<a id='line_6953'>  of society, assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he</a>
<a id='line_6954'>  approached the high civilisation of cities and towns, and opening a</a>
<a id='line_6955'>  melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice; thence</a>
<a id='line_6956'>  he was to infer and reveal the proof of, and necessity for, the whole</a>

<a id='line_6958'>  redemptive process in operation, showing how this idea reconciled all</a>
<a id='line_6959'>  the anomalies, and promised future glory and restoration. Something of</a>
<a id='line_6960'>  this sort was, I think, agreed on. It is, in substance, what I have</a>
<a id='line_6961'>  been all my life doing in my system of philosophy.</a>

<a id='line_6963'>  "I think Wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great</a>
<a id='line_6964'>  Philosopher than any man I ever knew, or, as I believe, has existed in</a>
<a id='line_6965'>  England since Milton; but it seems to me that he ought never to have</a>
<a id='line_6966'>  abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarly--perhaps, I</a>
<a id='line_6967'>  might say exclusively--fitted for him. His proper title is 'Spectator</a>

<a id='line_6978'>  Friend of the wise! and teacher of the good!</a>
<a id='line_6979'>  Into my heart have I received that lay</a>
<a id='line_6980'>  More than historic, that prophetic lay</a>

<a id='line_6982'>  Of the foundations and the building up</a>
<a id='line_6983'>  Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell</a>

<a id='line_6989'>             Theme hard as high,</a>

<a id='line_6991'>  (The first-born they of Reason and twin-birth),</a>
<a id='line_6992'>  Of tides obedient to external force,</a>
<a id='line_6993'>  And currents self-determined, as might seem,</a>

<a id='line_6997'>  The Light reflected, as a light bestowed--</a>
<a id='line_6998'>  Of fancies fair, and milder hours of youth,</a>
<a id='line_6999'>  Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought</a>

<a id='line_7014'>  When from the general heart of humankind</a>
<a id='line_7015'>  Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!</a>
<a id='line_7016'>--Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down,</a>
<a id='line_7017'>  So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm and sure,</a>
<a id='line_7018'>  From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self,</a>
<a id='line_7019'>  With light unwaning on her eyes, to look</a>
<a id='line_7020'>  Far on--herself a glory to behold.</a>

<a id='line_7022'>  Of Duty, chosen laws controlling choice,</a>
<a id='line_7023'>  Action and joy!--An Orphic song indeed,</a>

<a id='line_7040'>  Ah! as I listened with a heart forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_7041'>  The pulses of my being beat anew:</a>
<a id='line_7042'>  And even as life returns upon the drowned,</a>
<a id='line_7043'>  Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains--</a>
<a id='line_7044'>  Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe</a>
<a id='line_7045'>  Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;</a>
<a id='line_7046'>  And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope;</a>
<a id='line_7047'>  And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;</a>

<a id='line_7051'>  And all which patient toil had reared, and all,</a>
<a id='line_7052'>  Commune with thee had opened out--but flowers</a>
<a id='line_7053'>  Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier,</a>
<a id='line_7054'>  In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!</a>
<a id='line_7055'></a>
<a id='line_7056'>  ...   Eve following eve,</a>
<a id='line_7057'>  Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home</a>
<a id='line_7058'>  Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed,</a>
<a id='line_7059'>  And more desired, more precious for thy song,</a>
<a id='line_7060'>  In silence listening, like a devout child,</a>
<a id='line_7061'>  My soul lay passive, by thy various strain</a>
<a id='line_7062'>  Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,</a>
<a id='line_7063'>  With momentary stars of my own birth,</a>
<a id='line_7064'>  Fair constellated foam, [C] still darting off</a>
<a id='line_7065'>  Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea,</a>
<a id='line_7066'>  Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon.</a>
<a id='line_7067'></a>
<a id='line_7068'>    And when--O Friend! my comforter and guide!</a>
<a id='line_7069'>  Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!--</a>
<a id='line_7070'>  Thy long-sustained Song finally closed,</a>
<a id='line_7071'>  And thy deep voice had ceased--yet thou thyself</a>
<a id='line_7072'>  Wert still before my eyes, and round us both</a>
<a id='line_7073'>  That happy vision of beloved faces--</a>
<a id='line_7074'>  Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close</a>
<a id='line_7075'>  I sate, my being blended in one thought</a>
<a id='line_7076'>  (Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)</a>
<a id='line_7077'>  Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound--</a>

<a id='line_7122'>  O there is blessing in this gentle breeze,</a>
<a id='line_7123'>  A visitant that while it fans my cheek</a>
<a id='line_7124'>  Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings</a>
<a id='line_7125'>  From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.</a>
<a id='line_7126'>  Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come                       5</a>
<a id='line_7127'>  To none more grateful than to me; escaped</a>
<a id='line_7128'>  From the vast city, [A] where I long had pined</a>
<a id='line_7129'>  A discontented sojourner: now free,</a>
<a id='line_7130'>  Free as a bird to settle where I will.</a>
<a id='line_7131'>  What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale                        10</a>
<a id='line_7132'>  Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove</a>
<a id='line_7133'>  Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream</a>
<a id='line_7134'>  Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?</a>
<a id='line_7135'>  The earth is all before me. [B] With a heart</a>
<a id='line_7136'>  Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,                              15</a>
<a id='line_7137'>  I look about; and should the chosen guide</a>
<a id='line_7138'>  Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,</a>
<a id='line_7139'>  I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!</a>
<a id='line_7140'>  Trances of thought and mountings of the mind</a>
<a id='line_7141'>  Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,                                20</a>
<a id='line_7142'>  That burthen of my own unnatural self,</a>
<a id='line_7143'>  The heavy weight of many a weary day [C]</a>
<a id='line_7144'>  Not mine, and such as were not made for me.</a>
<a id='line_7145'>  Long months of peace (if such bold word accord</a>
<a id='line_7146'>  With any promises of human life),                                   25</a>
<a id='line_7147'>  Long months of ease and undisturbed delight</a>
<a id='line_7148'>  Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,</a>
<a id='line_7149'>  By road or pathway, or through trackless field,</a>
<a id='line_7150'>  Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing</a>
<a id='line_7151'>  Upon the river point me out my course?                              30</a>
<a id='line_7152'></a>
<a id='line_7153'>    Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail</a>
<a id='line_7154'>  But for a gift that consecrates the joy?</a>
<a id='line_7155'>  For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven</a>
<a id='line_7156'>  Was blowing on my body, felt within</a>
<a id='line_7157'>  A correspondent breeze, that gently moved                           35</a>
<a id='line_7158'>  With quickening virtue, but is now become</a>
<a id='line_7159'>  A tempest, a redundant energy,</a>
<a id='line_7160'>  Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,</a>
<a id='line_7161'>  And their congenial powers, that, while they join</a>
<a id='line_7162'>  In breaking up a long-continued frost,                              40</a>
<a id='line_7163'>  Bring with them vernal promises, the hope</a>
<a id='line_7164'>  Of active days urged on by flying hours,--</a>
<a id='line_7165'>  Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought</a>
<a id='line_7166'>  Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,</a>
<a id='line_7167'>  Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!                             45</a>
<a id='line_7168'></a>
<a id='line_7169'>    Thus far, O Friend! [D] did I, not used to make</a>
<a id='line_7170'>  A present joy the matter of a song,</a>
<a id='line_7171'>  Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains</a>
<a id='line_7172'>  That would not be forgotten, and are here</a>
<a id='line_7173'>  Recorded: to the open fields I told                                 50</a>
<a id='line_7174'>  A prophecy: poetic numbers came</a>
<a id='line_7175'>  Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe</a>
<a id='line_7176'>  A renovated spirit singled out,</a>
<a id='line_7177'>  Such hope was mine, for holy services.</a>
<a id='line_7178'>  My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's                  55</a>
<a id='line_7179'>  Internal echo of the imperfect sound;</a>
<a id='line_7180'>  To both I listened, drawing from them both</a>
<a id='line_7181'>  A cheerful confidence in things to come.</a>
<a id='line_7182'></a>
<a id='line_7183'>    Content and not unwilling now to give</a>
<a id='line_7184'>  A respite to this passion, I paced on                               60</a>
<a id='line_7185'>  With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,</a>
<a id='line_7186'>  To a green shady place, [E] where down I sate</a>
<a id='line_7187'>  Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice,</a>
<a id='line_7188'>  And settling into gentler happiness.</a>
<a id='line_7189'>  'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,                           65</a>
<a id='line_7190'>  With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun</a>
<a id='line_7191'>  Two hours declined towards the west; a day</a>
<a id='line_7192'>  With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,</a>
<a id='line_7193'>  And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove</a>
<a id='line_7194'>  A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts                         70</a>
<a id='line_7195'>  Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made</a>
<a id='line_7196'>  Of a known Vale, [F] whither my feet should turn,</a>
<a id='line_7197'>  Nor rest till they had reached the very door</a>
<a id='line_7198'>  Of the one cottage [G] which methought I saw.</a>
<a id='line_7199'>  No picture of mere memory ever looked                               75</a>
<a id='line_7200'>  So fair; and while upon the fancied scene</a>
<a id='line_7201'>  I gazed with growing love, a higher power</a>
<a id='line_7202'>  Than Fancy gave assurance of some work</a>
<a id='line_7203'>  Of glory there forthwith to be begun,</a>
<a id='line_7204'>  Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,                     80</a>
<a id='line_7205'>  Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,</a>
<a id='line_7206'>  Save when, amid the stately groves of oaks,</a>
<a id='line_7207'>  Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup</a>
<a id='line_7208'>  Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once</a>
<a id='line_7209'>  To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.                   85</a>
<a id='line_7210'>  From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun</a>
<a id='line_7211'>  Had almost touched the horizon; casting then</a>
<a id='line_7212'>  A backward glance upon the curling cloud</a>
<a id='line_7213'>  Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;</a>
<a id='line_7214'>  Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,                                     90</a>
<a id='line_7215'>  But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,</a>
<a id='line_7216'>  Even with the chance equipment of that hour,</a>
<a id='line_7217'>  The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale. [F]</a>
<a id='line_7218'>  It was a splendid evening, and my soul</a>
<a id='line_7219'>  Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked                    95</a>
<a id='line_7220'>  Æolian visitations; but the harp</a>
<a id='line_7221'>  Was soon defrauded, and the banded host</a>
<a id='line_7222'>  Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,</a>
<a id='line_7223'>  And lastly utter silence! "Be it so;</a>
<a id='line_7224'>  Why think of any thing but present good?" [H]                      100</a>
<a id='line_7225'>  So, like a home-bound labourer I pursued</a>
<a id='line_7226'>  My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed</a>
<a id='line_7227'>  Mild influence; nor left in me one wish</a>
<a id='line_7228'>  Again to bend the Sabbath of that time</a>
<a id='line_7229'>  To a servile yoke. What need of many words?                        105</a>
<a id='line_7230'>  A pleasant loitering journey, through three days</a>
<a id='line_7231'>  Continued, brought me to my hermitage, [I]</a>
<a id='line_7232'>  I spare to tell of what ensued, the life</a>
<a id='line_7233'>  In common things--the endless store of things,</a>
<a id='line_7234'>  Rare, or at least so seeming, every day                            110</a>
<a id='line_7235'>  Found all about me in one neighbourhood--</a>
<a id='line_7236'>  The self-congratulation, and, from morn</a>
<a id='line_7237'>  To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene. [K]</a>
<a id='line_7238'>  But speedily an earnest longing rose</a>
<a id='line_7239'>  To brace myself to some determined aim,                            115</a>
<a id='line_7240'>  Reading or thinking; either to lay up</a>
<a id='line_7241'>  New stores, or rescue from decay the old</a>
<a id='line_7242'>  By timely interference: and therewith</a>
<a id='line_7243'>  Came hopes still higher, that with outward life</a>
<a id='line_7244'>  I might endue some airy phantasies                                 120</a>
<a id='line_7245'>  That had been floating loose about for years,</a>
<a id='line_7246'>  And to such beings temperately deal forth</a>
<a id='line_7247'>  The many feelings that oppressed my heart.</a>

<a id='line_7426'>  Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport</a>
<a id='line_7427'>  A naked savage, in the thunder shower.                             300</a>

<a id='line_7429'>    Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up</a>
<a id='line_7430'>  Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:</a>
<a id='line_7431'>  Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less</a>
<a id='line_7432'>  In that beloved Vale to which erelong</a>
<a id='line_7433'>  We were transplanted [Y]--there were we let loose                  305</a>

<a id='line_7435'>  Ten birth-days, [Z] when among the mountain slopes</a>

<a id='line_7439'>  To range the open heights where woodcocks run</a>
<a id='line_7440'>  Along the smooth green turf. [b] Through half the night,</a>
<a id='line_7441'>  Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied</a>
<a id='line_7442'>  That anxious visitation;--moon and stars</a>
<a id='line_7443'>  Were shining o'er my head. I was alone,                            315</a>
<a id='line_7444'>  And seemed to be a trouble to the peace</a>
<a id='line_7445'>  That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befel</a>
<a id='line_7446'>  In these night wanderings, that a strong desire</a>
<a id='line_7447'>  O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird</a>
<a id='line_7448'>  Which was the captive of another's toil                            320</a>
<a id='line_7449'>  Became my prey; and when the deed was done</a>
<a id='line_7450'>  I heard among the solitary hills</a>
<a id='line_7451'>  Low breathings coming after me, and sounds</a>
<a id='line_7452'>  Of undistinguishable motion, steps</a>
<a id='line_7453'>  Almost as silent as the turf they trod.                            325</a>
<a id='line_7454'></a>
<a id='line_7455'>  Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale, [c]</a>
<a id='line_7456'>  Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird</a>

<a id='line_7459'>  Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung                              330</a>
<a id='line_7460'>  Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass</a>
<a id='line_7461'>  And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock</a>
<a id='line_7462'>  But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)</a>
<a id='line_7463'>  Suspended by the blast that blew amain,</a>
<a id='line_7464'>  Shouldering the naked crag, [d] oh, at that time                    335</a>
<a id='line_7465'>  While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,</a>
<a id='line_7466'>  With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind</a>
<a id='line_7467'>  Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky</a>
<a id='line_7468'>  Of earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!</a>
<a id='line_7469'></a>
<a id='line_7470'>    Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows                         340</a>
<a id='line_7471'>  Like harmony in music; there is a dark</a>
<a id='line_7472'>  Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles</a>
<a id='line_7473'>  Discordant elements, makes them cling together</a>
<a id='line_7474'>  In one society. How strange that all</a>
<a id='line_7475'>  The terrors, pains, and early miseries,                             345</a>
<a id='line_7476'>  Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused</a>
<a id='line_7477'>  Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,</a>

<a id='line_7481'>  Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;</a>
<a id='line_7482'>  Whether her fearless visitings, or those</a>
<a id='line_7483'>  That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light</a>
<a id='line_7484'>  Opening the peaceful clouds; or she may use</a>
<a id='line_7485'>  Severer interventions, ministry                                     355</a>
<a id='line_7486'>  More palpable, as best might suit her aim.</a>
<a id='line_7487'></a>
<a id='line_7488'>    One summer evening (led by her) I found</a>
<a id='line_7489'>  A little boat tied to a willow tree</a>
<a id='line_7490'>  Within a rocky cave, [e] its usual home.</a>
<a id='line_7491'>  Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in                      360</a>
<a id='line_7492'>  Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth</a>
<a id='line_7493'>  And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice</a>
<a id='line_7494'>  Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;</a>
<a id='line_7495'>  Leaving behind her still, on either side,</a>
<a id='line_7496'>  Small circles glittering idly in the moon,                          365</a>
<a id='line_7497'>  Until they melted all into one track</a>
<a id='line_7498'>  Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,</a>
<a id='line_7499'>  Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point</a>
<a id='line_7500'>  With an unswerving line, I fixed my view</a>
<a id='line_7501'>  Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,                                  370</a>
<a id='line_7502'>  The horizon's utmost boundary; far above</a>
<a id='line_7503'>  Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.</a>
<a id='line_7504'>  She was an elfin pinnace; lustily</a>
<a id='line_7505'>  I dipped my oars into the silent lake,</a>
<a id='line_7506'>  And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat                             375</a>
<a id='line_7507'>  Went heaving through the water like a swan;</a>
<a id='line_7508'>  When, from behind that craggy steep till then</a>
<a id='line_7509'>  The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,</a>
<a id='line_7510'>  As if with voluntary power instinct</a>
<a id='line_7511'>  Upreared its head. [f] I struck and struck again,                   380</a>
<a id='line_7512'>  And growing still in stature the grim shape</a>
<a id='line_7513'>  Towered up between me and the stars, and still,</a>
<a id='line_7514'>  For so it seemed, with purpose of its own</a>
<a id='line_7515'>  And measured motion like a living thing,</a>
<a id='line_7516'>  Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,                      385</a>
<a id='line_7517'>  And through the silent water stole my way</a>
<a id='line_7518'>  Back to the covert of the willow tree;</a>
<a id='line_7519'>  There in her mooring-place I left my bark,--</a>
<a id='line_7520'>  And through the meadows homeward went, in grave</a>
<a id='line_7521'>  And serious mood; but after I had seen                              390</a>
<a id='line_7522'>  That spectacle, for many days, my brain</a>
<a id='line_7523'>  Worked with a dim and undetermined sense</a>
<a id='line_7524'>  Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_7525'>  There hung a darkness, call it solitude</a>
<a id='line_7526'>  Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes                              395</a>
<a id='line_7527'>  Remained, no pleasant images of trees,</a>
<a id='line_7528'>  Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;</a>
<a id='line_7529'>  But huge and mighty forms, that do not live</a>
<a id='line_7530'>  Like living men, moved slowly through the mind</a>
<a id='line_7531'>  By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.                            400</a>
<a id='line_7532'></a>
<a id='line_7533'>    Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!</a>
<a id='line_7534'>  Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought,</a>
<a id='line_7535'>  That givest to forms and images a breath</a>
<a id='line_7536'>  And everlasting motion, not in vain</a>
<a id='line_7537'>  By day or star-light thus from my first dawn                        405</a>
<a id='line_7538'>  Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me</a>
<a id='line_7539'>  The passions that build up our human soul;</a>
<a id='line_7540'>  Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,</a>
<a id='line_7541'>  But with high objects, with enduring things--</a>
<a id='line_7542'>  With life and nature, purifying thus                                410</a>
<a id='line_7543'>  The elements of feeling and of thought,</a>
<a id='line_7544'>  And sanctifying, by such discipline,</a>
<a id='line_7545'>  Both pain and fear, until we recognise</a>
<a id='line_7546'>  A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.</a>
<a id='line_7547'>  Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me                            415</a>
<a id='line_7548'>  With stinted kindness. In November days,</a>
<a id='line_7549'>  When vapours rolling down the valley made</a>
<a id='line_7550'>  A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods</a>
<a id='line_7551'>  At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,</a>
<a id='line_7552'>  When, by the margin of the trembling lake,                          420</a>
<a id='line_7553'>  Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went</a>
<a id='line_7554'>  In solitude, such intercourse was mine;</a>
<a id='line_7555'>  Mine was it in the fields both day and night,</a>
<a id='line_7556'>  And by the waters, all the summer long.</a>
<a id='line_7557'></a>
<a id='line_7558'>    And in the frosty season, when the sun                            425</a>
<a id='line_7559'>  Was set, and visible for many a mile</a>
<a id='line_7560'>  The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,</a>
<a id='line_7561'>  I heeded not their summons: happy time</a>
<a id='line_7562'>  It was indeed for all of us--for me</a>
<a id='line_7563'>  It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud                            430</a>
<a id='line_7564'>  The village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,</a>
<a id='line_7565'>  Proud and exulting like an untired horse</a>
<a id='line_7566'>  That cares not for his home. All shod with steel,</a>
<a id='line_7567'>  We hissed along the polished ice in games</a>
<a id='line_7568'>  Confederate, imitative of the chase                                 435</a>
<a id='line_7569'>  And woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,</a>
<a id='line_7570'>  The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.</a>
<a id='line_7571'>  So through the darkness and the cold we flew,</a>
<a id='line_7572'>  And not a voice was idle; with the din</a>
<a id='line_7573'>  Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;                                 440</a>
<a id='line_7574'>  The leafless trees and every icy crag</a>
<a id='line_7575'>  Tinkled like iron; [g] while far distant hills</a>
<a id='line_7576'>  Into the tumult sent an alien sound</a>
<a id='line_7577'>  Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars</a>
<a id='line_7578'>  Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west                      445</a>
<a id='line_7579'>  The orange sky of evening died away.</a>
<a id='line_7580'>  Not seldom from the uproar I retired</a>
<a id='line_7581'>  Into a silent bay, or sportively</a>
<a id='line_7582'>  Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,</a>
<a id='line_7583'>  To cut across the reflex of a star                                  450</a>
<a id='line_7584'>  That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed</a>
<a id='line_7585'>  Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,</a>
<a id='line_7586'>  When we had given our bodies to the wind,</a>
<a id='line_7587'>  And all the shadowy banks on either side</a>
<a id='line_7588'>  Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still                  455</a>
<a id='line_7589'>  The rapid line of motion, then at once</a>
<a id='line_7590'>  Have I, reclining back upon my heels,</a>
<a id='line_7591'>  Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs</a>
<a id='line_7592'>  Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled</a>
<a id='line_7593'>  With visible motion her diurnal round!                              460</a>
<a id='line_7594'>  Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,</a>
<a id='line_7595'>  Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched</a>
<a id='line_7596'>  Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep. [h]</a>

<a id='line_7605'>  Impressed upon all forms the characters</a>
<a id='line_7606'>  Of danger or desire; and thus did make</a>

<a id='line_7614'></a>
<a id='line_7615'>    We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven</a>
<a id='line_7616'>  Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours;                          480</a>

<a id='line_7618'>  Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.</a>
<a id='line_7619'>  I could record with no reluctant voice</a>
<a id='line_7620'>  The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers</a>
<a id='line_7621'>  With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,                    485</a>
<a id='line_7622'>  True symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong</a>
<a id='line_7623'>  And unreproved enchantment led us on</a>
<a id='line_7624'>  By rocks and pools shut out from every star,</a>
<a id='line_7625'>  All the green summer, to forlorn cascades</a>

<a id='line_7627'>  --Unfading recollections! at this hour</a>

<a id='line_7635'></a>
<a id='line_7636'>    Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,</a>
<a id='line_7637'>  A ministration of your own was yours;                               500</a>

<a id='line_7658'>  Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few</a>

<a id='line_7663'>  Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!</a>
<a id='line_7664'>  Ironic diamonds,--clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,</a>
<a id='line_7665'>  A congregation piteously akin!</a>
<a id='line_7666'>  Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit,</a>
<a id='line_7667'>  Those sooty knaves, precipitated down                               530</a>
<a id='line_7668'>  With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:</a>

<a id='line_7670'>  Queens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,</a>
<a id='line_7671'>  And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained</a>
<a id='line_7672'>  By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad                                  535</a>
<a id='line_7673'>  Incessant rain was falling, or the frost</a>

<a id='line_7719'>  Through every hair-breadth in that field of light</a>
<a id='line_7720'>  New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.                          580</a>

<a id='line_7727'>  Gleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earth</a>

<a id='line_8036'>Tyson, for whom he ever afterwards cherished the warmest regard, and</a>
<a id='line_8037'>whose simple character he has immortalised. (See especially in the</a>
<a id='line_8038'>fourth book of 'The Prelude', p. 187, etc.) Wordsworth lived in her</a>
<a id='line_8039'>cottage at Hawkshead during nine eventful years. It still remains</a>
<a id='line_8040'>externally unaltered, and little, if at all, changed in the interior. It</a>
<a id='line_8041'>may be reached through a picturesque archway, near the principal inn of</a>
<a id='line_8042'>the village (The Lion); and is on the right of a small open yard, which</a>
<a id='line_8043'>is entered through this archway. To the left, a lane leads westwards to</a>
<a id='line_8044'>the open country. It is a humble dwelling of two storeys. The floor of</a>
<a id='line_8045'>the basement flat-paved with the blue flags of Coniston slate--is not</a>
<a id='line_8046'>likely to have been changed since Wordsworth's time. The present door</a>
<a id='line_8047'>with its "latch" (see book ii. l. 339), is probably the same as that</a>

<a id='line_8146'>  Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much</a>
<a id='line_8147'>  Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace</a>
<a id='line_8148'>  The simple ways in which my childhood walked;</a>
<a id='line_8149'>  Those chiefly that first led me to the love</a>
<a id='line_8150'>  Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet                        5</a>
<a id='line_8151'>  Was in its birth, sustained as might befal</a>
<a id='line_8152'>  By nourishment that came unsought; for still</a>
<a id='line_8153'>  From week to week, from month to month, we lived</a>
<a id='line_8154'>  A round of tumult. Duly were our games</a>
<a id='line_8155'>  Prolonged in summer till the day-light failed:                      10</a>
<a id='line_8156'>  No chair remained before the doors; the bench</a>
<a id='line_8157'>  And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep</a>
<a id='line_8158'>  The labourer, and the old man who had sate</a>
<a id='line_8159'>  A later lingerer; yet the revelry</a>
<a id='line_8160'>  Continued and the loud uproar: at last,                             15</a>
<a id='line_8161'>  When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars</a>
<a id='line_8162'>  Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,</a>
<a id='line_8163'>  Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.</a>
<a id='line_8164'>  Ah! is there one who ever has been young,</a>
<a id='line_8165'>  Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride                         20</a>
<a id='line_8166'>  Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?</a>
<a id='line_8167'>  One is there, though the wisest and the best</a>
<a id='line_8168'>  Of all mankind, who covets not at times</a>
<a id='line_8169'>  Union that cannot be;--who would not give,</a>
<a id='line_8170'>  If so he might, to duty and to truth                                25</a>
<a id='line_8171'>  The eagerness of infantine desire?</a>
<a id='line_8172'>  A tranquillising spirit presses now</a>
<a id='line_8173'>  On my corporeal frame, so wide appears</a>
<a id='line_8174'>  The vacancy between me and those days</a>
<a id='line_8175'>  Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,                       30</a>
<a id='line_8176'>  That, musing on them, often do I seem</a>
<a id='line_8177'>  Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself</a>
<a id='line_8178'>  And of some other Being. A rude mass</a>
<a id='line_8179'>  Of native rock, left midway in the square</a>
<a id='line_8180'>  Of our small market village, was the goal                           35</a>
<a id='line_8181'>  Or centre of these sports; [A] and when, returned</a>
<a id='line_8182'>  After long absence, thither I repaired,</a>
<a id='line_8183'>  Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place</a>
<a id='line_8184'>  A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground</a>
<a id='line_8185'>  That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,                    40</a>
<a id='line_8186'>  And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know</a>
<a id='line_8187'>  That more than one of you will think with me</a>
<a id='line_8188'>  Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame</a>
<a id='line_8189'>  From whom the stone was named, who there had sate,</a>
<a id='line_8190'>  And watched her table with its huckster's wares                     45</a>
<a id='line_8191'>  Assiduous, through the length of sixty years.</a>
<a id='line_8192'></a>
<a id='line_8193'>    We ran a boisterous course; the year span round</a>
<a id='line_8194'>  With giddy motion. But the time approached</a>
<a id='line_8195'>  That brought with it a regular desire</a>
<a id='line_8196'>  For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms                        50</a>
<a id='line_8197'>  Of Nature were collaterally attached</a>
<a id='line_8198'>  To every scheme of holiday delight</a>
<a id='line_8199'>  And every boyish sport, less grateful else</a>
<a id='line_8200'>  And languidly pursued.</a>
<a id='line_8201'>                         When summer came,</a>
<a id='line_8202'>  Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,                           55</a>
<a id='line_8203'>  To sweep, along the plain of Windermere</a>
<a id='line_8204'>  With rival oars; [B] and the selected bourne</a>
<a id='line_8205'>  Was now an Island musical with birds</a>
<a id='line_8206'>  That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle</a>
<a id='line_8207'>  Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown                           60</a>
<a id='line_8208'>  With lilies of the valley like a field; [C]</a>
<a id='line_8209'>  And now a third small Island, where survived</a>
<a id='line_8210'>  In solitude the ruins of a shrine</a>
<a id='line_8211'>  Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served</a>
<a id='line_8212'>  Daily with chaunted rites. [D] In such a race                       65</a>
<a id='line_8213'>  So ended, disappointment could be none,</a>
<a id='line_8214'>  Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:</a>
<a id='line_8215'>  We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,</a>
<a id='line_8216'>  Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,</a>
<a id='line_8217'>  And the vain-glory of superior skill,                               70</a>
<a id='line_8218'>  Were tempered; thus was gradually produced</a>
<a id='line_8219'>  A quiet independence of the heart;</a>
<a id='line_8220'>  And to my Friend who knows me I may add,</a>
<a id='line_8221'>  Fearless of blame, that hence for future days</a>
<a id='line_8222'>  Ensued a diffidence and modesty,                                    75</a>
<a id='line_8223'>  And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,</a>
<a id='line_8224'>  The self-sufficing power of Solitude.</a>
<a id='line_8225'></a>
<a id='line_8226'>    Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!</a>
<a id='line_8227'>  More than we wished we knew the blessing then</a>
<a id='line_8228'>  Of vigorous hunger--hence corporeal strength                        80</a>
<a id='line_8229'>  Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude</a>
<a id='line_8230'>  A little weekly stipend, and we lived</a>
<a id='line_8231'>  Through three divisions of the quartered year</a>
<a id='line_8232'>  In penniless poverty. But now to school</a>
<a id='line_8233'>  From the half-yearly holidays returned,                             85</a>
<a id='line_8234'>  We came with weightier purses, that sufficed</a>
<a id='line_8235'>  To furnish treats more costly than the Dame</a>
<a id='line_8236'>  Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.</a>
<a id='line_8237'>  Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,</a>
<a id='line_8238'>  Or in the woods, or by a river side                                 90</a>
<a id='line_8239'>  Or shady fountains, while among the leaves</a>
<a id='line_8240'>  Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun</a>
<a id='line_8241'>  Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.</a>
<a id='line_8242'>  Nor is my aim neglected if I tell</a>
<a id='line_8243'>  How sometimes, in the length of those half-years,                   95</a>
<a id='line_8244'>  We from our funds drew largely;--proud to curb,</a>
<a id='line_8245'>  And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;</a>
<a id='line_8246'>  And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud</a>
<a id='line_8247'>  Supplied our want, we haply might employ</a>
<a id='line_8248'>  Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound                           100</a>
<a id='line_8249'>  Were distant: some famed temple where of yore</a>
<a id='line_8250'>  The Druids worshipped, [E] or the antique walls</a>
<a id='line_8251'>  Of that large abbey, where within the Vale</a>
<a id='line_8252'>  Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built, [F]</a>
<a id='line_8253'>  Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,                  105</a>
<a id='line_8254'>  Belfry, [G] and images, and living trees,</a>
<a id='line_8255'>  A holy scene! Along the smooth green turf</a>
<a id='line_8256'>  Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace</a>
<a id='line_8257'>  Left by the west wind sweeping overhead</a>
<a id='line_8258'>  From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers                          110</a>
<a id='line_8259'>  In that sequestered valley may be seen,</a>
<a id='line_8260'>  Both silent and both motionless alike;</a>
<a id='line_8261'>  Such the deep shelter that is there, and such</a>
<a id='line_8262'>  The safeguard for repose and quietness.</a>
<a id='line_8263'></a>
<a id='line_8264'>    Our steeds remounted and the summons given,                      115</a>
<a id='line_8265'>  With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew</a>
<a id='line_8266'>  In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,</a>
<a id='line_8267'>  And the stone-abbot, [H] and that single wren</a>
<a id='line_8268'>  Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave</a>
<a id='line_8269'>  Of the old church, that--though from recent showers                120</a>
<a id='line_8270'>  The earth was comfortless, and touched by faint</a>
<a id='line_8271'>  Internal breezes, sobbings of the place</a>
<a id='line_8272'>  And respirations, from the roofless walls</a>
<a id='line_8273'>  The shuddering ivy dripped large drops--yet still</a>
<a id='line_8274'>  So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird                       125</a>
<a id='line_8275'>  Sang to herself, that there I could have made</a>
<a id='line_8276'>  My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there</a>
<a id='line_8277'>  To hear such music. Through the walls we flew</a>
<a id='line_8278'>  And down the valley, and, a circuit made</a>
<a id='line_8279'>  In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth                   130</a>
<a id='line_8280'>  We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,</a>
<a id='line_8281'>  And that still spirit shed from evening air!</a>
<a id='line_8282'>  Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt</a>
<a id='line_8283'>  Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed</a>
<a id='line_8284'>  Along the sides of the steep hills, or when                        135</a>
<a id='line_8285'>  Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea</a>
<a id='line_8286'>  We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.</a>
<a id='line_8287'></a>
<a id='line_8288'>    Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,</a>
<a id='line_8289'>  Within the crescent of a pleasant bay, [I]</a>
<a id='line_8290'>  A tavern stood; [K] no homely-featured house,                      140</a>
<a id='line_8291'>  Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,</a>
<a id='line_8292'>  But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset</a>
<a id='line_8293'>  With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within</a>
<a id='line_8294'>  Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.</a>
<a id='line_8295'>  In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built                       145</a>
<a id='line_8296'>  On the large island, had this dwelling been</a>
<a id='line_8297'>  More worthy of a poet's love, a hut,</a>
<a id='line_8298'>  Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.</a>
<a id='line_8299'>  But--though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed</a>
<a id='line_8300'>  The threshold, and large golden characters,                        150</a>
<a id='line_8301'>  Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged</a>
<a id='line_8302'>  The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight</a>
<a id='line_8303'>  And mockery of the rustic painter's hand--[L]</a>
<a id='line_8304'>  Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear</a>
<a id='line_8305'>  With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay                          155</a>
<a id='line_8306'>  Upon a slope surmounted by a plain</a>
<a id='line_8307'>  Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood</a>
<a id='line_8308'>  A grove, with gleams of water through the trees</a>
<a id='line_8309'>  And over the tree-tops; [M] nor did we want</a>
<a id='line_8310'>  Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.                        160</a>
<a id='line_8311'>  There, while through half an afternoon we played</a>
<a id='line_8312'>  On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed</a>
<a id='line_8313'>  Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee</a>
<a id='line_8314'>  Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,</a>
<a id='line_8315'>  When in our pinnace we returned at leisure                         165</a>
<a id='line_8316'>  Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach</a>
<a id='line_8317'>  Of some small island steered our course with one,</a>
<a id='line_8318'>  The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there, [N]</a>
<a id='line_8319'>  And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute</a>
<a id='line_8320'>  Alone upon the rock--oh, then, the calm                            170</a>
<a id='line_8321'>  And dead still water lay upon my mind</a>
<a id='line_8322'>  Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8323'>  Never before so beautiful, sank down</a>
<a id='line_8324'>  Into my heart, and held me like a dream!</a>
<a id='line_8325'>  Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus                         175</a>
<a id='line_8326'>  Daily the common range of visible things</a>
<a id='line_8327'>  Grew dear to me: already I began</a>
<a id='line_8328'>  To love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,</a>
<a id='line_8329'>  Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge</a>
<a id='line_8330'>  And surety of our earthly life, a light                            180</a>
<a id='line_8331'>  Which we behold and feel we are alive; [O]</a>
<a id='line_8332'>  Nor for his bounty to so many worlds--</a>
<a id='line_8333'>  But for this cause, that I had seen him lay</a>
<a id='line_8334'>  His beauty on the morning hills, had seen</a>
<a id='line_8335'>  The western mountain [P] touch his setting orb,                    185</a>
<a id='line_8336'>  In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess</a>
<a id='line_8337'>  Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow</a>
<a id='line_8338'>  For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.</a>
<a id='line_8339'>  And, from like feelings, humble though intense,</a>
<a id='line_8340'>  To patriotic and domestic love                                     190</a>
<a id='line_8341'>  Analogous, the moon to me was dear;</a>
<a id='line_8342'>  For I could dream away my purposes,</a>
<a id='line_8343'>  Standing to gaze upon her while she hung</a>
<a id='line_8344'>  Midway between the hills, as if she knew</a>
<a id='line_8345'>  No other region, but belonged to thee, [Q]                         195</a>
<a id='line_8346'>  Yea, appertained by a peculiar right</a>
<a id='line_8347'>  To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale! [R]</a>
<a id='line_8348'></a>
<a id='line_8349'>    Those incidental charms which first attached</a>

<a id='line_8352'>  How Nature, intervenient till this time</a>

<a id='line_8363'>  Science appears but what in truth she is,</a>
<a id='line_8364'>  Not as our glory and our absolute boast,</a>
<a id='line_8365'>  But as a succedaneum, and a prop</a>
<a id='line_8366'>  To our infirmity. No officious slave                               215</a>
<a id='line_8367'>  Art thou of that false secondary power</a>

<a id='line_8390'>  For him, in one dear Presence, there exists</a>
<a id='line_8391'>  A virtue which irradiates and exalts</a>
<a id='line_8392'>  Objects through widest intercourse of sense.                       240</a>
<a id='line_8393'>  No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:</a>
<a id='line_8394'>  Along his infant veins are interfused</a>
<a id='line_8395'>  The gravitation and the filial bond</a>

<a id='line_8397'>  Is there a flower, to which he points with hand                    245</a>
<a id='line_8398'>  Too weak to gather it, already love</a>
<a id='line_8399'>  Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him</a>
<a id='line_8400'>  Hath beautified that flower; already shades</a>
<a id='line_8401'>  Of pity cast from inward tenderness</a>
<a id='line_8402'>  Do fall around him upon aught that bears                           250</a>
<a id='line_8403'>  Unsightly marks of violence or harm.</a>
<a id='line_8404'>  Emphatically such a Being lives,</a>
<a id='line_8405'>  Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,</a>
<a id='line_8406'>  An inmate of this active universe.</a>
<a id='line_8407'>  For feeling has to him imparted power                              255</a>
<a id='line_8408'>  That through the growing faculties of sense</a>
<a id='line_8409'>  Doth like an agent of the one great Mind</a>

<a id='line_8413'>  Poetic spirit of our human life,</a>
<a id='line_8414'>  By uniform control of after years,</a>

<a id='line_8416'>  Through every change of growth and of decay,</a>
<a id='line_8417'>  Pre-eminent till death.</a>
<a id='line_8418'></a>
<a id='line_8419'>                         From early days,                            265</a>
<a id='line_8420'>  Beginning not long after that first time</a>
<a id='line_8421'>  In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch</a>
<a id='line_8422'>  I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,</a>
<a id='line_8423'>  I have endeavoured to display the means</a>
<a id='line_8424'>  Whereby this infant sensibility,                                   270</a>
<a id='line_8425'>  Great birthright of our being, was in me</a>
<a id='line_8426'>  Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path</a>
<a id='line_8427'>  More difficult before me; and I fear</a>
<a id='line_8428'>  That in its broken windings we shall need</a>
<a id='line_8429'>  The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:                         275</a>
<a id='line_8430'>  For now a trouble came into my mind</a>
<a id='line_8431'>  From unknown causes. I was left alone</a>
<a id='line_8432'>  Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.</a>
<a id='line_8433'>  The props of my affections were removed,</a>
<a id='line_8434'>  And yet the building stood, as if sustained                        280</a>
<a id='line_8435'>  By its own spirit! All that I beheld</a>
<a id='line_8436'>  Was dear, and hence to finer influxes</a>
<a id='line_8437'>  The mind lay open to a more exact</a>
<a id='line_8438'>  And close communion. Many are our joys</a>
<a id='line_8439'>  In youth, but oh! what happiness to live                           285</a>
<a id='line_8440'>  When every hour brings palpable access</a>
<a id='line_8441'>  Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,</a>
<a id='line_8442'>  And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,</a>
<a id='line_8443'>  And every season wheresoe'er I moved</a>
<a id='line_8444'>  Unfolded transitory qualities,                                     290</a>
<a id='line_8445'>  Which, but for this most watchful power of love,</a>
<a id='line_8446'>  Had been neglected; left a register</a>
<a id='line_8447'>  Of permanent relations, else unknown.</a>
<a id='line_8448'>  Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude</a>
<a id='line_8449'>  More active even than "best society"--[T]                          295</a>
<a id='line_8450'>  Society made sweet as solitude</a>
<a id='line_8451'>  By silent inobtrusive sympathies--</a>
<a id='line_8452'>  And gentle agitations of the mind</a>
<a id='line_8453'>  From manifold distinctions, difference</a>
<a id='line_8454'>  Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,                 300</a>
<a id='line_8455'>  No difference is, and hence, from the same source,</a>
<a id='line_8456'>  Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,</a>
<a id='line_8457'>  Under the quiet stars, and at that time</a>
<a id='line_8458'>  Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound</a>
<a id='line_8459'>  To breathe an elevated mood, by form                               305</a>
<a id='line_8460'>  Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,</a>
<a id='line_8461'>  If the night blackened with a coming storm,</a>
<a id='line_8462'>  Beneath some rock, listening to notes that are</a>
<a id='line_8463'>  The ghostly language of the ancient earth,</a>
<a id='line_8464'>  Or make their dim abode in distant winds.                          310</a>
<a id='line_8465'>  Thence did I drink the visionary power;</a>
<a id='line_8466'>  And deem not profitless those fleeting moods</a>
<a id='line_8467'>  Of shadowy exultation: not for this,</a>
<a id='line_8468'>  That they are kindred to our purer mind</a>
<a id='line_8469'>  And intellectual life; but that the soul,                          315</a>
<a id='line_8470'>  Remembering how she felt, but what she felt</a>
<a id='line_8471'>  Remembering not, retains an obscure sense</a>
<a id='line_8472'>  Of possible sublimity, whereto</a>
<a id='line_8473'>  With growing faculties she doth aspire,</a>
<a id='line_8474'>  With faculties still growing, feeling still                        320</a>
<a id='line_8475'>  That whatsoever point they gain, they yet</a>
<a id='line_8476'>  Have something to pursue.</a>
<a id='line_8477'></a>
<a id='line_8478'>                                  And not alone,</a>
<a id='line_8479'>  'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair</a>
<a id='line_8480'>  And tranquil scenes, that universal power</a>
<a id='line_8481'>  And fitness in the latent qualities                                325</a>
<a id='line_8482'>  And essences of things, by which the mind</a>
<a id='line_8483'>  Is moved with feelings of delight, to me</a>
<a id='line_8484'>  Came, strengthened with a superadded soul,</a>
<a id='line_8485'>  A virtue not its own. My morning walks</a>
<a id='line_8486'>  Were early;--oft before the hours of school [U]                    330</a>
<a id='line_8487'>  I travelled round our little lake, [V] five miles</a>
<a id='line_8488'>  Of pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dear</a>
<a id='line_8489'>  For this, that one was by my side, a Friend, [W]</a>
<a id='line_8490'>  Then passionately loved; with heart how full</a>
<a id='line_8491'>  Would he peruse these lines! For many years                        335</a>
<a id='line_8492'>  Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds</a>
<a id='line_8493'>  Both silent to each other, at this time</a>
<a id='line_8494'>  We live as if those hours had never been.</a>
<a id='line_8495'>  Nor seldom did I lift--our cottage latch [X]</a>
<a id='line_8496'>  Far earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen                        340</a>
<a id='line_8497'>  From human dwelling, or the vernal thrush</a>
<a id='line_8498'>  Was audible; and sate among the woods</a>
<a id='line_8499'>  Alone upon some jutting eminence, [Y]</a>
<a id='line_8500'>  At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,</a>
<a id='line_8501'>  Yet slumbering, lay in utter solitude.                             345</a>
<a id='line_8502'>  How shall I seek the origin? where find</a>
<a id='line_8503'>  Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt?</a>
<a id='line_8504'>  Oft in these moments such a holy calm</a>
<a id='line_8505'>  Would overspread my soul, that bodily eyes</a>
<a id='line_8506'>  Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw                             350</a>
<a id='line_8507'>  Appeared like something in myself, a dream,</a>
<a id='line_8508'>  A prospect in the mind. [Z]</a>
<a id='line_8509'>                    'Twere long to tell</a>
<a id='line_8510'>  What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,</a>
<a id='line_8511'>  And what the summer shade, what day and night,</a>
<a id='line_8512'>  Evening and morning, sleep and waking, thought                     355</a>
<a id='line_8513'>  From sources inexhaustible, poured forth</a>
<a id='line_8514'>  To feed the spirit of religious love</a>
<a id='line_8515'>  In which I walked with Nature. But let this</a>
<a id='line_8516'>  Be not forgotten, that I still retained</a>
<a id='line_8517'>  My first creative sensibility;                                     360</a>
<a id='line_8518'>  That by the regular action of the world</a>
<a id='line_8519'>  My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power</a>
<a id='line_8520'>  Abode with me; a forming hand, at times</a>
<a id='line_8521'>  Rebellious, acting in a devious mood;</a>
<a id='line_8522'>  A local spirit of his own, at war                                  365</a>
<a id='line_8523'>  With general tendency, but, for the most,</a>
<a id='line_8524'>  Subservient strictly to external things</a>
<a id='line_8525'>  With which it communed. An auxiliar light</a>
<a id='line_8526'>  Came from my mind, which on the setting sun</a>
<a id='line_8527'>  Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,                       370</a>
<a id='line_8528'>  The fluttering breezes, fountains that run on</a>
<a id='line_8529'>  Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed</a>
<a id='line_8530'>  A like dominion, and the midnight storm</a>
<a id='line_8531'>  Grew darker in the presence of my eye:</a>
<a id='line_8532'>  Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence,                             375</a>
<a id='line_8533'>  And hence my transport.</a>
<a id='line_8534'>           Nor should this, perchance,</a>
<a id='line_8535'>  Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved</a>
<a id='line_8536'>  The exercise and produce of a toil,</a>
<a id='line_8537'>  Than analytic industry to me</a>
<a id='line_8538'>  More pleasing, and whose character I deem                          380</a>
<a id='line_8539'>  Is more poetic as resembling more</a>
<a id='line_8540'>  Creative agency. The song would speak</a>
<a id='line_8541'>  Of that interminable building reared</a>
<a id='line_8542'>  By observation of affinities</a>
<a id='line_8543'>  In objects where no brotherhood exists                             385</a>
<a id='line_8544'>  To passive minds. My seventeenth year was come;</a>
<a id='line_8545'>  And, whether from this habit rooted now</a>
<a id='line_8546'>  So deeply in my mind; or from excess</a>
<a id='line_8547'>  In the great social principle of life</a>
<a id='line_8548'>  Coercing all things into sympathy,                                 390</a>
<a id='line_8549'>  To unorganic ratures were transferred</a>
<a id='line_8550'>  My own enjoyments; or the power of truth</a>

<a id='line_8553'>  Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.                         395</a>
<a id='line_8554'>  Thus while the days flew by, and years passed on,</a>
<a id='line_8555'>  From Nature and her overflowing soul,</a>
<a id='line_8556'>  I had received so much, that all my thoughts</a>
<a id='line_8557'>  Were steeped in feeling; I was only then</a>
<a id='line_8558'>  Contented, when with bliss ineffable                               400</a>
<a id='line_8559'>  I felt the sentiment of Being spread</a>
<a id='line_8560'>  O'er all that moves and all that seemeth still;</a>
<a id='line_8561'>  O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought</a>
<a id='line_8562'>  And human knowledge, to the human eye</a>
<a id='line_8563'>  Invisible, yet liveth to the heart;                                405</a>
<a id='line_8564'>  O'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,</a>
<a id='line_8565'>  Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides</a>
<a id='line_8566'>  Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself,</a>
<a id='line_8567'>  And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not</a>
<a id='line_8568'>  If high the transport, great the joy I felt,                       410</a>
<a id='line_8569'>  Communing in this sort through earth and heaven</a>
<a id='line_8570'>  With every form of creature, as it looked</a>
<a id='line_8571'>  Towards the Uncreated with a countenance</a>
<a id='line_8572'>  Of adoration, with an eye of love.</a>
<a id='line_8573'>  One song they sang, and it was audible,                            415</a>
<a id='line_8574'>  Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear,</a>
<a id='line_8575'>  O'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain,</a>
<a id='line_8576'>  Forgot her functions, and slept undisturbed.</a>

<a id='line_8918'>  My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,</a>
<a id='line_8919'>  And as I paced alone the level fields</a>
<a id='line_8920'>  Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime</a>
<a id='line_8921'>  With which I had been conversant, the mind                          95</a>

<a id='line_8923'>  With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.</a>

<a id='line_8927'>  What independent solaces were mine,</a>
<a id='line_8928'>  To mitigate the injurious sway of place</a>
<a id='line_8929'>  Or circumstance, how far soever changed</a>
<a id='line_8930'>  In youth, or to be changed in manhood's prime;</a>

<a id='line_8937'>  Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace</a>
<a id='line_8938'>  Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;</a>
<a id='line_8939'>  And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed</a>
<a id='line_8940'>  By the proud name she bears--the name of Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_8941'>  I called on both to teach me what they might;                      115</a>

<a id='line_8943'>  Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts</a>

<a id='line_8945'>  Incumbencies more awful, visitings</a>
<a id='line_8946'>  Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,                              120</a>
<a id='line_8947'>  That tolerates the indignities of Time,</a>
<a id='line_8948'>  And, from the centre of Eternity</a>
<a id='line_8949'>  All finite motions overruling, lives</a>
<a id='line_8950'>  In glory immutable. But peace! enough</a>
<a id='line_8951'>  Here to record that I was mounting now                             125</a>
<a id='line_8952'>  To such community with highest truth--</a>
<a id='line_8953'>  A track pursuing, not untrod before,</a>

<a id='line_8956'>  To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,                      130</a>
<a id='line_8957'>  Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,</a>

<a id='line_8965'>  I was as sensitive as waters are</a>

<a id='line_8967'>  Of passion; was obedient as a lute</a>
<a id='line_8968'>  That waits upon the touches of the wind.</a>
<a id='line_8969'>  Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich--</a>
<a id='line_8970'>  I had a world about me--'twas my own;</a>
<a id='line_8971'>  I made it, for it only lived to me,                                145</a>
<a id='line_8972'>  And to the God who sees into the heart.</a>
<a id='line_8973'>  Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed</a>
<a id='line_8974'>  By outward gestures and by visible looks:</a>
<a id='line_8975'>  Some called it madness--so indeed it was,</a>
<a id='line_8976'>  If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,                         150</a>

<a id='line_8984'>  It was no madness, for the bodily eye</a>
<a id='line_8985'>  Amid my strongest workings evermore</a>
<a id='line_8986'>  Was searching out the lines of difference                          160</a>
<a id='line_8987'>  As they lie hid in all external forms,</a>
<a id='line_8988'>  Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye</a>

<a id='line_8990'>  To the broad ocean and the azure heavens</a>
<a id='line_8991'>  Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,                         165</a>
<a id='line_8992'>  Could find no surface where its power might sleep;</a>
<a id='line_8993'>  Which spake perpetual logic to my soul,</a>
<a id='line_8994'>  And by an unrelenting agency</a>
<a id='line_8995'>  Did bind my feelings even as in a chain.</a>
<a id='line_8996'></a>
<a id='line_8997'>    And here, O Friend! have I retraced my life                      170</a>
<a id='line_8998'>  Up to an eminence, and told a tale</a>
<a id='line_8999'>  Of matters which not falsely may be called</a>
<a id='line_9000'>  The glory of my youth. Of genius, power,</a>
<a id='line_9001'>  Creation and divinity itself</a>
<a id='line_9002'>  I have been speaking, for my theme has been                        175</a>
<a id='line_9003'>  What passed within me. Not of outward things</a>
<a id='line_9004'>  Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,</a>
<a id='line_9005'>  Symbols or actions, but of my own heart</a>
<a id='line_9006'>  Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind.</a>
<a id='line_9007'>  O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,                        180</a>
<a id='line_9008'>  And what they do within themselves while yet</a>
<a id='line_9009'>  The yoke of earth is new to them, the world</a>
<a id='line_9010'>  Nothing but a wild field where they were sown.</a>
<a id='line_9011'>  This is, in truth, heroic argument,</a>
<a id='line_9012'>  This genuine prowess, which I wished to touch                      185</a>
<a id='line_9013'>  With hand however weak, but in the main</a>
<a id='line_9014'>  It lies far hidden from the reach of words.</a>
<a id='line_9015'>  Points have we all of us within our souls</a>
<a id='line_9016'>  Where all stand single; this I feel, and make</a>
<a id='line_9017'>  Breathings for incommunicable powers;                              190</a>
<a id='line_9018'>  But is not each a memory to himself?</a>
<a id='line_9019'>  And, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,</a>
<a id='line_9020'>  I am not heartless, for there's not a man</a>
<a id='line_9021'>  That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,</a>
<a id='line_9022'>  And feels not what an empire we inherit                            195</a>
<a id='line_9023'>  As natural beings in the strength of Nature.</a>
<a id='line_9024'></a>
<a id='line_9025'>    No more: for now into a populous plain</a>
<a id='line_9026'>  We must descend. A Traveller I am,</a>
<a id='line_9027'>  Whose tale is only of himself; even so,</a>
<a id='line_9028'>  So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt                           200</a>
<a id='line_9029'>  To follow, and if thou, my honoured Friend!</a>
<a id='line_9030'>  Who in these thoughts art ever at my side,</a>
<a id='line_9031'>  Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps.</a>
<a id='line_9032'></a>
<a id='line_9033'>    It hath been told, that when the first delight</a>
<a id='line_9034'>  That flashed upon me from this novel show                          205</a>
<a id='line_9035'>  Had failed, the mind returned into herself;</a>
<a id='line_9036'>  Yet true it is, that I had made a change</a>
<a id='line_9037'>  In climate, and my nature's outward coat</a>
<a id='line_9038'>  Changed also slowly and insensibly.</a>
<a id='line_9039'>  Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts                            210</a>
<a id='line_9040'>  Of loneliness gave way to empty noise</a>
<a id='line_9041'>  And superficial pastimes; now and then</a>
<a id='line_9042'>  Forced labour, and more frequently forced hopes;</a>
<a id='line_9043'>  And, worst of all, a treasonable growth</a>
<a id='line_9044'>  Of indecisive judgments, that impaired                             215</a>
<a id='line_9045'>  And shook the mind's simplicity.--And yet</a>
<a id='line_9046'>  This was a gladsome time. Could I behold--</a>
<a id='line_9047'>  Who, less insensible than sodden clay</a>
<a id='line_9048'>  In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,</a>
<a id='line_9049'>  Could have beheld,--with undelighted heart,                        220</a>
<a id='line_9050'>  So many happy youths, so wide and fair</a>
<a id='line_9051'>  A congregation in its budding-time</a>
<a id='line_9052'>  Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once</a>
<a id='line_9053'>  So many divers samples from the growth</a>
<a id='line_9054'>  Of life's sweet season--could have seen unmoved                    225</a>
<a id='line_9055'>  That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers</a>
<a id='line_9056'>  Decking the matron temples of a place</a>
<a id='line_9057'>  So famous through the world? To me, at least,</a>
<a id='line_9058'>  It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,</a>
<a id='line_9059'>  Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped,                    230</a>
<a id='line_9060'>  And independent musings pleased me so</a>
<a id='line_9061'>  That spells seemed on me when I was alone,</a>
<a id='line_9062'>  Yet could I only cleave to solitude</a>
<a id='line_9063'>  In lonely places; if a throng was near</a>
<a id='line_9064'>  That way I leaned by nature; for my heart                          235</a>
<a id='line_9065'>  Was social, and loved idleness and joy.</a>
<a id='line_9066'></a>
<a id='line_9067'>    Not seeking those who might participate</a>
<a id='line_9068'>  My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,</a>
<a id='line_9069'>  Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs,</a>
<a id='line_9070'>  Even with myself divided such delight,                             240</a>
<a id='line_9071'>  Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed</a>
<a id='line_9072'>  In human language), easily I passed</a>
<a id='line_9073'>  From the remembrances of better things,</a>
<a id='line_9074'>  And slipped into the ordinary works</a>
<a id='line_9075'>  Of careless youth, unburthened, unalarmed.                         245</a>
<a id='line_9076'>  _Caverns_ there were within my mind which sun</a>
<a id='line_9077'>  Could never penetrate, yet did there not</a>
<a id='line_9078'>  Want store of leafy _arbours_ where the light</a>
<a id='line_9079'>  Might enter in at will. Companionships,</a>
<a id='line_9080'>  Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome all.                      250</a>
<a id='line_9081'>  We sauntered, played, or rioted; we talked</a>
<a id='line_9082'>  Unprofitable talk at morning hours;</a>
<a id='line_9083'>  Drifted about along the streets and walks,</a>
<a id='line_9084'>  Read lazily in trivial books, went forth</a>
<a id='line_9085'>  To gallop through the country in blind zeal                        255</a>
<a id='line_9086'>  Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast</a>
<a id='line_9087'>  Of Cam sailed boisterously, and let the stars</a>
<a id='line_9088'>  Come forth, perhaps without one quiet thought.</a>
<a id='line_9089'></a>
<a id='line_9090'>    Such was the tenor of the second act</a>
<a id='line_9091'>  In this new life. Imagination slept,                               260</a>
<a id='line_9092'>  And yet not utterly. I could not print</a>
<a id='line_9093'>  Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps</a>
<a id='line_9094'>  Of generations of illustrious men,</a>
<a id='line_9095'>  Unmoved. I could not always lightly pass</a>
<a id='line_9096'>  Through the same gateways, sleep where they had slept,             265</a>
<a id='line_9097'>  Wake where they waked, range that inclosure old,</a>
<a id='line_9098'>  That garden of great intellects, undisturbed.</a>
<a id='line_9099'>  Place also by the side of this dark sense</a>
<a id='line_9100'>  Of noble feeling, that those spiritual men,</a>
<a id='line_9101'>  Even the great Newton's own ethereal self,                         270</a>
<a id='line_9102'>  Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be</a>
<a id='line_9103'>  The more endeared. Their several memories here</a>
<a id='line_9104'>  (Even like their persons in their portraits clothed</a>
<a id='line_9105'>  With the accustomed garb of daily life)</a>
<a id='line_9106'>  Put on a lowly and a touching grace                                275</a>
<a id='line_9107'>  Of more distinct humanity, that left</a>
<a id='line_9108'>  All genuine admiration unimpaired.</a>
<a id='line_9109'></a>
<a id='line_9110'>    Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington [D]</a>
<a id='line_9111'>  I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade;</a>
<a id='line_9112'>  Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales               280</a>
<a id='line_9113'>  Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard,</a>
<a id='line_9114'>  Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State--</a>
<a id='line_9115'>  Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven</a>
<a id='line_9116'>  With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,</a>
<a id='line_9117'>  I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!                      285</a>
<a id='line_9118'>  Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day,</a>
<a id='line_9119'>  Stood almost single; uttering odious truth--</a>
<a id='line_9120'>  Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,</a>
<a id='line_9121'>  Soul awful--if the earth has ever lodged</a>
<a id='line_9122'>  An awful soul--I seemed to see him here                            290</a>
<a id='line_9123'>  Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress</a>
<a id='line_9124'>  Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth--</a>
<a id='line_9125'>  A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks</a>
<a id='line_9126'>  Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,</a>
<a id='line_9127'>  And conscious step of purity and pride.                            295</a>
<a id='line_9128'>  Among the band of my compeers was one</a>
<a id='line_9129'>  Whom chance had stationed in the very room</a>

<a id='line_9131'>  Be it confest that, for the first time, seated</a>

<a id='line_9133'>  One of a festive circle, I poured out</a>
<a id='line_9134'>  Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride</a>
<a id='line_9135'>  And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain</a>
<a id='line_9136'>  Never excited by the fumes of wine</a>
<a id='line_9137'>  Before that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran                      305</a>
<a id='line_9138'>  From the assembly; through a length of streets,</a>
<a id='line_9139'>  Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door</a>
<a id='line_9140'>  In not a desperate or opprobrious time,</a>
<a id='line_9141'>  Albeit long after the importunate bell</a>
<a id='line_9142'>  Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice                        310</a>
<a id='line_9143'>  No longer haunting the dark winter night.</a>
<a id='line_9144'>  Call back, O Friend! [E] a moment to thy mind,</a>

<a id='line_9149'>  On the last skirts of their permitted ground,</a>
<a id='line_9150'>  Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts!</a>
<a id='line_9151'>  I am ashamed of them: and that great Bard,</a>

<a id='line_9174'>  Of those long vistas, sacred catacombs,</a>

<a id='line_9177'>  A fervent love of rigorous discipline.--</a>
<a id='line_9178'>  Alas! such high emotion touched not me.                            345</a>

<a id='line_9200'>  Not that I slighted books, [H]--that were to lack</a>

<a id='line_9333'></a>
<a id='line_9334'>                           I did not love,</a>

<a id='line_9340'>  Who in the field of contest persevered,</a>

<a id='line_9347'>  The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps,</a>

<a id='line_9349'>  With our own inner being are forgot.</a>
<a id='line_9350'></a>
<a id='line_9351'>    Yet was this deep vacation not given up</a>

<a id='line_9353'>  In my own mind remote from social life,</a>
<a id='line_9354'>  (At least from what we commonly so name,)                          515</a>
<a id='line_9355'>  Like a lone shepherd on a promontory</a>
<a id='line_9356'>  Who lacking occupation looks far forth</a>
<a id='line_9357'>  Into the boundless sea, and rather makes</a>
<a id='line_9358'>  Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,</a>
<a id='line_9359'>  That this first transit from the smooth delights                   520</a>

<a id='line_9365'>  Did better suit my visionary mind,</a>

<a id='line_9373'>  In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,</a>
<a id='line_9374'>  With playful zest of fancy did we note                             535</a>
<a id='line_9375'>  (How could we less?) the manners and the ways</a>

<a id='line_9381'>  To set our minds on edge, and did no more.</a>
<a id='line_9382'>  Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,</a>
<a id='line_9383'>  Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring</a>
<a id='line_9384'>  Of the grave Elders, men unsecured, grotesque                      545</a>
<a id='line_9385'>  In character, tricked out like aged trees</a>
<a id='line_9386'>  Which through the lapse of their infirmity</a>

<a id='line_9390'>    Here on my view, confronting vividly                             550</a>
<a id='line_9391'>  Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left,</a>
<a id='line_9392'>  Appeared a different aspect of old age;</a>

<a id='line_9395'>  Or portraitures for special use designed,                          555</a>
<a id='line_9396'>  As some might seem, so aptly do they serve</a>
<a id='line_9397'>  To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments--</a>
<a id='line_9398'>  That book upheld as with maternal care</a>
<a id='line_9399'>  When she would enter on her tender scheme</a>
<a id='line_9400'>  Of teaching comprehension with delight,                            560</a>
<a id='line_9401'>  And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_9402'></a>
<a id='line_9403'>    The surfaces of artificial life</a>
<a id='line_9404'>  And manners finely wrought, the delicate race</a>
<a id='line_9405'>  Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down</a>
<a id='line_9406'>  Through that state arras woven with silk and gold;                 565</a>
<a id='line_9407'>  This wily interchange of snaky hues,</a>
<a id='line_9408'>  Willingly or unwillingly revealed,</a>
<a id='line_9409'>  I neither knew nor cared for; and as such</a>
<a id='line_9410'>  Were wanting here, I took what might be found</a>
<a id='line_9411'>  Of less elaborate fabric. At this day                              570</a>
<a id='line_9412'>  I smile, in many a mountain solitude</a>
<a id='line_9413'>  Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks</a>
<a id='line_9414'>  Of character, in points of wit as broad,</a>
<a id='line_9415'>  As aught by wooden images performed</a>
<a id='line_9416'>  For entertainment of the gaping crowd                              575</a>
<a id='line_9417'>  At wake or fair. And oftentimes do flit</a>
<a id='line_9418'>  Remembrances before me of old men--</a>
<a id='line_9419'>  Old humourists, who have been long in their graves,</a>
<a id='line_9420'>  And having almost in my mind put off</a>
<a id='line_9421'>  Their human names, have into phantoms passed                       580</a>
<a id='line_9422'>  Of texture midway between life and books.</a>
<a id='line_9423'></a>
<a id='line_9424'>    I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note</a>

<a id='line_9431'>  An artless rustic's notice, this way less,</a>

<a id='line_9528'>illustrates the above and other passages of this book. It was written</a>
<a id='line_9529'>from Forncett, on the 26th of June, 1791. She is speaking of her two</a>
<a id='line_9530'>brothers, William and Christopher. Of Christopher she says:</a>
<a id='line_9531'></a>
<a id='line_9532'>  "His abilities, though not so great, perhaps, as his brother's, may be</a>
<a id='line_9533'>  of more use to him, as he has not fixed his mind upon any particular</a>
<a id='line_9534'>  species of reading or conceived an aversion to any. He is not fond of</a>
<a id='line_9535'>  mathematics, but has resolution sufficient to study them; because it</a>
<a id='line_9536'>  will be impossible for him to obtain a fellowship without them.</a>
<a id='line_9537'>  William lost the chance, indeed the certainty, of a fellowship, by not</a>
<a id='line_9538'>  combating his inclinations. He gave way to his natural dislike to</a>
<a id='line_9539'>  studies so dry as many parts of the mathematics, consequently could</a>
<a id='line_9540'>  not succeed in Cambridge. He reads Italian, Spanish, French, Greek,</a>
<a id='line_9541'>  Latin, and English; but never opens a mathematical book.... Do not</a>
<a id='line_9542'>  think from what I have said that he reads not at all; for he does read</a>
<a id='line_9543'>  a great deal, and not only poetry, in these languages he is acquainted</a>
<a id='line_9544'>  with, but History also," etc. etc.</a>

<a id='line_9568'></a>
<a id='line_9569'></a>
<a id='line_9570'>  Bright was the summer's noon when quickening steps</a>
<a id='line_9571'>  Followed each other till a dreary moor</a>
<a id='line_9572'>  Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top [A]</a>
<a id='line_9573'>  Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,</a>
<a id='line_9574'>  I overlooked the bed of Windermere,                                  5</a>
<a id='line_9575'>  Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_9576'>  With exultation, at my feet I saw</a>
<a id='line_9577'>  Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,</a>
<a id='line_9578'>  A universe of Nature's fairest forms</a>
<a id='line_9579'>  Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,                          10</a>
<a id='line_9580'>  Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.</a>
<a id='line_9581'>  I bounded down the hill shouting amain</a>
<a id='line_9582'>  For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks</a>
<a id='line_9583'>  Replied, and when the Charon of the flood</a>
<a id='line_9584'>  Had staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier, [B]               15</a>
<a id='line_9585'>  I did not step into the well-known boat</a>
<a id='line_9586'>  Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed</a>
<a id='line_9587'>  Up the familiar hill I took my way [C]</a>
<a id='line_9588'>  Towards that sweet Valley [D] where I had been reared;</a>
<a id='line_9589'>  'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round                    20</a>
<a id='line_9590'>  I saw the snow-white church upon her hill [E]</a>
<a id='line_9591'>  Sit like a thronèd Lady, sending out</a>
<a id='line_9592'>  A gracious look all over her domain. [F]</a>
<a id='line_9593'>  Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;</a>
<a id='line_9594'>  With eager footsteps I advance and reach                            25</a>
<a id='line_9595'>  The cottage threshold where my journey closed.</a>
<a id='line_9596'>  Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_9597'>  From my old Dame, so kind and motherly, [G]</a>
<a id='line_9598'>  While she perused me with a parent's pride.</a>
<a id='line_9599'>  The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew                       30</a>
<a id='line_9600'>  Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart</a>
<a id='line_9601'>  Can beat never will I forget thy name.</a>
<a id='line_9602'>  Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest</a>
<a id='line_9603'>  After thy innocent and busy stir</a>
<a id='line_9604'>  In narrow cares, thy little daily growth                            35</a>
<a id='line_9605'>  Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,</a>
<a id='line_9606'>  And more than eighty, of untroubled life, [H]</a>
<a id='line_9607'>  Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood</a>
<a id='line_9608'>  Honoured with little less than filial love.</a>
<a id='line_9609'>  What joy was mine to see thee once again,                           40</a>
<a id='line_9610'>  Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things</a>
<a id='line_9611'>  About its narrow precincts all beloved, [I]</a>
<a id='line_9612'>  And many of them seeming yet my own!</a>
<a id='line_9613'>  Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts</a>
<a id='line_9614'>  Have felt, and every man alive can guess?                           45</a>
<a id='line_9615'>  The rooms, the court, the garden were not left</a>
<a id='line_9616'>  Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat</a>
<a id='line_9617'>  Round the stone table under the dark pine, [K]</a>
<a id='line_9618'>  Friendly to studious or to festive hours;</a>
<a id='line_9619'>  Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,                            50</a>
<a id='line_9620'>  The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed</a>
<a id='line_9621'>  Within our garden, [L] found himself at once,</a>
<a id='line_9622'>  As if by trick insidious and unkind,</a>
<a id='line_9623'>  Stripped of his voice [M] and left to dimple down</a>
<a id='line_9624'>  (Without an effort and without a will)                              55</a>
<a id='line_9625'>  A channel paved by man's officious care. [N]</a>
<a id='line_9626'>  I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,</a>
<a id='line_9627'>  And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts, [O]</a>
<a id='line_9628'>  "Ha," quoth I, "pretty prisoner, are you there!"</a>
<a id='line_9629'>  Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,                     60</a>
<a id='line_9630'>  "An emblem here behold of thy own life;</a>
<a id='line_9631'>  In its late course of even days with all</a>
<a id='line_9632'>  Their smooth enthralment;" but the heart was full,</a>
<a id='line_9633'>  Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame</a>
<a id='line_9634'>  Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;                           65</a>
<a id='line_9635'>  I willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.</a>
<a id='line_9636'>--The face of every neighbour whom I met</a>
<a id='line_9637'>  Was like a volume to me; some were hailed</a>
<a id='line_9638'>  Upon the road, some busy at their work,</a>
<a id='line_9639'>  Unceremonious greetings interchanged                                70</a>
<a id='line_9640'>  With half the length of a long field between.</a>
<a id='line_9641'>  Among my schoolfellows I scattered round</a>
<a id='line_9642'>  Like recognitions, but with some constraint</a>
<a id='line_9643'>  Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,</a>
<a id='line_9644'>  But with more shame, for my habiliments,                            75</a>
<a id='line_9645'>  The transformation wrought by gay attire.</a>
<a id='line_9646'>  Not less delighted did I take my place</a>
<a id='line_9647'>  At our domestic table: and, [P] dear Friend</a>
<a id='line_9648'>  In this endeavour simply to relate</a>
<a id='line_9649'>  A Poet's history, may I leave untold                                80</a>
<a id='line_9650'>  The thankfulness with which I laid me down</a>
<a id='line_9651'>  In my accustomed bed, more welcome now</a>
<a id='line_9652'>  Perhaps than if it had been more desired</a>
<a id='line_9653'>  Or been more often thought of with regret;</a>
<a id='line_9654'>  That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind                          85</a>
<a id='line_9655'>  Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft</a>
<a id='line_9656'>  Had lain awake on summer nights to watch</a>
<a id='line_9657'>  The moon in splendour couched among the leaves</a>
<a id='line_9658'>  Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood; [Q]</a>
<a id='line_9659'>  Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro                    90</a>
<a id='line_9660'>  In the dark summit of the waving tree</a>
<a id='line_9661'>  She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.</a>
<a id='line_9662'></a>
<a id='line_9663'>    Among the favourites whom it pleased me well</a>
<a id='line_9664'>  To see again, was one by ancient right</a>
<a id='line_9665'>  Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;                           95</a>
<a id='line_9666'>  By birth and call of nature pre-ordained</a>
<a id='line_9667'>  To hunt the badger and unearth the fox</a>
<a id='line_9668'>  Among the impervious crags, but having been</a>
<a id='line_9669'>  From youth our own adopted, he had passed</a>
<a id='line_9670'>  Into a gentler service. And when first                             100</a>
<a id='line_9671'>  The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day</a>
<a id='line_9672'>  Along my veins I kindled with the stir,</a>
<a id='line_9673'>  The fermentation, and the vernal heat</a>
<a id='line_9674'>  Of poesy, affecting private shades</a>
<a id='line_9675'>  Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used                          105</a>
<a id='line_9676'>  To watch me, an attendant and a friend,</a>
<a id='line_9677'>  Obsequious to my steps early and late,</a>
<a id='line_9678'>  Though often of such dilatory walk</a>
<a id='line_9679'>  Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.</a>
<a id='line_9680'>  A hundred times when, roving high and low                          110</a>
<a id='line_9681'>  I have been harassed with the toil of verse,</a>
<a id='line_9682'>  Much pains and little progress, and at once</a>
<a id='line_9683'>  Some lovely Image in the song rose up</a>
<a id='line_9684'>  Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;</a>
<a id='line_9685'>  Then have I darted forwards to let                                 115</a>
<a id='line_9686'>  My hand upon his back with stormy joy,</a>
<a id='line_9687'>  Caressing him again and yet again.</a>
<a id='line_9688'>  And when at evening on the public way</a>
<a id='line_9689'>  I sauntered, like a river murmuring</a>
<a id='line_9690'>  And talking to itself when all things                              120</a>
<a id='line_9691'>  Are still, the creature trotted on before;</a>
<a id='line_9692'>  Such was his custom; but whene'er he met</a>
<a id='line_9693'>  A passenger approaching, he would turn</a>
<a id='line_9694'>  To give me timely notice, and straightway,</a>
<a id='line_9695'>  Grateful for that admonishment, I                                  125</a>
<a id='line_9696'>  My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air</a>
<a id='line_9697'>  And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced</a>
<a id='line_9698'>  To give and take a greeting that might save</a>
<a id='line_9699'>  My name from piteous rumours, such as wait</a>
<a id='line_9700'>  On men suspected to be crazed in brain.                            130</a>
<a id='line_9701'></a>
<a id='line_9702'>  Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved--</a>
<a id='line_9703'>  Regretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,</a>
<a id='line_9704'>  But they were richly laden with all good,</a>
<a id='line_9705'>  And cannot be remembered but with thanks</a>
<a id='line_9706'>  And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart--135</a>
<a id='line_9707'>  Those walks in all their freshness now came back</a>
<a id='line_9708'>  Like a returning Spring. When first I made</a>
<a id='line_9709'>  Once more the circuit of our little lake,</a>
<a id='line_9710'>  If ever happiness hath lodged with man,</a>
<a id='line_9711'>  That day consummate happiness was mine,                            140</a>
<a id='line_9712'>  Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.</a>
<a id='line_9713'>  The sun was set, or setting, when I left</a>
<a id='line_9714'>  Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on</a>
<a id='line_9715'>  A sober hour, not winning or serene,</a>
<a id='line_9716'>  For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;                         145</a>
<a id='line_9717'>  But as a face we love is sweetest then</a>
<a id='line_9718'>  When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look</a>
<a id='line_9719'>  It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart</a>
<a id='line_9720'>  Have fulness in herself; even so with me</a>
<a id='line_9721'>  It fared that evening. Gently did my soul                          150</a>
<a id='line_9722'>  Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood</a>
<a id='line_9723'>  Naked, as in the presence of her God.</a>
<a id='line_9724'>  While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch</a>
<a id='line_9725'>  A heart that had not been disconsolate:</a>
<a id='line_9726'>  Strength came where weakness was not known to be,                  155</a>
<a id='line_9727'>  At least not felt; and restoration came</a>
<a id='line_9728'>  Like an intruder knocking at the door</a>
<a id='line_9729'>  Of unacknowledged weariness. I took</a>
<a id='line_9730'>  The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.</a>
<a id='line_9731'>--Of that external scene which round me lay,                       160</a>
<a id='line_9732'>  Little, in this abstraction, did I see;</a>
<a id='line_9733'>  Remembered less; but I had inward hopes</a>
<a id='line_9734'>  And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,</a>
<a id='line_9735'>  Conversed with promises, had glimmering views</a>
<a id='line_9736'>  How life pervades the undecaying mind;                             165</a>
<a id='line_9737'>  How the immortal soul with God-like power</a>
<a id='line_9738'>  Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep</a>
<a id='line_9739'>  That time can lay upon her; how on earth,</a>
<a id='line_9740'>  Man, if he do but live within the light</a>
<a id='line_9741'>  Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad                           170</a>
<a id='line_9742'>  His being armed with strength that cannot fail.</a>
<a id='line_9743'>  Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love</a>
<a id='line_9744'>  Of innocence, and holiday repose;</a>
<a id='line_9745'>  And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir</a>
<a id='line_9746'>  Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end                            175</a>
<a id='line_9747'>  At last, or glorious, by endurance won.</a>
<a id='line_9748'>  Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down</a>
<a id='line_9749'>  Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes</a>
<a id='line_9750'>  And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread</a>
<a id='line_9751'>  With darkness, and before a rippling breeze                        180</a>
<a id='line_9752'>  The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,</a>
<a id='line_9753'>  And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,</a>
<a id='line_9754'>  Around me from among the hazel leaves,</a>
<a id='line_9755'>  Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,</a>
<a id='line_9756'>  Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,                            185</a>
<a id='line_9757'>  Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,</a>
<a id='line_9758'>  The off and on companion of my walk;</a>
<a id='line_9759'>  And such, at times, believing them to be,</a>
<a id='line_9760'>  I turned my head to look if he were there;</a>
<a id='line_9761'>  Then into solemn thought I passed once more.                       190</a>
<a id='line_9762'></a>
<a id='line_9763'>  A freshness also found I at this time</a>
<a id='line_9764'>  In human Life, the daily life of those</a>
<a id='line_9765'>  Whose occupations really I loved;</a>
<a id='line_9766'>  The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise</a>
<a id='line_9767'>  Changed like a garden in the heat of spring                        195</a>
<a id='line_9768'>  After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit</a>
<a id='line_9769'>  The things which were the same and yet appeared</a>
<a id='line_9770'>  Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,</a>
<a id='line_9771'>  A narrow Vale where each was known to all,</a>
<a id='line_9772'>  'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind                           200</a>
<a id='line_9773'>  To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,</a>
<a id='line_9774'>  Where an old man had used to sit alone,</a>
<a id='line_9775'>  Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left</a>
<a id='line_9776'>  In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet</a>
<a id='line_9777'>  Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;                       205</a>
<a id='line_9778'>  And growing girls whose beauty, filched away</a>
<a id='line_9779'>  With all its pleasant promises, was gone</a>
<a id='line_9780'>  To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.</a>
<a id='line_9781'></a>
<a id='line_9782'>    Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,</a>
<a id='line_9783'>  And often looking round was moved to smiles                        210</a>
<a id='line_9784'>  Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;</a>
<a id='line_9785'>  I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_9786'>  Of those plain-living people now observed</a>
<a id='line_9787'>  With clearer knowledge; with another eye</a>
<a id='line_9788'>  I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,                              215</a>
<a id='line_9789'>  The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,</a>
<a id='line_9790'>  This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;</a>
<a id='line_9791'>  Saw her go forth to church or other work</a>
<a id='line_9792'>  Of state, equipped in monumental trim;</a>
<a id='line_9793'>  Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),                      220</a>
<a id='line_9794'>  A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers</a>
<a id='line_9795'>  Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,</a>
<a id='line_9796'>  Affectionate without disquietude,</a>
<a id='line_9797'>  Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less</a>
<a id='line_9798'>  Her clear though shallow stream of piety                           225</a>
<a id='line_9799'>  That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;</a>
<a id='line_9800'>  With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read</a>
<a id='line_9801'>  Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,</a>
<a id='line_9802'>  And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep</a>
<a id='line_9803'>  And made of it a pillow for her head.                              230</a>
<a id='line_9804'></a>
<a id='line_9805'>    Nor less do I remember to have felt,</a>
<a id='line_9806'>  Distinctly manifested at this time,</a>
<a id='line_9807'>  A human-heartedness about my love</a>
<a id='line_9808'>  For objects hitherto the absolute wealth</a>
<a id='line_9809'>  Of my own private being and no more:                               235</a>
<a id='line_9810'>  Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit</a>
<a id='line_9811'>  Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,</a>
<a id='line_9812'>  Might love in individual happiness.</a>
<a id='line_9813'>  But now there opened on me other thoughts</a>
<a id='line_9814'>  Of change, congratulation or regret,                               240</a>
<a id='line_9815'>  A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;</a>
<a id='line_9816'>  The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,</a>
<a id='line_9817'>  The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts--</a>
<a id='line_9818'>  White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,</a>
<a id='line_9819'>  Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,                         245</a>
<a id='line_9820'>  Acquaintances of every little child,</a>
<a id='line_9821'>  And Jupiter, my own beloved star!</a>
<a id='line_9822'>  Whatever shadings of mortality,</a>
<a id='line_9823'>  Whatever imports from the world of death</a>
<a id='line_9824'>  Had come among these objects heretofore,                           250</a>
<a id='line_9825'>  Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,</a>
<a id='line_9826'>  Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings</a>
<a id='line_9827'>  Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way</a>
<a id='line_9828'>  In later youth to yearnings of a love</a>
<a id='line_9829'>  Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.                                 255</a>
<a id='line_9830'></a>
<a id='line_9831'>    As one who hangs down-bending from the side</a>
<a id='line_9832'>  Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast</a>
<a id='line_9833'>  Of a still water, solacing himself</a>
<a id='line_9834'>  With such discoveries as his eye can make</a>
<a id='line_9835'>  Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,                             260</a>
<a id='line_9836'>  Sees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers.</a>
<a id='line_9837'>  Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,</a>
<a id='line_9838'>  Yet often is perplexed and cannot part</a>
<a id='line_9839'>  The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,</a>
<a id='line_9840'>  Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth                       265</a>
<a id='line_9841'>  Of the clear flood, from things which there abide</a>
<a id='line_9842'>  In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam</a>
<a id='line_9843'>  Of his own image, by a sun-beam now,</a>
<a id='line_9844'>  And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,</a>
<a id='line_9845'>  Impediments that make his task more sweet;                         270</a>
<a id='line_9846'>  Such pleasant office have we long pursued</a>
<a id='line_9847'>  Incumbent o'er the surface of past time</a>
<a id='line_9848'>  With like success, nor often have appeared</a>
<a id='line_9849'>  Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned</a>
<a id='line_9850'>  Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!                    275</a>
<a id='line_9851'>  Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite</a>
<a id='line_9852'>  Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,</a>
<a id='line_9853'>  There was an inner falling off--I loved,</a>
<a id='line_9854'>  Loved deeply all that had been loved before,</a>
<a id='line_9855'>  More deeply even than ever: but a swarm                            280</a>
<a id='line_9856'>  Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,</a>
<a id='line_9857'>  And feast and dance, and public revelry,</a>
<a id='line_9858'>  And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,</a>
<a id='line_9859'>  Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,</a>
<a id='line_9860'>  Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh                         285</a>
<a id='line_9861'>  Of manliness and freedom) all conspired</a>
<a id='line_9862'>  To lure my mind from firm habitual quest</a>
<a id='line_9863'>  Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal</a>
<a id='line_9864'>  And damp those yearnings which had once been mine--</a>
<a id='line_9865'>  A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up                           290</a>
<a id='line_9866'>  To his own eager thoughts. It would demand</a>
<a id='line_9867'>  Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,</a>
<a id='line_9868'>  To paint these vanities, and how they wrought</a>
<a id='line_9869'>  In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.</a>
<a id='line_9870'>  It seemed the very garments that I wore                            295</a>
<a id='line_9871'>  Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream</a>
<a id='line_9872'>  Of self-forgetfulness.</a>
<a id='line_9873'>                         Yes, that heartless chase</a>
<a id='line_9874'>  Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange</a>
<a id='line_9875'>  For books and nature at that early age.</a>
<a id='line_9876'>  'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained                   300</a>
<a id='line_9877'>  Of character or life; but at that time,</a>
<a id='line_9878'>  Of manners put to school I took small note,</a>
<a id='line_9879'>  And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.</a>
<a id='line_9880'>  Far better had it been to exalt the mind</a>
<a id='line_9881'>  By solitary study, to uphold                                       305</a>
<a id='line_9882'>  Intense desire through meditative peace;</a>
<a id='line_9883'>  And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,</a>
<a id='line_9884'>  The memory of one particular hour</a>
<a id='line_9885'>  Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng</a>
<a id='line_9886'>  Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,                   310</a>
<a id='line_9887'>  A medley of all tempers, I had passed</a>
<a id='line_9888'>  The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,</a>
<a id='line_9889'>  With din of instruments and shuffling feet,</a>
<a id='line_9890'>  And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,</a>
<a id='line_9891'>  And unaimed prattle flying up and down; [R]                        315</a>
<a id='line_9892'>  Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there</a>
<a id='line_9893'>  Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,</a>
<a id='line_9894'>  Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,</a>
<a id='line_9895'>  And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,</a>
<a id='line_9896'>  The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky                       320</a>
<a id='line_9897'>  Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse</a>
<a id='line_9898'>  And open field, through which the pathway wound,</a>
<a id='line_9899'>  And homeward led my steps. Magnificent</a>
<a id='line_9900'>  The morning rose, in memorable pomp,</a>
<a id='line_9901'>  Glorious as e'er I had beheld--in front,                           325</a>
<a id='line_9902'>  The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,</a>
<a id='line_9903'>  The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,</a>
<a id='line_9904'>  Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;</a>
<a id='line_9905'>  And in the meadows and the lower grounds</a>
<a id='line_9906'>  Was all the sweetness of a common dawn--330</a>
<a id='line_9907'>  Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, [S]</a>
<a id='line_9908'>  And labourers going forth to till the fields.</a>
<a id='line_9909'>  Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim</a>
<a id='line_9910'>  My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows</a>
<a id='line_9911'>  Were then made for me; bond unknown to me                          335</a>
<a id='line_9912'>  Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,</a>
<a id='line_9913'>  A dedicated Spirit. On I walked</a>
<a id='line_9914'>  In thankful blessedness, which yet survives. [T]</a>
<a id='line_9915'></a>
<a id='line_9916'>    Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time</a>
<a id='line_9917'>  A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,                            340</a>
<a id='line_9918'>  Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;</a>
<a id='line_9919'>  Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,</a>
<a id='line_9920'>  Consorting in one mansion unreproved.</a>
<a id='line_9921'>  The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,</a>
<a id='line_9922'>  Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,                      345</a>
<a id='line_9923'>  That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts</a>
<a id='line_9924'>  Transient and idle, lacked not intervals</a>
<a id='line_9925'>  When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time</a>
<a id='line_9926'>  Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself</a>
<a id='line_9927'>  Conformity as just as that of old                                  350</a>
<a id='line_9928'>  To the end and written spirit of God's works,</a>
<a id='line_9929'>  Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,</a>
<a id='line_9930'>  Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.</a>
<a id='line_9931'></a>
<a id='line_9932'>    When from our better selves we have too long</a>
<a id='line_9933'>  Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,                      355</a>
<a id='line_9934'>  Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,</a>
<a id='line_9935'>  How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;</a>
<a id='line_9936'>  How potent a mere image of her sway;</a>
<a id='line_9937'>  Most potent when impressed upon the mind</a>
<a id='line_9938'>  With an appropriate human centre--hermit,                          360</a>
<a id='line_9939'>  Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;</a>
<a id='line_9940'>  Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot</a>
<a id='line_9941'>  Is treading, where no other face is seen)</a>
<a id='line_9942'>  Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top</a>
<a id='line_9943'>  Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;                           365</a>
<a id='line_9944'>  Or as the soul of that great Power is met</a>
<a id='line_9945'>  Sometimes embodied on a public road,</a>
<a id='line_9946'>  When, for the night deserted, it assumes</a>
<a id='line_9947'>  A character of quiet more profound</a>
<a id='line_9948'>  Than pathless wastes.</a>
<a id='line_9949'>                      Once, when those summer months                 370</a>
<a id='line_9950'>  Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show</a>
<a id='line_9951'>  Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,</a>
<a id='line_9952'>  Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced</a>
<a id='line_9953'>  That--after I had left a flower-decked room</a>
<a id='line_9954'>  (Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived                       375</a>
<a id='line_9955'>  To a late hour), and spirits overwrought</a>
<a id='line_9956'>  Were making night do penance for a day</a>
<a id='line_9957'>  Spent in a round of strenuous idleness--[U]</a>
<a id='line_9958'>  My homeward course led up a long ascent,</a>
<a id='line_9959'>  Where the road's watery surface, to the top                        380</a>
<a id='line_9960'>  Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon</a>
<a id='line_9961'>  And bore the semblance of another stream</a>
<a id='line_9962'>  Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook</a>
<a id='line_9963'>  That murmured in the vale. [V] All else was still;</a>
<a id='line_9964'>  No living thing appeared in earth or air,                          385</a>
<a id='line_9965'>  And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,</a>
<a id='line_9966'>  Sound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,</a>
<a id='line_9967'>  Shown by a sudden turning of the road,</a>
<a id='line_9968'>  So near that, slipping back into the shade</a>
<a id='line_9969'>  Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,                        390</a>
<a id='line_9970'>  Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,</a>
<a id='line_9971'>  A span above man's common measure, tall,</a>
<a id='line_9972'>  Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man</a>
<a id='line_9973'>  Was never seen before by night or day.</a>
<a id='line_9974'>  Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth                    395</a>
<a id='line_9975'>  Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,</a>
<a id='line_9976'>  A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken</a>
<a id='line_9977'>  That he was clothed in military garb,</a>
<a id='line_9978'>  Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,</a>
<a id='line_9979'>  No dog attending, by no staff sustained,                           400</a>
<a id='line_9980'>  He stood, and in his very dress appeared</a>
<a id='line_9981'>  A desolation, a simplicity,</a>
<a id='line_9982'>  To which the trappings of a gaudy world</a>
<a id='line_9983'>  Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,</a>
<a id='line_9984'>  Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain                          405</a>
<a id='line_9985'>  Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form</a>
<a id='line_9986'>  Kept the same awful steadiness--at his feet</a>
<a id='line_9987'>  His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame</a>
<a id='line_9988'>  Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length</a>
<a id='line_9989'>  Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,                            410</a>
<a id='line_9990'>  I left the shady nook where I had stood</a>
<a id='line_9991'>  And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place</a>
<a id='line_9992'>  He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm</a>
<a id='line_9993'>  In measured gesture lifted to his head</a>
<a id='line_9994'>  Returned my salutation; then resumed                               415</a>
<a id='line_9995'>  His station as before; and when I asked</a>
<a id='line_9996'>  His history, the veteran, in reply,</a>
<a id='line_9997'>  Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,</a>
<a id='line_9998'>  And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,</a>
<a id='line_9999'>  A stately air of mild indifference,                                420</a>
<a id='line_10000'>  He told in few plain words a soldier's tale--</a>
<a id='line_10001'>  That in the Tropic Islands he had served,</a>
<a id='line_10002'>  Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past:</a>
<a id='line_10003'>  That on his landing he had been dismissed,</a>
<a id='line_10004'>  And now was travelling towards his native home.                    425</a>
<a id='line_10005'>  This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with me."</a>
<a id='line_10006'>  He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up</a>
<a id='line_10007'>  An oaken staff by me yet unobserved--</a>
<a id='line_10008'>  A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand</a>
<a id='line_10009'>  And lay till now neglected in the grass.                           430</a>
<a id='line_10010'>  Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared</a>
<a id='line_10011'>  To travel without pain, and I beheld,</a>
<a id='line_10012'>  With an astonishment but ill suppressed,</a>
<a id='line_10013'>  His ghostly figure moving at my side;</a>
<a id='line_10014'>  Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear                      435</a>
<a id='line_10015'>  To turn from present hardships to the past,</a>
<a id='line_10016'>  And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,</a>
<a id='line_10017'>  Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,</a>
<a id='line_10018'>  On what he might himself have seen or felt.</a>
<a id='line_10019'>  He all the while was in demeanour calm,                            440</a>
<a id='line_10020'>  Concise in answer; solemn and sublime</a>
<a id='line_10021'>  He might have seemed, but that in all he said</a>
<a id='line_10022'>  There was a strange half-absence, as of one</a>
<a id='line_10023'>  Knowing too well the importance of his theme,</a>
<a id='line_10024'>  But feeling it no longer. Our discourse                            445</a>
<a id='line_10025'>  Soon ended, and together on we passed</a>
<a id='line_10026'>  In silence through a wood gloomy and still.</a>
<a id='line_10027'>  Up-turning, then, along an open field,</a>
<a id='line_10028'>  We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,</a>
<a id='line_10029'>  And earnestly to charitable care                                   450</a>
<a id='line_10030'>  Commended him as a poor friendless man,</a>
<a id='line_10031'>  Belated and by sickness overcome.</a>
<a id='line_10032'>  Assured that now the traveller would repose</a>
<a id='line_10033'>  In comfort, I entreated that henceforth</a>
<a id='line_10034'>  He would not linger in the public ways,                            455</a>
<a id='line_10035'>  But ask for timely furtherance and help</a>
<a id='line_10036'>  Such as his state required. At this reproof,</a>
<a id='line_10037'>  With the same ghastly mildness in his look,</a>
<a id='line_10038'>  He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_10039'>  And in the eye of him who passes me!"                              460</a>
<a id='line_10040'></a>
<a id='line_10041'>    The cottage door was speedily unbarred,</a>
<a id='line_10042'>  And now the soldier touched his hat once more</a>
<a id='line_10043'>  With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,</a>
<a id='line_10044'>  Whose tone bespake reviving interests</a>
<a id='line_10045'>  Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned                        465</a>
<a id='line_10046'>  The farewell blessing of the patient man,</a>
<a id='line_10047'>  And so we parted. Back I cast a look,</a>
<a id='line_10048'>  And lingered near the door a little space,</a>
<a id='line_10049'>  Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.</a>

<a id='line_10093'>Colthouse, on the opposite side of the Vale, and lived there for some</a>
<a id='line_10094'>time before her death. Along with Dr. Cradock I examined the Parish</a>
<a id='line_10095'>Registers of Hawkshead in the autumn of 1882, and we found the following</a>
<a id='line_10096'>entry belonging to the year 1796.</a>
<a id='line_10097'></a>
<a id='line_10098'>  "Anne Tyson of Colthouse, widow, died May 25th buried 28th, in</a>
<a id='line_10099'>  Churchyard, aged 83."</a>
<a id='line_10100'></a>
<a id='line_10101'>Her removal to Colthouse is confirmed, in a curious way, by a</a>
<a id='line_10102'>reminiscence of William Wordsworth's (the poet's son), who told me that</a>
<a id='line_10103'>if asked where the dame's house was, he would have pointed to a spot on</a>
<a id='line_10104'>the eastern side of the valley, and out of the village altogether; his</a>
<a id='line_10105'>father having taken him from Rydal Mount to Hawkshead when a mere boy,</a>
<a id='line_10106'>and pointed out that spot. Doubtless Wordsworth took his son to the</a>
<a id='line_10107'>cottage at Colthouse, where Anne Tyson died, as the earlier abode in</a>
<a id='line_10108'>Hawkshead village is well known, and its site is indisputable.--Ed.]</a>

<a id='line_10131'>one of the alleys of Hawkshead.</a>
<a id='line_10132'></a>
<a id='line_10133'>  "Persons have visited the cottage," wrote Dr. Cradock, "without</a>
<a id='line_10134'>  discovering it; and yet it is not forty yards distant, and is still</a>
<a id='line_10135'>  exactly as described. On the opposite side of the lane leading to the</a>
<a id='line_10136'>  cottage, and a few steps above it, is a narrow passage through some</a>
<a id='line_10137'>  new stone buildings. On emerging from this, you meet a small garden,</a>
<a id='line_10138'>  the farther side of which is bounded by the brook, confined on both</a>
<a id='line_10139'>  sides by larger flags, and also covered by flags of the same Coniston</a>
<a id='line_10140'>  formation, through the interstices of which you may see and hear the</a>
<a id='line_10141'>  stream running freely. The upper flags are now used as a footpath, and</a>
<a id='line_10142'>  lead by another passage back into the village. No doubt the garden has</a>
<a id='line_10143'>  been reduced in size, by the use of that part of it fronting the lane</a>
<a id='line_10144'>  for building purposes. The stream, before it enters the area of</a>
<a id='line_10145'>  buildings and gardens, is open by the lane side, and seemingly comes</a>
<a id='line_10146'>  from the hills to the westwards. The large flags are extremely hard</a>
<a id='line_10147'>  and durable, and it is probably that the very flags which paved the</a>

<a id='line_10151'>Possibly, however, some of the boys had free access to the latter, so</a>
<a id='line_10152'>that Wordsworth could speak of it as "our garden;" or, Dame Tyson may</a>

<a id='line_10192'>  "From the village, nay, from the poet's very door when he lived at</a>
<a id='line_10193'>  Anne Tyson's, a good path leads on, past the vicarage, quite to its</a>
<a id='line_10194'>  upland place of birth. It has eaten its way deeply into the soil; in</a>
<a id='line_10195'>  one place there is a series of still pools, that overflow and fall</a>
<a id='line_10196'>  into others, with quiet sound; at other spots, it is bustling and</a>
<a id='line_10197'>  busy. Fine timber is found on either side of it, the roots of the</a>
<a id='line_10198'>  trees often laid bare by the passing current. In one or two places by</a>
<a id='line_10199'>  the side of this beck, and beneath the shadow of lofty oaks, may be</a>
<a id='line_10200'>  found boulder stones, grey and moss-covered. Birds make hiding-places</a>
<a id='line_10201'>  for themselves in these oak and hazel bushes by the stream. Following</a>
<a id='line_10202'>  it up, we find it receives, at a tiny ford, the tribute of another</a>
<a id='line_10203'>  stream from the north-west, and comes down between the adjacent hills</a>
<a id='line_10204'>  (well wooded to the summit) from meadows of short-cropped grass, and</a>
<a id='line_10205'>  to these from the open moorland, where it takes its rise. Every</a>
<a id='line_10206'>  conceivable variety of beauty of sound and sight in streamlet life is</a>
<a id='line_10207'>  found as we follow the course of this Town Beck. We owe much of</a>
<a id='line_10208'>  Wordsworth's intimate acquaintance with streamlet beauty to it."</a>

<a id='line_10296'>  That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,</a>
<a id='line_10297'>  Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine</a>

<a id='line_10299'>  Through length of time, by patient exercise</a>
<a id='line_10300'>  Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is                      10</a>
<a id='line_10301'>  That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto,</a>
<a id='line_10302'>  In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked</a>
<a id='line_10303'>  Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven</a>
<a id='line_10304'>  As her prime teacher, intercourse with man</a>

<a id='line_10306'>  Who through that bodily image hath diffused,</a>
<a id='line_10307'>  As might appear to the eye of fleeting time,</a>
<a id='line_10308'>  A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought,</a>
<a id='line_10309'>  For commerce of thy nature with herself,</a>

<a id='line_10311'>  And yet we feel--we cannot choose but feel--</a>
<a id='line_10312'>  That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart</a>
<a id='line_10313'>  It gives, to think that our immortal being</a>

<a id='line_10340'></a>
<a id='line_10341'>    One day, when from my lips a like complaint                       50</a>

<a id='line_10343'>  He with a smile made answer, that in truth</a>

<a id='line_10346'>  That he himself had oftentimes given way                            55</a>
<a id='line_10347'>  To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,</a>
<a id='line_10348'>  That once in the stillness of a summer's noon,</a>
<a id='line_10349'>  While I was seated in a rocky cave</a>
<a id='line_10350'>  By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,</a>
<a id='line_10351'>  The famous history of the errant knight                             60</a>
<a id='line_10352'>  Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts</a>
<a id='line_10353'>  Beset me, and to height unusual rose,</a>
<a id='line_10354'>  While listlessly I sate, and, having closed</a>
<a id='line_10355'>  The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.</a>
<a id='line_10356'>  On poetry and geometric truth,                                      65</a>
<a id='line_10357'>  And their high privilege of lasting life,</a>
<a id='line_10358'>  From all internal injury exempt,</a>
<a id='line_10359'>  I mused, upon these chiefly: and at length,</a>
<a id='line_10360'>  My senses yielding to the sultry air,</a>
<a id='line_10361'>  Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream.                         70</a>
<a id='line_10362'>  I saw before me stretched a boundless plain</a>
<a id='line_10363'>  Of sandy wilderness, all black and void,</a>
<a id='line_10364'>  And as I looked around, distress and fear</a>
<a id='line_10365'>  Came creeping over me, when at my side,</a>
<a id='line_10366'>  Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared                         75</a>
<a id='line_10367'>  Upon a dromedary, mounted high.</a>
<a id='line_10368'>  He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:</a>
<a id='line_10369'>  A lance he bore, and underneath one arm</a>
<a id='line_10370'>  A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell</a>
<a id='line_10371'>  Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight                            80</a>
<a id='line_10372'>  Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide</a>
<a id='line_10373'>  Was present, one who with unerring skill</a>
<a id='line_10374'>  Would through the desert lead me; and while yet</a>
<a id='line_10375'>  I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight</a>
<a id='line_10376'>  Which the new-comer carried through the waste                       85</a>
<a id='line_10377'>  Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone</a>
<a id='line_10378'>  (To give it in the language of the dream)</a>
<a id='line_10379'>  Was "Euclid's Elements;" and "This," said he,</a>
<a id='line_10380'>  "Is something of more worth;" and at the word</a>
<a id='line_10381'>  Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,                   90</a>
<a id='line_10382'>  In colour so resplendent, with command</a>
<a id='line_10383'>  That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,</a>
<a id='line_10384'>  And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,</a>
<a id='line_10385'>  Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,</a>
<a id='line_10386'>  A loud prophetic blast of harmony;                                  95</a>
<a id='line_10387'>  An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold</a>
<a id='line_10388'>  Destruction to the children of the earth</a>
<a id='line_10389'>  By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased</a>
<a id='line_10390'>  The song, than the Arab with calm look declared</a>
<a id='line_10391'>  That all would come to pass of which the voice                     100</a>
<a id='line_10392'>  Had given forewarning, and that he himself</a>
<a id='line_10393'>  Was going then to bury those two books:</a>
<a id='line_10394'>  The one that held acquaintance with the stars,</a>
<a id='line_10395'>  And wedded soul to soul in purest bond</a>
<a id='line_10396'>  Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;                           105</a>
<a id='line_10397'>  The other that was a god, yea many gods,</a>
<a id='line_10398'>  Had voices more than all the winds, with power</a>
<a id='line_10399'>  To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,</a>
<a id='line_10400'>  Through every clime, the heart of human kind.</a>
<a id='line_10401'>  While this was uttering, strange as it may seem,                   110</a>
<a id='line_10402'>  I wondered not, although I plainly saw</a>
<a id='line_10403'>  The one to be a stone, the other a shell;</a>
<a id='line_10404'>  Nor doubted once but that they both were books,</a>
<a id='line_10405'>  Having a perfect faith in all that passed.</a>
<a id='line_10406'>  Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt                          115</a>
<a id='line_10407'>  To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed</a>
<a id='line_10408'>  To share his enterprise, he hurried on</a>
<a id='line_10409'>  Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,</a>
<a id='line_10410'>  For oftentimes he cast a backward look,</a>
<a id='line_10411'>  Grasping his twofold treasure.--Lance in rest,                     120</a>
<a id='line_10412'>  He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now</a>
<a id='line_10413'>  He, to my fancy, had become the knight</a>
<a id='line_10414'>  Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,</a>
<a id='line_10415'>  But was an Arab of the desert too;</a>
<a id='line_10416'>  Of these was neither, and was both at once.                        125</a>
<a id='line_10417'>  His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;</a>
<a id='line_10418'>  And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_10419'>  Saw, over half the wilderness diffused,</a>
<a id='line_10420'>  A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:</a>
<a id='line_10421'>  "It is," said he, "the waters of the deep                          130</a>
<a id='line_10422'>  Gathering upon us;" quickening then the pace</a>
<a id='line_10423'>  Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,</a>
<a id='line_10424'>  He left me: I called after him aloud;</a>
<a id='line_10425'>  He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge</a>
<a id='line_10426'>  Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,                       135</a>
<a id='line_10427'>  Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,</a>
<a id='line_10428'>  With the fleet waters of a drowning world</a>
<a id='line_10429'>  In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,</a>
<a id='line_10430'>  And saw the sea before me, and the book,</a>
<a id='line_10431'>  In which I had been reading, at my side. [D]                       140</a>
<a id='line_10432'></a>
<a id='line_10433'>    Full often, taking from the world of sleep</a>
<a id='line_10434'>  This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,</a>
<a id='line_10435'>  This semi-Quixote, I to him have given</a>
<a id='line_10436'>  A substance, fancied him a living man,</a>
<a id='line_10437'>  A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed                             145</a>
<a id='line_10438'>  By love and feeling, and internal thought</a>
<a id='line_10439'>  Protracted among endless solitudes;</a>
<a id='line_10440'>  Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!</a>
<a id='line_10441'>  Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt</a>
<a id='line_10442'>  Reverence was due to a being thus employed;                        150</a>
<a id='line_10443'>  And thought that, in the blind and awful lair</a>
<a id='line_10444'>  Of such a madness, reason did lie couched.</a>
<a id='line_10445'>  Enow there are on earth to take in charge</a>
<a id='line_10446'>  Their wives, their children, and their virgin loves,</a>
<a id='line_10447'>  Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;                           155</a>
<a id='line_10448'>  Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say,</a>
<a id='line_10449'>  Contemplating in soberness the approach</a>
<a id='line_10450'>  Of an event so dire, by signs in earth</a>
<a id='line_10451'>  Or heaven made manifest, that I could share</a>
<a id='line_10452'>  That maniac's fond anxiety, and go                                 160</a>
<a id='line_10453'>  Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least</a>
<a id='line_10454'>  Me hath such strong enhancement overcome,</a>
<a id='line_10455'>  When I have held a volume in my hand,</a>
<a id='line_10456'>  Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,</a>
<a id='line_10457'>  Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!                          165</a>
<a id='line_10458'></a>
<a id='line_10459'>    Great and benign, indeed, must be the power</a>
<a id='line_10460'>  Of living nature, which could thus so long</a>
<a id='line_10461'>  Detain me from the best of other guides</a>
<a id='line_10462'>  And dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,</a>
<a id='line_10463'>  Even in the time of lisping infancy;                               170</a>
<a id='line_10464'>  And later down, in prattling childhood even,</a>
<a id='line_10465'>  While I was travelling back among those days,</a>
<a id='line_10466'>  How could I ever play an ingrate's part?</a>
<a id='line_10467'>  Once more should I have made those bowers resound,</a>
<a id='line_10468'>  By intermingling strains of thankfulness                           175</a>
<a id='line_10469'>  With their own thoughtless melodies; at least</a>
<a id='line_10470'>  It might have well beseemed me to repeat</a>
<a id='line_10471'>  Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,</a>
<a id='line_10472'>  In slender accents of sweet verse, some tale</a>
<a id='line_10473'>  That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now.                      180</a>
<a id='line_10474'>  O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,</a>
<a id='line_10475'>  Think not that I could pass along untouched</a>

<a id='line_11027'>    'A bed of glittering light'</a>

<a id='line_11037'>  Castilian wind-mills into giants, and the roar of the fulling mills</a>
<a id='line_11038'>  into the din of war.</a>

<a id='line_11053'>  then proceeding to read exciting, unnatural tales of love and war, he</a>
<a id='line_11054'>  would not have gone mad.</a>

<a id='line_11087'>Hawkshead School, were his mother and the Rev. Mr. Gilbanks at</a>
<a id='line_11088'>Cockermouth, and Mrs. Anne Birkett at Penrith. His mother and Dame</a>
<a id='line_11089'>Birkett taught him to read, and trained his infant memory. Mr. Gilbanks</a>
<a id='line_11090'>also gave him elementary instruction; while his father made him commit</a>
<a id='line_11091'>to memory portions of the English poets. At Hawkshead he read English</a>
<a id='line_11092'>literature, learned Latin and Mathematics, and wrote both English and</a>
<a id='line_11093'>Latin verse. There was little or no method, and no mechanical or</a>
<a id='line_11094'>artificial drill in his early education. Though he was taught both</a>
<a id='line_11095'>languages and mathematics he was left as free to range the "happy</a>
<a id='line_11096'>pastures" of literature, as to range the Hawkshead woods on autumn</a>
<a id='line_11097'>nights in pursuit of woodcocks. It is likely that the reference in the</a>
<a id='line_11098'>above passage is to his education both in childhood and in youth,</a>
<a id='line_11099'>although specially to the former. In his 'Autobiographical Memoranda',</a>
<a id='line_11100'>Wordsworth says,</a>
<a id='line_11101'></a>
<a id='line_11102'>  "Of my earliest days at School I have little to say, but that they</a>
<a id='line_11103'>  were very happy ones, chiefly because I was left at liberty, then and</a>
<a id='line_11104'>  in the vacations, to read whatever books I liked. For example, I read</a>
<a id='line_11105'>  all Fielding's works, 'Don Quixote',  'Gil Blas', and any part of</a>

<a id='line_11158'>time. The main school-room is on the ground floor. One small chamber on</a>
<a id='line_11159'>the first floor was used, in the end of last century, by the head</a>
<a id='line_11160'>master, as a private class-room, for teaching a few advanced pupils. In</a>
<a id='line_11161'>another is a small library, formed in part by the donations of the</a>
<a id='line_11162'>scholars; it having been a custom for each pupil to present a volume on</a>
<a id='line_11163'>leaving the school, or to send one afterwards. Very probably one of the</a>
<a id='line_11164'>volumes now in the library was presented by Wordsworth. There are</a>
<a id='line_11165'>several which were presented by his school-fellows, during the years in</a>
<a id='line_11166'>which Wordsworth was at Hawkshead. The master, in 1877, promised me that</a>
<a id='line_11167'>he would search through his somewhat musty treasures, to see if he could</a>
<a id='line_11168'>discover a book with the poet's autograph; but I never heard of his</a>
<a id='line_11169'>success. On the wall of the room containing the library is a tablet,</a>

<a id='line_11894'>  Effort, and expectation, and desire,</a>

<a id='line_11909'>  Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road [1]</a>
<a id='line_11910'>  Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait, [Bb]</a>

<a id='line_11914'>  The stationary blasts of waterfalls,</a>
<a id='line_11915'>  And in the narrow rent at every turn</a>
<a id='line_11916'>  Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_11917'>  The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,</a>
<a id='line_11918'>  The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,                       630</a>

<a id='line_11922'>  The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,</a>
<a id='line_11923'>  Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--635</a>
<a id='line_11924'>  Were all like workings of one mind, the features</a>

<a id='line_11926'>  Characters of the great Apocalypse,</a>
<a id='line_11927'>  The types and symbols of Eternity,</a>

<a id='line_11929'></a>
<a id='line_11930'>    That night our lodging was a house that stood</a>

<a id='line_11938'></a>
<a id='line_11939'>    Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,</a>

<a id='line_11941'>  Into a lordly river, broad and deep,</a>
<a id='line_11942'>  Dimpling along in silent majesty,</a>

<a id='line_11944'>  Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,</a>

<a id='line_11967'>  In motion without pause; but ye have left</a>
<a id='line_11968'>  Your beauty with me, a serene accord</a>

<a id='line_11970'>  In their submissiveness with power as sweet                        680</a>

<a id='line_11974'>  Or mildest visitations of pure thought,</a>
<a id='line_11975'>  When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked                         685</a>

<a id='line_11988'>  Along the winding margin of the lake,</a>
<a id='line_11989'>  Led, as before, we should behold the scene</a>
<a id='line_11990'>  Hushed in profound repose. We left the town</a>
<a id='line_11991'>  Of Gravedona [Hh] with this hope; but soon                         700</a>

<a id='line_11995'>  From high, the sullen water far beneath,</a>
<a id='line_11996'>  On which a dull red image of the moon                              705</a>
<a id='line_11997'>  Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form</a>
<a id='line_11998'>  Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour</a>
<a id='line_11999'>  We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night</a>
<a id='line_12000'>  Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock</a>
<a id='line_12001'>  At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,                    710</a>
<a id='line_12002'>  But _could not_ sleep, tormented by the stings</a>
<a id='line_12003'>  Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,</a>

<a id='line_12005'>  The mountains more by blackness visible</a>
<a id='line_12006'>  And their own size, than any outward light;                        715</a>
<a id='line_12007'>  The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock</a>
<a id='line_12008'>  That told, with unintelligible voice,</a>

<a id='line_12010'>  And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,</a>

<a id='line_12012'>  And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set</a>
<a id='line_12013'>  Before us, while she still was high in heaven;--</a>

<a id='line_12018'></a>

<a id='line_12034'>  A different worship. Finally, whate'er</a>

<a id='line_12551'>  A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near</a>

<a id='line_12893'>  In whatsoever place, but seemed in this</a>
<a id='line_12894'>  A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.                         350</a>
<a id='line_12895'>  Of lusty vigour, more than infantine</a>

<a id='line_12905'>  And shameless women, treated and caressed;</a>
<a id='line_12906'>  Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,</a>
<a id='line_12907'>  While oaths and laughter and indecent speech</a>

<a id='line_14522'>bank fronting Anne Tyson's cottage at Hawkshead. It may have been a rock</a>
<a id='line_14523'>on the wooded slope of the rounded hill that rises west of Cowper</a>
<a id='line_14524'>Ground, north-west of Hawkshead. A rock "wet with springs" existed</a>

<a id='line_14715'></a>
<a id='line_14716'>    Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust</a>

<a id='line_14725'>  Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains</a>
<a id='line_14726'>  Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun, [H]</a>

<a id='line_14735'>  Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,                          85</a>

<a id='line_14741'>  Is shaking to the roots: indifference this</a>
<a id='line_14742'>  Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared</a>
<a id='line_14743'>  With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed</a>
<a id='line_14744'>  Into a theatre, whose stage was filled</a>
<a id='line_14745'>  And busy with an action far advanced.                               95</a>
<a id='line_14746'>  Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read</a>
<a id='line_14747'>  With care, the master pamphlets of the day;</a>
<a id='line_14748'>  Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild</a>
<a id='line_14749'>  Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk</a>
<a id='line_14750'>  And public news; but having never seen                             100</a>
<a id='line_14751'>  A chronicle that might suffice to show</a>
<a id='line_14752'>  Whence the main organs of the public power</a>
<a id='line_14753'>  Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how</a>
<a id='line_14754'>  Accomplished, giving thus unto events</a>
<a id='line_14755'>  A form and body; all things were to me                             105</a>
<a id='line_14756'>  Loose and disjointed, and the affections left</a>
<a id='line_14757'>  Without a vital interest. At that time,</a>
<a id='line_14758'>  Moreover, the first storm was overblown,</a>
<a id='line_14759'>  And the strong hand of outward violence</a>
<a id='line_14760'>  Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear                             110</a>
<a id='line_14761'>  Now in connection with so great a theme</a>
<a id='line_14762'>  To speak (as I must be compelled to do)</a>
<a id='line_14763'>  Of one so unimportant; night by night</a>

<a id='line_14765'>  Whom, in the city, privilege of birth                              115</a>
<a id='line_14766'>  Sequestered from the rest, societies</a>
<a id='line_14767'>  Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;</a>
<a id='line_14768'>  Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse</a>
<a id='line_14769'>  Of good and evil of the time was shunned</a>
<a id='line_14770'>  With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon                  120</a>
<a id='line_14771'>  Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew</a>
<a id='line_14772'>  Into a noisier world, and thus ere long</a>
<a id='line_14773'>  Became a patriot; and my heart was all</a>
<a id='line_14774'>  Given to the people, and my love was theirs.</a>
<a id='line_14775'></a>
<a id='line_14776'>  A band of military Officers,                                       125</a>

<a id='line_14781'>  In age and temper differing, they had yet                          130</a>
<a id='line_14782'>  One spirit ruling in each heart; alike</a>
<a id='line_14783'>  (Save only one, hereafter to be named) [I]</a>
<a id='line_14784'>  Were bent upon undoing what was done:</a>
<a id='line_14785'>  This was their rest and only hope; therewith</a>
<a id='line_14786'>  No fear had they of bad becoming worse,                            135</a>
<a id='line_14787'>  For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,</a>

<a id='line_14789'>  In any thing, save only as the act</a>
<a id='line_14790'>  Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,</a>
<a id='line_14791'>  Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile                          140</a>
<a id='line_14792'>  He had sate lord in many tender hearts;</a>
<a id='line_14793'>  Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:</a>
<a id='line_14794'>  His temper was quite mastered by the times,</a>
<a id='line_14795'>  And they had blighted him, had eaten away</a>
<a id='line_14796'>  The beauty of his person, doing wrong                              145</a>
<a id='line_14797'>  Alike to body and to mind: his port,</a>
<a id='line_14798'>  Which once had been erect and open, now</a>
<a id='line_14799'>  Was stooping and contracted, and a face,</a>
<a id='line_14800'>  Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts</a>
<a id='line_14801'>  Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed,                        150</a>
<a id='line_14802'>  As much as any that was ever seen,</a>
<a id='line_14803'>  A ravage out of season, made by thoughts</a>
<a id='line_14804'>  Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,</a>
<a id='line_14805'>  That from the press of Paris duly brought</a>
<a id='line_14806'>  Its freight of public news, the fever came,                        155</a>
<a id='line_14807'>  A punctual visitant, to shake this man,</a>
<a id='line_14808'>  Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek</a>
<a id='line_14809'>  Into a thousand colours; while he read,</a>
<a id='line_14810'>  Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch</a>
<a id='line_14811'>  Continually, like an uneasy place                                  160</a>
<a id='line_14812'>  In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour</a>
<a id='line_14813'>  Of universal ferment; mildest men</a>
<a id='line_14814'>  Were agitated; and commotions, strife</a>
<a id='line_14815'>  Of passion and opinion, filled the walls</a>
<a id='line_14816'>  Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.                            165</a>
<a id='line_14817'>  The soil of common life, was, at that time,</a>
<a id='line_14818'>  Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,</a>
<a id='line_14819'>  And not then only, "What a mockery this</a>

<a id='line_14826'>  The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain                    175</a>

<a id='line_14832'></a>
<a id='line_14833'>  Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chief</a>

<a id='line_14838'>  This was their undisguised intent, and they</a>
<a id='line_14839'>  Were waiting with the whole of their desires</a>

<a id='line_14955'>  As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,</a>

<a id='line_14963'>  As by some tie invisible, oaths professed                          305</a>

<a id='line_14965'>  As man; and, to the mean and the obscure,</a>
<a id='line_14966'>  And all the homely in their homely works,</a>
<a id='line_14967'>  Transferred a courtesy which had no air</a>
<a id='line_14968'>  Of condescension; but did rather seem                              310</a>
<a id='line_14969'>  A passion and a gallantry, like that</a>
<a id='line_14970'>  Which he, a soldier, in his idler day</a>
<a id='line_14971'>  Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,</a>
<a id='line_14972'>  Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,</a>
<a id='line_14973'>  But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy                            315</a>
<a id='line_14974'>  Diffused around him, while he was intent</a>
<a id='line_14975'>  On works of love or freedom, or revolved</a>
<a id='line_14976'>  Complacently the progress of a cause,</a>
<a id='line_14977'>  Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek</a>
<a id='line_14978'>  And placid, and took nothing from the man                          320</a>
<a id='line_14979'>  That was delightful. Oft in solitude</a>
<a id='line_14980'>  With him did I discourse about the end</a>
<a id='line_14981'>  Of civil government, and its wisest forms;</a>
<a id='line_14982'>  Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,</a>
<a id='line_14983'>  Custom and habit, novelty and change;                              325</a>

<a id='line_14989'>  And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped</a>
<a id='line_14990'>  Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment</a>
<a id='line_14991'>  Than later days allowed; carried about me,</a>
<a id='line_14992'>  With less alloy to its integrity,</a>
<a id='line_14993'>  The experience of past ages, as, through help                      335</a>

<a id='line_14995'>  To youthful minds, by objects over near</a>
<a id='line_14996'>  Not pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled</a>
<a id='line_14997'>  By struggling with the crowd for present ends.</a>
<a id='line_14998'></a>
<a id='line_14999'>    But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find                       340</a>
<a id='line_15000'>  Error without excuse upon the side</a>
<a id='line_15001'>  Of them who strove against us, more delight</a>

<a id='line_15005'>  Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul</a>

<a id='line_15011'>  Where good and evil interchange their names,</a>
<a id='line_15012'>  And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired</a>
<a id='line_15013'>  With vice at home. We added dearest themes--</a>
<a id='line_15014'>  Man and his noble nature, as it is                                 355</a>

<a id='line_15018'>  Bondage, the other to build liberty</a>
<a id='line_15019'>  On firm foundations, making social life,                           360</a>
<a id='line_15020'>  Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,</a>
<a id='line_15021'>  As just in regulation, and as pure</a>

<a id='line_16047'>  Not far from that still ruin all the plain</a>

<a id='line_16057'>  In the familiar language of the day,</a>

<a id='line_16060'>  That he and his supporters all were fallen.                        575</a>
<a id='line_16061'></a>

<a id='line_16065'>  Said I forth-pouring on those open sands</a>
<a id='line_16066'>  A hymn of triumph: "as the morning comes                           580</a>
<a id='line_16067'>  From out the bosom of the night, come ye:</a>
<a id='line_16068'>  Thus far our trust is verified; behold!</a>
<a id='line_16069'>  They who with clumsy desperation brought</a>
<a id='line_16070'>  A river of Blood, and preached that nothing else</a>

<a id='line_16078'>  And how through hardships manifold and long</a>

<a id='line_17126'>  Than those few nooks to which my happy feet</a>
<a id='line_17127'>  Were limited. I had not at that time                               180</a>

<a id='line_17149'>  Too forcibly, too early in my life,</a>
<a id='line_17150'>  Visitings of imaginative power</a>
<a id='line_17151'>  For this to last: I shook the habit off</a>
<a id='line_17152'>  Entirely and for ever, and again                                   205</a>
<a id='line_17153'>  In Nature's presence stood, as now I stand,</a>

<a id='line_17159'>  By false opinion and contentious thought,</a>
<a id='line_17160'>  Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,</a>

<a id='line_17164'>  A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,</a>
<a id='line_17165'>  That penetrates, enables us to mount,</a>

<a id='line_17173'>  From our first childhood. [C] I remember well,                     225</a>
<a id='line_17174'>  That once, while yet my inexperienced hand</a>
<a id='line_17175'>  Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes</a>

<a id='line_17179'>  We had not travelled long, ere some mischance</a>
<a id='line_17180'>  Disjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear</a>
<a id='line_17181'>  Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor</a>
<a id='line_17182'>  I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length</a>
<a id='line_17183'>  Came to a bottom, where in former times                            235</a>
<a id='line_17184'>  A murderer had been hung in iron chains.</a>
<a id='line_17185'>  The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones</a>

<a id='line_17187'>  Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,</a>
<a id='line_17188'>  Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.                  240</a>
<a id='line_17189'>  The monumental letters were inscribed</a>

<a id='line_17194'>  A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,</a>
<a id='line_17195'>  Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:</a>
<a id='line_17196'>  Then, reascending the bare common, saw</a>
<a id='line_17197'>  A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,</a>

<a id='line_17199'>  A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,</a>
<a id='line_17200'>  And seemed with difficult steps to force her way</a>

<a id='line_17207'>  The beacon crowning the lone eminence,</a>
<a id='line_17208'>  The female and her garments vexed and tossed                       260</a>

<a id='line_17210'>  Of early love, the loved one at my side, [E]</a>

<a id='line_17240'>  Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;</a>
<a id='line_17241'>  My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,</a>

<a id='line_17245'>  My expectation, thither I repaired,</a>
<a id='line_17246'>  Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day</a>

<a id='line_17257'>  And I and my three brothers, orphans then,</a>
<a id='line_17258'>  Followed his body to the grave. The event,</a>
<a id='line_17259'>  With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared                      310</a>
<a id='line_17260'>  A chastisement; and when I called to mind</a>

<a id='line_17263'>  With trite reflections of morality,</a>
<a id='line_17264'>  Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low                            315</a>

<a id='line_17266'>  And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,</a>

<a id='line_17268'>  The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,</a>
<a id='line_17269'>  And the bleak music from that old stone wall,                      320</a>
<a id='line_17270'>  The noise of wood and water, and the mist</a>

<a id='line_17273'>  All these were kindred spectacles and sounds</a>
<a id='line_17274'>  To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,                   325</a>
<a id='line_17275'>  As at a fountain; and on winter nights,</a>
<a id='line_17276'>  Down to this very time, when storm and rain</a>

<a id='line_17309'>[Footnote F: The year was evidently 1783, but the locality is difficult</a>
<a id='line_17310'>to determine. It may have been one or other of two places. Wordsworth's</a>
<a id='line_17311'>father died at Penrith, and it was there that the sons went for their</a>
<a id='line_17312'>Christmas holiday. The road from Penrith to Hawkshead was by Kirkstone</a>
<a id='line_17313'>Pass, and Ambleside; and the "led palfreys" sent to take the boys home</a>
<a id='line_17314'>would certainly come through the latter town. Now there are only two</a>
<a id='line_17315'>roads from Ambleside to Hawkshead, which meet at a point about a mile</a>
<a id='line_17316'>north of Hawkshead, called in the Ordnance map "Outgate." The eastern</a>
<a id='line_17317'>road is now chiefly used by carriages, being less hilly and better made</a>
<a id='line_17318'>than the western one. The latter would be quite as convenient as the</a>
<a id='line_17319'>former for horses. If one were to walk out from Hawkshead village to the</a>
<a id='line_17320'>place where the two roads separate at "Outgate," and then ascend the</a>
<a id='line_17321'>ridge between them, he would find several places from which he could</a>
<a id='line_17322'>overlook _both_ roads "far stretched," were the view not now intercepted</a>
<a id='line_17323'>by numerous plantations. (The latter are of comparatively recent</a>
<a id='line_17324'>growth.) Dr. Cradock,--to whom I am indebted for this, and for many</a>
<a id='line_17325'>other suggestions as to localities alluded to by Wordsworth,--thinks</a>
<a id='line_17326'>that</a>
<a id='line_17327'></a>
<a id='line_17328'>  "a point, marked on the map as 'High Crag' between the two roads, and</a>
<a id='line_17329'>  about three-quarters of a mile from their point of divergence, answers</a>
<a id='line_17330'>  the description as well as any other. It may be nearly two miles from</a>
<a id='line_17331'>  Hawkshead, a distance of which an active eager school-boy would think</a>
<a id='line_17332'>  nothing. The 'blasted hawthorn' and the 'naked wall' are probably</a>
<a id='line_17333'>  things of the past as much as the 'single sheep.'"</a>
<a id='line_17334'></a>
<a id='line_17335'>Doubtless this may be the spot,--a green, rocky knoll with a steep face</a>
<a id='line_17336'>to the north, where a quarry is wrought, and with a plantation to the</a>
<a id='line_17337'>east. It commands a view of both roads. The other possible place is a</a>
<a id='line_17338'>crag, not a quarter of a mile from Outgate, a little to the right of the</a>
<a id='line_17339'>place where the two roads divide. A low wall runs up across it to the</a>
<a id='line_17340'>top, dividing a plantation of oak, hazel, and ash, from the firs that</a>
<a id='line_17341'>crown the summit. These firs, which are larch and spruce, seem all of</a>
<a id='line_17342'>this century. The top of the crag may have been bare when Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_17343'>lived at Hawkshead. But at the foot of the path along the dividing wall</a>
<a id='line_17344'>there are a few (probably older) trees; and a solitary walk beneath</a>
<a id='line_17345'>them, at noon or dusk, is almost as suggestive to the imagination, as</a>
<a id='line_17346'>repose under the yews of Borrowdale, listening to "the mountain flood"</a>
<a id='line_17347'>on Glaramara. There one may still hear the bleak music from the old</a>
<a id='line_17348'>stone wall, and "the noise of wood and water," while the loud dry wind</a>
<a id='line_17349'>whistles through the underwood, or moans amid the fir trees of the Crag,</a>
<a id='line_17350'>on the summit of which there is a "blasted hawthorn" tree. It may be</a>
<a id='line_17351'>difficult now to determine the precise spot to which the boy Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_17352'>climbed on that eventful day--afterwards so significant to him, and from</a>
<a id='line_17353'>the events of which, he says, he drank "as at a fountain"--but I think</a>
<a id='line_17354'>it may have been to one or other of these two crags. (See, however, Mr.</a>

<a id='line_17779'>Mr. William Davies writes:</a>
<a id='line_17780'></a>
<a id='line_17781'>  "Is he absolutely right in attributing these powers to the objects of</a>
<a id='line_17782'>  Nature, which are only symbols after all? Is there not a more</a>
<a id='line_17783'>  penetrative and ethereal perceptive power in the human mind, which is</a>
<a id='line_17784'>  able to transfer itself immediately to the spiritual plane,</a>
<a id='line_17785'>  transcending that of visible Nature? Plato saw it; the old Vedantist</a>
<a id='line_17786'>  still more clearly--and what is more--reached it. He arrived at the</a>
<a id='line_17787'>  knowledge and perception of essential Being: though he could neither</a>
<a id='line_17788'>  define nor limit, in a human formula, because it is undefinable and</a>
<a id='line_17789'>  illimitable, but positive and abstract, universally diffused, 'smaller</a>

<a id='line_17791'>  Rest, waiting to be seen, recognised, and known in every heart; not</a>
<a id='line_17792'>  depending on the powers of Nature for enlightenment and instruction,</a>
<a id='line_17793'>  but itself enlightening and instructing: not merely a receptive, but</a>
<a id='line_17794'>  the motive power of Nature; which bestows _itself_ upon Nature, and</a>
<a id='line_17795'>  only receives from it that which it bestows. Is it not, as he says</a>
<a id='line_17796'>  farther on, better 'to see great truths,' even if not so strictly in</a>
<a id='line_17797'>  line and form, 'touch and handle little ones,' to take the highest</a>
<a id='line_17798'>  point of view we can reach, not a lower one? And surely it is a higher</a>
<a id='line_17799'>  thing to rule over and subdue Nature, than to lie ruled and subdued by</a>

<a id='line_17809'>[Footnote C: For a hint in reference to this road, I am indebted to the</a>
<a id='line_17810'>late Dr. Henry Dodgson of Cockermouth. Referring to my suggestion that</a>
<a id='line_17811'>it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk, he wrote (July</a>
<a id='line_17812'>1878),</a>
<a id='line_17813'></a>
<a id='line_17814'>  "I scarcely think that road answers to the description. The hill over</a>
<a id='line_17815'>  which it goes is not naked but well wooded, and has probably been so</a>
<a id='line_17816'>  for many years. Besides, it is not visible from Wordsworth's house,</a>
<a id='line_17817'>  nor from the garden behind it. This garden extends from the house to</a>
<a id='line_17818'>  the river Derwent, from which it is separated by a wall, with a raised</a>
<a id='line_17819'>  terraced walk on the inner side, and nearly on a level with the top. I</a>
<a id='line_17820'>  understand that this terrace was in existence in the poet's time....</a>
<a id='line_17821'>  Its direction is nearly due east and west; and looking eastward from</a>
<a id='line_17822'>  it, there is a hill which bounds the view in that direction, and which</a>
<a id='line_17823'>  fully corresponds to the description in 'The Prelude'. It is from one</a>
<a id='line_17824'>  and a half to two miles distant, of considerable height, is bare and</a>
<a id='line_17825'>  destitute of trees, and has a road going directly over its summit, as</a>
<a id='line_17826'>  seen from the terrace in Wordsworth's garden. This road is now used</a>
<a id='line_17827'>  only as a footpath; but, fifty or sixty years ago it was the highroad</a>
<a id='line_17828'>  to Isel, a hamlet on the Derwent, about three and a half miles from</a>
<a id='line_17829'>  Cockermouth, in the direction of Bassenthwaite Lake. The hill is</a>
<a id='line_17830'>  locally called 'the Hay,' but on the Ordnance map it is marked 'Watch</a>
<a id='line_17831'>  Hill.'"</a>
<a id='line_17832'></a>
<a id='line_17833'>There can be little doubt as to the accuracy of this suggestion. No</a>
<a id='line_17834'>other hill-road is visible from the house or garden at Cockermouth. The</a>
<a id='line_17835'>view from the front of the old mansion is limited by houses, doubtless</a>
<a id='line_17836'>more so now than in last century; but there is no hill towards the</a>
<a id='line_17837'>Lorton Fells on the south or south-east, with a road over it, visible</a>
<a id='line_17838'>from any part of the town. Besides, as this was a very early experience</a>
<a id='line_17839'>of Wordsworth's--it was in "the morn of childhood" that the road was</a>
<a id='line_17840'>"daily present to his sight"--it must have been seen, either from the</a>
<a id='line_17841'>house or from the garden. It is almost certain that he refers to the</a>
<a id='line_17842'>path over the Hay or Watch Hill, which he and his "sister Emmeline"</a>
<a id='line_17843'>could see daily from the high terrace, at the foot of their garden in</a>
<a id='line_17844'>Cockermouth, where they used to "chase the butterfly" and visit the</a>

<a id='line_17850'>  dated 1789, entirely confirms Dr. Dodgson's statement. The road over</a>
<a id='line_17851'>  'Hay Hill' is marked clearly as a carriage road to Isel. The miles are</a>
<a id='line_17852'>  marked on the map. The 'summit' of the hill is 'naked': for the map</a>

<a id='line_17899'></a>
<a id='line_17900'></a>
<a id='line_17901'>  In one of those excursions (may they ne'er</a>
<a id='line_17902'>  Fade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts</a>
<a id='line_17903'>  Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend, [A]</a>
<a id='line_17904'>  I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,</a>
<a id='line_17905'>  And westward took my way, to see the sun                             5</a>
<a id='line_17906'>  Rise from the top of Snowdon. To the door</a>
<a id='line_17907'>  Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base</a>
<a id='line_17908'>  We came, and roused the shepherd who attends</a>
<a id='line_17909'>  The adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide;</a>
<a id='line_17910'>  Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth.                  10</a>
<a id='line_17911'></a>
<a id='line_17912'>    It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,</a>
<a id='line_17913'>  Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog</a>
<a id='line_17914'>  Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky;</a>
<a id='line_17915'>  But, undiscouraged, we began to climb</a>
<a id='line_17916'>  The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,                     15</a>
<a id='line_17917'>  And, after ordinary travellers' talk</a>
<a id='line_17918'>  With our conductor, pensively we sank</a>
<a id='line_17919'>  Each into commerce with his private thoughts:</a>
<a id='line_17920'>  Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself</a>
<a id='line_17921'>  Was nothing either seen or heard that checked                       20</a>
<a id='line_17922'>  Those musings or diverted, save that once</a>
<a id='line_17923'>  The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,</a>
<a id='line_17924'>  Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased</a>
<a id='line_17925'>  His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.</a>
<a id='line_17926'>  This small adventure, for even such it seemed                       25</a>
<a id='line_17927'>  In that wild place and at the dead of night,</a>
<a id='line_17928'>  Being over and forgotten, on we wound</a>
<a id='line_17929'>  In silence as before. With forehead bent</a>
<a id='line_17930'>  Earthward, as if in opposition set</a>
<a id='line_17931'>  Against an enemy, I panted up                                       30</a>
<a id='line_17932'>  With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_17933'>  Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,</a>
<a id='line_17934'>  Ascending at loose distance each from each,</a>
<a id='line_17935'>  And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;</a>
<a id='line_17936'>  When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,                    35</a>
<a id='line_17937'>  And with a step or two seemed brighter still;</a>
<a id='line_17938'>  Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause,</a>
<a id='line_17939'>  For instantly a light upon the turf</a>
<a id='line_17940'>  Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,</a>
<a id='line_17941'>  The Moon hung naked in a firmament                                  40</a>
<a id='line_17942'>  Of azure without cloud, and at my feet</a>
<a id='line_17943'>  Rested a silent sea of hoary mist.</a>
<a id='line_17944'>  A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved</a>
<a id='line_17945'>  All over this still ocean; and beyond,</a>
<a id='line_17946'>  Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,                       45</a>
<a id='line_17947'>  In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,</a>
<a id='line_17948'>  Into the main Atlantic, that appeared</a>
<a id='line_17949'>  To dwindle, and give up his majesty,</a>
<a id='line_17950'>  Usurped upon far as the sight could reach.</a>
<a id='line_17951'>  Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none                        50</a>
<a id='line_17952'>  Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars</a>
<a id='line_17953'>  Had disappeared, or shed a fainter light</a>
<a id='line_17954'>  In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,</a>
<a id='line_17955'>  Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed</a>
<a id='line_17956'>  Upon the billowy ocean, as it lay                                   55</a>
<a id='line_17957'>  All meek and silent, save that through a rift--</a>
<a id='line_17958'>  Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,</a>
<a id='line_17959'>  A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place--</a>
<a id='line_17960'>  Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams</a>
<a id='line_17961'>  Innumerable, roaring with one voice!                                60</a>
<a id='line_17962'>  Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,</a>
<a id='line_17963'>  For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.</a>
<a id='line_17964'></a>
<a id='line_17965'>    When into air had partially dissolved</a>
<a id='line_17966'>  That vision, given to spirits of the night</a>
<a id='line_17967'>  And three chance human wanderers, in calm thought                   65</a>
<a id='line_17968'>  Reflected, it appeared to me the type</a>
<a id='line_17969'>  Of a majestic intellect, its acts</a>
<a id='line_17970'>  And its possessions, what it has and craves,</a>
<a id='line_17971'>  What in itself it is, and would become.</a>
<a id='line_17972'>  There I beheld the emblem of a mind                                 70</a>
<a id='line_17973'>  That feeds upon infinity, that broods</a>
<a id='line_17974'>  Over the dark abyss, [B] intent to hear</a>
<a id='line_17975'>  Its voices issuing forth to silent light</a>
<a id='line_17976'>  In one continuous stream; a mind sustained</a>
<a id='line_17977'>  By recognitions of transcendent power,                              75</a>
<a id='line_17978'>  In sense conducting to ideal form,</a>
<a id='line_17979'>  In soul of more than mortal privilege.</a>
<a id='line_17980'>  One function, above all, of such a mind</a>
<a id='line_17981'>  Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,</a>
<a id='line_17982'>  'Mid circumstances awful and sublime,                               80</a>
<a id='line_17983'>  That mutual domination which she loves</a>
<a id='line_17984'>  To exert upon the face of outward things,</a>

<a id='line_17988'>  And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all</a>
<a id='line_17989'>  Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus</a>
<a id='line_17990'>  To bodily sense exhibits, is the express</a>
<a id='line_17991'>  Resemblance of that glorious faculty</a>
<a id='line_17992'>  That higher minds bear with them as their own.                      90</a>
<a id='line_17993'>  This is the very spirit in which they deal</a>
<a id='line_17994'>  With the whole compass of the universe:</a>

<a id='line_17998'>  Created for them, catch it, or are caught</a>
<a id='line_17999'>  By its inevitable mastery,</a>
<a id='line_18000'>  Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound</a>

<a id='line_18163'>  When Nature, destined to remain so long</a>

<a id='line_18182'>                            With such a theme,                       275</a>
<a id='line_18183'>  Coleridge! with this my argument, of thee</a>

<a id='line_18206'>  Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and there</a>

<a id='line_18222'>  That is collected among woods and fields,</a>
<a id='line_18223'>  Far more: for Nature's secondary grace                             315</a>

<a id='line_18230'>    Finally, and above all, O Friend! (I speak</a>

<a id='line_18240'>  Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,</a>
<a id='line_18241'>  As one of many schoolfellows compelled,</a>
<a id='line_18242'>  In hardy independence, to stand up</a>
<a id='line_18243'>  Amid conflicting interests, and the shock</a>

<a id='line_18245'>  What was not understood, though known to be;</a>

<a id='line_18248'>  Unchecked by innocence too delicate,</a>

<a id='line_18250'>  Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called</a>
<a id='line_18251'>  To take a station among men, the step</a>
<a id='line_18252'>  Was easier, the transition more secure,</a>
<a id='line_18253'>  More profitable also; for, the mind</a>
<a id='line_18254'>  Learns from such timely exercise to keep                           345</a>

<a id='line_18464'></a>
<a id='line_18465'>  "I mentioned Michael Angelo's poetry some time ago; it is the most</a>
<a id='line_18466'>  difficult to construe I ever met with, but just what you would expect</a>
<a id='line_18467'>  from such a man, shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with</a>
<a id='line_18468'>  great things. There is a mistake in the world concerning the Italian</a>
<a id='line_18469'>  language; the poetry of Dante and Michael Angelo proves, that if there</a>
<a id='line_18470'>  be little majesty and strength in Italian verse, the fault is in the</a>
<a id='line_18471'>  authors, and not in the tongue. I can translate, and have translated</a>
<a id='line_18472'>  two books of Ariosto, at the rate, nearly, of one hundred lines a day;</a>
<a id='line_18473'>  but so much meaning has been put by Michael Angelo into so little</a>
<a id='line_18474'>  room, and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself, that I found</a>
<a id='line_18475'>  the difficulty of translating him insurmountable. I attempted, at</a>
<a id='line_18476'>  least, fifteen of the sonnets, but could not anywhere succeed. I have</a>
<a id='line_18477'>  sent you the only one I was able to finish; it is far from being the</a>
<a id='line_18478'>  best, or most characteristic, but the others were too much for me."</a>
<a id='line_18479'></a>
<a id='line_18480'>The last of the three sonnets probably belongs to the year 1804, as it</a>
<a id='line_18481'>is quoted in a letter to Sir George Beaumont, dated Grasmere, August 6.</a>
<a id='line_18482'>The year is not given, but I think it must have been 1804, as he says</a>
<a id='line_18483'>that "within the last month," he had written, "700 additional lines" of</a>

<a id='line_18759'></a>
<a id='line_18760'>(See pp. 188-89, 'The Prelude', book iv.)</a>
<a id='line_18761'></a>
<a id='line_18762'></a>
<a id='line_18763'>Mr. Rawnsley, formerly of Wray Vicarage--now Canon Rawnsley of</a>
<a id='line_18764'>Crosthwaite Vicarage, Keswick--sent me the following letter in reference</a>
<a id='line_18765'>to:</a>
<a id='line_18766'></a>
<a id='line_18767'></a>
<a id='line_18768'>  ... that unruly child of mountain birth,</a>
<a id='line_18769'>  The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed</a>
<a id='line_18770'>  Within our garden, found himself at once,</a>
<a id='line_18771'>  As if by trick insidious and unkind,</a>
<a id='line_18772'>  Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down</a>
<a id='line_18773'>   ...</a>
<a id='line_18774'>  I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,</a>
<a id='line_18775'>   ...</a>
<a id='line_18776'>  'Ha,' quoth I, 'pretty prisoner, are you there!'</a>
<a id='line_18777'></a>
<a id='line_18778'></a>
<a id='line_18779'>  "I was not quite content with Dr. Cradock's identification of this</a>
<a id='line_18780'>  brook, or of the garden; partly because, beyond the present garden</a>
<a id='line_18781'>  square I found, on going up the brook, other garden squares, which</a>
<a id='line_18782'>  were much more likely to have been the garden belonging to Anne</a>
<a id='line_18783'>  Tyson's cottage, and because in these garden plots the stream was not</a>
<a id='line_18784'>  'stripped of his voice,' by the covering of Coniston flags, as is the</a>
<a id='line_18785'>  case lower down towards the market place; and partly because--as you</a>
<a id='line_18786'>  notice--you can both hear and see the stream through the interstices</a>
<a id='line_18787'>  of the flags, and that it can hardly be described (by one who will</a>
<a id='line_18788'>  listen) as stripped of its voice.</a>
<a id='line_18789'></a>
<a id='line_18790'>  At the same time I was bound to admit that in comparing the voice of</a>
<a id='line_18791'>  the stream here in the 'channel paved by man's officious care' with</a>
<a id='line_18792'>  the sound of it up in the fields beyond the vicarage, nearer its</a>
<a id='line_18793'>  birth-place, it certainly might be said to be softer voiced; and as</a>
<a id='line_18794'>  the poet speaks of it as 'that unruly child of mountain birth,' it</a>
<a id='line_18795'>  looks as if he too had realised the difference.</a>
<a id='line_18796'></a>
<a id='line_18797'>  But whilst I thought that the identification of Dr. Cradock and</a>
<a id='line_18798'>  yourself was very happy (in absence of other possibilities), I had not</a>
<a id='line_18799'>  thought that Wordsworth would describe the stream as 'dimpling down,'</a>
<a id='line_18800'>  or address it as a 'pretty prisoner.' A smaller stream seemed</a>
<a id='line_18801'>  necessary.</a>
<a id='line_18802'></a>
<a id='line_18803'>  It was, therefore, not a little curious that, in poking about among</a>
<a id='line_18804'>  the garden plots on the west bank of the stream, fronting (as nearly</a>
<a id='line_18805'>  as I could judge) Anne Tyson's cottage, to seek for remains of the ash</a>
<a id='line_18806'>  tree, in which so often the poet--as he lay awake on summer</a>
<a id='line_18807'>  nights--had watched 'the moon in splendour couched among the leaves,'</a>
<a id='line_18808'>  rocking 'with every impulse of the breeze,' I not only stumbled upon</a>
<a id='line_18809'>  the remains of an ash tree--now a 'pollard'--which is evidently</a>
<a id='line_18810'>  sprung from a larger tree since decayed (and which for all I know may</a>
<a id='line_18811'>  be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself); but also had</a>
<a id='line_18812'>  the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain Isaac Hodgson,</a>
<a id='line_18813'>  who volunteered the following information.</a>
<a id='line_18814'></a>
<a id='line_18815'>  First, that Wordsworth, it was commonly said, had lodged part of his</a>
<a id='line_18816'>  time with one Betty Braithwaite, in the very house called Church Hill</a>
<a id='line_18817'>  House.</a>
<a id='line_18818'></a>
<a id='line_18819'>  She was a widow, and kept a confectionery shop, and 'did a deal of</a>
<a id='line_18820'>  baking,' he believed.</a>
<a id='line_18821'></a>
<a id='line_18822'>  Secondly, that there was a little patch of garden at the back of the</a>
<a id='line_18823'>  house, with a famous spring well--still called Old Betty's Well--in</a>
<a id='line_18824'>  it, and that only a few paces from where I was then standing by the</a>
<a id='line_18825'>  pollard ash.</a>
<a id='line_18826'></a>
<a id='line_18827'>  On jumping over the fence I found myself on the western side of the</a>
<a id='line_18828'>  quaint old Church Hill House, with magnificent views of the whole of</a>
<a id='line_18829'>  the western side of Hawkshead Vale; grassy swell and wooded rises</a>
<a id='line_18830'>  taking the eye up to the moorland ridge between us and Coniston.</a>
<a id='line_18831'></a>
<a id='line_18832'>  'But,' said I, 'what about Betty's Well.' 'Oh,' said my friend,</a>
<a id='line_18833'>  'that's a noted spring, that never freezes, and always runs; we all</a>
<a id='line_18834'>  drink of it, and neighbours send to it. Here it is,' he continued;</a>
<a id='line_18835'>  and, gazing down, I saw a little dripping well of water, lustrous,</a>
<a id='line_18836'>  clear, coming evidently in continuous force from the springs or secret</a>
<a id='line_18837'>  channels up hill, pausing for a moment at the trough, thence falling</a>
<a id='line_18838'>  into a box or 'channel paved by man's officious care,' and in a moment</a>
<a id='line_18839'>  out of sight and soundless, to pursue its way, 'stripped of its</a>
<a id='line_18840'>  voice,' towards the main Town beck, that ran at the north-east border</a>
<a id='line_18841'>  of the garden plot. 'Ha, pretty prisoner,' and the words 'dimple down'</a>
<a id='line_18842'>  came to my mind at once as appropriate. 'Old Betty's Well gave the</a>
<a id='line_18843'>  key-note of the 'famous brook'; and 'boxed within our garden' seemed</a>
<a id='line_18844'>  an appropriate and exact description.</a>
<a id='line_18845'></a>
<a id='line_18846'>  Trace of</a>
<a id='line_18847'>                              'the sunny seat</a>
<a id='line_18848'>    Round the stone table under the dark pine,'</a>
<a id='line_18849'></a>
<a id='line_18850'>  was there none. Not so, however, the Ash tree, the remains of which I</a>
<a id='line_18851'>  have spoken of. From the bedroom of Betty Braithwaite's house the boy</a>
<a id='line_18852'>  could have watched the moon,</a>
<a id='line_18853'></a>
<a id='line_18854'>                             'while to and fro</a>
<a id='line_18855'>    In the dark summit of the waving tree</a>
<a id='line_18856'>    She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.'</a>
<a id='line_18857'></a>
<a id='line_18858'>  'In old times,' said my friend, 'the wall fence ran across the garden,</a>
<a id='line_18859'>  just beyond this spring well, so you see it was but a small spot, was</a>
<a id='line_18860'>  this garden close.' Yes; but the</a>
<a id='line_18861'></a>
<a id='line_18862'>                          'crowd of things</a>
<a id='line_18863'>    About its narrow precincts all beloved,'</a>
<a id='line_18864'></a>
<a id='line_18865'>  were known the better, and loved the more on that account. Certainly,</a>
<a id='line_18866'>  thought I to myself, here is the famous spring; a brook that</a>
<a id='line_18867'>  Wordsworth must have known, and that may have been the centre of</a>
<a id='line_18868'>  memory to him in his description of those early Hawkshead days, with</a>
<a id='line_18869'>  its metaphor of fountain life.</a>
<a id='line_18870'></a>
<a id='line_18871'>  May we not, as we gaze on this little fountain well, in a garden plot</a>
<a id='line_18872'>  at the back of one of the grey huts of this 'one dear vale,' point as</a>
<a id='line_18873'>  with a wand, and say,</a>
<a id='line_18874'></a>
<a id='line_18875'>    'This portion of the river of his mind</a>
<a id='line_18876'>    Came from yon fountain.'</a>
<a id='line_18877'></a>
<a id='line_18878'>  Is it not possible that the old dame whose</a>
<a id='line_18879'></a>
<a id='line_18880'>    'Clear though shallow stream of piety,</a>
<a id='line_18881'>    Ran on the Sabbath days a fresher course,'</a>
<a id='line_18882'></a>
<a id='line_18883'>  was Betty Braithwaite, the aged dame who owned the cottage hard by?"</a>
<a id='line_18884'></a>
<a id='line_18885'></a>
<a id='line_18886'>The following additional extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley's</a>
<a id='line_18887'>(Christmas, 1882) casts light, both on the Hawkshead beck and fountain,</a>
<a id='line_18888'>and on the stone seat in the market square, referred to in the fourth</a>
<a id='line_18889'>book of 'The Prelude'.</a>
<a id='line_18890'></a>
<a id='line_18891'>  "Postlethwaite of the Sun Inn at Hawkshead, has a father aged 82, who</a>
<a id='line_18892'>  can remember that there was a _stone_ bench, not called old Betty's,</a>
<a id='line_18893'>  but Old Jane's Stone, on which she used to spread nuts and cakes for</a>
<a id='line_18894'>  the scholars of the Grammar School, but that it did not stand where</a>
<a id='line_18895'>  the Market Hall now is, and no one ever remembers a stone or</a>
<a id='line_18896'>  stone-bench standing there. This stone or stone-bench stood about</a>
<a id='line_18897'>  opposite the Red Lion inn, in front of the little row of houses that</a>
<a id='line_18898'>  run east and west, just as you pass out of the village in a northerly</a>
<a id='line_18899'>  direction by the Red Lion. This stone or stone-bench is not associated</a>
<a id='line_18900'>  with dark pine trees, but they may have passed away root and branch in</a>
<a id='line_18901'>  an earlier generation.</a>
<a id='line_18902'></a>
<a id='line_18903'>  Next and most interesting, I think, as showing that I was right in the</a>
<a id='line_18904'>  matter of the _famous fountain,_ or spring in the garden, behind Betty</a>
<a id='line_18905'>  Braithwaite's house. There exists in Hawkshead near this house a</a>
<a id='line_18906'>  covered-in place or shed, to which all the village repair for their</a>
<a id='line_18907'>  drinking-water, and always have done so. It is known by the name of</a>
<a id='line_18908'>  the Spout House, and the water--which flows all the year from a</a>
<a id='line_18909'>  longish spout, with an overflow one by its side--comes direct from the</a>
<a id='line_18910'>  little drop well in Betty B.'s garden, after having its voice stripped</a>
<a id='line_18911'>  and boxed therein; and, falling out of the spout into a deep stone</a>
<a id='line_18912'>  basin and culvert, runs through the town to join the Town Beck.</a>
<a id='line_18913'></a>
<a id='line_18914'>  So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this, their familiar fountainhead,</a>
<a id='line_18915'>  that though water is supplied in stand-pipes now from a Reservoir, the</a>
<a id='line_18916'>  folks won't have it, and come here to this spout-house, bucket and jug</a>
<a id='line_18917'>  in hand, morn, noon and night. I have never seen anything so like a</a>
<a id='line_18918'>  continental scene at the gathering at Hawkshead spout-house.</a>
<a id='line_18919'></a>

<a id='line_18944'>If the farm-house where Wordsworth spent the evening before this</a>
<a id='line_18945'>memorable morning walk was either at Elterwater or High Arnside, and the</a>
<a id='line_18946'>homeward pathway led across the ridge of Ironkeld, either by the old</a>
<a id='line_18947'>mountain road (now almost disused), or over the pathless fells, there</a>
<a id='line_18948'>are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in the</a>
<a id='line_18949'>distance. The one is from the heights looking down to the Duddon</a>
<a id='line_18950'>estuary, across the Coniston valley; the other is from a spot nearer</a>
<a id='line_18951'>Hawkshead, where Morecambe Bay is visible. In the former case "the</a>
<a id='line_18952'>meadows and the lower grounds" would be those in Yewdale; in the latter</a>
<a id='line_18953'>case, they would be those between Latterbarrow and Hawkshead; and, on</a>
<a id='line_18954'>either alternative, the "solid mountains" would be those of the Coniston</a>
<a id='line_18955'>group--the Old Man and Wetherlam. It is also possible that the course of</a>
<a id='line_18956'>the walk was over the Latterbarrow fells, or heights of Colthouse; but,</a>
<a id='line_18957'>from the reference to the sunrise "not unseen" from the copse and field,</a>
<a id='line_18958'>through which the "homeward pathway wound," it may be supposed that the</a>
<a id='line_18959'>course was south-east, and therefore not over these fells, when his back</a>
<a id='line_18960'>would have been to the sun. Dr. Cradock's note [Footnote T to book iv]</a>
<a id='line_18961'>to the text (p. 197) sums up all that can "be safely said"; but Mr.</a>
<a id='line_18962'>Rawnsley has supplied me with the following interesting remarks:</a>
<a id='line_18963'></a>
<a id='line_18964'>  "After a careful reading of the passage describing the poet's return</a>
<a id='line_18965'>  from a festal night, spent in some farm-house beyond the hills, I am</a>
<a id='line_18966'>  quite unable to say that the path from High Arnside over the Ironkeld</a>
<a id='line_18967'>  range entirely suits the description. Is it not possible that the lad</a>
<a id='line_18968'>  had school-fellows whose parents lived in Yewdale? If he had, and was</a>
<a id='line_18969'>  returning from the party in one of the Yewdale farms, he would, as he</a>
<a id='line_18970'>  ascended towards Tarn Howes, and faced about south, to gain the main</a>
<a id='line_18971'>  Coniston road, by traversing the meadows between Berwick ground and</a>
<a id='line_18972'>  the top of the Hawkshead and Coniston Hill, command a view of the sea</a>
<a id='line_18973'>  that 'lay laughing at a distance'; and 'near, the solid</a>
<a id='line_18974'>  mountains'--Wetherlam and Coniston Old Man--would shine 'bright as the</a>
<a id='line_18975'>  clouds.' I think this is likely to have been the poet's track, because</a>
<a id='line_18976'>  he speaks of labourers going forth to till the fields; and the Yewdale</a>
<a id='line_18977'>  valley is one that is (at its head) chiefly arable, so that he would</a>
<a id='line_18978'>  be likelier to have gazed on them there than in the vale of Hawkshead</a>
<a id='line_18979'>  itself. One is here, however--as in a former passage, when we fixed on</a>
<a id='line_18980'>  Yewdale as the one described as being a 'cultured vale'--obliged to</a>
<a id='line_18981'>  remember that in Wordsworth's boyhood wheat was grown more extensively</a>
<a id='line_18982'>  than is now the case in these parts. Of course, the Furness Fell,</a>
<a id='line_18983'>  above Colthouse, might have been the scene. It is eminently suited to</a>

<a id='line_19005'>The following is an extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth's to</a>
<a id='line_19006'>Lady Beaumont at Coleorton, dated "14th August," probably in 1808:</a>
<a id='line_19007'></a>
<a id='line_19008'></a>
<a id='line_19009'>  "We reached Cambridge at half-past nine. In our way to the Inn we</a>
<a id='line_19010'>  stopped at the gate of St. John's College to set down one of our</a>
<a id='line_19011'>  passengers. The stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy</a>
<a id='line_19012'>  musing, and I was awe-stricken with the solemnity of the old gateway,</a>
<a id='line_19013'>  and the light from a great distance within streaming along the</a>
<a id='line_19014'>  pavement. When they told me it was the entrance to 'St. John's'</a>
<a id='line_19015'>  College, I was still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight</a>
<a id='line_19016'>  before me, for I thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days</a>
<a id='line_19017'>  passing through that gateway to his home, and I could have believed</a>
<a id='line_19018'>  that I saw him there even then, as I had seen him in the first year of</a>
<a id='line_19019'>  his residence. I met with Mr. Clarkson at the Inn, and was, you may</a>
<a id='line_19020'>  believe, rejoiced to hear his voice at the coach door. We supped</a>
<a id='line_19021'>  together, and immediately after supper I went to bed, and slept well,</a>
<a id='line_19022'>  and at 8 o'clock next morning went to Trinity Chapel. There I stood</a>
<a id='line_19023'>  for many minutes in silence before the statue of Newton, while the</a>
<a id='line_19024'>  organ sounded. I never saw a statue that gave me one hundredth part so</a>
<a id='line_19025'>  much pleasure--but pleasure, that is not the word, it is a sublime</a>
<a id='line_19026'>  sensation--in harmony with sentiments of devotion to the Divine Being,</a>
<a id='line_19027'>  and reverence for the holy places where He is worshipped. We walked in</a>
<a id='line_19028'>  the groves all the morning and visited the Colleges. I sought out a</a>
<a id='line_19029'>  favourite ash tree which my brother speaks of in his poem on his own</a>
<a id='line_19030'>  life--a tree covered with ivy. We dined with a fellow of Peter-House</a>
<a id='line_19031'>  in his rooms, and after dinner I went to King's College Chapel. There,</a>
<a id='line_19032'>  and everywhere else at Cambridge, I was even much more impressed with</a>
<a id='line_19033'>  the effect of the buildings than I had been formerly, and I do believe</a>
<a id='line_19034'>  that this power of receiving an enlarged enjoyment from the sight of</a>
<a id='line_19035'>  buildings is one of the privileges of our later years. I have this</a>

<a id='line_19056'>The following extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley's casts important</a>
<a id='line_19057'>light on a difficult question of localization. Dr. Cradock is inclined</a>
<a id='line_19058'>now to select the Outgate Crag, the second of the four places referred</a>
<a id='line_19059'>to by Mr. Rawnsley. But the first may have been the place, and the</a>
<a id='line_19060'>extract which follows will show how much is yet to be done in this</a>
<a id='line_19061'>matter of localizing poetical allusions.</a>
<a id='line_19062'></a>
<a id='line_19063'>  "As to</a>
<a id='line_19064'></a>
<a id='line_19065'>                                'the crag,</a>
<a id='line_19066'>    That, from the meeting-point of two highways</a>
<a id='line_19067'>    Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched,'</a>
<a id='line_19068'></a>
<a id='line_19069'>  there seems to be no doubt but that we have four competitors for the</a>
<a id='line_19070'>  honour of being the place to which the poet:</a>
<a id='line_19071'></a>
<a id='line_19072'>                  'impatient for the sight</a>
<a id='line_19073'>    Of those led palfreys that should bear them home'</a>

<a id='line_19077'>                       'one Christmas-time,</a>
<a id='line_19078'>    On the glad eve of its dear holidays.'</a>
<a id='line_19079'></a>
<a id='line_19080'>  And unless, as it seems is quite possible, from what one sees in other</a>
<a id='line_19081'>  of Wordsworth's poems, he really stood on one of the crags, and then</a>
<a id='line_19082'>  in his description drew the picture of the landscape at his feet from</a>
<a id='line_19083'>  his memory of what it was as seen from another of the vantage places,</a>
<a id='line_19084'>  we need a high crag, rising gradually or abruptly from the actual</a>
<a id='line_19085'>  meeting-place of two highways, with, if possible at this distance of</a>
<a id='line_19086'>  time, a wall--or traces of it--quite at its summit. (I may mention</a>
<a id='line_19087'>  that the wallers in this country still give two hundred years as the</a>
<a id='line_19088'>  length of time that a dry wall will stand.) We need also traces of an</a>
<a id='line_19089'>  old thorn tree close by. The wall, too, must be so placed on the</a>
<a id='line_19090'>  summit of the crag that, as it faces the direction in which the lad is</a>
<a id='line_19091'>  looking for his palfrey, it shall afford shelter to him against</a>
<a id='line_19092'></a>
<a id='line_19093'>                  'the sleety rain,</a>
<a id='line_19094'>    And all the business of the elements.'</a>
<a id='line_19095'></a>
<a id='line_19096'>  It is evident that the lad would be looking out in a north-easterly</a>
<a id='line_19097'>  direction, i. e. towards the head of Windermere and Ambleside. So that</a>
<a id='line_19098'></a>
<a id='line_19099'>                       'the mist,</a>
<a id='line_19100'>    That on the line of each of those two roads</a>
<a id='line_19101'>    Advanced in such indisputable shapes,'</a>
<a id='line_19102'></a>
<a id='line_19103'>  was urged by a wind that found the poet at his look-out station, glad</a>
<a id='line_19104'>  to have the wall between him and it. Further, there must be in close</a>
<a id='line_19105'>  proximity wood and the sound of rushing water, or the lapping of a</a>
<a id='line_19106'>  lake wind-driven against the marge, for the boy remembers that 'the</a>
<a id='line_19107'>  bleak music from that old stone wall' was mingled with 'the noise of</a>
<a id='line_19108'>  wood and water.' The roads spoken of must be two highways, and must be</a>
<a id='line_19109'>  capable of being seen for some distance; unless, as it is just</a>
<a id='line_19110'>  possible, the epithet 'far-stretched' may be taken as applying not so</a>
<a id='line_19111'>  much to the roads, as to the gradual ascent of the crag from the</a>
<a id='line_19112'>  meeting-place of the two highways.</a>
<a id='line_19113'></a>
<a id='line_19114'>  The scene from the crag must be extended, and half plain half</a>
<a id='line_19115'>  wood-land; at least one gathers as much from the lines:</a>
<a id='line_19116'></a>
<a id='line_19117'>                  'as the mist</a>
<a id='line_19118'>    Gave intermitting prospect of the copse</a>
<a id='line_19119'>    And plain beneath.'</a>
<a id='line_19120'></a>
<a id='line_19121'>  Lastly, it was a day of driving sleet and mist, and this of itself</a>
<a id='line_19122'>  would necessitate that the poet and his brothers should only go to the</a>
<a id='line_19123'>  place close to which the ponies must pass, or from which most plainly</a>
<a id='line_19124'>  the roads were visible.</a>
<a id='line_19125'></a>
<a id='line_19126'>  The boys too were</a>
<a id='line_19127'></a>
<a id='line_19128'>            'feverish, and tired, and restless,'</a>
<a id='line_19129'></a>
<a id='line_19130'>  and a schoolboy, to gain his point on such a day and on such an</a>
<a id='line_19131'>  errand, does not take much account of a mile of country to be</a>
<a id='line_19132'>  travelled over.</a>
<a id='line_19133'></a>
<a id='line_19134'>  So that it is immaterial, I think, to make the distance from Hawkshead</a>
<a id='line_19135'>  of either of the four crags or vantage grounds a factor in decision.</a>
<a id='line_19136'></a>
<a id='line_19137'>  The farther the lads were from home when they met their ponies, the</a>
<a id='line_19138'>  longer ride back they would have, and this to schoolboys is matter of</a>
<a id='line_19139'>  consideration at such times.</a>
<a id='line_19140'></a>
<a id='line_19141'>  Taking then a survey of the ground of choice, we have to decide</a>
<a id='line_19142'>  whether the crag in question is situated at the first division or main</a>
<a id='line_19143'>  split of the road from Ambleside furthest from Hawkshead, or whether</a>
<a id='line_19144'>  at the place where the two roads converge again into one nearer</a>
<a id='line_19145'>  Hawkshead.</a>
<a id='line_19146'></a>
<a id='line_19147'>  Whether, that is, the crag above the Pullwyke quarry, at the junction</a>
<a id='line_19148'>  of the road to Water Barngates and the road to Wray and Outgate is to</a>
<a id='line_19149'>  be selected, about two miles from Hawkshead; or whether we are to fix</a>
<a id='line_19150'>  on the spot you have chosen, at the point about a mile north-east of</a>
<a id='line_19151'>  Hawkshead, 'called in the ordnance map Outgate.'</a>
<a id='line_19152'></a>
<a id='line_19153'>  Of the two I incline to the former, for these reasons. The boys could</a>
<a id='line_19154'>  not be so certain of 'not missing the ponies', at any other place than</a>
<a id='line_19155'>  here at Pullwyke.</a>
<a id='line_19156'></a>
<a id='line_19157'>  The crag exactly answers the poet's description, a rising ground, the</a>
<a id='line_19158'>  meeting-place of two highways. For in the poet's time the old</a>
<a id='line_19159'>  Hawkshead and Outgate road at the Pullwyke corner ran at the very foot</a>
<a id='line_19160'>  of the rising ground (roughly speaking) parallel to and some 60 to 100</a>
<a id='line_19161'>  yards west of the present road from the Pull to Wray.</a>
<a id='line_19162'></a>
<a id='line_19163'>  It is true that no trace of wall is visible at its summit, but the</a>
<a id='line_19164'>  summit has been planted since with trees, and walls are often removed</a>
<a id='line_19165'>  at time of planting.</a>
<a id='line_19166'></a>
<a id='line_19167'>  The poet would have a full view of the main road, down to, and round,</a>
<a id='line_19168'>  the Pullwyke Bay; he would see the branch road from the fork, as it</a>
<a id='line_19169'>  mounted the Water Barngates Hill, to the west, and would see the other</a>
<a id='line_19170'>  road of the fork far-stretched and going south.</a>
<a id='line_19171'></a>
<a id='line_19172'>  He would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land. He</a>
<a id='line_19173'>  might, if the wind were south-easterly, hear the noise of Windermere,</a>
<a id='line_19174'>  sobbing in the Pullwyke Bay, and would without doubt hear also the</a>
<a id='line_19175'>  roar of the Pull Beck water, as it passed down from the Ironkeld</a>
<a id='line_19176'>  slopes on his left towards the lake.</a>
<a id='line_19177'></a>
<a id='line_19178'>  It might be objected that the poem gives us the idea of a crag which,</a>
<a id='line_19179'>  from the Hawkshead side at any rate, would require to be of more</a>
<a id='line_19180'>  difficult ascent than this is, to justify the idea of difficulty as</a>
<a id='line_19181'>  suggested in the lines:</a>
<a id='line_19182'></a>
<a id='line_19183'>                'thither I repaired,</a>
<a id='line_19184'>    Scout-like, and gained the summit;'</a>
<a id='line_19185'></a>
<a id='line_19186'>  but I do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy</a>
<a id='line_19187'>  felt--as he scanned the country with his eyes, on the 'qui vive' at</a>
<a id='line_19188'>  every rise in the ground--the feelings of a scout, who questions</a>
<a id='line_19189'>  constantly the distant prospect.</a>
<a id='line_19190'></a>
<a id='line_19191'>  And certainly the Pullwyke quarry crag rises most steeply from the</a>
<a id='line_19192'>  meeting-point of the two highways.</a>
<a id='line_19193'></a>
<a id='line_19194'>  Next as to the Outgate crag, which you have chosen. I am out of love</a>
<a id='line_19195'>  with it. First, if the lads wanted to make sure of the ponies, they</a>
<a id='line_19196'>  would not have ascended it, but would have stayed just at the</a>
<a id='line_19197'>  Hawkshead side of Outgate, or at the village itself, at the point of</a>
<a id='line_19198'>  convergence of the ways.</a>
<a id='line_19199'></a>
<a id='line_19200'>  Secondly, the crag can hardly be described as rising from the</a>
<a id='line_19201'>  meeting-point of two highways; only one highway passes near it.</a>
<a id='line_19202'></a>
<a id='line_19203'>  The crag is of so curious a formation geologically, that I can't fancy</a>
<a id='line_19204'>  the poet describing his memory of it, without calling it a terraced</a>
<a id='line_19205'>  hill, or an ascent by natural terraces.</a>
<a id='line_19206'></a>
<a id='line_19207'>  Then, again, the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it. The</a>
<a id='line_19208'>  stream not near enough, or rather not of size enough, to be heard.</a>
<a id='line_19209'>  Blelham Tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound, it is</a>
<a id='line_19210'>  true, but the wind we suppose to have been north-east, and the sound</a>
<a id='line_19211'>  of the Blelham Tarn would be much carried away from him.</a>
<a id='line_19212'></a>
<a id='line_19213'>  The present stone wall is not near the summit, and is of comparatively</a>
<a id='line_19214'>  recent date. It is difficult to believe from the slope of the outcrop</a>
<a id='line_19215'>  of rock that a wall could ever have been at the summit.</a>
<a id='line_19216'></a>
<a id='line_19217'>  But there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those</a>
<a id='line_19218'>  extremes, both of which were probably in the mind and memory of the</a>
<a id='line_19219'>  poet as he described the scene, and</a>
<a id='line_19220'></a>
<a id='line_19221'>    'The intermitting prospect of the copse.</a>
<a id='line_19222'>    And plain beneath,'</a>
<a id='line_19223'></a>
<a id='line_19224'>  allowed him by the mist. One of these is the High Crag, about</a>
<a id='line_19225'>  three-quarters of a mile from the divergence or convergence of the two</a>
<a id='line_19226'>  highways, which Dr. Cradock has selected.</a>
<a id='line_19227'></a>
<a id='line_19228'>  There can be no doubt that this is the crag 'par excellence' for a</a>
<a id='line_19229'>  wide and extended look-out over all the country between Outgate and</a>
<a id='line_19230'>  Ambleside. Close at its summit there remain aged thorn trees, but no</a>
<a id='line_19231'>  trace of a wall.</a>
<a id='line_19232'></a>
<a id='line_19233'>  But High Crag can hardly be said to have risen at 'the meeting-point</a>
<a id='line_19234'>  of two highways,' unless we are to understand the epithet</a>
<a id='line_19235'>  'far-stretched' as applying to the south-western slopes or skirts of</a>
<a id='line_19236'>  the hill; and the two highways, the roads between Water Barngates on</a>
<a id='line_19237'>  the west, and the bridle road between Pullwyke and Outgate at their</a>
<a id='line_19238'>  Outgate junction, and this is rather too far a stretch.</a>
<a id='line_19239'></a>
<a id='line_19240'>  It is quite true that if bridle paths can be described as highways,</a>
<a id='line_19241'>  there may be said to be a meeting-point of these close at the</a>
<a id='line_19242'>  north-eastern side of the crag.</a>
<a id='line_19243'></a>
<a id='line_19244'>  But, remembering that the ponies came from Penrith, the driver was not</a>
<a id='line_19245'>  likely to have had any intimate knowledge of these bridle paths;</a>
<a id='line_19246'>  while, at the same time, on that misty day, I much question whether</a>
<a id='line_19247'>  the boys on the look-out at High Crag could have seen ponies creeping</a>
<a id='line_19248'>  along between walled roads at so great a distance as half a mile or</a>
<a id='line_19249'>  more.</a>
<a id='line_19250'></a>
<a id='line_19251'>  And this would seem to have been the problem for them on that day.</a>
<a id='line_19252'></a>
<a id='line_19253'>  I ought in fairness to say that it is not likely that the roads were</a>
<a id='line_19254'>  then (as to-day) walled up high on either side. To-day, even from the</a>
<a id='line_19255'>  summit of High Crag, only the head and ears of a pony could be seen as</a>
<a id='line_19256'>  it passed up the Water Barngates Road; but at the end of last century</a>
<a id='line_19257'>  many of the roads were only partially walled off from the moorlands</a>
<a id='line_19258'>  they passed over in the Lake Country.</a>
<a id='line_19259'></a>
<a id='line_19260'>  Still, as I said, High Crag was a point of vantage that the poet, as a</a>
<a id='line_19261'>  lad, must have often climbed, in this part of the country, if he</a>
<a id='line_19262'>  wanted to indulge in the delights of panoramic scene.</a>
<a id='line_19263'></a>
<a id='line_19264'>  There is a wall some hundred yards from the summit, on the</a>
<a id='line_19265'>  south-westerly flank of High Crag; near this--at a point close by, two</a>
<a id='line_19266'>  large holly trees--the boy might have sheltered himself against the</a>
<a id='line_19267'>  north-eastern wind, and have got a closer and better view of the road</a>
<a id='line_19268'>  between Barngates and Outgate, and Randy Pike and Outgate.</a>
<a id='line_19269'></a>
<a id='line_19270'>  Here, too, he could possibly hear the sound of the stream in the</a>
<a id='line_19271'>  dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet; but I am far from</a>
<a id='line_19272'>  content with this as being the spot the poet watched from.</a>
<a id='line_19273'></a>
<a id='line_19274'>  There is again a fourth possible look-out place, to which you will</a>
<a id='line_19275'>  remember I directed your attention, nearer Randy Pike. The slope,</a>
<a id='line_19276'>  covered with larches, rises up from the Randy Pike Road to a</a>
<a id='line_19277'>  precipitous crag which faces north and east.</a>
<a id='line_19278'></a>
<a id='line_19279'>  From this, a grand view of the country between Randy Pike and Pullwyke</a>
<a id='line_19280'>  is obtained, and if the bridle paths might--as is possible, but</a>
<a id='line_19281'>  unlikely--be called two highways, then this crag could be spoken of as</a>
<a id='line_19282'>  rising from the meeting place of the two highways. For the old</a>
<a id='line_19283'>  Hawkshead Road passed along to the east, within calling distance (say</a>
<a id='line_19284'>  ninety yards), and a bridle road from Pullwyke, now used chiefly by</a>
<a id='line_19285'>  the quarrymen, passed within eighty yards to the west; while it is</a>
<a id='line_19286'>  certain that the brook below, when swollen by winter rains, might be</a>
<a id='line_19287'>  loud enough to be heard from the copse. This crag is known as Coldwell</a>
<a id='line_19288'>  or Caudwell Crag, and is situated about half a mile east-south-east of</a>
<a id='line_19289'>  the High Crag.</a>
<a id='line_19290'></a>
<a id='line_19291'>  It has this much in its favour, that a wall of considerable age crests</a>
<a id='line_19292'>  its summit, and one can whilst sitting down on a rock close behind it</a>
<a id='line_19293'>  be sheltered from the north and east, and yet obtain an extensive view</a>
<a id='line_19294'>  of the subadjacent country. IF it were certain that the ponies when</a>
<a id='line_19295'>  they got to Pullwyke did not go up towards Water Barngates, and so to</a>
<a id='line_19296'>  Hawkshead, then there is no crag in the district which would so</a>
<a id='line_19297'>  thoroughly answer to all the needs of the boys, and to all the points</a>
<a id='line_19298'>  of description the poet has placed on record.</a>
<a id='line_19299'></a>
<a id='line_19300'>  But it is just this IF that makes me decide on the Pullwyke Crag--the</a>
<a id='line_19301'>  one first described--as being the actual spot to which, scout-like,</a>
<a id='line_19302'>  the schoolboys clomb, on that eventful 'eve of their dear holidays;'</a>
<a id='line_19303'>  while, at the same time, it is my firm conviction that Wordsworth--as</a>
<a id='line_19304'>  he painted the memories of that event--had also before his mind's eye</a>
<a id='line_19305'>  the scene as viewed from Coldwell and High Crag."</a>

<a id='line_19549'></a>
<a id='line_19550'></a>
<a id='line_19551'>(See pp. 297 and 302, 'The Prelude', book ix.)</a>
<a id='line_19552'></a>
<a id='line_19553'></a>
<a id='line_19554'>Professor Emile Legouis of Lyons--a thorough student, and a very</a>
<a id='line_19555'>competent expounder, of our modern English Literature--supplied me, some</a>
<a id='line_19556'>years ago, with numerous facts in reference to Wordsworth's friend</a>
<a id='line_19557'>General Beaupuy, and his family, from which I extract the following:</a>
<a id='line_19558'></a>
<a id='line_19559'>  'The Prelude' gives us very little precise information about the</a>
<a id='line_19560'>  republican officer with whom Wordsworth became acquainted in France,</a>
<a id='line_19561'>  and on whom he bestowed more praise than on almost any other of his</a>
<a id='line_19562'>  contemporaries. We only gather the following facts:--That his name was</a>
<a id='line_19563'>  'Beaupuy', that he was quartered at Orleans, with royalist officers,</a>
<a id='line_19564'>  sometime between November 1791 and the spring of 1792, and that</a>
<a id='line_19565'></a>
<a id='line_19566'>    'He perished fighting, _in supreme command_,</a>
<a id='line_19567'>    Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,</a>
<a id='line_19568'>    For liberty, against deluded men,</a>
<a id='line_19569'>    His fellow-countrymen....'</a>
<a id='line_19570'></a>
<a id='line_19571'>  Though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty</a>
<a id='line_19572'>  data, the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in</a>
<a id='line_19573'>  Wordsworth's statement, which, however, can be explained and redressed</a>
<a id='line_19574'>  without much difficulty.</a>
<a id='line_19575'></a>
<a id='line_19576'>  The first inaccuracy is in the spelling of the name, which is</a>
<a id='line_19577'>  'Beaupuy' and not 'Beaupuis'--a slight mistake considering that</a>
<a id='line_19578'>  Wordsworth was a foreigner, and, besides, wrote down his friend's name</a>
<a id='line_19579'>  ten years and perhaps more after losing sight of him. Moreover, the</a>
<a id='line_19580'>  name of the general who, I think, was meant by Wordsworth, I have</a>
<a id='line_19581'>  found spelt 'Beaupuy' in one instance, viz. the signature of a letter</a>
<a id='line_19582'>  of his, as printed in 'Vie et Correspondance de Merlin de Thionville',</a>
<a id='line_19583'>  publiée par Jean Reynaud, Paris, 1860 (2'e partie p. 241).</a>
<a id='line_19584'></a>
<a id='line_19585'>  The spelling of proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays,</a>
<a id='line_19586'>  and this irregularity is not to be wondered at.</a>
<a id='line_19587'></a>
<a id='line_19588'>  The second inaccuracy consists in stating that General Beaupuy died on</a>
<a id='line_19589'>  the banks of the Loire during the Vendean war. Indeed, he was</a>
<a id='line_19590'>  grievously wounded at the Battle of Château-Gonthier, on the 26th of</a>
<a id='line_19591'>  October 1793, and reported as dead. His soldiers thought he had been</a>
<a id='line_19592'>  killed, and the rumour must have spread abroad, as it was recorded by</a>
<a id='line_19593'>  A. Thiers himself in his 'Histoire de la Révolution', and by A.</a>
<a id='line_19594'>  Challemel in his 'Histoire Musée de la République Française'.</a>
<a id='line_19595'></a>
<a id='line_19596'>  It is no wonder that Wordsworth, who was then in England, and could</a>
<a id='line_19597'>  only read imperfect accounts of what took place in France, should have</a>
<a id='line_19598'>  been mistaken too.</a>
<a id='line_19599'></a>
<a id='line_19600'>  No other General Beaupuy is recorded in the history of the Revolution,</a>
<a id='line_19601'>  so far as I have been able to ascertain. The moral character of the</a>
<a id='line_19602'>  officer, whose life I shall relate, answers to Wordsworth's</a>
<a id='line_19603'>  description, and is worthy of his high estimate.</a>
<a id='line_19604'></a>
<a id='line_19605'>  Armand Michel de Bachelier, Chevalier de Beaupuy, was born at</a>
<a id='line_19606'>  Mussidan, in Perigord, on the 15th of July 1757. He belonged to a</a>
<a id='line_19607'>  noble family, less proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had</a>
<a id='line_19608'>  shed for France on many battlefields. On his mother's side (Mlle. de</a>
<a id='line_19609'>  Villars), he reckoned Montaigne, the celebrated essayist, among his</a>
<a id='line_19610'>  ancestors. His parents having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the</a>
<a id='line_19611'>  time, educated him according to their principles.</a>
<a id='line_19612'></a>
<a id='line_19613'>  He had four brothers, who were all destined to turn republicans and do</a>
<a id='line_19614'>  good service to the new cause, though their interest certainly lay in</a>
<a id='line_19615'>  the opposite direction.</a>
<a id='line_19616'></a>
<a id='line_19617'>  ...</a>
<a id='line_19618'></a>
<a id='line_19619'>  He was made sub-lieutenant in the regiment of Bassigny (33rd division</a>
<a id='line_19620'>  of foot) on the 2nd of March 1773, and lieutenant of grenadiers on the</a>
<a id='line_19621'>  1st of October of the same year.</a>
<a id='line_19622'></a>
<a id='line_19623'>  In 1791 he was first lieutenant in the same regiment. Having sided</a>
<a id='line_19624'>  with the Revolution, he was appointed commander of a battalion of</a>
<a id='line_19625'>  national volunteers in the department of Dordogne. I have not found</a>
<a id='line_19626'>  the exact date of this appointment, but it must have taken place</a>
<a id='line_19627'>  immediately after his stay at Orléans with Wordsworth.</a>
<a id='line_19628'></a>
<a id='line_19629'>  I have found no further mention of his name till September 1792, when</a>
<a id='line_19630'>  he is known to have served in the "Armée du Rhin," under General</a>
<a id='line_19631'>  Custine, and contributed to the taking of Spire.</a>
<a id='line_19632'></a>
<a id='line_19633'>  He took an important part in the taking of Worms, 4th October; of</a>
<a id='line_19634'>  Mayence (Maenz) 21st October. He was among the garrison of Mayence</a>
<a id='line_19635'>  when this place was besieged by the Prussians, and obliged to</a>
<a id='line_19636'>  capitulate after a long and famous siege (from 6th April 1793 to 22nd</a>
<a id='line_19637'>  July 1793). [A]</a>
<a id='line_19638'></a>
<a id='line_19639'>  During the siege he wrote a journal of all the operations.</a>
<a id='line_19640'>  Unfortunately, this journal is very short, and purely military. It has</a>
<a id='line_19641'>  been handed down to us, and is found in the Bibliothèque Nationale of</a>
<a id='line_19642'>  Paris in the 'Papiers de Merlin de Thionville', n. acq. fr. Nos.</a>
<a id='line_19643'>  244-252, 8 vol. in-8°. Beaupuy's journal is in the 3rd volume, fol.</a>
<a id='line_19644'>  213-228.</a>
<a id='line_19645'></a>
<a id='line_19646'>  ...</a>
<a id='line_19647'></a>
<a id='line_19648'>  In the Vendean war, the "Mayençais," or soldiers returned from</a>
<a id='line_19649'>  Mayence, made themselves conspicuous, and bore almost all the brunt of</a>
<a id='line_19650'>  the campaign. But none of them distinguished himself more than</a>
<a id='line_19651'>  Beaupuy, then a General of Brigade.</a>
<a id='line_19652'></a>
<a id='line_19653'>  The Mayençais arrived in Vendée at the end of August or beginning of</a>
<a id='line_19654'>  September 1793. To Beaupuy's skill the victory of Chollet (Oct. 17,</a>
<a id='line_19655'>  1793) is attributed by Jomini. In this battle he fought hand to hand</a>
<a id='line_19656'>  with and overcame a Vendean cavalier. He himself had three horses</a>
<a id='line_19657'>  killed, and had a very narrow escape. On the battlefield he was made</a>
<a id='line_19658'>  'general of division' by the "Represéntants du peuple." It was after</a>
<a id='line_19659'>  Chollet that the Vendeans made the memorable crossing of the Loire at</a>
<a id='line_19660'>  St. Florent.</a>
<a id='line_19661'></a>
<a id='line_19662'>  At Laval and Château-Gonthier (Oct. 26) a terrible defeat was</a>
<a id='line_19663'>  inflicted on the Republicans, owing to the incapacity of their</a>
<a id='line_19664'>  commander-in-chief, Léchelle. The whole corps commanded by General</a>
<a id='line_19665'>  Beaupuy was crushed by a terrible fire, He himself, after withstanding</a>
<a id='line_19666'>  for two or three hours with 2000 or 3000 men all the attacks of the</a>
<a id='line_19667'>  royalists, was disabled by a shot, and fell, crying out, "'Laissez-moi</a>
<a id='line_19668'>  là, et portez à mes grenadiers ma chemise sanglante'." His soldiers</a>
<a id='line_19669'>  thought he was dead, and then the error was spread, which was repeated</a>
<a id='line_19670'>  by Wordsworth, Thiers, and Challamel. Wordsworth's mistake is so far</a>
<a id='line_19671'>  interesting, as it seems to prove that very little or no</a>
<a id='line_19672'>  correspondence passed between the two friends after they had parted.</a>
<a id='line_19673'>  Beaupuy, moreover, had too much work upon his hands to give much of</a>
<a id='line_19674'>  his time to letter-writing.</a>
<a id='line_19675'></a>
<a id='line_19676'>  Though severely wounded, Beaupuy lived on, and less than six weeks</a>
<a id='line_19677'>  after the battle of Château-Gonthier, he was seen on the ramparts of</a>
<a id='line_19678'>  Angers, where he required himself to be carried to animate his</a>
<a id='line_19679'>  soldiers and head the defenders of the place, from which the Vendeans</a>
<a id='line_19680'>  were driven after a severe contest (Dec. 5 and 6).</a>
<a id='line_19681'></a>
<a id='line_19682'>  On the 22nd of December 1793 he shared in the victory of Savenay with</a>
<a id='line_19683'>  his celebrated friends, Marceau, Kleber, and Westermann. After this</a>
<a id='line_19684'>  battle, which put an end to the great Vendean war, he wrote the</a>
<a id='line_19685'>  following letter to his friend Merlin de Thionville, the celebrated</a>
<a id='line_19686'>  "représentant du peuple."</a>
<a id='line_19687'></a>
<a id='line_19688'>    "SAVENAY, le 4 Nivôse au 2'e (25 Dec. 73).</a>

<a id='line_19724'>    LE GÉNERAL DE BRIGADE BEAUPUY.</a>
<a id='line_19725'></a>
<a id='line_19726'></a>
<a id='line_19727'>  I think I can recognize in this letter some traits of Beaupuy's</a>
<a id='line_19728'>  character as pointed out by Wordsworth, not excepting the</a>
<a id='line_19729'>  half-suppressed criticism:</a>
<a id='line_19730'></a>
<a id='line_19731'>      '... somewhat vain he was,</a>
<a id='line_19732'>    Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,</a>
<a id='line_19733'>    But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy</a>
<a id='line_19734'>    Diffused around him ...'</a>
<a id='line_19735'></a>
<a id='line_19736'>  Passing over numerous military incidents, on the 26th of June 1796</a>
<a id='line_19737'>  Beaupuy received seven or eight sabre-cuts at Jorich-Wildstadt. But on</a>
<a id='line_19738'>  the 8th of July he was already back at his post.</a>
<a id='line_19739'></a>
<a id='line_19740'>  He again greatly distinguished himself on the 1st of September 1796 at</a>
<a id='line_19741'>  Greisenfeld and Langenbruck, where the victory of the French was owing</a>
<a id='line_19742'>  to a timely attack made by Desaix and himself.</a>
<a id='line_19743'></a>
<a id='line_19744'>  He was one of the generals under Moreau when the latter achieved his</a>
<a id='line_19745'>  well-known retreat through the Black Forest, begun on the 15th of</a>
<a id='line_19746'>  September 1796, and during which many battles were fought. In one of</a>
<a id='line_19747'>  the actions on the banks of the Elz, Beaupuy was killed by a</a>
<a id='line_19748'>  cannon-ball, while opposing General Latour on the heights of</a>
<a id='line_19749'>  Malterdingen. His soldiers, who loved him passionately, fought</a>
<a id='line_19750'>  desperately to avenge his death (Oct. 19, 1796).</a>
<a id='line_19751'></a>
<a id='line_19752'>  One of Beaupuy's colleagues, General Duhem, in his account of the</a>
<a id='line_19753'>  battle to the Government, thus expressed himself on General Beaupuy:</a>
<a id='line_19754'></a>
<a id='line_19755'>    "Ecrivains patriotes, orateurs chaleureux, je vous propose un noble</a>
<a id='line_19756'>    sujet, l'éloge du Géneral Beaupuy, de Beaupuy, le Nestor et</a>
<a id='line_19757'>    l'Achille de notre armée. Vous n'avez pas de récherches à faire;</a>
<a id='line_19758'>    interrogez le premier soldat de l'armée du Rhin-et-Moselle, ses</a>
<a id='line_19759'>    larmes exciteront les vôtres. Ecrivez alors ce que est vous en dira,</a>
<a id='line_19760'>    et vous peindrez le Bayard de la République Française."</a>
<a id='line_19761'></a>
<a id='line_19762'>  Such bombastic style was then common, but what we have seen of Beaupuy</a>
<a id='line_19763'>  in this sketch shows that he had through his career united Nestor's</a>
<a id='line_19764'>  prudence [B] with Achilles' bodily courage and Bayard's chivalric</a>
<a id='line_19765'>  spirit,--to use the language of the time.</a>
<a id='line_19766'></a>
<a id='line_19767'>  General Moreau had Beaupuy's remains transported to Brisach, where a</a>
<a id='line_19768'>  monument was erected to his memory in 1802, after the peace of</a>
<a id='line_19769'>  Lunéville.</a>
<a id='line_19770'></a>
<a id='line_19771'>  In short, Beaupuy seems to have always remained worthy of the high</a>
<a id='line_19772'>  praise bestowed on him by Wordsworth. His name is to be remembered</a>
<a id='line_19773'>  along with those of the unspotted generals of the first years of the</a>
<a id='line_19774'>  Revolution--Hoche, Marceau, etc.--before the craving for conquest had</a>
<a id='line_19775'>  developed, and the love of liberty yielded to a fond admiration of</a>
<a id='line_19776'>  Bonaparte as it did in the case of Kleber, Desaix, and so many others.</a>
<a id='line_19777'>  [C]</a>
<a id='line_19778'></a>
<a id='line_19779'>  N. B.--The great influence which Beaupuy exercised at that time on</a>
<a id='line_19780'>  Wordsworth will be easily understood, if we take into account not only</a>
