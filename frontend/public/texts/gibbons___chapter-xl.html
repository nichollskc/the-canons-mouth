<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>      The emperor Justinian was born 1 near the ruins of Sardica, (the</a>
<a id='line_11'>      modern Sophia,) of an obscure race 2 of Barbarians, 3 the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      inhabitants of a wild and desolate country, to which the names of</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Dardania, of Dacia, and of Bulgaria, have been successively</a>
<a id='line_14'>      applied. His elevation was prepared by the adventurous spirit of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      his uncle Justin, who, with two other peasants of the same</a>
<a id='line_16'>      village, deserted, for the profession of arms, the more useful</a>
<a id='line_17'>      employment of husbandmen or shepherds. 4 On foot, with a scanty</a>
<a id='line_18'>      provision of biscuit in their knapsacks, the three youths</a>
<a id='line_19'>      followed the high road of Constantinople, and were soon enrolled,</a>
<a id='line_20'>      for their strength and stature, among the guards of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Leo. Under the two succeeding reigns, the fortunate peasant</a>
<a id='line_22'>      emerged to wealth and honors; and his escape from some dangers</a>
<a id='line_23'>      which threatened his life was afterwards ascribed to the guardian</a>
<a id='line_24'>      angel who watches over the fate of kings. His long and laudable</a>
<a id='line_25'>      service in the Isaurian and Persian wars would not have preserved</a>
<a id='line_26'>      from oblivion the name of Justin; yet they might warrant the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      military promotion, which in the course of fifty years he</a>
<a id='line_28'>      gradually obtained; the rank of tribune, of count, and of</a>
<a id='line_29'>      general; the dignity of senator, and the command of the guards,</a>
<a id='line_30'>      who obeyed him as their chief, at the important crisis when the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      emperor Anastasius was removed from the world. The powerful</a>
<a id='line_32'>      kinsmen whom he had raised and enriched were excluded from the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      throne; and the eunuch Amantius, who reigned in the palace, had</a>
<a id='line_34'>      secretly resolved to fix the diadem on the head of the most</a>
<a id='line_35'>      obsequious of his creatures. A liberal donative, to conciliate</a>
<a id='line_36'>      the suffrage of the guards, was intrusted for that purpose in the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      hands of their commander. But these weighty arguments were</a>
<a id='line_38'>      treacherously employed by Justin in his own favor; and as no</a>
<a id='line_39'>      competitor presumed to appear, the Dacian peasant was invested</a>
<a id='line_40'>      with the purple by the unanimous consent of the soldiers, who</a>
<a id='line_41'>      knew him to be brave and gentle, of the clergy and people, who</a>
<a id='line_42'>      believed him to be orthodox, and of the provincials, who yielded</a>
<a id='line_43'>      a blind and implicit submission to the will of the capital. The</a>
<a id='line_44'>      elder Justin, as he is distinguished from another emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      same family and name, ascended the Byzantine throne at the age of</a>
<a id='line_46'>      sixty-eight years; and, had he been left to his own guidance,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      every moment of a nine years’ reign must have exposed to his</a>
<a id='line_48'>      subjects the impropriety of their choice. His ignorance was</a>
<a id='line_49'>      similar to that of Theodoric; and it is remarkable that in an age</a>
<a id='line_50'>      not destitute of learning, two contemporary monarchs had never</a>
<a id='line_51'>      been instructed in the knowledge of the alphabet. 411 But the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      genius of Justin was far inferior to that of the Gothic king: the</a>
<a id='line_53'>      experience of a soldier had not qualified him for the government</a>
<a id='line_54'>      of an empire; and though personally brave, the consciousness of</a>
<a id='line_55'>      his own weakness was naturally attended with doubt, distrust, and</a>
<a id='line_56'>      political apprehension. But the official business of the state</a>
<a id='line_57'>      was diligently and faithfully transacted by the quaestor Proclus;</a>
<a id='line_58'>      5 and the aged emperor adopted the talents and ambition of his</a>
<a id='line_59'>      nephew Justinian, an aspiring youth, whom his uncle had drawn</a>
<a id='line_60'>      from the rustic solitude of Dacia, and educated at</a>
<a id='line_61'>      Constantinople, as the heir of his private fortune, and at length</a>
<a id='line_62'>      of the Eastern empire.</a>

<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>      4 (return) [ See the anecdotes of Procopius, (c. 6,) with the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      notes of N. Alemannus. The satirist would not have sunk, in the</a>
<a id='line_82'>      vague and decent appellation of Zonaras. Yet why are those names</a>
<a id='line_83'>      disgraceful?—and what German baron would not be proud to descend</a>

<a id='line_98'>      c. 11.) The quaestor Proclus was the friend of Justinian, and the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      enemy of every other adoption.]</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>      Since the eunuch Amantius had been defrauded of his money, it</a>
<a id='line_102'>      became necessary to deprive him of his life. The task was easily</a>
<a id='line_103'>      accomplished by the charge of a real or fictitious conspiracy;</a>
<a id='line_104'>      and the judges were informed, as an accumulation of guilt, that</a>
<a id='line_105'>      he was secretly addicted to the Manichaean heresy. 6 Amantius</a>
<a id='line_106'>      lost his head; three of his companions, the first domestics of</a>
<a id='line_107'>      the palace, were punished either with death or exile; and their</a>
<a id='line_108'>      unfortunate candidate for the purple was cast into a deep</a>
<a id='line_109'>      dungeon, overwhelmed with stones, and ignominiously thrown,</a>
<a id='line_110'>      without burial, into the sea. The ruin of Vitalian was a work of</a>
<a id='line_111'>      more difficulty and danger. That Gothic chief had rendered</a>
<a id='line_112'>      himself popular by the civil war which he boldly waged against</a>
<a id='line_113'>      Anastasius for the defence of the orthodox faith, and after the</a>
<a id='line_114'>      conclusion of an advantageous treaty, he still remained in the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      neighborhood of Constantinople at the head of a formidable and</a>
<a id='line_116'>      victorious army of Barbarians. By the frail security of oaths, he</a>
<a id='line_117'>      was tempted to relinquish this advantageous situation, and to</a>
<a id='line_118'>      trust his person within the walls of a city, whose inhabitants,</a>
<a id='line_119'>      particularly the blue faction, were artfully incensed against him</a>
<a id='line_120'>      by the remembrance even of his pious hostilities. The emperor and</a>
<a id='line_121'>      his nephew embraced him as the faithful and worthy champion of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      the church and state; and gratefully adorned their favorite with</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the titles of consul and general; but in the seventh month of his</a>
<a id='line_124'>      consulship, Vitalian was stabbed with seventeen wounds at the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      royal banquet; 7 and Justinian, who inherited the spoil, was</a>
<a id='line_126'>      accused as the assassin of a spiritual brother, to whom he had</a>
<a id='line_127'>      recently pledged his faith in the participation of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_128'>      mysteries. 8 After the fall of his rival, he was promoted,</a>
<a id='line_129'>      without any claim of military service, to the office of</a>
<a id='line_130'>      master-general of the Eastern armies, whom it was his duty to</a>
<a id='line_131'>      lead into the field against the public enemy. But, in the pursuit</a>
<a id='line_132'>      of fame, Justinian might have lost his present dominion over the</a>
<a id='line_133'>      age and weakness of his uncle; and instead of acquiring by</a>
<a id='line_134'>      Scythian or Persian trophies the applause of his countrymen, 9</a>
<a id='line_135'>      the prudent warrior solicited their favor in the churches, the</a>
<a id='line_136'>      circus, and the senate, of Constantinople. The Catholics were</a>
<a id='line_137'>      attached to the nephew of Justin, who, between the Nestorian and</a>
<a id='line_138'>      Eutychian heresies, trod the narrow path of inflexible and</a>
<a id='line_139'>      intolerant orthodoxy. 10 In the first days of the new reign, he</a>
<a id='line_140'>      prompted and gratified the popular enthusiasm against the memory</a>
<a id='line_141'>      of the deceased emperor. After a schism of thirty-four years, he</a>
<a id='line_142'>      reconciled the proud and angry spirit of the Roman pontiff, and</a>
<a id='line_143'>      spread among the Latins a favorable report of his pious respect</a>
<a id='line_144'>      for the apostolic see. The thrones of the East were filled with</a>
<a id='line_145'>      Catholic bishops, devoted to his interest, the clergy and the</a>
<a id='line_146'>      monks were gained by his liberality, and the people were taught</a>
<a id='line_147'>      to pray for their future sovereign, the hope and pillar of the</a>
<a id='line_148'>      true religion. The magnificence of Justinian was displayed in the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      superior pomp of his public spectacles, an object not less sacred</a>
<a id='line_150'>      and important in the eyes of the multitude than the creed of Nice</a>
<a id='line_151'>      or Chalcedon: the expense of his consulship was esteemed at two</a>
<a id='line_152'>      hundred and twenty-eight thousand pieces of gold; twenty lions,</a>
<a id='line_153'>      and thirty leopards, were produced at the same time in the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      amphitheatre, and a numerous train of horses, with their rich</a>
<a id='line_155'>      trappings, was bestowed as an extraordinary gift on the</a>
<a id='line_156'>      victorious charioteers of the circus. While he indulged the</a>
<a id='line_157'>      people of Constantinople, and received the addresses of foreign</a>
<a id='line_158'>      kings, the nephew of Justin assiduously cultivated the friendship</a>
<a id='line_159'>      of the senate. That venerable name seemed to qualify its members</a>
<a id='line_160'>      to declare the sense of the nation, and to regulate the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      succession of the Imperial throne: the feeble Anastasius had</a>
<a id='line_162'>      permitted the vigor of government to degenerate into the form or</a>
<a id='line_163'>      substance of an aristocracy; and the military officers who had</a>
<a id='line_164'>      obtained the senatorial rank were followed by their domestic</a>
<a id='line_165'>      guards, a band of veterans, whose arms or acclamations might fix</a>
<a id='line_166'>      in a tumultuous moment the diadem of the East. The treasures of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      the state were lavished to procure the voices of the senators,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      and their unanimous wish, that he would be pleased to adopt</a>
<a id='line_169'>      Justinian for his colleague, was communicated to the emperor. But</a>
<a id='line_170'>      this request, which too clearly admonished him of his approaching</a>
<a id='line_171'>      end, was unwelcome to the jealous temper of an aged monarch,</a>
<a id='line_172'>      desirous to retain the power which he was incapable of</a>
<a id='line_173'>      exercising; and Justin, holding his purple with both his hands,</a>
<a id='line_174'>      advised them to prefer, since an election was so profitable, some</a>
<a id='line_175'>      older candidate. Not withstanding this reproach, the senate</a>
<a id='line_176'>      proceeded to decorate Justinian with the royal epithet of</a>
<a id='line_177'>      nobilissimus; and their decree was ratified by the affection or</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the fears of his uncle. After some time the languor of mind and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      body, to which he was reduced by an incurable wound in his thigh,</a>
<a id='line_180'>      indispensably required the aid of a guardian. He summoned the</a>
<a id='line_181'>      patriarch and senators; and in their presence solemnly placed the</a>
<a id='line_182'>      diadem on the head of his nephew, who was conducted from the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      palace to the circus, and saluted by the loud and joyful applause</a>
<a id='line_184'>      of the people. The life of Justin was prolonged about four</a>
<a id='line_185'>      months; but from the instant of this ceremony, he was considered</a>
<a id='line_186'>      as dead to the empire, which acknowledged Justinian, in the</a>
<a id='line_187'>      forty-fifth year of his age, for the lawful sovereign of the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      East. 11</a>

<a id='line_249'>      frequently inserts, contain a rich fund of political knowledge;</a>
<a id='line_250'>      and the historian, excited by the generous ambition of pleasing</a>
<a id='line_251'>      and instructing posterity, appears to disdain the prejudices of</a>
<a id='line_252'>      the people, and the flattery of courts. The writings of Procopius</a>
<a id='line_253'>      14 were read and applauded by his contemporaries: 15 but,</a>
<a id='line_254'>      although he respectfully laid them at the foot of the throne, the</a>
<a id='line_255'>      pride of Justinian must have been wounded by the praise of a</a>
<a id='line_256'>      hero, who perpetually eclipses the glory of his inactive</a>
<a id='line_257'>      sovereign. The conscious dignity of independence was subdued by</a>
<a id='line_258'>      the hopes and fears of a slave; and the secretary of Belisarius</a>
<a id='line_259'>      labored for pardon and reward in the six books of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_260'>      edifices. He had dexterously chosen a subject of apparent</a>
<a id='line_261'>      splendor, in which he could loudly celebrate the genius, the</a>
<a id='line_262'>      magnificence, and the piety of a prince, who, both as a conqueror</a>
<a id='line_263'>      and legislator, had surpassed the puerile virtues of Themistocles</a>
<a id='line_264'>      and Cyrus. 16 Disappointment might urge the flatterer to secret</a>
<a id='line_265'>      revenge; and the first glance of favor might again tempt him to</a>
<a id='line_266'>      suspend and suppress a libel, 17 in which the Roman Cyrus is</a>
<a id='line_267'>      degraded into an odious and contemptible tyrant, in which both</a>
<a id='line_268'>      the emperor and his consort Theodora are seriously represented as</a>
<a id='line_269'>      two daemons, who had assumed a human form for the destruction of</a>
<a id='line_270'>      mankind. 18 Such base inconsistency must doubtless sully the</a>
<a id='line_271'>      reputation, and detract from the credit, of Procopius: yet, after</a>
<a id='line_272'>      the venom of his malignity has been suffered to exhale, the</a>
<a id='line_273'>      residue of the anecdotes, even the most disgraceful facts, some</a>
<a id='line_274'>      of which had been tenderly hinted in his public history, are</a>
<a id='line_275'>      established by their internal evidence, or the authentic</a>
<a id='line_276'>      monuments of the times. 19 1911 From these various materials, I</a>
<a id='line_277'>      shall now proceed to describe the reign of Justinian, which will</a>
<a id='line_278'>      deserve and occupy an ample space. The present chapter will</a>
<a id='line_279'>      explain the elevation and character of Theodora, the factions of</a>
<a id='line_280'>      the circus, and the peaceful administration of the sovereign of</a>
<a id='line_281'>      the East. In the three succeeding chapters, I shall relate the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      wars of Justinian, which achieved the conquest of Africa and</a>
<a id='line_283'>      Italy; and I shall follow the victories of Belisarius and Narses,</a>
<a id='line_284'>      without disguising the vanity of their triumphs, or the hostile</a>
<a id='line_285'>      virtue of the Persian and Gothic heroes. The series of this and</a>
<a id='line_286'>      the following volume will embrace the jurisprudence and theology</a>
<a id='line_287'>      of the emperor; the controversies and sects which still divide</a>
<a id='line_288'>      the Oriental church; the reformation of the Roman law which is</a>

<a id='line_375'>      on this viratent libel—M.]</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>      I. In the exercise of supreme power, the first act of Justinian</a>
<a id='line_378'>      was to divide it with the woman whom he loved, the famous</a>
<a id='line_379'>      Theodora, 20 whose strange elevation cannot be applauded as the</a>
<a id='line_380'>      triumph of female virtue. Under the reign of Anastasius, the care</a>
<a id='line_381'>      of the wild beasts maintained by the green faction at</a>
<a id='line_382'>      Constantinople was intrusted to Acacius, a native of the Isle of</a>
<a id='line_383'>      Cyprus, who, from his employment, was surnamed the master of the</a>
<a id='line_384'>      bears. This honorable office was given after his death to another</a>
<a id='line_385'>      candidate, notwithstanding the diligence of his widow, who had</a>
<a id='line_386'>      already provided a husband and a successor. Acacius had left</a>
<a id='line_387'>      three daughters, Comito, 21 Theodora, and Anastasia, the eldest</a>
<a id='line_388'>      of whom did not then exceed the age of seven years. On a solemn</a>
<a id='line_389'>      festival, these helpless orphans were sent by their distressed</a>
<a id='line_390'>      and indignant mother, in the garb of suppliants, into the midst</a>
<a id='line_391'>      of the theatre: the green faction received them with contempt,</a>
<a id='line_392'>      the blues with compassion; and this difference, which sunk deep</a>
<a id='line_393'>      into the mind of Theodora, was felt long afterwards in the</a>
<a id='line_394'>      administration of the empire. As they improved in age and beauty,</a>
<a id='line_395'>      the three sisters were successively devoted to the public and</a>
<a id='line_396'>      private pleasures of the Byzantine people: and Theodora, after</a>
<a id='line_397'>      following Comito on the stage, in the dress of a slave, with a</a>
<a id='line_398'>      stool on her head, was at length permitted to exercise her</a>
<a id='line_399'>      independent talents. She neither danced, nor sung, nor played on</a>
<a id='line_400'>      the flute; her skill was confined to the pantomime arts; she</a>
<a id='line_401'>      excelled in buffoon characters, and as often as the comedian</a>
<a id='line_402'>      swelled her cheeks, and complained with a ridiculous tone and</a>
<a id='line_403'>      gesture of the blows that were inflicted, the whole theatre of</a>
<a id='line_404'>      Constantinople resounded with laughter and applause. The beauty</a>
<a id='line_405'>      of Theodora 22 was the subject of more flattering praise, and the</a>
<a id='line_406'>      source of more exquisite delight. Her features were delicate and</a>
<a id='line_407'>      regular; her complexion, though somewhat pale, was tinged with a</a>
<a id='line_408'>      natural color; every sensation was instantly expressed by the</a>
<a id='line_409'>      vivacity of her eyes; her easy motions displayed the graces of a</a>
<a id='line_410'>      small but elegant figure; and either love or adulation might</a>
<a id='line_411'>      proclaim, that painting and poetry were incapable of delineating</a>
<a id='line_412'>      the matchless excellence of her form. But this form was degraded</a>
<a id='line_413'>      by the facility with which it was exposed to the public eye, and</a>
<a id='line_414'>      prostituted to licentious desire. Her venal charms were abandoned</a>
<a id='line_415'>      to a promiscuous crowd of citizens and strangers of every rank,</a>
<a id='line_416'>      and of every profession: the fortunate lover who had been</a>
<a id='line_417'>      promised a night of enjoyment, was often driven from her bed by a</a>
<a id='line_418'>      stronger or more wealthy favorite; and when she passed through</a>
<a id='line_419'>      the streets, her presence was avoided by all who wished to escape</a>
<a id='line_420'>      either the scandal or the temptation. The satirical historian has</a>
<a id='line_421'>      not blushed 23 to describe the naked scenes which Theodora was</a>
<a id='line_422'>      not ashamed to exhibit in the theatre. 24 After exhausting the</a>
<a id='line_423'>      arts of sensual pleasure, 25 she most ungratefully murmured</a>
<a id='line_424'>      against the parsimony of Nature; 26 but her murmurs, her</a>
<a id='line_425'>      pleasures, and her arts, must be veiled in the obscurity of a</a>
<a id='line_426'>      learned language. After reigning for some time, the delight and</a>
<a id='line_427'>      contempt of the capital, she condescended to accompany Ecebolus,</a>
<a id='line_428'>      a native of Tyre, who had obtained the government of the African</a>
<a id='line_429'>      Pentapolis. But this union was frail and transient; Ecebolus soon</a>
<a id='line_430'>      rejected an expensive or faithless concubine; she was reduced at</a>
<a id='line_431'>      Alexandria to extreme distress; and in her laborious return to</a>
<a id='line_432'>      Constantinople, every city of the East admired and enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_433'>      fair Cyprian, whose merit appeared to justify her descent from</a>
<a id='line_434'>      the peculiar island of Venus. The vague commerce of Theodora, and</a>
<a id='line_435'>      the most detestable precautions, preserved her from the danger</a>
<a id='line_436'>      which she feared; yet once, and once only, she became a mother.</a>
<a id='line_437'>      The infant was saved and educated in Arabia, by his father, who</a>
<a id='line_438'>      imparted to him on his death-bed, that he was the son of an</a>
<a id='line_439'>      empress. Filled with ambitious hopes, the unsuspecting youth</a>
<a id='line_440'>      immediately hastened to the palace of Constantinople, and was</a>
<a id='line_441'>      admitted to the presence of his mother. As he was never more</a>
<a id='line_442'>      seen, even after the decease of Theodora, she deserves the foul</a>
<a id='line_443'>      imputation of extinguishing with his life a secret so offensive</a>

<a id='line_498'>      chastity and solitude in a small house, which she afterwards</a>
<a id='line_499'>      changed into a magnificent temple. 27 Her beauty, assisted by art</a>
<a id='line_500'>      or accident, soon attracted, captivated, and fixed, the patrician</a>
<a id='line_501'>      Justinian, who already reigned with absolute sway under the name</a>
<a id='line_502'>      of his uncle. Perhaps she contrived to enhance the value of a</a>
<a id='line_503'>      gift which she had so often lavished on the meanest of mankind;</a>
<a id='line_504'>      perhaps she inflamed, at first by modest delays, and at last by</a>
<a id='line_505'>      sensual allurements, the desires of a lover, who, from nature or</a>
<a id='line_506'>      devotion, was addicted to long vigils and abstemious diet. When</a>
<a id='line_507'>      his first transports had subsided, she still maintained the same</a>
<a id='line_508'>      ascendant over his mind, by the more solid merit of temper and</a>
<a id='line_509'>      understanding. Justinian delighted to ennoble and enrich the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      object of his affection; the treasures of the East were poured at</a>
<a id='line_511'>      her feet, and the nephew of Justin was determined, perhaps by</a>
<a id='line_512'>      religious scruples, to bestow on his concubine the sacred and</a>
<a id='line_513'>      legal character of a wife. But the laws of Rome expressly</a>
<a id='line_514'>      prohibited the marriage of a senator with any female who had been</a>
<a id='line_515'>      dishonored by a servile origin or theatrical profession: the</a>
<a id='line_516'>      empress Lupicina, or Euphemia, a Barbarian of rustic manners, but</a>
<a id='line_517'>      of irreproachable virtue, refused to accept a prostitute for her</a>
<a id='line_518'>      niece; and even Vigilantia, the superstitious mother of</a>
<a id='line_519'>      Justinian, though she acknowledged the wit and beauty of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      Theodora, was seriously apprehensive, lest the levity and</a>
<a id='line_521'>      arrogance of that artful paramour might corrupt the piety and</a>
<a id='line_522'>      happiness of her son. These obstacles were removed by the</a>
<a id='line_523'>      inflexible constancy of Justinian. He patiently expected the</a>
<a id='line_524'>      death of the empress; he despised the tears of his mother, who</a>
<a id='line_525'>      soon sunk under the weight of her affliction; and a law was</a>
<a id='line_526'>      promulgated in the name of the emperor Justin, which abolished</a>
<a id='line_527'>      the rigid jurisprudence of antiquity. A glorious repentance (the</a>
<a id='line_528'>      words of the edict) was left open for the unhappy females who had</a>
<a id='line_529'>      prostituted their persons on the theatre, and they were permitted</a>
<a id='line_530'>      to contract a legal union with the most illustrious of the</a>
<a id='line_531'>      Romans. 28 This indulgence was speedily followed by the solemn</a>
<a id='line_532'>      nuptials of Justinian and Theodora; her dignity was gradually</a>
<a id='line_533'>      exalted with that of her lover, and, as soon as Justin had</a>
<a id='line_534'>      invested his nephew with the purple, the patriarch of</a>
<a id='line_535'>      Constantinople placed the diadem on the heads of the emperor and</a>
<a id='line_536'>      empress of the East. But the usual honors which the severity of</a>
<a id='line_537'>      Roman manners had allowed to the wives of princes, could not</a>
<a id='line_538'>      satisfy either the ambition of Theodora or the fondness of</a>
<a id='line_539'>      Justinian. He seated her on the throne as an equal and</a>
<a id='line_540'>      independent colleague in the sovereignty of the empire, and an</a>
<a id='line_541'>      oath of allegiance was imposed on the governors of the provinces</a>
<a id='line_542'>      in the joint names of Justinian and Theodora. 29 The Eastern</a>
<a id='line_543'>      world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of the</a>
<a id='line_544'>      daughter of Acacius. The prostitute who, in the presence of</a>
<a id='line_545'>      innumerable spectators, had polluted the theatre of</a>
<a id='line_546'>      Constantinople, was adored as a queen in the same city, by grave</a>

<a id='line_589'>      and gardens which were pleasantly seated on the sea-coast of the</a>

<a id='line_594'>      women and eunuchs, whose interests and passions she indulged at</a>
<a id='line_595'>      the expense of justice; the most illustrious personages of the</a>
<a id='line_596'>      state were crowded into a dark and sultry antechamber, and when</a>
<a id='line_597'>      at last, after tedious attendance, they were admitted to kiss the</a>
<a id='line_598'>      feet of Theodora, they experienced, as her humor might suggest,</a>
<a id='line_599'>      the silent arrogance of an empress, or the capricious levity of a</a>
<a id='line_600'>      comedian. Her rapacious avarice to accumulate an immense</a>
<a id='line_601'>      treasure, may be excused by the apprehension of her husband’s</a>
<a id='line_602'>      death, which could leave no alternative between ruin and the</a>
<a id='line_603'>      throne; and fear as well as ambition might exasperate Theodora</a>
<a id='line_604'>      against two generals, who, during the malady of the emperor, had</a>
<a id='line_605'>      rashly declared that they were not disposed to acquiesce in the</a>
<a id='line_606'>      choice of the capital. But the reproach of cruelty, so repugnant</a>
<a id='line_607'>      even to her softer vices, has left an indelible stain on the</a>
<a id='line_608'>      memory of Theodora. Her numerous spies observed, and zealously</a>

<a id='line_610'>      royal mistress. Whomsoever they accused were cast into her</a>

<a id='line_612'>      and it was rumored, that the torture of the rack, or scourge, had</a>
<a id='line_613'>      been inflicted in the presence of the female tyrant, insensible</a>
<a id='line_614'>      to the voice of prayer or of pity. 32 Some of these unhappy</a>

<a id='line_637'>      If the creed of Theodora had not been tainted with heresy, her</a>
<a id='line_638'>      exemplary devotion might have atoned, in the opinion of her</a>

<a id='line_640'>      employed her influence to assuage the intolerant fury of the</a>
<a id='line_641'>      emperor, the present age will allow some merit to her religion,</a>
<a id='line_642'>      and much indulgence to her speculative errors. 34 The name of</a>
<a id='line_643'>      Theodora was introduced, with equal honor, in all the pious and</a>
<a id='line_644'>      charitable foundations of Justinian; and the most benevolent</a>
<a id='line_645'>      institution of his reign may be ascribed to the sympathy of the</a>
<a id='line_646'>      empress for her less fortunate sisters, who had been seduced or</a>
<a id='line_647'>      compelled to embrace the trade of prostitution. A palace, on the</a>
<a id='line_648'>      Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, was converted into a stately and</a>
<a id='line_649'>      spacious monastery, and a liberal maintenance was assigned to</a>
<a id='line_650'>      five hundred women, who had been collected from the streets and</a>
<a id='line_651'>      brothels of Constantinople. In this safe and holy retreat, they</a>
<a id='line_652'>      were devoted to perpetual confinement; and the despair of some,</a>
<a id='line_653'>      who threw themselves headlong into the sea, was lost in the</a>
<a id='line_654'>      gratitude of the penitents, who had been delivered from sin and</a>
<a id='line_655'>      misery by their generous benefactress. 35 The prudence of</a>
<a id='line_656'>      Theodora is celebrated by Justinian himself; and his laws are</a>
<a id='line_657'>      attributed to the sage counsels of his most reverend wife whom he</a>
<a id='line_658'>      had received as the gift of the Deity. 36 Her courage was</a>
<a id='line_659'>      displayed amidst the tumult of the people and the terrors of the</a>
<a id='line_660'>      court. Her chastity, from the moment of her union with Justinian,</a>
<a id='line_661'>      is founded on the silence of her implacable enemies; and although</a>
<a id='line_662'>      the daughter of Acacius might be satiated with love, yet some</a>
<a id='line_663'>      applause is due to the firmness of a mind which could sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_664'>      pleasure and habit to the stronger sense either of duty or</a>
<a id='line_665'>      interest. The wishes and prayers of Theodora could never obtain</a>
<a id='line_666'>      the blessing of a lawful son, and she buried an infant daughter,</a>
<a id='line_667'>      the sole offspring of her marriage. 37 Notwithstanding this</a>
<a id='line_668'>      disappointment, her dominion was permanent and absolute; she</a>
<a id='line_669'>      preserved, by art or merit, the affections of Justinian; and</a>
<a id='line_670'>      their seeming dissensions were always fatal to the courtiers who</a>
<a id='line_671'>      believed them to be sincere. Perhaps her health had been impaired</a>
<a id='line_672'>      by the licentiousness of her youth; but it was always delicate,</a>
<a id='line_673'>      and she was directed by her physicians to use the Pythian warm</a>
<a id='line_674'>      baths. In this journey, the empress was followed by the</a>
<a id='line_675'>      Praetorian praefect, the great treasurer, several counts and</a>
<a id='line_676'>      patricians, and a splendid train of four thousand attendants: the</a>
<a id='line_677'>      highways were repaired at her approach; a palace was erected for</a>
<a id='line_678'>      her reception; and as she passed through Bithynia, she</a>
<a id='line_679'>      distributed liberal alms to the churches, the monasteries, and</a>
<a id='line_680'>      the hospitals, that they might implore Heaven for the restoration</a>
<a id='line_681'>      of her health. 38 At length, in the twenty-fourth year of her</a>
<a id='line_682'>      marriage, and the twenty-second of her reign, she was consumed by</a>
<a id='line_683'>      a cancer; 39 and the irreparable loss was deplored by her</a>

<a id='line_735'>      servile hands; and if the profits of a favorite charioteer</a>

<a id='line_737'>      as the effects of popular extravagance, and the high wages of a</a>
<a id='line_738'>      disgraceful profession. The race, in its first institution, was a</a>

<a id='line_800'>      scarcely equalled the obstinacy of this wanton discord, which</a>

<a id='line_805'>      trampled under foot, and as long as the party was successful, its</a>
<a id='line_806'>      deluded followers appeared careless of private distress or public</a>
<a id='line_807'>      calamity. The license, without the freedom, of democracy, was</a>
<a id='line_808'>      revived at Antioch and Constantinople, and the support of a</a>
<a id='line_809'>      faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or</a>
<a id='line_810'>      ecclesiastical honors. A secret attachment to the family or sect</a>

<a id='line_812'>      devoted to the cause of orthodoxy and Justinian, 46 and their</a>

<a id='line_817'>      dress, the long hair of the Huns, their close sleeves and ample</a>
<a id='line_818'>      garments, a lofty step, and a sonorous voice. In the day they</a>
<a id='line_819'>      concealed their two-edged poniards, but in the night they boldly</a>
<a id='line_820'>      assembled in arms, and in numerous bands, prepared for every act</a>
<a id='line_821'>      of violence and rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction,</a>
<a id='line_822'>      or even inoffensive citizens, were stripped and often murdered by</a>
<a id='line_823'>      these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold</a>
<a id='line_824'>      buttons or girdles, or to appear at a late hour in the streets of</a>
<a id='line_825'>      a peaceful capital. A daring spirit, rising with impunity,</a>
<a id='line_826'>      proceeded to violate the safeguard of private houses; and fire</a>
<a id='line_827'>      was employed to facilitate the attack, or to conceal the crimes</a>
<a id='line_828'>      of these factious rioters. No place was safe or sacred from their</a>
<a id='line_829'>      depredations; to gratify either avarice or revenge, they</a>
<a id='line_830'>      profusely spilt the blood of the innocent; churches and altars</a>
<a id='line_831'>      were polluted by atrocious murders; and it was the boast of the</a>
<a id='line_832'>      assassins, that their dexterity could always inflict a mortal</a>
<a id='line_833'>      wound with a single stroke of their dagger. The dissolute youth</a>
<a id='line_834'>      of Constantinople adopted the blue livery of disorder; the laws</a>
<a id='line_835'>      were silent, and the bonds of society were relaxed: creditors</a>
<a id='line_836'>      were compelled to resign their obligations; judges to reverse</a>
<a id='line_837'>      their sentence; masters to enfranchise their slaves; fathers to</a>
<a id='line_838'>      supply the extravagance of their children; noble matrons were</a>
<a id='line_839'>      prostituted to the lust of their servants; beautiful boys were</a>
<a id='line_840'>      torn from the arms of their parents; and wives, unless they</a>
<a id='line_841'>      preferred a voluntary death, were ravished in the presence of</a>
<a id='line_842'>      their husbands. 47 The despair of the greens, who were persecuted</a>
<a id='line_843'>      by their enemies, and deserted by the magistrates, assumed the</a>
<a id='line_844'>      privilege of defence, perhaps of retaliation; but those who</a>
<a id='line_845'>      survived the combat were dragged to execution, and the unhappy</a>
<a id='line_846'>      fugitives, escaping to woods and caverns, preyed without mercy on</a>
<a id='line_847'>      the society from whence they were expelled. Those ministers of</a>
<a id='line_848'>      justice who had courage to punish the crimes, and to brave the</a>
<a id='line_849'>      resentment, of the blues, became the victims of their indiscreet</a>
<a id='line_850'>      zeal; a praefect of Constantinople fled for refuge to the holy</a>
<a id='line_851'>      sepulchre, a count of the East was ignominiously whipped, and a</a>
<a id='line_852'>      governor of Cilicia was hanged, by the order of Theodora, on the</a>
<a id='line_853'>      tomb of two assassins whom he had condemned for the murder of his</a>
<a id='line_854'>      groom, and a daring attack upon his own life. 48 An aspiring</a>

<a id='line_859'>      announced his firm resolution to support the innocent, and to</a>

<a id='line_909'>      celebrated the festival of the ides of January; the games were</a>
<a id='line_910'>      incessantly disturbed by the clamorous discontent of the greens:</a>
<a id='line_911'>      till the twenty-second race, the emperor maintained his silent</a>
<a id='line_912'>      gravity; at length, yielding to his impatience, he condescended</a>
<a id='line_913'>      to hold, in abrupt sentences, and by the voice of a crier, the</a>
<a id='line_914'>      most singular dialogue 50 that ever passed between a prince and</a>
<a id='line_915'>      his subjects. Their first complaints were respectful and modest;</a>
<a id='line_916'>      they accused the subordinate ministers of oppression, and</a>
<a id='line_917'>      proclaimed their wishes for the long life and victory of the</a>
<a id='line_918'>      emperor. “Be patient and attentive, ye insolent railers!”</a>
<a id='line_919'>      exclaimed Justinian; “be mute, ye Jews, Samaritans, and</a>
<a id='line_920'>      Manichaeans!” The greens still attempted to awaken his</a>
<a id='line_921'>      compassion. “We are poor, we are innocent, we are injured, we</a>
<a id='line_922'>      dare not pass through the streets: a general persecution is</a>
<a id='line_923'>      exercised against our name and color. Let us die, O emperor! but</a>
<a id='line_924'>      let us die by your command, and for your service!” But the</a>
<a id='line_925'>      repetition of partial and passionate invectives degraded, in</a>
<a id='line_926'>      their eyes, the majesty of the purple; they renounced allegiance</a>
<a id='line_927'>      to the prince who refused justice to his people; lamented that</a>
<a id='line_928'>      the father of Justinian had been born; and branded his son with</a>
<a id='line_929'>      the opprobrious names of a homicide, an ass, and a perjured</a>
<a id='line_930'>      tyrant. “Do you despise your lives?” cried the indignant monarch:</a>
<a id='line_931'>      the blues rose with fury from their seats; their hostile clamors</a>
<a id='line_932'>      thundered in the hippodrome; and their adversaries, deserting the</a>
<a id='line_933'>      unequal contest spread terror and despair through the streets of</a>
<a id='line_934'>      Constantinople. At this dangerous moment, seven notorious</a>
<a id='line_935'>      assassins of both factions, who had been condemned by the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      praefect, were carried round the city, and afterwards transported</a>
<a id='line_937'>      to the place of execution in the suburb of Pera. Four were</a>
<a id='line_938'>      immediately beheaded; a fifth was hanged: but when the same</a>
<a id='line_939'>      punishment was inflicted on the remaining two, the rope broke,</a>
<a id='line_940'>      they fell alive to the ground, the populace applauded their</a>
<a id='line_941'>      escape, and the monks of St. Conon, issuing from the neighboring</a>
<a id='line_942'>      convent, conveyed them in a boat to the sanctuary of the church.</a>
<a id='line_943'>      51 As one of these criminals was of the blue, and the other of</a>
<a id='line_944'>      the green livery, the two factions were equally provoked by the</a>
<a id='line_945'>      cruelty of their oppressor, or the ingratitude of their patron;</a>
<a id='line_946'>      and a short truce was concluded till they had delivered their</a>
<a id='line_947'>      prisoners and satisfied their revenge. The palace of the</a>
<a id='line_948'>      praefect, who withstood the seditious torrent, was instantly</a>
<a id='line_949'>      burnt, his officers and guards were massacred, the prisons were</a>
<a id='line_950'>      forced open, and freedom was restored to those who could only use</a>
<a id='line_951'>      it for the public destruction. A military force, which had been</a>
<a id='line_952'>      despatched to the aid of the civil magistrate, was fiercely</a>
<a id='line_953'>      encountered by an armed multitude, whose numbers and boldness</a>
<a id='line_954'>      continually increased; and the Heruli, the wildest Barbarians in</a>
<a id='line_955'>      the service of the empire, overturned the priests and their</a>
<a id='line_956'>      relics, which, from a pious motive, had been rashly interposed to</a>
<a id='line_957'>      separate the bloody conflict. The tumult was exasperated by this</a>
<a id='line_958'>      sacrilege, the people fought with enthusiasm in the cause of God;</a>
<a id='line_959'>      the women, from the roofs and windows, showered stones on the</a>
<a id='line_960'>      heads of the soldiers, who darted fire brands against the houses;</a>
<a id='line_961'>      and the various flames, which had been kindled by the hands of</a>
<a id='line_962'>      citizens and strangers, spread without control over the face of</a>
<a id='line_963'>      the city. The conflagration involved the cathedral of St. Sophia,</a>
<a id='line_964'>      the baths of Zeuxippus, a part of the palace, from the first</a>
<a id='line_965'>      entrance to the altar of Mars, and the long portico from the</a>

<a id='line_1000'>      integrity. After this popular concession, Justinian proceeded to</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      the hippodrome to confess his own errors, and to accept the</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      repentance of his grateful subjects; but they distrusted his</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      assurances, though solemnly pronounced in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      holy Gospels; and the emperor, alarmed by their distrust,</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      retreated with precipitation to the strong fortress of the</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      palace. The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputed to a secret</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      and ambitious conspiracy, and a suspicion was entertained, that</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      the insurgents, more especially the green faction, had been</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      supplied with arms and money by Hypatius and Pompey, two</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      patricians, who could neither forget with honor, nor remember</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      with safety, that they were the nephews of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      Anastasius. Capriciously trusted, disgraced, and pardoned, by the</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      jealous levity of the monarch, they had appeared as loyal</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      servants before the throne; and, during five days of the tumult,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      they were detained as important hostages; till at length, the</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      fears of Justinian prevailing over his prudence, he viewed the</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      two brothers in the light of spies, perhaps of assassins, and</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      sternly commanded them to depart from the palace. After a</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      fruitless representation, that obedience might lead to</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      involuntary treason, they retired to their houses, and in the</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      morning of the sixth day, Hypatius was surrounded and seized by</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      the people, who, regardless of his virtuous resistance, and the</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      tears of his wife, transported their favorite to the forum of</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      Constantine, and instead of a diadem, placed a rich collar on his</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      head. If the usurper, who afterwards pleaded the merit of his</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      delay, had complied with the advice of his senate, and urged the</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      fury of the multitude, their first irresistible effort might have</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      oppressed or expelled his trembling competitor. The Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      palace enjoyed a free communication with the sea; vessels lay</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      ready at the garden stairs; and a secret resolution was already</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      formed, to convey the emperor with his family and treasures to a</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      safe retreat, at some distance from the capital.</a>
<a id='line_1033'></a>
<a id='line_1034'>      Justinian was lost, if the prostitute whom he raised from the</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      theatre had not renounced the timidity, as well as the virtues,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      of her sex. In the midst of a council, where Belisarius was</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      present, Theodora alone displayed the spirit of a hero; and she</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      alone, without apprehending his future hatred, could save the</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      emperor from the imminent danger, and his unworthy fears. “If</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      flight,” said the consort of Justinian, “were the only means of</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      safety, yet I should disdain to fly. Death is the condition of</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      our birth; but they who have reigned should never survive the</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      loss of dignity and dominion. I implore Heaven, that I may never</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      be seen, not a day, without my diadem and purple; that I may no</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      longer behold the light, when I cease to be saluted with the name</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      of queen. If you resolve, O Caesar! to fly, you have treasures;</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      behold the sea, you have ships; but tremble lest the desire of</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      life should expose you to wretched exile and ignominious death.</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      For my own part, I adhere to the maxim of antiquity, that the</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      throne is a glorious sepulchre.” The firmness of a woman restored</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      the courage to deliberate and act, and courage soon discovers the</a>
<a id='line_1052'>      resources of the most desperate situation. It was an easy and a</a>
<a id='line_1053'>      decisive measure to revive the animosity of the factions; the</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      blues were astonished at their own guilt and folly, that a</a>
<a id='line_1055'>      trifling injury should provoke them to conspire with their</a>
<a id='line_1056'>      implacable enemies against a gracious and liberal benefactor;</a>
<a id='line_1057'>      they again proclaimed the majesty of Justinian; and the greens,</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      with their upstart emperor, were left alone in the hippodrome.</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      The fidelity of the guards was doubtful; but the military force</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      of Justinian consisted in three thousand veterans, who had been</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      trained to valor and discipline in the Persian and Illyrian wars.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>      Under the command of Belisarius and Mundus, they silently marched</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      in two divisions from the palace, forced their obscure way</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      through narrow passages, expiring flames, and falling edifices,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      and burst open at the same moment the two opposite gates of the</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      hippodrome. In this narrow space, the disorderly and affrighted</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      crowd was incapable of resisting on either side a firm and</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      regular attack; the blues signalized the fury of their</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      repentance; and it is computed, that above thirty thousand</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      the day. Hypatius was dragged from his throne, and conducted,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      with his brother Pompey, to the feet of the emperor: they</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      implored his clemency; but their crime was manifest, their</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      innocence uncertain, and Justinian had been too much terrified to</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      forgive. The next morning the two nephews of Anastasius, with</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      eighteen illustrious accomplices, of patrician or consular rank,</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      were privately executed by the soldiers; their bodies were thrown</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      into the sea, their palaces razed, and their fortunes</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      confiscated. The hippodrome itself was condemned, during several</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      years, to a mournful silence: with the restoration of the games,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      the same disorders revived; and the blue and green factions</a>

<a id='line_1437'>      the extremities of Asia. 74 Two Persian monks had long resided in</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      China, perhaps in the royal city of Nankin, the seat of a monarch</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      addicted to foreign superstitions, and who actually received an</a>

<a id='line_1443'>      education (either on trees or in houses) had once been considered</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      as the labor of queens. 75 They soon discovered that it was</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      impracticable to transport the short-lived insect, but that in</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      the eggs a numerous progeny might be preserved and multiplied in</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      a distant climate. Religion or interest had more power over the</a>

<a id='line_1450'>      to the emperor, and were liberally encouraged by the gifts and</a>

<a id='line_1455'>      concealing the eggs of the silk-worm in a hollow cane, and</a>

<a id='line_1646'>      steps by which Lydus reached his humbler eminence may likewise</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      throw light on the civil service at this period. He was first</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      received into the office of the Praetorian praefect; became a</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      notary in that office, and made in one year 1000 golden solidi,</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      and that without extortion. His place and the influence of his</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      relatives obtained him a wife with 400 pounds of gold for her</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      dowry. He became chief chartularius, with an annual stipend of</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      twenty-four solidi, and considerable emoluments for all the</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      various services which he performed. He rose to an Augustalis,</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      and finally to the dignity of Corniculus, the highest, and at one</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      time the most lucrative office in the department. But the</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      Praetorian praefect had gradually been deprived of his powers and</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      his honors. He lost the superintendence of the supply and</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      manufacture of arms; the uncontrolled charge of the public posts;</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      the levying of the troops; the command of the army in war when</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      the emperors ceased nominally to command in person, but really</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      through the Praetorian praefect; that of the household troops,</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      which fell to the magister aulae. At length the office was so</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      completely stripped of its power, as to be virtually abolished,</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      (see de Magist. l. iii. c. 40, p. 220, &c.) This diminution of</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      the office of the praefect destroyed the emoluments of his</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      subordinate officers, and Lydus not only drew no revenue from his</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      dignity, but expended upon it all the gains of his former</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      services. Lydus gravely refers this calamitous, and, as he</a>

<a id='line_1677'>      After this precaution, I shall briefly relate the anecdotes of</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      avarice and rapine under the following heads: I. Justinian was so</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      profuse that he could not be liberal. The civil and military</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      officers, when they were admitted into the service of the palace,</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      obtained an humble rank and a moderate stipend; they ascended by</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      seniority to a station of affluence and repose; the annual</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      pensions, of which the most honorable class was abolished by</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      Justinian, amounted to four hundred thousand pounds; and this</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      domestic economy was deplored by the venal or indigent courtiers</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      as the last outrage on the majesty of the empire. The posts, the</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      salaries of physicians, and the nocturnal illuminations, were</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      objects of more general concern; and the cities might justly</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      complain, that he usurped the municipal revenues which had been</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      appropriated to these useful institutions. Even the soldiers were</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      injured; and such was the decay of military spirit, that they</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      were injured with impunity. The emperor refused, at the return of</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      each fifth year, the customary donative of five pieces of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      reduced his veterans to beg their bread, and suffered unpaid</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      armies to melt away in the wars of Italy and Persia. II. The</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      humanity of his predecessors had always remitted, in some</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      auspicious circumstance of their reign, the arrears of the public</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      tribute, and they dexterously assumed the merit of resigning</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      those claims which it was impracticable to enforce. “Justinian,</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      in the space of thirty-two years, has never granted a similar</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      indulgence; and many of his subjects have renounced the</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      possession of those lands whose value is insufficient to satisfy</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      the demands of the treasury. To the cities which had suffered by</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      hostile inroads Anastasius promised a general exemption of seven</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      years: the provinces of Justinian have been ravaged by the</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      Persians and Arabs, the Huns and Sclavonians; but his vain and</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      ridiculous dispensation of a single year has been confined to</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      those places which were actually taken by the enemy.” Such is the</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      language of the secret historian, who expressly denies that any</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      indulgence was granted to Palestine after the revolt of the</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      Samaritans; a false and odious charge, confuted by the authentic</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      record which attests a relief of thirteen centenaries of gold</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      (fifty-two thousand pounds) obtained for that desolate province</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      by the intercession of St. Sabas. 85 III. Procopius has not</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      condescended to explain the system of taxation, which fell like a</a>

<a id='line_1719'>      rigorous principle, that a whole district should be condemned to</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      sustain the partial loss of the persons or property of</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      individuals. The Annona, or supply of corn for the use of the</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      army and capital, was a grievous and arbitrary exaction, which</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      exceeded, perhaps in a tenfold proportion, the ability of the</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      farmer; and his distress was aggravated by the partial injustice</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      of weights and measures, and the expense and labor of distant</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      carriage. In a time of scarcity, an extraordinary requisition was</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      made to the adjacent provinces of Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia:</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      but the proprietors, after a wearisome journey and perilous</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      navigation, received so inadequate a compensation, that they</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      would have chosen the alternative of delivering both the corn and</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      price at the doors of their granaries. These precautions might</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      indicate a tender solicitude for the welfare of the capital; yet</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      Constantinople did not escape the rapacious despotism of</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      Justinian. Till his reign, the Straits of the Bosphorus and</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      Hellespont were open to the freedom of trade, and nothing was</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      prohibited except the exportation of arms for the service of the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      Barbarians. At each of these gates of the city, a praetor was</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      stationed, the minister of Imperial avarice; heavy customs were</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      imposed on the vessels and their merchandise; the oppression was</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      retaliated on the helpless consumer; the poor were afflicted by</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      the artificial scarcity, and exorbitant price of the market; and</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      a people, accustomed to depend on the liberality of their prince,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      might sometimes complain of the deficiency of water and bread. 86</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      The aerial tribute, without a name, a law, or a definite object,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      was an annual gift of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      which the emperor accepted from his Praetorian praefect; and the</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      means of payment were abandoned to the discretion of that</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      powerful magistrate.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>      IV. Even such a tax was less intolerable than the privilege of</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      monopolies, 8611 which checked the fair competition of industry,</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      and, for the sake of a small and dishonest gain, imposed an</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      arbitrary burden on the wants and luxury of the subject. “As</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      soon” (I transcribe the Anecdotes) “as the exclusive sale of silk</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      was usurped by the Imperial treasurer, a whole people, the</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      manufacturers of Tyre and Berytus, was reduced to extreme misery,</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      and either perished with hunger, or fled to the hostile dominions</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      of Persia.” A province might suffer by the decay of its</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      manufactures, but in this example of silk, Procopius has</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      partially overlooked the inestimable and lasting benefit which</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      the empire received from the curiosity of Justinian. His addition</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      of one seventh to the ordinary price of copper money may be</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      interpreted with the same candor; and the alteration, which might</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      be wise, appears to have been innocent; since he neither alloyed</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      the purity, nor enhanced the value, of the gold coin, 87 the</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      legal measure of public and private payments. V. The ample</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      jurisdiction required by the farmers of the revenue to accomplish</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      their engagements might be placed in an odious light, as if they</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      had purchased from the emperor the lives and fortunes of their</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      fellow-citizens. And a more direct sale of honors and offices was</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      transacted in the palace, with the permission, or at least with</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      the connivance, of Justinian and Theodora. The claims of merit,</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      even those of favor, were disregarded, and it was almost</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      reasonable to expect, that the bold adventurer, who had</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      undertaken the trade of a magistrate, should find a rich</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      compensation for infamy, labor, danger, the debts which he had</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      contracted, and the heavy interest which he paid. A sense of the</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      disgrace and mischief of this venal practice, at length awakened</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      the slumbering virtue of Justinian; and he attempted, by the</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      sanction of oaths 88 and penalties, to guard the integrity of his</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      government: but at the end of a year of perjury, his rigorous</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      edict was suspended, and corruption licentiously abused her</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      triumph over the impotence of the laws. VI. The testament of</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      Eulalius, count of the domestics, declared the emperor his sole</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      heir, on condition, however, that he should discharge his debts</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      and legacies, allow to his three daughters a decent maintenance,</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      and bestow each of them in marriage, with a portion of ten pounds</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      of gold. But the splendid fortune of Eulalius had been consumed</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      by fire, and the inventory of his goods did not exceed the</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      trifling sum of five hundred and sixty-four pieces of gold. A</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      similar instance, in Grecian history, admonished the emperor of</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      the honorable part prescribed for his imitation. He checked the</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      selfish murmurs of the treasury, applauded the confidence of his</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      friend, discharged the legacies and debts, educated the three</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      virgins under the eye of the empress Theodora, and doubled the</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      marriage portion which had satisfied the tenderness of their</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      father. 89 The humanity of a prince (for princes cannot be</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      generous) is entitled to some praise; yet even in this act of</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      virtue we may discover the inveterate custom of supplanting the</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      legal or natural heirs, which Procopius imputes to the reign of</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      Justinian. His charge is supported by eminent names and</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      scandalous examples; neither widows nor orphans were spared; and</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      the art of soliciting, or extorting, or supposing testaments, was</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      beneficially practised by the agents of the palace. This base and</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      mischievous tyranny invades the security of private life; and the</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      monarch who has indulged an appetite for gain, will soon be</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      tempted to anticipate the moment of succession, to interpret</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      wealth as an evidence of guilt, and to proceed, from the claim of</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      inheritance, to the power of confiscation. VII. Among the forms</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      of rapine, a philosopher may be permitted to name the conversion</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      of Pagan or heretical riches to the use of the faithful; but in</a>

<a id='line_1859'>      Justinian; but much of the guilt, and still more of the profit,</a>

<a id='line_1865'>      justified his anecdotes by the portrait which he exposes in his</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      public history, of the notorious vices of John of Cappadocia. 92</a>

<a id='line_1868'>      921 His knowledge was not borrowed from the schools, 93 and his</a>

<a id='line_1870'>      native genius, to suggest the wisest counsels, and to find</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      expedients in the most desperate situations. The corruption of</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      his heart was equal to the vigor of his understanding. Although</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      he was suspected of magic and Pagan superstition, he appeared</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      insensible to the fear of God or the reproaches of man; and his</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      aspiring fortune was raised on the death of thousands, the</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      poverty of millions, the ruins of cities, and the desolation of</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      provinces. From the dawn of light to the moment of dinner, he</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      assiduously labored to enrich his master and himself at the</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      expense of the Roman world; the remainder of the day was spent in</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      sensual and obscene pleasures, 931 and the silent hours of the</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      night were interrupted by the perpetual dread of the justice of</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      an assassin. His abilities, perhaps his vices, recommended him to</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      the lasting friendship of Justinian: the emperor yielded with</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      reluctance to the fury of the people; his victory was displayed</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      by the immediate restoration of their enemy; and they felt above</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      ten years, under his oppressive administration, that he was</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      stimulated by revenge, rather than instructed by misfortune.</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      Their murmurs served only to fortify the resolution of Justinian;</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      but the resentment of Theodora, disdained a power before which</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      every knee was bent, and attempted to sow the seeds of discord</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      between the emperor and his beloved consort. Even Theodora</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      herself was constrained to dissemble, to wait a favorable moment,</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      and, by an artful conspiracy, to render John of Coppadocia the</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      accomplice of his own destruction. 932 At a time when Belisarius,</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      unless he had been a hero, must have shown himself a rebel, his</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      wife Antonina, who enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress,</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      communicated his feigned discontent to Euphemia, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      the praefect; the credulous virgin imparted to her father the</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      dangerous project, and John, who might have known the value of</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      oaths and promises, was tempted to accept a nocturnal, and almost</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      treasonable, interview with the wife of Belisarius. An ambuscade</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      of guards and eunuchs had been posted by the command of Theodora;</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      they rushed with drawn swords to seize or to punish the guilty</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      minister: he was saved by the fidelity of his attendants; but</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      instead of appealing to a gracious sovereign, who had privately</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      warned him of his danger, he pusillanimously fled to the</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      sanctuary of the church. The favorite of Justinian was sacrificed</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      to conjugal tenderness or domestic tranquility; the conversion of</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      a praefect into a priest extinguished his ambitious hopes: but</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace, and he</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      retained in the mild exile of Cyzicus an ample portion of his</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      riches. Such imperfect revenge could not satisfy the unrelenting</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      hatred of Theodora; the murder of his old enemy, the bishop of</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      Cyzicus, afforded a decent pretence; and John of Cappadocia,</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      whose actions had deserved a thousand deaths, was at last</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      condemned for a crime of which he was innocent. A great minister,</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      who had been invested with the honors of consul and patrician,</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      was ignominiously scourged like the vilest of malefactors; a</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      tattered cloak was the sole remnant of his fortunes; he was</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      transported in a bark to the place of his banishment at</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      Antinopolis in Upper Egypt, and the praefect of the East begged</a>

<a id='line_1923'>      During an exile of seven years, his life was protracted and</a>

<a id='line_1925'>      death permitted the emperor to recall a servant whom he had</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      abandoned with regret, the ambition of John of Cappadocia was</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      reduced to the humble duties of the sacerdotal profession. His</a>

<a id='line_1995'>      vessels in the harbor of Constantinople, and to protect his</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      benefactor Anastasius against the bold enterprise of Vitalian. 96</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      A machine was fixed on the walls of the city, consisting of a</a>

<a id='line_2002'>      invalidated by the silence of the most authentic historians; and</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      the use of burning-glasses was never adopted in the attack or</a>

<a id='line_2013'>      secret arts of his disciple Anthemius. 101 A citizen of Tralles</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      in Asia had five sons, who were all distinguished in their</a>

<a id='line_2017'>      and Alexander became learned physicians; but the skill of the</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      former was exercised for the benefit of his fellow-citizens,</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      while his more ambitious brother acquired wealth and reputation</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      at Rome. The fame of Metrodorus the grammarian, and of Anthemius</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      the mathematician and architect, reached the ears of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      Justinian, who invited them to Constantinople; and while the one</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      instructed the rising generation in the schools of eloquence, the</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      other filled the capital and provinces with more lasting</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      monuments of his art. In a trifling dispute relative to the walls</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      or windows of their contiguous houses, he had been vanquished by</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      the eloquence of his neighbor Zeno; but the orator was defeated</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      in his turn by the master of mechanics, whose malicious, though</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      harmless, stratagems are darkly represented by the ignorance of</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      Agathias. In a lower room, Anthemius arranged several vessels or</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      caldrons of water, each of them covered by the wide bottom of a</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      leathern tube, which rose to a narrow top, and was artificially</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      conveyed among the joists and rafters of the adjacent building. A</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      fire was kindled beneath the caldron; the steam of the boiling</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      water ascended through the tubes; the house was shaken by the</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      efforts of imprisoned air, and its trembling inhabitants might</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      wonder that the city was unconscious of the earthquake which they</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      had felt. At another time, the friends of Zeno, as they sat at</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      table, were dazzled by the intolerable light which flashed in</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      their eyes from the reflecting mirrors of Anthemius; they were</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      astonished by the noise which he produced from the collision of</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      certain minute and sonorous particles; and the orator declared in</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      tragic style to the senate, that a mere mortal must yield to the</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      power of an antagonist, who shook the earth with the trident of</a>

<a id='line_2118'>      surveyed each day their rapid progress, and encouraged their</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      diligence by his familiarity, his zeal, and his rewards. The new</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      Cathedral of St. Sophia was consecrated by the patriarch, five</a>

<a id='line_2125'>      104 But the pride of the Roman Solomon, before twenty years had</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      elapsed, was humbled by an earthquake, which overthrew the</a>

<a id='line_2128'>      perseverance of the same prince; and in the thirty-sixth year of</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      his reign, Justinian celebrated the second dedication of a temple</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      which remains, after twelve centuries, a stately monument of his</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      fame. The architecture of St. Sophia, which is now converted into</a>
<a id='line_2132'>      the principal mosch, has been imitated by the Turkish sultans,</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      and that venerable pile continues to excite the fond admiration</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      of the Greeks, and the more rational curiosity of European</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      travellers. The eye of the spectator is disappointed by an</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      irregular prospect of half-domes and shelving roofs: the western</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      front, the principal approach, is destitute of simplicity and</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      magnificence; and the scale of dimensions has been much surpassed</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      by several of the Latin cathedrals. But the architect who first</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      erected and aerial cupola, is entitled to the praise of bold</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      design and skilful execution. The dome of St. Sophia, illuminated</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      by four-and-twenty windows, is formed with so small a curve, that</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      the depth is equal only to one sixth of its diameter; the measure</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      of that diameter is one hundred and fifteen feet, and the lofty</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      centre, where a crescent has supplanted the cross, rises to the</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      perpendicular height of one hundred and eighty feet above the</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      pavement. The circle which encompasses the dome, lightly reposes</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      on four strong arches, and their weight is firmly supported by</a>
<a id='line_2149'>      four massy piles, whose strength is assisted, on the northern and</a>
<a id='line_2150'>      southern sides, by four columns of Egyptian granite.</a>
<a id='line_2151'></a>
<a id='line_2152'>      A Greek cross, inscribed in a quadrangle, represents the form of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>      the edifice; the exact breadth is two hundred and forty-three</a>
<a id='line_2154'>      feet, and two hundred and sixty-nine may be assigned for the</a>
<a id='line_2155'>      extreme length from the sanctuary in the east, to the nine</a>
<a id='line_2156'>      western doors, which open into the vestibule, and from thence</a>
<a id='line_2157'>      into the narthex or exterior portico. That portico was the humble</a>
<a id='line_2158'>      station of the penitents. The nave or body of the church was</a>
<a id='line_2159'>      filled by the congregation of the faithful; but the two sexes</a>
<a id='line_2160'>      were prudently distinguished, and the upper and lower galleries</a>
<a id='line_2161'>      were allotted for the more private devotion of the women. Beyond</a>
<a id='line_2162'>      the northern and southern piles, a balustrade, terminated on</a>
<a id='line_2163'>      either side by the thrones of the emperor and the patriarch,</a>
<a id='line_2164'>      divided the nave from the choir; and the space, as far as the</a>
<a id='line_2165'>      steps of the altar, was occupied by the clergy and singers. The</a>
<a id='line_2166'>      altar itself, a name which insensibly became familiar to</a>
<a id='line_2167'>      Christian ears, was placed in the eastern recess, artificially</a>
<a id='line_2168'>      built in the form of a demi-cylinder; and this sanctuary</a>
<a id='line_2169'>      communicated by several doors with the sacristy, the vestry, the</a>
<a id='line_2170'>      baptistery, and the contiguous buildings, subservient either to</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      the pomp of worship, or the private use of the ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      ministers. The memory of past calamities inspired Justinian with</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      a wise resolution, that no wood, except for the doors, should be</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      admitted into the new edifice; and the choice of the materials</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      was applied to the strength, the lightness, or the splendor of</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      the respective parts. The solid piles which contained the cupola</a>
<a id='line_2177'>      were composed of huge blocks of freestone, hewn into squares and</a>
<a id='line_2178'>      triangles, fortified by circles of iron, and firmly cemented by</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      the infusion of lead and quicklime: but the weight of the cupola</a>
<a id='line_2180'>      was diminished by the levity of its substance, which consists</a>
<a id='line_2181'>      either of pumice-stone that floats in the water, or of bricks</a>
<a id='line_2182'>      from the Isle of Rhodes, five times less ponderous than the</a>
<a id='line_2183'>      ordinary sort. The whole frame of the edifice was constructed of</a>
<a id='line_2184'>      brick; but those base materials were concealed by a crust of</a>
<a id='line_2185'>      marble; and the inside of St. Sophia, the cupola, the two larger,</a>
<a id='line_2186'>      and the six smaller, semi-domes, the walls, the hundred columns,</a>
<a id='line_2187'>      and the pavement, delight even the eyes of Barbarians, with a</a>
<a id='line_2188'>      rich and variegated picture. A poet, 105 who beheld the primitive</a>
<a id='line_2189'>      lustre of St. Sophia, enumerates the colors, the shades, and the</a>
<a id='line_2190'>      spots of ten or twelve marbles, jaspers, and porphyries, which</a>
<a id='line_2191'>      nature had profusely diversified, and which were blended and</a>
<a id='line_2192'>      contrasted as it were by a skilful painter. The triumph of Christ</a>
<a id='line_2193'>      was adorned with the last spoils of Paganism, but the greater</a>
<a id='line_2194'>      part of these costly stones was extracted from the quarries of</a>
<a id='line_2195'>      Asia Minor, the isles and continent of Greece, Egypt, Africa, and</a>
<a id='line_2196'>      Gaul. Eight columns of porphyry, which Aurelian had placed in the</a>
<a id='line_2197'>      temple of the sun, were offered by the piety of a Roman matron;</a>
<a id='line_2198'>      eight others of green marble were presented by the ambitious zeal</a>
<a id='line_2199'>      of the magistrates of Ephesus: both are admirable by their size</a>
<a id='line_2200'>      and beauty, but every order of architecture disclaims their</a>
<a id='line_2201'>      fantastic capital. A variety of ornaments and figures was</a>
<a id='line_2202'>      curiously expressed in mosaic; and the images of Christ, of the</a>

<a id='line_2289'>      been framed on the same model: their domes aspired to imitate the</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      cupolas of St. Sophia; but the altar was more judiciously placed</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      under the centre of the dome, at the junction of four stately</a>

<a id='line_2295'>      neither ground nor materials to the architect. A level was formed</a>

<a id='line_2297'>      The stones of a neighboring quarry were hewn into regular forms;</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      each block was fixed on a peculiar carriage, drawn by forty of</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      the strongest oxen, and the roads were widened for the passage of</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      such enormous weights. Lebanon furnished her loftiest cedars for</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      the timbers of the church; and the seasonable discovery of a vein</a>
<a id='line_2302'>      of red marble supplied its beautiful columns, two of which, the</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      supporters of the exterior portico, were esteemed the largest in</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      the world. The pious munificence of the emperor was diffused over</a>
<a id='line_2305'>      the Holy Land; and if reason should condemn the monasteries of</a>
<a id='line_2306'>      both sexes which were built or restored by Justinian, yet charity</a>
<a id='line_2307'>      must applaud the wells which he sunk, and the hospitals which he</a>
<a id='line_2308'>      founded, for the relief of the weary pilgrims. The schismatical</a>
<a id='line_2309'>      temper of Egypt was ill entitled to the royal bounty; but in</a>
<a id='line_2310'>      Syria and Africa, some remedies were applied to the disasters of</a>
<a id='line_2311'>      wars and earthquakes, and both Carthage and Antioch, emerging</a>
<a id='line_2312'>      from their ruins, might revere the name of their gracious</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      benefactor. 107 Almost every saint in the calendar acquired the</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      honors of a temple; almost every city of the empire obtained the</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      solid advantages of bridges, hospitals, and aqueducts; but the</a>
<a id='line_2316'>      severe liberality of the monarch disdained to indulge his</a>
<a id='line_2317'>      subjects in the popular luxury of baths and theatres. While</a>
<a id='line_2318'>      Justinian labored for the public service, he was not unmindful of</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      his own dignity and ease. The Byzantine palace, which had been</a>
<a id='line_2320'>      damaged by the conflagration, was restored with new magnificence;</a>
<a id='line_2321'>      and some notion may be conceived of the whole edifice, by the</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      vestibule or hall, which, from the doors perhaps, or the roof,</a>
<a id='line_2323'>      was surnamed chalce, or the brazen. The dome of a spacious</a>
<a id='line_2324'>      quadrangle was supported by massy pillars; the pavement and walls</a>
<a id='line_2325'>      were incrusted with many-colored marbles—the emerald green of</a>
<a id='line_2326'>      Laconia, the fiery red, and the white Phrygian stone, intersected</a>
<a id='line_2327'>      with veins of a sea-green hue: the mosaic paintings of the dome</a>
<a id='line_2328'>      and sides represented the glories of the African and Italian</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      triumphs. On the Asiatic shore of the Propontis, at a small</a>

<a id='line_2386'>      inhabitants of the frontier, instead of reposing under the shadow</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      of the general defence, were compelled to guard, with incessant</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      vigilance, their separate habitations. The solitude of ancient</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      cities, was replenished; the new foundations of Justinian</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      acquired, perhaps too hastily, the epithets of impregnable and</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      populous; and the auspicious place of his own nativity attracted</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      the grateful reverence of the vainest of princes. Under the name</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      of Justiniana prima, the obscure village of Tauresium became the</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      seat of an archbishop and a praefect, whose jurisdiction extended</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      over seven warlike provinces of Illyricum; 113 and the corrupt</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      appellation of Giustendil still indicates, about twenty miles to</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      the south of Sophia, the residence of a Turkish sanjak. 114 For</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      the use of the emperor’s countryman, a cathedral, a place, and an</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      aqueduct, were speedily constructed; the public and private</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      edifices were adapted to the greatness of a royal city; and the</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      strength of the walls resisted, during the lifetime of Justinian,</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      the unskilful assaults of the Huns and Sclavonians. Their</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      progress was sometimes retarded, and their hopes of rapine were</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      disappointed, by the innumerable castles which, in the provinces</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      of Dacia, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, appeared to</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      cover the whole face of the country. Six hundred of these forts</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      were built or repaired by the emperor; but it seems reasonable to</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      believe, that the far greater part consisted only of a stone or</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      brick tower, in the midst of a square or circular area, which was</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      surrounded by a wall and ditch, and afforded in a moment of</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      danger some protection to the peasants and cattle of the</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      neighboring villages. 115 Yet these military works, which</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      exhausted the public treasure, could not remove the just</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      apprehensions of Justinian and his European subjects. The warm</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      baths of Anchialus in Thrace were rendered as safe as they were</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      salutary; but the rich pastures of Thessalonica were foraged by</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      the Scythian cavalry; the delicious vale of Tempe, three hundred</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      miles from the Danube, was continually alarmed by the sound of</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      war; 116 and no unfortified spot, however distant or solitary,</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      could securely enjoy the blessings of peace. The Straits of</a>
<a id='line_2421'>      Thermopylae, which seemed to protect, but which had so often</a>
<a id='line_2422'>      betrayed, the safety of Greece, were diligently strengthened by</a>
<a id='line_2423'>      the labors of Justinian. From the edge of the sea-shore, through</a>
<a id='line_2424'>      the forests and valleys, and as far as the summit of the</a>
<a id='line_2425'>      Thessalian mountains, a strong wall was continued, which occupied</a>
<a id='line_2426'>      every practicable entrance. Instead of a hasty crowd of peasants,</a>
<a id='line_2427'>      a garrison of two thousand soldiers was stationed along the</a>
<a id='line_2428'>      rampart; granaries of corn and reservoirs of water were provided</a>
<a id='line_2429'>      for their use; and by a precaution that inspired the cowardice</a>
<a id='line_2430'>      which it foresaw, convenient fortresses were erected for their</a>
<a id='line_2431'>      retreat. The walls of Corinth, overthrown by an earthquake, and</a>
<a id='line_2432'>      the mouldering bulwarks of Athens and Plataea, were carefully</a>
<a id='line_2433'>      restored; the Barbarians were discouraged by the prospect of</a>
<a id='line_2434'>      successive and painful sieges: and the naked cities of</a>
<a id='line_2435'>      Peloponnesus were covered by the fortifications of the Isthmus of</a>
<a id='line_2436'>      Corinth. At the extremity of Europe, another peninsula, the</a>
<a id='line_2437'>      Thracian Chersonesus, runs three days’ journey into the sea, to</a>
<a id='line_2438'>      form, with the adjacent shores of Asia, the Straits of the</a>
<a id='line_2439'>      Hellespont. The intervals between eleven populous towns were</a>
<a id='line_2440'>      filled by lofty woods, fair pastures, and arable lands; and the</a>
<a id='line_2441'>      isthmus, of thirty seven stadia or furlongs, had been fortified</a>

<a id='line_2631'>      an aqueduct, and a castle, whose ditches are hewn in the solid</a>
<a id='line_2632'>      rock. From that maritime city, frontier line of five hundred</a>
<a id='line_2633'>      miles may be drawn to the fortress of Circesium, the last Roman</a>

<a id='line_2635'>      five days’ journey to the south, the country rises into dark</a>
<a id='line_2636'>      forests and craggy mountains, as savage though not so lofty as</a>
<a id='line_2637'>      the Alps and the Pyrenees. In this rigorous climate, 128 where</a>
<a id='line_2638'>      the snows seldom melt, the fruits are tardy and tasteless, even</a>
<a id='line_2639'>      honey is poisonous: the most industrious tillage would be</a>
<a id='line_2640'>      confined to some pleasant valleys; and the pastoral tribes</a>
<a id='line_2641'>      obtained a scanty sustenance from the flesh and milk of their</a>
<a id='line_2642'>      cattle. The Chalybians 129 derived their name and temper from the</a>
<a id='line_2643'>      iron quality of the soil; and, since the days of Cyrus, they</a>
<a id='line_2644'>      might produce, under the various appellations of Cha daeans and</a>
<a id='line_2645'>      Zanians, an uninterrupted prescription of war and rapine. Under</a>
<a id='line_2646'>      the reign of Justinian, they acknowledged the god and the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2647'>      of the Romans, and seven fortresses were built in the most</a>
<a id='line_2648'>      accessible passages, to exclude the ambition of the Persian</a>
<a id='line_2649'>      monarch. 130 The principal source of the Euphrates descends from</a>
<a id='line_2650'>      the Chalybian mountains, and seems to flow towards the west and</a>
<a id='line_2651'>      the Euxine: bending to the south-west, the river passes under the</a>
<a id='line_2652'>      walls of Satala and Melitene, (which were restored by Justinian</a>
<a id='line_2653'>      as the bulwarks of the Lesser Armenia,) and gradually approaches</a>
<a id='line_2654'>      the Mediterranean Sea; till at length, repelled by Mount Taurus,</a>
<a id='line_2655'>      131 the Euphrates inclines its long and flexible course to the</a>
<a id='line_2656'>      south-east and the Gulf of Persia. Among the Roman cities beyond</a>
<a id='line_2657'>      the Euphrates, we distinguish two recent foundations, which were</a>
<a id='line_2658'>      named from Theodosius, and the relics of the martyrs; and two</a>
<a id='line_2659'>      capitals, Amida and Edessa, which are celebrated in the history</a>
<a id='line_2660'>      of every age. Their strength was proportioned by Justinian to the</a>
<a id='line_2661'>      danger of their situation. A ditch and palisade might be</a>
<a id='line_2662'>      sufficient to resist the artless force of the cavalry of Scythia;</a>
<a id='line_2663'>      but more elaborate works were required to sustain a regular siege</a>
<a id='line_2664'>      against the arms and treasures of the great king. His skilful</a>
<a id='line_2665'>      engineers understood the methods of conducting deep mines, and of</a>
<a id='line_2666'>      raising platforms to the level of the rampart: he shook the</a>
<a id='line_2667'>      strongest battlements with his military engines, and sometimes</a>
<a id='line_2668'>      advanced to the assault with a line of movable turrets on the</a>
<a id='line_2669'>      backs of elephants. In the great cities of the East, the</a>
<a id='line_2670'>      disadvantage of space, perhaps of position, was compensated by</a>
<a id='line_2671'>      the zeal of the people, who seconded the garrison in the defence</a>
<a id='line_2672'>      of their country and religion; and the fabulous promise of the</a>
<a id='line_2673'>      Son of God, that Edessa should never be taken, filled the</a>
<a id='line_2674'>      citizens with valiant confidence, and chilled the besiegers with</a>
<a id='line_2675'>      doubt and dismay. 132 The subordinate towns of Armenia and</a>
<a id='line_2676'>      Mesopotamia were diligently strengthened, and the posts which</a>
<a id='line_2677'>      appeared to have any command of ground or water were occupied by</a>
<a id='line_2678'>      numerous forts, substantially built of stone, or more hastily</a>
<a id='line_2679'>      erected with the obvious materials of earth and brick. The eye of</a>
<a id='line_2680'>      Justinian investigated every spot; and his cruel precautions</a>
<a id='line_2681'>      might attract the war into some lonely vale, whose peaceful</a>
<a id='line_2682'>      natives, connected by trade and marriage, were ignorant of</a>
<a id='line_2683'>      national discord and the quarrels of princes. Westward of the</a>

<a id='line_2778'>      the soldiers of Cabades was not balanced by any prospect of</a>
<a id='line_2779'>      success, and it was in vain that the Magi deduced a flattering</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      prediction from the indecency of the women 1361 on the ramparts,</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      who had revealed their most secret charms to the eyes of the</a>

<a id='line_2785'>      Scaling-ladders were applied at the dawn of day; the presence of</a>
<a id='line_2786'>      Cabades, his stern command, and his drawn sword, compelled the</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      Persians to vanquish; and before it was sheathed, fourscore</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      thousand of the inhabitants had expiated the blood of their</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      companions. After the siege of Amida, the war continued three</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      years, and the unhappy frontier tasted the full measure of its</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      calamities. The gold of Anastasius was offered too late, the</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      number of his troops was defeated by the number of their</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      generals; the country was stripped of its inhabitants, and both</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      the living and the dead were abandoned to the wild beasts of the</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      desert. The resistance of Edessa, and the deficiency of spoil,</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      inclined the mind of Cabades to peace: he sold his conquests for</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      an exorbitant price; and the same line, though marked with</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      slaughter and devastation, still separated the two empires. To</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      avert the repetition of the same evils, Anastasius resolved to</a>
<a id='line_2800'>      found a new colony, so strong, that it should defy the power of</a>
<a id='line_2801'>      the Persian, so far advanced towards Assyria, that its stationary</a>
<a id='line_2802'>      troops might defend the province by the menace or operation of</a>
<a id='line_2803'>      offensive war. For this purpose, the town of Dara, 137 fourteen</a>
<a id='line_2804'>      miles from Nisibis, and four days’ journey from the Tigris, was</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      peopled and adorned; the hasty works of Anastasius were improved</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      by the perseverance of Justinian; and, without insisting on</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      places less important, the fortifications of Dara may represent</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      the military architecture of the age. The city was surrounded</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      with two walls, and the interval between them, of fifty paces,</a>
<a id='line_2810'>      afforded a retreat to the cattle of the besieged. The inner wall</a>
<a id='line_2811'>      was a monument of strength and beauty: it measured sixty feet</a>
<a id='line_2812'>      from the ground, and the height of the towers was one hundred</a>
<a id='line_2813'>      feet; the loopholes, from whence an enemy might be annoyed with</a>
<a id='line_2814'>      missile weapons, were small, but numerous; the soldiers were</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      planted along the rampart, under the shelter of double galleries,</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      and a third platform, spacious and secure, was raised on the</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      summit of the towers. The exterior wall appears to have been less</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      lofty, but more solid; and each tower was protected by a</a>
<a id='line_2819'>      quadrangular bulwark. A hard, rocky soil resisted the tools of</a>
<a id='line_2820'>      the miners, and on the south-east, where the ground was more</a>
<a id='line_2821'>      tractable, their approach was retarded by a new work, which</a>
<a id='line_2822'>      advanced in the shape of a half-moon. The double and treble</a>
<a id='line_2823'>      ditches were filled with a stream of water; and in the management</a>
<a id='line_2824'>      of the river, the most skilful labor was employed to supply the</a>
<a id='line_2825'>      inhabitants, to distress the besiegers, and to prevent the</a>
<a id='line_2826'>      mischiefs of a natural or artificial inundation. Dara continued</a>

<a id='line_2924'>      which occupies a short declivity between the mountains and the</a>
<a id='line_2925'>      sea: the city, if we give credit to local tradition, had been</a>
<a id='line_2926'>      founded by the Greeks; and this dangerous entrance was fortified</a>
<a id='line_2927'>      by the kings of Persia with a mole, double walls, and doors of</a>
<a id='line_2928'>      iron. The Iberian gates 139 1391 are formed by a narrow passage</a>
<a id='line_2929'>      of six miles in Mount Caucasus, which opens from the northern</a>
<a id='line_2930'>      side of Iberia, or Georgia, into the plain that reaches to the</a>
<a id='line_2931'>      Tanais and the Volga. A fortress, designed by Alexander perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_2932'>      or one of his successors, to command that important pass, had</a>
<a id='line_2933'>      descended by right of conquest or inheritance to a prince of the</a>
<a id='line_2934'>      Huns, who offered it for a moderate price to the emperor; but</a>

<a id='line_2936'>      and the distance, a more vigilant rival interposed, and Cabades</a>
<a id='line_2937'>      forcibly occupied the Straits of Caucasus. The Albanian and</a>
<a id='line_2938'>      Iberian gates excluded the horsemen of Scythia from the shortest</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      and most practicable roads, and the whole front of the mountains</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      was covered by the rampart of Gog and Magog, the long wall which</a>

<a id='line_3014'>      patriotism in the presence of Aristotle, the master of</a>
<a id='line_3015'>      Theophrastus, who taught at Athens with the founders of the Stoic</a>
<a id='line_3016'>      and Epicurean sects. 144 The ingenuous youth of Attica enjoyed</a>
<a id='line_3017'>      the benefits of their domestic education, which was communicated</a>
<a id='line_3018'>      without envy to the rival cities. Two thousand disciples heard</a>
<a id='line_3019'>      the lessons of Theophrastus; 145 the schools of rhetoric must</a>
<a id='line_3020'>      have been still more populous than those of philosophy; and a</a>
<a id='line_3021'>      rapid succession of students diffused the fame of their teachers</a>
<a id='line_3022'>      as far as the utmost limits of the Grecian language and name.</a>
<a id='line_3023'>      Those limits were enlarged by the victories of Alexander; the</a>
<a id='line_3024'>      arts of Athens survived her freedom and dominion; and the Greek</a>
<a id='line_3025'>      colonies which the Macedonians planted in Egypt, and scattered</a>
<a id='line_3026'>      over Asia, undertook long and frequent pilgrimages to worship the</a>
<a id='line_3027'>      Muses in their favorite temple on the banks of the Ilissus. The</a>
<a id='line_3028'>      Latin conquerors respectfully listened to the instructions of</a>
<a id='line_3029'>      their subjects and captives; the names of Cicero and Horace were</a>
<a id='line_3030'>      enrolled in the schools of Athens; and after the perfect</a>
<a id='line_3031'>      settlement of the Roman empire, the natives of Italy, of Africa,</a>
<a id='line_3032'>      and of Britain, conversed in the groves of the academy with their</a>
<a id='line_3033'>      fellow-students of the East. The studies of philosophy and</a>
<a id='line_3034'>      eloquence are congenial to a popular state, which encourages the</a>
<a id='line_3035'>      freedom of inquiry, and submits only to the force of persuasion.</a>
<a id='line_3036'>      In the republics of Greece and Rome, the art of speaking was the</a>
<a id='line_3037'>      powerful engine of patriotism or ambition; and the schools of</a>
<a id='line_3038'>      rhetoric poured forth a colony of statesmen and legislators. When</a>
<a id='line_3039'>      the liberty of public debate was suppressed, the orator, in the</a>
<a id='line_3040'>      honorable profession of an advocate, might plead the cause of</a>
<a id='line_3041'>      innocence and justice; he might abuse his talents in the more</a>
<a id='line_3042'>      profitable trade of panegyric; and the same precepts continued to</a>
<a id='line_3043'>      dictate the fanciful declamations of the sophist, and the chaster</a>
<a id='line_3044'>      beauties of historical composition. The systems which professed</a>
<a id='line_3045'>      to unfold the nature of God, of man, and of the universe,</a>
<a id='line_3046'>      entertained the curiosity of the philosophic student; and</a>
<a id='line_3047'>      according to the temper of his mind, he might doubt with the</a>
<a id='line_3048'>      Sceptics, or decide with the Stoics, sublimely speculate with</a>
<a id='line_3049'>      Plato, or severely argue with Aristotle. The pride of the adverse</a>
<a id='line_3050'>      sects had fixed an unattainable term of moral happiness and</a>
<a id='line_3051'>      perfection; but the race was glorious and salutary; the disciples</a>
<a id='line_3052'>      of Zeno, and even those of Epicurus, were taught both to act and</a>
<a id='line_3053'>      to suffer; and the death of Petronius was not less effectual than</a>
<a id='line_3054'>      that of Seneca, to humble a tyrant by the discovery of his</a>
<a id='line_3055'>      impotence. The light of science could not indeed be confined</a>
<a id='line_3056'>      within the walls of Athens. Her incomparable writers address</a>
<a id='line_3057'>      themselves to the human race; the living masters emigrated to</a>
<a id='line_3058'>      Italy and Asia; Berytus, in later times, was devoted to the study</a>
<a id='line_3059'>      of the law; astronomy and physic were cultivated in the musaeum</a>
<a id='line_3060'>      of Alexandria; but the Attic schools of rhetoric and philosophy</a>
<a id='line_3061'>      maintained their superior reputation from the Peloponnesian war</a>
<a id='line_3062'>      to the reign of Justinian. Athens, though situate in a barren</a>
<a id='line_3063'>      soil, possessed a pure air, a free navigation, and the monuments</a>
<a id='line_3064'>      of ancient art. That sacred retirement was seldom disturbed by</a>
<a id='line_3065'>      the business of trade or government; and the last of the</a>
<a id='line_3066'>      Athenians were distinguished by their lively wit, the purity of</a>
<a id='line_3067'>      their taste and language, their social manners, and some traces,</a>
<a id='line_3068'>      at least in discourse, of the magnanimity of their fathers. In</a>
<a id='line_3069'>      the suburbs of the city, the academy of the Platonists, the</a>
<a id='line_3070'>      lycaeum of the Peripatetics, the portico of the Stoics, and the</a>
<a id='line_3071'>      garden of the Epicureans, were planted with trees and decorated</a>
<a id='line_3072'>      with statues; and the philosophers, instead of being immured in a</a>
<a id='line_3073'>      cloister, delivered their instructions in spacious and pleasant</a>
<a id='line_3074'>      walks, which, at different hours, were consecrated to the</a>
<a id='line_3075'>      exercises of the mind and body. The genius of the founders still</a>
<a id='line_3076'>      lived in those venerable seats; the ambition of succeeding to the</a>
<a id='line_3077'>      masters of human reason excited a generous emulation; and the</a>
<a id='line_3078'>      merit of the candidates was determined, on each vacancy, by the</a>
<a id='line_3079'>      free voices of an enlightened people. The Athenian professors</a>
<a id='line_3080'>      were paid by their disciples: according to their mutual wants and</a>
<a id='line_3081'>      abilities, the price appears to have varied; and Isocrates</a>
<a id='line_3082'>      himself, who derides the avarice of the sophists, required, in</a>
<a id='line_3083'>      his school of rhetoric, about thirty pounds from each of his</a>
<a id='line_3084'>      hundred pupils. The wages of industry are just and honorable, yet</a>
<a id='line_3085'>      the same Isocrates shed tears at the first receipt of a stipend:</a>
<a id='line_3086'>      the Stoic might blush when he was hired to preach the contempt of</a>
<a id='line_3087'>      money; and I should be sorry to discover that Aristotle or Plato</a>
<a id='line_3088'>      so far degenerated from the example of Socrates, as to exchange</a>
<a id='line_3089'>      knowledge for gold. But some property of lands and houses was</a>
<a id='line_3090'>      settled by the permission of the laws, and the legacies of</a>
<a id='line_3091'>      deceased friends, on the philosophic chairs of Athens. Epicurus</a>
<a id='line_3092'>      bequeathed to his disciples the gardens which he had purchased</a>
<a id='line_3093'>      for eighty minae or two hundred and fifty pounds, with a fund</a>
<a id='line_3094'>      sufficient for their frugal subsistence and monthly festivals;</a>
<a id='line_3095'>      146 and the patrimony of Plato afforded an annual rent, which, in</a>
<a id='line_3096'>      eight centuries, was gradually increased from three to one</a>
<a id='line_3097'>      thousand pieces of gold. 147 The schools of Athens were protected</a>
<a id='line_3098'>      by the wisest and most virtuous of the Roman princes. The</a>
<a id='line_3099'>      library, which Hadrian founded, was placed in a portico adorned</a>
<a id='line_3100'>      with pictures, statues, and a roof of alabaster, and supported by</a>
<a id='line_3101'>      one hundred columns of Phrygian marble. The public salaries were</a>
<a id='line_3102'>      assigned by the generous spirit of the Antonines; and each</a>
<a id='line_3103'>      professor of politics, of rhetoric, of the Platonic, the</a>
<a id='line_3104'>      Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean philosophy, received an</a>
<a id='line_3105'>      annual stipend of ten thousand drachmae, or more than three</a>
<a id='line_3106'>      hundred pounds sterling. 148 After the death of Marcus, these</a>
<a id='line_3107'>      liberal donations, and the privileges attached to the thrones of</a>
<a id='line_3108'>      science, were abolished and revived, diminished and enlarged; but</a>
<a id='line_3109'>      some vestige of royal bounty may be found under the successors of</a>
<a id='line_3110'>      Constantine; and their arbitrary choice of an unworthy candidate</a>
<a id='line_3111'>      might tempt the philosophers of Athens to regret the days of</a>
<a id='line_3112'>      independence and poverty. 149 It is remarkable, that the</a>
<a id='line_3113'>      impartial favor of the Antonines was bestowed on the four adverse</a>
<a id='line_3114'>      sects of philosophy, which they considered as equally useful, or</a>
<a id='line_3115'>      at least, as equally innocent. Socrates had formerly been the</a>
<a id='line_3116'>      glory and the reproach of his country; and the first lessons of</a>
<a id='line_3117'>      Epicurus so strangely scandalized the pious ears of the</a>
<a id='line_3118'>      Athenians, that by his exile, and that of his antagonists, they</a>
<a id='line_3119'>      silenced all vain disputes concerning the nature of the gods. But</a>
<a id='line_3120'>      in the ensuing year they recalled the hasty decree, restored the</a>
<a id='line_3121'>      liberty of the schools, and were convinced by the experience of</a>
<a id='line_3122'>      ages, that the moral character of philosophers is not affected by</a>

<a id='line_3182'>      extravagantly mingled a sublime theory with the practice of</a>

<a id='line_3186'>      suspended over their heads. About a century after the reign of</a>
<a id='line_3187'>      Julian, 151 Proclus 152 was permitted to teach in the philosophic</a>

<a id='line_3189'>      frequently, in the same day, pronounced five lessons, and</a>
<a id='line_3190'>      composed seven hundred lines. His sagacious mind explored the</a>
<a id='line_3191'>      deepest questions of morals and metaphysics, and he ventured to</a>
<a id='line_3192'>      urge eighteen arguments against the Christian doctrine of the</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      creation of the world. But in the intervals of study, he</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      personally conversed with Pan, Aesculapius, and Minerva, in whose</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      mysteries he was secretly initiated, and whose prostrate statues</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      he adored; in the devout persuasion that the philosopher, who is</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      a citizen of the universe, should be the priest of its various</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      deities. An eclipse of the sun announced his approaching end; and</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      his life, with that of his scholar Isidore, 153 compiled by two</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      of their most learned disciples, exhibits a deplorable picture of</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      the second childhood of human reason. Yet the golden chain, as it</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      was fondly styled, of the Platonic succession, continued</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      forty-four years from the death of Proclus to the edict of</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      Justinian, 154 which imposed a perpetual silence on the schools</a>
<a id='line_3205'>      of Athens, and excited the grief and indignation of the few</a>
<a id='line_3206'>      remaining votaries of Grecian science and superstition. Seven</a>
<a id='line_3207'>      friends and philosophers, Diogenes and Hermias, Eulalius and</a>
<a id='line_3208'>      Priscian, Damascius, Isidore, and Simplicius, who dissented from</a>
<a id='line_3209'>      the religion of their sovereign, embraced the resolution of</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      seeking in a foreign land the freedom which was denied in their</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      native country. They had heard, and they credulously believed,</a>
<a id='line_3212'>      that the republic of Plato was realized in the despotic</a>
<a id='line_3213'>      government of Persia, and that a patriot king reigned ever the</a>
<a id='line_3214'>      happiest and most virtuous of nations. They were soon astonished</a>
<a id='line_3215'>      by the natural discovery, that Persia resembled the other</a>
<a id='line_3216'>      countries of the globe; that Chosroes, who affected the name of a</a>
<a id='line_3217'>      philosopher, was vain, cruel, and ambitious; that bigotry, and a</a>
<a id='line_3218'>      spirit of intolerance, prevailed among the Magi; that the nobles</a>
<a id='line_3219'>      were haughty, the courtiers servile, and the magistrates unjust;</a>
<a id='line_3220'>      that the guilty sometimes escaped, and that the innocent were</a>
<a id='line_3221'>      often oppressed. The disappointment of the philosophers provoked</a>
<a id='line_3222'>      them to overlook the real virtues of the Persians; and they were</a>
<a id='line_3223'>      scandalized, more deeply perhaps than became their profession,</a>
<a id='line_3224'>      with the plurality of wives and concubines, the incestuous</a>
<a id='line_3225'>      marriages, and the custom of exposing dead bodies to the dogs and</a>
<a id='line_3226'>      vultures, instead of hiding them in the earth, or consuming them</a>
<a id='line_3227'>      with fire. Their repentance was expressed by a precipitate</a>
<a id='line_3228'>      return, and they loudly declared that they had rather die on the</a>
<a id='line_3229'>      borders of the empire, than enjoy the wealth and favor of the</a>
<a id='line_3230'>      Barbarian. From this journey, however, they derived a benefit</a>
<a id='line_3231'>      which reflects the purest lustre on the character of Chosroes. He</a>
<a id='line_3232'>      required, that the seven sages who had visited the court of</a>
<a id='line_3233'>      Persia should be exempted from the penal laws which Justinian</a>
<a id='line_3234'>      enacted against his Pagan subjects; and this privilege, expressly</a>
<a id='line_3235'>      stipulated in a treaty of peace, was guarded by the vigilance of</a>
<a id='line_3236'>      a powerful mediator. 155 Simplicius and his companions ended</a>
<a id='line_3237'>      their lives in peace and obscurity; and as they left no</a>

<a id='line_3289'>      without the cares, enjoyed the splendor of the throne; and at the</a>

<a id='line_3291'>      sovereigns of Rome and Constantinople, for the sole purpose of</a>
<a id='line_3292'>      giving a date to the year, and a festival to the people. But the</a>
<a id='line_3293'>      expenses of this festival, in which the wealthy and the vain</a>
<a id='line_3294'>      aspired to surpass their predecessors, insensibly arose to the</a>
<a id='line_3295'>      enormous sum of fourscore thousand pounds; the wisest senators</a>
<a id='line_3296'>      declined a useless honor, which involved the certain ruin of</a>
<a id='line_3297'>      their families, and to this reluctance I should impute the</a>
<a id='line_3298'>      frequent chasms in the last age of the consular Fasti. The</a>
<a id='line_3299'>      predecessors of Justinian had assisted from the public treasures</a>
<a id='line_3300'>      the dignity of the less opulent candidates; the avarice of that</a>
<a id='line_3301'>      prince preferred the cheaper and more convenient method of advice</a>
<a id='line_3302'>      and regulation. 157 Seven processions or spectacles were the</a>
<a id='line_3303'>      number to which his edict confined the horse and chariot races,</a>
<a id='line_3304'>      the athletic sports, the music, and pantomimes of the theatre,</a>

<a id='line_3306'>      discreetly substituted to the gold medals, which had always</a>
<a id='line_3307'>      excited tumult and drunkenness, when they were scattered with a</a>
<a id='line_3308'>      profuse hand among the populace. Notwithstanding these</a>
<a id='line_3309'>      precautions, and his own example, the succession of consuls</a>
<a id='line_3310'>      finally ceased in the thirteenth year of Justinian, whose</a>
<a id='line_3311'>      despotic temper might be gratified by the silent extinction of a</a>
<a id='line_3312'>      title which admonished the Romans of their ancient freedom. 158</a>
