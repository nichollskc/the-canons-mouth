<a id='line_1'>      Gallienus—Part I.</a>

<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      From the great secular games celebrated by Philip, to the death</a>
<a id='line_8'>      of the emperor Gallienus, there elapsed twenty years of shame and</a>
<a id='line_9'>      misfortune. During that calamitous period, every instant of time</a>
<a id='line_10'>      was marked, every province of the Roman world was afflicted, by</a>
<a id='line_11'>      barbarous invaders, and military tyrants, and the ruined empire</a>
<a id='line_12'>      seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution.</a>
<a id='line_13'>      The confusion of the times, and the scarcity of authentic</a>
<a id='line_14'>      memorials, oppose equal difficulties to the historian, who</a>
<a id='line_15'>      attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration.</a>
<a id='line_16'>      Surrounded with imperfect fragments, always concise, often</a>
<a id='line_17'>      obscure, and sometimes contradictory, he is reduced to collect,</a>
<a id='line_18'>      to compare, and to conjecture: and though he ought never to place</a>
<a id='line_19'>      his conjectures in the rank of facts, yet the knowledge of human</a>
<a id='line_20'>      nature, and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained</a>
<a id='line_21'>      passions, might, on some occasions, supply the want of historical</a>
<a id='line_22'>      materials.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>      There is not, for instance, any difficulty in conceiving, that</a>
<a id='line_25'>      the successive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the</a>
<a id='line_26'>      ties of allegiance between the prince and people; that all the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      generals of Philip were disposed to imitate the example of their</a>
<a id='line_28'>      master; and that the caprice of armies, long since habituated to</a>
<a id='line_29'>      frequent and violent revolutions, might every day raise to the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      throne the most obscure of their fellow-soldiers. History can</a>
<a id='line_31'>      only add, that the rebellion against the emperor Philip broke out</a>
<a id='line_32'>      in the summer of the year two hundred and forty-nine, among the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      legions of Mæsia; and that a subaltern officer, 1 named Marinus,</a>
<a id='line_34'>      was the object of their seditious choice. Philip was alarmed. He</a>
<a id='line_35'>      dreaded lest the treason of the Mæsian army should prove the</a>
<a id='line_36'>      first spark of a general conflagration. Distracted with the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      consciousness of his guilt and of his danger, he communicated the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      intelligence to the senate. A gloomy silence prevailed, the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      effect of fear, and perhaps of disaffection; till at length</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Decius, one of the assembly, assuming a spirit worthy of his</a>
<a id='line_41'>      noble extraction, ventured to discover more intrepidity than the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      emperor seemed to possess. He treated the whole business with</a>
<a id='line_43'>      contempt, as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult, and Philip’s rival</a>
<a id='line_44'>      as a phantom of royalty, who in a very few days would be</a>
<a id='line_45'>      destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him. The</a>
<a id='line_46'>      speedy completion of the prophecy inspired Philip with a just</a>
<a id='line_47'>      esteem for so able a counsellor; and Decius appeared to him the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army</a>
<a id='line_49'>      whose tumultuous spirit did not immediately subside after the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      murder of Marinus. Decius, 2 who long resisted his own</a>
<a id='line_51'>      nomination, seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a</a>
<a id='line_52'>      leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the</a>
<a id='line_53'>      soldiers; and his prediction was again confirmed by the event.</a>
<a id='line_54'>      The legions of Mæsia forced their judge to become their</a>
<a id='line_55'>      accomplice. They left him only the alternative of death or the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      purple. His subsequent conduct, after that decisive measure, was</a>
<a id='line_57'>      unavoidable. He conducted, or followed, his army to the confines</a>
<a id='line_58'>      of Italy, whither Philip, collecting all his force to repel the</a>
<a id='line_59'>      formidable competitor whom he had raised up, advanced to meet</a>
<a id='line_60'>      him. The Imperial troops were superior in number; but the rebels</a>
<a id='line_61'>      formed an army of veterans, commanded by an able and experienced</a>
<a id='line_62'>      leader. Philip was either killed in the battle, or put to death a</a>
<a id='line_63'>      few days afterwards at Verona. His son and associate in the</a>
<a id='line_64'>      empire was massacred at Rome by the Prætorian guards; and the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      victorious Decius, with more favorable circumstances than the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      ambition of that age can usually plead, was universally</a>
<a id='line_67'>      acknowledged by the senate and provinces. It is reported, that,</a>
<a id='line_68'>      immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of</a>
<a id='line_69'>      Augustus, he had assured Philip, by a private message, of his</a>
<a id='line_70'>      innocence and loyalty, solemnly protesting, that, on his arrival</a>
<a id='line_71'>      on Italy, he would resign the Imperial ornaments, and return to</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the condition of an obedient subject. His professions might be</a>
<a id='line_73'>      sincere; but in the situation where fortune had placed him, it</a>
<a id='line_74'>      was scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be</a>
<a id='line_75'>      forgiven. 3</a>

<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>      The emperor Decius had employed a few months in the works of</a>
<a id='line_94'>      peace and the administration of justice, when he was summoned to</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the banks of the Danube by the invasion of the Goths. This is the</a>
<a id='line_96'>      first considerable occasion in which history mentions that great</a>
<a id='line_97'>      people, who afterwards broke the Roman power, sacked the Capitol,</a>
<a id='line_98'>      and reigned in Gaul, Spain, and Italy. So memorable was the part</a>
<a id='line_99'>      which they acted in the subversion of the Western empire, that</a>
<a id='line_100'>      the name of Goths is frequently but improperly used as a general</a>
<a id='line_101'>      appellation of rude and warlike barbarism.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>      In the beginning of the sixth century, and after the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      Italy, the Goths, in possession of present greatness, very</a>
<a id='line_105'>      naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      future glory. They wished to preserve the memory of their</a>
<a id='line_107'>      ancestors, and to transmit to posterity their own achievements.</a>
<a id='line_108'>      The principal minister of the court of Ravenna, the learned</a>
<a id='line_109'>      Cassiodorus, gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a</a>
<a id='line_110'>      Gothic history, which consisted of twelve books, now reduced to</a>
<a id='line_111'>      the imperfect abridgment of Jornandes. 4 These writers passed</a>
<a id='line_112'>      with the most artful conciseness over the misfortunes of the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      nation, celebrated its successful valor, and adorned the triumph</a>
<a id='line_114'>      with many Asiatic trophies, that more properly belonged to the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      people of Scythia. On the faith of ancient songs, the uncertain,</a>
<a id='line_116'>      but the only memorials of barbarians, they deduced the first</a>
<a id='line_117'>      origin of the Goths from the vast island, or peninsula, of</a>
<a id='line_118'>      Scandinavia. 5 501 That extreme country of the North was not</a>
<a id='line_119'>      unknown to the conquerors of Italy: the ties of ancient</a>
<a id='line_120'>      consanguinity had been strengthened by recent offices of</a>
<a id='line_121'>      friendship; and a Scandinavian king had cheerfully abdicated his</a>
<a id='line_122'>      savage greatness, that he might pass the remainder of his days in</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the peaceful and polished court of Ravenna. 6 Many vestiges,</a>
<a id='line_124'>      which cannot be ascribed to the arts of popular vanity, attest</a>
<a id='line_125'>      the ancient residence of the Goths in the countries beyond the</a>
<a id='line_126'>      Rhine. From the time of the geographer Ptolemy, the southern part</a>
<a id='line_127'>      of Sweden seems to have continued in the possession of the less</a>
<a id='line_128'>      enterprising remnant of the nation, and a large territory is even</a>
<a id='line_129'>      at present divided into east and west Gothland. During the middle</a>
<a id='line_130'>      ages, (from the ninth to the twelfth century,) whilst</a>
<a id='line_131'>      Christianity was advancing with a slow progress into the North,</a>
<a id='line_132'>      the Goths and the Swedes composed two distinct and sometimes</a>
<a id='line_133'>      hostile members of the same monarchy. 7 The latter of these two</a>
<a id='line_134'>      names has prevailed without extinguishing the former. The Swedes,</a>
<a id='line_135'>      who might well be satisfied with their own fame in arms, have, in</a>
<a id='line_136'>      every age, claimed the kindred glory of the Goths. In a moment of</a>
<a id='line_137'>      discontent against the court of Rome, Charles the Twelfth</a>
<a id='line_138'>      insinuated, that his victorious troops were not degenerated from</a>
<a id='line_139'>      their brave ancestors, who had already subdued the mistress of</a>
<a id='line_140'>      the world. 8</a>

<a id='line_149'>      501 (return) [ The Goths have inhabited Scandinavia, but it was</a>
<a id='line_150'>      not their original habitation. This great nation was anciently of</a>
<a id='line_151'>      the Suevian race; it occupied, in the time of Tacitus, and long</a>
<a id='line_152'>      before, Mecklenburgh, Pomerania Southern Prussia and the</a>
<a id='line_153'>      north-west of Poland. A little before the birth of J. C., and in</a>
<a id='line_154'>      the first years of that century, they belonged to the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_155'>      Marbod, king of the Marcomanni: but Cotwalda, a young Gothic</a>
<a id='line_156'>      prince, delivered them from that tyranny, and established his own</a>
<a id='line_157'>      power over the kingdom of the Marcomanni, already much weakened</a>
<a id='line_158'>      by the victories of Tiberius. The power of the Goths at that time</a>
<a id='line_159'>      must have been great: it was probably from them that the Sinus</a>
<a id='line_160'>      Codanus (the Baltic) took this name, as it was afterwards called</a>
<a id='line_161'>      Mare Suevicum, and Mare Venedicum, during the superiority of the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      proper Suevi and the Venedi. The epoch in which the Goths passed</a>
<a id='line_163'>      into Scandinavia is unknown. See Adelung, Hist. of Anc. Germany,</a>
<a id='line_164'>      p. 200. Gatterer, Hist. Univ. 458.—G. ——M. St. Martin observes,</a>
<a id='line_165'>      that the Scandinavian descent of the Goths rests on the authority</a>
<a id='line_166'>      of Jornandes, who professed to derive it from the traditions of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      the Goths. He is supported by Procopius and Paulus Diaconus. Yet</a>
<a id='line_168'>      the Goths are unquestionably the same with the Getæ of the</a>
<a id='line_169'>      earlier historians. St. Martin, note on Le Beau, Hist. du bas</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Empire, iii. 324. The identity of the Getæ and Goths is by no</a>
<a id='line_171'>      means generally admitted. On the whole, they seem to be one vast</a>
<a id='line_172'>      branch of the Indo-Teutonic race, who spread irregularly towards</a>
<a id='line_173'>      the north of Europe, and at different periods, and in different</a>
<a id='line_174'>      regions, came in contact with the more civilized nations of the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      south. At this period, there seems to have been a reflux of these</a>
<a id='line_176'>      Gothic tribes from the North. Malte Brun considers that there are</a>
<a id='line_177'>      strong grounds for receiving the Islandic traditions commented by</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the Danish Varro, M. Suhm. From these, and the voyage of Pytheas,</a>
<a id='line_179'>      which Malte Brun considers genuine, the Goths were in possession</a>
<a id='line_180'>      of Scandinavia, Ey-Gothland, 250 years before J. C., and of a</a>

<a id='line_355'>      doubtless the conquering tribe. Cæsar, on the contrary, ranges</a>
<a id='line_356'>      under the name of Suevi, many of the tribes whom Pliny reckons as</a>
<a id='line_357'>      Vandals, because the Suevi, properly so called, were then the</a>

<a id='line_369'>      Wendish race, who were of Sclavonian, not of Suevian or German,</a>
<a id='line_370'>      origin. M. St. Martin supposes that the different races spread</a>

<a id='line_372'>      on the shores of the Adriatic, the Vindelici, the tribes which</a>
<a id='line_373'>      gave their name to Vindobena, Vindoduna, Vindonissa, were</a>
<a id='line_374'>      branches of the same stock with the Sclavonian Venedi, who at one</a>

<a id='line_390'>      destructive inroads. 19 In this interval, therefore, of about</a>
<a id='line_391'>      seventy years we must place the second migration of the Goths</a>

<a id='line_398'>      religion, the numbers and spirit of the Goths were equal to the</a>

<a id='line_422'>      banks of the Prypec, a river universally conceived by the</a>

<a id='line_424'>      windings of that great stream through the plains of Poland and</a>

<a id='line_429'>      progress. The Bastarnæ and the Venedi were the first who</a>

<a id='line_442'>      frontier often perplexed the most accurate observers. 27 As the</a>
<a id='line_443'>      Goths advanced near the Euxine Sea, they encountered a purer race</a>

<a id='line_529'>      The Scythian hordes, which, towards the east, bordered on the new</a>
<a id='line_530'>      settlements of the Goths, presented nothing to their arms, except</a>
<a id='line_531'>      the doubtful chance of an unprofitable victory. But the prospect</a>
<a id='line_532'>      of the Roman territories was far more alluring; and the fields of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      Dacia were covered with rich harvests, sown by the hands of an</a>
<a id='line_534'>      industrious, and exposed to be gathered by those of a warlike,</a>
<a id='line_535'>      people. It is probable that the conquests of Trajan, maintained</a>
<a id='line_536'>      by his successors, less for any real advantage than for ideal</a>
<a id='line_537'>      dignity, had contributed to weaken the empire on that side. The</a>
<a id='line_538'>      new and unsettled province of Dacia was neither strong enough to</a>
<a id='line_539'>      resist, nor rich enough to satiate, the rapaciousness of the</a>
<a id='line_540'>      barbarians. As long as the remote banks of the Niester were</a>
<a id='line_541'>      considered as the boundary of the Roman power, the fortifications</a>
<a id='line_542'>      of the Lower Danube were more carelessly guarded, and the</a>

<a id='line_544'>      themselves at an inaccessible distance from any barbarian</a>
<a id='line_545'>      invaders. The irruptions of the Goths, under the reign of Philip,</a>
<a id='line_546'>      fatally convinced them of their mistake. The king, or leader, of</a>
<a id='line_547'>      that fierce nation, traversed with contempt the province of</a>
<a id='line_548'>      Dacia, and passed both the Niester and the Danube without</a>
<a id='line_549'>      encountering any opposition capable of retarding his progress.</a>
<a id='line_550'>      The relaxed discipline of the Roman troops betrayed the most</a>
<a id='line_551'>      important posts, where they were stationed, and the fear of</a>
<a id='line_552'>      deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to enlist under</a>
<a id='line_553'>      the Gothic standard. The various multitude of barbarians</a>
<a id='line_554'>      appeared, at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a city</a>
<a id='line_555'>      built by Trajan in honor of his sister, and at that time the</a>

<a id='line_640'>      the Antonines, had so impetuously urged the decline of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_641'>      greatness. He soon discovered that it was impossible to replace</a>
<a id='line_642'>      that greatness on a permanent basis without restoring public</a>
<a id='line_643'>      virtue, ancient principles and manners, and the oppressed majesty</a>
<a id='line_644'>      of the laws. To execute this noble but arduous design, he first</a>
<a id='line_645'>      resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor; an office</a>
<a id='line_646'>      which, as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity, had</a>
<a id='line_647'>      so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state, 37 till it</a>
<a id='line_648'>      was usurped and gradually neglected by the Cæsars. 38 Conscious</a>
<a id='line_649'>      that the favor of the sovereign may confer power, but that the</a>
<a id='line_650'>      esteem of the people can alone bestow authority, he submitted the</a>

<a id='line_653'>      afterwards emperor, and who then served with distinction in the</a>
<a id='line_654'>      army of Decius, was declared the most worthy of that exalted</a>
<a id='line_655'>      honor. As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to the</a>
<a id='line_656'>      emperor, he assembled a great council in his camp, and before the</a>
<a id='line_657'>      investiture of the censor elect, he apprised him of the</a>
<a id='line_658'>      difficulty and importance of his great office. “Happy Valerian,”</a>

<a id='line_696'>      envy and of suspicion. He modestly argued the alarming greatness</a>
<a id='line_697'>      of the trust, his own insufficiency, and the incurable corruption</a>
<a id='line_698'>      of the times. He artfully insinuated, that the office of censor</a>
<a id='line_699'>      was inseparable from the Imperial dignity, and that the feeble</a>
<a id='line_700'>      hands of a subject were unequal to the support of such an immense</a>

<a id='line_702'>      soon put an end to the prosecution of a project so specious, but</a>

<a id='line_705'>      would most probably have attended it. A censor may maintain, he</a>

<a id='line_744'>      the honors of the purple, was slain by an arrow, in the sight of</a>

<a id='line_746'>      admonished the dismayed troops, that the loss of a single soldier</a>
<a id='line_747'>      was of little importance to the republic. 45 The conflict was</a>
<a id='line_748'>      terrible; it was the combat of despair against grief and rage.</a>
<a id='line_749'>      The first line of the Goths at length gave way in disorder; the</a>
<a id='line_750'>      second, advancing to sustain it, shared its fate; and the third</a>
<a id='line_751'>      only remained entire, prepared to dispute the passage of the</a>
<a id='line_752'>      morass, which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      enemy. “Here the fortune of the day turned, and all things became</a>
<a id='line_754'>      adverse to the Romans; the place deep with ooze, sinking under</a>
<a id='line_755'>      those who stood, slippery to such as advanced; their armor heavy,</a>

<a id='line_758'>      inured to encounter in the bogs, their persons tall, their spears</a>

<a id='line_881'>      acclamations of the soldiers proclaimed him emperor on the field</a>
<a id='line_882'>      of battle. 57 Gallus, who, careless of the general welfare,</a>
<a id='line_883'>      indulged himself in the pleasures of Italy, was almost in the</a>
<a id='line_884'>      same instant informed of the success, of the revolt, and of the</a>
<a id='line_885'>      rapid approach of his aspiring lieutenant. He advanced to meet</a>
<a id='line_886'>      him as far as the plains of Spoleto. When the armies came in</a>
<a id='line_887'>      sight of each other, the soldiers of Gallus compared the</a>
<a id='line_888'>      ignominious conduct of their sovereign with the glory of his</a>
<a id='line_889'>      rival. They admired the valor of Æmilianus; they were attracted</a>

<a id='line_894'>      Æmilianus to that assembly displayed a mixture of moderation and</a>

<a id='line_962'>      instead of making a judicious choice, which would have confirmed</a>

<a id='line_1279'>      but more glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower</a>

<a id='line_1284'>      credulity of the historian, or to some exaggerated exploits of</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      one of the emperor’s lieutenants. It was by arms of a very</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      different nature, that Gallienus endeavored to protect Italy from</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      the fury of the Germans. He espoused Pipa, the daughter of a king</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      of the Marcomanni, a Suevic tribe, which was often confounded</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      with the Alemanni in their wars and conquests. 92 To the father,</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      as the price of his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      Pannonia. The native charms of unpolished beauty seem to have</a>

<a id='line_1313'>      but it was defended by the Romans with more than usual firmness</a>

<a id='line_1342'>      gradual intercourse with the Grecian colonies, which settled</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      along the maritime coast. The little kingdom of Bosphorus, whose</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      capital was situated on the Straits, through which the Mæotis</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      communicates itself to the Euxine, was composed of degenerate</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      Greeks and half-civilized barbarians. It subsisted, as an</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      independent state, from the time of the Peloponnesian war, 98 was</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      at last swallowed up by the ambition of Mithridates, 99 and, with</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      the rest of his dominions, sunk under the weight of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      arms. From the reign of Augustus, 100 the kings of Bosphorus were</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      the humble, but not useless, allies of the empire. By presents,</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      by arms, and by a slight fortification drawn across the Isthmus,</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      they effectually guarded, against the roving plunderers of</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      Sarmatia, the access of a country which, from its peculiar</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      situation and convenient harbors, commanded the Euxine Sea and</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      Asia Minor. 101 As long as the sceptre was possessed by a lineal</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      succession of kings, they acquitted themselves of their important</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      charge with vigilance and success. Domestic factions, and the</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      fears, or private interest, of obscure usurpers, who seized on</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      the vacant throne, admitted the Goths into the heart of</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      Bosphorus. With the acquisition of a superfluous waste of fertile</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      soil, the conquerors obtained the command of a naval force,</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      sufficient to transport their armies to the coast of Asia. 102</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      These ships used in the navigation of the Euxine were of a very</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      singular construction. They were slight flat-bottomed barks</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      framed of timber only, without the least mixture of iron, and</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      occasionally covered with a shelving roof, on the appearance of a</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      tempest. 103 In these floating houses, the Goths carelessly</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      trusted themselves to the mercy of an unknown sea, under the</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      conduct of sailors pressed into the service, and whose skill and</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      fidelity were equally suspicious. But the hopes of plunder had</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      banished every idea of danger, and a natural fearlessness of</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      temper supplied in their minds the more rational confidence,</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      which is the just result of knowledge and experience. Warriors of</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      such a daring spirit must have often murmured against the</a>

<a id='line_1634'>      conflagration blazed out at the same time in every district of</a>

<a id='line_1637'>      bring an army into the field, or even to defend their ruined</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      fortifications. The rage of war, both by land and by sea, spread</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      from the eastern point of Sunium to the western coast of Epirus.</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      The Goths had already advanced within sight of Italy, when the</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      approach of such imminent danger awakened the indolent Gallienus</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      from his dream of pleasure. The emperor appeared in arms; and his</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      presence seems to have checked the ardor, and to have divided the</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      strength, of the enemy. Naulobatus, a chief of the Heruli,</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      accepted an honorable capitulation, entered with a large body of</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      his countrymen into the service of Rome, and was invested with</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      the ornaments of the consular dignity, which had never before</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      been profaned by the hands of a barbarian. 124 Great numbers of</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      the Goths, disgusted with the perils and hardships of a tedious</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      voyage, broke into Mæsia, with a design of forcing their way over</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      the Danube to their settlements in the Ukraine. The wild attempt</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      would have proved inevitable destruction, if the discord of the</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      Roman generals had not opened to the barbarians the means of an</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      escape. 125 The small remainder of this destroying host returned</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      on board their vessels; and measuring back their way through the</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      Hellespont and the Bosphorus, ravaged in their passage the shores</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      of Troy, whose fame, immortalized by Homer, will probably survive</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      the memory of the Gothic conquests. As soon as they found</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      themselves in safety within the basin of the Euxine, they landed</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      at Anchialus in Thrace, near the foot of Mount Hæmus; and, after</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      all their toils, indulged themselves in the use of those pleasant</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      and salutary hot baths. What remained of the voyage was a short</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      and easy navigation. 126 Such was the various fate of this third</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      and greatest of their naval enterprises. It may seem difficult to</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      conceive how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      sustain the losses and divisions of so bold an adventure. But as</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      their numbers were gradually wasted by the sword, by shipwrecks,</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      and by the influence of a warm climate, they were perpetually</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      renewed by troops of banditti and deserters, who flocked to the</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      standard of plunder, and by a crowd of fugitive slaves, often of</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      German or Sarmatian extraction, who eagerly seized the glorious</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      opportunity of freedom and revenge. In these expeditions, the</a>

<a id='line_1820'>      wicked counsels, the Imperial army was betrayed into a situation</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      where valor and military skill were equally unavailing. 137 The</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      vigorous attempt of the Romans to cut their way through the</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      Persian host was repulsed with great slaughter; 138 and Sapor,</a>

<a id='line_1825'>      till the increasing rage of famine and pestilence had insured his</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      victory. The licentious murmurs of the legions soon accused</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      Valerian as the cause of their calamities; their seditious</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      clamors demanded an instant capitulation. An immense sum of gold</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      was offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat.</a>

<a id='line_1834'>      necessity of intrusting his life and dignity to the faith of an</a>

<a id='line_1866'>      if we may credit a very judicious historian, 141 the city of</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      Antioch was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing</a>

<a id='line_1869'>      Antioch, private as well as public, were either pillaged or</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      destroyed; and the numerous inhabitants were put to the sword, or</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      led away into captivity. 142 The tide of devastation was stopped</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of Emesa.</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes, he appeared at the head of a</a>

<a id='line_1878'>      this singular instance, the conquest of Syria and Cilicia</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      scarcely interrupted the progress of the Persian arms. The</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      advantages of the narrow passes of Mount Taurus were abandoned,</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      in which an invader, whose principal force consisted in his</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      cavalry, would have been engaged in a very unequal combat: and</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      Sapor was permitted to form the siege of Cæsarea, the capital of</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      Cappadocia; a city, though of the second rank, which was supposed</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants. Demosthenes</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      commanded in the place, not so much by the commission of the</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      emperor, as in the voluntary defence of his country. For a long</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      time he deferred its fate; and when at last Cæsarea was betrayed</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      by the perfidy of a physician, he cut his way through the</a>

<a id='line_1891'>      take him alive. This heroic chief escaped the power of a foe who</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      might either have honored or punished his obstinate valor; but</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      many thousands of his fellow-citizens were involved in a general</a>

<a id='line_2330'>      II. The foundation of Alexandria was a noble design, at once</a>
<a id='line_2331'>      conceived and executed by the son of Philip. The beautiful and</a>
<a id='line_2332'>      regular form of that great city, second only to Rome itself,</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      comprehended a circumference of fifteen miles; 170 it was peopled</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      by three hundred thousand free inhabitants, besides at least an</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      equal number of slaves. 171 The lucrative trade of Arabia and</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      India flowed through the port of Alexandria, to the capital and</a>

<a id='line_2340'>      engaged in the pursuits of industry, nor did even the blind or</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      the lame want occupations suited to their condition. 172 But the</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      people of Alexandria, a various mixture of nations, united the</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      vanity and inconstancy of the Greeks with the superstition and</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      obstinacy of the Egyptians. The most trifling occasion, a</a>
